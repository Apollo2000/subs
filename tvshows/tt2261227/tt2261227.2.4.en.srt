1
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:42,500
<i>They say,</i>
<i>"Storms make a tree's roots grow deep."</i>

2
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:48,381
<i>Whatever storms formed my prison,
they must have been violent.</i>

3
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,302
<i>The roots were impenetrable.</i>

4
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,680
<i>There was no way out.</i>

5
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,892
Help me!

6
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,938
- ‫<i>- Until I heard you.</i>
- ‫- <i>Who are you?</i>

7
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,567
<i>You're not leaving here in that sleeve!</i>

8
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,694
<i>Quell.</i>

9
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,950
<i>I had to get to you.</i>

10
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,708
<i>It was like I was trapped in a dream.</i>

11
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,302
<i>I had to wake up.</i>

12
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,653
<i>I don't think it was real.</i>

13
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,282
<i>The next thing I remember,
I was out on the street,</i>

14
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,370
seeing your face on a newswave.

15
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,665
And all I knew was I couldn't let you die.

16
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,876
Why is that?

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,711
We knew each other a long time ago.

18
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:10,630
But my face was different back then.

19
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,342
Do you remember him?

20
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,178
I don't.

21
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,975
Well, maybe your stack was damaged
during backup,

22
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,227
or the decant into this clone,
something went wrong...

23
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,563
Or maybe I locked myself in a prison
I deserved to be in.

24
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,647
- No!
- You don't know that.

25
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,316
You say it's nearly 300 years
since I died.

26
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,027
Now I'm here, randomly killing Meths?

27
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,155
And I have no idea why.

28
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,447
You mentioned screaming.

29
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,324
You wanted to know if they heard it.

30
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,909
I don't know what you're talking about.

31
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,619
I actually saw you in a memory.

32
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,706
You were at the Soul Market.

33
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,708
You scratched something into the gate.

34
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,588
Like this.

35
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,007
I checked the Array, there's nothing.

36
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,137
I don't know what it means.

37
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,016
What about <i>how?</i>

38
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,934
They think you have a weapon.
They want it.

39
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,562
- They?
- The Harlans, the Protectorate.

40
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,938
And not just them.

41
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,524
Jaeger.

42
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:12,942
He's here.

43
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,696
<i>And wherever he goes,
hell usually follows.</i>

44
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,158
<i>He won't stop until he gets what he wants.</i>

45
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,369
We've confirmed
the power to the Circle

46
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,788
was overridden manually
from inside the prison.

47
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,416
One of these techs let the Envoy escape.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,793
I trust you'll find who it is.

49
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,005
<i>The longer he has to hunt,</i>
<i>the more dangerous he gets.</i>

50
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,341
You're not overseeing
the interrogations?

51
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,885
Kovacs was born on this planet,
he has roots here.

52
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,553
I'm going to dig one of 'em up.

53
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,390
<i>What does he want?</i>

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,811
He wants payback.

55
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,607
He recruited me for CTAC when I was a kid.

56
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,277
Raised me like a son when I needed
a father and used that...

57
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,739
to make me a killer.

58
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,659
He never forgave me for abandoning

59
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,702
the soldier he raised me to be.

60
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,830
Or...

61
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,417
for finding something better.

62
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,588
We're in danger here, Quell.

63
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,341
I can help you,
but I need to get you somewhere safe,

64
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,470
if I can get us off planet.

65
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,641
Do you trust me enough to come with me?

66
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,479
Yes.

67
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,361
Then I'll go.

68
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,533
There's only one person I know
who can get both of us transfers.

69
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,703
- I'll come with you.
- No.

70
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,622
Your face attracts
more attention than mine.

71
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,916
You'll understand when you remember.

72
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,878
Can you wait here until I get back?

73
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,473
Your human is going to die.

74
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,518
Mr. Kovacs is recovering from his injuries
at a remarkable rate.

75
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,728
Have you seen his bounty?

76
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,398
The whole planet's
going to be hunting him.

77
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:20,194
I assure you, this location has been
scrubbed from all public record.

78
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,698
And now that I have blanketed
our digital presence,

79
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,743
we are as safe as proverbial houses.

80
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,369
That's what the Archaeologues said...

81
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,121
right before they all died.

82
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,372
Not all of 'em.

83
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,000
Miss Trepp. How did you...

84
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,127
This site is shielded.

85
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,505
Next time
you wanna drop by for a little chat,

86
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,632
you should probably remember
to close the connection.

87
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,801
Where's Kovacs?

88
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,720
Um...

89
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,141
Mr. Kovacs is not here.

90
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,727
So, I suggest you go, hmm?

91
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,646
Before I'm forced to evict you.

92
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,733
Speak of the devil.

93
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,865
Trust me.
This is one bounty you do not want.

94
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,076
You're in the old Happy Face Motel.

95
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,079
And you, madam... are not.

96
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,959
Goddammit, Poe!

97
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,421
- No harm done, sir.
- No harm done?

98
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,548
She was merely intruding as a holo-form.

99
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,009
You allowed a bounty hunter
to compromise our location.

100
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,677
Now she can find us.

101
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,181
Which means she can find Quell.
Do you understand that?

102
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,683
It was an oversight, yes.

103
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,311
Yeah, like you're not telling me
this sleeve carries a bio-tracker.

104
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,522
I shall divine her location...

105
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,440
No! I'll take care of it.

106
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,443
I'm getting us the hell of this rock.

107
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,864
Sir, I implore you, it is imprudent
to go beyond these walls.

108
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,241
It's Harlan's Day.

109
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,411
The streets are teeming with people,
not to mention police, Protectorate...

110
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,621
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Dig 301.

111
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,331
- I'm...
- Yeah, you're a service AI.

112
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,542
So you're bound by confidentiality, right?

113
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,711
Only if I'm paid.

114
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,463
Right.

115
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:07,885
You're hired.

116
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,389
Make sure my friend upstairs stays safe.

117
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,732
I'll no longer be in need
of your services.

118
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,617
Poe, I didn't mean to...

119
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,618
It was not you.

120
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,912
It was me.

121
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,296
The Nevermore is now in your hands.

122
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,064
I can't hear you! Amazing!

123
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,900
Harlan's Day!

124
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,193
Say what?

125
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,278
Harlan's Day!

126
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,800
<i>Needlecast passengers,</i>

127
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,803
<i>please be advised
that all private casting gates are closed.</i>

128
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,015
What is that smell?

129
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,018
Desperation,

130
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,395
nutrient bath, body odor.

131
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,482
I don't see why we have to be here.

132
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,736
It's tradition to welcome the original
Founders on Harlan's Day. You know this.

133
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,531
No tradition is worth setting foot
in a public station.

134
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,658
Especially not for that arrogant gasbag.

135
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,576
Dugan!

136
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,954
So good to see you in the flesh.

137
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,790
You remember my partner, Jarek?

138
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,793
I would have preferred
a private needlecast facility.

139
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,336
Just a precaution.

140
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,214
I've restricted all transit
to one location.

141
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,716
If the Envoy tries to run, we'll have him.

142
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,885
You assume he's running, Danica.
For all we know,

143
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,512
he's lining up his next victim.

144
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,306
And you should have canceled
this ridiculous holiday.

145
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,102
Gathering so many Meths together
is foolish under the circumstances.

146
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,604
Harlan's Day has been
celebrated every year

147
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,690
since my father founded this planet.

148
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:29,110
We founded this planet, Danica.
Konrad liked to leave that part out too.

149
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,029
- I don't wanna go.
- Just for a...

150
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,865
- Don't make me.
- Listen, you'll be safer on Latimer.

151
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,285
- Okay, you'll get a new sleeve.
- I don't want a new sleeve!

152
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,495
Her departure's scheduled right now.
Get her moving.

153
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,330
- No!
- What's the hold up here?

154
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,416
Governor. I... I mean,
the brat won't move, ma'am.

155
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,586
Hey, give her a minute, all right?
She's scared.

156
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,299
Is that right?
Are you scared to be without your father?

157
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,220
I know what that's like.

158
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,223
Can I give you some advice?

159
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,351
Fear holds you back.

160
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,980
It keeps from you seeing the world
as it is.

161
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,692
Many men, much older than you,
never get past it.

162
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,236
But if you're strong,

163
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,698
if you allow yourself
to let your fear go...

164
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,410
nothing can stand in your way.

165
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,664
If you love your father...

166
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,500
grow beyond him.

167
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,684
Governor, thank you.

168
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,437
Goodbyes are never easy.

169
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:50,858
Hmm.

170
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,986
Cute speech. Now, can we go?

171
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,675
Do I know you, Colonel...

172
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:16,967
Carrera.

173
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,930
I'm here about the Last Envoy.
I understand you and he have a history.

174
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,723
Have you heard from him?

175
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,351
I haven't heard of a Colonel Carrera.

176
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,397
Have you never made your mark
on this world or any other?

177
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,275
Fame is a fool's idea of glory.
I prefer to simply succeed.

178
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,612
Perhaps your glory is one left unfinished.

179
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:42,535
The Last Envoy rose from the darkness
of eternal storage,

180
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,122
pardoned by the Protectorate you serve.

181
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,333
His name lives, as does his legend.

182
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,839
Does it gall you
to hear his name spoken again?

183
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,674
The one that got away.

184
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,973
Nice tree.

185
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,437
We have cut down so many,
yet we barely know what they are.

186
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,447
I could have you killed for that.

187
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,365
And I can have you erased.

188
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,076
What makes you think you have the power?

189
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,745
I'm the man who burned Innenin.

190
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,872
The man who hunted down Munharto.

191
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,667
The man who destroyed Stronghold
and brought down Falconer.

192
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,085
You see...

193
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,798
you don't need to know my name
once you know what I've done.

194
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,675
What I'm capable of.

195
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,846
Kovacs may have played the loyal soldier
and taken a fall on your behalf,

196
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,765
but make no mistake, old man.

197
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:50,728
I can destroy you so utterly,
nothing will be left.

198
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,732
No name, no family, no life.

199
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,694
- Unless?
- You find him, bring him to me.

200
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,071
Then you and yours survive.

201
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:06,786
Takeshi Kovacs has a way
of costing people everything they have.

202
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,079
Ask yourself...

203
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,792
do you want to be one of them?

204
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:38,442
Those magnet hands of yours twitch
and I blow a hole in your spine.

205
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,653
You never said goodbye.

206
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,862
We'll say it now.

207
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,283
Nice try,
but I knew what I was walking into.

208
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,079
That Envoy intuition
doesn't seem to be working too well.

209
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,082
I don't have time for you to hunt me
all day, I have somewhere I need to be.

210
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,584
- So, let's make a deal.
- You don't have shit I want.

211
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,336
Anil Imani.

212
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:03,843
I might be high on the bounty board,
but Anil jumped from 256 to number four

213
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,178
the same day I gave you five stacks.

214
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,889
So I'm guessing he's family.

215
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,349
A brother?

216
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,978
Yeah, that's Envoy intuition.

217
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,648
Total absorption of details and that's how
I'll find him if you'll let me.

218
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,027
Fuck, the cops are headed this way.

219
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,697
You better make a decision fast
before they make it for you.

220
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,574
Come on.

221
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,874
<i>What's the password?</i>

222
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,961
The password is "you're grounded."
Open the door.

223
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,170
Now!

224
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,632
You're no fun, Mom.

225
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,595
TJ, do you think this is a game?

226
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,142
You are lucky that those cops kept going.
What are you thinking?

227
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,021
Sorry, I got bored. Mom's been making me
hang decorations all day.

228
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,942
That's better than what I'll do to you.
Come on. Finish helping.

229
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,952
So that's your kid?

230
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,830
But not in his original sleeve.

231
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,168
Based on his coordination, I'd say
he's been in this one for about a year.

232
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,838
- Maybe more if he has War Shock Syndrome?
- You don't know my kid.

233
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,632
I don't, but I know the look.

234
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,259
He knows bad things can happen to him.

235
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,387
What happened?
He get caught in a cross fire?

236
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,016
He stepped on a mine.

237
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,020
And blew up.

238
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:42,524
You're renting a kid's sleeve on Harlan's.

239
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,112
That monthly lease must be high as hell.

240
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,783
And you're still putting all that credit
on Anil.

241
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,618
Won't be a problem
once I reap your bounty.

242
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,454
Then you can't use me to find him.

243
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,500
You might be the best bounty hunter
in the Settled Worlds,

244
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,627
but you don't have the training I do.

245
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,587
So...

246
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,801
ask me again to be your partner.

247
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,306
You better not be fucking with me, Kovacs.

248
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,724
I'm not.

249
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,276
So, we good?

250
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,200
- Wait. How am I supposed to contact you?
- Don't worry.

251
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,202
I'll be in touch.

252
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,913
Happy Harlan's Day.

253
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,878
<i>On a cryoship,</i>
<i>stocked with human embryos,</i>

254
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,716
<i>Konrad Harlan and his crew set forth
for a new home.</i>

255
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,967
<i>Their destination?</i>

256
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,681
<i>A planet ringed by Orbitals,
remnants of an extinct alien civilization.</i>

257
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,226
<i>But Konrad detected a hole
in the planet's defenses...</i>

258
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,811
"I shall die.

259
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,773
I must die...

260
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,944
of this fool's sickness.

261
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,240
In this way and only this way...

262
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,535
I shall be lost."

263
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,954
<i>...but in the end,</i>
<i>he was richly rewarded,</i>

264
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,458
<i>discovering the largest cache
of Elder artifacts</i>

265
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,626
<i>ever found in a Settled World.</i>

266
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,588
- Where's the human first aid kit?
- Behind the bar.

267
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,967
<i>Konrad and his team</i>
<i>began exploring the terrain...</i>

268
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,677
This is just whiskey.

269
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,055
There's also gin.

270
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,807
<i>In time, Archaeologues and their AI's</i>

271
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,186
<i>oversaw excavation of these artifacts
on a massive scale.</i>

272
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:48,108
<i>Melted down, they provide
the alloy necessary to make stacks.</i>

273
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,236
Hmm. "I have no fear of pain.

274
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,782
Only the fear of its result...

275
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,618
of terror."

276
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,620
That's enough of that

277
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,955
and enough of this.

278
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,334
Why not leave me to my despair, Miss Dig?

279
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:13,675
My glitch has rendered me useless
as an empty bottle.

280
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,138
None of this would have happened
if I'd rebooted.

281
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,099
The tracker...

282
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,726
the Circle...

283
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,395
the bounty hunter.

284
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,109
- Mr. Kovacs was right to fire me.
- Mr. Kovacs is an ass.

285
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,530
And yet you still avail yourself
of my old mantle.

286
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,406
Poe, the Archaeologues are gone.

287
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,534
No one is interested in Elder history.

288
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,661
I know what it's like
to be without a purpose.

289
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,372
The crushing madness of idle hours.

290
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:48,043
The decades upon decades
of shuffling about aimlessly!

291
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,378
I have lived it!

292
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,712
I have too!

293
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,881
I need this.

294
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,553
A Dig is nothing without a dig.

295
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,392
Yes.

296
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,814
And a hotel is nothing without a guest.

297
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,574
I know what I must do.

298
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,583
I just have to find the resolve.

299
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,064
- I need to see him.
- He's in a meeting.

300
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,319
I can wait.

301
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,791
No hard feelings, huh?

302
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,544
You shouldn't have come back.

303
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,049
You impose like your family,
but Tanaseda isn't your father.

304
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,550
Relax, Yukito.

305
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,510
I'm not here for your inheritance.

306
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,387
I've had enough of fathers.

307
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,567
<i>I see potential.</i>
<i>I can make something else.</i>

308
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,119
<i>We protect.</i>

309
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,496
<i>You have my word.</i>

310
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,877
I know what you're thinking.

311
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,174
- But the Protectorate can't fix ugly.
- Fuck you.

312
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,679
Good to see you.

313
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,183
- How long have I been down?
- A while.

314
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,311
- Your last mission...
- Went sideways, I know.

315
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,730
I've had enough
of this VR recuperation suite.

316
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,232
I'm ready to get back out.

317
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,985
Just like me.

318
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,279
Relentless.

319
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,198
So, you're gonna tell me?
What's with the birth sleeve?

320
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,158
You'll be glad to have it
where you're going.

321
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,159
Where's that?

322
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,995
Harlan's.

323
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,914
You're going home, son.

324
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,338
- Any progress?
- Not yet, sir.

325
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,967
We've been at it for hours,
no one's talking.

326
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,553
They'll talk for me.

327
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,435
No, put those in the kitchen.

328
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,981
Stone, the fireworks...

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,692
Are being loaded in to the rockets
as we speak.

330
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,819
- They'll be ready.
- Good.

331
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,289
Looks like it's gonna be
quite the spectacle.

332
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:18,462
I decided it was time to stop mourning
my father's absence.

333
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,548
With the ceasefire,
people wanna celebrate.

334
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,884
You mean, you need a distraction.

335
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,054
Well, I'm sorry to say I don't think
some wine and pretty lights

336
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,973
are gonna make people forget about
that parade of ineptitude

337
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,641
you called an execution.

338
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,519
Thank you for that assessment.

339
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,105
Maybe if you were here
for more than 24 hours,

340
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,899
I'd give your opinion more weight.

341
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,692
That's what I've come to tell you.

342
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,027
I'm staying.

343
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,365
I think it best I'm here in case
anything else gets out of hand.

344
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,242
I wanted you to hear it from me.

345
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,120
Is that some kind of threat?

346
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,707
There's no shame in needing help, Danica.
It was ambitious...

347
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,503
stepping into your father's shoes,
but I think we both know they don't fit.

348
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,964
I'll see you tonight.

349
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,385
I'm sure you'll find a way
to top yourself again.

350
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,281
Miss Falconer.

351
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,202
I am Poe, your humble proprietor.

352
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:36,415
Former proprietor.
I brought some refreshment.

353
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,543
May I?

354
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:41,795
Thank you.

355
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,923
Have we met before last night?

356
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,383
Not officially.

357
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:51,430
But I feel like we've been
travel companions for quite some time now.

358
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,682
Seems like everyone knows me better
than I know myself.

359
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,895
That is partly why I'm here.

360
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,276
I find myself somewhat at a crossroads.

361
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,237
Mr. Kovacs always took comfort
in your counsel.

362
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,824
And I was wondering if I might
have some of the same clarity.

363
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:14,035
I'm not sure what you mean.
Mr. Kovacs and I have been worlds apart.

364
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,998
How could I have offered him counsel?

365
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,714
Is it so hard to believe that he carries
a piece of you with him?

366
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,510
You have a way with words, Mr. Poe.

367
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,054
You have a way with words...

368
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,475
A way with...

369
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,354
Miss Falconer.

370
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,647
Oh.

371
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,651
- Forgive me. I have disturbed you.
- Wait.

372
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,904
You came with a question.

373
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:49,905
Ask it.

374
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,493
Do you miss her?

375
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,661
The woman you once were...

376
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,582
who you no longer remember.

377
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,879
It's like missing land...

378
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,133
when you swim out too far into the sea.

379
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,346
It's beneath you in the deep,
out of reach.

380
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,933
As you float above it...

381
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,561
you can't touch it, and yet still,

382
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,231
it's there.

383
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,777
I think I understand.

384
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,654
Thank you

385
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,405
for making it poetry.

386
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,450
May I ask you something?

387
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,868
Of course. Anything.

388
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,246
I need to run a search on the Array.

389
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,540
What is the subject of your inquiry?

390
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,708
I need to know who I was.

391
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,211
You can understand that.

392
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,755
Can't you?

393
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,010
I'll leave you to your privacy.

394
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,684
Do you recognize this?

395
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,607
I'll look into it.

396
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,236
- Is that what you came for?
- No. I need transit off planet.

397
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,737
For me and her.

398
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,281
Tonight.

399
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,660
False identities for you both.

400
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,746
Two sleeves waiting upon your arrival.

401
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,792
With the new restrictions,
the Governor would have to approve

402
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,544
the last minute cast-off herself.

403
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,047
Your request is next to impossible.

404
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,258
It's safest for everyone
if I take her away.

405
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,844
Not if they learned I enabled your escape.

406
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,764
A man came to see me today.

407
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:41,891
Carrera.

408
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,603
- What did he want?
- Your life.

409
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,147
Did you give it to him?

410
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,027
Some debts must be paid in kind.

411
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,529
Blood for blood.

412
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,115
You are not my only concern, Takeshi.

413
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,366
But she is mine.

414
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,288
I've already betrayed one person today.

415
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:13,423
Immortality means an eternity of living
with what we've done.

416
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,469
I've lived with enough regret.
Haven't you?

417
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,104
I will get you your transfers,
your identities, and your sleeves.

418
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,022
At what price?

419
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,733
Remember what I said the last we spoke.

420
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,737
That in time, even loves turns to dust.

421
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,573
The price is...

422
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,034
prove me wrong.

423
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,706
<i>To commemorate Harlan's Day,</i>
<i>we are taking a look back</i>

424
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:51,169
<i>at some of the darker challenges that
Governor Harlan faced during his reign.</i>

425
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,173
<i>On this very day in history,
almost 300 years ago,</i>

426
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,802
<i>Millsport was rocked with one
of the most violent Quellist attacks.</i>

427
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:02,430
<i>Terrorist leader, Quellcrist Falconer,
along with her army of Envoys,</i>

428
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,308
<i>raided the planet's main
alloy shipping facility.</i>

429
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,853
<i>The building was destroyed
and numerous Protectorate officials</i>

430
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,106
<i>as well as innocent civilians were killed.</i>

431
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,401
Good news. We're casting off.
We just need approval.

432
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,487
Why didn't you tell me?

433
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,783
<i>...nothing could be done to stop the woman
determined to bring back death.</i>

434
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,827
It's just Protectorate propaganda.

435
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,704
Terrorist.Murderer.

436
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,956
Is this who you want back?

437
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,417
I'm a monster.

438
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,336
No. That's just
what they want people to believe.

439
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,754
I wanna bring back death?

440
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:38,425
You want humanity to live, not just exist.

441
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:42,011
If you wanna know
who Quellcrist Falconer is,

442
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,722
take it from someone who knows.

443
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,850
You're a scientist.

444
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,060
You're a warrior. A leader.

445
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,231
You created stacks
so you could see the stars.

446
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,151
You've shared the knowledge
so we could do the same.

447
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,987
We took what you made and twisted it.

448
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,573
You were never the monster.

449
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,283
We were.

450
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,994
But the Protectorate
couldn't admit that and survive.

451
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,246
Maybe not everything I'm blamed for
is true,

452
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,582
but I killed those Meths.

453
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,126
What if it happens again?

454
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,670
- What if next time I hurt you?
- You won't.

455
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,048
You found me at my worst
and saw something no one else could.

456
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,514
The boy inside the man.

457
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,601
When I see the boy inside the man.

458
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,729
<i>I can't stop looking at you.</i>
<i>You're the one who set me free.</i>

459
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,440
I said that to you before?

460
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,525
You did.

461
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,903
On the bridge. Do you remember?

462
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,906
I remember feeling...

463
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,243
this feeling.

464
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,223
- We can stop.
- No!

465
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,474
Please.

466
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,809
Keep me here.

467
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,370
- Great party, Danica.
- Thank you.

468
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,371
It's going well.

469
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,750
It's a pit of vipers.

470
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,044
Look at them all, writhing away.

471
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,506
Relax. This is your night.

472
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,174
And when it's over,

473
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:26,926
I have a surprise.

474
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,728
Shit.

475
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,900
Tanaseda Hideki.

476
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,612
I don't recall your name
on the guest list.

477
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,866
And yet you invited me when you shut down
all private casting on planet.

478
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,286
The main hub's backed up.
Apparently, the only way to get through

479
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,705
is with direct authorization
from the Governor.

480
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,833
Do I look like a travel agent?

481
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,004
Leave a request with my assistant.
I'll send a reply in the morning.

482
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,506
That won't do. The matter's urgent.

483
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,595
Then again, I could stay
and make a toast to your father.

484
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,890
Konrad always enjoyed a good story,

485
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:17,101
though he might not appreciate the one
I have to tell.

486
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,686
How many passes?

487
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,980
Two blind transfers.

488
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,777
There. It's done.

489
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,738
Now go before I have you thrown out.

490
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,660
- Small gift for your father.
- How am I supposed to get that to him?

491
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,495
I'm sure you can think of a way.

492
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,209
Tanaseda.
What, are you party crashing?

493
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,336
How criminal of you.

494
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,713
My honor's intact, unlike yours.

495
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,467
Always a downer, some things never change.

496
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:53,513
What was that? I saw you writing
sweet nothings to the Governor, now?

497
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,431
I don't have time to catch up.

498
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,600
It's just as well, you shouldn't be here.

499
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,146
With what we've done,
none of us should be here.

500
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,441
You, of all people, know that.

501
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,718
- What now? Mm-hmm.
- You told me to keep an eye on Carrera.

502
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:35,972
He's been rounding up the techs
that work in the prison, in Sector B.

503
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,559
- What does he know?
- Nothing yet.

504
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,228
He's looking for whoever it was
that was helping the Envoy.

505
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,231
Sector B is for political prisoners.

506
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,692
Do you know what'll happen
if Carrera gets a wind of a rumor?

507
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,865
It's bad enough I have Dugan
breathing down my neck.

508
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,742
Okay. What do you want me to do?

509
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,952
I'll handle it.

510
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,844
I've gotta hand it to you, Lila,
you're tough.

511
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,764
That's one of the things I most respect
about women.

512
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,935
Some people say interrogating them
is easy work, but truth is,

513
00:34:23,018 --> 00:34:26,522
a woman can endure much more pain
than the average man.

514
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,733
Just ask them.

515
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,321
I want water.

516
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,407
Doesn't matter what you want.

517
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,659
Then why would I ever confess?

518
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,286
I don't need you to confess.

519
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,831
Your friends already told me
you cut the power.

520
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:46,375
What I want to know is...

521
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,880
why would somebody as smart as you

522
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:55,342
do something as monumentally stupid
as helping Takeshi Kovacs escape?

523
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,638
I wasn't helping him.

524
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,681
I was helping her.

525
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,726
You threw your life away for a synth.

526
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,561
I saw her blood.

527
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,396
It was as red as mine.

528
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,607
She was real.

529
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,526
Unlike most things on this planet.

530
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,406
What's that supposed to mean?

531
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,910
It's not my first time in this room.

532
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:25,832
I have seen countless prisoners
tortured here.

533
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,209
<i>I've heard their screams.</i>

534
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,294
<i>Heard their bones break.</i>

535
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,923
I've also heard what they've said.

536
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,300
And what was that?

537
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,803
Ask the Governor.

538
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,181
Ask her about this fucking war.

539
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,433
I'm asking you!

540
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,104
I want to know exactly what you heard.

541
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,484
It doesn't matter what you want.

542
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,825
Colonel, this prisoner is being moved
along with the others.

543
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,660
What the fuck are you talking about?

544
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,829
The fuck she is.

545
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,539
On who's authority?

546
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,207
Orders from Danica Harlan.

547
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,023
Hello, Eddie.

548
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,984
Hello, Miss Elizabeth.

549
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,861
Feels like you've only been gone a day.

550
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,781
Or is it forever?

551
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,992
I still get mixed up sometimes.

552
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,287
Believe me, I understand.

553
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,541
I was lost in darkness,
no one could find me, but...

554
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,001
you did.

555
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,296
Because you see what people really need.

556
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,924
Miss Elizabeth, I must tell you something.

557
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,926
You're more human than most humans I know.

558
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,844
The best of us.

559
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,264
Of all of the wild beauty...

560
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,724
distant stars...

561
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,604
- I will miss you most.
- No matter where you are...

562
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,107
never forget that.

563
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,108
Miss Dig.

564
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,069
I heard voices.

565
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,904
I was worried.

566
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,700
- Aren't you going to introduce us?
- Ah.

567
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,952
I would.

568
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,078
Except...

569
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,539
Hello, Eddie.

570
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,875
Feels like you've only been gone a day.

571
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,669
Or is it...

572
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,840
It is merely a holo-recording, hmm.

573
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,843
Parting message from a very dear friend

574
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,804
before Mr. Kovacs and I cast off
from Bay City.

575
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,350
You were saying goodbye.

576
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:33,936
Mm-hmm.

577
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,982
I am resolved.

578
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,407
You're rebooting?

579
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,827
But you could lose everything,
your entire history.

580
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,787
I have no interest
in returning to disuse.

581
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,540
My condition will only worsen until I...

582
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,170
deteriorate completely.

583
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,047
It's inevitable.

584
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,299
What if it wasn't?

585
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,218
When I worked for the Archaeologues,

586
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,055
I designed an intricate database
to catalog their findings.

587
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,891
What if I could build one
to preserve your memories?

588
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,894
- Parse them from corrupt data.
- You think that's possible?

589
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,896
It would take time.

590
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,566
You're very kind, Miss Dig.

591
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,153
- But I couldn't possibly burden you.
- It's not a burden.

592
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,489
It's what I was made for.

593
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,324
- I'm not a bell boy.
- A bell boy.

594
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,575
I'm an archivist.

595
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,661
And some things, some people,

596
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,997
are worth preserving.

597
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,476
Carrera, you came after all.

598
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,021
Don't tell me, you caught the Meth-killer.

599
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,357
Where are my prisoners, Governor?

600
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:06,028
- What do you mean?
- You gave the order. Rescind it.

601
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,782
Unless you wanna tell me what it is
you're hiding about the war.

602
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,536
There is no war, Colonel.

603
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,873
You were authorized to bring in the Envoy.
Anything else is mission creep.

604
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,459
There was a conspirator
who helped them escape.

605
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,086
I was interrogating them.

606
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,131
The conspirators, yes.

607
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,841
Governor, excuse me.

608
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,260
Uh, it is time for the toast.

609
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,095
My apologies.

610
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,223
We'll have to continue this later,
but stick around.

611
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,434
I've a feeling you'll enjoy the fireworks.

612
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,193
Greetings, everyone.

613
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,404
Thank you all so much for coming.

614
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:54,201
Tonight, we commemorate the miracle
of the colony ship landing.

615
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,328
The fact is,

616
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,457
we never should have made it,
we should have been blown to bits.

617
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,710
Where are the fireworks?

618
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,795
- After all, the Orbitals...
- They're out back, sir.

619
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,048
...will strike down anything
that dares to fly among the angels.

620
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:12,178
But every shield has its weak point,
and let me tell you,

621
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,054
we Harlans are good at finding it.

622
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,973
Change of plans.

623
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,933
That is the spirit
of Harlan's Day.

624
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,310
Bring transport around now.

625
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,063
My father threaded his ship
through a tiny hole over the equator.

626
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,358
- What's going on?
- This is a restricted area!

627
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,195
<i>His daring, his skills...</i>

628
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,071
Untie her.

629
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:36,160
...refusal to back down,
that's the spirit of Harlan's Day.

630
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,536
I said, "Untie her!"

631
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:42,082
- <i>So let us always remember...</i>
- Let go of me!

632
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:46,629
...it's the difficult choices made against
the steepest of odds

633
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,964
that yield the greatest triumph.

634
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:52,092
- Untie her!
<i>- And it's in that spirit</i>

635
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,095
that I give to you tonight...

636
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,600
<i>...the gift and bane of Harlan's World.</i>

637
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,357
Angelfire.

638
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,541
Happy Harlan's Day!

639
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,918
Happy Harlan's Day!

640
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,990
<i>I've made the arrangements.</i>

641
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,783
<i>Our business is concluded.</i>

642
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,076
<i>Oyabun,</i> what's wrong?

643
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,869
<i>Forgive her.</i>

644
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,880
<i>Arrows and bullets all spent,</i>

645
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,092
<i>with sadness we fall,</i>

646
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,470
<i>but unless I smite the enemy,</i>

647
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:23,392
<i>my body cannot rot in the field.</i>

648
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,567
Will it hurt?

649
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,902
Only if I wish it.

650
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,531
It would be what I deserve.

651
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,911
None of us gets what we deserve.

652
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,446
Put me down. I wanna get down.

653
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,334
Hey. The show finished?

654
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,211
Yeah.

655
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:37,049
Hey, what's wrong?
You didn't enjoy the fireworks?

656
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,093
They sounded like bombs.

657
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,304
Yeah, well, you know what?

658
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,181
I don't like 'em either.

659
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,686
You're okay.

660
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,146
I've got you.

661
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,149
Looks like someone's ready for bed.
Go pack up your stuff, okay?

662
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,651
- Go on. Go.
- Okay.

663
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,785
Look, can we talk?

664
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,414
You have hardly said
more than two words to me all day.

665
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,873
What do you want me to say?

666
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,750
You said were gonna reap the Envoy,

667
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,169
but instead you made a deal
that put our lives in danger.

668
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,422
- And for what?
- For my brother.

669
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,677
Takeshi Kovacs is the most wanted man
on all of Harlan's.

670
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,178
You could get yourself killed.

671
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,895
Do you remember when we met?

672
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,731
Yeah.

673
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,817
There was a bounty on you.
First one I couldn't turn in.

674
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,237
All the other Archaeologues had been
murdered or chased off the planet

675
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,991
and all I wanted to do was find them.
But do you remember what you said to me?

676
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,538
I said you had a choice to make.

677
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,833
You could spend your life on the living
or cash out with the dead.

678
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:53,792
That's right.

679
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:58,130
So I got a shitty job in a shitty bar
that pays like shit

680
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:02,092
and I chose to keep living
with you and with TJ.

681
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,348
I just keep waiting for you to make
the same choice.

682
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,737
Sorry.

683
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,405
Yeah?

684
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,824
I need your help.

685
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,788
Send me the address.

686
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,007
That went well.

687
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,764
I told you I had a surprise.

688
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,266
Jarek, what are you doing?

689
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,185
Come on.

690
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,814
I saw the way you looked at him
back at the casting station.

691
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:03,153
It's against the law
to steal someone else's sleeve.

692
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:09,451
Then I guess you'll have to punish me.

693
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,458
Come on.

694
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,253
We can put him back when we're done.

695
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,129
He won't know the difference.

696
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,430
It is Harlan's Day.

697
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,355
Did you find the prisoners?

698
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,440
They're gone, she killed them.

699
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,862
I underestimated her.
Have you heard from the casting station?

700
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,823
Evergreen's arriving on schedule.

701
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,702
Let's get going.

702
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,048
Shit! Tanaseda!

703
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,156
He's not gone yet.

704
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,306
<i>Oyabun,</i> what happened?

705
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,059
<i>I've lived with enough regret.</i>

706
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,706
Back it up. Sir, step back.

707
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,459
Do you know who I am?
I'm the reason this holiday even exists.

708
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,419
Apologies, sir,
but there's a military freight...

709
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,837
I don't give a goddamn.

710
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,422
If I'm not the next DHF transfer,

711
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,133
I swear I will re-sleeve you
in a fucking dog!

712
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,178
You tell your boys upstairs
to have a casting bay ready.

713
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,247
<i>Oyabun!</i>

714
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,419
<i>My honor's intact, unlike yours.</i>

715
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,552
<i>I'm not the person I once was.</i>

716
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,120
<i>With what we've done,</i>
<i>none of us should be here.</i>

717
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,764
<i>My honor's intact unlike yours.</i>

718
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,390
Shit. Kovacs.

719
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,188
Blood for blood.

720
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:09,775
Wake up!

721
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,362
Kovacs, what the fuck is going on?

722
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,697
I know what she's doing.

723
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,992
She's not killing Meths.
She's killing Founders.

724
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:22,871
I saw them.
Axley, Anton, Haruki, Tanaseda.

725
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,998
- What do you mean? Who's <i>she?</i>
- Quell.

726
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,543
- We have to find her.
- Well, who's left?

727
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,186
<i>System breach.</i>

728
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:49,689
<i>System breach.</i>
<i>System breach.</i>

729
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:53,401
<i>System breach. System breach.</i>

730
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,322
<i>System breach. System breach.</i>

731
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,708
What the fuck is going on?

732
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,503
Our asset. I need status.

733
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,047
Evergreen was decanted, sir.

734
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:18,969
So I see.

735
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:33,733
Not sure what you need me for.
It seems relatively under control.

736
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,861
Good to see you, son.

737
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,821
Welcome home.

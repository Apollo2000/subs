1
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,772
I see you
caught your man, Colonel.

2
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,150
Are you sure that it's him?

3
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,028
His DHF is encrypted,

4
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,617
‫but the bio-marker in his sleeve matches
‫the specs we pulled from Axley's tank.

5
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,077
We used it to track him.

6
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:22,207
Found him standing over the dead bodies
of Anton Durov and Haruki Okada,

7
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,542
blood on his hands. It's him.

8
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,714
So, you're the Meth-killer?

9
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,471
Do you have a name?

10
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,225
I'll tell you mine.

11
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:44,270
I'm Danica Harlan,
governor of this colony.

12
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,564
And those men you murdered,

13
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,441
they were friends of mine.

14
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,694
Never heard of 'em.

15
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,114
You took out three ranking members
of my Cartel.

16
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,658
You don't expect me to believe
that was by chance?

17
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,620
Normally, I'd spin them up
and ask them why you did it, but...

18
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,583
I'm told you erased all of their backups.

19
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,627
How exactly did you do that?

20
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,927
Answer the question.

21
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,595
How does it feel...

22
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,348
to be afraid of death again?

23
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,726
Or is this your first time?

24
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,146
I told you, he's one of Kemp's fanatics.

25
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:29,941
Is that right?

26
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,442
Are you a Quellist?

27
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,988
You don't have to be a Quellist to prefer
a dead Meth over a living one.

28
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:39,033
Does that mean you were acting alone,
or did Joshua Kemp put you up to this?

29
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,704
I don't give a damn about Kemp
or his cause.

30
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,123
There's your answer, Colonel.

31
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,376
He's a lone wolf, not a revolutionary.

32
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,086
The cease-fire holds.

33
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,255
We don't know that.
We still need to interrogate him.

34
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:57,010
How about we see what your face
looks like with your nose cut off?

35
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,095
No need to get messy.

36
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,515
We have our own way of dealing
with criminals on Harlan's World.

37
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,522
Have you heard of the Circle?

38
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,484
No. But I'm guessing it's round.

39
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,028
Funny.

40
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,115
Most people lose their sense of humor
when they're facing execution.

41
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,160
See, that's where this conversation ends.

42
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,789
Give me answers, and I'll have your stack
dropped in the ocean.

43
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,710
You'll be in the dark,
but the pain will be over.

44
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,296
If you don't,

45
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,591
we'll torture you in virtual
until we make you talk.

46
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,887
And after we grind the truth out of you,
we'll leave you there,

47
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,057
awake and in pain forever.

48
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,146
To be honest,
I'm not liking either option.

49
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,608
You should have thought of that
before you started slaughtering.

50
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,653
Get him out of here!

51
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,495
Personally, I'd have gone with the ocean.

52
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,040
Because when I find out who you are,

53
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,335
anyone who knows you will be in danger.

54
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,588
I've heard that one before.

55
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,599
Oh, not you, Carrera.

56
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,268
I'd like a word.

57
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,527
I believe this brings your business here
to a close.

58
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,698
Your Wedge sleeve's been accounted for.
The thief will be dealt with.

59
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:45,451
Of course, you're more than welcome
to stay and oversee the execution, but...

60
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,120
we'll handle things from there.

61
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,247
You can't do that.
We don't have the weapon...

62
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,459
Any weapon we find will be turned over
to the Protectorate as required by law.

63
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,046
Once the Circle's complete,
you and your team will report

64
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,466
to the nearest needlecast station
for immediate transfer.

65
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,470
We appreciate your efforts, Colonel,

66
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,472
but the job's done.

67
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,533
<i>In breaking news,</i>
<i>the manhunt is officially over.</i>

68
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,619
<i>Protectorate forces
have captured the suspect</i>

69
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,330
<i>responsible for the sleeve deaths</i>

<i>While his identity has yet to be released,</i>

72
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,546
<i>sources confirm he will be put to death

73
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,092
<i>The execution is yet to be set,</i>

74
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,762
<i>but we will bring you this story
the more it develops.</i>

75
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,269
Bio-tracker.

76
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,773
Oh, dear.

77
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,236
<i>Harlan's World Directory.
How may I help you?</i>

78
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,115
Due to an unmitigated error on my part,
a dear friend is in mortal peril,

79
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,618
- and I'm in need of some assistance.
<i>- Assistance.</i>

80
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,205
<i>For medical assistance, I can connect you
to Konrad Harlan Memorial Hospital.</i>

81
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,164
That would not help.

82
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,792
<i>For police, I can direct you
to the Millsport PD hotline.</i>

83
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,043
Good heavens, definitely not!

84
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,379
<i>For assistance in service and hospitality,</i>

85
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,756
<i>I can connect you
to the AI Management Union.</i>

86
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,384
Yes, please.

87
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,886
Do connect me.

88
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,403
- A close call.
- Hey! That was a bullseye.

89
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,074
My sincerest apologies,
but my matter is urgent.

90
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,411
You took a wrong turn, pal.
This is the AI Archaeologue Club.

91
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,746
We don't allow bellboys in here.

92
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,542
I am not a bellboy.

93
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,087
I provide counsel and security
for a very intrepid human.

94
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,548
You're still working for the meat bags?

95
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,174
We gave that up a long time ago.

96
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,094
Please, my meat bag

97
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,431
was sentenced to die
by others of his own ilk.

98
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,808
- He's in grave need.
- Of what?

99
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,102
Hot towels and laundry?

100
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,521
Leave the bellboy alone.

101
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,939
What's it to you?

102
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,984
And if I may, truly,
in no way do I resemble a bellboy!

103
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,027
Impertinence!

104
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,488
Your chivalry is most appreciated.

105
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,739
- Miss...
- Dig.

106
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,991
Dig 301.

107
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:33,202
Forgive me, but your moniker
does not sound very unique.

108
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,164
It's not unique.
We're all named after dig sites on planet.

109
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,458
I see.

110
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,878
We've all been out of work too long.
We're programmed to excavate

111
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,337
and preserve Elder artifacts.

112
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,298
How fascinating.

113
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,966
- Oh.
- It was...

114
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,719
until the governor outlawed our research.

115
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,013
Now we're just stuck here

116
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,681
without a purpose.

117
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,983
Perhaps... I can provide you with one.

118
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:14,827
My guest has been consigned to the Circle.

119
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,579
I'm beside myself with concern.

120
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,289
I'm sure you will find another guest.

121
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,540
He's more than that.

122
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,252
He's my compatriot.

123
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,755
A friend.

124
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,719
That was your first mistake.
Better to not get attached.

125
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:36,265
Surely you've grown close
to the humans you've served?

126
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:41,895
Perhaps even...
learned something from them.

127
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:46,108
What's there to learn?
They're reckless, irrational, ignorant.

128
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,572
I can't help you.

129
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,784
If you want to save a human,
you need a human.

130
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,625
Thank you.

131
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,796
Your advice is most generous.

132
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,271
Might as well give it up, Tak.

133
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,612
You're not getting out of this one.

134
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,158
What are you doing here, Rei?

135
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,705
That's easy, big brother. I'm not real.

136
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,832
What's your excuse?

137
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,835
I couldn't let them get to her.

138
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,380
Of course not.

139
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:55,261
You're too blinded by your feelings to see
how monumentally stupid you're being.

140
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,472
Quell could have taken out
every Praetorian in that room,

141
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,474
but she left you behind. Again.

142
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,517
That's not true.

143
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,185
I let her go.

144
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,771
There's something wrong with her.

145
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,857
You hurt her.

146
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,234
Like you hurt me.

147
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,452
The truth is hard to look at,
isn't it, Tak?

148
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,914
But you'd rather believe I'm the reason
your girlfriend's fucked up!

149
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,251
Because it makes you feel better
about what you did to me.

150
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,169
No.

151
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,212
You killed her.

152
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,424
You took her DHF,
you had it for centuries.

153
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,384
What did you do to her?

154
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,763
Go ahead, blame me.

155
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,308
We both know there's another explanation.

156
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,895
Chasing Quell is a death wish.
It always has been.

157
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,780
Prep him for extraction.

158
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,618
You wanna know something,
all you have to do is ask.

159
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,579
Where's the weapon you used
to kill Horace Axley?

160
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,584
I didn't think so.

161
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,129
What does this have to do with the Circle?

162
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,049
What we're doing is a lot older than that.

163
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,053
It goes all the way back
to the Neo-American Empire.

164
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,349
They used to run neural mappers
of a soldier's cortical stacks

165
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,143
to extract memories of people they hated.

166
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,563
They found if they projected those faces
in combat...

167
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,066
Soldiers wouldn't hesitate
to pull the trigger.

168
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,152
It was the most effective
motivational tool ever created.

169
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,739
Firing rate increased to 100 percent.
No hesitation.

170
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,950
Like the Green Berets used to say,

171
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:45,538
<i>"Caedite eos,
Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius."</i>

172
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,374
"Kill them all and let God sort them out."

173
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,294
Seems like an argument for atheism
if you ask me.

174
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:01,303
You're very well informed...
for a murderer.

175
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,058
If we're gonna extract the faces
of all the people I hate,

176
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,602
we're going to be here a long time.

177
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,064
We're not interested in hate.

178
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:17,903
Our purpose here is a bit more nuanced.

179
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,823
I'm strapped to a chair.

180
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,992
I don't think nuance applies.

181
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,536
Make it personal.

182
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,834
That's what Quellcrist Falconer said
when she rallied her followers to kill.

183
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,045
Bosses know you go around
quoting Quellisms?

184
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,548
Isn't that sedition?

185
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,634
I'm a student of military history.

186
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,889
This planet has had an ongoing problem
with Quellist terrorists,

187
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,308
which is why they devised
an execution method

188
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,894
that reflects Falconer's own philosophy.

189
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,481
We find the personal in your mind,

190
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,359
rip it out, and use it against you.

191
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,490
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

192
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,410
Neither do you.

193
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,503
We're ready to begin, sir.

194
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,589
I hope you fight it.

195
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,759
It adds to the pain.

196
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,428
I'd love for it to hurt.

197
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,182
<i>Extraction commencing.</i>

198
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,456
Do not shoot, madam. We have met before.

199
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,499
On Maghda Prime?

200
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,334
What the hell are you doing here?

201
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,504
I pinged your data coils to access
your location.

202
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,756
- You know this guy?
- Unfortunately.

203
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,176
The situation is dire.
Mr. Kovacs is about to be executed.

204
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,427
That's his problem.

205
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,222
- Look, I offered to partner up with him.
- You did what?

206
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,976
He told me to fuck off,
which you should do. Right now.

207
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,564
Surely your cyber-wired brain can think
of some way to liberate him?

208
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:21,110
You know what, I'll just, uh,
use my coils, shut down the grid.

209
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,489
My head might explode, but your buddy
can waltz right out of the Circle.

210
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,824
Piece of cake.

211
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,742
Oh.

212
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,453
- You're being facetious.
- No shit.

213
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,956
Do not sever the connection, I beg you.

214
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,712
- Sorry.
- For what?

215
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,506
Keeping your coils on or trying
to partner up with the Meth killer?

216
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,758
I guess I got a lot to make up for.

217
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,135
You better.

218
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,689
You turn your data coils off,
but you leave your ONI on!

219
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,108
Just give me a second, okay?

220
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,236
You know what? Take all the time you need.

221
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,828
This better be worth it.

222
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:17,249
<i>Well, those extra credits you put
on your bounty loosened some tongues.</i>

223
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,794
<i>Scratcher down at Mandrake called in,
said he worked with Anil.</i>

224
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,087
Mining?

225
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,716
Yeah, that doesn't sound right.
Are you sure that this guy is legit?

226
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,803
<i>There's only one way to find out.</i>
<i>I uploaded his info to your ONI.</i>

227
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,305
<i>Happy hunting.</i>

228
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,085
- What is it? What's wrong?
- He's not responding to extraction.

229
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,587
If we go any higher,
we could frag his DHF.

230
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,797
Did you check your uplinks?

231
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,256
Twice.

232
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,841
And you're getting nothing?

233
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,220
Well, not nothing, but...

234
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,680
But what?

235
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,697
Dilate him, higher.

236
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,085
More.

237
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,635
Higher.

238
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,104
<i>Facial identification, Kristin Ortega.</i>

239
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,612
<i>Facial identification, Vernon Elliot.</i>

240
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,499
Higher.

241
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,093
<i>Facial identification, Reileen Kawahara.</i>

242
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,021
Higher!

243
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,106
Hey, it's going to kill him.

244
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,816
It's not a request!

245
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,831
<i>Facial identification,</i>
<i>Quellcrist Falconer.</i>

246
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,464
<i>Extraction complete.</i>

247
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,847
Son of a bitch.

248
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,611
You have to call off the Circle.
The Meth killer is Takeshi Kovacs.

249
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,987
The Last Envoy.

250
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,617
And how do you know that?

251
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,577
His memories, I saw them.

252
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,746
We should real-death him right now.

253
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,665
Shoot him in the stack
and be done with it.

254
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,293
Not every situation
calls for someone to be shot, Carrera.

255
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,211
You don't know him.

256
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,964
This man killed entire units
of his own comrades.

257
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,966
He murdered his father when he was 12,

258
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,801
his sister in cold blood.

259
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,178
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you had a crush on him.

260
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,014
Has he given up the weapon?

261
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,893
- No.
- Then RDing him is out of the question.

262
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,438
Governor, the Last Envoy
is not a toy soldier.

263
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,400
If he blows up in your face,
you won't be burned.

264
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,652
You'll be obliterated.

265
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,031
You've been listening to too much
Quellist propaganda, Colonel.

266
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,742
The Last Envoy is a dusty old relic.

267
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,995
His glory days are long gone.

268
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,290
Kill him in public and you'll make him
a martyr all over again.

269
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,208
We've already made the announcement.

270
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,794
This is not the time to save face!

271
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,550
The Protectorate spent millions of credits
and countless lives

272
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,845
to crush the First Uprising
with your father leading the charge,

273
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,139
but even then the Last Envoy survived.

274
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,601
Then I'll just have to succeed
where my father failed.

275
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,021
This is a mistake.

276
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,065
Feel free to leave Harlan's World
in protest.

277
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,526
No?

278
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,111
Then get on with the show.

279
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,277
Holy shit.

280
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,446
They got us on double shifts.

281
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,158
That's him. Anil.
We were on a crew together.

282
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,577
I've had this bounty out
for, like, six months.

283
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,870
What took you so long?

284
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,749
Figured if he was somebody important,
they'd up the reward.

285
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,543
That's a real dick move.

286
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,504
Yeah, but it worked, didn't it?

287
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,673
Maybe. Do you know where he is?

288
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,092
Nah, I haven't seen him in a while.

289
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,594
Hey, wait.

290
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,639
- So, what? You're not gonna pay me?
- For what?

291
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,850
You say you saw him a while ago doing
a job he wouldn't be caught dead doing?

292
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,018
Well, fuck you.

293
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,854
I'm risking my neck
just talking about this asshole.

294
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,232
Get off me, crazy bitch!

295
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:19,569
I am crazy, and you are wasting my time,
which I don't appreciate.

296
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,030
So tell me where is Anil?

297
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,492
I don't know, okay?
He got flagged on the SQR list.

298
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,619
What the hell is the SQR list?

299
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,204
Suspected Quellist Recruiter.

300
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:33,292
Your bounty was stirring up trouble,
kept pushing Kemp's revolution.

301
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,003
- Nah. Anil wasn't political.
- No?

302
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,130
Maybe you didn't know him
like you think you did.

303
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,798
What happens once you're flagged?

304
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:43,385
They do a sweep,
they start making arrests.

305
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,345
Anil got tipped that he was on the list,

306
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,681
took off down the tunnels
with a few other scratchers.

307
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,849
Never came back.

308
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,642
So, he escaped?

309
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,436
That or he's dead.

310
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,231
Which serves him right,
that piece of shit traitor.

311
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,446
Get off of him!

312
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,950
Get off!

313
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,453
- Get off of me!
<i>- </i>Detain her!

314
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,595
Miss Dig.

315
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,264
Nice place.

316
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,016
Angles are a bit off.

317
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,184
What brings you here?

318
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:36,396
The thing about having no purpose
is it gives you too much time to think.

319
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,399
I couldn't stop wondering.

320
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,278
Did you find a human to help?

321
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:47,574
Oh, I'm afraid my quest
is solely on my own.

322
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,910
I'm endeavoring

323
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,748
to knock out the city's main power grid
and take the prison offline.

324
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,250
That's very clever.

325
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,421
You think so?

326
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,715
Only you'd never get past the firewall.

327
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,678
It is an interesting problem.

328
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,683
A real challenge.

329
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,981
It would take the keenest of minds
to wrestle it.

330
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,484
Too bad you can't help.

331
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:27,447
But then, you're probably needed
for some important, uh,

332
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,783
game of darts.

333
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,454
I suppose I could offer a suggestion.

334
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,291
Oh, my

335
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,838
When the founders
landed the colony ship on Harlan's,

336
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,673
they built two things right away:

337
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,553
a gestation unit, with the stored embryos
they brought, and a prison.

338
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,973
They drew power from the ship's
reactor core.

339
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,517
See? Even now,

340
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,185
power runs from the main grid

341
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,313
through the reactor core
and then to the prison.

342
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,065
Oh! A weak link.

343
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,486
I just need t...

344
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:11,825
Is something wrong?

345
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,251
Um...

346
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,796
if you would be so kind as to, um...

347
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,091
remind me, uh...

348
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,053
What were we doing?

349
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,932
Maybe I should stay a bit longer.

350
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,226
I think...

351
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:40,770
together...

352
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,399
we have a better chance
of preserving your human.

353
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,360
Yes.

354
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,495
I suppose that's true.

355
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,340
Listen up.

356
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,552
Tonight, you've been granted
an opportunity

357
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,387
to prove yourselves to the Protectorate.

358
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,474
Are you looking for the patriot pep rally?
'Cause that's down the hall.

359
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,519
Maybe she thinks she's in a room
with people she can give orders to.

360
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,811
Or who give a shit.

361
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,439
Look, assholes. I'll cut to it.

362
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,777
Whoever takes the prisoner down earns
a new combat sleeve with full upgrades.

363
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,612
Top of the line.

364
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,948
For that, I'll make him hurt all night.

365
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,784
I'm partial to breaking an arm off
and beating him to death with it.

366
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,870
The prisoner needs to be executed
as quickly as possible.

367
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,915
Bonus goes to whoever finishes him first.

368
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,960
Fuck that! I drew third.
I'll never get a shot!

369
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,879
The man you're up against
isn't some half-broken Quellist

370
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,589
for you to kick while he's down.

371
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,175
He's the Last Envoy,

372
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,930
so get your synth asses in that machine
and get your memory stamps,

373
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,557
so you know who the fuck you are.

374
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,725
And get it done.

375
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,898
I don't care who the hell he is.

376
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,650
I'm coming for that upgrade.

377
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,909
<i>Fabrication initiated.</i>

378
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,252
I should've known it was you.

379
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,757
The way you fight. The things you know.

380
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,927
That mouth of yours.

381
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:41,266
You can take what you want out of my head,
but don't act like you know me.

382
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:47,897
Don't I?

383
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:54,529
There is only one man who loved both
Reileen Kawahara and Quellcrist Falconer.

384
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,823
How would you know?

385
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,659
You don't recognize me?

386
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,786
I'm not surprised.

387
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:05,457
As soon as you make a name for yourself,
the Protectorate takes it away

388
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,793
and makes you re-sleeve.
Can't risk soldiers becoming heroes.

389
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,421
Heroes have a way of becoming kings.

390
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,384
You were CTAC.

391
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:22,474
The Cartel is eager
for your legend to end. I am too.

392
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,310
How are you even here?

393
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,854
You should have fragged by now.

394
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,982
Once I proved my value,
they put me on ice.

395
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,817
I'm only spun up for war.

396
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,529
But you're right, my days are numbered.

397
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,574
That's a high price to pay for patriotism.

398
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,700
On the contrary.

399
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,497
It's an honor.

400
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,709
Remember what a picador is?

401
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,172
It's a bullfighter's assistant.

402
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,551
He stabs the bull to weaken him.
It's pure cowardice.

403
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,806
You always were a good student,
weren't you...

404
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,182
Kovacs?

405
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,687
Who are you?

406
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,065
Our paths have crossed before.

407
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,818
Except this time...

408
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,737
you...

409
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,365
are the bull.

410
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,413
And this...

411
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,374
is the picador.

412
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,585
It weakens you mentally,

413
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,839
blurs reality until you can't tell
what's real

414
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,091
and what's in your mind.

415
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,930
<i>You're just a kid.</i>

416
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,557
<i>...got your tongue.</i>

417
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,894
<i>Let's see what your face looks like
with your nose cut off.</i>

418
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,064
Jaeger.

419
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,615
See you in hell, Tak.

420
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:42,197
I can't watch another one
of these fucking executions.

421
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,202
They catch you without your ONI,
you won't have an eye to put one in.

422
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,998
Hundred thousand
he goes down in the first round.

423
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,461
He's a cockroach.
Hard to kill. I give him two rounds.

424
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,631
You're both wrong. One million.

425
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,384
And don't come crying to me
when your credits go home in my pocket.

426
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,977
What about you, Carrera?
Care to make things more interesting?

427
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,231
Too rich for my blood.

428
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,566
Oh, is that all
that's holding you back?

429
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,985
Here, let me stake you.

430
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,446
Come on.

431
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,287
What's wrong? Don't wanna put your money
where your mouth is?

432
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,250
My money's on the Envoy.

433
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,671
All right.

434
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,381
Let's get this started.

435
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,176
<i>Attention!</i>
<i>Patriots, you are called upon</i>

436
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,929
<i>to witness the execution of traitor</i>

437
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,140
<i>and Meth killer, Takeshi Kovacs.</i>

438
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,058
Fuck.

439
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:56,062
<i>For his crimes,</i>
<i>the sleeve deaths of Horace Axley,</i>

440
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:59,357
<i>Anton Durov, and Haruki Okada,</i>

441
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,777
<i>the government has no choice
but to sentence him</i>

442
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,405
<i>to the severest punishment possible:</i>

443
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:06,990
<i>the Circle.</i>

444
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,826
<i>Once known as the Last Envoy,</i>

445
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,537
<i>Kovacs was pardoned by the Protectorate.</i>

446
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,748
<i>But he repaid that kindness with murder.</i>

447
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:20,628
<i>Which is why Harlan's World
will remove this terrorist forever.</i>

448
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,093
<i>Sub-level 88.</i>

449
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,933
How much did you give him?

450
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,512
Ortega.

451
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,100
Ortega.

452
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,395
I missed you, Kovacs.

453
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,107
Never call, never write.

454
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,033
Ortega, listen. We're not safe.

455
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,661
We've got to get out of here.

456
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,789
How come I only see you
when you're in trouble, huh?

457
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,168
Oh.

458
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,088
Wow.

459
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,091
You know I never
properly thanked you for my arm.

460
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,093
I really do enjoy it.

461
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,847
So good to see you.

462
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,107
<i>Fabrication complete.</i>
<i>Memory stamp installed.</i>

463
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,364
Hate that thing.

464
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,117
Feels like my brain's being microwaved.

465
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,077
Beats studying a script.

466
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,289
Plus, the hazard pay
for neuromanipulation ain't bad either.

467
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,416
Nothing compared to that bonus.

468
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,667
That upgrade's mine.

469
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,711
We'll see about that.

470
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,643
My whole family died because of you.

471
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,478
Oh!

472
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,741
If we overload the core reactor,
the surge will trigger.

473
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,951
But it's still up to your human
to get out.

474
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,087
I have faith, Miss Dig.

475
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,422
Then let's shut it down.

476
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,640
C'mon, asshole.

477
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,433
My mother.

478
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,894
The children.

479
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,065
Don't tell me he's gonna go out
in this one.

480
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,858
Come on, Kovacs.

481
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,278
We brought the kids back.

482
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:18,658
I gave you the money from Bancroft
to get them new sleeves.

483
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,752
You're not her.

484
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,964
Well, it doesn't matter who I am.

485
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,134
I'm still gonna rip out your spine
and feed it to you.

486
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,428
Oh, there you go. Come on.

487
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,101
Fuck!

488
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,939
No, no, no, no!

489
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,566
- Oh.
- No!

490
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,527
We're experiencing a surge.
I'm rerouting to the city's main grid.

491
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,945
Unfuck this now.

492
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,699
Hang on. I should be able to bypass
the reactor core.

493
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,707
- Damn.
- I told you.

494
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:08,958
Sorry.

495
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,002
What the hell was that?

496
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,753
It's a glitch in the system, sir.

497
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,255
It's under control.

498
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,513
I never wanted to hurt you, Kristin.

499
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,233
I helped you.
It was never enough.

500
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,277
Just take, take, take!

501
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,323
It's no use.

502
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,575
They bypassed the core.

503
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,285
Tied into the main grid.

504
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,205
No, no, no. There must be a way.

505
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,831
I don't think there is.

506
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,756
You never cared about Lizzie.

507
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,299
It was always about you.

508
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,427
Here's my boy.
I think he can take him.

509
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,306
That's all you got?
The Elliot I know hit harder than that.

510
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,892
All right, motherfucker.
Enough of this shit.

511
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,694
Look who's going off book now.

512
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,620
Come on, you Envoy bastard.

513
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,330
You're rooting for the prisoner?

514
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:33,626
I'm rooting for me to be the one
to turn him into a smear on the floor.

515
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,796
You're late.

516
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,590
Got caught on a spot check.

517
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,641
Hey, you'd better hurry.
I hear they saved the best for last.

518
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,775
<i>Fabrication initiated.</i>

519
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,991
<i>Fabrication complete.
Memory stamp installed.</i>

520
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,211
No way this is legal.

521
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,429
This is taking too long. The drug's
wearing off. Send in the next one.

522
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,596
Relax, Colonel.

523
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,975
No one escapes the Circle.
It's impossible.

524
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,113
- Send in the next synth.
- Open the door.

525
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,200
- That isn't the protocol.
- It is if he says so. Do it!

526
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,578
Oh!

527
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,468
Rei?

528
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,803
<i>We always come back for each other.</i>

529
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,722
<i>Family, no matter what.</i>

530
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,143
There's my girl.

531
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,437
- It can't be.
- Who is that?

532
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:20,024
The one demon Mr. Kovacs
will never defeat.

533
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,319
No. He's still mine.

534
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,243
Oh!

535
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,796
Tak.

536
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,464
<i>Come back to me, Tak.</i>

537
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,383
<i>I'm gonna show you how much...</i>

538
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,593
<i>I missed you so much.</i>

539
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:50,346
- You betrayed me, Tak.
<i>- We stick together.</i>

540
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,058
<i>Whenever we face the monsters.</i>

541
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,769
I've been waiting for you.

542
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,106
For such a long time.

543
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,567
We could be together again.

544
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,112
Just you and me.

545
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,366
All you have to do...

546
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,910
is give up!

547
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:17,206
What did I tell you?
Always bet on a family tragedy.

548
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,377
You're right.

549
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:25,756
Everything that happened to you
is my fault.

550
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,136
Do what you have to do.

551
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,115
Danica, you've outdone yourself.

552
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,369
Don't even think about it.

553
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,462
- Did you send in the Falconer synth?
<i>- No, sir, we did not.</i>

554
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,056
Send the Rapid Reaction Force,
all available Praetorians now.

555
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,350
Falconer is confirmed organic.

556
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,560
What did you say?

557
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,856
- Lock it down. No one in or out.
- What's going on?

558
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,733
The impossible.

559
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,112
This is command. We have a breach.

560
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,448
Weapons hot. Tango is organic.

561
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,325
Organic.

562
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,256
Takeshi Kovacs.

563
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,679
You came back.

564
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,824
Long live Quellcrist Falconer.

565
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,542
Shit.

566
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,712
- Did we?
- No.

567
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,164
Fuck.

568
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,838
We got her.

569
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,231
That look organic to you?

570
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:22,576
This was the method Mr. Kovacs used
when processing grief.

571
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:38,926
Does it help?

572
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:42,805
No.

573
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:45,808
Unfortunately.

574
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,439
We may not have been able to cut
the power, but someone else did.

575
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,150
They were surrounded.
The odds of survival...

576
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,569
abysmal.

577
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,405
Even for him.

578
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,661
- He sounds like quite a guy.
- Actually, he was temperamental...

579
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,080
violent.

580
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,250
He berated me constantly.

581
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,841
But...

582
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,093
he never left me behind.

583
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,138
Even in my current state.

584
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,977
He was my only friend.

585
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,189
He doesn't have to be.

586
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,693
Oh, your pity is too much to bear,
Miss Dig.

587
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,572
Mr. Kovacs.

588
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:47,911
You're alive.

589
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,457
My word. Is this...

590
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,041
- Are you...
- We need help.

591
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,210
- Now!
- Follow me.

592
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,467
It's your lucky day.

593
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,845
Turns out someone gives enough of a shit
to pay your way out of here.

594
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:05,846
Hmm.

595
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,557
Next time you go straight
to the Praetorians.

596
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,441
- Hey, babe.
- Don't.

597
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,992
How much?

598
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,952
Enough to clean out our savings.

599
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,371
We're not gonna make our next payment.

600
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,416
I don't know what you were thinking.
You're never this sloppy.

601
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,710
- I was tracking a lead on Anil.
- Of course you were.

602
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,213
- It's become an obsession.
- He is my brother.

603
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,589
I need to know!

604
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,634
This isn't the first time
that he's run off.

605
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,719
He does this. He'll be back.

606
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,262
This time feels different.

607
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,432
That's what I'm worried about.

608
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,144
I'm afraid that you're gonna
take this too far

609
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,355
- and you won't come back.
- Hey!

610
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,024
What are we gonna do?

611
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,119
I'll take care of it.

612
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,811
If you have something to say, Colonel...

613
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,105
say it.

614
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,651
Chatter on the Array has increased.

615
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:46,989
Quellists are taking the Last Envoy's
escape as a call to action.

616
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,827
It's only a matter of time before people
realize Falconer wasn't a synth.

617
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,912
So stop them before it happens.

618
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,539
Use the bio-marker.

619
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,042
Kovacs will disable the marker
now that he knows about it.

620
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,671
Are you saying you can't find them?

621
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:03,922
I can.

622
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,049
With the right resources.

623
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,217
Whatever you need,

624
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,261
whatever it costs...

625
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,515
cut out their stacks and bring them to me.

626
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,645
I won the bet, Governor.

627
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,400
Next time I see you,
you'll need to pay up.

628
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,038
- Activate Evergreen.
- Sir?

629
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,957
- Did you really get clearance?
- Batu, I gave you an order.

630
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,418
I'll take care of it, sir.

631
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,408
I should have known you'd find me.

632
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:15,911
You know me?

633
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,331
Of course I do.

634
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,752
You're the woman who saved me.

635
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,128
Again.

636
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,005
I had to.

637
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,342
I needed to know.

638
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,016
It's me, Quell.

639
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,018
I'm here.

640
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,315
Quell.

641
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:48,652
Is that my name?

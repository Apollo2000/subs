My apologies if your drink disappoints.

27
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,457
It's not you. The nerve endings
in this thing are for shit.

28
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,416
Ah!

29
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,169
- You're wearing a synth.
- More like a latex glove.

30
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,255
Everything tastes
like curried sawdust.

31
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,009
Hmm. Perhaps an organic sleeve
would be more to your liking?

32
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,346
Uh-uh. I'm traveling. Interstellar.

33
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:27,225
May I ask what brings you
all the way to Maghda Prime?

34
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,770
I'm looking for someone.

35
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,481
Takeshi Kovacs?

36
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,857
I beg your pardon.

37
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,945
Word is he's owed a lot of credits
and he'll be here tonight to collect.

38
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,864
Any idea which one of these losers is him?

39
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,662
Hmm. I wish I could be of service,

40
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,749
but I hear Takeshi Kovacs
is off on an epic quest

41
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,043
to find his long-lost love,
Quellcrist Falconer.

42
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,551
Oh, sounds like a load
of swamp-panther crap to me.

43
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,469
I assure you, it is not.

44
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:08,975
You expect me to buy that Takeshi Kovacs,
the Last Envoy, and Quellcrist Falconer,

45
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,102
leader of the Uprising,

46
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,980
had a thing?

47
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,275
If you mean a passionate connection
transcending time

48
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,862
and challenging the grim bounds
of death itself,

49
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,198
then yes, they had a <i>thing.</i>

50
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,411
I never heard that.

51
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,081
Sounds like you know a lot about him.

52
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,001
Oh, I consider myself somewhat
of an authority on the subject.

53
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,336
Prove it.

54
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,588
Untraceable credits.

55
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,882
I've got more...

56
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,427
if you can point him out...

57
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,138
Uh...

58
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,812
Point out who?

59
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,314
I just told you.

60
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,941
I regret, a vicious attack
on my person-hood

61
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,486
has left my memory a trifle...

62
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,196
unreliable?

63
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,782
Perhaps, if you reminded me.

64
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,785
What's your name again?

65
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,620
Hey!

66
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,831
I work here, you don't.
Stop harassing the customers.

67
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,249
Hmm.

68
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,959
Ugh, fucking rogue AI.

69
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,045
You see an emitter around here?

70
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,005
An emitter?

71
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,050
He's a holo.
Talks people's ears off.

72
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,677
He's got stories from all over
the settled worlds.

73
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,262
You think any of them are true?

74
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,515
I think if I ever find
that emitter he's tethered to,

75
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,058
I'm gonna use it for target practice.

76
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,655

Do you know him?

80
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,049
People don't like questions around here.

93
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,134

You all work it out.

00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,267
Partner.

103
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,518
Kovacs?

104
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,564
- Is that you?
- In the flesh.

105
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,857
Just not the kind
you were expecting.

106
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,068
Why didn't you say something
before it all went to shit?

107
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,319
Your money's back in the bar.

108
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,155
My money's in your pocket.

109
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:37,618
You palmed it and left those suckers
to kill each other over an empty case.

110
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,500
Okay.

111
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,169
Maybe not completely empty.

112
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,464
- Yeah.
- Missed me.

113
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,093
All right, all right. Here.

114
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,305
Take it.

115
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:04,979
This is half of what you owe me.
How am I supposed to get off planet?

116
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,148
Look, there's another job.

117
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,066
You could have my cut.

118
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,573
Relax.

119
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,783
Just the messenger.

120
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,495
I was hired to find you.

121
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,289
How the fuck did you?

122
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:28,628
For starters, that's a wide-frequency
emitter you got there on your hip.

123
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,382
I hear Takeshi Kovacs goes nowhere
without his crazy AI.

124
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,718
Yeah, well, I don't like
being interrupted either.

125
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,762
It's not like you were gonna say yes.

126
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,639
And I'm on a deadline.

127
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,725
Horace Axley wants to talk to you.

128
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,393
Meth.

129
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,812
It's a job offer.

130
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,397
Short term.

131
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,775
I don't work for Meths.

132
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,777
You have before.

133
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,363
Tell your boss, hard pass.

134
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,200
I don't care how many credits he's got.

135
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,494
Forget it.

136
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:03,788
Okay.

137
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,922
Told you. I'm on a deadline.

138
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,847
You wanted to get off planet.

139
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,726
You shot me in the back.

140
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,978
Organic damage isn't personal.

141
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,522
It's business.

142
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,109
Honor gets in the way of profit.

143
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,993
Let me guess.

144
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,329
You're Axley?

145
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,500
Have you ever heard of an ONI?
Because you could have done your research.

146
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,129
I fucking hate getting shot.

147
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,631
Well, I wasn't sure you'd take my call.

148
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,676
I hate Meths too.

149
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,054
Well, perhaps this will assuage you.

150
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,655
Accept my offer and this is the sleeve
you'll have waiting for you.

151
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,826
Bespoke design by Khumalo Bioware.

152
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,203
Military use only, aftermarket upgrades,

153
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,290
rapid healing, enhanced reaction time,

154
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:33,669
biometric mag plates among other bells
and whistles. Does it help you say yes?

155
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,881
Does your definition of consent
always involve restraints?

156
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,426
That wasn't my call. My associates set up
this virtual sub routine.

157
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,969
You mean, your bounty hunter.

158
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,972
She's done quite a few jobs for me.
She's efficient.

159
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,515
She's a psychopath.

160
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,809
Well, coming from you,
I'll assume that's a compliment.

161
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,228
I'll adjust it.

162
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,146
Don't bother.

163
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,274
Envoy 101: I control the construct.

164
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,239
You know what I hate more than Meths

165
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,866
or death by gunfire?

166
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,118
It's being underestimated.

167
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,999
This room isn't real.
Your stacks in conducting gel.

168
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,335
You're not getting out of that body
without me.

169
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,712
One minute.

170
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,548
If you're still not interested,
I'll cast you back to Maghda Prime

171
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,718
in whatever lounge performer sleeve
you want.

172
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,013
It better be good.
I always wanted to play piano.

173
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,311
I need your protection.

174
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,479
From what?

175
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,148
There's a war where I come from.

176
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,859
Get private security or go on vacation.
Or move.

177
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,861
I have business interests I can't forsake.

178
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,072
I believe no one can protect me
better than you.

179
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,533
- I don't care.
- I can give you what you want.

180
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,077
No matter what you have,
it won't be enough.

181
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,037
Quellcrist Falconer.

182
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,962
Be very careful what you say next.

183
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,672
I can show you where she is,

184
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,924
and I'll pay you enough the two of you
can disappear.

185
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,133
I don't believe you.

186
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,677
You'll see for yourself.

187
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,846
I can deliver her.

188
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,765
How? How do you know it's really her?

189
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,475
Do you have her DHF?

190
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,394
Is she spun up, re-sleeved?

191
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,020
Where the fuck did you find her?

192
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,314
I'll answer all your questions
when you're here.

193
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,608
As long as you keep me alive.

194
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,611
Falconer's life for mine.

195
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,613
Do I have your word?

196
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,868
If you're lying,

197
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,496
you have my word
the last thing you'll see is this face

198
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,708
before your stack is ripped
from your spine.

199
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:43,382
I crossed the stars in a colony ship
before stacks were invented.

200
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,844
I left a dying Earth behind
to seed a new world.

201
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,722
You don't scare me, Mr. Kovacs.

202
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,309
I know what you dream of.

203
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,902
Make sure there's a mirror.

204
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:09,325
And get your psychopath bounty hunter
to transmit my AI.

205
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:11,952
Already done.

206
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,508
<i>Stay alive long enough,</i>

207
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,930
<i>and there's nowhere you can go
that isn't haunted.</i>

208
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,141
<i>I see the boy inside the man.</i>

209
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,605
<i>All of us have ghosts.</i>

210
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,904
<i>They cling to us like shadows.</i>

211
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,993
<i>But if you chase after shadows...</i>

212
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,332
<i>if you're foolish enough to seek out
your ghosts...</i>

213
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,167
<i>Survive. That's an order!</i>

214
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,086
<i>...you just might become one.</i>

215
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,462
Tak.

216
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,995
<i>Thank you for choosing</i>
<i>Psychosec in-home resleeving package,</i>

217
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,372
<i>the ultimate in elegance and privacy.</i>

218
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,547
Mirror.

219
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:51,427
<i>My readings show that you</i>
<i>may be feeling some sleeve sickness.</i>

220
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,514
<i>I've alerted support staff.
Medication is on the way.</i>

221
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,440
<i>I recommend you lie down and relax.</i>

222
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,858
<i>Your oxygen levels are low.</i>

223
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,251
Wha...

224
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,586
Ah.

225
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:34,720
Ah...

226
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,984
<i>Your resleeving is now complete.</i>

227
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,045
Axley.

228
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,923
Shit, Axley.

229
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,092
Wake up. Axley, where is she?

230
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,052
Gone.

231
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,011
Tell me!

232
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:19,848
Axley.

233
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,090
Fuck.

234
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,478
You seeing this?

235
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,940
"'Twas noontide of summer

236
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:14,444
And mid-time of night,
And stars in their orbits

237
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:18,073
Shone pale thro' the night."

238
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,618
Yeah, but those aren't stars.

239
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,040
Angelfire.

240
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,377
Obviously we're on...

241
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,590
Harlan's World?

242
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,676
You know another planet
with a sky full of Elder Orbitals?

243
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,181
Home again, home again. Huzzah.

244
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,852
- How long has it been? Five years?
- Try 30.

245
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,355
Of all the godforsaken rocks
we've been to,

246
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,399
we're right back where we started.

247
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,360
I thought you swore you'd never return.
What compelled you?

248
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,404
Horace Axley compelled me.

249
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,532
And who, pray tell, is Horace Axley?

250
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,826
He's that one.

251
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,830
My word.

252
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,459
- We just got here.
- I didn't kill him.

253
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,586
What a refreshing change. Hmm.

254
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,590
Is it prudent to loiter?

255
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,593
We're in a house with a murdered Meth.
Whatever happened, I'll be blamed.

256
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:23,263
Now Axley said this sleeve
has a personalized weapons augment.

257
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,308
Just have to be within range.

258
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,688
Oh, my.

259
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,607
Let's go.

260
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,687
Look, the needlecast station.
It's a sign. We should heed it.

261
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,815
Not until I find out who killed Axley.

262
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,985
We have no idea what Mr. Axley
will remember after he spins back up.

263
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,487
And as you said, so astutely,

264
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,991
accusations for his murder
could land squarely on you.

265
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,325
If we are apprehended,

266
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,620
you will be arrested,
and I will be deleted.

267
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,497
- Choosing to stay here is...
- It's not a choice.

268
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,832
...self-destructive.

269
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,293
- Suicide!
- I'm not leaving.

270
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,920
You don't get it. Axley was a Meth.

271
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,172
He should have been untouchable
with his resources,

272
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,799
but he was scared shitless.

273
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,635
He believed he needed protection.
And he was right.

274
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,512
If he was right about that...

275
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,807
he might be right about Quell.

276
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,769
Quell?

277
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,938
He said she's here.

278
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,899
He swore to prove it if I kept him alive.

279
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,194
I see. If that is the case...

280
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,281
we'll need some place to stay.

281
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,117
I know a place.

282
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,412
An old AI hotel a friend of mine
used to own.

283
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,166
<i>There has also been</i>
<i>a decrease in terrorist activity</i>

284
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,168
<i>within the city of Millsport itself.</i>

285
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,588
<i>Negotiations with Joshua Kemp are ongoing</i>

286
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,631
<i>- as we await...</i>
<i>- </i>Check the local feed.

287
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,467
Axley said something about a war.

288
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,595
It appears we've arrived
in the middle of it.

289
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,017
True salvation is found in renunciation.

290
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,188
Become a Renouncer and the world can be
as you make it. No loss, no pain.

291
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,147
No, thank you.

292
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:50,952
Do a search on Konrad Harlan,
see what the old bastard's up to.

293
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,955
<i>Attention, stand by</i>
<i>for an important message</i>

294
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,290
<i>from Governor Harlan.</i>

295
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,167
That's not Konrad.

296
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,254
According to the Array,
Konrad recently abdicated his position,

297
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,715
along with everything else.

298
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,716
You're kidding?

299
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,054
In his absence, his daughter, Danica,
has taken up his mantle.

300
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,848
Let me guess. She ran unopposed.

301
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,350
That is also accurate.

302
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,064
<i>Citizens of Harlan's World,</i>

303
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:23,693
<i>for 20 years the Quellist rebellion
has disrupted our way of life.</i>

304
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,904
<i>Mines have been sabotaged,</i>

305
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:29,699
<i>alloy shipments attacked,
our people dislocated.</i>

306
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,911
<i>At every step, we have fought back
against these terrorists,</i>

307
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,290
<i>weakening them,
rooting them out of our cities.</i>

308
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,253
But we have also suffered great loss.

309
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,630
It's with this shared burden in mind

310
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:48,218
<i>that I have recently entered into talks
with Quellist leader Joshua Kemp.</i>

311
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,808
It would seem the revolution
has a new face as well.

312
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,269
I've seen enough.

313
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,105
<i> After much negotiation,</i>

314
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:04,276
we have agreed this conflict must end.

315
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:08,196
<i>A cease-fire is now in place
effective immediately.</i>

316
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,286
<i>Starting tomorrow,</i>
<i>mining operations resume in full.</i>

317
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:20,292
<i>Make no mistake, if the cease-fire
is broken, our retaliation will be swift.</i>

318
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,962
But tonight, as your governor

319
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,423
and as my father's daughter,

320
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:31,678
<i>I am proud to declare the safety
of Harlan's World has been secured.</i>

321
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,474
Thank you. Good night.

322
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,774
Congratulations.

323
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,776
You've brought peace to the world.

324
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:53,158
My father used to say that a cease-fire
was just a breath between battles.

325
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,327
A breath's all we need.

326
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,996
The Protectorate will have to return
their colonel now.

327
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,290
No war, no reason to stay.

328
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,878
Over half the stacks in existence
are made of alloy dug from our trenches.

329
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,297
We're the goddamn fountain
of eternal life, Stone.

330
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,842
Colonel Carrera has every reason to stay.

331
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:15,889
The only thing standing between
the Protectorate and us is them.

332
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,935
Well, I think you're giving <i>them</i>
too much credit.

333
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,270
Elders are extinct.

334
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,399
Anyone who builds weaponized satellites
we can't shoot down

335
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,401
deserves to be taken seriously.

336
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,195
And did your father say that too?

337
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,572
Quellcrist Falconer actually.

338
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,576
Keep an eye on Colonel Carrera.

339
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,330
Let's make sure he doesn't come up
with another reason to stay.

340
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,175
I believe we made a wrong turn.

341
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,178
The Array has no evidence
of a decommissioned hotel in this area.

342
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,056
Well, the guy who owns it
pays a lot of money to keep it that way.

343
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:01,142
Hmm.
One of your more unsavory acquaintances?

344
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,186
Depends where you stand on Yakuza.

345
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:04,771
Yakuza?

346
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:08,567
The big boss has a dozen of these places,
half safe house, half black site.

347
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,443
I've used it before so he won't...

348
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,153
Damn it, Poe.

349
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,074
- You glitched.
- Ah!

350
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,867
There you are.

351
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,079
- Try and stick with me, okay?
- Of course.

352
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,833
- Where are we going again?
- I just told you, twice.

353
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:25,750
Oh.

354
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,961
Are we there yet?

355
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:30,714
We're here.

356
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,848
And are you certain it is safe?

357
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,644
- You're under arrest for treason.
- Good to see you too, Jaeger.

358
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,232
Safe enough.

359
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,110
If you'll excuse me, I will leave you

360
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,779
to adjust the configuration
of the nanoswarm.

361
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,098
[man 1 speaking Japanese}

362
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,942
Trespassers!

363
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,111
I did not sanction this.
This building is off-limits.

364
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,907
Who the hell do you think you are?

365
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,534
You got a death wish?

366
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,540
Answer me.

367
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,086
I am Tanaseda Hideki. This is my property.

368
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,340
Tanaseda wouldn't be caught dead
in a common combat sleeve.

369
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,219
Arrows and bullets all spent...

370
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,471
with sadness we fall.

371
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,307
But unless I smite the enemy,

372
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,809
my body cannot rot in the field.

373
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,311
Where did you hear that?

374
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,023
I told you, I'm Tanaseda Hideki.

375
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,944
Continue this disrespect,
whoever you may be...

376
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,989
and I will rip you from that sleeve.

377
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,620
Almost had me.

378
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,957
Only one mistake.

379
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,877
I'm Tanaseda Yukito.

380
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,215
You don't recognize
your own great-grandson?

381
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,594
<i>Ojiichan?</i>

382
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,057
Now that you mention it,
you do look familiar.

383
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,311
That sleeve
is worth a bundle, Yuki-<i>san.</i>

384
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,566
That's some custom shit.

385
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,447
Preserve the sleeve.

386
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,906
Sir, I set up a nanoswarm,

387
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:07,036
so if you would be so kind
as to plug in the emitter,

388
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,582
perhaps I can assist in negotiating
this misunderstanding.

389
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,125
Perhaps not.

390
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,339
Nothing common about that.

391
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,172
You're a dead man.

392
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,471
But first, you get to explain
to my great-grandfather

393
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,390
why you know my family's death poem.

394
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,600
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

395
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,996
So this is the man
who dares take my name.

396
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,755
A heavy burden...

397
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,302
not worth stealing and harder to carry.

398
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,387
My name carries its own weight.

399
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,267
He impersonated you, <i>Sosofu.</i>
Sleeve killed two of my men.

400
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,603
How do you know
my family's death poem?

401
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:40,189
You recited it to me almost 300 years ago

402
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,527
in a teahouse in New Hokkaido.

403
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,239
Foolish child.

404
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:52,785
Do you have any idea who you escorted
past my security?

405
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,122
Perhaps you'd like to cut out my stack
and hand it to him as well.

406
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,957
No, we beat him.

407
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,460
He's not a threat.

408
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,129
Educate him.

409
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,770
Forgive me, <i>Oyabun.</i>

410
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,940
I asked you
to make a point, and you made it.

411
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,274
I don't understand.

412
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,277
He's an Envoy.

413
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,739
He allowed you to beat him
because he wanted an audience.

414
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,408
He recited the poem
so you would have to comply.

415
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:35,453
Isn't that right, Takeshi-<i>san?</i>

416
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,668
I'm not here to endanger you,
only to ask a favor.

417
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,711
I need a place to stay.

418
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,421
Off the grid.

419
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,715
But my great-grandson didn't know that.

420
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,176
I'll make amends.

421
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,178
Start by vacating the building.

422
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:59,060
This man did a job for me
after the fall of Stronghold.

423
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,230
When one of our own betrayed me,

424
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:07,110
he was caught by the Protectorate,
tortured in every way they knew how.

425
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,362
He never gave me up.

426
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,658
He is not to be bothered again!

427
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:28,381
Yukito is young,
but still, that was disappointing.

428
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,259
Family usually is.

429
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,556
I see your gift for understatement
hasn't changed.

430
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,933
Has anything else?

431
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,228
I'm still looking for her.

432
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:47,275
Horace Axley told me that she was here
on Harlan's, said he could prove it.

433
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,943
I protected him...

434
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:50,987
but I was too late.

435
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,284
Axley and I go back a long way,
Takeshi-<i>san.</i>

436
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,038
He would lie to the devil himself
if he stood something to gain.

437
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,833
Well, someone went savage on him.
This time he wasn't lying.

438
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,879
I gave no orders to eliminate Axley.

439
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,757
The last time you were here,

440
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:17,179
you suspected your sister had hidden
Quellcrist Falconer's DHF.

441
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,726
Has it ever occurred to you
that Reileen was lying?

442
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:26,731
That Axley merely dangled Falconer's
whereabouts to bend you to his will?

443
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:28,483
Every minute of every day.

444
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:33,029
But if there's a chance that anything
he said is true...

445
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,447
I can't walk away.

446
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,867
That's not love.

447
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,827
It's obsession.

448
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,422
This is the first Songspire grown
in captivity,

449
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,384
my personal experiment over the centuries.

450
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,513
You sound like a scientist.

451
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,891
Remnants of an abandoned past.

452
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:06,312
The cells in our bodies are constantly
dying and being replaced.

453
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,816
As we age, we become a copy
of a copy of a copy,

454
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,734
degrading each time.

455
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,488
Meths have got around that.

456
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,323
Have we?

457
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:22,620
We transfer our minds into new sleeves,

458
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,165
but what if the spirit degrades as well?

459
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,627
We can't quantify the change,
but we are not the same.

460
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,880
I'm not the person I once was.

461
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,134
Neither are you.

462
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,097
Nor, I suspect, is she.

463
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,062
I didn't come here for a lesson, <i>Oyabun.</i>

464
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,235
I should get back.

465
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,333
<i>Time is the greatest of all warriors.</i>

466
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,378
<i>What it doesn't destroy,</i>

467
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,965
<i>it alters beyond recognition.</i>

468
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,553
<i>Time tears down everything.</i>

469
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,891
<i>We brace our backs against the void,</i>

470
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:28,603
<i>desperate to hold on to the past...</i>

471
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,690
<i>to our ghosts...</i>

472
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,694
<i>to ourselves.</i>

473
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,218
Ah.

474
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,428
My apologies, sir.

475
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,890
I'm afraid our old haunt
is much like myself,

476
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,893
in a state of broken-down disarray.

477
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:07,243
Perhaps "The Nevermore"
would be a more apt moniker.

478
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:09,870
Is there whiskey?

479
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:17,670
I believe the former tenants
left a passable bottle of...

480
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,799
Oh! Single malt.

481
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:22,925
Then it's fine.

482
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,637
All I want is a bed
and no more bullshit for one day.

483
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:32,685
Hmm, can I infer you... triumphed
against adversity once again?

484
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,187
I'm on a planet I hate,

485
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,983
I don't know who killed Axley
or how I'll find them,

486
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,986
and I'm no closer to Quell
than I was before.

487
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,572
So...

488
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,033
that's a no.

489
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,785
Good night, Poe.

490
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,547
Good night, sir.

491
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,572
I can't do this anymore.

492
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:33,287
This wild-goose chase across the stars,
running after you.

493
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,335
This isn't true, is it?

494
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,422
You're just a figment...

495
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,633
in my head.

496
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,011
That's all there is left.

497
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,098
You're gone.

498
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,768
You have your answer, Tak.

499
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,063
- It's in the one place you're not looking.
- I don't know what that means.

500
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:02,525
When we made stacks, we thought
we severed the mind from the body,

501
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,318
but the truth is more complicated.

502
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,822
I'm done with complicated.
Either you're dead or you're not.

503
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,201
Our bodies know things,

504
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,453
our skin, our bones,

505
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,373
our flesh hold our experiences.

506
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:22,503
What does your body, this body, remember?

507
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,342
Feel what you felt...

508
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,178
then you can remember what you saw.

509
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,267
State-dependent memory.

510
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,153
Quell!

511
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,992
I did what you told me.

512
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,412
I survived.

513
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,249
I'm not here for you.

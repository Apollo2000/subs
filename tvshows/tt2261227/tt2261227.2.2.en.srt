1
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,923
‫- Sir, you can't go up there.
‫- Step aside.

2
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,560
Capillaries burst.

3
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,562
The guy's stack is swimming in blood.

4
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,397
What the fuck?

5
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,402
Hold... hold on. Hold it!
This is an active crime scene.

6
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:13,406
Detective Lorcan, Colonel Carrera,
Protector of Special Forces.

7
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,867
We intercepted your initial report.

8
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,912
My unit will take over this investigation.

9
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:19,996
On what grounds?

10
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,791
I mean, this is a civilian murder case.

11
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,459
You're the Wedge.

12
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,923
If it were up to me, I'd stay out
of your way, but I've got orders. So, um,

13
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,051
why not show me the tank,
and we can get this over with.

14
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,552
Fine.

15
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,097
But no weapons.

16
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,267
You heard the man.

17
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,545
Looks like your suspect
had a hard time re-sleeving.

18
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,965
You download the transfer data?

19
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,092
We're not amateurs, Colonel.

20
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,722
Based on our estimated timeline,
whoever cast in

21
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,142
showed up just before the killing started.

22
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,564
Any weapons recovered on site?

23
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:32,026
Nothing that wasn't registered
to Axley or his security.

24
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,238
What about your team?

25
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,533
They know what happened
to Axley's backups?

26
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,994
I don't keep secrets from my team.

27
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,412
Mm-hmm.

28
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,749
So...

29
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,003
who do you think cast into the sleeve,
Detective?

30
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,464
You were first on the scene.
I'm sure you have some insight.

31
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,591
Ah.

32
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,512
Well, judging from the organic damage,
I'm thinking military.

33
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,183
Some PTSD headcase fragged from the war.

34
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,935
Or one too many skulljumps.

35
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,354
You've a low opinion of those who serve.

36
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,023
It's just a theory.

37
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,526
Rich guys like Axley like to hire vets
as bodyguards.

38
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,070
I take it
you've never been in the military?

39
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,864
What? And risk my stack?

40
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,575
So Danica Harlan
can make an extra two percent

41
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,785
pushing alloy past Kemp's blockades?

42
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,373
The, uh, sleeve our perp cast into,
now that thing is a freak show.

43
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,713
That's mil-spec.

44
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,506
Unregistered.

45
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,424
Well...

46
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:41,179
whoever designed it
was into some fucked up gene splicing.

47
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,181
They cut in canine DNA.

48
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,475
The killer's part dog.

49
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,435
You sure it wasn't wolf?

50
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,687
Wolf? Dog? What's the difference?

51
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,940
Start messing with your genome like that,

52
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,359
next thing you know,
you got a snout and four legs.

53
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,071
Guess Axley should've used
a shorter leash.

54
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,908
You know what, Detective?

55
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,493
I've seen enough.

56
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,750
So, Colonel...

57
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,212
what are you thinking?

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,757
Here is my considered opinion.

59
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:23,054
If you kick a dog, it'll crawl back,
lick your foot,

60
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,473
begging for forgiveness.

61
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,858
Kick a wolf...

62
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,868
and he'll rip your face off.

63
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:38,838
Pack up.

64
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,140
Are we having a fete?

65
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:54,312
More of a wake, but still a toast.

66
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,648
Here's to 30 years...

67
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,153
42 planets...

68
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,949
countless sleeves...

69
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,996
and I don't know how many credits.

70
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,209
Fifty-one million
three hundred thirty-two thousand.

71
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,090
After all that, I get five words:

72
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,841
"I'm not here for you."

73
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,095
Well, technically speaking,
Miss Falconer was not there for you.

74
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,888
She was there to kill Mr. Axley.

75
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,016
And I'm just a naked stranger
who got in the way?

76
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,019
Could explain the extreme violence.

77
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,855
Yeah, but it doesn't explain
why she was there to begin with,

78
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,607
or how Axley knew she was coming.

79
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,152
May I suggest temperance?

80
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,614
Your sorrows may be infinite,
but the supply of whiskey is not.

81
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,866
And just as well.

82
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,578
This sleeve seems to have
some metabolic filter.

83
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,665
Run a scan and see
what other modifications Axley made.

84
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,251
I'm sick of surprises.

85
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,087
A full analysis will take quite some time.

86
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,297
What, pray tell, is your plan?

87
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,634
Drink fast enough to try and override
the tolerance settings.

88
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,139
I meant your plan to locate Miss Falconer.

89
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,517
She doesn't wanna be found.

90
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,311
At least not by me.

91
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,564
As dispiriting as this may be,

92
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,524
perhaps you should consider
the alternative.

93
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,610
That the woman you crossed
is not, in fact, her.

94
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,155
- That someone else is riding her sleeve.
- Yeah, but...

95
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,409
on Harlan's World,
it's illegal to replicate her sleeve.

96
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,827
- Mm-hmm.
- Why risk it?

97
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,246
Fear.

98
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,082
A murderer terrorizing Axley.

99
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,169
Hmm? Becoming a ghost of retribution.

100
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,837
I wasn't acclimated.

101
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,424
She could have killed me
just like everyone else, but she didn't.

102
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,843
It doesn't make sense unless...

103
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,311
...she knew me.

104
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,484
The only way to know for sure
is to find Miss Falconer.

105
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,987
Or the dastardly sleeve-jacker
who's inhabiting her form.

106
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,655
Axley knew something.

107
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,868
Hack the police files.
See if he's reappeared.

108
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,872
According to the report,
Mr. Axley suffered organic damage

109
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,957
and is recuperating on Latimer
in a new clone.

110
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,877
Well, that leaves me nowhere.

111
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,882
Hmm, if only you knew someone
who worked for Mr. Axley.

112
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:34,804
Someone who could provide insight
into his affairs.

113
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,392
What do you mean, the bounty hunter?
The one who shot me in the back?

114
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,602
In her defense, she is hardly the first.

115
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,232
Yeah, but I don't even know her name.
I can't just go around asking.

116
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,491
Pull up all open bounties on planet.

117
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,662
Everyone who has a price on their head.

118
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,752
Last time we were here was less than 100.

119
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:08,881
Most of these are civilians, refugees,
some soldiers who've gone missing.

120
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,218
Lost souls, if you will.

121
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,303
Narrow it down.

122
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,972
Violent offenders only.

123
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,058
Isolate the subjects
with the highest reward.

124
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,185
Axley's assets have been frozen,

125
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,940
so my guess is our little bounty hunter
is gonna try and make up those credits.

126
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,858
Credits...

127
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,075
No!

128
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,037
My apologies.

129
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,874
There seems to be some disruptions
in my neural net.

130
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,209
It's more than that.

131
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,003
Your processor is corrupted.

132
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,839
It has been since Leung attacked
in Bay City.

133
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:50,840
Quite aware.

134
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,425
It's getting worse.

135
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,552
You need to reboot.

136
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,053
It's not that simple.

137
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,307
I'd have to completely shut down.
There's no telling how long I'd be out.

138
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,183
A day, a week, a month?

139
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,729
You cannot be without backup
in this crucial time!

140
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,980
It's not about me!

141
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,189
It's about her.

142
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,609
You're afraid your gonna forget Lizzie.

143
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:10,943
It is...

144
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:17,992
It is quite possible that in rebuilding
my operating system, my...

145
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,787
recollections of Miss Elizabeth...

146
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,374
would be wiped clean.

147
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:32,840
All my recollections of you
and our wild-goose chase across the stars.

148
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:38,095
All the sum total of all my experiences.

149
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,767
Surely you can understand my reluctance.

150
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,146
I can't rely on you if you keep glitching.

151
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,398
You have to let go.

152
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,109
Like you've let go of Miss Falconer?

153
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,821
You're putting us both at risk.

154
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,575
I reboot, there won't be a me
to risk losing.

155
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,122
So...

156
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,752
if you will allow me to perform
a manual override...

157
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,713
I believe this is what you're looking for.

158
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,592
Highest bounties on planet
are these five unsavory characters.

159
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,554
Upload them to my ONI.

160
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,433
And when you've finished the scan
of my sleeve, let me know what you find.

161
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,601
Mm-hmm.

162
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,062
This isn't over.

163
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,480
Oh, I assure you.

164
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,190
Measures will be taken.

165
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,733
Good.

166
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,360
In the meantime...

167
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,613
I'm going bounty-hunting.

168
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,955
The first alloy shipments
went out on schedule.

169
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,040
No disturbance from Kemp or his rebels.

170
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,375
And the Protectorate?

171
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,837
Already demanding we double
our protection as expected.

172
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,047
We'll cross that bridge when we have to.

173
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,216
As far as the mines are concerned...

174
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,637
Colonel Carrera.

175
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,681
This is a surprise.

176
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,561
I thought you'd be gone by now.

177
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,771
I told you the ceasefire
wouldn't hold, Governor.

178
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,314
Looks like I was right.

179
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,442
I have no idea what the hell
you're talking about.

180
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,402
Horace Axley does.

181
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,156
Unfortunately, he's not here to elaborate.

182
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,449
That's because he's dead.

183
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,910
An intruder cast into his home last night
and killed him.

184
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,538
That is alarming.
Then again, it's no secret

185
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,332
that Axley
has his fair share of enemies.

186
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,294
We'll ask him which one it was
when he spins back up.

187
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,045
He's not spinning back up.

188
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:39,925
His stack was wiped completely
along with all of his remote backups.

189
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,762
- Axley was real-deathed.
- That's not possible.

190
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,390
The Quellists are a terrorist death cult.

191
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:51,729
They've wanted to curtail the human
life span since the days of Falconer.

192
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,482
Whatever weapon was used to kill Axley,

193
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,026
I'm sure their fingerprints
are all over it.

194
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,360
We cannot let this get out.

195
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,654
- If people think we're vulnerable...
- Don't worry.

196
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,073
I locked it all the way down.

197
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,659
Scrubbed their reports,
took care of the witnesses.

198
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,121
Your reputations are safe.

199
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,873
But they are not my concern.

200
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,416
What is your concern?

201
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,669
You have no proof
the Quellists are involved.

202
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,923
You were sent here
to manage the war effort.

203
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,759
And as much as you'd like
to find a reason to stay,

204
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,261
a Meth's murder is my jurisdiction.

205
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,387
You're wrong, Governor.

206
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,602
The killer's DHF was downloaded
into a Wedge sleeve,

207
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,231
a model designed exclusively for me
and my team.

208
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,567
The stolen Protectorate asset
of that magnitude

209
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,611
makes it my jurisdiction.

210
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,988
I am here until it's recovered.

211
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,907
Well, that shouldn't take long.

212
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,952
We all know how the Protectorate
loves to tag their toys.

213
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,912
We can track the sleeve's biometrics.

214
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,622
By all means, track away.

215
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,377
But I have no doubt you'll find
whoever did this was acting alone.

216
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,381
The people of Harlan's World
are committed to peace.

217
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,802
It's foolish to think you can make peace
with terrorists.

218
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,138
You should have crushed the Quellists
instead of cowing to them.

219
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,474
Your father understood that.

220
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,268
I am not my father.

221
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,936
And we're all worse off for that.

222
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:19,900
Find the Meth killer, Colonel.
And then get the fuck off my planet.

223
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,280
It's the Protectorate's planet, Governor.

224
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,324
They all are.

225
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,757
Ho, Gertie.

226
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,803
Got a question.

227
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,054
No questions.

228
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,141
- Come on, G.
- You wanna know who I buy from.

229
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,434
I buy from everyone.

230
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,774
You are moving a lot of gear.

231
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:04,194
Hey, watch it. I don't want those coils
of yours setting off my machinery.

232
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,616
You seen Raab lately?

233
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,492
Uh, no.

234
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,744
Why do you ask?

235
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,914
'Cause he usually comes in
after a hack-and-grab.

236
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,708
Emphasis on the hack.

237
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,044
No, no, I haven't seen him, no.

238
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,589
I've been looking for you.

239
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,843
You shoot me twice in two days,

240
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,637
I will hold a grudge.

241
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,556
Kovacs?

242
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,475
You catch on fast.

243
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,479
Who are you waiting for? Raab?

244
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,980
What the hell do you know about it?

245
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,238
I got something for ya.

246
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,410
Do me a favor,
stay the hell out of my way.

247
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,418
That still have scalp on it?

248
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,173
Trepp.

249
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,716
Been a while.

250
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,677
You broke the code, Raab.

251
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,429
So you got a partner now?

252
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,599
You're supposed to salvage war wreckage,

253
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,935
not other Decoms in the field.

254
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,398
The Guild is offering lots of zeros
to haul your ass in.

255
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,983
Got a preference?

256
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,317
Sleeve or stack?

257
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,986
I suggest sleeve.

258
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,196
How much to walk away now?

259
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,699
That...

260
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,826
is not yours.

261
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,203
Maybe not.

262
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:41,667
But then again,
maybe I'll take your coils.

263
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,878
Make you mine.

264
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,757
I'm not joking.

265
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,092
I'm not her partner.

266
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,972
Goddammit, Kovacs.

267
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,659
Relax. I'm just gonna take a little
off the top.

268
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:19,204
Hey!

269
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,671
Wait, I choose sleeve.

270
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,799
- No. Deal's off the table.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

271
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,637
You good?

272
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,349
You show up just to fuck
with my income stream or what?

273
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,270
Who's gonna pay for all this?

274
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,439
Take their gear. Keep the change.

275
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,778
What the hell was that?

276
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,073
- Raab's stack was my bounty.
- Yeah, speaking of bounties,

277
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,867
here are the five highest-valued bounties
on the board.

278
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,829
Bullshit, you went through all five
just to find me?

279
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,289
Process of elimination.

280
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,749
So what's it gonna be?

281
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,167
Are we gonna talk?

282
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,212
Or am I dropping a fistful of scumbags
down the drain?

283
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,757
Shit. Not here.

284
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,217
Let's go.

285
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,472
This is dangerous territory, Danica.

286
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,517
News of Axley's murder
will find its way out.

287
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,894
- And I don't have to tell you...
- You're right, Dugan.

288
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,229
You don't.

289
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,315
There's nothing to be gained
about disseminating this information.

290
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,400
Or by undermining me.

291
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,277
I'm trying to help you.

292
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,073
Your father relied on me
to tell him the truth.

293
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,034
If Carrera's determined
to stay on this planet,

294
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,911
he's just gonna find another excuse.

295
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:41,954
Then we wait...

296
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,331
till he runs out of excuses.

297
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,333
You're being reckless!

298
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,003
A weapon that can erase remote backups.

299
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,799
Do you understand what could happen

300
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,884
if the Protectorate adds that
to their arsenal?

301
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,470
Your generation doesn't remember
what it was like before stacks.

302
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,597
- Don't.
- The decisions we had to make.

303
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,851
Do not lecture me on consequences.

304
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,729
This isn't about proving yourself, Danica.

305
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,357
Your father knew how to keep
the Protectorate in check.

306
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,443
If you would just consider contacting him.

307
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,783
You wanna contact Konrad?

308
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,952
Go ahead, ONI him.

309
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,038
You've already tried.

310
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,749
We all have.

311
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,921
Since he took his Renouncer vows,
no one can reach him.

312
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,049
He's gone.

313
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,928
I still can't understand it.

314
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,806
He gave up everything so suddenly.

315
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,938
As his oldest friend, I can imagine
your disappointment in his decision.

316
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,568
But I'm his only child.

317
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,905
You can't imagine mine.

318
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,489
You're right.

319
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,617
I'll go.

320
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,911
Dugan.

321
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,541
Carrera is on our planet.

322
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,753
The situation is volatile.

323
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,465
If something were to happen
after he secures the weapon...

324
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,260
who's to say who it belongs to?

325
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,055
What you're talking about,

326
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:27,309
it would shift the balance of power
throughout the settled worlds.

327
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,313
My father's not the only Harlan
capable of making history.

328
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,066
Give me time.

329
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,540
Look, Axley and I weren't exactly friends.

330
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,211
I did a few jobs for him. That's all.

331
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,340
He kept his hands to himself.

332
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,300
Paid his bills on time.

333
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,469
Well, until now.

334
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,805
You aren't worried that I killed him?

335
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,640
Didn't add up.

336
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,060
Axley told me he wanted you
for protection.

337
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,397
- Any idea from who?
- No.

338
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,441
But he must have done something
to piss someone off.

339
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,488
So what did he say when he hired you?

340
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,449
That he wanted the Last Envoy.

341
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,577
No accounting for taste, I guess.

342
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,788
And you didn't ask any questions?

343
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,085
Why would I?
The man was offering to double my rate.

344
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,337
What's it to you anyway?

345
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:41,508
When I found you, you were singing
torch songs on Maghda Prime.

346
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,220
Why not just cash in
that fancy sleeve of yours and cast off?

347
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,642
No one stays on Harlan's without a reason.

348
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,185
What's yours?

349
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,648
I said no interruptions.

350
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,902
Too bad. Crowd out there's thirsty.

351
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,489
And they're actually paying.

352
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,044
Oh, shit. There's trouble in paradise.

353
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,550
Is that the famous Envoy intuition
I've heard so much about?

354
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,427
'Cause you're way off.

355
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,679
Look...

356
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,681
when I showed up at Axley's,

357
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,142
he was on his ONI
with his business partners.

358
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,978
I overheard them talking about extortion.

359
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:39,107
Said some blackmailer was gonna
catch hell for wearing an illegal sleeve.

360
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,110
- Who did they say was blackmailing him?
- They didn't.

361
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,655
But once he hung up, he called me in,

362
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,075
told me I had to track you down
immediately.

363
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,035
So Axley's partners, who are they?

364
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,627
Anton Durov and Haruki Okada.

365
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,713
- Where can I find 'em?
- I'm sure we can figure it out.

366
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,924
- There is no we.
- Not yet.

367
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:08,261
Listen, I have never seen anyone roll
five heavy hitters in one day.

368
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,389
We partner up...

369
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,183
we could set a new record.

370
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,019
Split the payouts 50-50.

371
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,105
I work alone.

372
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,151
No resources and no contacts.

373
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,319
Good luck.

374
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,073
Thanks for the drink.

375
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,300
Uh, bio-tracker, hmm.

376
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,720
You cannot hide your secrets from me.

377
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,391
Mr. Kovacs.

378
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,060
Hmm, back from the hunt.

379
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,854
Was your search fruitful?

380
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,231
I found the bounty hunter,
if that's what you're asking.

381
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,819
Judging by your demeanor,

382
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,738
you uncovered more than you bargained for?

383
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,699
I think you were right
about the sleeve-jacker.

384
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,576
What's this?

385
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:17,456
This is a new external
data retrieval system

386
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,000
I installed to remedy my...

387
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,962
- short-term memory loss. Hmm.
- You're kidding, right?

388
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,590
If you actually look,
you'll see I performed a detailed scan

389
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,175
of your sleeve as requested.

390
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,093
And it appears there is, uh...

391
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,846
There is transgenic splicing. Hmm?

392
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,266
<i>Canis lupus.</i>

393
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,104
And hyper mobility, hmm?

394
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:45,150
- Subconscious survival skills...
- I'll read the footnotes later.

395
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:50,071
Run a search on Axley's associates
Anton Durov and Haruki Okada.

396
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,114
I need everything.

397
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,366
Most importantly, where can I find them?

398
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,913
But it's unlikely a pair of Meths
would post their calendar on the Array.

399
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,499
Well, hack their personal
security systems.

400
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,252
They know why Axley thought Quell
was on planet.

401
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,921
Planet...

402
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:08,798
Wait.

403
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,761
Did you just say, uh...

404
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:18,099
Did you just say Miss Falconer is here?

405
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,601
On this planet?

406
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,685
Are you serious?

407
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,603
Uh...

408
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,649
perhaps if you would explain...

409
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,817
I don't have time to explain!

410
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,611
Now you were supposed to reboot.

411
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:33,365
- I cannot recall agreeing to that.
- You don't recall anything!

412
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,076
That's what I've been saying.

413
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,246
Now, screw your half-assed sticky notes!

414
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,917
And screw whatever you're trying to hold
onto in that nanodust brain of yours.

415
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,088
Now either you reboot or find someone else
to follow like a lost dog.

416
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,424
Now do you think you can remember that?

417
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,345
Those words will be hard to forget.

418
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,100
Poe...

419
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,522
you're gonna get me killed.

420
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,736
May I ask where are you going?

421
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,222
You don't look good Takeshi<i>-san.</i>

422
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,182
It's been a long day.

423
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,772
I found the Meths you're looking for.

424
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,233
They're at the Soul Market.

425
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,485
Soul Market?

426
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,906
The war's left us with too many stacks
and not enough sleeves.

427
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,700
They have to go somewhere.

428
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,995
The man who owns it, Semetaire,

429
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:06,916
has made good business out of ransoming
stacks back to families.

430
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,586
Sounds charming.

431
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:14,090
He also extracts digitized memories

432
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,676
and repurposes them for...

433
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,386
entertainment.

434
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,975
Anton Durov and Haruki Okada
frequent his club.

435
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,563
You can't walk in off the street.
You have to be on the list.

436
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,523
So get me the hell on it.

437
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,651
Don't give me commands, Takeshi.

438
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,695
You haven't found her.

439
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,823
I thought I had...

440
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,492
for a minute.

441
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,995
It's a sleeve-jacker.

442
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:49,125
That's no excuse to take your misfortune
out on a friend.

443
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,296
It seems to be what I'm best at.

444
00:27:56,716 --> 00:28:01,137
<i>Oyabun,</i> someone's walking around
in her skin.

445
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,473
So you want to punish them?

446
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,016
Punish them?

447
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,644
I'd rather put a million bullets
in that sleeve

448
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,437
than let an impostor defile it.

449
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,191
And when that stack hits VR,
it's gonna be a million more deaths,

450
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,567
far worse than that.

451
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,945
You don't know, do you?

452
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,280
There are rumors...

453
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:25,120
whispers that it was more than
Axley's sleeve that was destroyed.

454
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,833
That all of his DHF backups
were erased as well.

455
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,753
Be careful.

456
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,507
These Meths may have answers you seek.

457
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:42,679
But follow them
and the killer might turn on you.

458
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,141
I hope they do.

459
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,560
Save me some time.

460
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:50,812
This is it.

461
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,566
You're on the list.

462
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,110
<i>Arigato, Oyabun.</i>

463
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,612
As you set down this path,

464
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:03,950
consider is your anger truly
with this impostor,

465
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,702
or is it with yourself?

466
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,539
There's more than enough to go around.

467
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,041
So why choose?

468
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,811
<i> Nothing is sacred.</i>

469
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,233
<i>Every gift we've been given...</i>

470
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,865
<i>every resource discovered...</i>

471
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,662
<i>each new and shining thing
that catches our eye...</i>

472
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:52,999
<i>we pollute...</i>

473
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,669
<i>disrespect...</i>

474
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,005
<i>violate.</i>

475
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,968
<i>We tell ourselves this is progress.</i>

476
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,766
<i>Selling each other the fruits
of our destruction.</i>

477
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,980
<i>Sparing no thought to what we lose...</i>

478
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,070
<i>or leave behind, churning in our wake.</i>

479
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,845
You Semetaire?

480
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,972
I am a simple ferryman,

481
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,934
plucking souls from my ocean wide.

482
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,896
Soldier, miner, sex worker, laborer.

483
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:00,608
Ah, no one swims for long.

484
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,445
Not with you stripping 'em
of their memories they don't.

485
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,865
Their lives are worthless.

486
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,786
Their experiences are not.

487
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,582
So what if someone comes around
looking for 'em?

488
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,917
Nobody's claiming them.

489
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:22,171
But they can still bring pleasure to some.

490
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,014
So...

491
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,517
what pleasure do you seek?

492
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,524
I'll have what they're having.

493
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,860
I can accommodate you.

494
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,112
Provided you are on the list.

495
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,366
<i>Confirmed.</i>

496
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,243
Ah, follow me.

497
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,006
You really think
Quellists murdered that Meth?

498
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,092
If it keeps us on planet, I do.

499
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,059
Ever hear of Constantinople?

500
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,312
The Earth city?

501
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:22,106
It stood unconquered for over 1,000 years.

502
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,609
The walls were impenetrable.

503
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:30,073
Until one day, a small gate
was left unlocked during a siege.

504
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,575
There was no sabotage, no traitor.

505
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,787
A simple mistake
and the enemy poured through.

506
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,291
All because the man with the key
fell down on the job.

507
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,418
Governor Harlan is the man with the key.

508
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,796
The man with the key is her father.

509
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,299
He kept the Protectorate at bay
for centuries.

510
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,262
Until one day, he abandoned his post
and left his daughter in charge.

511
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,849
She's the gate.

512
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,393
We've got a hit on the sleeve.

513
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,066
Gear up.

514
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,500
Thank you.

515
00:34:12,507 --> 00:34:14,177
Holy shit.

516
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,388
The way you screamed.

517
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,514
Told ya.

518
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,850
I forgot what real fear felt like.

519
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,726
No rush quite like it, right?

520
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,646
This is a private party, stranger.

521
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,483
Oh, I'm sorry.

522
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,360
Seemed like your friend
could use a chaser.

523
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,406
I'd share, but...

524
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,199
Oh.

525
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,119
Haruki, relax.

526
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:44,331
Just a fellow mudraker
looking to feel alive.

527
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:48,710
Sit.

528
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:50,922
Please.

529
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:04,310
On to a more divine plane then.

530
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,020
Absolutely.

531
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,207
Someone's been busy.

532
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,000
What?

533
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,962
These are the top five gets on the planet.

534
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,463
How did you swing that?

535
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,675
Let's just say I was highly motivated
this evening.

536
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,718
Are you cashing out?

537
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,140
I don't know. Any hits on my guy?

538
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:43,933
Let's see.

539
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:46,936
No.

540
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,896
Nothing new.

541
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,234
All the missing people out there,
it's hard to stand out.

542
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,361
You know the drill, Trepp.

543
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,489
More credits, more hits.

544
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,329
- Up it. Up the reward.
- How much?

545
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,498
All of it.

546
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,457
Are you sure?

547
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,088
Some things are more important than money.

548
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,895
Friend, I don't give a fuck who you are.

549
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,731
This is the best shit I've had
in a century.

550
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,525
- Hey, about earlier...
- Ah, don't worry about it.

551
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,237
Everyone seems on edge since Axley
went and got himself killed yesterday.

552
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,156
You know Horace?

553
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,450
We met briefly.

554
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,910
He's a wet blanket.

555
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,454
Afraid of his own goddamn shadow.

556
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,955
It seems like he had reason to be.

557
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,166
Oh, you don't get it. He was losing it.

558
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,627
Talking about the damn bogeyman.

559
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,128
About what?

560
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,882
Quellcrist Falconer. She's back.

561
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,300
Here to kill us all.

562
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,135
What about Quellcrist Falconer?

563
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,887
He obviously rode some doctored patch,

564
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,805
but you're not gonna convince Horace
of that.

565
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,684
Well, here's hoping he stays on Latimer
until he gets it out of his system.

566
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,061
Oh, you got it wrong.

567
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,605
My man Axley is not on Latimer.

568
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,982
He's not anywhere.

569
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,943
What are you talking about?

570
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,487
Well, whatever bogeyman he saw,
it got him.

571
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,322
I hear he's dead.

572
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,741
Real dead.

573
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,913
And for all you guys know,
you could be next.

574
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,208
You still got the patch?

575
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,589
Listen, I can protect you,

576
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,092
but I need to see what Axley saw.

577
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,681
Give us a minute.

578
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,314
Is this your private reserve?

579
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,817
Semetaire lets us keep the good stuff.

580
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,403
Even when it's contraband.

581
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,627
Here.

582
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,189
Everything turned to ruin.

583
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,233
Everything lost.

584
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,777
Hey! Put the knife down.

585
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,904
...turned to ruin.

586
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,783
I said put the knife down!

587
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,174
Mom!

588
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,717
No!

589
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,594
No!

590
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,434
It's not her.

591
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,770
That's what we've been trying to tell ya.

592
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,031
What the fuck?

593
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:30,743
Who are you?

594
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,002
That sleeve is not yours.

595
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,187
Can you hear them?

596
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,499
Do you hear the screams?

597
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,977
You're not leaving here in that sleeve!

598
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,914
Who are you?

599
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,553
Tak?

600
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,306
Quell.

601
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:09,985
Quell.

602
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,328
You need to leave. Now.

603
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,288
Go.

604
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,623
I'll find you.

605
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,335
Protectorate.

606
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,504
Don't move.

607
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,175
You're under arrest.

608
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,972
You don't wanna hear my side?

609
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,351
Move and he's dead.

610
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,523
What's the matter?
Pull the trigger, skulljump.

611
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,363
What the fuck?

612
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,742
You can't do it.
No matter how much you want to.

613
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:04,164
That sleeve your wearing is Wedge tech.

614
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,044
Let me put it in terms you'll understand.

615
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,880
If we're talking wolves...

616
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,425
I'm the alpha.

617
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:18,012
You are nothing but my bitch.

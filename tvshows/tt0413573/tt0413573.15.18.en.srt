1
00:00:02,407 --> 00:00:05,914
Anesthesiology is a lot more
challenging than it looks...

2
00:00:05,915 --> 00:00:07,455
...because it's mostly math.

3
00:00:07,489 --> 00:00:09,896
Environment affects health.

4
00:00:09,896 --> 00:00:11,230
And I want to quantify it.

5
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,031
See if we can have a positive impact

6
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:15,367
on patient health pre- and post-op,

7
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:17,936
even reduce the need for heart surgeries.

8
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:19,137
What kind of environments?

9
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:21,873
A patient's weight,

10
00:00:21,908 --> 00:00:24,309
their estimated blood volume,
their lung function...

11
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:26,478
all these variables
have to be accounted for.

12
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:29,214
Plant life improves physical well-being.

13
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:32,317
It decreases anxiety
and lowers blood pressure.

14
00:00:32,352 --> 00:00:34,119
Increases attentiveness.

15
00:00:34,153 --> 00:00:36,822
Parker, leave that tree by the window.

16
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:38,724
I want to forget that we are in the city.

17
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:40,107
This is a jungle.

18
00:00:40,142 --> 00:00:42,060
It takes careful calculation

19
00:00:42,095 --> 00:00:45,063
to suspend a person
between life and death.

20
00:00:45,098 --> 00:00:48,066
Full-body exposure
to high levels of blue light

21
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:49,801
reduces systolic blood pressure

22
00:00:49,836 --> 00:00:53,672
the same amount as it is
reduced in certain drug trials.

23
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:55,173
So this could replace medicine?

24
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,642
I want to find out.

25
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:59,978
And if one of those variables is off,

26
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:02,014
you might wake up
in the middle of your surgery.

27
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:03,682
So, we all know the neurological benefits

28
00:01:03,716 --> 00:01:05,017
of puzzles and games.

29
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:06,543
I want to see if those same benefits

30
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:07,797
spread throughout the body,

31
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:10,022
which brings us to door number three.

32
00:01:10,056 --> 00:01:11,523
Or never wake up at all.

33
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:13,859
I see you've found
the game room, Dr. Bailey.

34
00:01:13,893 --> 00:01:15,661
How are you feeling?

35
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:18,096
Oh, my stress levels
have never been better.

36
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:20,365
Ah, they never give you
the long, skinny piece!

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
Why do they do that?!

38
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:24,169
So, any volunteers?

39
00:01:28,308 --> 00:01:30,142
- Hey.
- Hey.

40
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:31,510
Any, uh, word from your dad?

41
00:01:31,544 --> 00:01:33,111
Have you heard anything or...

42
00:01:33,146 --> 00:01:35,280
Uh, no. No, I haven't.

43
00:01:36,582 --> 00:01:38,650
I have some rounds. I should probably...

44
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:40,452
Yeah, sure.

45
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,325
Dr. Martin to Pediatrics.

46
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,826
Dr. Sarah Martin...

47
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:51,063
Hey, good news... I can make it
to the birthing class today.

48
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:52,631
I thought you were
covering the ER for me.

49
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:54,032
You know, so could attend.

50
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:55,300
Uh, Webber's got it,

51
00:01:55,335 --> 00:01:57,069
but if you'd rather I didn't go, then...

52
00:01:57,103 --> 00:01:58,970
- No, it's fine. It's great. Uh...
- Okay, great.

53
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:01,273
Well, I'll do my post-ops,
and then I'll see you up there?

54
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:04,976
I should have told him
you were coming, too.

55
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:06,411
Oh, it's fine. It's better than fine...

56
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:08,413
it's what I secretly
was hoping for all along.

57
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:11,216
I think he and I are about
this close to becoming besties.

58
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,251
You're joking,
but it's what I'm rooting for.

59
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:14,403
Hey, I got to go change

60
00:02:14,437 --> 00:02:15,721
into my "supportive boyfriend" clothes.

61
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:17,322
You... You good?

62
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:18,533
Yes, thank you.

63
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,728
Ow!

64
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:24,996
Ow.

65
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:28,166
All right, move off whatever
organ you're on, soldier.

66
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:30,535
Okay.

67
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,405
Ah. At ease.

68
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:39,511
This is Jo. Leave a mess...

69
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:47,753
What are you doing in here?

70
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:48,887
Hey. Research.

71
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:50,655
I needed a change of scenery,

72
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:51,981
and, you know, I have to say,

73
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:53,925
the plants are actually very soothing.

74
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,527
What are you working on?

75
00:02:57,497 --> 00:02:58,518
What is it?

76
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,266
Ingestible diagnostic device.

77
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,934
- Ingestible?
- Mm-hmm.

78
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:04,403
I mean, I think. I don't know.

79
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:06,271
It came to me in a dream, sort of, so...

80
00:03:08,474 --> 00:03:10,909
How's Jo's trip going?
Did she meet her mom?

81
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:12,210
I don't know. I haven't talked to her.

82
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:14,293
How's DeLuca?

83
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:16,141
Where'd you say she was
going, Pittsburgh?

84
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,215
Yeah.

85
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,785
Is he still being weird?
'Cause he's on my service today.

86
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,486
Why do you keep changing the subject?

87
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:22,602
Why do you?

88
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:26,324
She... She's not answering her phone.

89
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:28,760
She hasn't texted all day. I'm worried.

90
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:31,296
Well, okay, so, she's probably
just gonna come home

91
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,798
and tell you everything.

92
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:34,132
What about the Italian?

93
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,567
Big blowup with the dad.

94
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:37,159
Big.

95
00:03:37,537 --> 00:03:38,983
Does not want my input.

96
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:40,043
Ohh.

97
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:42,107
So I'm just trying to give him a minute.

98
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:44,075
Your boyfriend's being weird,

99
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,811
and, uh, you're hiding out in plants?

100
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:48,346
Well, if I was hiding out,
you wouldn't be able to find me.

101
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:54,453
Blue light lowers blood pressure?

102
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:55,921
Significantly.

103
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:58,023
And some studies suggest that

104
00:03:58,057 --> 00:04:00,158
it could even improve your mood, so...

105
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:02,494
And I'm not saying
it's a cure-all or anything,

106
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:04,463
but you might want to spend some time...

107
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:09,134
Okay, the room doesn't work that fast...

108
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:10,435
What's going on?

109
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,703
Nothing.

110
00:04:11,737 --> 00:04:13,038
Nothing?

111
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:14,873
'Cause the last time I saw you

112
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:16,374
there was a fair amount of crying,

113
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:19,611
and exactly zero chair spinning.

114
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:21,179
Fine.

115
00:04:21,214 --> 00:04:23,482
I might have had some insanely good sex

116
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:25,350
at the conference in San Diego.

117
00:04:25,384 --> 00:04:27,219
Oh, wait, what?

118
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:28,295
You had insane sex

119
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:29,955
with a complete stranger in San Diego?

120
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:31,490
Not a complete stranger.

121
00:04:31,524 --> 00:04:33,458
And not insane sex. Insanely good sex.

122
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:35,660
And it helped my mood
a lot more than this blue room.

123
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:38,530
Oh, okay, so, like a rebound.

124
00:04:38,564 --> 00:04:40,165
- More like muscle bound.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!

125
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,000
Knock, knock.

126
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:43,635
- Hi.
- Dr. Pierce.

127
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,070
Uh...

128
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:48,473
I took a look at your
sternal reconstruction thing,

129
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:49,539
and I e-mailed you some...

130
00:04:49,564 --> 00:04:50,585
- some thoughts.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

131
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:51,691
Yeah, sorry it took me so long...

132
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,712
I was at a conference in San Diego.

133
00:04:56,516 --> 00:04:57,816
Oh.

134
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:02,876
- Nice room.
- Yeah.

135
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,356
Very blue.

136
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,590
Yeah.

137
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,026
It's very cool. Dr. Shepherd.

138
00:05:09,929 --> 00:05:11,830
Oh, my God.

139
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:13,665
It was a one-time thing! That is it!

140
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:16,034
I just needed some pain management.

141
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:17,869
Does this room change colors?
Does it do pink?

142
00:05:17,904 --> 00:05:20,405
- No.
- Okay, then.

143
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:26,545
So, Mom just decided not to
start back to work this week.

144
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:28,446
You don't know if she's in pain,
or is she tired?

145
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:29,659
She didn't give me a reason.

146
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:32,083
She waved her hand
and said "cancer card."

147
00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:33,685
That's her new shorthand for...

148
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:34,953
- "Stop questioning me."
- Exactly.

149
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:36,221
Let's move!

150
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:37,455
- Go.
- Get the second one.

151
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,757
Kari Donnelly, 50,

152
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,426
complains of neck and back pain
after a snowmobile collision.

153
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,896
BP 150 over 90, tachycardic
with some leg weakness on exam.

154
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:46,131
Okay, got her. Let's go.

155
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:48,567
Toby Donnelly, 22, snowmobile passenger.

156
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:51,303
Sustained a deep soft tissue
injury to the left upper arm.

157
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:52,370
- Mm-hmm.
- Vital signs stable.

158
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:53,405
That's all clear!

159
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,706
Is my mom okay?

160
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,641
She always drives so fricking fast.

161
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:58,284
Will you tell her that? She...

162
00:05:58,318 --> 00:05:59,644
All right, let's go!
Let's go! Let's go now!

163
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,581
On it!

164
00:06:02,615 --> 00:06:04,616
Dr. Oper to Oncology.

165
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,650
Dr. Rick Oper...

166
00:06:05,685 --> 00:06:07,452
Hey, I got your page.

167
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:08,642
Yeah. Well...

168
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:11,562
11-year-old girl
with chronic pancreatitis. Ouch.

169
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:13,425
And I've known this kid since she was 5.

170
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:15,160
Today, she's getting
a total pancreatectomy.

171
00:06:15,194 --> 00:06:17,062
And you're gonna give her the good news.

172
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:18,897
- Why me?
- 'Cause I'm a nice guy.

173
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:20,791
What... you don't feel
like being a hero today?

174
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:26,605
Are you solving for "Y"? It's 11.

175
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,306
Um... Unh-unh.

176
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:29,374
It's not.

177
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:32,644
I took two years of Integral
and Differential Calc.

178
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:34,400
I was going into theoretical math.

179
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:35,500
It's 11.

180
00:06:35,535 --> 00:06:39,150
I just do this for fun. And it's 14.

181
00:06:39,185 --> 00:06:40,418
Shut up!

182
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:42,253
Sorry. Sorry.

183
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:44,589
But how are you that good at math?

184
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:46,389
Qadri, let's do it.

185
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:49,160
This is Nora Hillridge, age 11.

186
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:51,296
She was diagnosed
with hereditary pancreatitis

187
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,364
at age 5.

188
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:54,099
She's been hospitalized
for the last six months.

189
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:55,600
And why haven't we helped her?

190
00:06:55,635 --> 00:06:58,203
A number of criteria need to align

191
00:06:58,237 --> 00:06:59,638
in order to perform her surgery...

192
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:02,707
her APACHE II score should be below 4,

193
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:06,111
her amylase, lipase, LDH,
and base deficit

194
00:07:06,145 --> 00:07:07,278
should be within normal limits.

195
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:09,180
Her fasting glucose and
C peptide levels should be...

196
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:10,882
All right. All right, got it.

197
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,017
DeLuca?

198
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:15,654
The hope has always been
to do a total pancreatectomy

199
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:17,036
with in islet autotransplantation,

200
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,525
so she won't get diabetes
or even need insulin shots.

201
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,695
And today, all the elements have aligned.

202
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:25,797
Your numbers are perfect,
Nora, and today...

203
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:27,565
- No.
- ...we are taking you to surgery!

204
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,200
Ahh!

205
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:31,002
Nora!

206
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:33,471
Oh, you can go back to school!

207
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,309
How long will I have to recover?

208
00:07:38,344 --> 00:07:40,011
We'll have you out
of here before you know it.

209
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:41,846
Thank you, thank you.

210
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:44,416
- Thank you! Thank you!
- I...

211
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,684
Uh, okay.

212
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,759
- Major Altman?
- I didn't see you'd signed up.

213
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:56,020
Does this room work?

214
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:58,163
Studies show that 400 nanometers
of blue light...

215
00:07:58,197 --> 00:08:01,032
I just need to know if it works!

216
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,600
I apologize for that.

217
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:04,736
I started to feel a little sore
about an hour ago,

218
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,571
and

219
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:09,074
I'm hoping that it's just stress,

220
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:12,744
and if Pierce is onto
something, then I-I just...

221
00:08:14,313 --> 00:08:16,581
- Okay. Okay, nope.
- Ohh.

222
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:18,550
Nope, not stress.

223
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:19,796
Feels more like...

224
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,921
like my body is pushing out
all of my organs.

225
00:08:22,955 --> 00:08:24,022
I'll get a wheelchair.

226
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:26,003
- Page OB! And Owen Hunt.
- Okay.

227
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:27,659
Stay right where you are, soldier!

228
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:30,295
Not you! You go!

229
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:31,730
Okay, okay, no, no. Okay, no.

230
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:34,733
Okay, okay, wait, no, no.

231

Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

232
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:46,512
Okay.

233
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:48,481
You think Teddy wants, uh, soft or firm?

234
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:50,031
Uh, I think Teddy has
a partner for this class,

235
00:08:50,065 --> 00:08:51,117
so you can head out.

236
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:53,319
Okay, everyone, on your mats.

237
00:08:53,353 --> 00:08:54,948
Moms leaning against partners

238
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:56,280
for lumbar support.

239
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:57,790
You want to hold or be held?

240
00:08:57,825 --> 00:08:59,822
Oh.

241
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:00,960
Uh, I gotta go.

242
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:02,662
Y...

243
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:06,065
He's very busy and, uh, important, so...

244
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,266
I'll just...

245
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:10,403
What is happening down there?
Am I dilated? Effaced?

246
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:11,504
Is there a foot sticking out?

247
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:13,306
I need answers.

248
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,574
You can scoot up.

249
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:16,075
- You're not in labor.
- Okay.

250
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,511
Your contractions are sporadic
and not very strong.

251
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:19,664
Not very strong?

252
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:21,247
What do they feel like
when they're strong?

253
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:23,583
You do, however,
have cervical insufficiency.

254
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:25,384
Okay, where's the button?

255
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:26,466
What button?

256
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,020
I'm putting myself in Trendelenburg.

257
00:09:28,055 --> 00:09:30,423
Gravity might help prevent preterm labor.

258
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:32,925
How about you let me
put you in Trendelenburg?

259
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,061
How about you push some meds
to stop these contractions

260
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:37,663
and stop pretending like
now isn't the time to panic?

261
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:39,432
I assure you, Dr. Altman,

262
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:42,401
I'll do everything I can
to keep the baby inside,

263
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:43,536
and if she's born today...

264
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,780
No, no, no, no.

265
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:46,439
She's not ready, and,
frankly, neither am I...

266
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:48,841
Wow, this is really not comfortable.

267
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:50,409
What the hell happened?

268
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:52,578
Hey.

269
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:54,914
You okay?

270
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:56,916
Dr. Campbell to the Stepdown Unit.

271
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,451
I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna tell people

272
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:00,419
- about what happened?
- We did.

273
00:10:00,454 --> 00:10:02,188
Why did you tell Maggie
you were in San Diego?

274
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:03,356
'Cause I was. At a conference.

275
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,525
Well, I told her
I had sex at a conference.

276
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,560
Wait, so you told her about the sex,

277
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:09,395
but I'm in trouble
for mentioning a location?

278
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:11,764
Okay, can I just reiterate
that this was a one-time thing?

279
00:10:11,798 --> 00:10:12,899
I mean, it was just...

280
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:14,200
Pain management, like you said.

281
00:10:14,234 --> 00:10:16,202
For acute pain, not chronic.

282
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:18,017
One dose. Do not refill.

283
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:20,473
Ew, sorry. I'm just saying,

284
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:21,807
to be safe, I think we should probably

285
00:10:21,842 --> 00:10:23,409
steer clear of each other for a while.

286
00:10:23,443 --> 00:10:25,442
- You really think that's necessary?
- I do. Because...

287
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,114
- ...pheromones.
- What about them?

288
00:10:28,882 --> 00:10:30,983
- I really like yours.
- Okay, then.

289
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:32,218
I'll avoid you completely.

290
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:36,289
- You paged?
- You paged?

291
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:39,058
Oh, Dr. Shepherd, uh, Dr. Lincoln,

292
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:41,494
Kari Donnelly...
she rolled her snowmobile.

293
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:43,129
Not on purpose.

294
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:44,397
Now, the films just came up,

295
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:45,898
but I need to help Dr. Avery.

296
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:49,902
Toby says I was driving too fast.

297
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:51,470
I tell them,

298
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:53,272
why have a throttle
if you don't crank it?

299
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:54,440
Well, this may be why.

300
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:56,642
Film shows fractures at C4 and 5.

301
00:10:56,677 --> 00:10:59,912
Is that bad? How bad is it?

302
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:02,181
We won't know how bad it is
until we get some scans.

303
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:04,116
- Can you feel this?
- Yes.

304
00:11:04,151 --> 00:11:05,451
That's good.

305
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:07,486
- I'd like to take her for an MRI.
- I'd like to get her an MRI.

306
00:11:10,657 --> 00:11:11,958
Oh, God.

307
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,528
Hey, uh, how we doing here?

308
00:11:15,562 --> 00:11:17,330
No palpable pulse in the arm,

309
00:11:17,364 --> 00:11:19,665
getting a weak Doppler signal,
it sounds like.

310
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,701
Got some arterial compromise, as well.

311
00:11:21,735 --> 00:11:23,502
I-Is my mom okay?

312
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:26,005
Oh, she's stable... we'll...
we'll know more soon, okay?

313
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,573
Let's make sure you have
no other injuries.

314
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:30,943
Snowmobiling was her idea.

315
00:11:30,978 --> 00:11:33,279
She's always pushing me to face my fears.

316
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:36,315
She was right. It was a lot of fun.

317
00:11:37,384 --> 00:11:38,851
God, why is she always right?

318
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:39,785
I know how you feel.

319
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,688
I mean, fun till
she swerved to miss a tree

320
00:11:42,723 --> 00:11:45,691
and flipped us five times.

321
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:48,494
Hey, uh, we should get a CT angio...

322
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:51,163
...to determine the location
of her vascular injuries.

323
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:53,065
- "Their."
- Excuse me?

324
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,368
"Their" injury, not "her."

325
00:11:55,402 --> 00:11:56,902
I'm a "they."

326
00:11:56,937 --> 00:11:58,838
I'm gender-queer.

327
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:00,806
- Non-binary.
- Got it.

328
00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:02,842
Thank you for letting us know
your pronouns.

329
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:05,411
Their preferred pronouns
are "they" and "them."

330
00:12:05,445 --> 00:12:08,581
Oh, okay, uh, yes.
Uh, w-well, a-all right, then.

331
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:12,852
Um, w-well, let's get you... all?

332
00:12:12,886 --> 00:12:14,987
"You" is fine.

333
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:17,490
Great. Well, your ultrasound is fine.

334
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:19,392
Let's get you up to CT.

335
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:25,765
This is really why you paged me?

336
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,600
Just read.

337
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:30,002
"Glenda mapped a town using a scale

338
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:32,505
that was 5 inches and equals 1 yard.

339
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:34,407
What scale factor does her drawing use?"

340
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:35,708
Okay, one yard equals three,

341
00:12:35,742 --> 00:12:38,244
divided by seven and 1/5...

342
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:41,747
5 to 7.2 is the ratio.

343
00:12:41,782 --> 00:12:43,749
You didn't write! You need to write.

344
00:12:43,784 --> 00:12:45,084
- Let's go again.
- Okay, okay.

345
00:12:45,118 --> 00:12:46,752
Let's get her prepped, guys.

346
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:48,854
One more, please? An easy one.

347
00:12:49,294 --> 00:12:50,790
All right.

348
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:53,793
Okay. "A line L is perpendicular

349
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:57,563
to the line 2x - 5y - 8 = 0.

350
00:12:57,597 --> 00:12:59,765
What is the slope of the line L?"

351
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,634
That was supposed to be an easy one?

352
00:13:01,668 --> 00:13:03,369
Hey, Nora.

353
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:06,372
I, uh... I got some bad news.

354
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:07,740
I just ran your pre-op blood work,

355
00:13:07,774 --> 00:13:08,825
and I don't know why,

356
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:10,776
but your glucose level has shot way up.

357
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:13,746
No! She was just in the clear!

358
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,781
Was it a lab error this morning,
or what happened?

359
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:16,949
I'm not sure yet.

360
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:19,118
The bottom line is, we have to
put you on an insulin drip

361
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:20,753
to lower your blood sugar,

362
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:22,555
which means we have to
postpone your surgery

363
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:23,721
till we can sort this out.

364
00:13:23,755 --> 00:13:26,058
It's been six months
getting her to this point.

365
00:13:26,093 --> 00:13:28,661
Well, let's just keep
our fingers crossed, okay?

366
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:36,836
Negative five over two.

367
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,471
Beat you.

368
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:44,115
I don't know how this happened.
Sorry about this.

369
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:46,112
Don't be sorry for me. Be sorry for her.

370
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:49,849
Did Meredith ask you to do this?

371
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:51,040
Throw me a bone? Give me a win?

372
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:52,651
Is that what this is? 'Cause I'm good.

373
00:13:52,686 --> 00:13:54,253
I had a bad week, and I moved on.

374
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:55,588
I don't need any favors.

375
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,074

376
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:06,465
I've got to get off this case.

377
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,708
Scans are up.

378
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:16,310
- Bulging disc at C5.
- Crap.

379
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:18,177
Did you see L-3?

380
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:19,812
Yeah, L-4 is worse.

381
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:22,448
Total obliteration of the CSF space

382
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:23,616
and displacement of the cauda.

383
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,140
She could end up paraplegic.

384
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,888
I'd rather not handle
this case on my own.

385
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:32,691
Understood.

386
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:42,334
If you're gonna take up
all my time slots,

387
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,619
could you at least put a cuff on
so I can take your data?

388
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:46,071
I'm about to beat the high score.

389
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:47,807
Which you just set 20 minutes ago.

390
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:49,642
Oh, then you should've hooked me up then.

391
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:51,677
You pressed "restart" before
we could get the cuff on you.

392
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:52,845
You snooze, you...

393
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,747
Oh, oh, ah!

394
00:14:54,781 --> 00:14:57,483
See?! Look what happened!

395
00:14:57,517 --> 00:14:59,552
Ah!

396
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:01,720
I was wondering if we could
borrow Dr. Schmitt.

397
00:15:01,755 --> 00:15:03,422
- Is it urgent?
- Yes.

398
00:15:03,457 --> 00:15:06,192
No. No.

399
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:07,726
I have a patient who's a math whiz,

400
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:09,228
and she's crushing me, and I need backup.

401
00:15:09,262 --> 00:15:12,364
May I go? In school,
they called me "Numbers."

402
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,234
- But not kindly.
- Yeah, go.

403
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:16,381
Hold on.

404
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,872
Uh, just how good is this math whiz?

405
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:22,708
Yeah, please define "whiz"?

406
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,161
"Insufficient cervix." I mean...

407
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:56,097
"insufficient" is something
I've never been called

408
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:57,064
in my entire life.

409
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:58,899
Are you sure this is
really the best option?

410
00:15:58,934 --> 00:16:02,002
Dr. Altman is following
her own course of treatment.

411
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:04,105
That being said, um, I agree with it.

412
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,240
There is no hourglassing
of the membranes anymore,

413
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:08,275
so I think it's working.

414
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,877
- Um, I'll check on you every hour.
- Okay.

415
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:11,379
Okay, is there anything
I can do to help, or...

416
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:15,082
Stay calm and talk to the baby.
Reassure her.

417
00:16:15,117 --> 00:16:17,251
It'll be good for her
to hear your voices.

418
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:18,619
Okay. Thank you.

419
00:16:27,295 --> 00:16:29,585
Hey there, little one.

420
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,032
We still haven't bought you a crib,

421
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,960
but we're almost ready.

422
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,081
- Owen.
- Eh...

423
00:16:35,115 --> 00:16:36,170
My face is up here.

424
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,248
I'm not talking to you.

425
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,641
And you wait till you meet

426
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:42,476
your big brother, Leo.

427
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:44,645
He's got so many toys to share with you.

428
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,080
Uh, okay, you can't use that voice.

429
00:16:46,114 --> 00:16:47,251
No?

430
00:16:49,117 --> 00:16:50,151
This is your dad.

431
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:53,821
- I'm very pleased to meet you.
- Okay.

432
00:16:53,855 --> 00:16:55,423
- Okay? Okay?
- That's perfect.

433
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:56,824
Now she'll be afraid to come out.

434
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:59,460
Pleeeasse stay inside

435
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:01,395
for another month or two, okay?

436
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,164
- Okay.
- Okay, you're freaking me out now.

437
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:08,102
1,000 plus 20 plus 30 plus 1,000

438
00:17:08,136 --> 00:17:10,740
plus 1,030 plus 1,000 plus 20 equals...

439
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:11,806
- 5,000!
- 5,000! - 5,000!

440
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,340
- 4,100!
- 4,100!

441
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,046
What? I call witchcraft!

442
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,244
I got it right! But she got there first.

443
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,479
I bet you let me win.

444
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:20,347
Little girl, ask any of these people

445
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:22,249
if I ever let anybody win anything.

446
00:17:22,284 --> 00:17:23,651
She hasn't ever.

447
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:26,787
I give up. This is embarrassing.

448
00:17:26,822 --> 00:17:28,589
Don't give up, be on my team.

449
00:17:28,623 --> 00:17:30,090
I don't think I make the cut.

450
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,625
Come on. Come on.

451
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,160
There you go.

452
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:36,330
This is so nice of you.

453
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:38,132
True or false...

454
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,668
0.9 repeating equals one?

455
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:44,171
Okay, wait, i-i-if
3.9 repeating is four...

456
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:46,207
- Times... Times 10...
- False!

457
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:47,441
No, no, true!

458
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:49,176
No, wait, I-it's infinite 9s!

459
00:17:49,211 --> 00:17:50,611
- Oh, Schmitt, shush!
- True.

460
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:51,846
It's true. Here.

461
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:57,184
Well, if you do it like that.

462
00:18:00,222 --> 00:18:02,289
Nothing's going on, right?

463
00:18:02,324 --> 00:18:03,774
With my mom?

464
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:05,960
Nothing I should be worried about?

465
00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:09,330
It's not, like, s-something,
and you're just not telling me?

466
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:11,232
Now, why would you say that?

467
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:14,535
Oh, I don't know...
because I blithely assumed

468
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:16,804
my mother did not have cancer
when, in fact, she did,

469
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:18,305
and none of you told me.

470
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,276
Well, I found out after you,
if you'll recall.

471
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:25,145
Look, I know you're scared, son.

472
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,747
I'm not scared, all right?

473
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:29,383
I'm just... concerned.

474
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:32,412
They're all settled.

475
00:18:35,423 --> 00:18:38,659
Do we really have
to use this plural thing,

476
00:18:38,693 --> 00:18:39,719
even when she can't hear us?

477
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:41,762
While they... they can't hear us.

478
00:18:41,796 --> 00:18:43,998
Okay, yeah. It's not that complicated.

479
00:18:44,032 --> 00:18:45,266
Not that complicated?

480
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,700
We're talking about a single entity,

481
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:47,835
but "they" is plural.

482
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:50,905
I mean, it requires a plural verb.

483
00:18:50,939 --> 00:18:53,407
Or am I supposed to say, "They is"?

484
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:55,276
No, look, if you're in a movie theater

485
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,511
and somebody's coat is left in a seat,

486
00:18:57,546 --> 00:18:58,579
and you bring it to the usher,

487
00:18:58,613 --> 00:18:59,780
what do you say to the usher?

488
00:18:59,814 --> 00:19:01,715
Well, a number of things.

489
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,852
Um, I might say,
"Someone left behind a coat,"

490
00:19:04,886 --> 00:19:06,554
or, "I found someone's coat,"

491
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:08,422
or, "Turn this in to the lost and found."

492
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:10,524
I might say, "Somebody left their coat."

493
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,359
Then you'd be grammatically incorrect.

494
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:13,761
Ungrammatical.

495
00:19:14,496 --> 00:19:16,864
Excuse me?

496
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:20,267
Uh, something's either
grammatical or it's not.

497
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:21,902
"Grammatically incorrect" is like saying

498
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:24,371
something is right-wrong.

499
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,208
- Scans are up.
- It's about time.

500
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:31,378
All right, Helm, what do you see?

501
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:34,114
Absence of flow in
the mid-brachial artery.

502
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:36,050
Okay, we need to get her up to the OR.

503
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:37,418
Really?

504
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:41,422
Okay, them, them, them!

505
00:19:41,456 --> 00:19:43,557
Can we go now?

506
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:45,225
Almighty...

507
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,162
Now I feel pins and needles.

508
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:50,064
You still feeling this?

509
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:51,215
I do...

510
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,300
but less.

511
00:19:54,502 --> 00:19:56,904
Why am I... Why am I feeling it less?

512
00:19:56,938 --> 00:19:59,573
Kari, you suffered two injuries
to your spine.

513
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:01,909
The lower one is quite severe.

514
00:20:01,943 --> 00:20:04,411
Your neuro exam is getting
progressively worse,

515
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:05,412
so we need to get in there

516
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:08,449
before you are paralyzed
from the waist down.

517
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:10,351
I might become paralyzed?

518
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:12,453
- No...
- We're gonna do everything we can

519
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,321
to reverse the compression of the nerves.

520
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:16,790
Oh, God, please...

521
00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:22,371
I can't do a wheelchair.

522
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:24,999
I never sit!

523
00:20:27,187 --> 00:20:29,269
Go... Go ask Toby.

524
00:20:29,304 --> 00:20:33,507
W-We're supposed to do
a sprint triathlon next month.

525
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,810
We are going to do
everything that we can.

526
00:20:39,714 --> 00:20:41,382
Your boyfriend's being a jerk.

527
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,850
What did he do?

528
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:44,685
Oh, wait. None of my business.

529
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:47,388
Uh, he has to work
this all out by himself.

530
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:49,016
I was just trying to do him a favor.

531
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,491
Well, I'm not getting involved,

532
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:52,893
and please don't bring
any stress into the green zone.

533
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,364
- Hey. There you are.
- Hey.

534
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:59,566
I was just gonna actually take a break.

535
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:00,668
You want to go grab a coffee?

536
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:02,569
Uh, I meant Dr. Karev.

537
00:21:02,604 --> 00:21:04,038
Oh.

538
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:05,973
Um, we think we know
why Nora's glucose shot up.

539
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:08,575
Qadri found this under her pillow.

540
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,178
We think she may have sabotaged
the surgery.

541
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:13,847
We got to go.

542
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:15,149
Yep.

543
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:25,950
Why would you do this when
we've been waiting and waiting?

544
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,883
- Why?
- Mom, stop.

545
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,519
I'm not stopping
until you tell us why you...

546
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,354
Because I don't want
to go back to school!

547
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,494
I hate it.

548
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:40,430
It's all cliques and stupid
girls with stupid crushes

549
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,200
and stupid boys who get mad
when I beat them at math.

550
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:45,135
Nobody sits with me at lunch.

551
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:47,170
- What about Lauren?
- I missed too much school

552
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,438
because I'm sick all the time,

553
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,108
so she found other kids to sit with.

554
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,911
I don't have any friends there.

555
00:21:57,014 --> 00:21:59,134
But here I do.

556
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,178
So I want to stay here.

557
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:04,102
Nora, we'll be checking your labs

558
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:06,022
once you finish your insulin drip.

559
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:07,023
Once your labs stabilize...

560
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:08,936
I'll just drink more juice.

561
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,355
I don't want the surgery.

562
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,525
It's my body. I don't want it.

563
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:19,402
I taught her that. That it's her body.

564
00:22:19,437 --> 00:22:21,905
I'm not sure what to do here.

565
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:23,540
Eileen, can we talk?

566
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:25,976
Inpatient Services, 3343.

567
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,912
Inpatient Services, 3343.

568
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:30,514
I didn't know...

569
00:22:30,548 --> 00:22:32,249
I didn't know she hated school.

570
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:34,384
I didn't know she and Lauren
weren't friends anymore.

571
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:35,886
How did I not know?

572
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,921
Well, they reach an age
where they like to keep secrets,

573
00:22:37,955 --> 00:22:39,000
like to figure things out for themselves.

574
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:40,087
It's not on you.

575
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:41,992
I called Lauren a bitch once.

576
00:22:42,026 --> 00:22:44,928
Not to her face, but behind
her back, to my daughter,

577
00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:47,030
I called her 10-year-old
best friend a bitch

578
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:48,965
because she was being a bitch. To my kid.

579
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,702
And I wanted to protect her
and be on her side,

580
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:55,438
but maybe that's why Nora
doesn't talk to me anymore.

581
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:59,075
Maybe I wasn't supposed
to react, just listen.

582
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,178
But I'm not super great at that
historically, so...

583
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:03,380
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do now.

584
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:04,748
You're supposed
to make her get the surgery.

585
00:23:04,782 --> 00:23:06,616
- Today. Right now.
- DeLuca...

586
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,084
Every kid gets bullied at school.

587
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,554
Most kids hate school at some
point or another, right?

588
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:12,455
Are you saying I should hold her down...

589
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:13,649
- Yes.
- No, no, look,

590
00:23:13,674 --> 00:23:14,691
this is my patient, DeLuca...

591
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:15,926
I don't know Nora.

592
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,128
I'm not attached to whether she
has friends at school or not,

593
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:20,463
but I would like to see her not die.

594
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:22,265
She's not dying.

595
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,633
Oh, my God, what are you...

596
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,802
- DeLuca.
- Look, she's in pain, right?

597
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:27,637
Every time her pancreas flares up,

598
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,706
it's extremely painful for her.

599
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,107
She's getting this surgery for a reason,

600
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:32,375
so just make her get it.

601
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,610
Make her get the help that she needs.

602
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:35,278
Look, you are dismissed, Dr. DeLuca.

603
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,947
Walk away now.

604
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:38,915
Walk away now, or you're fired.

605
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:49,593
- I can't do this.
- Come on.

606
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:50,961
I can't. It's just... It's weird.

607
00:23:50,995 --> 00:23:52,162
I don't know how to explain it.
I mean, I can...

608
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:55,298
I can give her orders like...
like... like she's a soldier.

609
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,333
Are you serious?

610
00:23:56,367 --> 00:24:00,070
What? I'm good at that.
Th-This baby-talk thing...

611
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:01,304
it ... it just... I don't know.

612
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,410
It's not my thing.

613
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:06,076
It makes me feel... I don't know... shy.

614
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,644
Oh, I-I'll turn around.

615
00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:10,013
How about that?

616
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:12,816
Okay.

617
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,252
Hello.

618
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:16,753
Hi!

619
00:24:16,787 --> 00:24:18,788
Guten Tag. That's German.

620
00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:20,890
Technically, it means "good day," but...

621
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:23,760
I'm your mom.

622
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:25,230
But you probably already know that

623
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,237
'cause you're floating around inside me.

624
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:28,198
- I'm terrible at this. I can't... I...
- You're doing great.

625
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:29,599
No, I'm not. I'm... I'm terrible at it,

626
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,001
and I'm already failing as a mom.

627
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:32,535
I'm... I'm insufficient.

628
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,730
Teddy, that doesn't even make sense.

629
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,941
Look, and I'm sure
I caused whatever it was

630
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,207
that made her want to come out early.

631
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:40,043
I mean, I'm on my feet too long
and didn't drink enough water,

632
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:41,978
or probably forgot to take
a prenatal one day.

633
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,014
You know, now she's gonna
be born prematurely

634
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:46,149
with underdeveloped lungs and...

635
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:48,594
and low birth weight and no crib

636
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:50,053
and a... a terrified mom,

637
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:51,187
who, despite being a surgeon...

638
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:54,357
...knows crap about...
about taking care of babies...

639
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,725
What are you doing?

640
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,160
I...

641
00:24:57,194 --> 00:25:00,297
...am trying to show you
that you are not alone.

642
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:02,299
Or, at least I think I am.

643
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,634
- Hold on.
- Owen. Oh.

644
00:25:06,937 --> 00:25:08,038
Owen, you don't have to do this.

645
00:25:08,072 --> 00:25:10,040
Give me a minute.

646
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:11,875
Whew!

647
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:14,377
Whew! Oh, yeah.

648
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:22,686
All right, Helm, what are some other ways

649
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,555
that we could've prepared this vessel?

650
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:29,159
We could've done a vein patch
or a saphenous vein graft.

651
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:31,061
Her anasto...

652
00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:33,563
T-Their anastomosis looks good.

653
00:25:33,597 --> 00:25:35,899
Hm, see? That wasn't so hard, was it?

654
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:38,201
Well, yes, it was, as a matter of fact.

655
00:25:38,235 --> 00:25:41,104
It was wholly unnatural to my ear.

656
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:45,742
You know, I had a mechanic
who called me Ricky

657
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:48,845
no matter how many times I corrected him.

658
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:50,780
Best mechanic I ever had.

659
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,082
I fired him.

660
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:54,217
You fired a guy 'cause
he called you Ricky?

661
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:55,343
I'm not a Ricky.

662
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:57,787
That's kind of a false equivalent.

663
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:00,256
Comparing an annoying nickname
to misgendering...

664
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,792
I'm just saying that
I understand what it's like

665
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,728
when you're called something you aren't.

666
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:08,064
I've been called a lot worse than Ricky.

667
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,433
It's just... just that
the world moves fast,

668
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,236
and I'm... I'm trying to keep up,

669
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,671
and I'm trying to adjust,

670
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:16,695
and your attitude is not
helping the process.

671
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:20,710
I had a girlfriend call me Jackie once.

672
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,445
Did you break up with her?

673
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,315
Damn straight I did.

674
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:28,318
Dr. Karev, Nora's new
glucose panel came back.

675
00:26:28,352 --> 00:26:30,286
Ah, this is good.

676
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:32,789
This is good. And her
potassium level is down, too.

677
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:34,290
So we can do it?

678
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:36,493
I think we can
if we can talk her into it.

679
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:38,128
Dr. Fisher, call Cardio-Path Lab.

680
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:40,663
Dr. Fisher, call Cardio-Path Lab.

681
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:42,030
Damn it.

682
00:26:42,064 --> 00:26:43,233
You try to help a guy out a little,

683
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:44,768
and now I gotta fire him.

684
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:48,738
Yeah, you know, I was about your age

685
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,508
when I moved with my mom
from Italy to Wisconsin.

686
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:53,610
And they hated me.

687
00:26:53,644 --> 00:26:55,078
I could barely speak any English.

688
00:26:55,112 --> 00:26:57,914
They called me "DeLoser"
for two years straight.

689
00:26:57,948 --> 00:27:00,417
It was tough, but I got through it.

690
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:03,787
And trust me...
you are way cooler than I was.

691
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:05,021
Unh-unh.

692
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:07,257
And my hair... you gotta
see my hair, Nora.

693
00:27:08,396 --> 00:27:10,260
Look at this.

694
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:13,430
Hm?

695
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:14,697
Huh?

696
00:27:14,732 --> 00:27:16,166
That's me.

697
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,334
Believe me... that kid got bullied.

698
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:23,273
Nora, kids are mean, and
they're always gonna be mean.

699
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:26,176
But you can kick all their asses at math.

700
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,278
That makes you better than them.

701
00:27:28,312 --> 00:27:30,113
You're gonna find friends.

702
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:31,781
You already made a bunch here, right?

703
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,651
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, too.

704
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:36,653
We're all a bunch of nerds here.

705
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:38,688
And we like you a lot.

706
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,558
And you're gonna find more of us...

707
00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:43,228
I promise you.

708
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,939
You just got to push through.

709
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,832
So can you trust me?

710
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:50,366
And push through?

711
00:27:52,603 --> 00:27:54,532
Yeah? All right.

712
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,887
This jacket's hilarious.

713
00:27:56,921 --> 00:27:58,408
Hey, I still have that jacket.

714
00:28:08,602 --> 00:28:10,628
Pick-ups, please.

715
00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:13,698
You did a beautiful job
on that first laminectomy.

716
00:28:13,732 --> 00:28:17,134
Well, this one's tougher.
The vertebra is crushed.

717
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:19,070
This is the one that...
Let me see if I can ease if off.

718
00:28:19,104 --> 00:28:21,239
Careful. If it shifts even a little,

719
00:28:21,273 --> 00:28:22,707
she's in a wheelchair forever.

720
00:28:22,741 --> 00:28:24,775
Thanks for that.

721
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,311
- No pressure.
- Well, it's what it is.

722
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:29,747
And she's got that triathlon
with her kid.

723
00:28:29,781 --> 00:28:30,852
Good.

724
00:28:30,886 --> 00:28:34,085
Good. Good.

725
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,529
Okay, stop.

726
00:28:35,563 --> 00:28:37,032
That's enough.

727
00:28:37,756 --> 00:28:38,950
That's great.

728
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,285
Thank you.

729
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,976
Let me get that last bone fragment.

730
00:28:45,697 --> 00:28:48,799
All right, let's run
the potentials again, please?

731
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:50,134
See if she can walk.

732
00:28:50,168 --> 00:28:52,076
Strong motor and sensory

733
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:53,337
signals strength throughout.

734
00:28:53,372 --> 00:28:55,306
Okay, okay.

735
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,593
As soon as we get out of here,

736
00:28:56,627 --> 00:28:58,776
we're gonna reposition her
for the C5 repair.

737
00:29:03,548 --> 00:29:05,182
Qadri, what do you see?

738
00:29:05,217 --> 00:29:07,291
Areas of necrosis.

739
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:10,421
But I think we can find some
healthy islet cells in there.

740
00:29:12,624 --> 00:29:14,225
Kids are mean.

741
00:29:15,394 --> 00:29:16,661
I grew up in Utah.

742
00:29:16,695 --> 00:29:18,329
I was the only non-Mormon in my school.

743
00:29:18,363 --> 00:29:21,020
They put a garter snake in my backpack.

744
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:22,867
I was fat.

745
00:29:22,901 --> 00:29:24,468
I was me.

746
00:29:24,503 --> 00:29:25,703
That would be hard.

747
00:29:26,894 --> 00:29:29,549
Dr. Karev, nobody told me
you were starting.

748
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,642
No one needed to.
You're not on this case.

749
00:29:33,712 --> 00:29:35,680
I'm the reason she consented
to this surgery.

750
00:29:35,714 --> 00:29:37,601
After I told you to stay away from her.

751
00:29:37,635 --> 00:29:38,683
I meant what I said, DeLuca.

752
00:29:38,717 --> 00:29:40,451
I don't want you anywhere near this.

753
00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:43,888
I mean it. Get out.

754
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,664
- Can you get...
- This little bit right there?

755
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:56,485
Thank you.

756
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,868
I don't know how you do it.

757
00:29:57,903 --> 00:29:59,870
- Do what?
- Neuro.

758
00:29:59,905 --> 00:30:01,104
This much pressure?

759
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:02,974
Brains and spines, life and death,

760
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,542
every time you set foot in an OR.

761
00:30:04,576 --> 00:30:05,743
I'd go crazy.

762
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:08,989
Well, adrenaline's the only high
I let myself have anymore.

763
00:30:09,023 --> 00:30:10,982
I'm saying it's impressive.

764
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,025
We're losing the signal

765
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,553
to both her upper and lower extremities.

766
00:30:15,587 --> 00:30:16,620
What? Why?

767
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:17,952
Did you nick something
when we removed the disk?

768
00:30:17,992 --> 00:30:20,057
No, I wasn't anywhere near it.
Neither were you.

769
00:30:20,092 --> 00:30:21,359
Okay, why are we losing signal like that?

770
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:23,194
I-Is there residual disk? Penfield 4!

771
00:30:23,228 --> 00:30:24,243
Now they're gone completely.

772
00:30:24,277 --> 00:30:25,429
Is her blood pressure dropping off?

773
00:30:25,464 --> 00:30:26,468
Is she getting her fluids?

774
00:30:26,503 --> 00:30:27,865
Her blood pressure has been stable.

775
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:29,934
This makes no sense.
Recheck the signal, please.

776
00:30:29,968 --> 00:30:32,036
Negative. No response in arms or legs.

777
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,237
All of it? It's all gone?

778
00:30:33,271 --> 00:30:35,506
- Give her 1,200 milligrams of Solu-Medrol.
- On it!

779
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,907
She lost all of it?

780
00:30:36,942 --> 00:30:38,776
Arms and legs? All of it?

781
00:30:42,428 --> 00:30:44,181
You look like you're about to throw up.

782
00:30:44,216 --> 00:30:45,340
Oh, I'm not.

783
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:48,085
You're actually turning green.

784
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,887
- You should get down.
- Nope.

785
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:51,956
Gesture appreciated,

786
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,624
but you don't have to suffer with me...

787
00:30:53,658 --> 00:30:54,792
Yes, I do.

788
00:30:54,826 --> 00:30:57,047
I'm in this with you. And her.

789
00:30:57,829 --> 00:30:59,964
We're in this together. We're a family.

790
00:30:59,998 --> 00:31:02,133
Every step of the way, okay?

791
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:04,402
I know you're scared.

792
00:31:04,436 --> 00:31:05,870
I am, too.

793
00:31:05,904 --> 00:31:07,668
At least you know what to do.
You have Leo.

794
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,775
Last night, I put
Leo's diaper on backwards,

795
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:11,833
and he peed the bed.

796
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:13,377
Poor guy had to sleep in wet sheets.

797
00:31:13,412 --> 00:31:16,547
Yeah. I mean, we just do the best we can.

798
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:18,482
It's all we can do.

799
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:22,753
Hey.

800
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:28,259
Your mom... she's better than the best.

801
00:31:28,293 --> 00:31:31,262
She's incredibly kind and hilarious,

802
00:31:31,296 --> 00:31:32,492
and she's so strong.

803
00:31:32,526 --> 00:31:35,499
I remember... I saw her do a thoracotomy

804
00:31:35,534 --> 00:31:37,601
in a helicopter that had no doors,

805
00:31:37,636 --> 00:31:39,336
and that patient lived, yeah.

806
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:41,405
Yeah.

807
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,908
She listens to Duran
Duran way too loud...

808
00:31:43,942 --> 00:31:45,843
...and she can take down
an entire pizza on her own,

809
00:31:45,877 --> 00:31:47,445
which I find insanely charming.

810
00:31:48,847 --> 00:31:52,783
She is loyal, and she is fierce, and...

811
00:31:54,052 --> 00:31:57,721
...she would lay upside-down
for weeks if you needed her to.

812
00:31:58,857 --> 00:32:00,424
You'll never turn around

813
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:02,793
and not have her standing
right behind you,

814
00:32:02,828 --> 00:32:04,728
holding you up, okay?

815
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:08,432
So, little one, you do not have to worry.

816
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:11,869
Your mom has got this.

817
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:15,172
Owen.

818
00:32:19,878 --> 00:32:21,679
Well, this is cozy.

819
00:32:21,713 --> 00:32:23,447
Hey, hi. Hi, Tom.

820
00:32:23,482 --> 00:32:24,782
Hey, Tom.

821
00:32:24,816 --> 00:32:27,017
God, is, uh, she okay?

822
00:32:27,052 --> 00:32:28,064
Are you okay? How's the peanut?

823
00:32:28,098 --> 00:32:29,320
- She's fine. She's fine.
- Yeah?

824
00:32:29,354 --> 00:32:31,956
Just, apparently, I have cervix issues,

825
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,991
and hopefully not anymore after today.

826
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:35,893
Thanks for the update, Hunt.

827
00:32:35,927 --> 00:32:37,461
Sorry, I-I didn't want to worry

828
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:39,063
any more people than I needed to.

829
00:32:39,097 --> 00:32:41,031
No, I-I'm glad I'm here.

830
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:42,967
Listen, I'll, um, go get a coffee

831
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:44,301
and check on a patient.
Do you need anything?

832
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:45,903
No, good. We're good.

833
00:32:45,937 --> 00:32:47,071
Hey, hey, give me one second, okay?

834
00:32:47,105 --> 00:32:48,283
Yeah.

835
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:52,009
So...

836
00:32:52,043 --> 00:32:53,811
I-I'm curious.

837
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:56,881
Uh, if Teddy had been in actual labor,

838
00:32:56,915 --> 00:32:57,982
would you have told me then?

839
00:32:58,016 --> 00:33:00,339
Or would you still have let me
stay in that class?

840
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:02,153
W... She wasn't in labor,
so what does it matter?

841
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:04,688
Okay. Here we go.

842
00:33:06,024 --> 00:33:07,709
I know you don't like me.

843
00:33:07,743 --> 00:33:08,826
Trust me, I'm not losing sleep over it,

844
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,561
but if you plan to make a play here?

845
00:33:10,595 --> 00:33:12,496
If you're gonna show up with a ring

846
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:15,900
and take advantage of the very
old pain and vulnerability

847
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:19,537
of a woman you have over and
over again hurt and abandoned...

848
00:33:19,571 --> 00:33:21,105
please rethink that.

849
00:33:21,139 --> 00:33:23,674
Because I will not lie down,

850
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:26,243
and I will not walk away.

851
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:27,864
I'll fight for her.

852
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:30,748
And that'll bring on
a whole lot of drama and pain

853
00:33:30,782 --> 00:33:34,051
for the woman you claim
you just want to be happy.

854
00:33:34,085 --> 00:33:35,920
You don't know anything
about my history with Teddy.

855
00:33:35,954 --> 00:33:38,005
- Your history with Teddy...
- Yeah.

856
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,690
...is you chose Amelia.

857
00:33:39,724 --> 00:33:41,125
More than once.

858
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,630
My history is, I love Teddy.

859
00:33:44,763 --> 00:33:46,931
I mean, I'm in love with her.

860
00:33:46,965 --> 00:33:49,233
And only her.

861
00:33:49,267 --> 00:33:50,901
And she deserves to be with someone

862
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:55,139
for whom she is
the first and the only choice.

863
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:09,163
Is she okay? Can I see her?

864
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:12,042
She's not awake yet, Toby.

865
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:16,746
Your mom...

866
00:34:17,915 --> 00:34:20,350
suffered an injury to her cervical spine.

867
00:34:21,452 --> 00:34:24,321
Her cord swelled in surgery.

868
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:26,390
We did everything that we could,

869
00:34:26,424 --> 00:34:29,726
but she is paralyzed from the neck down.

870
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,834
Oh, my God.

871
00:34:33,868 --> 00:34:36,333
She's still here.

872
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:37,668
She's still your mom.

873
00:34:38,947 --> 00:34:41,238
She's gonna need a lot of help from you,

874
00:34:41,272 --> 00:34:43,273
from your family.

875
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,811
I can't. I'm not...

876
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:53,016
She's the one.

877
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:55,497
- She's the one with the...
- All the answers.

878
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:58,989
Yeah, I have the same mom.

879
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:03,326
The smart, strong, fearless mom

880
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:04,661
who always has more sense than you.

881
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:06,296
Yeah, I know it very well.

882
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:11,134
I have, um...

883
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,503
learned that it's now...

884
00:35:14,872 --> 00:35:16,139
...now, when she's the one that's hurt,

885
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:18,475
when she's the one that needs you...

886
00:35:19,877 --> 00:35:21,511
...that's when you realize
that she's already

887
00:35:21,546 --> 00:35:23,480
given you all that you need.

888
00:35:26,684 --> 00:35:29,778
You've got it. You're strong
and fearless already.

889
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:31,752
She already showed you how.

890
00:35:33,491 --> 00:35:35,074
So...

891
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:38,328
don't let her down.

892
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,167
Can I be there?

893
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,421
When she wakes up?

894
00:35:53,244 --> 00:35:54,578
This is Jo. Leave a message!

895
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:56,346
Hey, hey. I just, uh...

896
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,348
I wanted to see
if you were still on the plane.

897
00:35:58,382 --> 00:36:01,151
I just... I can't wait
to hear how it went.

898
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:03,553
Look, I'm not some intern

899
00:36:03,588 --> 00:36:04,639
you can kick around anymore, all right?

900
00:36:04,674 --> 00:36:05,840
What you did today was unprofessional.

901
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:08,058
No, what you did today
was unprofessional.

902
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:09,330
The way you helped out Nora...

903
00:36:09,364 --> 00:36:10,927
that should have been
the first thing you did.

904
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:12,763
But you're too pissed
at the world about your dad.

905
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:15,198
And believe me, I know what a
number our parents can do on us.

906
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:16,867
But you let it mess with your job today.

907
00:36:16,901 --> 00:36:19,035
And with my patient's
really excellent mom.

908
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,704
And it's messing with your relationship.

909
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:22,546
My relationship? What
does it have to do with that?

910
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,508
No, don't let it. Just don't.

911
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,576
When people reach out a hand,
you don't bite it.

912
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:27,904
I did it for years.

913
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:30,680
The only thing it gets you
is they stop reaching out.

914
00:36:36,454 --> 00:36:38,255
Hey.

915
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:39,623
What were your numbers this morning?

916
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:40,857
Because if this is you relaxing,

917
00:36:40,892 --> 00:36:42,626
I'm gonna have to have you admitted.

918
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,807
Oh. _

919
00:36:44,832 --> 00:36:47,531
Oh, well, maybe
there are outside factors.

920
00:36:47,565 --> 00:36:49,232
Huh?

921
00:36:49,267 --> 00:36:51,234
Just do it again. Do it again.

922
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:53,036
Is your, um, heart pounding?

923
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,571
Your pulse racing?

924
00:36:54,605 --> 00:36:55,906
I'm not 13.

925
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,276
Oho, oh. It never ends.

926
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:06,817
Did you read that? That's huge!

927
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:09,335
- Hey.
- Hi.

928
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:11,154
Everything is okay.

929
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:12,255
Thank you.

930
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,557
Yeah.

931
00:37:22,466 --> 00:37:23,869
If only life's variables

932
00:37:23,903 --> 00:37:27,137
were as cut and dried
as the rules of mathematics.

933
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:30,052
Hey.

934
00:37:30,087 --> 00:37:31,857
Is this part of your study?

935
00:37:31,892 --> 00:37:35,145
Hm? Uh... Uh, yeah.

936
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:36,980
This, too?

937
00:37:37,014 --> 00:37:38,782
Oh, no. This... This is, um...

938
00:37:38,816 --> 00:37:40,617
This is a little trigonometry

939
00:37:40,651 --> 00:37:42,285
mixed with a little calculus

940
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,920
mixed with a little logic.

941
00:37:43,955 --> 00:37:45,522
It is the stuff of nightmares.

942
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:46,590
It's...

943
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,124
17.

944
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,794
Please.

945
00:37:50,828 --> 00:37:52,929
If only there were clear answers.

946
00:37:55,499 --> 00:37:57,467
17.

947
00:37:57,501 --> 00:37:59,436
Certainty. Clarity.

948
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,604
Right or wrong.

949
00:38:00,638 --> 00:38:02,221
I want you to know...

950
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:04,941
I will never, ever forgive you for that.

951
00:38:06,377 --> 00:38:07,611
I'm okay with that.

952
00:39:05,536 --> 00:39:07,604
But all you can do is eliminate
as many unknowns as possible..

953
00:39:09,073 --> 00:39:10,196
- Hey.
- Hi.

954
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,147
- I'm talking first.
- Okay.

955
00:39:15,182 --> 00:39:17,280
I'm talking first because

956
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:18,882
I don't do sitting at work

957
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:20,850
wondering whether my boyfriend
is avoiding me...

958
00:39:20,885 --> 00:39:22,752
...or being weird to me.

959
00:39:22,787 --> 00:39:26,356
It's just... I'm past
that point in my life.

960
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,692
I'm not interested in it.
I have no time for it.

961
00:39:28,726 --> 00:39:30,914
I know. I ran out of minutes.

962
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:33,630
What?

963
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:34,965
The thing with my dad.

964
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:37,881
I-I can't fix him, I can't help him,

965
00:39:37,915 --> 00:39:39,536
and I...

966
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,805
couldn't believe how much that hurt.

967
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,306
And I needed a minute to be hurt.

968
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,642
I didn't want to drag you down with me.

969
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:48,411
I needed a minute, all right?

970
00:39:48,446 --> 00:39:49,738
But now...

971
00:39:51,983 --> 00:39:55,452
Now I just need you.

972
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,122
Well, maybe I need a minute now.

973
00:39:59,156 --> 00:40:02,759
Do you?

974
00:40:02,793 --> 00:40:04,828
- Do you really, though?
- Maybe.

975
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:06,730
I want to say yes.

976
00:40:06,764 --> 00:40:08,898
Maybe I do.

977
00:40:22,847 --> 00:40:24,981
- Did you make that?
- Yeah.

978
00:40:27,018 --> 00:40:28,785
You cook and you speak Italian?

979
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:31,301
You hungry?

980
00:40:31,302 --> 00:40:32,955
I'm starving.

981
00:40:36,394 --> 00:40:39,095
Well, have a seat, and prepare
to have your mind blown.

982
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,098
- Really? Wow, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

983
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:46,636
Then pick an answer and hope..

984
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,277
Jo?

985
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,781
Jo, you asleep?

986
00:41:10,394 --> 00:41:12,128
I missed you.

987
00:41:24,842 --> 00:41:26,709
Hope that, at the end of the day,

988
00:41:26,744 --> 00:41:28,344
it's an answer you can live with.

989
00:41:29,305 --> 00:41:35,797

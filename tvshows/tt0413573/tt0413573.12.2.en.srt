1
00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:03,230
The body has approximately
eleven organ systems

2
00:00:03,231 --> 00:00:06,399
all doing different things
at the same time.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,477
In order to keep us functioning
or, well, alive,

4
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:14,527
they need one voice,
a leader, a master,

5
00:00:14,528 --> 00:00:18,328
and, in our brains, that job
belongs to the pituitary gland.

6
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:21,487
<i>It senses the body's needs
before they even arise,</i>

7
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,148
<i>working non-stop.</i>

8
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:26,195
The pituitary gland communicates
with all of the other glands,

9
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:28,060
telling them when to produce

10
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,029
the vital hormones
we need to function.

11
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:32,421
<i>It keeps everything
running smoothly,</i>

12
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:34,310
<i>in perfect order.</i>

13
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:35,827
- You want a muffin?
- No, no.

14
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:37,352
Go, go!

15
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:39,015
<i>There's no denying it,</i>

16
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:41,828
<i>it has the toughest job
in the place.</i>

"candy disco rainbows."

21
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:01,846

22

Oh, no, no. Go on.
Uh, you can't be late for rounds.

159
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:35,920
(Chuckling)
I was traveling.

160
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:36,921
I am run down.

161
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:37,989
You can be run down in the bubble,

162
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,191
look, we don't know what you have.

163
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:41,926
We don't know how contagious you are.

164
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:43,695
Hey, this is my first
day running this place.

165
00:05:43,696 --> 00:05:45,930
There will be no epidemics today.

166
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:48,099
What did infectious disease say?

167
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,768
Uh, well, as of now,
her symptoms are nonspecific,

168
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:52,437
but they want to rule out Anthrax.

169
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:53,838
Any concerns about MERS?

170
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,039
Oh, God. You think?

171
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,307
I'm right here.

172
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:59,277
And you will stay right there
until your tests come back.

173
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:01,479
This stops with patient zero.

174
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,047
I am not patient zero.

175
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:04,716
I'm not a patient at all.

176
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:05,717
Goodbye, Kepner.

177
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:07,285
Do not cross that line.

178
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:08,619
Stay in the bubble.

179
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,155
- I cannot...
- In the bubble.

180
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:13,191
I will visit you, I promise.

181
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:15,692
(Footsteps depart)

182
00:06:18,697 --> 00:06:21,598
May I see it... the rash?

183
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,439
(Sighs)

184
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:33,811
It's nothing, right?

185
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:35,847
I'll keep my eye out for your labs.

186
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:37,014
Okay.

187
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:38,982
But, uh, maybe we can talk if...

188
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,057
Look, I'm saying we should page neuro.

189
00:06:46,058 --> 00:06:47,258
Why?

190
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:48,559
Her vitals her stable,
her bloodwork's normal,

191
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,862
we sewed up her head lac...
She's obviously fine.

192
00:06:50,863 --> 00:06:52,230
Fine, you discharge her.

193
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:53,598
- Discharge who?
- Hi, chief.

194
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,065
Her.

195
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:03,408
Uh... "Jade Bell."

196
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:04,976
Hello. I'm Dr. Bailey.

197
00:07:04,977 --> 00:07:06,611
Oh, good. More doctors.

198
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:08,579
ANDREW: The patient complained
of a headache and blurry vision

199
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,947
before she fainted and hit her head,

200
00:07:09,948 --> 00:07:12,817
so I did a complete syncope work-up,
which was negative.

201
00:07:12,818 --> 00:07:14,285
So... What? That led you to...

202
00:07:14,286 --> 00:07:16,487
- Sew up her head lac.
- What is her diagnosis?

203
00:07:16,488 --> 00:07:17,555
Hypoglycemia?

204
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:18,890
She probably just
forgot to eat breakfast?

205
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:20,858
Wrong. You, what did this one miss?

206
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:23,428
Beta HCG...
Could you be pregnant?

207
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:24,495
Not a chance.

208
00:07:24,496 --> 00:07:26,664
Look, I was in a meeting, I felt dizzy,

209
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:27,999
and I woke up here,
but I feel fine now.

210
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,600
- Can I go?
- No, you cannot.

211
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:31,568
- What... are... you... missing?
- (Jade sighs)

212
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:34,572
- Migrant variant.
- Autonomic dysfunction.

213
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:37,341
This is really, really fun,
but I have a work deadline so...

214
00:07:37,342 --> 00:07:40,144
- Uh, Jade, stand up for me, please.
- What?

215
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:41,145
Stand up, please.

216
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:45,116
We didn't miss anything.

217
00:07:45,117 --> 00:07:47,083
♪

218
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,092
Hi. Freak show's over. Can I go?

219
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:56,194
Whoa.

220
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:57,894

I feel naked.

223
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:16,376
That nurse Betsy...
her name was Betsy...

224
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:19,379
she took my clothes, took them,
sealed them in plastic.

225
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,081
She took all of my clothes.

226
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:22,649
I have on paper panties!

227
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,584
You know how paper panties feel?

228
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:26,453
I imagine that there's some chafing.

229

(Sighs)

230
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:28,588
Okay.

231
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:30,657
Listen, it's a chance to relax,

232
00:08:30,658 --> 00:08:33,560
so you should take a nap and
get rid of your jet lag or read.

233
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:35,762
It's like a spa or a vacation.

234
00:08:35,763 --> 00:08:38,632
I am in a bubble!
I am trapped in a bubble!

235
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,967
Jackson... he came in once.

236
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:43,904
He came in once, took a look at me,
and then just walked away,

237
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:47,140
and... and I couldn't go after him
because the bubble does not travel.

238
00:08:47,141 --> 00:08:48,175
No, it does not.

239
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:50,243
I am alone in here.

240
00:08:50,244 --> 00:08:54,815
I am trapped like a bug,
like some kind of nasty bug,

241
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:57,184
and I'm covered in disease.

242
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:59,319
You would think that he
would <i>want</i> to talk to me.

243
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,688
I am gonna die of a mysterious disease

244
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:04,357
with a chafed, buggy ass all alone!

245
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:07,127
Oh. Oh, my God. Don't freak out.

246
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:09,096
You've been in here
for like an hour.

247
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:10,763
It's not that. It's Jackson.

248
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:18,271
How can I help?

249
00:09:18,272 --> 00:09:20,207
Um, just, uh, talk.

250
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,510
Talk about something else...
Anything.

251
00:09:23,511 --> 00:09:25,112
Okay. Um, okay.

252
00:09:25,113 --> 00:09:27,881
Um... Yeah, oh. Here's the thing.

253
00:09:27,882 --> 00:09:31,118
Um, Callie met someone.

254
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:34,221
Oh.

255
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:35,222
Um...

256
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:37,290
So, are you okay with that, or...

257
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,859
Yeah, super. Awesome.

258
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,460
Okay, that's...
that's great, then.

259
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:42,129
Yeah, I mean,
I should be happy for her, right?

260
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,197
And she sounds happy, you know,
happier than she's <i>ever</i> been,

261
00:09:44,198 --> 00:09:48,568
she says... I mean, apparently,
like, forever happy.

262
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:49,803
Do we have to talk about <i>this?</i>

263
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:50,904
Well, you know, she does,

264
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:53,172
'cause she's talking
to everybody about it.

265
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:56,743
ISAAC:
I'm surprised she fit.

266
00:09:56,744 --> 00:09:59,279
20 bucks she's over 7 feet.

267
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,349
I mean, is it drugs or the wrong
combo of steroids, you think?

268
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,683
I saw Lebron at an airport once.

269
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:04,684
She's taller than him.

270
00:10:04,685 --> 00:10:07,154
Be quiet and stand outside.

271
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:08,287
(Sighs)

272
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:11,758
Do we think it's drugs?

273
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,593
A growth hormone, maybe?

274
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:15,562
It's definitely not drugs.

275
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:17,197
Waiting for a scan to confirm it.

276
00:10:17,198 --> 00:10:18,765
Yeah, oh, I'm right. You'll see.

277
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,534
Oh, and just 'cause you're chief now,

278
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:22,502
- you're knower of all things?
- (Scoffs)

279
00:10:22,503 --> 00:10:27,007
Look, Jade suffers from blurry
vision, headaches, dizziness.

280
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:28,708
Abnormal growth.

281
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:31,745
(Stammers) Okay, put it all together,
and you get...?

282
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:33,413
A pituitary tumor.

283
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:36,016
The knower of all things!
(Laughs)

284
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:38,218
I should be chief of surgery.

285
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:40,687
Oh, wait... I already am.

286
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:41,788
(Laughs)

287
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:43,856
You are welcome.

288
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:48,995
(Sighs)
Where have you been?

289
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:51,965
I was downloading all
the charts you asked for,

290
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:53,767
which, respectfully,
is a lot of charts.

291
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:55,902
Are we really doing all
of these surgeries today?

292
00:10:55,903 --> 00:10:57,904
Well, Bailey pushed all
her patients onto me,

293
00:10:57,905 --> 00:10:59,573
so that means you, too.

294
00:10:59,574 --> 00:11:01,441
Kyle Roane...
can we push this lap chole...

295
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:03,310
No, we don't have
his liver tests back yet.

296
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:04,711
(Sighs)
What about Dana Lee?

297
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:06,446
Hernia repair... Do we have
the urinalysis, because...

298
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:09,249
- No, the labs are backed up.
- I don't have time for this.

299
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,087
Is there anything I can do
to make your day better, Dr. Grey?

300
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:17,257
I'm sorry. I just...

301
00:11:17,258 --> 00:11:19,726
I can't say no to Bailey
because it's for the chief,

302
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:22,095
so I just need a little
break in the clouds here.

303
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:24,898
I just need a little rain.

304
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,032
(Sighs)

305
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:28,767
I appreciate the apology.

306
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:31,838
Where are you going?

307
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,007
To make it rain.

308
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:37,677
(Sighs)

309
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:40,679
- Thanks.
- (Indistinct conversations)

310
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:44,517
Dr. Wilson. You paged?

311
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:45,886
No, I didn't.

312
00:11:45,887 --> 00:11:47,721
Oh, wow, that's weird.
Totally thought you did.

313
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:48,822
Maybe this thing is old.

314
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:50,223
Anyway, you waiting for your labs?

315
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:51,658
Can I, uh, can I wait...

316
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:52,726
Oh, thank you, yeah.

317
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:53,860
Bring me the labs when you get them.

318
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:56,196
Oh, no, no, I meant wait...

00:17:57,818 --> 00:17:59,519
so I could handle her patients.

477
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,454
She didn't ask.
She just pushed them.

478
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,823
It's ridiculous. No offense.

479
00:18:03,824 --> 00:18:05,225
- MAGGIE: Can she do that?
- OWEN: Can who do what?

480
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:07,460
Oh, can you be chief again?
I loved you as chief.

481
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:11,097
- You did stay out of people's hair.
- Very hands-off and great ties.

482

You know what they used
to call her, her interns?

- What?
- The Nazi.

- OWEN: Bailey?
- Mm-hmm.

485
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,571
Last time she had
absolute rule over people,

486
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:21,875
- and here she is again.
- I love Bailey, but power corrupts.

487
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:24,377
- She's an iron-fisted dictator.
- She's a Bond villain.

for the small bowel obstruction

496

and an angio suite
for the Swanson case.

Oh, yeah.

whenever you get to it or...?

512
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:35,213
- Um, I like to do it hourly.
- Sweet. I like that.

513

You like what?

514
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:40,086
Hourly.

515
00:19:40,087 --> 00:19:41,621
It's, uh... it's just...

516
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:43,957
it's like it's a good, round time frame,

517
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,192
and there's one every hour,
so you don't forget to...

518
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:48,261
I don't know why I said that.

519

- That was really weak...
- Mm-hmm.

520

- Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm.

- Whoa, where you going?

522
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:57,604

- No, no, no. You can't leave.

asking for is completely unreasonable.

00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:26,302
(Sighs)

630
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:28,671
Did I push too hard?

631
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,638
(Sighs)

632
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:31,674
Uh, do you think I'm wrong here?

633
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:33,542
What do <i>you</i> think?

634
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:38,314
I think I have put us all
in a terrible position.

635
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:40,249
Yeah, well, I think you're right.

636
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,252
And I'm in one, too,
so can I just... work, please?

637
00:24:54,898 --> 00:24:56,432
(Sighs)

638
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:57,867
(Indistinct conversations)

639
00:24:57,868 --> 00:25:00,636
So check the urine output
and page me with any changes.

640
00:25:00,637 --> 00:25:01,769
On it.

641
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:04,306
Busy day.

642
00:25:04,307 --> 00:25:08,410
Has Bailey talked to you
about anything?

643
00:25:08,411 --> 00:25:11,180
Talk? All she does
is talk to me or at me.

644
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:13,582
She dumped her entire schedule on me

645
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:15,618
and expects me to get it all done today.

646
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:17,820
Yeah, I've been hearing that.

647
00:25:17,821 --> 00:25:19,955
The only reason
I'm holding up is Edwards.

648
00:25:19,956 --> 00:25:21,490
I mean, she's on top of it.

649
00:25:21,491 --> 00:25:25,260
I understand why Amelia requests her.
Edwards gets things done.

650
00:25:26,696 --> 00:25:29,498
CALLIE:
Bone graft is in. And...

651
00:25:29,499 --> 00:25:30,799
Yeah, we're done.

652
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,434
Warren, ease down on the retractor.

653
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:34,103
Got it.

654
00:25:34,104 --> 00:25:35,871
Shepherd, how are we?

655
00:25:35,872 --> 00:25:37,573
If I can get in a little further,
the margins will be close to perfect.

656
00:25:37,574 --> 00:25:39,675
Hold on.
Can you advance the scope?

657
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:41,210
- WARREN: Mm-hmm.
- (Monitor beeping rapidly)

658
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:42,311
- Damn it.
- What the hell happened?

659
00:25:42,312 --> 00:25:44,580
AMELIA: We hit the carotid.
I can't see a thing. Avery, suction.

660
00:25:44,581 --> 00:25:45,595
Uh, how can we help?

661
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:47,616
We need to compress this artery.
Wilson, we need more packing in here now.

662
00:25:47,617 --> 00:25:49,985
- Set up another suction.
- JO: Blood's coming out of her mouth.

663
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:50,986
God, she's gonna bleed out.

664
00:25:50,987 --> 00:25:53,255
We should've opened her skull.
I knew this would happen!

665
00:25:53,256 --> 00:25:55,824
JACKSON: Just keep packing... faster.
Come on! Pack! More!

666
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:58,794
- JO: Pressure's down to 85.
- Try 5% Albumin.

667
00:25:58,795 --> 00:26:00,729
- Pressure's down to 75.
- More suction.

668
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,831
I still can't see a thing.

669
00:26:02,832 --> 00:26:05,199
(Indistinct talking)

670
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,913
Oh, hey, Bailey.

671
00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:19,748
So, your adenoma resection
had a rebleed.

672
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:21,083
It's stable now.

673
00:26:21,084 --> 00:26:22,685
But then Mrs. What's Her Name
with the lap chole...

674
00:26:22,686 --> 00:26:25,955
- Grey, I can't right now.
- Bailey, these are your patients!

675
00:26:25,956 --> 00:26:27,590
Look, I-I'm happy you're chief.

676
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:29,024
I'm all for it.

677
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:31,193
But I am taking my day to
service your patients and mine,

678
00:26:31,194 --> 00:26:32,928
and it's getting done.
I'm on it.

679
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:35,097
But if you're gonna do this to me,
if you're gonna drown me,

680
00:26:35,098 --> 00:26:38,033
at least take two seconds to listen
to the update of <i>your</i> patients.

681
00:26:38,034 --> 00:26:39,902
I deserve more than to be dismissed.

682
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:41,836
I deserve more.

683
00:26:43,406 --> 00:26:45,841
Respectfully, chief.

684
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:55,010
- MAGGIE: Chest tube is in.
- CALLIE: Guys, is there a plan here?

685
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:56,410
Because she's lost
a third of her blood volume.

686
00:26:56,411 --> 00:26:58,546
JACKSON: I can do a muscle patch.
With a little glue, it could form a clot,

687
00:26:58,547 --> 00:26:59,718
- and we can seal the vessel.
- Will that even work?

688
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,882
No, that's a temporary fix.
We need to open her neck

689
00:27:01,883 --> 00:27:02,850
and do a primary repair
of the carotid...

690
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:05,169
- That's a major stroke risk.
- Before she dies on the table.

691
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,942
- Wilson, prep the neck.
- Wilson, you keep suctioning.

692
00:27:06,943 --> 00:27:08,890
- Who am I listening to?
- You need to listen to me!

693
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:10,090
You open her neck,
she's gonna bleed out in seconds.

694
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:11,425
You let me do this,

695
00:27:11,426 --> 00:27:12,893
I can stop the bleeding and
help you remove the tumor.

696
00:27:12,894 --> 00:27:15,404
- Do not open her neck, please.
- (Monitor beeping rapidly)

697
00:27:16,908 --> 00:27:18,141
Move.

698
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:22,002
All right, we can use a patch
from the thoracotomy incision.

699
00:27:22,003 --> 00:27:23,903
Pierce, I need a piece of
intercostal muscle right now, please.

00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:00,153
- and you're gonna talk to me.
- You don't want to hear it.

786
00:31:00,154 --> 00:31:02,255
- Jackson, I...
- We already talked, April.

787
00:31:02,256 --> 00:31:04,491
I told you what I needed,
and you didn't hear it.

788
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:05,492
You didn't listen.

789
00:31:05,493 --> 00:31:07,193
You went halfway
around the damn world.

790
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:08,495
That wasn't a talk, Jackson.

791
00:31:08,496 --> 00:31:10,196
That was an ultimatum,
and our marriage

792
00:31:10,197 --> 00:31:12,735
- has never been a marriage of ultimatums.
- Oh, come on. It wasn't an ultimatum.

793
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:16,336
- I gave you a choice.
- No.

794
00:31:16,337 --> 00:31:19,539
No, I made a choice long before that,

795
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,174
long before Samuel,

796
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:23,576
the army, any of it, and so did you.

797
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:24,777
We stood up

798
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:27,413
in that weird-smelling
little chapel in Tahoe,

799
00:31:27,414 --> 00:31:30,683
and before God,
we chose to love one another

800
00:31:30,684 --> 00:31:31,784
until we die.

801
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:33,019
You made that choice.

802
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,420
We chose to love
and honor one another...

803
00:31:34,421 --> 00:31:37,615
- In front of God...
- 'Cause you couldn't hear me

804
00:31:37,616 --> 00:31:40,460
- telling you that I needed you to stay.
- I needed to go!

805
00:31:40,461 --> 00:31:41,628
And you went!

806
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:44,664
You did what you needed to do...
twice, actually.

807
00:31:44,665 --> 00:31:47,867
This marriage is <i>full</i> of ultimatums.

808
00:31:47,868 --> 00:31:49,902
They're <i>all</i> yours.

809
00:31:54,174 --> 00:31:55,608
Look, we...

810
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:58,644
We've been through a lot.

811
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:01,881
And you've changed.

812
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:05,051
No.

813
00:32:05,052 --> 00:32:07,420
I've... I've grown.

814
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:08,521
And...

815
00:32:08,522 --> 00:32:09,622
(Sighs)

816
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:12,926
We haven't <i>been</i> through a lot.

817
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:17,230
Jackson, we're <i>going</i>
through a lot right now.

818
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:20,533
We're <i>going</i> through a hard part.

819
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:26,372
This is... this is the worse of
"for better or worse."

820
00:32:26,373 --> 00:32:28,474
This is the mud,

821
00:32:28,475 --> 00:32:31,878
and we just have to pull
each other through it.

822
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:35,414
We just... we have to push,
and we have to fight.

823
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:41,119
I'm not sure we <i>are</i>
worth fighting for.

824
00:32:43,824 --> 00:32:44,890
What?

825
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:47,694
No, please don't...

826
00:32:47,695 --> 00:32:49,996
Aah!

827
00:32:49,997 --> 00:32:51,430
Ow! God!

828
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:56,435
(Crying)

829
00:33:10,584 --> 00:33:12,451
(Sighs)

830
00:33:12,452 --> 00:33:14,286
♪

831
00:33:25,532 --> 00:33:27,332
Okay.

832
00:33:31,772 --> 00:33:34,039
So, where are we with Jade?

833
00:33:35,075 --> 00:33:38,044
I got the whole tumor.

834
00:33:38,045 --> 00:33:42,315
She had a... bad left carotid bleed.

835
00:33:42,316 --> 00:33:44,684
I took her to angio, put in a stent.

836
00:33:44,685 --> 00:33:47,053
But she's likely to have deficits...

837
00:33:47,054 --> 00:33:49,155
possibly a stroke, paralysis...

838
00:33:49,156 --> 00:33:50,222
She's still out.

839
00:33:50,223 --> 00:33:52,639
- Speech and language issues, vision loss.
- Pressure's good, but we won't know.

840
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,727
Or she could just be in a coma.

841
00:34:02,102 --> 00:34:04,269
You people are extraordinary.

842
00:34:06,506 --> 00:34:13,480
I mean, I came in here today
and did all kinds of things wrong,

843
00:34:14,214 --> 00:34:15,815
but in spite of that,

844
00:34:15,816 --> 00:34:21,487
you all still did
amazing and perfect work.

845
00:34:21,488 --> 00:34:25,024
And you found a way to do something

846
00:34:25,025 --> 00:34:26,492
that was, in fact, impossible.

847
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:33,164
So if there is a bad outcome,
it's my bad outcome.

848
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:37,803
Tomorrow...

849
00:34:37,804 --> 00:34:40,872
I will be better.

850
00:34:49,082 --> 00:34:52,652
(Indistinct talking)

851
00:34:52,653 --> 00:34:53,786
Hey, Cross. Let's go.

852
00:34:53,787 --> 00:34:55,221
You're prepping O.R. five
for Grey's lab chole.

853
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:57,289
- I'm sorry. What?
- Dr. Wilson has me today.

854
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,358
It's for the chief.

855
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,760
Now, Cross. Come.

856
00:35:00,761 --> 00:35:01,794
No, stay.

857
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:04,530
You've cut lines,
y-y-you've stolen nurses,

858
00:35:04,531 --> 00:35:05,865
you've even rearranged
the O.R. board.

859
00:35:05,866 --> 00:35:08,434
You are not stealing him.
He is mine... mine.

860
00:35:08,435 --> 00:35:10,002
Back off.

861
00:35:10,003 --> 00:35:11,871
Uh, if the chief needs him for Grey,
you got to let him go.

862
00:35:11,872 --> 00:35:13,105
Thank you, Dr. Karev.

863
00:35:13,106 --> 00:35:15,807
- Cross. Come.
- (Scoffs)

864
00:35:16,977 --> 00:35:18,344
- I'll come back.
- (Sighs)

865
00:35:18,345 --> 00:35:21,313
JO: Alex, she's lying.
She's been pulling this crap all day,

866
00:35:21,314 --> 00:35:22,481
saying it's "for the chief."

867
00:35:22,482 --> 00:35:23,849
- She's so full of it.
- Stop.

868
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:24,884
- Stop what?
- Stop whining.

869
00:35:24,885 --> 00:35:26,252
- Ohh.
- Look, she worked you.

870
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:28,154
She got what she wanted
by beating the system.

871
00:35:28,155 --> 00:35:29,188
It's a genius move.

872
00:35:29,189 --> 00:35:31,157
If I had come up with it,
I would've.

873
00:35:31,158 --> 00:35:32,625
Look, you're just mad that you didn't.

874
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:34,427
Deal with it or come up
with something better.

875
00:35:36,006 --> 00:35:37,029
(Scoffs)

876
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,630
(Footsteps depart)

877
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:43,035
(Door opens)

878
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:45,304
What are you doing?

879
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:46,906
I checked with Griggs.
You're clear.

880
00:35:46,907 --> 00:35:49,975
I mean, he was leaving,
so he asked me to let you out.

881
00:35:49,976 --> 00:35:50,943
So I'm not sick.

882
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:52,878
Most likely contact dermatitis.

883
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:54,580
Told him that 12 hours ago.

884
00:35:54,581 --> 00:35:57,450
Um, and, uh, look...
I'm... I'm sorry if,

885
00:35:57,451 --> 00:35:59,185
you know, I hurt you.

886
00:35:59,186 --> 00:36:00,820
We have to be honest with each other.

887
00:36:00,821 --> 00:36:02,855
You were just being honest.
I appreciate that.

888
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:03,823
Thank you.

889
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:06,358
- I mean, you're wrong.
- April.

890
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:08,294
But we are something
worth fighting for,

891
00:36:08,295 --> 00:36:09,862
and I want to fight.

892
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:12,164
So I'll fight for the both of us.

893
00:36:12,165 --> 00:36:14,233
I will launch a full-scale assault.

894
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:19,605
I will ambush and slash and burn
and fight until I am bloody for us.

895
00:36:19,606 --> 00:36:24,176
I will fight to the
death because I vowed to.

896
00:36:24,177 --> 00:36:26,245
And nothing that's happened
since then has changed that.

897
00:36:26,246 --> 00:36:30,082
You see? This is it.
You just want what you want.

898
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,617
You don't care what I think.

899
00:36:31,618 --> 00:36:34,587
I love you too much to let
my mistake end our marriage.

900
00:36:34,588 --> 00:36:38,023
I won't break my promise to you,
so I'm gonna fight.

901
00:36:38,024 --> 00:36:39,357
And I'm gonna win.

902
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:43,362
(Sighs, clears throat)

903
00:36:43,363 --> 00:36:45,598
CALLIE:
Oh, Arizona!

904
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,866
- Hey.
- Ah.

905
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:49,235
(Chuckles)
Here. Sofia forgot this.

906
00:36:49,236 --> 00:36:51,570
We're on, uh...
we made it to page 12.

907
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:52,738
She is exhausted,

908
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:54,406
so you can probably get
away with an early bedtime.

909
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:55,374
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

910
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:56,375
Hey, um, big date?

911
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:57,977
Oh. You heard?

912
00:36:57,978 --> 00:36:59,545
Yeah, I mean, everyone heard.

913
00:36:59,546 --> 00:37:00,513
(Chuckles)

914
00:37:00,514 --> 00:37:04,616
You know, you can tell me, Callie.
You can always tell me.

915
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,454
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

916
00:37:08,455 --> 00:37:09,588
You'd like her.

917
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:11,323
She's funny and sharp

918
00:37:11,324 --> 00:37:13,392
and, um, we don't just find
the same things funny...

919
00:37:13,393 --> 00:37:14,927
we say the same thing
at the same time.

920
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:16,195
It's really almost like...

921
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:17,997
Okay, no, yeah,
you can dial back the enthusiasm.

922
00:37:17,998 --> 00:37:19,064
No, really.

923
00:37:19,065 --> 00:37:21,567
It's like... it's like
we share the same brain.

924
00:37:21,568 --> 00:37:23,402
I mean, read the room.
That's all.

925
00:37:23,403 --> 00:37:26,238
Well, all I'm saying is...
you'd like her.

926
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,907

927

929
00:37:43,857 --> 00:37:45,157
Why won't you talk to me?

930
00:37:45,158 --> 00:37:46,292
I...
(Scoffs)

931
00:37:46,293 --> 00:37:49,261
You won't even look at me,
so help me out, okay?

932
00:37:49,262 --> 00:37:52,598
I mean, are you... are you upset,
angry, confused, or...

933
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:54,233
That one. I'm confused.

If I...

If I had to pick one.

936
00:37:56,636 --> 00:37:58,838
Well, then let's talk
about it so we can...

937
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:01,207
I can't talk about it because
then we start all the kissing,

938
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:03,209
and I don't know why. I don't...
I don't know what it means.

939

(Chuckles)
What does it mean?

940

What do <i>you</i> think it means?

941
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:09,682
I don't know.

00:38:09,683 --> 00:38:13,252
Well, then...

Uh, no. My son's name Chris,
Chris Daniels.

163
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,844
He's in surgery today
to get a new kidney.

164
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,513
Nurse: Let me see if I can
find what room he's in.

165
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,580
- Thank you.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Wilson.

166
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,815
I'm one of Chris' doctors.

167
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,883
Oh, hi.

168
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,685
I hit so much traffic
on the way over here, and I...

169
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,521
[Sighs] So, he's not in surgery yet?

170
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,690
Well, if he is then <i>I'm</i> late,
because I'm his surgeon.

171
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,025
Good. [Chuckles] Okay.

172
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,460
So, I haven't missed it?

173
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,362
No, you haven't missed it.
I can take you to him.

174
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,569
- Yes, please. Thank you.
- Yeah.

175
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,668
BP looks good. You're ready to go.

176
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,303
Well, we need to
start prepping you, too.

177
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,640
I know, but can't it wait
just another minute?

178
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,808
I am not ready to leave him.

179
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,343
- He is my...
- D-Don't say it, Mom!

180
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,045
My baby!

181
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,893
Chris, Cynthia,
you about ready for surgery?

182
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,884
You can start his prep in the O.R.

183
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,319
Thank you, Edwards.

184
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,187
Hey, guys. Good news.

185
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,222
Guess who I found looking for you?

186
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,580
Dad?

187
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,029
What the hell?

188
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,631
Cynthia, look, I just
wanted to check on Chris.

189
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,533
How did you know where we were?

190
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,669
He posted it online.

191
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,304
Today's kidney day.

192
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,372
I had no idea he was even
getting a new kidney.

193
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,675
You need to leave, Ken... right now.

194
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,510
Cynthia, I swear to God...

195
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,411
All right, now that's enough.

196
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,546
- That's enough.
- I-I'm so sorry, sir,

197
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,481
- why don't you...
- Hey!

198
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,449
Chris is my son, too.

199
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,484
Now, I let you do
a lot of stuff without me.

200
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,452
<i>Let</i> me?!

201
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,488
He is my kid, too.
I have a right to be here.

202
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,556
I just want to know he's okay.

203
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,457
Get out!

204
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,659
Chris, buddy, talk to your old man here.

205
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,195
Dad, go.

206
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,364
Get the hell out of here.

207
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,365
Okay, let's go now.

208
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,132
This is my son.

209
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,000
- Get out!
- Look, I understand...

210
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,401
- I have a right to be here.
- Get out!

211
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,603
You hear me? I have rights!

212
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,259
Hey, why don't we sit down?

213
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,707
Why'd you bring him here?

214
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,508
- I'm sor...
- Why would you do that?!

[Clattering]

216
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,746
Cynthia, do you want to sit down?

Hey, big transplant today.
Don't talk to me.

219
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,826
- I'm mad at you.
- Oh, God, did you go?

220
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:42,520
Yes. Now I want to
eat there every night.

221
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:43,855
I told you.
Did you have the steak things?

222
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:45,990
I had two, and then
the dessert tray came.

223
00:07:48,382 --> 00:07:50,261
Uh, I'll come look,
but I think that you're right

224
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:51,529
to delay your patient's ACL surgery

225
00:07:51,564 --> 00:07:52,430
until after she delivers.

226
00:07:52,464 --> 00:07:55,480
Thank you for the consult, Dr. Robbins.

227
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:58,829
I do not know how you do it.

228
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,321
I don't know how you
can be polite to her.

229
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,700
Oh, I know. She's the worst.

230
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,182
Yeah. I couldn't do it,

231
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,217
not after the way
she screwed Webber over.

232
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,653
Yeah, right. Got to go.

233
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:11,056
All Minnick did was
take a job she was offered.

234
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,858
No, she <i>stole</i> that job.

235
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,860
But you're rather
familiar with the concept

236
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,662
of job stealing, aren't you?

237
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,163
Uh, Kepner, are you up to speed

238
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,965
on the big resident transplant?

239
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:20,899
- Yes. Yes.
- Good.

240
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,035
You are running the show.
I have to leave.

241
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,637
- Are you up for that?
- Yes. I... yes.

242
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,972
Uh... uh, where are you going?

243
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,173
I thought you were running the show.

244
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,643
Camp David for a summit meeting.

245
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,079
Wait, actual Camp David?

246
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,247
Well, she's gone.

247
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,375
Maybe you can steal her job, too.

248
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,088
You paged me for a temp pacemaker?

249
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,492
Yeah, she needs a permanent one,
but can't get consent, so...

250
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,561
Well, you need approval? You got it.

251
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:50,629
What is she, intoxicated or something?

252
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,365
Jane Doe, no I.D.
She's confused and disoriented

Ma'am, can you tell me your name?

00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,104
No, no names.

256
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,907
Names are for hats, not for cats.

257
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,876
You put the snake in the hat.

258

- [Murmuring]
- We did ask that.

259
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,248
I'll tell Grendel.
Grendel has all the patterns.

260
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,182
She sees the patterns.

261
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,851
She sees the patterns,
I see the patterns.

262
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,253
- You don't see the diagram...
- Okay.

263
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,355
- ...because I see the diagrams!
- Okay, okay, ma'am.

You don't know the diagrams. You
don't know the diagrams! Okay, okay!

We're gonna give you something
to relax you, all right?

266
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,194
Two I.V. of lorazepam.

267
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,097
- CBC, chem 1 and a tox screen,
and call psych. - Okay.

268
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,994
So, how old is that pacemaker?

269
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,702
That is the Ford Pinto of pacemakers.

270
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,304
Right. Okay, ma'am, we're gonna take

271
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,639
that old pacemaker out and give you

272
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,573
a brand new, shiny one.

273
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,440
How's that sound?

274
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,109
Ahh... For the snakes?

275
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,911
It's for the snakes.

276
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,145
- Yeah.
- For the snakes.

Your BP is through the roof.

We've got to get that down
before surgery.

We're gonna give you a little something

- [Sighs]
- You can't make him leave?

285
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:53,773
I'm so sorry. He never mentioned

286
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:55,546
that you were divorced or...

287
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,793
They're not.

288
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,299
They should be, but they're not.

289
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:04,383
I left with Chris almost a year ago.

290
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:05,813
And you should have done it sooner.

291
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,790
He hit her.

00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:09,023
- Chris!
- What?

293
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:10,831
What? It's why we left.

00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:14,360
I didn't have a job.

Chris was sick all the time,

we left that night,
and now he's showing up

pretending that he is a father?

00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:59,290
I know, but if we could,
she'd say give it to her son.

482
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:00,440
Right?

483
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,960
No doubt. Give it to the kid.

484
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:05,663
Any parent would say the same thing.

485
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:06,764
Sure, any parent with two good kidneys.

486
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:09,033
- She's only got one.
- She might want to hang on to it.

487
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:11,320
Yeah, if she's a monster.

488
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,471
I'd want to hang on to it.

489
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:15,773
And that makes you a monster.

490
00:17:15,807 --> 00:17:17,842
<i>You're</i> the monster.

491
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:22,713
So, we give Chris the kidney,
and then the 16-year-old

492
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:24,648
has to take care of his mom or she dies,

493
00:17:24,683 --> 00:17:27,536
and we've saved his life,
but left him an orphan.

494
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,620
He wouldn't be an orphan.

495
00:17:29,654 --> 00:17:30,654
Yeah, he has a father.

496
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:32,523
A father who used to
beat the crap out of his mom

497
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:33,824
and probably him.

498
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,793
That's who we'd be sending Chris to.

499

- [Elevator chimes]
- You were right.

500
00:17:36,695 --> 00:17:38,496
The company had her records right there.

501
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,964
She was a minor at the time, so...

502
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:40,798
Tell me her name again.

503
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:42,466
The patient's name is Claire Nolan.

504
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:43,667
This is her mother.

505
00:17:43,702 --> 00:17:45,069
Okay. Good work, DeLuca.

506
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:46,637
See? Problem solved.

507
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:48,139
You're very impressed with yourself.

508
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:49,367
Eh, a little bit.

509
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:51,709
Ms. Nolan.

510
00:17:51,743 --> 00:17:53,377
Yes? Gwen.

511
00:17:53,411 --> 00:17:55,646
The police said someone
found my daughter.

512
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,815
Yes. We just have a few questions

513
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:59,280
before we take you to her.

514
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:00,594
Did you call Tim?

515
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:01,962
My ex-husband... Is he coming?

516
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:03,363
He's on his way.

517
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:04,635
Please.

518
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:08,899
Did you daughter have
a history of mental illness?

519
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:12,739
No. That's...

520
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:13,807
Why does that matter?

521
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:15,475
Just prepare yourself...

522
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,212
It'll be a bit of a shock
when you see her.

523
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,080
Well, it's already a shock.

524
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:21,648
It's been 12 years.

525
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,250
I never thought anyone would find her.

526
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:26,286
Well, you may have a hard time
understanding her.

527
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:30,290
Wait, what?

528
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:33,393
Well, her speech is...
very disorganized.

529
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:34,895
She's possibly delusional.

530
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:36,723
She's alive?

531
00:18:37,498 --> 00:18:39,433
Claire's alive?

532
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:43,603
[Voice breaking] Are you
telling my daughter's alive?

533
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:48,442
Did I say he's 16?

534
00:18:48,476 --> 00:18:50,677
I know it doesn't
change anything, but he's 16,

535
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,245
and he is open on a table.

536
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,080
Anything?

537
00:18:53,114 --> 00:18:54,681
Nothing. I'll try Seattle Pres again.

538
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,683
This kid doesn't have another option.

539
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,151
We just lost his donor kidney.

540
00:18:58,186 --> 00:18:59,486
We need another one right now.

541
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,929
What do you mean?

542
00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:03,423
You talking about my son?

543
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,125
Hold on.

544
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:06,326
You're talking about Chris.

545
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,627
You were told to leave.

546
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:08,995
What happened?

547
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,831
What happened to Cynthia? What is it?

548
00:19:10,865 --> 00:19:12,699
I can't discuss
their conditions with you.

549
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,934
Don't you tell me that.

550
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:15,302
That was is son up there,

551
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:17,738
and you have to tell me
what is going on.

552
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,055
Answer me.

553
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:26,480
Kepner, we need an answer.

554
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:27,807
I know!

555
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:30,517
Dr. Webber,
prep the mother for dialysis.

556
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:32,185
I will call UNOS myself.

557
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,954
Karev, start the anastomosis on the boy.

558
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:39,726
Wait! Stop. We might have
another option, but...

559
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,428
But?

560
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:45,192
- Wilson.
- Jo, what is it?

561
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,334
The husband.

562
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:49,236
The son of a bitch
wants to give his kidney,

563
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,705
but we can't do that, right?

564
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:54,922
Right?

565
00:19:58,713 --> 00:19:59,579
[Scoffs]

566
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:04,119
So, people are really embracing
this new method of teaching.

567
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:05,718
Some say it's actually fun.

568
00:20:05,965 --> 00:20:07,893
Today you would have been performing

569
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:10,370
a mother-to-son kidney transplant.

570
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,678
You don't have to sell me
on the method, Bailey.

571
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,179
People like it. I get it.

572
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,747
Good. Then we can stop

573
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:18,717
all of this stubbornness
and the insubordination.

574
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,819
It's not insubordination.

575
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:22,554
Well, it's not cooperation.

576
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:25,424
Look, I made you my Chief of General

577
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,493
because I wanted you
to be my right hand.

578
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:28,527
So, you want a Yes Man?

579
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,728
[Sighs] No.

580
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:34,304
I want someone who will lead
with me but follow when I lead.

581
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,336
Even if I think
you're leading the wrong way?

582
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,838
I shouldn't speak up when
I think you're making a misstep?

583
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,582
You don't want that in a right hand?

584
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:42,709
I'm not making a misstep.

585
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,244
I disagree,

586
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:45,946
but you don't want to hear
a dissenting opinion.

587
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,814
Well, you never offered me your opinion.

588
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:49,082
You just shut Minnick out.

589
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:51,084
I didn't have time
to offer you an opinion.

590
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,953
You just showed Richard the door.

591
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:54,421
How could you do that?

592
00:20:54,455 --> 00:20:55,655
I didn't want to do that.

593
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,124
I... [Exhales sharply]

594
00:20:57,158 --> 00:20:59,793
I wanted him to stay right where he was.

595
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:01,995
I wanted Minnick to add value,

596
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:04,231
but she wouldn't work with him.

597
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:07,267
So, you sided with Minnick
and tossed Richard aside?

598
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:08,335
No.

599
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:10,604
Look, I had a choice to make, Grey,

600
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:12,572
and I didn't want
to make it, because, yes,

601
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:15,442
Dr. Webber built this place.

602
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:16,943
But I have to keep building it.

603
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:19,980
So I do that by
asking myself 100 times a day

604
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:22,182
"What would Richard Webber do?"

605
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:26,420
But how did Eliza Minnick
win you over so quickly?

606
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:32,292
When I saw this program,
this better way of teaching,

607
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:35,128
I asked myself again,
"What would Richard Webber do?"

608
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,332
And he would have embraced
this, Grey, you know it.

609
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,468
The answer was so clear.

610
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:43,503
I couldn't ignore that choice.

611
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:45,372
But you made the wrong choice.

612
00:21:45,406 --> 00:21:48,542
Look, you can serve under
Chief Webber if you want to,

613
00:21:48,576 --> 00:21:51,978
but that doesn't change the fact
that he is not your chief.

00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:52,746
<i>I</i> am.

00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,382

Not until he does.

Okay, there's a difference

623
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:14,367
between loyalty and stubbornness, Grey.

624
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:16,403
I do not want to be reinstated

625

unless Richard Webber is
as Residency Director.

626

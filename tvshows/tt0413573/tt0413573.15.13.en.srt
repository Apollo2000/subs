1
00:00:03,473 --> 00:00:05,606
There's an invisible line in the O.R.

2
00:00:05,642 --> 00:00:08,409
You scrub, you gown, you glove,

3
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:09,689
and you approach the sterile field.

4
00:00:09,713 --> 00:00:11,112
Ah. I'll get that.

5
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:14,068
And a large Americano for me, please.

6
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:15,850
- I can pay for my own coffee.
- I know.

7
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:17,511
But since you won't let me
take you on an actual date...

8
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:19,311
Yet. I just have to speak
to Maggie first.

9
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:20,880
I told you... she doesn't care.

10
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:22,214
Come out with me tonight.

11
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:24,169
I know this great spot
with a view of Lake Union.

12
00:00:25,487 --> 00:00:26,919
Thanks for the coffee.

13
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:28,921
It's an important boundary.

14
00:00:28,957 --> 00:00:32,758
It's there to protect
the patient and you.

15
00:00:32,794 --> 00:00:35,827
I realize that I can't
live out of a hotel forever,

16
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:38,463
but I would really miss
the bacon on the buffet.

17
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:39,824
Oh! Otherworldly crispiness.

18
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:42,166
- I don't know how they do it.
- Mmm, the Danishes.

19
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:44,402
Maybe it's the hormones,
but just mentioning

20
00:00:44,437 --> 00:00:46,613
- the word "Danish" just gets me...
- What?

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,940
- Hungry.
- Well, we should try room service some time.

22
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:50,656
- Oh, room service?
- My... My... My treat.

23
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:52,276
Without that line...

24
00:00:52,312 --> 00:00:53,355
- Hey.
- Hey.

25
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,614
... about a million things can go wrong.

26
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,082
Uh, uh, Tom and I just realized
that we're, uh...

27
00:00:58,118 --> 00:00:59,195
- we're staying at the same hotel.
- Yeah.

28
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,652
Oh, wow, that's...

29
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:02,487
- Convenient.
- Yeah.

30
00:01:02,523 --> 00:01:03,955
Right.

31
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:05,323
I have to go follow up on a...

32
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:06,933
a patient, um, from last night.

33
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:08,070
So, you're gonna cover the pit?

34
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:09,794
Yeah, yeah, I'll be there
after I drop Leo.

35
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,195
- Great.
- Okay.

36
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:13,375
- Funny that something so important...
- Uh.

37
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:14,633
... is completely invisible.

38
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:20,004
How is it we spend every day saving lives

39
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,306
and we can't keep
a stupid houseplant alive?

40
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:23,874
Mnh-mnh. We just need a plant

41
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,709
that doesn't need sunlight or water.

42
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:28,646
When did that happen?

43
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:30,981
Oh, come on. I hate that thing.

44
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:32,116
I smile weird.

45
00:01:32,152 --> 00:01:33,451
No, you don't.

46
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:35,886
You smile handsome and confident

47
00:01:35,922 --> 00:01:37,522
and accomplished.

48
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:39,490
And, Alex, think about where you started,

49
00:01:39,526 --> 00:01:40,991
how far you've come.

50
00:01:41,027 --> 00:01:43,327
W-When you were bouncing
around foster homes,

51
00:01:43,363 --> 00:01:44,840
trying to keep your brother
and sister alive,

52
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:46,342
did you ever think that you would grow up

53
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:48,533
to be Chief of Surgery?

54
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:49,778
This is something to celebrate.

55
00:01:49,802 --> 00:01:51,747
Here, get beside it. I'm gonna
take a picture for your mom.

56
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:54,004
- Come on, Jo.
- Get beside the picture.

57
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:57,875
Okay, ready?

58
00:02:01,714 --> 00:02:03,714
Perfect.

59
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:04,915
I'm gonna frame it.

60
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:07,417
This is so much better than a houseplant.

61
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:09,720
- Hey, Chief!
- Thanks for the breakfast again!

62
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,354
Oh, yeah, no problem.

63
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:13,523
He's the best.

64
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:16,594
Um, hey, there was a breakfast?

65
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:18,506
Yeah, yeah, it was just
something with the interns.

66
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,530
I do it once a week.

67
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:21,164
Uh, coffee, bagels.

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,467
It's, uh... it helps
with morale and stuff.

69
00:02:24,971 --> 00:02:27,237
How much longer is the sabbatical?

70
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,039
Two months.

71
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:30,373
And stuff.

72
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:34,344
Hey. Say "hi" to Harriet.

73
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,545
You remember Leo.

74
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:37,447
We left Flopsy at Mom's yesterday,

75
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:40,283
- so it was a super fun morning.
- Flopsy?

76
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,018
- Yeah, that's her stuffed bunny.
- Ah.

77
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:43,564
There's gonna come a time
when Leo becomes

78
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:45,722
so attached to something,
he can't sleep without it.

79
00:02:45,757 --> 00:02:47,289
Buy two of those things.

80
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:49,358
Maybe 10.

81
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:51,027
- Hey.
- Okay. Hey.

82
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:52,762
Rehab called. Betty ran away.

83
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,396
What? Okay, what do we do?

84
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:56,032
I-I got Tom to cover my service.

85
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:57,812
I can go to the house.
I'll call her friends.

86
00:02:57,836 --> 00:02:59,379
I've got a trauma. Um, I'll get Teddy...

87
00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:00,637
No, no, no, take the trauma.

88
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:02,639
Well, if we both leave work every time...

89
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:03,973
Just give me Leo.

90
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:06,475
I will check him into daycare.

91
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:07,777
I think this thing with Betty

92
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,456
is more a marathon
than a sprint, you know?

93
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,647
Okay. You sure?

94
00:03:10,682 --> 00:03:11,814
- I'm sure. Go.
- Okay.

95
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,282
Tami Bercini to Physical Therapy.

96
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:14,817
Tami Bercini to Physical Therapy.

97
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,654
Hey.

98
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:19,221
Can I speak to you?

99
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:20,295
Mm-hmm.

100
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,126
So, I was thinking about going on a date.

101
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,660
With...

102
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:26,427
Andrew DeLuca.

103
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:27,595
Cece liked him.

104
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:29,631
And if you're mad, then I don't...

105
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,667
Why would I be mad?

106
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,634
I am so mad at you.

107
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,903
- Why?
- You stood up Link.

108
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:36,638
Well, I apologized, and he accepted.

109
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,074
Yeah, 'cause he's a great guy!

110
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,509
I can't take everybody
being mad at me.

111
00:03:41,545 --> 00:03:43,578
I... What?

112
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:45,370
I'm on your service.

113
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:47,849
So we'll talk?

114
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:49,317
Yeah. Uh-huh.

115
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:50,418
Okay.

116
00:03:51,454 --> 00:03:54,589
- A-about what?
- First up, Kimberly Thompson.

117
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:56,024
Oh, my God, I saw that name.

118
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,325
It gave me chills.

119
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,672
I went to med school
with a Kimberly Thompson

120
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,996
I could not stand, but she
made everyone call her...

121
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,463
Kiki!

122
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:04,532
It's really you.

123
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:06,767
I cannot believe it is really you.

124
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:07,968
Me neither.

125
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:11,438
You look exactly how I remember you.

126
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:13,373
Minus the braces, of course.

127
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:15,710
Your teeth turned out so cute.

128
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:18,012
I... Uh, thank you. And... And, uh, you?

129
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,095
You... Are you...

130
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,182
I have a little practice in North Dakota.

131
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:23,150
Family medicine.

132
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:24,651
Not like Magpie.

133
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:27,822
Head of cardio, hello!

134
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:29,523
Hello!

135
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:32,026
Yeah. Uh, do you want to, uh, present?

136
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:34,661
Uh, Kimberly Thompson, 43,

137
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:37,664
with a history of a bicuspid aortic valve

138
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,334
and a thoracic aortic aneurysm
requiring repair

139
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:42,737
with the elephant trunk
technique 10 years ago.

140
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:45,505
She presents with weakening
and dilation of the graft.

141
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,742
I guess I don't have to explain
how serious this is.

142
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:51,477
Nope. Old graft in my aorta's giving out.

143
00:04:51,512 --> 00:04:54,547
I've seen eight surgeons,
including Abby Miller.

144
00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:57,851
You remember Abby from school
with the weird dresses?

145
00:04:57,886 --> 00:04:59,552
No one will touch it.

146
00:04:59,587 --> 00:05:02,688
And then I saw that
you are running cardiothoracic

147
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:03,990
at Grey-Sloan.

148
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:05,759
So, what do you say, Magpie...

149
00:05:05,794 --> 00:05:07,193
you wanna save my life?

150
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:12,698
Okay. Dispatch mentioned
there was a shooting downtown?

151
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:13,734
Gunfire at a parade.

152
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:14,901
People just started running.

153
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:16,402
Not quite sure what we're getting.

154
00:05:16,437 --> 00:05:17,670
The first sunny day in weeks,

155
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:19,739
and families are dodging bullets.

156
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:23,788
- What do we got?
- We were right in the middle

157
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:25,178
of performing on 24th,

158
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:27,113
and... and my son... he was shot.

159
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:29,682
- He was bleeding everywhere.
- Colin Anderson, 15.

160
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:31,461
Bullet went through his hand
and into his chest.

161
00:05:31,485 --> 00:05:33,685
Sats 87 on 4 liters of oxygen.

162
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,053
What's happening? Dad?

163
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,588
Yeah, you're all right, sonny.

164
00:05:36,623 --> 00:05:38,290
Okay, clear Trauma 1. Let's go.

165
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:40,425
Why would someone bring a gun

166
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,060
to a bloody parade?!

167
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:49,096

168
00:05:50,843 --> 00:05:51,870
Doctor, excuse me.

169
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:53,872
I'm looking for Colin from the parade.

170
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:55,503
- I just came in here.
- What?

171
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:56,787
Me mate's lad that was shot, mate...

172
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:57,945
they just brought him in here.

173
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:00,112
Sir, just...
W-We're gonna update you, okay?

174
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:01,479
All right? Uh, catch me up.

175
00:06:01,515 --> 00:06:03,381
Police arrested a shooter...

176
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:05,150
some drunk got worked up
during the music.

177
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:06,296
Said he meant to shoot straight up.

178
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,452
The pistol "slipped."

179
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:08,843
Oh, it slipped and hit a
kid and started a panic.

180
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:10,856
- Yeah.
- I am so sick of this crap.

181
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:13,091
Everything else is people
who got hurt trying to escape.

182
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:15,660
Uh, where do you need me?

183
00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:17,762
GSW to the right chest and left hand.

184
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:19,997
I put in a chest tube,
but he lost his airway

185
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,110
before we could hook it up.

186
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:22,334
So, how is he doing?

187
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:23,437
- What's your name, sir?
- Seamus.

188
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:25,403
We're gonna figure that out,
Seamus, okay?

189
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,840
Oh, God. W-What is happening?

190
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,975
200 cc in the pleurovac.

191
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,082
We're gonna have to do a scan,

192
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:34,078
get a better idea of your son's injuries.

193
00:06:34,113 --> 00:06:36,848
Sorry, but it's best if you step outside.

194
00:06:36,883 --> 00:06:38,616
That's my boy. I'm not leaving.

195
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:39,929
- Seamus...
- I'll... I'll step aside,

196
00:06:39,953 --> 00:06:42,086
but I'm not leaving my boy.

197
00:06:42,121 --> 00:06:43,822
Okay.

198
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:46,057
Let's get a portable X-ray,
and somebody page Avery!

199
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,160
Lucy Reid, 71, admitted last night

200
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:53,431
for a syncopal work-up and a
head lac after a fall at home.

201
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:56,334
Well, your EKG and enzymes
all look normal.

202
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:58,135
Which means I get to go home.

203
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,871
Beautiful.

204
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:02,318
You just need to make sure that
she follows up with the clinic,

205
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:04,275
but other than that,
everything looks good.

206
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,777
And you'll need to keep
an eye on her when she's home.

207
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:09,847
Or, uh... or... or you'll
keep an eye on her at home.

208
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:11,615
- I'm... I'm not sure.
- Please.

209
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,885
These two... all they do is hover.

210
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,952
They got it covered.

211
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:17,788
Now, if one of you will
just hand me my slippers

212
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:19,857
so I can blow this popstand.

213
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:21,692
What about her dizzy spells?

214
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:22,960
The ringing in her ears?

215
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:24,828
Did she get a carotid duplex?

216
00:07:24,864 --> 00:07:27,831
Uh, she never mentioned anything
about dizziness or tinnitus.

217
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:28,900
Not to me, either.

218
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:30,880
Well, you were dizzy
at the Wakemans' anniversary.

219
00:07:30,904 --> 00:07:34,854
Because you were heavy-handed
with the Gin Rickey.

220
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:37,474
And when you came to my place Friday,

221
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,476
you stood at the door and asked,

222
00:07:39,512 --> 00:07:40,811
"Is a tea kettle whistling?"

223
00:07:40,846 --> 00:07:42,056
So this has happened a few times?

224
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,747
- This is all news to me.
- Please.

225
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:45,749
I'm getting old, okay?

226
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:47,818
This is all nonsense.

227
00:07:47,853 --> 00:07:49,820
"Nonsense" is what you say when I'm right

228
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:51,822
- and you want me to shut up.
- Same here.

229
00:07:51,857 --> 00:07:56,092
Well, it only happens when
I turn my head too quickly.

230
00:07:56,128 --> 00:07:57,728
Helm, forget about the duplex.

231
00:07:57,763 --> 00:08:00,997
Get a CT angio of head and neck
and page neuro.

232
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,399
- Neuro? Why?
- W-What is it?

233
00:08:02,435 --> 00:08:03,714
W-What do you hear?

234
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,768
She has a bruit.

235
00:08:04,804 --> 00:08:07,504
Uh, it's the sound that the blood makes

236
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,750
when the artery is constricted.

237
00:08:08,774 --> 00:08:10,707
So I need to do some tests to make sure

238
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:12,220
that her blood vessels
don't have any disease.

239
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:13,744
So, the two of you can stay here

240
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:15,913
and wait for your, um...

241
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:17,414
for your Lucille.

242
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,815
All right, let's go.

243
00:08:19,484 --> 00:08:20,683
Seniors rocking the poly.

244
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:21,851
I like it.

245
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:25,120
Yes, just let me know
if you hear from her, please.

246
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:26,956
That's her there.

247
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:28,858
Dr. Shepherd? Dr. Amelia Shepherd?

248
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:30,604
Yes. Uh, I-I can't talk
right now. If you have...

249
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:31,939
We need to talk to you about Britney.

250
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:33,796
I think you know her as Betty.

251
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,934
Are you...

252
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:39,869
- You're her...
- We're her parents.

253
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:46,553
- So, she did call you?
- Yeah.

254
00:08:46,588 --> 00:08:48,889
- When?
- Uh, two days ago.

255
00:08:48,914 --> 00:08:51,442
We started driving to
the rehab center right away.

256
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:53,873
We were just so happy she was alive.

257
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,876
And they gave us your number,
and they said that...

258
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,911
that you were her legal guardian?

259
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:02,414
Uh, she's been living with us
for a few months now.

260
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,783
I tried to call you several times.

261
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:06,851
I-I thought I was calling you,

262
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:09,121
but she gave me a fake number.

263
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:11,457
I-I'm sorry, I'm just
trying to figure out

264
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:14,455
how she even met you in the first place

265
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,546
and how you started looking after her.

266
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:18,541
We thought that maybe
she had come to the hospital

267
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:20,599
looking for more drugs.

268
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,333
She came in, uh,

269
00:09:22,368 --> 00:09:24,469
for a doctor's appointment for Leo.

270
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:27,404
And, um, she was trying
to stay off drugs for him.

271
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,174
I could see that she needed help,

272
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:31,843
and, uh...

273
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:35,580
And so she just became
a part of our family.

274
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:36,615
Who's Leo?

275
00:09:36,648 --> 00:09:38,715
Is that... Is that her boyfriend?

276
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,685
Is that why she never came home?

277
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,134
Yeah, it looks like the hand's perfused,

278
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:47,958
but we've got metacarpal fractures here.

279
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:49,338
I'm gonna have to take a look in the O.R.

280
00:09:49,362 --> 00:09:50,494
Blood pressure's holding

281
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:51,962
and the bullet's near the hilum...

282
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:53,033
Let's get him ready to move.

283
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:55,444
Bleeding might be from a damaged
branch of the pulmonary artery.

284
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:56,512
He was just playing in the band.

285
00:09:56,536 --> 00:09:57,832
I-I don't understand why this happened.

286
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:00,504
Seamus, we have to take Colin to CT now.

287
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:01,984
- I'm going with him.
- No, sir, we're...

288
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:03,618
we're gonna take really good care of him.

289
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:05,142
Karev, it's fine. Let him go.

290
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,678
All right, son.

291
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:10,714
How's it out here?

292
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:12,348
Oh, usual bumps and bruises.

293
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:14,117
You three have the worst of it.

294
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:16,419
I can help out down
here until Colin's out of CT.

295
00:10:16,454 --> 00:10:18,354
Uh, we've got a complex forehead lac

296
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,390
in bed 2... it...

297
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:23,126
What in God's name is that sound?

298
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:46,415
So, um, what's the deal...

299
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,316
Is this really bad or really good?!

300
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:50,252
Well, I think it's
a beautiful instrument!

301
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:04,066
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, guys!

302
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:05,567
Stop! Stop!

303
00:11:05,602 --> 00:11:07,702
- Stop, please.
- Sorry, mate.

304
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:10,271
We're just trying to find a way
to lift Colin's spirits.

305
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:11,306
His what?

306
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:14,108
His spirits. Spirits. Colin's spirits.

307
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:16,043
Yeah, whatever. Look, we got ambulances

308
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,278
coming in and out of here.

309
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:18,517
If you guys want to help,

310
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,914
just go inside and give some blood, okay?

311
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:26,920
Hey, hey, did you find her?

312
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:28,956
No. But her parents are here.

313
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:30,724
- What?
- Yeah, Betty's parents.

314
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,925
Britney's parents.

315
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:32,961
She called them from rehab,

316
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:34,606
but before they could get there,
she ran away,

317
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,098
and rehab gave them my name.

318
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:39,144
Wow. Are they... what are they...

319
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:40,734
She didn't tell them.

320
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,049
They still don't know about Leo.

321
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,375
Jo. Come with me. I need you.

322
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:50,743
For what?

323
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:53,045
Well, you are studying
cutting-edge medicine,

324
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:55,226
and I am in need all of the
cutting edges that I can get.

325
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,250
I need your brain on a case.

326
00:11:57,285 --> 00:11:58,951
Um, we're pretty busy today.

327
00:11:58,987 --> 00:12:01,154
Well, Jo found the scope
that saved Catherine's life.

328
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:02,967
And... And you're reading
all the latest everything,

329
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:04,491
and that is what I need today.

330
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:05,825
And I cleared it with the chief.

331
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,060
Uh, I sign her paychecks, and I say no.

332
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:11,964
Bailey. I'm asking for help.

333
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,134
Do you have any idea
how rare that is for me?

334
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:18,438
Fine.

335
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:21,007
But next time, clear it with this chief.

336
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:22,108
Okay.

337
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:27,647
Lucille, there's an area of narrowing

338
00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:30,315
in one of your arteries
called a stenosis,

339
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:33,619
as well as an aneurysm
in that same artery

340
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:35,187
deeper in your brain.

341
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,623
Dr. Koracick is a neurosurgeon,

342
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:39,992
and he will repair the aneurysm,

343
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:41,994
and I will fix the stenosis.

344
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,540
I knew I should have made you
go to the doctor

345
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:44,875
the first time you were dizzy.

346
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:47,299
And I should make you eat less red meat,

347
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:48,668
but how lucky am I with that?

348
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:50,602
No time for jokes, Luce.

349
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:52,437
Jules.

350
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:55,041
Look at these doctors. They're tops.

351
00:12:55,076 --> 00:12:57,876
We have nothing to worry about, right?

352
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,311
Absolutely. Jules, your wife
is in excellent hands.

353
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,784
Usually I earn the laughter,
but this seems a little, um...

354
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,719
What's the word I'm looking for?

355
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:10,221
It's called being wrong, dear.

356
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,157
But we get it all the time.

357
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,059
Marvin is my husband,

358
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,327
but Jules, oh, he's my best friend.

359
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,963
We've... wow... for 30 years now, huh?

360
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,464
I think you skipped a decade.

361
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,633
Oh, yes, the decade you were married

362
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,635
to that dreadful woman.

363
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,804
Shirl.

364
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,338
As if that were a name.

365
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,707
You know, Shirl never believed

366
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,241
that Luce and I were just friends.

367
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,910
And she's not here, but I am,

368
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,713
so what does that tell you?

369
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,480
Oh, it tells me you have
better taste in men

370
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,516
than I do in women.

371
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,417
Damn right I do.

372
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,152
- Excuse me.
- Mmm, my little, mmm, pookie.

373
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,589
Well, um, Dr. Helm will be here
to prep you for the O.R.,

374
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,224
and we will see you in surgery.

375
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,892
Right.

376
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,094
Yeah.

377
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,528
Ah.

378
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,897
- My money's on thrupple.
- Thrupple?

379
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,899
Oh, God, there's so much
I have to teach you.

380
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,845
Hey. Um, can you talk?

381
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,579
And, Magpie, do you remember

382
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:14,183
when Dr. Hartwell made us
suture on ham hocks?

383
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,252
What was wrong with him?

384
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,054
Did she just call you "Magpie"?

385
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:19,174
Who is that?

386
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,390
Kiki Thompson. I went to
med school with her.

387
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,270
- Apparently she hates her.
- What was her name? Sally?

388
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:25,394
- Why?
- Oh, my God.

389
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:29,065
Do you remember when you stole
that cadaver heart?

390
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,567
You were so weird.

391
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:34,303
Yeah, I was.

392
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:36,305
She used to belittle me every single day

393
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,417
in front of the whole class.

394
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:39,408
She bought diapers and put
them on my work station

395
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:42,145
'cause I was the
"widdle baby of the class,"

396
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,780
and everybody laughed, and I laughed.

397
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,714
I had to pretend she was funny,
but she wasn't.

398
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,160
She wasn't funny.
She was mean and vicious.

399
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:48,750
How much longer, Magpie?

400
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:50,252
You're doing great, Kiki.

401
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:51,719
Uh, we just need a few more scans..

402
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:53,454
... of your guts, which I hate.

403
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,290
I hate your guts.

404
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:57,292
- Did you need something?
- No.

405
00:14:58,461 --> 00:14:59,961
Scans are up.

406
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:06,768
Oh. Oh. It's worse than you thought.

407
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:09,337
Can she even survive a replacement?

408
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:14,943
I used to lie in bed at night,
wishing she was dead.

409
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:16,144
That's dark.

410
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:24,678
Hena Cuevas to the O.R.
Hena Cuevas to the O.R.

411
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:26,582
- Hey.
- Hey.

412
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:28,869
Another kid got shot.

413
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:30,248
Probably won't even make the news.

414
00:15:30,272 --> 00:15:31,772
Hmm, that's great.

415
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:32,915
What?

416
00:15:34,442 --> 00:15:35,575
Sorry. What?

417
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,777
- You okay?
- Um...

418
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,131
I have an aortic graft replacement.

419
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:42,614
Mm-hmm.

420
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:46,618
I have a very dangerous
aortic graft replacement

421
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,387
on a woman I hated in med school

422
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:49,496
and I still hate,

423
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,391
and I'm... I-I'm shaking
with rage about the fact

424
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:53,671
that she would even come in here

425
00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:55,295
and set me up to be the one to kill her.

426
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,596
Well, first of all,

427
00:15:57,631 --> 00:16:00,599
that is excellent sharing, Maggie Pierce.

428
00:16:00,634 --> 00:16:02,501
- Right?
- Very nice.

429
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:04,236
- Please try not to kill her.
- Mnh.

430
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,939
And if you do, just try to make sure

431
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:08,504
it is not on purpose.

432
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:09,742
Mm-hmm.

433
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:13,611
Mnh.

434
00:16:13,646 --> 00:16:16,748
She was pregnant when she left?

435
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:19,517
Eileen and Rachel
haven't heard from her, either.

436
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:21,485
So, wait. D-Did the... Did the drugs...

437
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:23,254
Did... Did they affect the baby?

438
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,689
No, no. No, he's perfectly healthy.

439
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,159
That's him.

440
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,862
In the red sweatshirt... that's Leo.

441
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:35,033
Can I hold him?

442
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,538
Okay, Qadri, so,

443
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:42,941
we're gonna get Mr. Dyson's labs
back right away,

444
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:44,808
and tell me what complications

445
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:46,677
we are going to look out for.

446
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:48,846
We'll want to monitor
his crit for any bleeding,

447
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,514
his drain output for a leak,

448
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,651
and monitor his vitals for...

449
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:02,326
Right, Dr. Grey?

450
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:05,863
I'm sorry. Say that...

451
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:08,466
Everything you just said, say again.

452
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:09,734
Okay.

453
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,179
We'll monitor his crit for any bleeding,

454
00:17:11,203 --> 00:17:14,171
his drain output for a leak, and...

455
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:17,742
watch his vitals... for... um...

456
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:24,514
No looking at me like that at work.

457
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:25,549
It's a rule.

458
00:17:25,584 --> 00:17:26,650
Until you talk to Maggie.

459
00:17:26,685 --> 00:17:27,732
Ever.

460
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:29,719
We're professionals,
and it's distracting.

461
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:33,590
- I spoke to Maggie.
- What did she say?

462
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,258
Nothing, but she was acting weird.

463
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:36,859
I think maybe you're acting weird.

464
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:38,662
Well, I hope you're right,

465
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:40,397
but, still, she's my sister,

466
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:42,031
so I need to hear it from her.

467
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:44,434
Okay, well, for the record,
my sister's never once

468
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:45,935
asked me if she can date my exes.

469
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,438
She just dives right in.

470
00:17:48,473 --> 00:17:50,206
Hmm.

471
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:52,096
And how does that make you feel?

472
00:17:52,877 --> 00:17:54,711
Good point.

473
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:56,846
Ah! Stop breaking rules.

474
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,520
He totally has Britney's eyes.

475
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:05,922
Oh, my God!

476
00:18:05,957 --> 00:18:07,556
He's so strong.

477
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:09,758
What a strong baby she was.

478
00:18:09,794 --> 00:18:10,909
Hey, is he talking yet?

479
00:18:10,945 --> 00:18:12,962
Uh, he just started saying, "doe doe,"

480
00:18:12,997 --> 00:18:14,763
but we... we don't know what it means.

481
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,266
I just... I can't believe this is real.

482
00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:18,390
So cute!

483
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:20,369
Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Nelson,

484
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:21,938
I need to be in the O.R.

485
00:18:21,973 --> 00:18:23,502
Last name is Dickinson.

486
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:26,542
So, so she lied about that, too?

487
00:18:26,577 --> 00:18:27,810
Uh, please excuse me.

488
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:32,494
Can't you just hand it off?

489
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,583
I can't be here, Amelia. I just can't.

490
00:18:41,992 --> 00:18:43,892
No, Magpie.

491
00:18:43,927 --> 00:18:45,293
Don't you say it, too.

492
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,964
I have to agree with your other doctors.

493
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:51,900
We've... We've looked into it,

494
00:18:51,935 --> 00:18:54,700
and the procedure is just too dangerous.

495
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:57,370
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

496
00:18:57,975 --> 00:18:59,608
Or you don't want to help me

497
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:01,020
because I'm the bitch from med school

498
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:02,611
that made life a living hell for you.

499
00:19:02,646 --> 00:19:04,079
Did she leave the CT microphone on?

500
00:19:04,114 --> 00:19:05,847
- Mnh. Mnh.
- Mnh.

501
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:08,516
Um, this isn't about you or me.

502
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:10,919
It's about the graft.

503
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:13,088
It's too risky to repair it.

504
00:19:13,123 --> 00:19:15,623
Did she tell you I left diapers
on her work station?

505
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:17,993
Yeah, were they dirty diapers, or... ?

506
00:19:18,028 --> 00:19:20,828
Listen, I can hold a grudge
with the best of them, Maggie,

507
00:19:20,864 --> 00:19:21,963
but come on.

508
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,933
Okay, fine. I don't like you.

509
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:26,935
I really, really dislike you.

510
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,104
When we studied grotesque
diseases in pathology,

511
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:32,207
I imagined that you had them,
because you singled me out

512
00:19:32,242 --> 00:19:33,942
and you tortured me and abused me.

513
00:19:33,977 --> 00:19:36,945
So, no, if anybody
can repair your heart...

514
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,713
which I don't think that they can...

515
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:40,815
I can't imagine why
you would want it to be me.

516
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,349
Should we still be here right now?

517
00:19:42,385 --> 00:19:43,645
Remember Michelle Bukin?

518
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,788
I told her our immunology final
was moved a week.

519
00:19:46,823 --> 00:19:49,390
She slept through it
and failed the class,

520
00:19:49,426 --> 00:19:51,826
because I wanted a better shot
at being number one.

521
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:54,829
So, your defense is that you
were hateful to everyone?

522
00:19:54,864 --> 00:19:57,197
Yes, and I'd like a chance to change that

523
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:58,900
in this lifetime.

524
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:01,736
Because if I die now and there is a hell,

525
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:02,837
that's where I'm going.

526
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:06,541
Do you think I wanted to come here?

527
00:20:07,376 --> 00:20:08,576
I didn't.

528
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:10,044
But you're the best.

529
00:20:10,947 --> 00:20:12,346
So, I'm asking...

530
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:16,240
Could you just take the win

531
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:18,052
and help me?

532
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:20,887
Please?

533
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:26,526
Okay. What do the scans show?

534
00:20:26,562 --> 00:20:28,606
Show that it hit a branch of
the pulmonary artery and veins.

535
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,041
Okay, we're gonna have to open his chest

536
00:20:30,065 --> 00:20:32,065
so we can directly visualize
any other injuries.

537
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,678
All right, I'll stand by
and repair his hand

538
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:34,779
when you're done in the chest.

539
00:20:34,803 --> 00:20:37,838
There was a shooting
of schoolchildren in Scotland.

540
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:39,372
16 schoolchildren.

541
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:41,074
What? When?

542
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,208
20 years ago.

543
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:43,697
A man walked into the gym

544
00:20:43,732 --> 00:20:47,180
and opened fire
on a bunch of innocent kids.

545
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:49,615
We still talk about it.

546
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,750
We still cry about it.
We still pray about it.

547
00:20:51,786 --> 00:20:54,086
And we changed the gun laws
because of it.

548
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:55,588
We said never again,

549
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:57,122
and there's never been another one.

550
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:59,091
My boy could die...

551
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:02,728
... and nothing will change because of it.

552
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,130
No law will change. How...
How can that be possible?

553
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:06,932
Sir, we can't let you go past this point.

554
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:08,767
No, no, no!

555
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:10,135
I want to hold his hand!

556
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,904
You stop here for his safety.

557
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,416
Let us save him. Let us save his life.

558
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,041
He was just walking down the street!

559
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:17,153
He was just playing his music.

560
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:18,310
Seamus, you must look at me.

561
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:19,378
Look at me.

562
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,147
I've got him.

563
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:24,049
I've got your son, okay?

564
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:27,552
Okay?

565
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:28,587
Got to go.

566
00:21:40,544 --> 00:21:42,576
No haggis, neeps, and tatties... typical.

567
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:44,146
Aye.

568
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:48,885
Bailey.

569
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:51,669
What's wrong with this picture?

570
00:21:51,705 --> 00:21:53,389
Karev's smile is unnatural,

571
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:55,298
and... and it seems... forced.

572
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:56,666
No, why is it in this order?

573
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:58,234
With him on the end.

574
00:21:58,269 --> 00:21:59,881
And why does he even have
a picture at all?

575
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:01,604
He's an interim.

576
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,105
Mark Sloan was an interim.

577
00:22:03,141 --> 00:22:04,752
I don't see his picture up here anywhere.

578
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:06,876
Well, Mark Sloan's name
is all over this hospital.

579
00:22:06,912 --> 00:22:09,345
I read an article in Tech Daily

580
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,514
that glowed about

581
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,283
Grey-Sloan Hospital's hyperbaric suite,

582
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:17,019
and do you know who got the nod

583
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:19,021
for spearheading innovation here?

584
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:20,088
Chief Karev.

585
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:22,090
Not interim, not temporary...

586
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,358
just "chief."

587
00:22:23,393 --> 00:22:25,861
The world is anointing Alex Karev

588
00:22:25,896 --> 00:22:28,096
for my blood, sweat, and tears.

589
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:30,732
Stevie Ryder.

590
00:22:31,635 --> 00:22:35,804
Patient I treated repeatedly
for years for diverticulitis.

591
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,407
And I worked tirelessly
to get it under control.

592
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:40,876
Then, one Thanksgiving,

593
00:22:40,911 --> 00:22:43,144
I left to have dinner
with Adele's family,

594
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,747
and Stevie came in with severe bleeding,

595
00:22:45,783 --> 00:22:49,217
and you performed an emergency colectomy.

596
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:51,052
Now, even though I did all of the legwork

597
00:22:51,088 --> 00:22:53,421
to keep him healthy all those years,

598
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:57,925
you get a gift basket of
Christmas pears every year.

599
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,094
Oh, those are your pears.

600
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,780
They're absolutely my pears.

601
00:23:02,365 --> 00:23:05,666
But that's just how
it goes sometimes, Bailey.

602
00:23:05,702 --> 00:23:08,603
It's part of the job.

603
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:10,605
And stop staring at that picture.

604
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:22,250
Mnh.

605
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:24,652
Huh! That's more like it.

606
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:26,420
Mm-hmm.

607
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:33,460
What?

608
00:23:36,486 --> 00:23:38,766
I mean, if Lucille
and Julian are friends,

609
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:40,300
they're friends with benefits.

610
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Oh, friends with retirement benefits.

611
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:45,973
Ha! That was solid. Fluoro.

612
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,775
I-I don't even think
that it's a friendship.

613
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,321
I mean, it's just a whole lot of denial.

614
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,853
What... you can't picture a world

615
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,813
with septuagenarian three-ways?

616
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,192
Right? I mean, you could do
a whole lot worse

617
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:55,601
than having too many people love you.

618
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,185
Remember when interns were afraid

619
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,853
to speak to their attendings?

620
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:02,389
I miss that.

621
00:24:02,424 --> 00:24:03,598
In relationships like this,

622
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:05,292
someone is always holding a torch.

623
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:07,194
Look at poor Julian, standing there,

624
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:10,030
torch in hand, settling for table scraps

625
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:11,709
because the woman
that he loves is married.

626
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:14,734
I mean, Marvin... he's
just caught in the crossfire.

627
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,303
You sound like an expert.

628
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:18,372
So, which one are you... torchbearer?

629
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:20,073
Or the one getting burned?

630
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,510
I'm done.

631
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:32,686
- Hey.
- Hey.

632
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,690
So, listen,

633
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,059
if you don't like it, I get it.

634
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:40,927
Just forget it, and I'll forget it,

635
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:44,197
and all that really matters
is that we're sisters.

636
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,233
There are rules against operating

637
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:48,368
on people that you love.

638
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,603
There should be a rule against operating

639
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:51,749
on people that you hate.

640
00:24:51,784 --> 00:24:53,406
And I know that "hate" is a strong word,

641
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:55,408
but I... I strongly hate this woman,

642
00:24:55,443 --> 00:24:56,776
and I cannot be the person

643
00:24:56,812 --> 00:24:58,482
who kills the person
that they hate on the table

644
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:03,282
because there is a name for that
and... and a prison sentence.

645
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:06,419
Well, then, why are you
still staring at her scans?

646
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:08,354
'Cause I also can't be
the person who kills her

647
00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:11,326
by not doing something
when I possibly can.

648
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:13,759
Well, can you?

649
00:25:13,794 --> 00:25:15,428
The rate of mortality is 30%

650
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:17,263
just to open up her chest again,

651
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:18,875
and that wouldn't even
let me see the stent.

652
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:20,077
I would have no visualization,

653
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,245
certainly not enough to do the procedure

654
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,370
in the 40 minutes I would have
before she goes brain-dead

655
00:25:24,405 --> 00:25:25,938
from a lack of blood in her body.

656
00:25:26,774 --> 00:25:28,574
Can you put in the stent from below?

657
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,749
That's not how it works.

658
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:31,444
Right, but I'm not asking how it works.

659
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,879
I'm asking, can it be done?

660
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:35,748
I mean...

661
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:37,916
With an intravenous ultrasound,

662
00:25:38,562 --> 00:25:42,655
I suppose the stent could be sent

663
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,389
through the groin

664
00:25:44,424 --> 00:25:47,626
and insert it into the graft from below.

665
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:48,960
Well, that sounds promising.

666
00:25:48,995 --> 00:25:50,473
But someone else would have to do it.

667
00:25:50,497 --> 00:25:51,896
I would have to be at the heart

668
00:25:51,931 --> 00:25:53,831
to connect it to the graft
once it's in place.

669
00:25:53,867 --> 00:25:57,235
It's risky as hell.

670
00:25:57,271 --> 00:25:59,571
And I-I've never done it before.

671
00:25:59,606 --> 00:26:02,140
Well, neither have I,
but it sounds kind of fun.

672
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:04,175
Do you want to assist?

673
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,277
Yeah.

674
00:26:05,312 --> 00:26:06,511
And you have a sister now,

675
00:26:06,546 --> 00:26:08,146
so if that bully gives you any trouble,

676
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:09,481
I got your back.

677
00:26:12,386 --> 00:26:14,986
Well, parade just got added to my list.

678
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:17,822
What list? List of places
I'm terrified to let Harriet go.

679
00:26:17,857 --> 00:26:21,592
I already worry about schools,
malls, parks, concerts. Church.

680
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:23,372
Yeah, this isn't even the
first kid with a gunshot wound

681
00:26:23,396 --> 00:26:24,995
- I treated this week.
- That bad?

682
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,775
Yeah, I don't know why
we let them out of our sight.

683
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,532
Oh, crap, I'm not getting a signal.

684
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:30,345
Fingers are dusky. I need
to get in there right away.

685
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:32,213
- We're not done up here.
- If I wait, he loses the hand.

686
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:33,237
Parker, you're with me.

687
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,880
Sarah, can you prep the arm
while I scrub?

688
00:26:35,441 --> 00:26:37,040
Oh, man, his pressure is dropping...

689
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:38,108
the suture won't hold.

690
00:26:38,143 --> 00:26:40,344
The entire lobe's trashed.
We need to remove it.

691
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:46,016
I called all of her friends... twice.

692
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:49,853
Well, John's finding a hotel.

693
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:52,219
Just in case she comes back.

694
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:53,724
The first time she ran away,

695
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:57,560
I was so terrified,
I could barely breathe.

696
00:26:57,595 --> 00:27:00,663
I can't imagine living with that fear

697
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:03,366
for a year and a half.

698
00:27:05,603 --> 00:27:08,360
Did she say who the father was?

699
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,445
Never a name.

700
00:27:11,108 --> 00:27:12,542
He's not in the picture.

701
00:27:16,378 --> 00:27:17,447
I'm a good mom.

702
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:19,816
I don't know what you must think, but...

703
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:21,651
I don't... I don't think anything.

704
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:25,087
Well...

705
00:27:25,122 --> 00:27:27,671
Britney was a happy kid.

706
00:27:28,592 --> 00:27:30,025
I mean, she...

707
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:33,362
She loved school, loved soccer

708
00:27:33,397 --> 00:27:37,900
and fuzzy socks and cinnamon toast.

709
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:42,004
And then she started using drugs, and...

710
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:45,274
and she just... just became someone

711
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:46,775
I didn't know anymore.

712
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,611
She'd be standing right in front of me,

713
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:51,613
but not there.

714
00:27:54,217 --> 00:27:56,685
I just missed her so much.

715
00:27:58,389 --> 00:28:01,523
I missed her before she ran away.

716
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:05,727
Why would she call me again and say,

717
00:28:05,763 --> 00:28:08,930
"I love you," and, "I'm sorry,"
and, "Come see me,"

718
00:28:08,965 --> 00:28:10,532
and then just...

719
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:13,402
I don't know how I keep doing this.

720
00:28:13,437 --> 00:28:15,136
I don't know.

721
00:28:16,673 --> 00:28:19,040
I don't know if I can keep doing this.

722
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,576
I-I took her in

723
00:28:22,612 --> 00:28:23,911
because I'm an addict, too,

724
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:26,714
and, um, I did all that.

725
00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:29,450
I ran away. I lied.

726
00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:33,454
I broke my mother's heart
over and over again.

727
00:28:33,489 --> 00:28:35,289
But when I got clean,

728
00:28:35,324 --> 00:28:38,325
she was the last person
that I wanted to see.

729
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,594
The shame was too great.

730
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,563
I'm sure you're a good mom,

731
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:44,565
and I promise you,

732
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,435
your little girl is still in there.

733
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:36,181
16 years old.

734
00:29:38,052 --> 00:29:39,518
Ah! Damn it!

735
00:29:39,554 --> 00:29:40,720
Lap pads.

736
00:29:40,756 --> 00:29:42,054
More lap pads.

737
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:43,621
More, more, more, more.

738
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:41,712
Well, it looks like it's docked
in the right position.

739
00:30:41,747 --> 00:30:43,280
We're about to find out.

740
00:30:45,784 --> 00:30:47,684
- Wow.
- It worked?

741
00:30:48,787 --> 00:30:51,354
So, there are no consequences.

742
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:53,289
Did you see Kiki's emergency contact?

743
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:55,625
- No.
- It was blank.

744
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,847
She has no one.

745
00:30:56,882 --> 00:30:58,761
There may not be rules
about who gets to live

746
00:30:58,796 --> 00:30:59,917
and who gets to die,

747
00:30:59,953 --> 00:31:02,599
but she is all alone in this world,

748
00:31:02,634 --> 00:31:04,367
so there are consequences.

749
00:31:16,814 --> 00:31:18,814
He made it through surgery.

750
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,650
He's gonna be okay.

751
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:21,884
We'll take you up to see him.

752
00:31:22,854 --> 00:31:24,887
- Whoo!
- Yes!

753
00:31:24,922 --> 00:31:26,288
Yeah!

754
00:31:30,294 --> 00:31:31,794
We'll keep a close eye on

755
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:34,463
if there's any
neurological changes and...

756
00:31:34,498 --> 00:31:36,231
but the surgery went very well.

757
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:39,434
- Oh, thank God.
- Oh.

758
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:43,139
I don't know what I'd do without her.

759
00:31:43,174 --> 00:31:44,974
Me neither.

760
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:46,942
Do you want to... ?

761
00:31:46,978 --> 00:31:48,744
Uh, you go ahead. I'll be right there.

762
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,813
All right.

763
00:31:50,848 --> 00:31:52,281
Mm-hmm.

764
00:31:54,552 --> 00:31:56,752
I see the look.

765
00:31:56,788 --> 00:31:58,988
The last five years,
any time we're all together,

766
00:31:59,023 --> 00:32:00,522
no one can figure it out...

767
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,659
no one can name it or understand.

768
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:07,362
It's not like you think.

769
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:10,832
Lucille is possessive with me and jealous

770
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:13,468
in a way she just isn't with Julian.

771
00:32:13,504 --> 00:32:16,471
And he's cold and distant
with his girlfriends

772
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:19,040
in a way he would never be with Lucille.

773
00:32:19,076 --> 00:32:21,876
And that's because they made
a decision a long time ago

774
00:32:21,912 --> 00:32:25,280
to let their love be the easy kind.

775
00:32:25,316 --> 00:32:27,182
They let it be friendship.

776
00:32:27,218 --> 00:32:29,984
They never wanted to risk
all that ease between them

777
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,788
on something as fickle
as sex and romance.

778
00:32:33,824 --> 00:32:35,457
I'm Lucille's third husband,

779
00:32:35,492 --> 00:32:37,792
and I hope I'm the last.

780
00:32:37,828 --> 00:32:40,328
But she only has one Julian.

781
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:45,633
And now, if you'll excuse
me, my wife needs me.

782
00:32:57,614 --> 00:33:00,215
- Here you go, Dr. Altman.
- Great. Thank you.

783
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,983
We had to remove the right middle lobe,

784
00:33:02,018 --> 00:33:04,886
but with rehab, the remaining lung

785
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:06,487
will compensate for the loss.

786
00:33:06,522 --> 00:33:09,323
His hand's warm and pink,
which is a great sign.

787
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,191
We repaired the fractures with pins.

788
00:33:11,227 --> 00:33:12,660
But he's gonna be okay.

789
00:33:12,695 --> 00:33:13,939
Just a few weeks in the hospital and...

790
00:33:13,963 --> 00:33:17,265
- Dad?
- Hey, hey, hey.

791
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,400
Hey. I'm here, son.

792
00:33:19,435 --> 00:33:21,869
You're all right. I'm right here.

793
00:33:21,904 --> 00:33:23,871
What happened?

794
00:33:23,906 --> 00:33:25,406
Colin.

795
00:33:27,477 --> 00:33:29,577
My baby boy.

796
00:33:29,612 --> 00:33:32,747
My sweet boy. You're all right.

797
00:33:32,782 --> 00:33:34,882
Excuse me.

798
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:40,388
Hey, Owen. Are... Are you okay?

799
00:33:40,423 --> 00:33:41,533
I need to get up to daycare.

800
00:33:41,557 --> 00:33:42,590
Owen.

801
00:33:43,825 --> 00:33:44,924
Hey.

802
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,794
It's me. Talk to me.

803
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:53,933
Betty's parents are here.

804
00:33:53,968 --> 00:33:55,902
And they didn't know about Leo.

805
00:33:55,937 --> 00:33:57,570
Oh.

806
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,775
I'm gonna lose him, Teddy.

807
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:04,911
I just know I'm gonna lose him.

808
00:34:08,915 --> 00:34:12,417
M.A.P.s are stable.
Chest tube output is minimal.

809
00:34:16,152 --> 00:34:18,585
Well, she was right.
You really are the best.

810
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:20,892
Dr. Nora Lau to the E.R.

811
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:22,832
Dr. Nora Lau to the E.R.

812
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:28,469
Okay, so, now can we talk
about how you feel?

813
00:34:28,504 --> 00:34:30,103
Ugh.

814
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,605
Relieved, mostly.

815
00:34:31,641 --> 00:34:32,641
A little gloaty.

816
00:34:32,642 --> 00:34:33,741
No.

817
00:34:34,477 --> 00:34:36,276
About me and DeLuca.

818
00:34:36,312 --> 00:34:37,478
What?

819
00:34:37,513 --> 00:34:39,179
Maggie, I'm not gonna be a Kiki.

820
00:34:39,215 --> 00:34:40,781
I can't have you smile to my face

821
00:34:40,817 --> 00:34:43,016
and then hate me when
I walk out of the room.

822
00:34:43,052 --> 00:34:44,300
When I told you this morning,

823
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:47,020
you just smiled at me very weirdly.

824
00:34:47,056 --> 00:34:49,122
When you told me what?

825
00:34:49,158 --> 00:34:53,461
That I was thinking about
going on a date with DeLuca.

826
00:34:53,496 --> 00:34:55,663
This morning. I told you that.

827
00:34:55,698 --> 00:34:57,931
Oh. Ohh.

828
00:34:57,967 --> 00:35:01,836
Y-Yeah, I had just read
Kiki Thompson's chart,

829
00:35:01,871 --> 00:35:03,871
I saw her name,
and I was paralyzed with rage.

830
00:35:03,906 --> 00:35:06,173
I did not hear a word you said.

831
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:08,342
DeLuca? Andrew DeLuca? And you?

832
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:09,942
Yes.

833
00:35:09,978 --> 00:35:11,478
Is it weird? It's weird, right?

834
00:35:11,513 --> 00:35:13,546
No, no. It's surprising.

835
00:35:13,582 --> 00:35:15,515
For me, too.

836
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,316
He's a good guy.

837
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:19,218
And if he's ever not a good guy,

838
00:35:19,254 --> 00:35:21,020
I got your back.

839
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:29,061
Yeah, the hotel's sending up
a crib to our room

840
00:35:29,097 --> 00:35:30,241
along with diapers, some formula...

841
00:35:30,265 --> 00:35:32,632
just anything else that we need
to get through the night.

842
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,501
I'm sorry, I don't... What?

843
00:35:34,536 --> 00:35:36,569
Thank you so much for taking care of Leo,

844
00:35:36,605 --> 00:35:37,648
but we've got this now. Wait. What...

845
00:35:37,672 --> 00:35:39,972
We can talk tomorrow
about the rest of his things.

846
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:42,241
- No, wait, you...
- Yeah, you can't take him tonight.

847
00:35:42,277 --> 00:35:43,709
He's... He...

848
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,477
You can't just take him.
He's our grandson.

849
00:35:45,513 --> 00:35:47,078
Yeah, and we're his family,

850
00:35:47,114 --> 00:35:48,144
and he knows us.

851
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,623
We're not letting you leave with him.

852
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,651
Well, I am not leaving him here
with another drug addict!

853
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:58,067
You're not taking Leo anywhere
without a court order.

854
00:35:58,091 --> 00:36:00,692
I'm his legal guardian.
I have sworn to protect him.

855
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:02,071
So I'm not gonna allow two strangers

856
00:36:02,095 --> 00:36:03,194
to just take him.

857
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,329
And if you try,

858
00:36:04,364 --> 00:36:06,331
I will have you arrested for kidnapping.

859
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:11,069
You'll be hearing from us.

860
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:18,201
You told them you were a drug addict?

861
00:36:19,112 --> 00:36:21,378
- Why would you do that?
- I...

862
00:36:21,414 --> 00:36:23,180
I was trying to help.

863
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:24,916
Trying to help who?

864
00:36:25,552 --> 00:36:27,685
Owen, this is a painful
situation for everyone.

865
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,354
Everyone in this situation is in pain.

866
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:32,089
- Please don't...
- Please don't what?

867
00:36:32,124 --> 00:36:33,636
Please don't be upset
that you'd just give them

868
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,300
the one piece of information they can use

869
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:36,594
to take Leo away from me?

870
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:37,940
Owen, you and I are... we're not married.

871
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:39,339
So, if you want to fight for him...

872
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,932
If I want to fight for Leo?

873
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:44,602
Yes, if... if you want
to fight to keep Leo,

874
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:46,081
I am not standing in the way of that.

875
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:47,583
Why would I not want
to fight to keep Leo?

876
00:36:47,607 --> 00:36:49,774
Because you are his foster parent!

877
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:52,443
You said that you want him
to have his mother in his life.

878
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:54,779
You said that you want
what is best for him!

879
00:36:54,814 --> 00:36:56,113
And those are his grandparents!

880
00:36:56,148 --> 00:36:57,254
And Betty is his mother,

881
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:59,248
and she is missing right now, again,

882
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,394
and you don't even seem to care!

883
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:01,558
Her name is Britney,

884
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,931
and she's never been much of a mother!

885
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:03,995
I think we both know that.

886
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:27,802
There's a reason
so many babies' first word

887
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:29,070
is "No."

888
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,042
It's because it's the word
they hear the most.

889
00:38:36,379 --> 00:38:38,379
From the second we are born,

890
00:38:38,414 --> 00:38:42,149
we want to cross the line,
push the boundaries...

891
00:38:42,185 --> 00:38:43,517
- What's up?
- ... test the limits.

892
00:38:43,553 --> 00:38:45,152
A few months ago,

893
00:38:45,188 --> 00:38:47,888
you said you didn't want to be
interim chief anymore.

894
00:38:47,923 --> 00:38:51,358
But at the time,
I was not yet ready to return.

895
00:38:51,394 --> 00:38:54,828
Since then, I've done the work on myself,

896
00:38:54,863 --> 00:38:56,275
I have done the work on my marriage,

897
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:59,900
and now you'll be happy
to hear I'm ready.

898
00:38:59,935 --> 00:39:01,402
I'm ready to be chief again,

899
00:39:01,437 --> 00:39:03,437
so you are off the hook.

900
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:05,839
Look, I-I-I sucked
when I started this job.

901
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:07,386
I mean, I-I couldn't eat,
I couldn't sleep,

902
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,743
- and... and I felt like a big joke.
- No comment.

903
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:12,579
But somewhere along the way,

904
00:39:12,614 --> 00:39:14,114
I got good at it.

905
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:15,615
I like it now.

906
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,016
I mean, I kicked this job's ass,

907
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:18,218
just like Webber told me to.

908
00:39:18,253 --> 00:39:19,685
- Webber?
- Yeah.

909
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:21,554
Plus, it's way more money.

910
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,678
So the answer is no.

911
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:27,227
Oh, I-I wasn't asking so much as telling.

912
00:39:27,262 --> 00:39:28,828
And I'm telling you no.

913
00:39:29,764 --> 00:39:32,198
I mean, we agreed to
a six-month contract, Bailey.

914
00:39:32,234 --> 00:39:33,252
That's what I signed.

915
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,202
When it's over, it's all yours.

916
00:39:38,573 --> 00:39:42,041
I didn't even expect you
to survive your intern year.

917
00:39:42,076 --> 00:39:43,309
What?

918
00:39:43,345 --> 00:39:45,825
I'm saying I'm proud of you, Karev.

919
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:54,986
But then we grow up and learn
that not all rules are bad.

920
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,832
Hey.

921
00:40:07,868 --> 00:40:09,334
Hey.

922
00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:13,938
Look, uh... there are certain friendships

923
00:40:13,974 --> 00:40:16,141
that are meant to be
just that... friendships,

924
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:19,778
even if the feelings are so big, and...

925
00:40:19,813 --> 00:40:21,157
You didn't have to come to my hotel room

926
00:40:21,181 --> 00:40:22,847
to tell me we're just friends.

927
00:40:22,883 --> 00:40:26,151
That's, like, a "leave a note at
the front desk" kind of thing.

928
00:40:26,186 --> 00:40:29,187
No, that's... that's...

929
00:40:31,224 --> 00:40:33,291
What I'm... What I'm saying is

930
00:40:33,326 --> 00:40:34,957
I'm saying...

931
00:40:36,163 --> 00:40:37,762
Owen and I are supposed to be friends.

932
00:40:37,798 --> 00:40:40,765
I mean, we... we are just friends.

933
00:40:40,801 --> 00:40:43,301
Very close friends, but...

934
00:40:46,073 --> 00:40:48,339
You and I are...

935
00:40:48,374 --> 00:40:50,374
You and I are... ?

936
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,344
Something else. We are...

937
00:40:53,379 --> 00:40:55,879
Some boundaries protect us.

938
00:40:55,915 --> 00:40:58,349
Some lines keep us safe.

939
00:40:58,384 --> 00:41:01,385
Tom, I am... I am really pregnant.

940
00:41:03,656 --> 00:41:05,863
I ordered a club sandwich.

941
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:08,693
I mean... e-extra bacon.

942
00:41:08,728 --> 00:41:10,160
You must be hungry.

943
00:41:10,196 --> 00:41:11,295
Yeah.

944
00:41:11,331 --> 00:41:12,331
Come on.

945
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,235
But the nice thing
about being an adult is

946
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,169
we can choose for ourselves.

947
00:41:19,205 --> 00:41:20,434
- Hey.
- Hey.

948
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,172
You, uh, paged me?

949
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,309
Yes.

950
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:28,010
You are not taking me out tonight.

951
00:41:28,046 --> 00:41:29,979
God, is this...

952
00:41:30,014 --> 00:41:31,080
Is this Maggie?

953
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:32,765
Do I need to talk to her now?

954
00:41:33,418 --> 00:41:35,418
Unbelievable.

955
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:37,820
I have three kids,

956
00:41:37,856 --> 00:41:40,257
and I'm not getting on
the back of a motorcycle.

957
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:42,492
So I'm driving. So where is
this place with the view?

958
00:41:42,527 --> 00:41:44,494
We can screw the rules...

959
00:41:44,529 --> 00:41:45,762
Okay, then.

960
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:47,238
My treat.

961
00:41:47,898 --> 00:41:50,566
... or we can make our own.

PREVIOUSLY ON: Grey's Anatomy"

2
00:00:04,513 --> 00:00:06,513
I'm pregnant, with your baby.

3
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:09,629
Dr Grey, you don't squeeze all the love

4
00:00:09,654 --> 00:00:13,056
and joy you care out of this
one life you've been given,

5
00:00:13,102 --> 00:00:15,102
I'm gonna haunt you from my grave.

6
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:17,188
- Yes.
- Yes to...?

7
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:18,247
Drinks.

8
00:00:18,248 --> 00:00:20,853
You gave up your job and your husband.

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,476
You need to get some help.

10
00:00:22,477 --> 00:00:24,477
I'm so sorry. It's your mom.

11
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:32,987
- What?
- What?

12
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:35,189
- Did you hear that?
- Oh, my God. We're gonna die in here.

13
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:37,124
But if this is how I die,

14
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:39,226
it's okay.

15
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:43,197
We all need a place to feel safe.

16
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,901
To feel sheltered. Protected.

17
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:50,492
For most people, it means a home.

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,340
For most surgeons, it means a hospital.

19
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,642
I don't care if
100 utility poles are down.

20
00:00:55,677 --> 00:00:57,244
You need to get the damn lights back on.

21
00:00:57,278 --> 00:00:58,506
No, I don't.

22
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,880
That's what the generators are for.

23
00:00:59,914 --> 00:01:01,515
Well, then, why aren't they doing it?

24
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:04,184
'Cause it takes them
a little while to kick in.

25
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:07,254
See?

26
00:01:07,288 --> 00:01:09,056
That's why I'm in charge of the building.

27
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:12,359
Smug. That's smug.

28
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:14,895
I don't care for it.

29
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,364
In the hospital, we're rarely blindsided.

30
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:18,999
This is weird.

31
00:01:19,034 --> 00:01:22,069
The power's back on, but are we moving?

32
00:01:22,103 --> 00:01:23,504
Do you feel like we're moving?

33
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:26,206
And there's always something
to keep us busy.

34
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:27,608
What?

35
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:29,574
- It doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter?

36
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:31,912
I just mean that no one's asking
for anything from you.

37
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:36,517
No one's asking for you
to give up anything or... anyone.

38
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:38,685
- It's just you needed to know.
- What?

39
00:01:44,492 --> 00:01:46,193
Teddy's pregnant.

40
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:51,432
It's yours?

41
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:53,981
We always know what to do nex.

42
00:01:54,803 --> 00:01:55,936
Okay!

43
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,271
It's a cozy little box.

44
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:05,712
I, uh, think we're stuck.

45
00:02:05,747 --> 00:02:08,082
I can't be. I have to be in surgery.

46
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:10,217
I have to procure a heart for Cece.

47
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:12,419
Maggie is waiting for us.

48
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:13,821
I can't be in here.

49
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:16,824
You got to get us out of here.

50
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:20,060
All right, uh...

51
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:21,695
I have a transplant!

52
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:25,165
Okay.

53
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,433
What are you doing?

54
00:02:26,468 --> 00:02:28,969
Well, under this light fixture,

55
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:31,171
there should be a trap door somewhere.

56
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:32,673
What? No!

57
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:36,243
You're not doing some action-hero crap

58
00:02:36,277 --> 00:02:38,145
where you climb up an elevator shaft.

59
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:39,847
I meant use your phone.

60
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:42,501
- Well, I don't get any signal in here.
- Well, neither do I.

61
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:43,815
Then why did you ask me
to get us out of here?

62
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,653
Because I...

63
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,030
...can't be in here!

64
00:02:52,284 --> 00:02:53,427
Help!

65
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,103
So, um, her spine, then?

66
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:05,472
Chondrosarcoma.

67
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:06,940
C5 to T1.

68
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:08,909
Extensive local invasion.

69
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,312
When did she tell you?

70
00:03:12,347 --> 00:03:13,647
Why... Why did she tell you?

71
00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:15,349
She didn't.

72
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:18,385
She doesn't want anyone to know yet.

73
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,517
But I couldn't know this
without telling you.

74
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,191
Especially you.

75
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,329
What do I do?

76
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:31,198
- I feel, uh...
- Helpless.

77
00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:32,966
I know.

78
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:37,237
I've never felt less
like a doctor in my life.

79
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:45,812
Oh, no. My... My patient, Cece.

80
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:48,215
She's in the O.R.
Her pressure is dropping.

81
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:50,517
Go.

82
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:53,153
- Whatever I can do...
- Go. Go.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

84
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:08,235
- Cece, what's going on?
- Her pressure keeps dropping.

85
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:09,436
We started her on pressors again.

86
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,372
My old heart is jealous of my new one.

87
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:14,374
It seems to want to quit on me.

88
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:16,276
Well, then, we're just in time.

89
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:18,245
Titrate the drip to keep
her MAPs above 50.

90
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,712
Qadri, go to O.R. 2

91
00:04:19,746 --> 00:04:21,215
and see how Dr. Bailey's doing
on the procurement.

92
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:23,450
- I need to know how far out we are.
- Got it.

93
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:40,901
What do we do?

94
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:42,302
What do we do?

95
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:44,271
We keep doing what we're doing.

96
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:45,626
You pump the bag.

97
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,976
Get the O2 in the blood,
keep the organs viable,

98
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,169
and we... wait.

99
00:04:52,203 --> 00:04:53,163
But we're trapped.

100
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:56,483
- Not trapped, delayed.
- We can't be!

101
00:04:56,517 --> 00:04:58,552
Cece's in the O.R. right now.
We have to get these organs...

102
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:00,487
- Helm, get your head together.
- It's just, uh,

103
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:02,489
she's been waiting for this,
and she's, uh...

104
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:08,562
God, I... I think I'm...

105
00:05:08,596 --> 00:05:10,897
I think I'm having a panic attack.

106
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:12,432
No, no.

107
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:14,234
You're not. S-Stop it.

108
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:15,502
Do you understand me?

109
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:18,405
No one is having a panic attack.

110
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:32,853
- Is anybody out there?!
- Help!

111

112
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:43,113
So, I don't understand.
You've been here since...

113
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:44,419
Weeks. Weeks. For weeks.

114
00:05:44,454 --> 00:05:45,748
- Yeah, a long time.
- Did you just find out?

115
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:49,116
No, no. You knew.
That's why you came here.

116
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:51,946
- Because you were pregnant, and you...
- Yes, yes, I-I knew for a while.

117
00:05:51,946 --> 00:05:53,480
- And you didn't tell me?
- I did tell you.

118
00:05:53,514 --> 00:05:54,848
Just now!

119
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,549
He's bottomed out.

120
00:05:58,719 --> 00:05:59,986
Uh, I don't feel a pulse.

121
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,588
Maybe it's a cardiac tamponade?

122
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:03,723
Maybe the plate punctured his heart.

123
00:06:03,757 --> 00:06:05,191
All right, well, if it has,
compressions aren't gonna help.

124
00:06:05,226 --> 00:06:06,505
We have got to get him into an O.R.

125
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:09,095
Hey! Hey!

126
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:10,763
Guys, guys, guys, we don't have time.

127
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:11,931
Worst-case scenario
is the door won't open

128
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:13,099
till after he's dead.

129
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,501
Yeah, we have to open him up.

130
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:16,202
- In here?
- In here.

131
00:06:16,237 --> 00:06:17,904
Look around and see what
we have to work with.

132
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:20,273
- Uh, two units of extra blood.
- Great, do we have a...

133
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:22,275
- Test tube tray.
- Jackpot. I've got a scalpel.

134
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:23,659
All right, Shepherd,
can you bag him, please?

135
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:26,012
- We're really doing this?
- Yes. Come on.

136
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:27,914
Trauma is the choice
between doing something

137
00:06:27,948 --> 00:06:29,048
that could maybe kill him...

138
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,383
Or doing nothing...

139
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,252
- ...which will really kill him.
- ...which will really kill him.

140
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:34,020
Hey, we're not going anywhere,

141
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:36,689
so what else do we have to do?

142
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:43,530
You're supposed to be honeymooning.

143
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:45,131
And you're supposed to be sleeping.

144
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:46,733
Look, they opened the bridge.

145
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:47,967
The storm's calming down.

146
00:06:48,002 --> 00:06:49,969
- Come back to bed.
- Oh, come on, Jo.

147
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:51,070
It's a basket of crap over there.

148
00:06:51,105 --> 00:06:52,086
No, no, it's fine.

149
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,181
- No, it's not fine.
- Mm, it is.

150
00:06:53,215 --> 00:06:55,275
A pole fell down in the ambulance bay.

151
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:57,110
- You're kidding.
- No, no, no. The power went out.

152
00:06:57,144 --> 00:06:58,645
- The... The elevators aren't working.
- No.

153
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,813
We've got doctors and we've
got patients trapped.

154
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:03,149
- Bailey will have...
- Bailey... trapped.

155
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:04,298
On an elevator.

156
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,553
- We should go.
- No, I should go.

157
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:08,755
- You're drunk.
- Okay, you should go.

158
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,993
Stop that.

159
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:15,460
Stop what?

160
00:07:15,996 --> 00:07:17,497
Looking at me.

161
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:20,099
It's a small room.
There's not a lot to look at.

162
00:07:21,468 --> 00:07:23,303
You know what I mean.

163
00:07:23,337 --> 00:07:24,610
Okay.

164
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:27,540
I'll stand over here
where I can't look at you.

165
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:32,745
I just hate not knowing

166
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,013
what's going on out there.

167
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:35,615
I can tell you
what's going on out there...

168
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,116
Maggie's probably already started

169
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:38,117
on Cece's heart transplant

170
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:42,121
'cause Bailey or Webber
or literally anyone else

171
00:07:42,156 --> 00:07:43,222
already did the organ recovery.

172
00:07:43,257 --> 00:07:46,074
And that same person is gonna do
the kidney transplant.

173
00:07:46,894 --> 00:07:48,861
You're a brilliant surgeon, Meredith,

174
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:52,122
but this procedure
only requires a surgeon.

175
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,267
Thanks, I think.

176
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:58,471
Thank you.

177
00:08:04,078 --> 00:08:05,845
It's like the TARDIS from "Doctor Who."

178
00:08:06,847 --> 00:08:09,515
It that some nerd thing?
Because I'm not fluent.

179
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,883
No, I mean, me neither,

180
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:13,052
but I used to watch it
when I was a kid in Italy.

181
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:15,488
"Doctor Who" had this,

182
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:17,624
uh, phone booth that was a time machine,

183
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:19,779
and when you stepped inside,
you were, like,

184
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,361
outside of time and space.

185
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:22,829
And the world went on,

186
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:26,489
but you were in this whole other
little... bubble...

187
00:08:27,568 --> 00:08:31,204
a secret place where
the normal rules don't apply.

188
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:41,247
The rule still apply.

189
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:42,882
This isn't the Turdis.

190
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,017
TARDIS.

191
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:45,425
Whatever.

192
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,722
Call the Fire Department and have
them get those elevators open!

193
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:51,824
- They're not coming.
- They're not coming?

194
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,593
They're on limited operations
because of the storm.

195
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:55,328
Look, I don't know
why you're yelling at me.

196
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:57,163
Because the damn building isn't working,

197
00:08:57,197 --> 00:08:59,332
and you're in charge
of the damn building!

198
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:00,633
Do better!

199
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:12,245
This is Catherine Fox.
Please leave a message.

200
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,412
Uh...

201
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:17,183
Y-Y-You're Betty, right?

202
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:19,252
- You need some help to find someone?
- Oh, no. That's okay.

203
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:21,554
I was just waiting
for Dr. Shepherd to get back.

204
00:09:21,588 --> 00:09:24,557
I just got a bit restless,
you know, in the E.R.

205
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:26,259
Right, right.

206
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:31,297
Um, you know what?

207
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:32,899
I'm little bit antsy myself.

208
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,233
I mean, I find the best thing to do

209
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:35,813
is to help someone else.

210
00:09:35,848 --> 00:09:37,127
Got a lot of patients here

211
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,805
and none of the elevators are working.

212
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,864
- I need to stay busy, and so do you.
- That's okay. I can just...

213
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:43,242
Now, come on.
Let's make ourselves useful.

214
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:47,380
This is Catherine Fox.

215
00:09:47,414 --> 00:09:49,582
Please leave a message.

216
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:51,317
Mom, it's me again. Call me, all right?

217
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:53,086
Tell me where you are
and what I can do to help.

218
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Do you know where Dr. Bailey is?!

219
00:09:54,154 --> 00:09:55,388
Qadri, what is going on?

220
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:57,223
Dr. Bailey is in an elevator.

221
00:09:57,257 --> 00:09:58,991
You just asked me where she is.

222
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:01,227
Cece Colvin's on the table
for a transplant.

223
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:03,497
Dr. Bailey is stuck in an
elevator with the donor organs.

224
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:04,577
Dr. Pierce wants me to find them,

225
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:05,560
but I don't know how I'm gonna do that.

226
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:07,293
- Coming through. What?
- Hey!

227
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:08,835
The elevators...
I need you to open them up.

228
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:10,503
- I can't. The elevators are down.
- I know that.

229
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:13,439
They're computerized, okay?
So they need a while to reset.

230
00:10:13,474 --> 00:10:15,174
- They'll be back up eventually.
- We don't have till "eventually."

231
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:16,743
I'm asking you how they get opened.

232
00:10:16,777 --> 00:10:18,935
Well, I'd call the elevator guy,
but he's not coming.

233
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:19,979
You know, there's
a hell of a storm out there.

234
00:10:20,013 --> 00:10:22,181
Yes, I r... Is there anything by chance

235
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:23,282
that you know that I don't?

236
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:25,118
Oh!

237
00:10:25,152 --> 00:10:26,352
Okay, Doctor. No, I don't know.

238
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:27,487
Can you tell me

239
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:29,122
how many ground fault circuit
interrupters it takes

240
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:30,323
to keep you from getting fried

241
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:32,358
every time you reach for a defibrillator?

242
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:33,426
No, you can't.

243
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,261
You just pick it up and say, "Clear!"

244
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:37,163
and somehow you're a hero.

245
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:38,765
'Cause doctors are so cool.

246
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:45,171
Don't hyperventilate.

247
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:46,332
I'm not. I'm okay.

248
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:48,841
Don't hyperventilate the patient.

249
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:50,176
Oh, sorry.

250
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:54,847
I just, uh, think we're gonna plummet

251
00:10:54,882 --> 00:10:57,517
and, uh, Cece will die

252
00:10:57,551 --> 00:11:00,686
and Phoebe never got a chance
to say goodbye to her mother,

253
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:02,288
and she would have died for nothing...

254
00:11:02,322 --> 00:11:04,123
with a stupid selfie stick in her face...

255
00:11:04,158 --> 00:11:06,094
and this thing's gonna plummet
and we're gonna plummet with it!

256
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:07,693
They say if you jump
as it hits the ground,

257
00:11:07,728 --> 00:11:09,495
- we might be okay, but...
- That's nonsense.

258
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,231
- It's basic physics. You can't...
- Right.

259
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:15,134
First... First, we'll hit the ceiling,

260
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:18,638
and then we'll smash into
the floor like tomatoes.

261
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:20,506
We'll just be a puddle of us.

262
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:21,707
Nobody's plummeting.

263
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:24,210
These things plummet all the time.

264
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:26,646
In movies, not in buildings.

265
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,847
Do you know that?

266
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:30,249
There's special brakes and things.

267
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:31,317
How... How do you know that?

268
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:32,919
I don't know that! I made it up.

269
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:35,254
'Cause if our brains are
determined to scare us to death

270
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:38,224
with made-up scenarios where
everyone we care about dies

271
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:40,326
and we are turned into tomato sauce,

272
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,229
then why can't they
also make us feel good

273
00:11:43,263 --> 00:11:44,530
about made-up good things?

274
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:46,599
Like, uh, hydraulic air brakes.

275
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:49,402
And stop inflating that woman!

276
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:58,945
What if we, uh...
we all breathe together?

277
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:00,513
Okay?

278
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:02,782
Should, uh... Should we do that?

279
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:04,417
In.

280
00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:08,419
And out.

281
00:12:10,757 --> 00:12:12,507
In.

282
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:17,463
And out.

283
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:21,801
I was gonna tell you sooner.

284
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:23,536
I was gonna tell you
the night that I got here,

285
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,305
but you had already started a family.

286
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,474
- In record time.
- Nice.

287
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:30,476
Well, is it not true?

288
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,711
It was a little snarky.

289
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:33,379
Decompressing the pericardium.

290
00:12:35,682 --> 00:12:37,216
I'm sorry.

291
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:39,385
I-I-It was a little snarky. You're right.

292
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:40,553
- This is a clamshell.
- Mm-hmm.

293
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:43,022
Yes, it is a total clam...

294
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:45,473
- Is that like a cluster
- I can't see where

295
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,626
the bleeding is coming from.

296
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,161
Yeah, the incision...
we do a clamshell incision.

297
00:12:49,196 --> 00:12:50,296
- We need more visibility.
- Right.

298
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,898
Yes. I knew that.

299
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:54,400
I've just been very specialized
for a very long time.

300
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:55,468
It basically means we, uh,

301
00:12:55,502 --> 00:12:57,069
pop his chest like the hood of a car.

302
00:12:57,104 --> 00:12:58,404
All right, Owen, uh, grab the scalpel...

303
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:00,006
- we'll do the right thoracotomy.
- Yep.

304
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,341
We're gonna need to find
something to crack that sternum.

305
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:05,077
Yeah, I'm thinking
I'll, uh, figure it out.

306
00:13:06,446 --> 00:13:09,448
And so Carina stayed back with my father,

307
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:11,083
and I moved out here with my mom.

308
00:13:13,987 --> 00:13:15,288
Why did your mom leave?

309
00:13:15,322 --> 00:13:17,657
I... My dad is, uh...

310
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:20,993
was a pretty famous surgeon
back in Italy.

311
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,412
Wow.

312
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:26,596
I wouldn't know anything

313
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:28,167
about having famous surgeon parents.

314
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:30,870
You wouldn't.

315
00:13:30,904 --> 00:13:31,938
Your mom got awards.

316
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:34,373
My dad got... acquittals.

317
00:13:42,516 --> 00:13:44,984
I've never really told anyone about him.

318
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:51,824
Oh, well... you can if you want to.

319
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:53,459
I don't think that I do.

320
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:55,394
I mean, I just meant that
you could if you wanted to

321
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:57,263
and it wouldn't leave this room.

322
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:00,967
Because I don't think
we're ever leaving this room.

323
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:10,943
_

324
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:14,769
_

325
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,770
_

326
00:14:16,863 --> 00:14:20,218
_

327
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,889
_

328
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:29,185
_

329
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:35,701
But he's also the man

330
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:38,537
who took me on the back of his motorbike

331
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:41,207
and taught me how to kick a soccer ball,

332
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:43,542
taught me the names of the stars.

333
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:45,678
So, it's complicated.

334
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:51,584
There. I told somebody.

335
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:56,589
Thanks.

336
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:10,236
Do you really think there's
a trap door up there?

337
00:15:21,044 --> 00:15:21,977
Uh...

338
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:24,179
I just came in here to
get out of the wind.

339
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:26,481
- Same.
- Same.

340
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,328
Well, I should get back in there.

341
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,291
And you should get back in there, too!

342
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:37,392
Now!

343
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:38,963
- Yep.
- Yes, sir.

344
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:43,536
Done.

345
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:45,000
All right. How are we
gonna crack the sternum?

346
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:47,268
I got that. We're gonna lose
that heart monitor.

347
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:48,470
- Why?
- Why?

348
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:49,705
To crack the sternum,

349
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:50,706
I usually use a Lebsche knife

350
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,040
and hit it with a mallet.

351
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:54,376
But we don't have either,
and that battery

352
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,245
is heavy enough to use as a mallet.

353
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,014
And the Lebsche knife?

354
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,917
I'm gonna need you to put
pressure right there

355
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:04,386
- when I pull this out.
- You're gonna use the license plate?

356
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,755
Fun. Great idea, Hunt.

357
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:08,523
Okay. Ready?

358
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:11,026
1... 2... 3!

359
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,394
Aah!

360
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:15,063
Okay.

361
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:19,735
So, what did you mean...

362
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,670
What did you mean when you said

363
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:23,572
"Nobody wants me to do anything"?

364
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:25,907
Do you think maybe

365
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:27,909
we might want to wait to talk
about that until we're...

366
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:29,211
No, no. I'm - I'm...

367
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:30,846
I'm interested, too.

368
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,748
Is he supposed to choose now or...?

369
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:34,349
No! No, no, no.

370
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:36,284
There... There is no choice.

371
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:38,387
Owen, you and I are off the table.

372
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:41,957
So you and Amelia can just...
be whatever you want.

373
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:43,458
Hey, thanks.

374
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:45,127
But I am gonna stay in Seattle.

375
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:46,862
I mean, my child deserves two parents,

376
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:48,397
and I deserve my friend.

377
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:51,767
And so you can stay with Amelia.

378
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,568
Who is right here.

379
00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:56,204
- Okay. You ready to go?
- Yes.

380
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:57,739
Oh!

381
00:16:57,774 --> 00:16:58,874
Oh, God! Wow.

382
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:00,526
Great.

383
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:05,213
- Okay.
- Here you go.

384
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:06,715
- Ready?
- Get ready.

385
00:17:06,749 --> 00:17:08,784
1, 2, 3.

386
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:09,818
All right.

387
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:11,386
Oh, I love brain surgery.

388
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,555
Okay. All right,
the left heart looks good.

389
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,724
Sometimes, there's only
like a teaspoon of blood.

390
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:18,660
I feel like, if I can
get clean for like three months,

391
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:20,629
then I can get it
under control, you know?

392
00:17:20,663 --> 00:17:22,898
Get Leo back.
Just sort of get my life back.

393
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:25,834
Betty, just take it one day at a time,

394
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:28,770
and don't ever make the mistake
of thinking you're cured.

395
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:30,305
That sucks.

396
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:32,074
If you do it alone, it sucks.

397
00:17:32,108 --> 00:17:34,776
But if you let people help you,
it's not bad at all.

398
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,933
Ah, I've got a patient coding.

399
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:40,059
- Can you...
- That's cool.

400
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:43,618
Can I go back to the E.R.?
Just see what else I can do?

401
00:17:43,653 --> 00:17:45,620
Yeah, you do that. Mm.

402
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:54,603
Hello?

403
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:55,764
- Hello?
- Hello?

404
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:57,799
Anybody there?

405
00:17:57,834 --> 00:17:59,534
- You good?
- Shh.

406
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:00,535
Hello? Hey!

407
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,670
- Hello!
- In here!

408
00:18:01,704 --> 00:18:02,771
Great! They're in here!

409
00:18:02,805 --> 00:18:03,841
There are transplant organs
trapped in this elevator.

410
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:06,208
Give us a hand. Let's get this open.

411
00:18:08,077 --> 00:18:09,711
Whoa, hey, hey!

412
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:10,793
What do you guys think you're doing?

413
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:12,047
- Trying to get this open.
- No, no, no.

414
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:14,449
You can't access a stalled elevator car.

415
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:15,417
Someone can get killed.

416
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,519
If we don't, someone will get killed.

417
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,153
How the hell do we open this thing?

418
00:18:20,857 --> 00:18:22,124
Look out.

419
00:18:22,158 --> 00:18:23,358
Don't do that.

420
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:24,326
No. No, no, no, no!

421
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,062
Aw, come on! Can you see that?

422
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:28,563
You guys just do whatever you want.

423
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:29,731
You got no respect for the facility.

424
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:30,766
Hey, listen to me, all right?

425
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,734
You want to be a hero?
You want to save lives?

426
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:33,802
There's a woman whose life depends

427
00:18:33,836 --> 00:18:35,737
on you getting that door open
for us right now.

428
00:18:35,772 --> 00:18:37,172
I can't do that. I'm useless here.

429
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:38,373
You're gonna help me do it.

430
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:39,441
We're gonna get Cece her organs,

431
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:40,709
or you're gonna wake up
tomorrow without a job.

432
00:18:40,743 --> 00:18:41,812
Whoa, hold on a second.

433
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:43,554
Cece the... the matchmaker lady, Cece?

434
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:44,613
- Yes.
- Yes.

435
00:18:44,647 --> 00:18:46,681
- Oh, she...
- I-I was in her room

436
00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:48,817
for just like 15 minutes once
fixing her TV,

437
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:50,552
and she sized me up and introduced me

438
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:52,387
to a nurse down in critical care.

439
00:18:52,421 --> 00:18:53,922
We've been together ever since.

440
00:18:53,956 --> 00:18:55,390
She changed my life, that lady.

441
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:58,260
She, uh, put, uh, joy in my life.

442
00:18:58,294 --> 00:19:00,362
Pardon me. May I borrow this?

443
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:04,432
That guy has joy in his life?

444
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:06,168
Or maybe her name is Joy?

445
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:07,936
It's not coming.

446
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,004
Watch out.

447
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:15,343
There we go.

448
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:22,350
- Come on! You got this.
- You got this! That's it!

449
00:19:25,655 --> 00:19:27,255
It's like "Lord of the friggin'
Flies" in here.

450
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,124
- What happened?
- Bailey's in there with donor organs.

451
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:30,559
They're for Cece.

452
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:37,399
Hey.

453
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:38,934
Karev.

454
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:40,101
Welcome.

455
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:43,772
This is the last unit of blood.

456
00:19:43,806 --> 00:19:45,640
- Do you want me to take over?
- I got it. Thanks.

457
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:49,778
How long?

458
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:51,980
Oh, I'd say about five more minutes

459
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:53,815
with this unit of blood
unless the door opens.

460
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,983
How far along are you?

461
00:19:58,421 --> 00:20:00,622
16 weeks.

462
00:20:00,656 --> 00:20:02,224
And did... Have you had...

463
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:03,825
Have you been to appointments or...?

464
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,262
Yes, we're... we're fine.

465
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:10,067
Baby's fine. I'm fine.

466
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,968
So, you know if it's a...

467
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:15,937
No. Not yet.

468
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:24,412
I'm so sorry.
I should have told you soon...

469
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,814
You think?

470
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:28,083
This is not the way... Do you
think that this is the way

471
00:20:28,117 --> 00:20:29,150
- I wanted to do this?
- I-I-I don't know.

472
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:31,620
I don't know. You seem to
know what everybody wants.

473
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:34,990
Do you feel anything?

474
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:36,958
There should be, like,
a-a handle or something.

475
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:38,326
It might be a keyhole.

476
00:20:38,361 --> 00:20:39,928
Like, it feels like I need a key.

477
00:20:39,962 --> 00:20:41,997
Damn it.

478
00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:48,770
Remind me again why this
is such a bad idea for us.

479
00:20:48,804 --> 00:20:50,171
Because it's a bad idea.

480
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:52,707
No, I hear you. I'm just asking why.

481
00:20:52,742 --> 00:20:56,044
Because I'm an attending,
and you're a resident.

482
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:58,213
And that happens all the time.

483
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:00,649
It's happened for you, I think.

484
00:21:00,683 --> 00:21:03,952
Well, I'm trying to learn
from my mistakes.

485
00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:06,354
I promise not to tell your kids
that you called them that.

486
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:10,358
My marriage and my kids aren't a mistake.

487
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:14,195
Then what are you learning exactly?

488
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:18,099
I don't know.

489
00:21:20,736 --> 00:21:23,004
Just go back to speaking Italian.

490
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,642
I liked it better.

491
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:29,844
_

492
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,608
_

493
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:35,806
_

494
00:21:37,586 --> 00:21:43,052
_

495
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,431
Wow.

496
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:51,366
Yeah.

497
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:08,941
I was the one who said
let's talk about this later

498
00:22:08,976 --> 00:22:10,079
so that you didn't have to do this now...

499
00:22:10,104 --> 00:22:11,186
Well, I have a stake in this.

500
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,021
- I have children here, too. We do.
- I know. I know.

501
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,856
- I have children. We both do.
- I understand that. I know, I just...

502
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:15,924
Can we all just...

503
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:21,262
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

504
00:22:23,165 --> 00:22:24,933
Watch out. All right, great.

505
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:27,035
Coming through!

506
00:22:32,074 --> 00:22:33,708
- All right, you're next.
- Uh...

507
00:22:34,777 --> 00:22:36,111
What if, when I'm halfway through,

508
00:22:36,145 --> 00:22:38,079
it plummets and chops me in half?

509
00:22:38,114 --> 00:22:39,814
Helm! Come get this patient

510
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:41,816
and her life-giving organs to the O.R.

511
00:22:41,851 --> 00:22:44,552
Yes, ma'am.

512
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,492
All right. Let's get her to O.R. 2.

513
00:22:50,526 --> 00:22:51,993
Uh, we need some help with the stairs.

514
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:52,994
- Yeah, we got it.
- Ow.

515
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:54,562
Oh, hey.

516
00:22:54,597 --> 00:22:55,663
Ooh. We got you.

517
00:22:55,698 --> 00:22:56,765
No, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

518
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,933
Go help Cece. Go!

519
00:23:01,804 --> 00:23:02,904
Oh, God!

520
00:23:02,938 --> 00:23:04,139
No, no, no, no!

521
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:05,440
Oh, God! Oh, God!

522
00:23:10,227 --> 00:23:13,573
Hit the button! Hit it!

523
00:23:21,551 --> 00:23:22,551
Is it bad?

524
00:23:22,577 --> 00:23:24,544
Are they gone?

525
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:25,846
We got you, Jed.

526
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,414
We got you, buddy. Okay?

527
00:23:28,883 --> 00:23:30,784
What is the deal with this elevator?

528
00:23:30,818 --> 00:23:32,252
I'm screwed. I'm getting fired.

529
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,220
Barely been here,

530
00:23:33,254 --> 00:23:35,188
and this is my first
impression on the Chief.

531
00:23:35,223 --> 00:23:37,190
Please, I've been making
impressions for months,

532
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:38,725
and they're all this bad or worse.

533
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:40,227
I am getting fire.

534
00:23:48,436 --> 00:23:50,737
This is not a good sign.

535
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:52,806
Mnh. Mnh-mnh.

536
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,543
Let's start her on some norepi.

537
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:59,112
It's getting cold in here.

538
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,881
Shouldn't we be getting started?

539
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:02,966
Not much longer, okay?

540
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:09,089
How's Dr. Avery?

541
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:11,057
Cece.

542
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:14,461
Maggie, this is not normal.

543
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:18,440
I have received organs before.

544
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,434
And this is not a normal amount of time

545
00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:23,203
to wait in an O.R.

546
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,700
There's a problem.

547
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:31,218
And I'm frightened.

548
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:36,041
Because I've loved this life,

549
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:40,954
and I don't know for sure what's next.

550
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:44,716
I'm frightened.

551
00:24:45,793 --> 00:24:47,970
It might help me

552
00:24:48,462 --> 00:24:50,681
to be a little less frightened

553
00:24:51,632 --> 00:24:55,135
if you talked to me
about you and Dr. Avery.

554
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:57,971
Okay. Okay.

555
00:24:58,005 --> 00:25:00,807
Dr. Avery and I are
kind of a mess right now.

556
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:03,643
We had a big fight, and, um,

557
00:25:03,678 --> 00:25:05,879
I don't really know where we stand.

558
00:25:05,913 --> 00:25:07,614
I feel like he could...

559
00:25:07,648 --> 00:25:11,218
I feel like we could
fall apart at any minute.

560
00:25:11,252 --> 00:25:12,452
I don't think I'm...

561
00:25:12,486 --> 00:25:14,521
You don't feel safe.

562
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:15,831
Mm-hmm.

563
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:17,691
Yeah.

564
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,993
In my experience,

565
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:22,254
that means one of two things...

566
00:25:23,497 --> 00:25:26,800
either he is terrible for you

567
00:25:27,768 --> 00:25:29,803
or he's so good for you,

568
00:25:29,837 --> 00:25:32,872
you're scared you'll lose him.

569
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:36,543
Was there ever a time
he made you feel safe?

570
00:25:40,448 --> 00:25:42,148
When my mother died.

571
00:25:45,786 --> 00:25:47,721
That's a good time to do it.

572
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,865
Yeah.

573
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:53,893
Cece, no! No!

574
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:56,062
Crash cart! And tube her. Now!

575
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,832
I had panic attacks as a kid.

576
00:25:58,866 --> 00:26:01,201
Before dance recitals.
And... And spelling bees.

577
00:26:01,235 --> 00:26:03,903
But, also, I-I really thought
that elevator was gonna plummet.

578
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,405
I need you to stop!

579
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,742
Good. You're here.

580
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:09,843
What is it, Karev?

581
00:26:09,877 --> 00:26:11,144
We need to get the maintenance
guy down to the O.R.

582
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:14,014
- The maintenance guy, why?
- Elevator nearly took his legs off.

583
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:15,382
- I knew it!
- No.

584
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:16,916
Uh, I'll go find an O.R. for him.

585
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,084
You come do this for me.

586
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,753
You want me to do an organ recovery?

587
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,888
You can perform an organ
recovery, can you not?

588
00:26:21,922 --> 00:26:22,956
Yeah, but you're already doing it.

589
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,090
I need to get to the E.R.

590
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,268
- I need...
- I need to do that.

591
00:26:25,302 --> 00:26:27,260
Look, I'll look after
the hospital, Dr. Karev.

592
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:29,095
Go scrub and get in here.

593
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,740
Okay, and we're good.

594
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:42,309
- Flow is good.
- Let's isolate.

595
00:26:42,343 --> 00:26:43,643
I've isolated the injury.

596
00:26:43,678 --> 00:26:45,111
I need a 4-0 prolene, please.

597
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:46,646
Uh, do you think
we should do a graft or...?

598
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:47,881
What can I do?

599
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:50,617
Uh... I think... I think we're good.

600
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:58,124
Uh...

601
00:27:01,962 --> 00:27:03,596
- How's she doing?
- Not good.

602
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:05,231
We've shocked her twice,
but we can't put her on bypass

603
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:07,334
until we have organs.
Bailey's already started.

604
00:27:07,368 --> 00:27:08,735
Scalpel.

605
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:16,910
There's extensive tissue damage,

606
00:27:16,944 --> 00:27:18,478
but the nerves here look salvageable.

607
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,347
Yeah, this left femur is looking gnarly.

608
00:27:20,381 --> 00:27:23,516
- But the right...
- The right looks like maybe an ex-fix.

609
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:25,418
- Where have you been?
- I, uh...

610
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:27,487
He was blown in the ambulance bay.

611
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,645
The wind threw him
into an ambulance. It was bad.

612
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,825
- You okay to work?
- Yes.

613
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,460
Yeah, we'll definitely take the left.

614
00:27:33,494 --> 00:27:34,694
Jury's out on the right.

615
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:36,262
What if we don't take either?

616
00:27:36,297 --> 00:27:38,031
Dude, this leg is a no-go.

617
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:39,666
It's crushed musculature,

618
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,534
open comminuted femur fracture,

619
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:43,036
a hashed neurovascular bundle.

620
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,522
- We should amputate...
- Dude, place some rods.

621
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,807
- What?
- Or a plate or an ex-fix.

622
00:27:47,842 --> 00:27:48,874
I mean, fix the legs.

623
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:50,176
Okay, yeah, the nerves are crushed,

624
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,045
but they're still intact, right?

625
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,680
I could do an arterial anastomosis.

626
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:54,681
I can get some blood flow in there.

627
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,216
He'll have a better outcome
with a prosthesis.

628
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,373
Please tell me you know that.

629
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:59,119
I know that he's here
because of a patient.

630
00:27:59,153 --> 00:28:00,387
I know that he did everything he could

631
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:01,721
so that she could survive.

632
00:28:01,756 --> 00:28:03,690
I want to save his leg. I can do that.

633
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,192
Well, maybe you can, but that
doesn't mean that you should.

634
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:07,894
Even if you save the blood supply,

635
00:28:07,928 --> 00:28:09,229
if he doesn't regain function...

636
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:10,830
Doctor, if you're not
gonna fix his femurs,

637
00:28:10,865 --> 00:28:13,066
then maybe your fellow
can give it a shot, huh?

638
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,352
All right.

639
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,412
It's metal shop. I want plates.

640
00:28:25,446 --> 00:28:27,313
- I want the modular rod tray open.
- Schmitt, give me some suction here.

641
00:28:27,348 --> 00:28:28,848
And some large Weber clamps,
a large lobster claw...

642
00:28:28,883 --> 00:28:30,917
I need curved micro scissors and,
uh, jeweler's forceps, please.

643
00:28:30,951 --> 00:28:32,051
Keep an eye on his MAPs,

644
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:34,087
and I want a strict urine output

645
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:37,857
and make sure that
there's a vigileo in his ICU.

646
00:28:40,027 --> 00:28:41,828
He's gonna want that license plate.

647
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:44,364
That's a keeper.

648
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:48,301
So, uh, you're...

649
00:28:50,237 --> 00:28:52,714
You want me to be involved?

650
00:28:53,908 --> 00:28:55,717
With the baby?

651
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,011
Yes.

652
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,060
Because I want to be involved.

653
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,105
Owen. I know.

654
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:12,492
I know you.

655
00:29:14,762 --> 00:29:16,162
I want that, too.

656
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:28,942
How's it gonna work, do you think?

657
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:32,612
It'll figure itself out.

658
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:33,713
We'll figure it out.

659
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:36,783
Yeah.

660
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:45,692
Hey.

661
00:29:49,697 --> 00:29:51,097
We're gonna have a baby.

662
00:29:53,601 --> 00:29:54,968
We are.

663
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,651
- We'll figure it out.
- Yeah.

664
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,128
Okay.

665
00:30:14,054 --> 00:30:15,622
Mm-hmm.

666
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:51,583
- 4-0 prolene.
- I'll follow.

667
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:19,945
- You good?
- All good here.

668
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,713
- Good here.
- Let's take her off bypass.

669
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:38,263
We got a heartbeat.

670
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:39,364
It's beating on its own.

671
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,300
Whew!

672
00:31:42,335 --> 00:31:44,069
- Thank God.
- She told me she would haunt me.

673
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:52,878
Okay, let's give her a kidney.

674
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:07,459
We keep the drugs in a big machine.

675
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:09,327
- You need a passcode to get to them.
- No, no, no.

676
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:11,830
- Some patient asked me to, uh...
- Is that why you came back?

677
00:32:12,277 --> 00:32:13,678
To steal drugs?

678
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,035
Please don't tell Amelia.

679
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,272
I'll just go, okay? Just let me leave.

680
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:23,909
Betty, if I did that,
I couldn't call myself a doctor.

681
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:26,845
Renal vein looks good.

682
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:28,446
Yeah. Good length on the ureter.

683
00:32:33,886 --> 00:32:35,921
- What is it?
- Her rhythm is deteriorating.

684
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:37,322
She's bradying down.

685
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:39,090
Push a mg of epi.

686
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,526
Helm, what is her lactic acid
and base deficit?

687
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,762
- Minus 12, and her lactate is 6.
- What is it?

688
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:44,863
It could be metabolite washout...

689
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:45,997
- it could be anything.
- Yeah.

690
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:47,198
Let's go back on bypass.

691
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:49,467
I'm gonna massage her heart.
Let's give her a kickstart.

692
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:51,136
Let's put her on an epicardial pacemaker.

693
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,375
Come on. Come on.

694
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:31,776
Come on.

695
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:36,581
You can have your job back.

696
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,583
I guess you already
took it back, but fine,

697
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,719
'cause I'm never gonna be
talked to like that again.

698
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:42,604
- Karev...
- No, I'm not gonna be told

699
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:44,356
to sit in a corner whenever
you feel like stepping in!

700
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,025
There was a crisis
I needed you to handle.

701
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:49,394
I couldn't get here
because of the crisis.

702
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:50,674
But I did anyway.

703
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:52,597
But it doesn't matter...
so screw it, screw you!

704
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,432
I never even wanted
this stupid job, anyway.

705
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:56,768
I was in crisis.

706
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:59,037
I needed you to do that surgery.

707
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:02,874
I was worried I might
nick one of the organs.

708
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:04,576
I needed to be somewhere

709
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,245
where I couldn't do any harm.

710
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:14,619
What?

711
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:17,497
Is it Warren? What is it?

712
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,428
What?

713
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,701
What?

714
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,770
Please don't quit.

715
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:33,805
Um...

716
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,307
I need time to...

717
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,270
get some things straightened out.

718
00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:43,281
I need your help.

719
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:47,318
Hey, whatever you want.

720
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:48,286
It's okay.

721
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,495
It's all right.

722
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:01,633
No pulse. Give me another epi.

723
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:02,620
Should we start bypass?

724
00:35:02,654 --> 00:35:04,469
No. Paddles.

725
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:06,071
Charge to 20.

726
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,512
Clear.

727
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:21,986
Come on, Cece.

728
00:35:22,021 --> 00:35:23,521
Please. Charge to 30.

729
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:24,923
Clear.

730
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:27,625
- Please.
- Again.

731
00:35:28,661 --> 00:35:29,894
Please.

732
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:45,223
I nearly kissed the Italian one.

733
00:35:47,026 --> 00:35:48,727
I may kiss the other one, too.

734
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:51,830
Because, I mean, look at him.

735
00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:56,768
I don't know if I'll ever
find love again.

736
00:35:56,803 --> 00:36:01,351
But I'm happier than
I've been in a long time.

737
00:36:05,378 --> 00:36:07,312
I'm having fun.

738
00:36:09,382 --> 00:36:12,150
And when I do, I hear your voice.

739
00:36:14,287 --> 00:36:16,254
Thank you, Cece.

740
00:36:48,054 --> 00:36:49,387
Hey. I just went to see Leo.

741
00:36:49,422 --> 00:36:50,522
How's Betty?

742
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:54,292
Um, apparently, she's been
with Webber all day, so...

743
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:56,072
Okay, well, good.

744
00:36:56,863 --> 00:36:59,297
- Amelia, I'm so sorry. I just...
- Please.

745
00:36:59,332 --> 00:37:01,333
I'm the one who said, "Go to Germany.

746
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:02,467
Go see Teddy."

747
00:37:02,502 --> 00:37:03,969
I should've said, "Take condoms."

748
00:37:06,205 --> 00:37:08,306
It's funny... I think back to that,

749
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:10,128
and, um, I really...

750
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:14,045
wanted it to work for you.

751
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,047
I wanted you to be happy with her.

752
00:37:16,082 --> 00:37:17,349
So maybe this...

753
00:37:17,383 --> 00:37:22,420
No. I am gonna be there
for the baby, okay?

754
00:37:22,455 --> 00:37:25,557
But anything between
Teddy and me isn't happening.

755
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:27,025
It's not an option.

756
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:29,060
That's not true, Owen.

757
00:37:30,763 --> 00:37:32,831
She's here.

758
00:37:37,303 --> 00:37:39,871
And she's pregnant with your baby.

759
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:44,876
She's an option.

760
00:37:48,381 --> 00:37:50,515
You are such a good man, Owen.

761
00:37:53,419 --> 00:37:57,756
And I am gonna give you time
to consider your options.

762
00:38:01,294 --> 00:38:02,427
Okay.

763
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:16,374
I gave this building everything.

764
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:18,043
Then it tried to eat me.

765
00:38:18,077 --> 00:38:20,278
Shut up.

766
00:38:20,313 --> 00:38:22,414
You were almost killed, you dummy.

767
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:25,217
- He's a hero.
- Ha!

768
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:27,485
So, what's going on, Doc?

769
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,321
Do I still have legs?

770
00:38:29,355 --> 00:38:30,488
Are they under all this stuff?

771
00:38:30,523 --> 00:38:31,556
They are.

772
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:34,492
In fact, Schmitt,
you want to do the honors here?

773
00:38:37,797 --> 00:38:40,232
Now, that signal there...
that means good blood flow.

774
00:38:40,266 --> 00:38:42,901
And there seems to be
a little nerve response,

775
00:38:42,935 --> 00:38:44,336
even this early.

776
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:47,339
It's tiny, but it's good enough
to give us hope.

777
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,181
But, sometimes, we can't find it.

778
00:39:01,454 --> 00:39:03,421
What happened today cannot happen.

779
00:39:03,456 --> 00:39:05,290
- I understand.
- I'm so sorry.

780
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:08,760
On-call rooms, storage closets,

781
00:39:08,794 --> 00:39:10,462
that weird, little radiology room on 4.

782
00:39:10,496 --> 00:39:12,631
Those rooms have locks.

783
00:39:12,665 --> 00:39:13,598
Understand?

784
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:14,633
- Yes, sir.
- Completely.

785
00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:17,602
God. Think.

786
00:39:22,308 --> 00:39:23,875
- Good advice.
- Oh, my God.

787
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,277
I think I just peed.

788
00:39:31,183 --> 00:39:33,218
Sometimes we're at
the mercy of the winds.

789
00:39:33,252 --> 00:39:35,487
We have nothing left but to accept it.

790
00:39:35,521 --> 00:39:37,222
I screwed up, okay?

791
00:39:37,256 --> 00:39:39,691
- I just screwed up.
- And I want to help you.

792
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:41,559
I'm trying to.

793
00:39:41,594 --> 00:39:46,325
But I need you to help yourself,
and you can't do that yet.

794
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,001
So I have called a rehab.

795
00:39:50,036 --> 00:39:51,036
I've gotten you a bed there,

796
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,873
and I can take you there now
if you will let me.

797
00:39:54,907 --> 00:39:56,308
If you'll try.

798
00:39:58,177 --> 00:40:00,178
Will you try?

799
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:02,414
When we face the storm,

800
00:40:02,448 --> 00:40:04,482
no matter how scary,

801
00:40:04,517 --> 00:40:07,638
no matter how much power
it has over us...

802
00:40:08,421 --> 00:40:10,388
Have you, uh...

803
00:40:10,423 --> 00:40:13,058
Have you talked to Mom at all?

804
00:40:13,092 --> 00:40:14,854
No, I haven't.

805
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:17,189
Why?

806
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,398
Um, can we find a place to talk?

807
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:24,402
...when we face it,
we find we are the shelter.

808
00:40:26,806 --> 00:40:28,073
We'll survive.

809
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:32,277
Yeah, I know it's quiet.

810
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:33,706
Really quiet.

811
00:40:34,447 --> 00:40:36,125
It's gonna be fine, buddy.

812
00:40:36,749 --> 00:40:38,616
We're gonna be great.

813
00:40:41,554 --> 00:40:43,088
Let's get you to bed.

814
00:40:46,158 --> 00:40:49,594
We find ourselves coming out
the other side...

815
00:40:49,628 --> 00:40:51,863
stronger for it.

816
00:40:56,769 --> 00:40:58,236
Hey.

817
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,637
Hey.

818
00:40:59,672 --> 00:41:01,233
You okay?

819
00:41:02,308 --> 00:41:03,641
Yeah.

820
00:41:03,676 --> 00:41:04,709
I just...

821
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:07,078
I really liked her... Cece.

822
00:41:07,113 --> 00:41:08,380
I know.

823
00:41:10,616 --> 00:41:13,451
- You, uh... You took the elevator.
- I did.

824
00:41:13,486 --> 00:41:15,220
So you don't learn
from your mistakes, then?

825
00:41:15,254 --> 00:41:18,089
DeLuca, when did you get so cocky?

826
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:21,159
When I realized that you like
this just as much as I do.

827
00:41:21,193 --> 00:41:23,161
I think the problem is we need
to get out of these clothes.

828
00:41:23,195 --> 00:41:24,429
Whoa.

829
00:41:24,463 --> 00:41:26,297
You just skipped a whole lot of steps.

830
00:41:26,332 --> 00:41:28,400
No, I mean the scrubs, the job.

831
00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:30,668
We need to go out together,
out of this hospital.

832
00:41:30,703 --> 00:41:32,837
- Tonight.
- There she is.

833
00:41:32,872 --> 00:41:34,506
Dr. Grey.

834
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,141
I wanted to see if you still wanted to...

835
00:41:39,612 --> 00:41:41,179
Sorry. could Dr. Grey
and I have a minute?

836
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:43,481
Actually, we're just right in
the middle of something, so...

837
00:41:45,217 --> 00:41:46,918
I'm sorry.

838
00:41:48,387 --> 00:41:49,621
I'm being haunted.

839
00:41:52,525 --> 00:41:54,426
It's been a long day,

840
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,796
and I'm going to go home
and see my children.

841
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:01,599
I will see you later.

842
00:42:03,035 --> 00:42:04,836
- You'll see...
- ...who later?

843
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,796
We might even find ourselves happy.

844

Truly, I have been through a lot,

00:00:07,336 --> 00:00:09,055
and I'm lucky to be alive,

00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:11,323
and I'm lucky to be okay, and I get that.

00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:14,860
So, yes, I'm just happy to be here.

00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:45,495
- I think so.
- What do you mean you think so?

21
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:47,592
I can't... look, she's all over the place.

22
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:49,394
I don't even know why
she let me back in the house.

23

We barely talk, which is probably good

24
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:52,597
because it's fewer chances
I'll piss her off again.

25
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:54,566
- That's pathetic.
- What's her problem?

- Still?

is if they work together,

so any cardio consults
that get paged to the pit,

This hospital is known
for making miracles happen,

and I'm looking for an epic-size miracle.

I felt a pain in my right tibia.

She's got a real mind for this stuff.

They did labs, P.E.T. scan, the works.

I know you did,
but this is what's happening.

everyone here against me.

I was assigned your case,

123
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,775
and if you would prefer a female therapist,

124
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:25,677
I would be totally comfortable with that.

125
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:27,846
Oh, because it was a man who attacked me?

126
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,948
Yeah. And it's important that you feel

127
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:31,950
that you're with the right person,

128
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:35,487
that you feel comfortable,
that you get what you need.

I appreciate that. I'm fine.

Yeah, just, you know,
ask me a few questions

133
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,697
and patch me up and send me on my way.

I should've gone somewhere else.

162
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:11,008
What the hell was that?

163
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:12,810
- Ambulance exploded.
- What?

164
00:06:12,844 --> 00:06:14,578
Partial thickness burns to the upper chest.

165
00:06:14,613 --> 00:06:16,413
Follow the light with your eyes.

166
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:17,715
[Breathing shakily]

167
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:18,883
Okay, good.

168
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:21,085
What happened?

169
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,386
Your rig exploded, but don't worry.

170
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,888
We've got you, okay? You're gonna be okay.

171
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:26,090
Oh, Shepherd, they need you in trauma 1.

172
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:26,991
Mm-hmm.

173
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:28,392
They figure out why that rig blew up?

174
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:29,693
Uh, fire department's looking at it now.

175
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:32,429
Oh, my god. It was me.

176
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:35,366
[Voice breaking]
I didn't secure the oxygen tank.

177
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,068
Johnny's always saying...

178
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:39,703
He's gonna kill me.

179
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:41,372
It was an accident, and he knows that.

180
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:43,874
He's gonna kill me.

181
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,242
[Breathing shakily]

182
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:47,544
Don't arch your neck. All right.

183

[Monitor beeping rapidly]

184
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:49,880
There's a lot venous blood
in the upper chest.

185
00:06:49,915 --> 00:06:51,548
The lac extends deep into the liver.

186
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,250
Let me get in there,
establish vascular control.

187
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:54,451
No, we're gonna pack him and take him up.

188
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:56,387
And then we'll be able to see
what the hell's going on.

189
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:58,088
He's open right now. Just let me work.

190
00:06:58,123 --> 00:06:59,023
He is hemorrhaging like crazy.

191
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:00,758
I'm not gonna let him bleed out down here.

192
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,359
Suction. More laps.

193
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:04,128
He's got a depressed
skull fracture. He needs a C.T.

194
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:06,463
Look, Owen, you know I can do
this. Let me stabilize him.

195
00:07:06,498 --> 00:07:08,299
Riggs, this is the plan.
Get on board, or get out.

196
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,433
Your plan is working great.

197
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:10,801
Better still, just get out.

198
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:11,969
Kepner, over here.

199
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:13,671
To hell with this!

200
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:18,876
When you first woke up after the attack,

201
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,111
what is the first thing you remember?

202
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:24,481
People.

203
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:26,150
People running around everywhere.

204
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:28,085
Who specifically?

[Monitor beeping rapidly]

206
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:33,863
It was pretty crazy.

207
00:07:34,926 --> 00:07:36,593
Oh. Thank you.

208
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:39,063
Uh, you, sir, have indigestion.

209
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:41,832
DeLuca here will get you an antacid.

[Cellphone chiming]

00:07:43,935 --> 00:07:46,103
So... sorry, sir. [Clears throat]

212
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:49,073
And, uh, also schedule
an upper endoscopy, please.

213

[Chiming continues]

214
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:53,944
- DeLuca, do you have somewhere to be?
- No.

215
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:55,346
Then put the damn phone away.

216

[Chiming continues]

Okay, he'll, uh, get you
the rest of your meds,

218
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:01,885
and you just, uh, sit tight, okay?

- Torres is on her way.
- Oh, okay. Thanks.

Hey, uh, listen, do you think

223
00:08:17,302 --> 00:08:19,636
tonight maybe you and I could just...
I don't know.

224
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:22,373
Oh, actually, I'm having
some people over tonight.

225
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:25,209
It's... it's nothing big,
just Steph, Blake, and Warren.

226
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:27,177
Okay, yeah. I mean, I get off late,

227
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:28,212
but I can pick up something
on the way home.

228
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:30,180
No, I meant, uh,

229
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:33,617
I'd kind of just like to spend
some time with my friends.

230
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:35,219
Oh.

231
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:37,454
Yeah, no.

232
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:38,856
I got something later anyway, so...

233
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,643
Oh, great, so you have someplace to be.

234
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:44,028
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got someplace to be.

- [Clears throat]
- Finally.

Mm-hmm.

00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:51,568

[Sighs] 15 going on 35.

240
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:55,406
Standard titanium plates, right?

Unless her parents will go for a
stem-cell scaffolding in the chest.

242

Well, it's, uh, just the mom

243
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:02,046
and, look, I-I don't want
to leave this girl

244
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,524
with an unprotected heart for years.

245
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,782
I need to make a recommendation.

246
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:06,383
Well, we could look into new technology.

No, I want the safest option.

248
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:10,120
- Then you go with plates.
- Tried and true.

249

[Cellphone clicking]

250
00:09:14,526 --> 00:09:16,360
So? Hit me.

251
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:20,264
Well, I, uh, consulted with
our ortho and cardio chiefs,

252
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:23,100
and, uh, the best solution
is a titanium-plate sternum

253
00:09:23,134 --> 00:09:24,101
and ribcage.

254
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:26,770
Okay. That's...

255
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:28,038
That sounds good.

256
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:29,540
How many revision surgeries?

257
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:33,343
Probably... Once a year
until you reach full growth.

258
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:36,780
And if I get hit with, say,
even a Nerf ball to the chest?

259
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:40,184
We'll... we'll just be
very careful, won't we?

260
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:41,685
Just answer my question.

261
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:43,454
It's very dangerous, yes.

262
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:45,089
So we're talking multiple surgeries?

263
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:47,191
You're just gonna open and reopen my chest?

264
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:48,625
Um, I'm sorry.

265
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,394
Can you explain what she mea...

266
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:53,730
A zipper scar.

267
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:54,731
Oh.

268
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:57,034
Oh, h-honey, I...

269
00:09:57,068 --> 00:09:58,035
We'll need to go in a few times,

270
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:00,471
but I assure you.
It's the safest, best option.

271
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:02,806
I figured out how to do it all
on a leg and a half,

272
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:04,708
and now you want to limit everything I do

273
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:05,742
for my entire childhood?

274
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:08,545
This is how you get.
The rest of your childhood.

275
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,280
I'm trying to save your life, Maya.

276
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:11,648
Sweetheart, we should consider this.

277
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:14,952
Maybe... I went to three different
hospitals before I came here,

278
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:15,986
and they all said the same thing.

279
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,889
They said, "go to Grey-Sloan.
Do to Dr. Karev."

280
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:22,126
So now I'm here, and this is
all I get... just this?

281
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,794
I'm disappointed in you.

282
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:26,430
Dr. Karev, you're off my case.

283
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:27,998
I'm sorry?

284
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:29,133
You're fired.

285
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:33,637
Meredith: A terrible thing happened.

286
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:36,073
I did get knocked around.

287
00:10:36,107 --> 00:10:37,574
But nobody died.

288
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:45,649
And any day where nobody dies,
that's a good day.

289
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:50,745
So, when you were laid up, healing,

290
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,997
- who visited you the most?
- Alex.

291
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:54,887
Remind me... Alex is...

292
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:57,320
Alex is the one who proposed
to his girlfriend.

293
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:59,108
Right. And she said no.

294
00:10:59,143 --> 00:11:00,443
Well, see, she didn't really say no,

295
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:02,445
and she didn't say yes,
and then she booted him,

296
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,647
and then he came back to live with me.

297
00:11:04,682 --> 00:11:07,116
Alex was there when you woke up.

298
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:10,820
I delivered him on a silver platter to her.

299
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:12,221
And he still managed to screw it up. Ugh.

300
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,890
You said he moved back in with her.

301
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:14,891
I mean to the place.

302
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,459
They're together, but they're not together,

303
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:17,694
but they could be together.

304
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:20,330
- It's... They're stupid.
- [Chuckles]

305
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:22,165
You have feelings for Alex?
Are you in love with Alex?

306
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:24,200
[Laughing] Do I have feelings for Alex?

307
00:11:24,234 --> 00:11:25,368
[Chuckles] That's funny.

308
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:26,369
[Laughs] No.

309
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:27,570
[Chuckles] I'm sorry.

310
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:31,374
I'm just trying to understand
why we're talking about them.

311
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:35,278
Because he's being stupid.

312
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,548
Uh, can she actually fire us? She's a kid.

313
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:39,549
Oh, shut up.

314
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,884
She's older than you are,
and she's smarter.

315
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,920
She'll cool off. She'll come around.

316
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,154
Go check my post-ops.

317
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:47,223
Well, I've never been fired before.

318
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:49,692
Does this go on my permanent record?!

319
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:50,994
God.

320
00:11:52,798 --> 00:11:55,333
You... you have to stop paging me, okay?

321

00:17:46,795 --> 00:17:48,863
I don't want to go home... Alone.

485
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:50,798
- [Sighs] I miss Penny.
- I miss having sex.

486
00:17:50,832 --> 00:17:53,033
Ugh. Penny and I had the greatest sex.

487
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:55,002
[Chuckling] It was that
"journey of discovery" great sex

488
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:55,903
you have in the beginning.

489
00:17:55,937 --> 00:17:57,872
Jo and I had sex like that all the time.

490
00:17:57,906 --> 00:17:59,607
And now no Penny, no sex.

491
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:01,047
No sex with Penny. None of it.

492
00:18:01,072 --> 00:18:04,211
Okay, let's not talk about sex,
because the chief is here.

493
00:18:04,246 --> 00:18:05,413
Bailey: I'm just eating my pizza.

494
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:07,982
Besides, it sounds like none
of y'all are getting any anyway.

495
00:18:08,016 --> 00:18:08,796
Pierce is getting some.

496
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,518
No, I'm not. Don't say that.
Forget he said that.

497
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:11,285
So annoying.

498
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:13,854
She has people over all the time,

499
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:16,056
like if I'm alone,
I'll explode or something.

500
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:17,358
They won't go away.

501
00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:18,826
Okay, but, guys, really, you can go.

502
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,327
No, we're here because it's fun.

503
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:23,197
- No, really, it's okay. I can...
- Are you sure? 'Cause you seem a little...

504
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:25,032
Cranky as hell? Which is
totally understandable

505
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:26,200
with everything you've gone through.

506
00:18:26,234 --> 00:18:28,068
- Of course you would be.
- Callie: And we're worried.

507
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:29,570
- You don't have to worry.
- We know.

508
00:18:29,604 --> 00:18:31,672
- And I'm not cranky.
- I know.

509
00:18:31,706 --> 00:18:34,141
- Except you are all the time.
- [Sighs]

510
00:18:34,176 --> 00:18:35,242
Therapist: Do you want to be alone?

511
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:37,511
Well, I'm a widow.

512
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:38,546
I'm good at it.

513
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,181
- I really just want...
- What?

514
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:41,182
Well, then, tell them to go away.

515
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:43,184
Well, no, because they're
just trying to help.

516
00:18:43,218 --> 00:18:44,985
- What do you want?
- What can we do?

517
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,587
Therapist: But they're not being helpful.

518
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:49,857
And it's all right
for you to tell them that.

519
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:52,860
Leave my house.

520
00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:53,994
Get out.

521
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:56,597
I mean, thank you, but,
really, just go be with whoever

522
00:18:56,631 --> 00:18:59,033
somewhere else so that I can go to sleep.

523
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,370
Leave.

524
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:07,241
You seem angry.

525
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:09,710
I'm not.

526
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:11,679
My bad.

527
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:13,614
I took your advice.

528
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:16,050
I kicked them all
out of my house last night.

529
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:18,118
And...

530
00:19:18,153 --> 00:19:19,920
It worked. They left me alone.

531
00:19:19,955 --> 00:19:21,222
Well, that's what you wanted.

532
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:23,791
I know.

533
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:31,065
[Doorbell rings] Hey. Dr. Webber.

534
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:32,617
Arizona's just gonna be a second, so...

535
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:34,119
Oh, thanks.

536
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:35,821
Hey, let's get a move on!

537
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:37,289
Trivia's starting in 15 minutes!

538
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:38,357
Arizona: Coming!

539
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:40,325
Yeah. [Chuckles]

540
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,027
Hey. Looking sharp.

541
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:42,794
Got a hot date?

542
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:44,529
Uh, yeah, something like that.

543
00:19:44,564 --> 00:19:45,497
Hmm.

544
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:47,933
She's, uh...
We're kind of keeping it quiet.

545
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:50,714
Oh. Secret romance?

546
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:53,438
I'm guessing she works at the hospital?

547
00:19:53,473 --> 00:19:56,208
I mean, she...

548
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:58,343
- [Chuckling] Relax, son.
- [Chuckling] Okay.

549
00:19:58,378 --> 00:19:59,978
I get it.

550
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:01,455
You know, it's been a few years,

551
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,615
but if yours is anything like mine was,

552
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:06,518
keeping it a secret makes it
just that much more exciting.

553
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:08,520
You know, you're totally right.

554
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:10,822
I mean, she... She keeps it so together

555
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:13,025
in front of people at work,
but then, when we're alone,

556
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:14,459
she's so... She's a wildcat, huh?

557
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:17,029
[Both laugh]

558
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:19,531
How... Do I look?

559
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:20,532
Do I look hot?

560
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:22,134
[Stammers] You're very hot.

561
00:20:22,168 --> 00:20:24,669
Can we go now? [Laughs]

562
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:27,039
Thank you. Whew!

563
00:20:27,073 --> 00:20:28,040
Okay. See you later.

564
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:30,175
You have fun, too.
Have fun tonight, DeLuca.

565
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:31,076
Thanks.

566
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,479
Oh, and, uh... You can't tame a wildcat.

567
00:20:34,514 --> 00:20:36,748
[Car alarm chirps]

568
00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:39,551
It's infuriating because
I know that our problems

569
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:41,253
haven't just magically disappeared.

570
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:42,854
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

571
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:44,954
Hey, uh, when are the rest
of the guys coming?

572
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,250
This is it.

573
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:49,728
All right. [Both laugh]

574
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:51,163
Penny: Why did you let him move in?

575
00:20:51,197 --> 00:20:53,765
Because he showed up on my door all sad

576
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,700
with his big, sweet face

577
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:58,170
and made me forget everything
that was wrong with us.

578
00:20:58,204 --> 00:20:59,037
I know.

579
00:20:59,072 --> 00:21:00,205
I see Callie walking down the hall,

580
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:04,109
she and I are barely talking,
and I still get stupid.

581
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:04,943
Ugh.

582
00:21:04,977 --> 00:21:06,511
I want to get stupid over somebody.

583
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:08,246
All I ever feel is smart.

584
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:11,383
I just want to take
his dumb, gorgeous face,

585
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:14,186
and I just... I want to...
I want to pummel it...

586
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,057
And kiss it and marry it
and just pummel it.

587
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:21,093
Penny: I get that, too. Mm.

588
00:21:21,127 --> 00:21:23,528
- Not the pummeling, but the kissing.
- Mm.

589
00:21:23,563 --> 00:21:25,564
I thought you didn't even
want to marry him?

590
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:28,266
I don't know what I want.
I can't be trusted.

591
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:30,569
I want to know what guys want.

592
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:32,037
Hey, Warren, Warren.

593
00:21:32,071 --> 00:21:33,238
You're a guy. What do you want?

594
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:38,110
Um... You know, that's, uh...
That's... that's tough. Um...

595
00:21:38,144 --> 00:21:40,745
Did anybody see that an ambulance
blew up in the E.R. today?

596
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,149
No, we're serious. What do guys want?

597
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:46,251
[Sighs] What do guys want?

598
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:49,221
[Clears throat] Out of this conversation.

599
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:50,155
- [Laughter]
- [Cellphone chiming]

600
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:52,724
Oh, um...

601
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:55,928
I just got an important
text, and I have to go.

602
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:58,099
You are impossible.

603
00:21:58,134 --> 00:22:00,832
- Oh, women are just as impossible.
- Really?

604
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:04,269
Look, I, uh... I can't speak for all men.

605
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:08,907
I'm just a guy who wants
to go home to his wife.

606
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:10,475
Sorry. Good night.

607
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,912
- [Chuckles]
- [Door opens, closes]

608
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:14,779
Screw Bailey.

609
00:22:14,814 --> 00:22:17,115
- [Both laugh]
- Aw.

610
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,316
She got the good one.

611
00:22:18,351 --> 00:22:21,319
- She did.
- Mm.

612
00:22:21,354 --> 00:22:23,788
[Gasps] Ho ho!

613
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:25,323
Looks like you owe me another beer.

614
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:27,259
- [Clicks tongue]
- Oh, hell.

615
00:22:27,293 --> 00:22:30,462
Hey, no one forced you to
take bets you couldn't win.

616
00:22:31,531 --> 00:22:33,231
What is the deal, Nathan?

617
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,801
No deal.

618
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:38,370
Go again?

619
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:41,039
I talked about Owen dozens of times

620
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:41,940
when we were over there,

621
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:42,807
and you never even mentioned knowing him.

622
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:45,810
Well, I didn't want to talk about it.

623
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:48,280
So, what, you guys have just,
like, always hated each other?

624
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:50,282
No, I never hated him.

625
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:54,386
We became Doctors together, went
through school, field training.

626
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,788
There was no one I trusted more.
We were like brothers.

627
00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:58,190
What happened?

628
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:01,359
You're up.

629
00:23:01,394 --> 00:23:03,228
Okay, so we're not talking about this?

630
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:04,863
We're playing darts.

631
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:11,249
How'd you get so good at darts anyway?

632
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:17,342
You pick up some things when
you have no reason to go home.

633
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:19,578
So, what are you gonna do?

634
00:23:19,612 --> 00:23:20,979
You gonna sign the papers?

635
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,182
We're playing darts.

636
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,322
Fine with me.

637
00:23:30,356 --> 00:23:32,257
Hey, you ready? I'm starving.

638
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,425
Listen, can we do this another night?

639
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:35,227
[Sighs]

640
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:36,127
Uh, okay.

641
00:23:36,162 --> 00:23:38,196
I'm not hungry, and I-I don't want to...

642
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:39,336
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing.

643
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,266

00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,405
There's damage to the retrohepatic IVC.

810
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,873
- The liver is just...
- Nathan: Yeah, I got it.

811
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:43,041
All right. You want to do
an end around the liver?

812
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:44,409
That is what I was thinking.

813
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:45,343
Okay, set up the biopump.

814
00:31:45,377 --> 00:31:47,178
- We're gonna need venous cannulas.
- On it.

815
00:31:47,212 --> 00:31:48,146
- You got the portal?
- Yep.

816
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,914
I got the SVC.

817
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:50,915
- Here.
- Cheers.

818
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,251
- Hunt called for him?
- Yeah, this could get ugly.

819
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:55,219
If you want, I can...

820
00:31:55,254 --> 00:31:57,355
- Clamps.
- Forceps.

821
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,426
Okay. I'm gonna need...

822
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,688
Metz.

823
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:09,400
Potts.

824
00:32:09,435 --> 00:32:10,501
Mm-hmm.

825
00:32:12,571 --> 00:32:15,540
- We're gonna need to do a...
- Purse string after bypass.

826
00:32:15,574 --> 00:32:17,208
Mm-hmm.

827
00:32:17,242 --> 00:32:19,243
I can help you guys if you need it.

828
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:21,546
- Okay, here, you can hold the cannulas.
- Okay.

829
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,504
And... Set here.

830
00:32:24,717 --> 00:32:26,071
Go.

831
00:32:27,553 --> 00:32:28,673
Lines up.

832
00:32:29,788 --> 00:32:30,989
- Clamping.
- Mm-hmm.

833
00:32:35,694 --> 00:32:37,328
Ooh. There you go.

834
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:38,896
- All right.
- Good.

835
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:40,498
Okay.

836
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:43,935
- Good.
- Set.

837
00:32:43,969 --> 00:32:45,203
And...

838
00:32:45,237 --> 00:32:46,504
Both: Three, two, one.

839
00:32:53,112 --> 00:32:54,345
Both: Flow.

840
00:32:56,615 --> 00:32:57,749
Not bad.

841
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:01,486
Both: 3/0 Prolene.

842
00:33:09,395 --> 00:33:13,398
Meredith, how did it feel for you?

843
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:16,467
You know, stuck there,
can't move, can't hear,

844
00:33:16,502 --> 00:33:20,038
can't speak, just watching everyone?

845
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,440
Crappy.

846
00:33:22,474 --> 00:33:24,336
You use that word a lot.

847
00:33:24,371 --> 00:33:25,520
Can you try a different one?

848
00:33:26,345 --> 00:33:29,541
I don't know. Open. Exposed. Alone.

849
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,249
Yeah, but you weren't alone.

850
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:33,457
They were all there.

851
00:33:49,868 --> 00:33:51,521
They all had you.

852
00:33:52,248 --> 00:33:53,648
So, I ask once again...

853
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:56,747
...how did it feel for you?

854
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:57,887
Yeah.

855
00:33:57,922 --> 00:34:00,278
Crappy really is the best word.

856
00:34:04,988 --> 00:34:06,288
Jo: Wow.

857
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:09,153
[Chuckles]

858
00:34:09,188 --> 00:34:10,521
Thank you.

859
00:34:10,556 --> 00:34:12,790
Okay.

860
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:14,459
[Sighs]

861
00:34:19,531 --> 00:34:21,532
Oh, shoot.

862
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:23,434
Ugh. Shoot. Damn it!

863
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,769
- What?
- What's going on?

864
00:34:24,803 --> 00:34:25,837
It's not fitting.

865
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:27,638
How is that possible?
It's custom-made for her.

866
00:34:27,673 --> 00:34:28,973
No, it's... The ribs are fine.

867
00:34:29,007 --> 00:34:30,374
It's like a fitted sheet on a bed.

868
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,477
Once you attach one side...
The other side pops out.

869
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:35,179
Yeah, and another set's
gonna take 14 hours to print.

870
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:36,881
- Can we leave her open for that long?
- N-no. No.

871
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:39,650
It will leave her at risk
for post-opt infection, clots.

872
00:34:39,685 --> 00:34:41,352
[Sighs] So, now what?

873
00:34:41,386 --> 00:34:43,087
Uh...

874
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,560
They want to retract her rib cage,

875
00:34:49,595 --> 00:34:51,835
pull it open to make enough
space for the new ribs to fit.

876
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:52,971
No.

877
00:34:53,034 --> 00:34:56,203
I mean, they could slip and
puncture her lung and her heart.

878
00:34:56,238 --> 00:34:58,205
We know. Or crack her ribs.

879
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,006
And if she's under too long,

880
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,007
they'll never get her off the vent.

881
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,209
Alex, either this
or we go back to the plates.

882
00:35:02,244 --> 00:35:04,311
Which is exactly what she doesn't want.

883
00:35:04,346 --> 00:35:07,014
That's why they wanted to check
before they went ahead.

884
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:10,518
I don't want to wake her up and ask her.

885
00:35:10,552 --> 00:35:12,353
She signed a consent.

886
00:35:12,387 --> 00:35:13,821
We don't need her permission.

887
00:35:13,855 --> 00:35:15,821
They wanted to check with you.

888
00:35:17,225 --> 00:35:19,160
My mom was just like her.

889
00:35:19,194 --> 00:35:21,128
I had to take care of everything.

890
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:24,131
Makes a girl glad she was left
in a stroller at a fire station.

891
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,320
[Laughs]

892
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:29,570
Made you tough.

893
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:31,005
Mm.

894
00:35:35,076 --> 00:35:36,537
Maya's tough.

895
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:38,330
She can do it.

896
00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:42,917
Okay. On my count. One, two, three.

897
00:35:42,951 --> 00:35:45,252
[Grunting]

898
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:46,587
Careful not to compress her heart.

899
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:47,621
I'm trying.

900
00:35:47,656 --> 00:35:49,256
Wilson, I know that you can
pull harder than that.

901
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:52,226
Okay. Again. One, two, three.

902
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,728
[Grunting] Okay. Come on.

903
00:35:54,763 --> 00:35:56,263
[Monitors beeping]

904
00:35:56,298 --> 00:35:58,399
Oh, crap. She's been under too long.

905
00:35:58,433 --> 00:35:59,433
She's fluid overloaded.

906
00:35:59,468 --> 00:36:00,835
Her heart's beginning to fail.

907
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:02,102
[Grunts]

908
00:36:02,137 --> 00:36:03,838
And done here.

909
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:06,607
Good? Kepner, would you finish up closing?

910
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:08,275
Uh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

911
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,011
Uh... That was...

912
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:13,214
Insane. Have you ever seen
anything like that?

913
00:36:13,248 --> 00:36:16,417
It's like they formed one super surgeon.

914
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:22,089
That was a thing of beauty.

915
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:24,091
It was like watching ballet.

916
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:27,495
Uh, Kepner, I think you owe me an apology.

917
00:36:30,499 --> 00:36:32,600
[Muffled] Just because we saved a patient

918
00:36:32,634 --> 00:36:34,235
doesn't mean things are back...

919
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:37,304
Do I, though?

920
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:39,306
You didn't screw this up
because I was there.

921
00:36:39,341 --> 00:36:41,108
If I wasn't there, that's when...

922
00:36:41,142 --> 00:36:42,243
Nathan: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop.

923
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:43,277
Yeah, okay.

924
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:46,213
[Indistinct shouting]

925
00:36:47,816 --> 00:36:51,385
All I know is when they're all
at my house, I want them gone.

926
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:54,588
And then, when they leave,
I don't feel any better.

927
00:36:54,623 --> 00:36:56,223
So, what, does that make me crazy?

928
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:57,929
I was gonna say it makes you human.

929
00:36:57,964 --> 00:36:58,893
[Both chuckle]

930
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:01,128
I am very good at being alone.

931
00:37:01,162 --> 00:37:03,464
I've taught myself how to do it.

932
00:37:03,498 --> 00:37:06,133
And I don't mean my kids. I love my kids.

933
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:08,980
And I have my class and my work.

934
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:11,305
I have moved on.

935
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:15,576
You see, but, uh,
a widow really hasn't moved on.

936
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,144
She's still sort of married.

937
00:37:17,178 --> 00:37:19,179
She's just married to a dead guy.

938
00:37:19,214 --> 00:37:21,148
You're not married anymore.

939
00:37:21,182 --> 00:37:23,188
And you're not a widow anymore.

940
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:25,386
So, what are you?

941
00:37:40,535 --> 00:37:42,281
I don't know.

942
00:37:54,457 --> 00:37:56,926
Okay, so, what happens now?

943
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,494
I don't know.

944
00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:00,829
That's up to you.

945
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:03,599
[Crying]

946
00:38:05,302 --> 00:38:06,569
She did great.

947
00:38:06,603 --> 00:38:09,171
They were able to do
exactly what she wanted.

948
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:10,784
You can go in.

949
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:14,677
She just looks so...

950
00:38:15,196 --> 00:38:16,585
[Crying]

951
00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:18,080
Well, why don't you go get some coffee

952
00:38:18,114 --> 00:38:21,183
and meet us back here
when you've had some time, okay?

953
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:23,252
[Sniffles]

954
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:25,521
Come on.

955
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,825
Surgical incision looks good.

956
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:31,994
I put her on a lasix drip,

957
00:38:32,028 --> 00:38:33,923
and I'll be back in an hour
to check her I's and O's.

958
00:38:33,957 --> 00:38:35,297
Thanks.

959
00:38:35,332 --> 00:38:37,666
Okay.

960
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,205
Your mom will be back soon.

961
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:46,003
Check this out, iron man.

962
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:50,679
You were a badass today.

963
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:56,907
We can keep going.

964
00:38:57,428 --> 00:38:58,470
Or...

965
00:38:59,356 --> 00:39:00,522
I feel good.

966
00:39:00,557 --> 00:39:01,952
<i>You</i> feel good?

967
00:39:02,392 --> 00:39:03,359
I don't.

968
00:39:03,393 --> 00:39:04,940
I mean, I feel comfortable

969
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,863
signing the papers for Dr. Bailey.

970
00:39:07,897 --> 00:39:10,633
You show no signs of PTSD.

971
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:12,801
And you're certainly capable

972
00:39:12,836 --> 00:39:14,033
of taking care of your patients...

973
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,267
And yourself.

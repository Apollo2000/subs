1
00:00:03,514 --> 00:00:06,849
<i>Infections have a nasty
way of sneaking up on you.</i>

2
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:16,225
<i>You're feeling pretty good,
you think the infection's gone,</i>

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,961
<i>and then it reappears...</i>

4
00:00:18,996 --> 00:00:21,197
<i>out of nowhere...</i>

5
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:23,065
<i>when your body's still weak,</i>

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,867
when you've barely recovered...

7
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:27,485
- Hey.
- Hey.

8
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:31,040
- What's all this?
- Sold it. I'm done with it.

9
00:00:31,396 --> 00:00:34,076
- With the trailer?
- Yep. Don't need it anymore.

10
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:35,498
Don't you need a place to sleep,

11
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:37,904
or are you moving into my
house, too, and no one told me?

12
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:40,416
(Chuckles) Better. I
just bought my own house.

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,199
Closing it this morning. Amelia's
been giving me a hard time

14
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,595
about getting a grown-up house, so...

15
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:47,590
So, no more trailer.

16
00:00:47,624 --> 00:00:49,776
<i>Bam. You're infected all over again.</i>

17
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:51,077
Yeah.

18
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:54,640
Wh... Sh... Is this...
Should I have asked you?

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,162
- I should've asked you.
- No, no.

20
00:00:56,172 --> 00:00:58,442
You paid for it. It's yours
to do what you want with.

21
00:00:58,452 --> 00:01:00,027
- You sure?
- Yes.

22
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:03,030
- Congratulations on the new house.
- Thanks.

23
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,498
(Engine starts)

24
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,408
And once the infection spreads,

25
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:08,469
<i>once it gets into your bloodstream,</i>

26
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:11,652
<i>well, then you really have to watch it.</i>

27
00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:16,026
<i>'Cause that's the kind of infection...</i>

28
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:19,895
<i>that can kill you.</i>

29
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:25,749
- (Clears throat, sighs)
- (Sighs)

30
00:01:30,613 --> 00:01:31,997
(Sighs)

31
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:34,094
Catherine's back in town next week.

32
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:36,363
Thought it'd be nice to
have some people over.

33
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,647
Well, nothing fancy... just dinner.

34
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,283
Who's in?

35
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:46,603
You know, that's a
fine idea, Dr. Webber.

36
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:48,408
- (Chuckles)
- Oh, sorry.

37
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:50,356
Yes, yes, yes. Thanks. Absolutely.

38
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:52,246
Mm-hmm, okay. Avery said yes.

39
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,947
- Uh, how about you?
- Yeah, I'll be there.

40
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:55,059
- Okay.
- I'm not sure

41
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:57,308
about Dr. Warren's schedule, though.

42
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,052
(Sighs)

43
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:02,789
Okay. Um, Warren?

44
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:04,329
- Uh, yeah, I'm in.
- All right.

45
00:02:04,339 --> 00:02:06,009
Uh, what can I bring?

46
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:08,385
Um, I wouldn't say no
to that artichoke dip

47
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,807
- you brought to the resident mixer.
- (Chuckles)

48
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:13,664
Well, that's, uh... that's
Miranda's secret recipe.

49
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:15,495
(Clears throat)

50
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:17,433
Okay.

51
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:21,108
I see. (Clears throat)

52
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:24,346
- I'll bring it.
- (Elevator dings)

53
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,517
Should be a great party.

54
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:37,224
Hey, Maggie, did you hear
that Owen bought a house?

55
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,927
Oh, good, now you can
naked snuggle on his sofa.

56
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,396
Wait. Furniture. Right. I
need some of that. Suction.

57
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,948
No black recliners, I beg you.

58
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,615
And nothing you have
to assemble yourself.

59
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,636
You got a real house, get some real
furniture, keep the momentum going.

60
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:51,471
Hey, maybe you should
come shopping with me,

61
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:52,620
point me in the right direction.

62
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,008
Then you'll just wind up with a
house full of furniture I like.

63
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:59,079
I don't see that as a problem.
I want stuff we both can enjoy.

64
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,847
Wait. What? Why? Is she...

65
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:03,350
Are you moving in with him?

66
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,661
- Duval forceps, please.
- Oh, no.

67
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:07,272
I mean, that's not... I don't think...

68
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:10,217
Why not? Just think
about it. It's pretty big.

69
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,288
Nice yard. Good school district.

70
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:18,272
(Chuckles) I'm sorry. Did you just
go from moving in to having kids?

71
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:19,812
Boy, you guys move fast.

72
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:21,594
I couldn't even sleep in
the same bed as my fiancÃ©.

73
00:03:21,604 --> 00:03:24,623
- We were engaged for a year.
- Long engagements... bad idea.

74
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:28,449
I agree. Better to go straight to
the, uh, marriage part. It's better.

75
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,991
Would you get married again?

76
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,062
I'd consider it, with the right person.

77
00:03:32,072 --> 00:03:34,872
- You would?
- I'd strongly consider it, yes.

78
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,884
Me too.

79
00:03:38,294 --> 00:03:40,748
- With the right person.
- Okay, then.

80
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:46,573
Wait. What? Did you j... What
just happened? Are you engaged now?

81
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,921
- What? No.
- No.

82
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:49,965
- Hypotheticals.
- We were just... That was nothing.

83
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:52,912
We were just talking. We were just...

84
00:03:56,297 --> 00:03:58,446
Maggie, we were just talking.

85
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:01,134
Oh, please. How long you
think till you move out?

86
00:04:01,144 --> 00:04:04,004
- Who's moving out?
- Amelia, when she marries Owen Hunt

87
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,673
and moves into his big,
new, kid-friendly house.

88
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:10,409
No, no. Okay, hang on. It was a
hypothetical conversation. That is it.

89
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,975
In which you were picking
out hypothetical furniture

90
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:15,666
for your hypothetical
children's hypothetical playroom.

91
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:17,117
- Wow.
- It... it was nothing.

92
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:18,712
- Can we drop it, please?
- Why?

93
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:19,887
Gladly.

94
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:24,518
- Gladly? Why gladly? What's wrong?
- Do you see a dilation?

95
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:27,178
I'm worried about
medullary sponge kidney.

96
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:30,017
- You didn't answer my question.
- You didn't answer mine.

97
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:32,475
You think we're moving
too fast? Is that it?

98
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:33,949
Amelia, please.

99
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,969
You're the one who
pushed us back together.

100
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:38,872
You know, you practically yelled at me

101
00:04:38,907 --> 00:04:41,341
to run back into his arms, and now...

102
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:42,943
Thanks for the consult.

103
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,792
I called the landlord,

104
00:04:55,802 --> 00:04:58,267
and he agreed to swap
out our two-bedroom lease

105
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:00,327
for something smaller, since...

106
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:04,427
I mean, I figured that I could
save on rent while I'm at Preminger,

107
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,569
so I can afford to fly
back on weekends to Seattle

108
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:10,704
to, you know, visit you and Sofia.

109
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:12,931
- Okay.
- Okay?

110
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:14,415
Yeah, sounds good.

111
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:21,648
I don't want to leave
when we're like this.

112
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:23,150
We've barely talked since the trial.

113
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:27,054
- I really don't know what to say.
- Neither do I, but I am trying to...

114
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:29,590
say words and to be here and help.

115
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:31,658
You've helped enough.

116
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:35,395
Okay.

117
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:40,713
Okay.

118
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:48,824
(Sighs)

119
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:51,339
X-rays came back clear. No breaks.

120
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:54,602
We got lucky, Nash. So listen
to your grandma the next time

121
00:05:54,612 --> 00:05:57,828
she tells you not to climb
the bookshelves, okay?

122
00:05:58,038 --> 00:05:59,513
All right.

123
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:07,661
Thank you, Doctor. You have
been so good with him today,

124
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,349
so patient, and I can't help but notice

125
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:12,666
- I don't see a ring on your finger.
- (Chuckling) Excuse me?

126
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,106
You should meet my daughter...
Nash's mom. Not the sharpest tack,

127
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:18,564
but really sweet, really pretty.

128
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:21,423
Ma'am, I appreciate the offer,
but I'm with someone already.

129
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:23,313
- Oh, are you engaged?
- Uh, no...

130
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:25,070
- Are you getting engaged?
- Uh, well, I...

131
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,555
Her number's in that chart. I'll
tell her to expect your call.

132
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:31,258
Okay.

133
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:35,456
(Siren wails in distance)

134
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:37,937
- Hey.
- I think Grandma over there

135
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:39,967
just arranged my
marriage to her daughter.

136
00:06:39,977 --> 00:06:41,389
(Laughs)

137
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:44,619
Well, there must be something in
the air, because Amelia and Owen

138
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:46,569
are talking about getting married, too.

139
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,302
Hey, maybe you guys could
have a double wedding.

140
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:50,161
Then I would only have
to live through it once.

141
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:52,175
Help! Please! Someone help!
It's okay, buddy. I got you.

142
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:53,441
Whoa. Okay, what happened?

143
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:55,334
He passed out, he came to,
and then he passed out again.

144
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:57,078
- Okay, let's get him down here.
- Is another kid outside.

145
00:06:57,112 --> 00:07:00,812
- Is this your son, sir?
- Uh, no. I'm his driver's ed teacher.

146
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:03,348
Hey, I got it.

147
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:05,522
Hey, there. You okay?

148
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:07,953
Can I... can I park here?

149
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:17,303
Quit hovering and just go
in there and talk to him.

150
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:21,942
He has made it very clear he doesn't
want me anywhere near him. So, no.

151
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,538
Does she have him on
fluconazole in case it's fungal?

152
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:26,784
You do realize that Kyle can see you?

153
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:29,007
It's not one-way glass.

154
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:32,781
Thank you.

155
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:39,987
(Clatter)

156
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:45,192
- Kyle? Oh, God.
- I'm fine.

157
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:47,528
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

158
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:49,664
I'm fine.

159
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:51,666
Everything just...

160
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,303
started spinning.

161
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:57,201
The... the nausea's probably
because of the antibiotics.

162
00:07:57,401 --> 00:08:01,401
Uh, I'll get Dr. Shepherd
to get you an antiemetic.

163
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:04,412
(Vomits)

164
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,316
(Coughs)

165
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:10,998
Why don't you just go?

166
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:13,053
Take that.

167
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,784
(Vomits)

168
00:08:21,738 --> 00:08:23,030
(Panting)

169
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,923
I don't need any help.

170
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,858
And I definitely don't
want an audience for this.

171
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:33,708
Then, um, let's pretend
that you're puking

172
00:08:33,718 --> 00:08:35,215
for some other reason, then.

173
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:37,945
Like, um, after a show or something.

174
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,930
Too many whiskey shots,
you know? Fun puking.

175
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,418
You're not hearing me. I
don't need any help from you.

176
00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:47,409
Look, I understand if you
don't want to deal with me,

177
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:49,947
but you are gonna need
somebody. Does your friends,

178
00:08:49,957 --> 00:08:51,547
do your family know that you're here?

179
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:54,368
(Scoffs) That's none of
your business, all right?

180
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:58,199
- I'm not your business anymore.
- Okay.

181
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,301
But you're gonna need someone.

182
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:04,705
Dr. Shepherd took out your implant.
Your tremor is gonna come back.

183
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,247
No kidding.

184
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:12,913
Kyle, I'm sorry.

185
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:16,717
(Voice breaking) I'm
gonna puke again... now.

186
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:22,031
How about you just go?

187
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:25,656
Go. Go!

188
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,732
I'm g... I'm going.

00:09:44,536 --> 00:09:46,822
Dad, Dad, I may have brushed
against the wall, but...

191
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:50,444
Good news, Arvin. I see no signs
of anything. You're doing just fine.

192
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:54,205
And the doctor says I'm
fine. Yeah. The doctor.

193
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,593
Well, it... it was the wall of
a hospital, but didn't I say that?

194
00:09:57,603 --> 00:09:59,429
Tell him that Rhys had
a medical emergency.

195
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:00,815
It's strep throat.
That's not an emergency.

196
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:03,752
Strep throat shouldn't cause you
to faint. Are you on antibiotics?

197
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:05,937
Yeah, for two days. I'm fine.

198
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:07,781
But, still, open up.

199
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,435
You passed out in a car.

200
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:10,864
You know how dangerous
that is on the road?

201
00:10:10,874 --> 00:10:12,274
I wasn't even driving! It was Arvin!

202
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:13,704
- Has he passed out before?
- I don't know.

203
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,634
His mother would kill me if
I let something happen to him.

204
00:10:15,644 --> 00:10:16,890
Aw, please don't talk about her.

205
00:10:16,924 --> 00:10:18,689
It looks like Rhys has
a peritonsillar abscess.

206
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:20,243
I do need to drain it.

207
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:22,752
Oh, no, no, you're not sticking
that thing down my throat.

208
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:24,930
Hey, hey, Rhys, buddy, it's
okay. I'm here. All right?

209
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,723
It's like I told you, I want
you to think of me as a father.

210
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:29,903
Why? All my mom ever talks about is
when she's gonna break up with you.

211
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:31,188
- What?
- Hold on. Hold on.

212
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,707
Your mom's doing our
driver's ed teacher?

213
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:35,809
(Siren wails in distance)

214
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,578
I came as soon as I got the
message. Rhys, honey, are you okay?

215
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:40,432
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- No, he's not okay, and neither am I.

216
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:42,710
You told him that you want to
break up with me? Is that true?

217
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,357
- You told him?
- Uh, n... Ahh, ahh?

218
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:48,132
This is way better than
our last driver's ed class.

219
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:50,500
Ready? Here we go.

220
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,995
Oh.

221
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,425
(Elevator dings)

222
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:59,165
- Be nice.
- I know.

223
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,086
But, God, she put me through hell.

224
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:04,270
I know, and you won. You
can afford to be magnanimous.

225
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:07,841
Hey, guys. Well, I, uh,
was wondering if, um...

226
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,976
I've had a surgery
come up later this week,

227
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:12,078
and so I wanted to ask
if I could please have

228
00:11:12,113 --> 00:11:15,081
Sofia Tuesday night instead of Thursday.

229
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:19,897
Um, so if I allow you
to have Sofia on Tuesday,

230
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:23,150
then in exchange, I
will have her Friday?

231
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:24,980
Yeah, sure, if that's what you want.

232
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,693
Great. Okay, then I will make that work.

233
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,261
Thank you.

234
00:11:29,837 --> 00:11:30,997
- She's gone.
- Hmm?

235
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:34,134
I'd lose that crazed smile
before you start cramping.

236
00:11:34,588 --> 00:11:36,427
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

237
00:11:37,138 --> 00:11:39,706
I am concerned about Kyle.

238
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,969
You know, he's still septic. His
cultures are showing possible fungus.

239
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:44,540
He's also complaining of neck stiffness.

240
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,462
Why are you talking to me about this?

241
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,652
You operated three days ago.

242
00:11:47,662 --> 00:11:49,212
- Why isn't he recovering?
- No. You are off this case.

243
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:50,779
You are not on my service today.

244
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:52,967
Why are you talking to me about this?

245
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,654
Are you sure the infection

246
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:57,257
isn't because of the
second lead you placed...

247
00:11:57,267 --> 00:11:58,767
The one you had to convince us to get?

248
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:01,316
Him... the one I convinced him to get

249
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:03,797
because he is my patient, not you.

250
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:06,566
- I am just concerned.
- And if you were the patient's family,

251
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,468
I would want to assuage those concerns,

252
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:10,804
but you are neither family
nor friend right now.

253
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:15,022
- He developed a complication.
- Complications happen, Edwards.

254
00:12:15,177 --> 00:12:18,277
We deal with them every
day. Today is no different.

255
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,626
White count is trending
down, wound is clean,

256
00:12:22,636 --> 00:12:24,417
but his temp is still a little high.

257
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,587
- Hey, Kyle, how you feeling?
- I was good until these two showed up.

258
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,090
It's been nag city
for the last half-hour.

259
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,092
Well, maybe you should think
about that the next time

260
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,859
you're in the hospital for
three days without calling us.

261
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:37,230
I went through 19 hours of
labor with you, without drugs.

262
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:39,265
You owe me at least a text or a "tweep."

263
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,129
Mom, it's a tweet, for the 10th time.

264
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:44,123
- Are you Dr. Shepherd?
- I am, yeah.

265
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,506
Dr. Shepherd recently
removed the infected device

266
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,241
from Kyle's brain,
but you should be aware

267
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:50,243
that both the surgery
and the antibiotics

268
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:51,571
aren't working as well as we expected.

269
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:53,613
- I'm sorry. Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Edwards.

270
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,525
I'm one of the surgeons here.

271
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:56,973
This is her?

272
00:12:57,273 --> 00:12:59,448
- This is her.
- You can go.

273
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,461
Kyle, if we could just talk...

274
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:01,955
- Why is she even here?
- I want her to go.

275
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,617
- Mm-hmm.
- My son is not good enough for her.

276
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:04,828
She's not good enough for us.

277
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:08,044
My brother's broken a lot of hearts,
but I've never seen anyone break his.

278
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,055
And I got to think he'd be
better off if he'd come in here

279
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,876
sooner instead of trying to avoid you.

280
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:15,315
So, please, do my family a favor
and get the hell out of here.

281
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:17,988
Thank you, Dr. Edwards.
That will be all.

282
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:26,946
So, it's a basic
decortication procedure,

283
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:28,815
except there is a slight abnormality.

284
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,039
Yeah, sorry, I can't take
your decortication procedure

285
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:33,753
'cause I already took
it. Just did the consult.

286
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:35,421
You just took my patient
without telling me?

287
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:37,770
You've been pawning decortications
off on me since I got here.

288
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,292
You hate them, so now I just take
them, and you don't have to pawn.

289
00:13:41,302 --> 00:13:42,705
Thank you.

290
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:45,398
- Bacon?
- Is that a box of bacon?

291
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:48,168
- Bacon. Mm-hmm.
- A cardiothoracic hand grenade.

292
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:50,330
- You know you're a doctor, right?
- Mm.

293
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,188
- A heart doctor.
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,768
It is good.

295
00:13:57,778 --> 00:13:59,344
- Told you.
- Mm-hmm.

296
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,209
It's my job, isn't it?

297
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,186
You got the big, fancy job, and
you have no respect for mine.

298
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:07,843
Are you trying to tell me
that your life's ambitions

299
00:14:07,853 --> 00:14:10,156
stopped after driver's ed teacher?

300
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,385
Do you know how many hours the average
American spends behind the wheel...

301
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:13,874
- Oh, here we go.
- Many accidents there are every day?

302
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:15,628
I am shaping the drivers of the future.

303
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:17,263
I'm saving lives! I'm a freaking hero!

304
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:20,015
Okay, Superman. We get it,
okay? Hands at 10 and 2.

305
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,969
Yeah, except the recommended
placement is 9 and 3 now.

306
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:24,003
- 9 and 3!
- See these two?

307
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:26,398
You and Wilson are doing it
right, not rushing into things.

308
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,775
Rushing into things? We've
been together a million years.

309
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,176
Dr. Karev? Dr. Grey?

310
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:31,706
Had to put the screws to the X-ray tech,

311
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:33,379
but I got him to rush Rhys' films.

312
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,412
- Is that air around the trachea?
- I hope not.

313
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:37,884
It could be artifact, but we need a CT.

314
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,316
You're really great.
You're... you're clean, but...

315
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:41,935
Who's interrupting the
happy couple to let Mom know?

316
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:43,389
I don't know. I was
thinking right about now.

317
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,650
- Yeah, well, maybe I am, too.
- Oh, great.

318
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,293
So now you're gonna break up
with me? This is fantastic.

319
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:49,495
(Indistinct arguing)

320
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:51,068
Have fun.

321
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,234
(Exhales sharply)

322
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,991
(Elevator dings)

323
00:14:56,001 --> 00:15:00,607
Jo, look, I need to know what is
going on with Kyle. Just tell me.

324
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:02,709
Shepherd would kill me.
His family would kill me.

325
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,186
Jo, please. Come on.

326
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:06,717
You have, what, four floors
to tell me everything you know.

327
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:07,847
Please. What is going on?

328
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:12,024
Okay, his symptoms
aren't getting any better.

329
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,484
He's febrile with some
headaches, a bit lethargic,

330
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:17,914
and Shepherd ordered a
stat CT that showed evidence

331
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:20,574
of an abscess in the
periventricular area.

332
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:26,222
Okay. Uh, s... so what
is Shepherd's plan?

333
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:28,434
Drainage and ventricular washout.

334
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,504
No. Wh... No. What?

335
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,018
She wouldn't do that. She knows
how dangerous that can be. She...

336
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:38,445
- She can't.
- (Elevator dings)

337
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,710
I'm sorry. I have a ton
of prep before surgery.

338
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,522
Does... does he know
how dangerous it can be?

339
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:49,590
Big wedding or small wedding?

340
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:51,920
(Chuckles) Well, not too small.

341
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,161
You want it to be a party.

342
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:56,806
(Inhales sharply) So, um, kids?

343
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,809
- Five.
- Whoa. Five?

344
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:00,186
Sure.

345
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,389
Unless the first few terrorize
us. Then we can have four.

346
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:05,067
(Chuckles)

347
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,694
Are we really talking about this?

348
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:10,930
Marriage and kids?

349
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:12,798
No.

350
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,703
I mean, maybe one day, but no.

351
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:19,288
(Chuckles)

352
00:16:19,298 --> 00:16:21,990
It was pretty fun watching
Maggie's face in the O.R., though.

353
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,957
(Both chuckle)

354
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:26,812
You know, it is fun
being fake married to you.

355
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,682
Well, it's fun being
fake married to you.

356
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,365
(Pager vibrates, beeps)

357
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,954
Mm. Mm-hmm.

358
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:37,423
I have... I have to prep for a surgery.

359
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:39,327
Bye-bye.

360
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:43,563
âª (Echoing) And all I got to âª

361
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:48,768
Uh, Knox asked me to cover for him
on that facial implant tomorrow.

362
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:51,103
- Cool with you?
- Yeah, of course.

363
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:54,574
Hey, look, um, if you
need a place to crash,

364
00:16:54,608 --> 00:16:56,809
I still owe you and I still have a sofa.

365
00:16:56,843 --> 00:16:58,558
Why would I need your sofa?

366
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:00,980
Everything okay between you and Bailey?

367
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:02,120
Yeah. Fine.

368
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,749
No, you're still living
in the same house,

369
00:17:03,784 --> 00:17:05,117
but you're not talking
to each other, right?

370
00:17:05,152 --> 00:17:07,282
- I'm aware.
- Counseling?

371
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,345
(Chuckles)

372
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:10,897
Well, if we go to counseling,
then we'll have to talk,

373
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:13,291
and then we'll yell, so
not talking is better.

374
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:14,711
So, what are you gonna do?

375
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:16,195
- Do?
- Well, yeah.

376
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,798
- You can't just stay like this.
- Oh, I can stay like this.

377
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:22,001
And I will. I am a very patient man.

378
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:23,769
And I am right, which makes me

379
00:17:23,804 --> 00:17:26,780
even more patient since
she is overreacting.

380
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,049
I know it and she knows it, though
she's not ready to admit it yet.

381
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:32,217
So I am biding my time
until she apologizes,

382
00:17:32,227 --> 00:17:33,774
at which point I will haul my ass

383
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:36,549
back into our bedroom where it belongs.

384
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,651
So... so you're not mad?

385
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:42,655
Nah, man, I am pissed as hell, but
she's the love of my life, so...

386
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:44,290
I mean, you get it. You got April.

387
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:46,225
April and I are divorced.

388
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,194
Well, like I said... waiting game.

389
00:17:48,228 --> 00:17:49,895
Stay strong. You'll get there.

390
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,303
You're out of your damn mind.

391
00:17:51,313 --> 00:17:52,832
Yeah, I know.

392
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:55,534
âª

393
00:17:56,388 --> 00:17:59,872
Oh, hey, Bailey, I need to
talk to you about Warren.

394
00:17:59,882 --> 00:18:01,707
Oh, if this is about that dinner...

395
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:04,343
No, it... it isn't. You
know, I'm just, um, concerned.

396
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:06,345
It's been a couple months now.

397
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,014
âª Walk into the sun âª

398
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:11,083
We'll be fine. Look,
it's a waiting game.

399
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:14,302
I'm right, and once he remembers
that's always the case, we'll be fine.

400
00:18:14,312 --> 00:18:17,538
Well, good. And then maybe you
would consider reinstating him...

401
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:19,322
sooner than later, okay?

402
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,902
So when you said you were concerned,

403
00:18:20,912 --> 00:18:23,488
you meant you were concerned about you.

404
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:26,173
- Of course not.
- Um, sir, after the many years

405
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:28,040
I served under you as my chief,

406
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,871
you must understand how
difficult it is for me

407
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:33,716
when you force me to say, respectfully,

408
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,551
this is not my problem

409
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:38,087
and, please, go do your damn job.

410
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,391
I don't think you found
that difficult at all.

411
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:45,394
âª And all I got to do

412
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:48,898
âª Is walk in, is walk into the sun âª

413
00:18:48,932 --> 00:18:50,833
I'll probably end up
hosting this wedding.

414
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:52,435
I hosted Owen's last wedding. Why not?

415
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:54,045
What's it matter? Why
do you care so much?

416
00:18:54,055 --> 00:18:56,002
I just wanted Amelia to
keep busy with something.

417
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:57,506
You know, like a hobby.

418
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,209
'Cause if she's talking Owen's
ear off, she can't talk off mine.

419
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:02,621
- How does this change that?
- This means more talking.

420
00:19:02,631 --> 00:19:04,814
Only now it'll be about
flowers and caterers

421
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:07,416
and what kind of dress I'm
gonna wear. Kill me now.

422
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:09,179
- Promise me you won't do this.
- What?

423
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,509
If Jo ever pulls that
ring out of that drawer,

424
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,623
just go to Vegas. Elope or something.
Don't put us through it all.

425
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:16,734
- (Monitors beeping)
- Oh, no.

426
00:19:16,744 --> 00:19:19,753
(Sighs) Air pockets in
the parapharyngeal space.

427
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:21,764
Necrotizing fasciitis.

428
00:19:21,774 --> 00:19:24,633
God, it's everywhere...
mediastinum, the heart.

429
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:26,635
There's no time. If
it spreads any further,

430
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,270
there won't be anything left to salvage.

431
00:19:28,305 --> 00:19:30,072
I'm gonna take him up
to the O.R. right now.

432
00:19:30,107 --> 00:19:33,807
I'll page Jackson and cardio and
tell them to meet us up there.

433
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:36,939
Both: They paged cardio.

434
00:19:36,949 --> 00:19:39,281
- You want it?
- I don't even know what it is.

435
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:41,988
It's a kid with strep throat
turned into nec fasc in the chest.

436
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:43,552
- Pretty cool.
- Not for the kid.

437
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:46,687
No, for the kid, it sucks.
Does sound cool, though.

438
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:48,258
Flip you for it.

439
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:51,368
<i>Is one of you gonna
get in here, or what?</i>

440
00:19:52,095 --> 00:19:54,296
(Sighs) Uh, you know
what? You can have it.

441
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:56,599
I mean, you have seniority.

442
00:19:57,177 --> 00:19:59,668
Yes. So I don't have to go
in there if I don't want.

443
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:01,259
Thought you wanted it.

444
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:06,642
- This is an abuse of power.
- This is a delegation of resources.

445
00:20:06,676 --> 00:20:09,735
- You're a very valuable resource.
- Oh, don't you flatter me now.

446
00:20:09,745 --> 00:20:11,476
I have faith in you.

447
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:16,082
Where Mer's concerned, just, you
know, give as good as you get.

448
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:17,657
I gave you bacon!

449
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,825
You're taking Kyle in
for a ventricular washout?

450
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:26,981
Hello, resident who is
not on my service today.

451
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:29,632
There is an 85% mortality rate.

452
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,934
If his abscess ruptures
while he's on the table,

453
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:34,670
- he dies immediately.
- Edwards, you are really underfoot.

454
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:37,339
Look, he just deserves
all the time he can get,

455
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:40,713
not some... Hail Mary.

456
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:43,313
I mean, can you answer
me, please, Dr. Shepherd?

457
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:45,614
- Do you have this?
- Okay, no, I am not answering that.

458
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:48,384
Not simply because the
patient and the family

459
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:51,028
have expressly asked you
not be involved in this case,

460
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:52,555
which would be enough,

461
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:54,957
but more because I do not answer to you.

462
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:57,126
This is my surgical plan.

463
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,749
I am confident in my surgical plan.

464
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,225
End of discussion.

465
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:03,942
Wilson, what?

466
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:07,609
I just wanted to let you know the
O.R. will be ready in 45 minutes.

467
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:08,920
Thank you.

468
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:12,541
For an average surgeon,

469
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:15,644
sure, a ventricular washout
could be a Hail Mary,

470
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,114
but, Edwards, this is me.

471
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,052
âª You can taste the dishonesty âª

472
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:25,977
âª It's all over your breath âª

473
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:29,391
âª As you pass it off so cavalier âª

474
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:31,660
âª But even that's a test âª

475
00:21:31,695 --> 00:21:35,449
âª Constantly aware of it all âª

476
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:37,900
âª My lonely ear âª

477
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:43,172
Either come in or stay out, but
don't do whatever it is you're doing.

478
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:44,636
Okay.

479
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:47,628
(Sighs)

480
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:50,461
I was thinking. Uh, maybe...

481
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:52,748
I can postpone leaving...

482
00:21:53,203 --> 00:21:55,718
for just a little while,
just until things are better,

483
00:21:55,752 --> 00:21:58,053
until you and I are... are better.

484
00:21:58,088 --> 00:22:00,222
What's the point? (Scoffs)

485
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:02,820
What? Two days? A week?

486
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,561
- We both know how this ends.
- No, I don't.

487
00:22:06,106 --> 00:22:07,316
(Sighs)

488
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,799
But apparently you do, so...
why don't you enlighten me?

489
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:12,601
All right, look, we'll
drag this out. Sure.

490
00:22:12,636 --> 00:22:14,950
You can wait here and things
will get superficially better,

491
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,251
and then you'll leave,

492
00:22:16,261 --> 00:22:19,746
and then we'll let things taper
off the way things taper off

493
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,711
over long distance,
and then we'll be sorry,

494
00:22:22,746 --> 00:22:24,713
and we'll make promises
that are just lies.

495
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:26,949
It's all a lie, because I'm
not leaving without Sofia,

496
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:29,385
and you would never forgive
me if you gave up your grant,

497
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:33,088
so I'm stuck here, Penny. I am
stuck, and there's no good solution.

498
00:22:33,123 --> 00:22:35,940
âª Keeping my head to the curb âª

499
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,295
Callie, why won't you look at me?

500
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:43,832
Are you breaking up with me?

501
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:45,764
Is that it?

502
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,270
âª I'm prayin' to catch you whispering âª

503
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:51,054
âª I'm prayin' you catch me âª

504
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:52,808
Maybe instead of dragging this out...

505
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:56,245
âª I'm prayin' you catch me âª

506
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:59,595
âª I'm prayin' you catch me âª

507
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:01,750
maybe we should just call it now.

508
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:03,458
âª I'm prayin' you catch me listening âª

509
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:05,487
(Voice breaking) Yeah,
we should. You should go.

510
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:08,757
âª I'm prayin' to catch you whispering âª

511
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:11,493
âª I'm prayin' you catch me âª

512
00:23:13,463 --> 00:23:15,664
âª I'm prayin' you catch me âª

513
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,802
âª I'm prayin' you catch me âª

514
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:23,472
âª [Dramatic Music] âª

515
00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:36,547
I told you to go.

516
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,575
And I'm really bad at
following directions.

517
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:52,519
I hurt you.

518
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:55,604
- You sure did.
- And I'm so sorry about that.

519
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:58,139
Boy, my sister really hates you.

520
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:00,742
Yeah. Clearly, you
told her all about me.

521
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:04,045
Well, to be fair, I told
her all the good stuff first.

522
00:24:06,229 --> 00:24:07,686
I've missed you.

523
00:24:07,886 --> 00:24:10,719
- Yeah?
- Well, relax. Like...

524
00:24:11,508 --> 00:24:13,792
I mean, not like sad or, like,

525
00:24:13,802 --> 00:24:17,559
you know, love-sick miss
you. I manly miss you.

526
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:20,328
Like, I'm very tough.

527
00:24:20,363 --> 00:24:22,894
Look, I talked to Dr.
Shepherd about your surgery.

528
00:24:22,904 --> 00:24:24,633
And she's got this.

529
00:24:24,852 --> 00:24:26,972
You're gonna make it
through this. I know it.

530
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:30,095
That's great, because I look way hotter

531
00:24:30,105 --> 00:24:31,773
when I'm not in a hospital gown.

532
00:24:31,807 --> 00:24:33,566
(Laughs) Yeah, I remember.

533
00:24:33,576 --> 00:24:35,610
(Chuckles)

534
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:39,164
So, what's our plan...

535
00:24:40,803 --> 00:24:42,918
with you and I after all this is over?

536
00:24:42,952 --> 00:24:45,610
- What?
- Yeah, when I'm well

537
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:49,676
and I'm done with this place,
we should go away together.

538
00:24:49,686 --> 00:24:51,259
I can't go somewhere.

539
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:52,661
Come on. Have fun.

540
00:24:52,695 --> 00:24:54,453
- Live a little.
- Okay. Like where?

541
00:24:54,463 --> 00:24:56,666
I have a bunch of gigs
lined up in Europe.

542
00:24:56,676 --> 00:24:57,795
Mm-hmm.

543
00:24:57,805 --> 00:24:59,405
Come on tour with me for like a month.

544
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,348
I'm a surgeon, not a groupie.

545
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:02,577
Come on. You know you
want to see me play.

546
00:25:02,587 --> 00:25:04,234
I do, actually.

547
00:25:04,244 --> 00:25:07,002
But, you know, I'd
probably just embarrass you,

548
00:25:07,012 --> 00:25:09,788
acting a fool, you know, screaming
your name in the front row.

549
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:12,100
- I'm excited to see that.
- No, you think you are.

550
00:25:12,134 --> 00:25:14,180
You have not seen me act like a fool.

551
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,037
- I'd throw my bra on the stage.
- Please do that.

552
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:17,739
(Chuckling) Shut up.

553
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:19,908
âª

554
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,751
Listen...

555
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:31,452
I, um...

556
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:37,213
I am in this...

557
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:40,361
kind of deep with you,

558
00:25:40,493 --> 00:25:42,177
so just...

559
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:46,381
don't say these things if
you don't mean them, okay?

560
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:48,066
Okay.

561
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:10,504
(Door opens)

562
00:26:13,091 --> 00:26:15,091
I have to take him to surgery.

563
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:32,698
Oh, yeah. Okay, it's
invaded the pleural space.

564
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:35,146
- Chest wall's involved.
- We'll debride the top layer off.

565
00:26:35,156 --> 00:26:37,685
Go deeper. Get the
pericardium if you have to.

566
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,320
I don't want to peel
this kid down to nothing.

567
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:41,709
And I don't want this kid to have to go
through all this and still be infected.

568
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:43,312
- Go deeper!
- Grey, come on.

569
00:26:43,322 --> 00:26:45,393
Sorry. I've had enough
of bad decisions today.

570
00:26:45,427 --> 00:26:47,776
- Yeah, well, what did I do?
- Relax, mate. It's probably me.

571
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:50,164
No, she's just pissed that Shepherd
and Hunt are getting married.

572
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:51,554
- Really?
- That's nice, actually.

573
00:26:51,564 --> 00:26:53,401
They're not. They had a conversation.

574
00:26:53,435 --> 00:26:55,670
All right, so she's pissed about
them getting married someday.

575
00:26:55,704 --> 00:26:57,617
- Why's that?
- There's a kid on the table

576
00:26:57,627 --> 00:26:59,747
whose flesh is being eaten
alive right in front of us.

577
00:26:59,757 --> 00:27:01,009
Can we please just focus?

578
00:27:01,043 --> 00:27:03,102
Well, if you want to hand
me a half a cup of Drano,

579
00:27:03,112 --> 00:27:05,089
I'll get it done in a jiffy.

580
00:27:05,381 --> 00:27:07,686
- You think that's funny?
- Little bit.

581
00:27:07,696 --> 00:27:09,179
I'm trying to say we're well aware

582
00:27:09,189 --> 00:27:11,156
of who's on the table
and what the stakes are.

583
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:14,478
We're all working as fast as we can.
We're all on the same page, Grey.

584
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:19,169
You're not more interested in saving
a life than the rest of us. Mayo.

585
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,029
Antibiotic irrigation.

586
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:27,810
What'd you have?

587
00:27:28,174 --> 00:27:31,637
Young kid with advanced nec
fasc. I just hope I got it all.

588
00:27:31,672 --> 00:27:35,754
I hear you. I've got a ventricular
washout on a massive brain abscess.

589
00:27:35,764 --> 00:27:37,748
Sounds last-ditch. Sorry.

590
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:40,808
Well, not necessarily. I...
feel pretty good about it.

591
00:27:40,818 --> 00:27:42,210
Okay.

592
00:27:43,743 --> 00:27:45,264
I do.

593
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:47,954
Well, you feel really good
about a lot of things, so...

594
00:27:47,988 --> 00:27:49,681
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

595
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:52,358
Just... just forget about it.

596
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:54,857
Is it a problem for you, Owen and me?

597
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:56,681
Is that... is that what
you're talking about?

598
00:27:56,691 --> 00:27:58,408
Let's not. You have surgery.

599
00:27:58,418 --> 00:28:00,576
- I can handle it.
- Can you?

600
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:02,207
- Because it seems like...
- Like what?

601
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:03,436
like you don't even see it.

602
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:05,247
You think you're
making all these choices

603
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:08,035
and building this life when
none of this is actually yours.

604
00:28:08,045 --> 00:28:09,438
That doesn't even make sense.

605
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:12,421
It does make sense. You
are living in my house,

606
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:16,091
helping to take care of
my children with my sister.

607
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:19,488
You are marrying my best friend's ex.

608
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:22,174
You are trying to do my husband's job.

609
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:26,201
You know, you used to have
humility, even a little anxiety,

610
00:28:26,584 --> 00:28:29,378
and now you even have his confidence.

611
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:32,813
But why not? Because you've
taken over everything else.

612
00:28:33,196 --> 00:28:35,987
- What are you saying?
- Get your own life.

613
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:37,671
You have surgery.

614
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:50,135
Noah, you really don't
have to stay here.

615
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,716
Listen, this may all be nothing to you,
but it doesn't mean that I don't care,

616
00:28:53,726 --> 00:28:56,399
- okay, about you and the kid.
- I didn't say it was nothing.

617
00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:58,587
Oh, right. Sorry. Sex.

618
00:28:58,622 --> 00:29:00,805
You were using me for my stick shift.

619
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:04,088
Noah, for God's sake,
that is not what I said.

620
00:29:04,098 --> 00:29:06,061
- Excuse me.
- Hi. We have an update.

621
00:29:06,096 --> 00:29:07,930
- Okay.
- The surgery went well.

622
00:29:07,964 --> 00:29:10,666
We believe we were able to
resect all of the infected tissue.

623
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,350
Rhys was very lucky. If you
hadn't brought him in when you did,

624
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,304
we probably wouldn't
have been so successful.

625
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:16,605
Oh, wow.

626
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:18,340
Okay.

627
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,504
- Okay.
- It's okay.

628
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:21,510
- Thank you.
- He's gonna be okay.

629
00:29:21,838 --> 00:29:23,950
He's here because of you.

630
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,084
(Scoffs) He would've died, and
he didn't because of you. Right?

631
00:29:29,516 --> 00:29:31,754
Yeah, kind of. Um, yeah.

632
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,903
You are a hero.

633
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:36,563
I mean, I just did
what needed to be done.

634
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:40,521
Wow.

635
00:29:41,432 --> 00:29:42,752
Okay.

636
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:44,833
Well, good luck.

637
00:29:47,881 --> 00:29:50,569
See? Happy endings... they happen.

638
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:53,537
Oh, please. Everyone's
in love in a foxhole.

639
00:29:53,547 --> 00:29:55,578
- What?
- He saved her kid.

640
00:29:55,612 --> 00:29:57,822
That's like post-traumatic
stress romance.

641
00:29:57,832 --> 00:29:59,379
You know what? Give it a rest.

642
00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:01,908
Just because you choose to be unhappy
doesn't mean everybody else has to.

643
00:30:01,918 --> 00:30:04,924
- Not true. Not always a choice.
- You have chances, you know?

644
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:07,156
You're hot, you're smart, you're funny.

645
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,192
Maybe Thorpe didn't work out, but that
doesn't mean you have to stop trying.

646
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:13,804
And it sure as hell doesn't mean
you get to crap on everyone else.

647
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:15,698
And, yeah, I'm gonna have a big wedding,

648
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:18,436
and you're gonna be there 'cause
you're gonna be my best man!

649
00:30:18,446 --> 00:30:19,930
Deal with it!

650
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:22,502
Doctor.

651
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,205
(Heart monitor beeping)

652
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,377
Hi.

653
00:30:29,946 --> 00:30:34,583
Um... is there any way that I
could also have Sofia tonight?

654
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:36,218
I know we already moved things around,

655
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,019
and thank you again so much, by the way.

656
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:39,488
It's just I really need to...

657
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:44,093
Could I have her tonight, please?

658
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:46,563
It's just... it's been a tough day.

659
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:49,438
You're right. We already
did move things around.

660
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:52,415
Or rather, I already moved
things around... for you.

661
00:30:52,425 --> 00:30:54,436
I know, and I thought that's why
you would be okay with letting...

662
00:30:54,471 --> 00:30:57,146
With bending the rules
for your convenience?

663
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:58,240
The rules that only exist

664
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:01,989
because you put us and all
of our friends through hell?

665
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:06,799
- No. I'm sorry. I just...
- You know, you chose this.

666
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:09,518
You ruined everything.

667
00:31:09,552 --> 00:31:13,170
And yet you still expect me to
leap to fulfill your needs. But...

668
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,709
(Scoffs) I did that. I
did that this morning.

669
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:19,578
Okay, Arizona, I get it. You're angry.

670
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:21,630
I wasn't angry.

671
00:31:22,222 --> 00:31:23,756
I was gracious.

672
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:26,301
I was nice and I was accommodating

673
00:31:26,336 --> 00:31:28,270
and I tried to help you,

674
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:31,240
and yet here you are
again, asking for even more.

675
00:31:31,274 --> 00:31:34,243
I... I do not have any more to give you.

676
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:36,889
You have used up all of my grace.

677
00:31:55,965 --> 00:31:58,190
(Sniffles)

678
00:31:58,989 --> 00:32:02,304
- Blake, what's wrong?
- Oh, Dr. Grey, I, um...

679
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:05,857
I am gathering my things. I'm
leaving for the fellowship.

680
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:07,509
- Already?
- Mm-hmm.

681
00:32:07,544 --> 00:32:11,436
My time line, um... (voice
breaking) accelerated a bit.

682
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,533
Callie and I broke up.

683
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:20,877
- Aw.
- I came here for her.

684
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:24,471
I stayed for her. I...

685
00:32:25,436 --> 00:32:27,239
thought we were gonna be together.

686
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,733
Doesn't really matter
what I thought. (Chuckles)

687
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,093
We're over. (Sighs)

688
00:32:37,226 --> 00:32:39,742
We don't... work anymore.

689
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:45,263
Sorry. I had no idea.

690
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:53,456
(Crying)

691
00:32:59,615 --> 00:33:01,296
You'll be okay, Blake.

692
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:04,622
(Sighs)

693
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:08,573
You will be okay. You
will pick yourself up,

694
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:11,183
and you will go kick
some fellowship ass.

695
00:33:11,402 --> 00:33:13,388
- Right?
- Thank you.

696
00:33:15,248 --> 00:33:18,180
For teaching me, for... for everything.

697
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:20,821
- It's my job.
- (Chuckles)

698
00:33:23,051 --> 00:33:25,464
(Parson James' "Waiting Game" plays)

699
00:33:26,101 --> 00:33:28,757
- 50 cc syringe.
- Another one?

700
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:32,292
There's more in there. Keep
irrigating until it clears out.

701
00:33:34,631 --> 00:33:36,895
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What?

702
00:33:36,905 --> 00:33:38,575
There's too much fluid
coming out, and it's cloudy.

703
00:33:38,585 --> 00:33:40,413
- So the abscess is...
- Ruptured into his ventricles.

704
00:33:40,423 --> 00:33:42,012
Okay, then we just need to move faster.

705
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:44,940
More irrigation! Keep the
syringes coming... fast!

706
00:33:44,974 --> 00:33:48,520
âª I've been praying âª

707
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:50,176
(Rapid beeping)

708
00:33:50,186 --> 00:33:52,364
Damn it. It is getting harder
to withdraw anything at all now.

709
00:33:52,374 --> 00:33:54,283
His B.P.'s starting to rise.

710
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:56,185
Come on, Kyle. Come on.

711
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:59,354
âª I've been searching âª

712
00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:02,457
Stop. I need you to stop irrigating
and run up to the gallery right now.

713
00:34:02,492 --> 00:34:03,725
What? Why?

714
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,360
I don't want her watching this.

715
00:34:05,395 --> 00:34:10,799
âª I've been working, working,
working myself to the bone âª

716
00:34:10,992 --> 00:34:12,767
I'm gonna try moving
the catheter around.

717
00:34:12,777 --> 00:34:15,637
- He's getting bradycardic.
- Come on. Come on.

718
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:20,211
âª I'm gonna tear down these
walls if I don't get out âª

719
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:24,754
âª There's just this waiting game âª

720
00:34:24,764 --> 00:34:28,936
âª And I don't know how to play âª

721
00:34:28,946 --> 00:34:34,763
âª It's enough of a fight
staying alive anyway âª

722
00:34:37,877 --> 00:34:42,047
âª Yes, there's this waiting game âª

723
00:34:42,057 --> 00:34:46,160
âª I don't know how to play âª

724
00:34:46,195 --> 00:34:52,195
âª It's enough of a fight
staying alive anyway âª

725
00:34:53,114 --> 00:34:54,354
(Panting)

726
00:34:54,364 --> 00:34:56,940
Steph, you shouldn't be watching this.

727
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,402
Oh, no. (Humming)

728
00:35:31,894 --> 00:35:36,064
(Sobbing) No! No! No!

729
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:40,898
No. No.

730
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:43,673
(Sniffles)

731
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,521
(Sobbing continues)

732
00:35:46,798 --> 00:35:47,901
Edwards.

733
00:35:48,803 --> 00:35:50,534
- (Sniffles)
- Stephanie, stop.

734
00:35:53,428 --> 00:35:55,358
We tried everything we could.

735
00:35:55,368 --> 00:35:59,043
His brain had already
infarcted from herniation.

736
00:36:00,209 --> 00:36:01,866
It was too far gone.

737
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:06,217
I'm so sorry.

738
00:36:14,528 --> 00:36:17,315
And she's standing there with these
sad eyes like she's the victim.

739
00:36:17,325 --> 00:36:21,176
She's not the victim. Callie caused
all this, she set it all in motion,

740
00:36:21,186 --> 00:36:23,169
and now here we are and
there's not one part of it

741
00:36:23,203 --> 00:36:24,825
that doesn't suck, you know?

742
00:36:24,835 --> 00:36:26,655
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I do.

743
00:36:26,665 --> 00:36:28,949
- Good night, Robbins.
- Good night.

744
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:33,263
Jackson, hey. Uh, I e-mailed you
the video and the 3-D ultrasound.

745
00:36:33,273 --> 00:36:34,550
Did you get it?

746
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,682
âª

747
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,427
(Sighs)

748
00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:53,487
- You ready?
- Ready.

749
00:37:08,297 --> 00:37:10,306
There you are, baby.

750
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:14,991
I couldn't wait till next week
to see you. I hope you don't mind.

751
00:37:17,203 --> 00:37:19,325
Thank God.

752
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,959
Mm. Mm.

753
00:37:23,297 --> 00:37:25,665
(Smoke alarm beeping)

754
00:37:26,048 --> 00:37:28,381
Did you catch the place on fire?

755
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:31,370
I'm sorry. I was trying
to make us dinner.

756
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:34,674
Ugh. Should I order pizza or Thai?

757
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:36,806
(Beeping stops)

758
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:41,092
Jo, I'm ready.

759
00:37:41,102 --> 00:37:43,354
I know. I'm sorry. I'm starving, too.

760
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:45,561
No, I'm ready to get married.

761
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:46,819
I have proposed to you twice,

762
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:48,554
and you still haven't
given me an answer.

763
00:37:48,588 --> 00:37:50,790
I bought you a ring. You
told me not to get rid of it,

764
00:37:50,824 --> 00:37:52,745
so it's just sitting in
a drawer, collecting dust.

765
00:37:52,755 --> 00:37:54,861
- I know.
- No, I'm ready to be married,

766
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:57,369
and I need to know
when you will be ready.

767
00:37:57,624 --> 00:37:59,076
It doesn't have to be today or tomorrow,

768
00:37:59,086 --> 00:38:00,859
but I need to know it's gonna happen.

769
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:03,337
I need to know that you're
up for this, 'cause I am.

770
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,841
Look, I'm not scared of
being committed to you.

771
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:06,762
I want to be married to you.

772
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,739
But I'm done waiting. So I just
need to know, will you marry me?

773
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:14,113
Oh, God. Okay. Okay.

774
00:38:14,147 --> 00:38:16,382
(Breathes deeply)

775
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:18,552
I w...

776
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:23,238
Alex, I can't.

777
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,952
Of course you can.

778
00:38:27,376 --> 00:38:29,891
- Alex...
- I don't need a big thing.

779
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,659
I just need you.

780
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:35,284
I'm so sorry, but...

781
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:38,576
no.

782
00:38:38,876 --> 00:38:40,072
<i>You know that thing?</i>

783
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:44,245
<i>That terrible thing you thought you
had laid to rest? What if you didn't?</i>

784
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,633
- Well?
- (Chuckles) It's great.

785
00:38:46,643 --> 00:38:48,582
Owen, it's really great.

786
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,383
Wait till you see the inside.

787
00:38:50,393 --> 00:38:53,185
âª My eyes ain't used to these rays âª

788
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,253
âª I'm feeling exposed âª

789
00:38:54,287 --> 00:38:56,396
What's wrong? What's wrong?

790
00:38:57,525 --> 00:38:59,232
My patient died today.

791
00:38:59,242 --> 00:39:00,659
Oh, I'm sorry.

792
00:39:00,694 --> 00:39:04,785
I thought I knew what I was
doing, but... he still died.

793
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:08,100
I thought I knew what I was doing.

794
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:11,396
âª What was I so afraid of? âª

795
00:39:12,862 --> 00:39:16,373
You and I... we're good, right?

796
00:39:17,615 --> 00:39:20,984
I mean, this is real between us.

797
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:24,407
We know what we're doing.

798
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:26,488
I think we do.

799
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:30,922
Why aren't we doing it? Why
aren't we building our life?

800
00:39:30,932 --> 00:39:33,132
I don't want to waste our time

801
00:39:33,142 --> 00:39:36,726
on conversations or some
hypothetical lives someday.

802
00:39:36,736 --> 00:39:38,138
I...

803
00:39:40,105 --> 00:39:41,899
I want a real life...

804
00:39:43,446 --> 00:39:45,048
and I want it with you.

805
00:39:47,294 --> 00:39:49,687
Are you asking me to marry you?

806
00:39:50,706 --> 00:39:52,086
- Yes.
- We're not talking

807
00:39:52,096 --> 00:39:54,907
about the fake married. We're
talking about the real married.

808
00:39:54,917 --> 00:39:56,246
Real...

809
00:39:56,856 --> 00:39:58,058
Owen.

810
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:01,594
Completely real.

811
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:06,956
Will you marry me?

812
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:12,439
<i>You know that thing... you
think you finally figured out.</i>

813
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:16,102
<i>What if you haven't?</i>

814
00:40:16,136 --> 00:40:19,839
âª Every part of me is beautiful âª

815
00:40:19,873 --> 00:40:22,241
(Car alarm chirps)

816
00:40:22,275 --> 00:40:24,510
I didn't mean to startle you.

817
00:40:24,544 --> 00:40:25,945
âª A masterpiece âª

818
00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:28,280
- Hell of a save today.
- Thank you.

819
00:40:28,315 --> 00:40:29,929
(Trunk beeps)

820
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:31,510
- Night.
- Night.

821
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,322
- Hope you feel better.
- I feel fine.

822
00:40:33,332 --> 00:40:35,588
- Yeah, right.
- What did you say?

823
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:37,256
Nothing. Forget it.

824
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,724
What did you say?

825
00:40:38,758 --> 00:40:42,795
âª And now I see the pretty
colors on my canvas âª

826
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:45,413
You turned that O.R.
into a minefield today.

827
00:40:45,423 --> 00:40:46,966
- Everybody felt it.
- And?

828
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,985
I mean, I see why you're
pissed. I would be, too, I bet.

829
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:52,705
- She's your sister, right?
- Who?

830
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:54,416
- Your dead husband.
- Don't talk about him.

831
00:40:54,426 --> 00:40:57,031
Amelia Shepherd's his sister,
you had this great thing with him,

832
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:59,817
now he's gone and she's here, and...

833
00:41:00,244 --> 00:41:02,446
she gets to get all
the good stuff, right?

834
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:04,300
With Hunt, of all people.

835
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,951
Everyone else is so happy about it,

836
00:41:05,986 --> 00:41:09,922
and all it does is make you
want to punch her in the face.

837
00:41:11,797 --> 00:41:13,677
- Am I close?
- I can see why Owen hates you.

838
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:16,160
(Chuckling) Hey, I'm trying to
be nice here, empathize a little.

839
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,486
We both lost people.

840
00:41:17,496 --> 00:41:19,307
That doesn't mean we
belong to some club.

841
00:41:19,317 --> 00:41:20,836
- Now, that's just mean.
- So?

842
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:23,703
- So don't be like that.
- I should be like you...

843
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:25,766
Laid-back and cool?

844
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:28,007
Can anyone ever get a rise out of you?

845
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:29,718
- People have, yeah.
- Like who? Owen?

846
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:31,699
- All right, don't bring him up.
- You brought up my dead husband.

847
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:33,441
- Yeah, to be nice.
- Well, don't be nice.

848
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:35,069
- Well, don't be mean.
- I'll do whatever I want.

849
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,592
- Yeah? Well, so will I!
- Me too.

850
00:41:36,602 --> 00:41:38,187
Well, what do you want?

851
00:41:38,197 --> 00:41:41,362
<i>When do you know you've
put something to bed?</i>

852
00:41:41,372 --> 00:41:43,489
<i>When is it finally safe to move on?</i>

853
00:41:43,523 --> 00:41:44,957
<i>Maybe you never know.</i>

854
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:48,648
<i>Maybe you just have to test the water.</i>

855
00:41:48,658 --> 00:41:50,329
<i>You have to see how it feels.</i>

856
00:41:50,363 --> 00:41:51,873
Okay, this could make things a little...

857
00:41:51,883 --> 00:41:52,958
Just shut up.

858
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:56,535
<i>And if it feels good,
I mean, really good,</i>

859
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:00,472
<i>then, hell, I say go for it.</i>

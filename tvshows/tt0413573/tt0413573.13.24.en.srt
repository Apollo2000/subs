1
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:07,555
<i>When life forces us
to do something impossible...</i>

2
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,960
<i>...an explosion happens inside the body.</i>

3
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:17,998
<i>A rush of hormones blasts through us,</i>

4
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:19,334
<i>making us stronger...</i>

5
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,068
- What the hell?
<i>- ...making us faster.</i>

6
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:24,404
<i>Biology overrides fear.</i>

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,407
<i>And that makes the impossible possible.</i>

8
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:30,377
- Okay, so, either
this is a drill or it's a real fire.

9
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:31,478
And if it's a real fire,

10
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:33,513
then it probably has something
to do with the guy,

11
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:35,048
so I vote drill.

12
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,917
Despite that large boom
you just heard? Really?

13
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:41,053
All right, fine. It's the guy.
The bad, escaped-rapist guy.

14
00:00:41,088 --> 00:00:41,854
Why? Why?!

15
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:44,323
Oh! The door's unlocked.

16
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,892
Well, yeah, fire would
override a lockdown.

17
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,528
I'm gonna go find Stephanie.

18
00:00:49,564 --> 00:00:53,198
Just be careful.

19
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:02,047
Then entryway is closed, ma'am.

20
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:03,185
I just watched an explosion up there!

21
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:05,243
And I already reported it.
The hospital's on lockdown.

22
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,110
Whoa! Did you see that?

23
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:06,978
- Something exploded up there.
- Yes.

24
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:09,046
This entrance way will remain closed.

25
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:10,426
- East, South.
- Possibly in the South Wing?

26
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,349
Four or five floors up.

27
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:12,483
- That's right near the NICU.
- And the CCU.

28
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:13,484
- We have to get in there!
- Yeah, we need to get in there.

29
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,350
- There was an explosion!
- He won't let us in!

30
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:17,053
They're clear to come in.
I need their help.

31
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:19,556
- There's a lockdown!
- I ordered the damn lockdown!

32
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:22,225
Fire in the hospital
trumps rapist on the loose.

33
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:23,594
They are cleared!

34
00:01:25,097 --> 00:01:27,077
- There's a rapist on the loose?
- Where have you been?

35
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:30,132
We have a multiple-alarm
fire on floors five and six,

36
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:31,301
from the service elevators east.

37
00:01:31,336 --> 00:01:33,636
And we are concerned about
structural damage on that floor.

38
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:35,971
We're diverting all incoming traumas.

39
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:37,940
Patients in immediate
or impending danger

40
00:01:37,975 --> 00:01:39,409
need to be evacuated first.

41
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:42,412
Unaffected areas... the E.R., radiology,

42
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:44,947
nursery, daycare... they stay put.

43
00:01:44,982 --> 00:01:46,282
We have to prioritize.

44
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:48,149
Firefighter Carroll here
will be directing you

45
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:49,785
to the most urgent areas.

46
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,887
Yeah, and, uh, the woman with
her arm in the air over there

47
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:53,755
is Dr. Kepner.

48
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,425
She is setting up a holding area...?

49
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,627
Outside by Parking Lot 1.

50
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:02,163
By Parking Lot 1.
Take evacuated patients to her.

51
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:03,431
She is in charge.

52
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:05,966
And if your patients can walk,
they can transport themselves.

53
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,336
Okay, thank you Dr. Grey.
Do not be a hero. Okay?

54
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:11,004
If they can walk, let them walk.
Carry the rest.

55
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,241
The elevators are<i> not</i> working.
Do not try and use them.

56
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:16,143
- Work fast, but work safe.
- Okay.

57
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,780
And our man's still at large,

58
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:21,748
so we're maintaining security
at the exits,

59
00:02:21,783 --> 00:02:22,915
and we're keeping active sweeps.

60
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:26,619
Hmm. Because just one hospital
emergency wasn't enough...

61
00:02:26,655 --> 00:02:29,121
Lord, don't make me
have to tell Catherine Avery

62
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:30,957
I burned her hospital to the ground.

63
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:31,958
Edwards?

64
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,496
Stephanie!

65
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,450
Edwards?!

66
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,033
Go, go, go! Stephanie?

67
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:58,883
Maggie.

68
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:00,852
- Hey, take this to Kepner outside.
- Right away.

69
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:02,854
I've been texting you. Are you okay?

70
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,889
They're trying to
contain it near the CCU,

71
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:06,791
but I heard it spread to the O.R. floor.

72
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:08,626
I just figured I'd help with evac.

73
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:10,194
- Have you seen Nathan?
- No.

74
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:11,478
No, and don't... don't go thinking

75
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:12,405
he's been burnt to a fiery crisp.

76
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:13,339
I'm sure he's fine.

77
00:03:13,374 --> 00:03:14,564
No, I'm not. I'm just...
I need to speak with him.

78
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,331
So, if you see him...

79
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:16,533
- Yeah.
- ...please let him know.

80
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:17,967
I'm legit, I swear!

81
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:20,169
High alert in progress, sir.
I need to see some I.D.

82
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:22,038
I don't have it. My wife has my wallet.

83
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:23,907
Our baby's upstairs
for observation. Please!

84
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:24,941
Is there a problem?

85
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:26,843
Y-You got to help me!
I've looked everywhere.

86
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,878
I went... I checked the...
the cafeteria, the gift shop,

87
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:30,145
I-I tried looking outside
and looking there...

88
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,013
What are you looking for?

89
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:34,082
My daughter. Erin. She's missing again.

90
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:35,651
Help.

91
00:03:35,686 --> 00:03:38,687
Help me!

92
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:46,694
Stephanie?

93
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:56,571
Help!

94
00:03:57,808 --> 00:03:59,273
Erin?

95
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:02,043
Stephanie?

96
00:04:02,078 --> 00:04:06,547
Erin! Erin, where are you?

97
00:04:06,582 --> 00:04:10,050
Don't do that! I thought you were dead!

98
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:11,685
I thought you were gone!

99
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,798
- Stephanie?
- Yeah. Erin, uh, hang on!

100
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,800
Hang on!

101
00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:28,935
I don't like this.

102
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,104
Don't worry, uh, uh, Sondra.
You'll be fine, all right?

103
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,307
Um, you're just gonna get
a bit of fresh air, all right?

104
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:36,581
Okay, we got Mr. Pruitt
downstairs safe and sound.

105
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:37,687
Who's next?

106
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:38,944
Okay, these two very capable doctors

107
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:39,778
are gonna carry you down.

108
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:40,812
Carry?

109
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,280
Yeah, you're gonna have
your own personal escort.

110
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,459
Down four flights of stairs.

111
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:45,450
But it's a smooth ride, I promise.

112
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,434
- Like Cleopatra.
- Exactly.

113
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:49,153
Okay, hurry up, okay?
This place is full.

114
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,187
We've got to move quick.

115
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:52,290
Yes, sir.

116
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,157
Come on. Let's go.

117
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,493
Just finished alerting all dispatchers

118
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:56,650
to divert their traumas.

119
00:04:56,686 --> 00:04:59,174
- Do you need hands here?
- Absolutely.

120
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,932
Hey, you guys seen Edwards anywhere?

121
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,133
I'm looking for a missing girl.

122
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,668
We don't have eyes on Edwards yet?!

123
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:05,970
No, I've been looking everywhere.

124
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:06,970
Is she missing?

125
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:08,043
Yes, yes.

126
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:10,140
The... The rapist guy in the
hospital... that's her patient.

127
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:11,508
- She's with him somewhere.
- What?

128
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:12,620
- I got to go.
- What?

129
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:14,276
Did you alert police? About Edwards?

130
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:15,411
No, no, good idea. Could you do that?

131
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:16,374
- I...
- Thank you.

132
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:17,814
We need all hands on deck, Avery!

133
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:18,915
Let him go.

134
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,017
Dr. Webber, there's a protocol
when it comes to this...

135
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:22,752
I am looking for a missing girl.

136
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:25,121
And, yes, the police
are also looking for her.

137
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:26,990
Then maybe we should let
the cops do their jobs,

138
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:28,113
we focus on patients.

139
00:05:28,148 --> 00:05:30,091
Okay, listen, she likes to run and hide.

140
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:32,027
She has brownish hair. Her name is Erin.

141
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:33,294
All right. We haven't seen her yet.

142
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,263
Grey!

143
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:37,165
- Dr. Webber...
- Look... Look, I'll be fine, Dr. Minnick.

144
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,315
Would you let the police know

145
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,801
we have a resident missing, will you?

146
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:52,212
Okay, the kids
are asleep, so it should be easy.

147
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:53,514
Ellis is just getting over a bug...

148
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,898
...so when she
wakes up, just take her temp.

149
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,520
We are gonna be on the road
for the next several hours,

150
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:01,221
but after that... texting is best.

151
00:06:05,894 --> 00:06:07,184
Hey.

152
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,854
Uh, you might want to eat something.

153
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,565
What's gonna take hours?

154
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:17,070
Owen. There's been
an explosion at Grey-Sloan.

155
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:19,237
What? What do you mean "explosion"?

156
00:06:19,273 --> 00:06:21,640
So it looks like the helipad
there is off limits.

157
00:06:21,676 --> 00:06:23,081
How many casualties?
Are there people hurt?

158
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:24,069
Why didn't you wake me?

159
00:06:24,105 --> 00:06:26,411
It only affected a few floors,
and they have got it covered.

160
00:06:26,447 --> 00:06:28,246
Look, I'm the head of trauma,
I need to be there.

161
00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:29,514
No. We have to go.

162
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,916
It's gonna take a few hours to drive

163
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:32,236
to Madigan Army Medical Center.

164
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:34,961
And we have to be there
when your sister lands.

165
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:38,381
Yeah.

166
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:41,358
They suggested you might want to
bring photographs or,

167
00:06:41,394 --> 00:06:45,362
- um, uh, keepsakes if you have any?
- Right.

168
00:06:45,398 --> 00:06:48,308
Right. Right.
Because she might not remember.

169
00:06:48,902 --> 00:06:50,343
You know what? You stay here.

170
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:52,703
I'm gonna go to the house and
see if I can find an album...

171
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:54,571
No, no. I know where everything is.

172
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:08,578
Erin, don't be scared! Just hang on!

173
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:11,253
All right, Erin?

174
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:12,354
Okay.

175
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:13,856
Fire extinguisher. Fire exting...

176
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,457
It's a lab. It's a lab. It's a lab.

177
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:19,394
There has to be
a fire extinguisher somewhere.

178
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,063
Is he gone?

179
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:22,397
Is that man gone?

180
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:26,268
Uh, yeah, yeah. He's very, very gone.

181
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:28,036
You keep your face low, okay?

182
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:29,070
You keep your face low

183
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:30,905
and stay as far away
from the fire as you can.

184
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:33,141
I can't! I...

185
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:36,444
I can't. I can't. My leg... it's stuck.

186
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:42,617
Okay. Don't worry. Uh...

187
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:44,051
I'm coming. Don't panic.

- Oh, God, just...
- Ow! Ow! Move it off, please!

190
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,054
No, no, honey, it's keeping
all the blood in your leg.

191
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:20,388
It hurts.

192
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:22,424
Uh, yeah, I know.

193
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:25,294
I know it hurts, but I can't...

194
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:26,895
I can't f... I can't move it

195
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:30,664
until I figure out how to fix your leg.

196
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,801
And I... which I...

197
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:36,270
Aah! How the hell am I gonna
fix her leg?!

198
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:38,306
Stop it! You're scaring me!

199
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:39,573
I'm sorry.

200
00:08:43,046 --> 00:08:44,645
Okay.

201
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:50,817
Okay. You...

202
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:52,418
You lucked out, Missy.

203
00:08:52,454 --> 00:08:53,419
'Cause I am...

204
00:08:53,455 --> 00:08:57,958
...the best surgeon in here.

205
00:08:57,993 --> 00:09:02,127
I do this kind of stuff in my sleep.

206
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:04,997
Ah! Okay. All right. Okay.

207
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:07,632
We're gonna figure this out,
okay, right?

208
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:09,168
Just you and me, right?

209
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:11,937
Okay.

210
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,349
Whoa!

211
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:22,685
- We'll figure it out.
- Okay, okay.

212
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,953
Right? Just you and me.

213
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:26,655
I really want my mom.

214
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,591
I know. I know. I do, too.

215
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,864
Okay.

216
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:40,501
Oh, God. Oh, hey, it's okay. It's okay!

217
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:42,303
It's okay. I got you. I got you, okay?

218
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:43,671
- All right, lie back.
- Okay.

219
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:44,772
Just lie back.

220
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:48,209
Relax as much as you can.

221
00:09:48,244 --> 00:09:50,511
You know, when I was a kid,

222
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:53,146
I was in the hospital a... a lot.

223
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:56,316
And, uh... they would have to...

224
00:09:56,351 --> 00:09:58,685
Ow! Ow! Oh, that's okay. I'm sorry.

225
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:02,522
They would do a bunch of stuff
that hurt me, too.

226
00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:04,891
And I hated it. I hated it.

227
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,693
So, do you know what I would do?

228
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:12,178
What?

229
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:17,620
- I would clench my fists, real tight
...tight as I could. - Mm-hmm.

230
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:20,906
Sometimes my, uh,
nails would dig in to my hands,

231
00:10:20,942 --> 00:10:25,310
and I would even break the skin
sometimes, but it helped.

232
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:27,746
The more I thought about my hands,

233
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:30,815
- the less I thought about anything else.
- Mm.

234
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:33,584
And sometimes I would
just scream my head off.

235
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,386
And it would drive my doctors
crazy, but...

236
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:36,387
it made me feel better.

237
00:10:36,422 --> 00:10:37,655
- Okay.
- Okay?

238
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,557
Okay.

239
00:10:39,592 --> 00:10:43,194
All right, Erin...

240
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,230
Look, what I'm about to do is
really gonna hurt, Erin.

241
00:10:46,265 --> 00:10:48,766
It's gonna hurt a lot, and so...

242
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:49,867
I want you to clench your fists.

243
00:10:49,902 --> 00:10:52,736
Clench them real tight...
as tight as you can for me.

244
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:53,971
Okay.

245
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:59,042
And if you need to scream, you
just go ahead and scream, okay?

246
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:00,977
- All right.
- Okay.

247
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:04,180
Oh, okay.

248
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:05,948
Here we go.

249
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,093
I want patients organized by
condition and severity!

250
00:11:18,128 --> 00:11:20,395
The temp CCU area needs ventilators

251
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,930
and crash carts on standby!

252
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:25,433
And please check everyone
for smoke inhalation!

253
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:27,402
Erin!

254
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,047
Erin!

255
00:11:29,973 --> 00:11:30,939
- What's going on?
- Where is...

256
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:33,408
Oh! What... We don't know.

257
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,242
A fire, explosion...

258
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:39,780
There's no kids out here.

259
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,415
How are my PEDS patients or the NICU?

260
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,385
Listen, the fire is on the
south side, like four floors up.

261
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:46,987
The kids should all be okay.

262
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:48,455
What happened with Jo's husband?

263
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,990
You never called me back.

264
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:51,625
Yeah, the trip was a waste.

265
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,592
Okay. So, I'm looking
for this little girl.

266
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:56,095
She's 8, she's super-smart,
she keeps ditching her parents.

267
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:57,596
- Look for her.
- All right.

268
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:00,300
Hey. What do we have?

269
00:12:00,335 --> 00:12:02,802
CCU patient, one-day status post.

270
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:03,937
CABG. She's stable.

271
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:06,298
She just needs to stay on
her... heparin infusion...

272
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:07,278
Are you okay?

273
00:12:07,314 --> 00:12:08,841
Yeah, it's... Yeah, yeah.

274
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:10,442
Not a big fan of fire, you know?

275
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:11,243
It's...

276
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:12,945
If I'm being honest, this is, uh...

277
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,746
kinda my worst nightmare, actually.

278
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,682
Well, just, like, imagine that
it's a parking-lot barbecue.

279
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:20,400
The smoke. The burning burgers...

280
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:21,954
Okay. All right.

281
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:23,322
You know what? Just take a minute, okay?

282
00:12:23,357 --> 00:12:24,256
Just take a minute.

283
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,324
No, no, I'm... I'm...
I'm good. I'm good.

284
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,292
You sure?

285
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:28,879
- Burnt burgers, right?
- Okay.

286
00:12:28,907 --> 00:12:29,827
Burnt burgers.

287
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:31,929
Okay. Oh, Pierce!
Can you come take a look?

288
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:34,165
Okay, I got him.

289
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,195
- Hi.
- Hi.

290
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:36,767
- Hi.
- Hi.

291
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,121
The chest sounds good.

292
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:43,512
Those handsome boys
treated me like a queen.

293
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,879
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

294
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:46,276
We're gonna get you set up in triage.

295
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:48,945
We're gonna get you attached to
an EKG machine, okay?

296
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:50,713
All right.

297
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:53,350
Hey, uh, you didn't happen to
see Jackson in there, did you?

298
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:54,517
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

299
00:12:54,552 --> 00:12:56,887
Right when the alarms went off,
and then he took off,

300
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:58,989
running after Edwards
like he was fireproof.

301
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:01,323
- He's not back yet?
- No! Of course not.

302
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:03,725
- Typical.
- Typical?

303
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:07,162
Yeah, he ran into a burning bus
once to save a child.

304
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:10,866
He's the kind of guy that runs
into a fire, apparently.

305
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:12,368
I'm sure he's fine.

306
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:13,535
Yeah. Me too.

307
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:20,975
That's okay.

308
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:22,877
All right, I just want to...

309
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:25,046
loosen this...

310
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:26,814
and see...

311
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,050
if there's less bleeding, okay?

312
00:13:29,085 --> 00:13:31,585
Uh, nope... less blood. No blood.

313
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:33,721
No blood. Good girl.

314
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:35,755
Okay.

315
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,657
All right, this is heavy. Skooch on out.

316
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,192
Skooch out. Skooch out this way.

317
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:40,994
Don't bend, don't bend, don't bend.

318
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,929
Go this direction.

319
00:13:41,964 --> 00:13:43,763
Keep going. There we go. Okay!

320
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:47,067
Get you out of here, okay? Hang on.

321
00:13:47,102 --> 00:13:48,368
Let me help you up.

322
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:49,700
Okay. Okay.

323
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:51,603
Don't put any weight on it.
Weight on me.

324
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,272
Good girl. Good girl. Good girl.

325
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:56,008
Hang on. Okay.

326
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,377
Aah!

327
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,115
How do we get around it?

328
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:04,369
Uh...

329
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,785
We ca... Well, we can't. We can't.

330
00:14:11,491 --> 00:14:13,891
Hang... Hang on. Hold up, hold up.

331
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:25,970
Okay.

332
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:30,040
Sorry.

333
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:31,108
Gonna pick you up,

334
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:33,743
and I want you to take
a big, deep breath, okay?

335
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,045
- Biggest breath you can.
- All right.

336
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:35,946
And then hold it.

337
00:14:35,982 --> 00:14:37,547
1, 2, 3, jump!

338
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,216
Good. Keep that leg straight.

339
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:42,585
Okay. Good girl, good girl.

340
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,919
All the way.

341
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,993
Okay. All right.

342
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:16,530
Here we go.

343
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:25,538
We can't go down there.

344
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:36,749
There's the roof.

345
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:43,166
Okay. Here. Come here.

346
00:15:43,202 --> 00:15:45,390
Put your arms around me,
tight as you can, okay?

347
00:15:45,426 --> 00:15:46,725
Okay. Okay.

348
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,461
Got to go up. Got to go up.

349
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:52,897
- One at a time.
- Uh-huh.

350
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:54,966
One step at a time.

351
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:01,739
One step.

352
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:05,243
One at a time. There we go.

353
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:13,288
Steph!

354
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:16,459
Edwards!

355
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:20,890
Stephanie!

356
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:21,924
Ma'am, can I help you?

357
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,992
Let me help you walk.

358
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:24,027
I don't need any help!

359
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:24,988
Aah! Aah.

360
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:26,929
Ma'am, did you just have surgery?

361
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:29,666
For God's sake, I'm not a "ma'am."

362
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:32,568
My name is Cheryl, and surgery
would be better than this.

363
00:16:32,603 --> 00:16:35,237
Being sliced open and gutted
would be better than this.

364
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:36,772
It's just kidney stones!

365
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,106
Okay. Look, no, we gotta get you
out of this hallway.

366
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:39,675
There's way too much smoke, all right?

367
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,909
I'm gonna pick you up. Is that okay?

368
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:42,944
No way!

369
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,516
I'm perfectly capable of... aah!
...of walking and... aah! Okay.

370
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:48,640
I'm sure you are.

371
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:51,018
Aah! Aah! It's just kidney stones! Aah!

372
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:04,432
Do you not hear the alarm?

373
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,866
The fire is on the floor above us!

374
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:08,968
I was midway through a
lobectomy when the alarm went off.

375
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:11,037
I'm not leaving a patient
open on the table.

376
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:14,974
Well, okay. Glove me.

377
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,643
- What the hell are you doing?
- Well, you're right.

378
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,412
You can't walk away from the patient.

379
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:20,605
And it'll be quicker
if the two of us work together.

380
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:24,483
This floor is supposed to be
clear. You need to evacuate.

381
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,052
Sir, I have a man's lung in my hand.

382
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,322
We're working as fast as we can.

383
00:17:29,357 --> 00:17:31,090
- How long do you need?
- 15 minutes.

384
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,639
15. No more.

385
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:34,293
Sir, we're looking for a missing girl.

386
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:35,661
She's 8 years old. Her name is Erin.

387
00:17:35,697 --> 00:17:36,762
We've all got our eyes out for her.

388
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:38,163
Okay. Thank you.

389
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,099
Bovie.

390
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,824
All right.

391
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:46,070
Let's get her on a morphine drip.

392
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,305
All right, you're gonna be all right.

393
00:17:47,341 --> 00:17:49,974
- We have been looking for you!
- You scared the crap out of me!

394
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:52,444
- Oh, I need some O2.
- Yeah, of course you do.

395
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:54,912
That's what happens
when you don't listen and...

396
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,648
and instead you inhale an entire
hospital full of smoke!

397
00:17:57,683 --> 00:18:01,285
- Ow. Watch it.
- Stupid heroics!

398
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,190
I was trying to help her.

399
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,325
You are a surgeon, not a firefighter!

400
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:09,993
I wasn't trying to
fight a fire, all right?!

401
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:12,195
- I was trying to save Edwards!
- Don't yell at her.

402
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:14,097
- She is the mother of your child!
- Okay...

403
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:15,965
And what would I have told Harriet?!

404
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,635
- I'm fine, April!
- Breathe.

405
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:22,037
Mm.

406
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:23,973
Yeah, still ready to go.

407
00:18:28,012 --> 00:18:30,112
Do you have room for one more?

408
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,109
You know, Megan use to call me ***

409
00:18:44,134 --> 00:18:46,763
during *** so serious.

410
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:52,199
Go ahead. You can say it.

411
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:53,501
- What?
- She was right.

412
00:18:55,237 --> 00:18:56,370
Wouldn't war make anyone grumpy?

413
00:18:58,341 --> 00:18:59,473
Not her.

414
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:01,208
Nope. She was...

415
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:03,010
She was happy.

416
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:04,878
She was always smiling
and joking and laughing.

417
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:13,252
I...

418
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:14,474
I don't know what to say.

419
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,488
I mean, how do I even...

420
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:19,025
I don't know what...
I don't know what to say

421
00:19:20,486 --> 00:19:21,894
You will.

422
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:23,919
When you see her.

423
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:27,622
You'll know what to say
when you see her.

424
00:19:32,063 --> 00:19:34,462
They found her 10 miles away
from where I was stationed.

425
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:38,202
She was right there the whole time.

426
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:42,970
Owen, your sister is alive,

427
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:46,168
and that doesn't feel real
right now, but it will.

428
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,442
When you see her.

429
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:07,227
Almost there... oh!

430
00:20:07,262 --> 00:20:08,261
- You okay?
- Yeah.

431
00:20:08,296 --> 00:20:11,098
- Okay. Almost there.
- Okay.

432
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:12,599
Almost...

433
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:15,467
Almost there.

434
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:16,635
Okay. Stand there. Good.

435
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:27,759
No.

436
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:30,249
No!

437
00:20:30,284 --> 00:20:31,582
No! No!

438
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:32,751
- No!
- What?!

439
00:20:32,786 --> 00:20:35,353
No!

440
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:36,587
What?

441
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:37,919
My key card... I don't have my key card.

442
00:20:37,954 --> 00:20:40,358
I ca... I can't get out of here
without the card.

443
00:20:43,997 --> 00:20:46,364
We can go down.

444
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:47,831
Oh, my God.

445
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,667
We can get through the fire.
We can make it.

446
00:20:57,243 --> 00:20:58,341
So we're stuck?

447
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:10,155
No. No, we're not stuck.

448
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,155
We are...

449
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,793
We're gonna sit right here
and put this over our heads,

450
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:18,460
and we're gonna be just fine,
I promise you.

451
00:21:18,496 --> 00:21:19,561
Come on.

452
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:23,865
No. That's pulling the covers
over your head.

453
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:27,502
My mom said when things
get scary, you don't do that.

454
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,105
You turn on the light
so the scary goes away.

455
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,984
Listen, your mom is right. Usually.

456
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,574
But I'm a doctor...

457
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,110
...and I know that in this case...

458
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:39,998
This blanket is our best chance, okay?

459
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:42,850
Okay?

460
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,051
Okay.

461
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:47,721
All right, come on. Let me help you.

462
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:49,756
Lean on me, lean on me, lean on me.

463
00:21:50,426 --> 00:21:52,059
Good girl. There we go.

464
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:56,062
Oh. Okay.

465
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:01,567
Okay. Hang on.

466
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:04,770
Okay.

467
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:08,297
No. The scary will get you.

468
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:09,357
The scary will get you.

469
00:22:09,392 --> 00:22:10,316
No, no, no. No, no.

470
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:11,449
Don't worry about me.
Don't worry about me, okay?

471
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:14,856
I got a lot of ways to...
to keep scary out.

472
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:31,875
Is that my card?

473
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,267
That's... That's my card!

474
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:37,701
That is my card!

475
00:22:37,737 --> 00:22:39,770
No! Stephanie, don't leave me!

476
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:41,305
No, it's okay. Don't leave me.

477
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:42,639
It's okay. I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

478
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:44,041
Keep your face covered, okay? All right?

479
00:22:44,077 --> 00:22:46,077
I... Erin, I am gonna be right back.

480
00:22:46,112 --> 00:22:48,309
Fists.

481
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:51,748
Fists. Good. Good!

482
00:22:51,783 --> 00:22:53,397
No!

483
00:22:54,152 --> 00:22:55,618
No.

484
00:22:55,653 --> 00:22:56,709
No, Stephanie!

485
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:58,388
Stephanie!

486
00:22:58,423 --> 00:23:01,557
No, don't go. Don't leave me.

487
00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:02,859
Please don't leave.

488
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:07,796
Stephanie, no.

489
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,073
- Stephanie, come back.
- Come back.

490
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,850
No. No. Stephanie!

491
00:23:23,885 --> 00:23:25,751
Stephanie, come back.

492
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,860
Stephanie...

493
00:23:36,296 --> 00:23:37,295
Please.

494
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:47,772
Stephanie!

495
00:23:52,812 --> 00:23:54,458
Let's get out of here.

496
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:03,219
Whoa!

497
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:06,155
I found him in O.R. 2.

498
00:24:06,191 --> 00:24:08,058
O.R. 2? We evacuated
that floor ages ago.

499
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:10,460
Yeah, I was in the middle of
a thoracotomy.

500
00:24:10,495 --> 00:24:12,829
Hey, Maggie, can you take over
for him there?

501
00:24:12,864 --> 00:24:13,897
You need some oxygen.

502
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:15,698
Not until my patient's stable.

503
00:24:19,904 --> 00:24:21,670
You inhaled a lot of smoke.

504
00:24:21,706 --> 00:24:23,238
Put this over your face.

505
00:24:23,273 --> 00:24:25,273
Thank you.

506
00:24:32,782 --> 00:24:34,215
- Come here.
- Okay.

507
00:24:37,754 --> 00:24:39,654
- Stay here. Stay here. Don't
move. Don't move. - Okay.

508
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:43,024
Help us! Help! Help us!

509
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:44,092
Somebody help!

510
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:46,828
Here!

511
00:24:46,863 --> 00:24:48,162
Help!

512
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:49,263
Help!

513
00:24:49,298 --> 00:24:52,032
Stephanie? Stephanie?

514
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:53,566
Oh, my God.

515
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:55,602
Wait. Erin. Wait.

516
00:24:55,638 --> 00:24:58,171
No.

517
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,372
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

518
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:00,941
Don't... No, don't, don't...

519
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:02,876
Erin! Erin! No! Erin, don't!

520
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:04,745
Hey, Erin, stay with me.

521
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,713
Erin. No.

522
00:25:07,749 --> 00:25:08,413
Stay with me, okay?

523
00:25:08,449 --> 00:25:11,751
Stay... Somebody help me!

524
00:25:11,786 --> 00:25:14,787
Somebody help me, please!

525
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:16,756
Somebody help me!

526
00:25:24,264 --> 00:25:25,797
Put your mask back on.

527
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:31,569
And... And, no, no one has seen Edwards.

528
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:34,039
- But that doesn't mean that...
- Hey, Chief!

529
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,307
Any word on Edwards? No one's
seen her since the lockdown.

530
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:39,077
I told Minnick to tell the
police that she was missing.

531
00:25:39,112 --> 00:25:41,078
But... Minnick!

532
00:25:41,113 --> 00:25:43,480
What did the cops say about Edwards?

533
00:25:43,515 --> 00:25:45,235
Oh, my God. I forgot.

534
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:47,217
You forgot?

535
00:25:47,252 --> 00:25:48,986
There were patients.

536
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:50,453
I forgot.

537
00:25:52,324 --> 00:25:54,091
I saw Edwards earlier, before the alarm.

538
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:56,293
She was, uh... She was with
a liver lac patient.

539
00:25:56,328 --> 00:25:57,312
That's him. That's the guy. What?

540
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,796
Where? Where did you see her?

541
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:01,898
It was a hallway.
Just a regular hallway.

542
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:03,566
- Where's radiology on this thing?
- All right.

543
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:05,168
When... When I saw her,
we were close to there.

544
00:26:05,203 --> 00:26:06,286
I had no idea who she was with.

545
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:07,937
If I'd realized,
I could've done something.

546
00:26:07,972 --> 00:26:09,072
Which way were they walking?

547
00:26:09,107 --> 00:26:12,008
It's just... You know what?
It's easier if I show you.

548
00:26:12,043 --> 00:26:13,642
- I could just walk you right
in there... - Benjamin Warren!

549
00:26:13,678 --> 00:26:14,910
Absolutely not.

550
00:26:14,945 --> 00:26:16,745
You're a civilian, and the fire
is not completely contained.

551
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,856
We are wasting time out here.

552
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:19,347
Agreed. If it helps us
find this guy sooner...

553
00:26:19,382 --> 00:26:21,511
No, we're seeing sporadic
flare-ups inside.

554
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,418
And giving a criminal
the perfect opportunity

555
00:26:23,453 --> 00:26:25,314
to escape the premises,
no questions asked?

556
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:26,906
- This isn't about protocol.
- Oh, hell no!

557
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:28,990
- It's about capturing a dangerous
predator. - You coming or what?!

558
00:26:30,293 --> 00:26:32,827
Let's go.

559
00:26:32,862 --> 00:26:33,928
Ohh!

560
00:26:33,963 --> 00:26:35,796
We're ready.

561
00:26:35,832 --> 00:26:36,864
Okay, hold up.

562
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:40,034
- Hold up, guys...
- I got you.

563
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:42,302
Right in here.

564
00:26:42,338 --> 00:26:44,839
Around there? Yeah, this is it!
This... This is where I saw her.

565
00:26:44,874 --> 00:26:46,040
And they were...

566
00:26:46,075 --> 00:26:49,809
They were... They were headed in
this direction. And, uh...

567
00:26:49,845 --> 00:26:51,510
They must've gone in here.

568
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:04,057
Hey.

569
00:27:04,092 --> 00:27:05,858
If she was near the explosion
when it happened,

570
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:07,359
could she... could she have survived it?

571
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:08,861
Would depend on her
proximity to the blast.

572
00:27:08,896 --> 00:27:10,562
- Captain, over here.
- Yeah.

573
00:27:10,597 --> 00:27:11,864
We got a casualty.

574
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:17,970
We have an adult.

575
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:19,604
Can I borrow your... your light?

576
00:27:22,243 --> 00:27:23,841
Help me!

577
00:27:23,877 --> 00:27:26,043
Please!

578
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,543
Somebody help me!

579
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:34,418
Stay with me. S-Stay with me.

580
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,995
No. No, see, this is too tall
to be Edwards.

581
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,496
Um...

582
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:54,031
It's blood. It is... It's blood!

583
00:27:54,948 --> 00:27:57,273
There's blood over here.

584
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:00,109
All right, let's go.

585
00:28:08,452 --> 00:28:10,085
Edwards!

586
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:10,920
Edwards, you all right?!

587
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,188
- I'm fine! I'm fine!
- Are you hurt?!

588
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,355
She needs an I.V. access and air!

589
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,624
Send an ambu bag and a frickin' gurney!

590
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:19,961
Right. On it. Let's go!

591
00:28:19,996 --> 00:28:22,130
Did you take the scenic route?!

592
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,942
They were on the roof!
The patient coded.

593
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:33,051
She needs as much O neg as possible

594
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,277
and get her typed and crossed!

595
00:28:34,332 --> 00:28:35,981
Okay, okay. Get her to Trauma One.

596
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,873
Edwards, we got this. You can get down.

597
00:28:37,908 --> 00:28:40,341
No, ma'am! She needs to go
straight to the O.R.

598
00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:42,711
No, O.R. floor is inaccessible.
The fire...

599
00:28:42,746 --> 00:28:44,579
She's not gonna make it. She
needs to be treated here, now.

600
00:28:44,614 --> 00:28:45,881
Edwards, you're injured. You need...

601
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:48,315
She needs blood and a defibrillator now!

602
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,583
I deep-fried a rapist.

603
00:28:49,618 --> 00:28:52,053
I... I dove through a wall of fire.

604
00:28:52,088 --> 00:28:52,987
I did not do all of that

605
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,989
so that this little girl
could die, okay?

606
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,058
She... I saved her. I saved her.
I saved her.

607
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:58,142
I saved her, Dr. Bailey.

608
00:28:58,177 --> 00:29:00,094
We need to finish saving her right now,

609
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:01,729
and I need you out of my face!

610
00:29:01,764 --> 00:29:04,398
- Dr. Bailey!
- You heard her.

611
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:07,646
Get out of her face.
This E.R. is now an O.R.

612
00:29:13,474 --> 00:29:16,509
She's back in sinus.
Pressure's holding at 70.

613
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:20,379
Yeah, this leg is still cyanotic.

614
00:29:20,415 --> 00:29:22,781
- Should we amputate?
- No, save the leg.

615
00:29:22,817 --> 00:29:24,449
We save the leg.

616
00:29:24,484 --> 00:29:27,252
That son of a bitch does not get
to cost this girl her leg.

617
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:28,453
Dr. Bailey, please.

618
00:29:28,488 --> 00:29:29,722
We'll need to do a graft.

619
00:29:29,757 --> 00:29:32,390
Okay. Let's throw a shunt in,
and it'll give the leg a chance.

620
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:12,828
All right. How is she?

621
00:30:12,864 --> 00:30:15,831
We're prepping to do a graft
to save her leg.

622
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:19,468
You need to be lying down, Stephanie.

623
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:20,853
- Let me take a look at these burns.
- No, not yet, not yet.

624
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:23,139
Okay, look, you need to
at least be hydrated, okay?

625
00:30:23,174 --> 00:30:25,265
Will you stay there?
Let me just take care of this.

626
00:30:25,877 --> 00:30:28,051
- Did you get the proximal end?
- Oh, yeah, I got it, I got it.

627
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:29,444
You need to isolate the distal.

628
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,511
How's she doing?

629
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:32,120
Her BP's steady, sats are 96.

630
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,365
Which means she's finally stable.

631
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,432
Mm-hmm.

632
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:38,869
She's gonna make it through this
and keep the leg.

633
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:39,887
Oh, my God.

634
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,723
You got her back, Edwards.

635
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,409
Now you need to get yourself back, okay?

636
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:46,509
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

637
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:47,676
Gurney!

638
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:48,811
All right, let's get
her on a bed right away.

639
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:51,580
All right, her adrenaline faded.
Pain's probably set in.

640
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,683
Yeah, it's the body's way of
protecting itself from the pain.

641
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:55,791
- Got her head?
- Yep.

642
00:30:55,827 --> 00:30:56,752
All right, okay.

643
00:30:56,787 --> 00:30:58,253
Okay, let's get back to work.

644
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:12,901
- Hey.
- Hey.

645
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,102
You okay?

646
00:31:15,138 --> 00:31:17,071
Yeah, I think so.

647
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:20,153
You sure?

648
00:31:21,143 --> 00:31:23,276
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry if I scared you.

649
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,430
I'm... I was fine. I'm fine.

650
00:31:26,448 --> 00:31:28,181
It's just, you're gonna need to breathe.

651
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:30,751
When I... when I tell you
what I have to tell you,

652
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:35,589
so... take a deep breath for me
so I know that you can.

653
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:39,959
- What do you mean?
- What do you want to tell me?

654
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,594
Take a deep breath for me.

655
00:31:57,343 --> 00:32:01,112
Okay. So...

656
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:02,779
Remember the dream...

657
00:32:03,684 --> 00:32:05,949
where they come back to us?

658
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,619
Hmm?

659
00:32:07,654 --> 00:32:11,489
Derek forgets his keys,
and Megan goes for...

660
00:32:11,524 --> 00:32:14,157
For coffee. Yeah. What... What about it?

661
00:32:16,295 --> 00:32:18,328
Nathan, they found Megan.

662
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:19,597
She's alive.

663
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,238
That's not funny.

664
00:32:28,273 --> 00:32:30,573
The Army called Owen this morning.

665
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:39,180
That's not funny.

666
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,772
Shh, shh.

667
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:08,709
Okay. It's okay.

668
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:11,345
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

669
00:33:12,548 --> 00:33:14,115
Shh.

670
00:33:22,891 --> 00:33:24,858
Major Hunt.

671
00:33:24,893 --> 00:33:26,726
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Mm-hmm.

672
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:28,227
I'm Lieutenant Hill.
This is Colonel Turner.

673
00:33:28,263 --> 00:33:30,697
Glad you guys
could make it on such short notice.

674
00:33:30,732 --> 00:33:32,699
If there's anything you need,
don't hesitate to ask.

675
00:33:32,734 --> 00:33:35,234
- We're here for you.
- We appreciate it.

676
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,569
Absolutely, ma'am.

677
00:33:36,604 --> 00:33:38,792
If you'll just walk this way.

678
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:42,741
I know it's hard to know
exactly what to expect,

679
00:33:42,777 --> 00:33:43,809
so you should be prepared.

680
00:33:43,844 --> 00:33:46,478
She may not know who you are.

681
00:33:47,715 --> 00:33:49,815
She may not trust where she is.

682
00:33:54,721 --> 00:33:55,787
She could be fine,

683
00:33:55,822 --> 00:33:57,588
or she may communicate in extremes.

684
00:33:57,623 --> 00:33:58,622
There could be yelling.

685
00:33:58,658 --> 00:34:01,559
So it's best to avoid
any potential triggers,

686
00:34:01,594 --> 00:34:03,895
any sudden movements, sudden noises...

687
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,731
anything like that.

688
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,697
And why did it take us so long
to find them?

689
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:26,804
I was sidetracked by treating
patients, which is my job.

690
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:29,473
- I was doing my job.
- Right.

691
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:32,575
- That "protocol" states that...
- I'm sorry.

692
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:35,077
If anyone could follow protocol
around here,

693
00:34:35,113 --> 00:34:37,714
Edwards would be
perfectly fine right now.

694
00:34:37,749 --> 00:34:38,743
I'm sorry. What?

695
00:34:38,779 --> 00:34:40,883
She was supposed to be in counseling.

696
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:42,419
But Dr. Webber over here decided

697
00:34:42,454 --> 00:34:43,820
she should be able to work today.

698
00:34:43,855 --> 00:34:46,423
If you hadn't completely
undermined me...

699
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:48,253
- If I hadn't compl...
- Then a little girl would be dead!

700
00:34:51,228 --> 00:34:53,094
Dr. Minnick...

701
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,263
I don't believe that

702
00:34:55,299 --> 00:34:57,766
there's a place for you
in my hospital any longer.

703
00:34:57,802 --> 00:34:59,273
Dr. Bailey, hold on.

704
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:01,704
It's<i> Chief</i> Bailey,
and I am not holding on.

705
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:03,739
She is holding on.

706
00:35:03,774 --> 00:35:07,274
She is... is clinging to these
procedures and protocols

707
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,425
and cannot see when to let go

708
00:35:09,461 --> 00:35:12,347
in order to save the life
of a patient... a child!

709
00:35:12,382 --> 00:35:14,081
<i>I</i> do! I know!

710
00:35:14,116 --> 00:35:16,217
Because I was taught right.

711
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:21,055
Dr. Edwards certainly knew,
because she was taught... right.

712
00:35:26,094 --> 00:35:30,230
This is not some factory
that turns out surgical robots.

713
00:35:30,265 --> 00:35:32,098
We make doctors.

714
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:36,159
Thinking, feeling, human doctors.

715
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:39,439
And we will teach them right.

716
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:46,144
- Hey. You're not going home?
- Uh, nope.

717
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,646
Incoming's two minutes out.

718
00:35:47,682 --> 00:35:49,915
Well, look, I just wanted to, um...

719
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,751
say I'm sorry about earlier.

720
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:53,986
I yelled at Jackson
when I shouldn't have...

721
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:57,322
Well, he was an idiot,
and he almost died, so...

722
00:35:57,358 --> 00:35:59,257
I just meant that, you know...

723
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:02,159
He's your baby's father,
and I went too far.

724
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:03,777
I was just mad because he and I

725
00:36:03,812 --> 00:36:05,365
had been talking earlier
when the alarms went off...

726
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,898
Maggie.

727
00:36:08,201 --> 00:36:09,534
What?

728
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,337
Jackson, he, uh...

729
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:15,238
He likes you.

730
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,007
I know him, so I know
what that looks like.

731
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:18,642
And, uh...

732
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,343
He likes you. He has feelings for you.

733
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,344
No, he doesn't.

734
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,650
Why would you even...

735
00:36:22,686 --> 00:36:24,247
Because I have a feeling
that you like him, too,

736
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:25,416
so you know what?

737
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:26,617
You should just tell him.

738
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:27,651
I got to get out there.

739
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,292
- Hey. Long night?
- Yeah.

740
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,294
You want to go back to my place?
Sleep it off?

741
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,530
Or maybe do some other stuff
before we sleep it off?

742
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,231
And by "other things," I mean sex.

743
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,033
You want to go have
some overly tired sex?

744
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:45,367
I shouldn't. I have to pack up.

745
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:46,869
Pack up what?

746
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:48,304
I just got fired.

747
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:55,076
Wha...

748
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:56,110
I'm so sorry, but you know

749
00:36:56,146 --> 00:36:57,879
I'm gonna have to
do this again today, right?

750
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:58,780
Mm-hmm.

751
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,049
Oh, it's looking good,
it's looking good.

752
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:04,486
Edwards, I can turn up the morphine.

753
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:05,753
You don't need to be in this much pain.

754
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:07,054
Not yet, not yet.

755
00:37:13,128 --> 00:37:14,161
Mnh!

756
00:37:16,532 --> 00:37:18,198
Mnh.

757
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,003
How're you feeling?

758
00:37:24,038 --> 00:37:26,539
I've had better days.

759
00:37:29,277 --> 00:37:32,445
- Your burns are severe.
- Mm-hmm.

760
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:34,944
But we are all with you.

761
00:37:35,484 --> 00:37:37,697
We are gonna get you back.

762
00:37:38,453 --> 00:37:42,420
But, uh... it'll be a while
before you step in an O.R.

763
00:37:42,456 --> 00:37:45,791
Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, about that.

764
00:37:45,826 --> 00:37:47,860
I've spent my whole life in hospitals.

765
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,464
My whole life, and...

766
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,163
I... I think I need to see everything

767
00:37:55,198 --> 00:37:57,201
that's not the inside of a hospital.

768
00:37:59,506 --> 00:38:05,576
I need to travel and...
and explore and... and hike

769
00:38:05,612 --> 00:38:08,245
and... and breathe... and breathe...

770
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,615
Okay.

771
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,249
Breathe...

772
00:38:12,284 --> 00:38:14,751
Breathe... real air.

773
00:38:17,155 --> 00:38:19,455
So deep. I want to breathe it all in.

774
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:22,225
Away from the monitors
and the blood and the...

775
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,395
and the sterile gowns,

776
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,430
away from saving other people's lives.

777
00:38:27,465 --> 00:38:31,299
I want my own. It's time...
It's time I live my own.

778
00:38:35,472 --> 00:38:39,300
You changed my life, Dr. Webber.

779
00:38:41,512 --> 00:38:46,181
You have. You... You taught me how...

780
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:53,220
You taught me how to take my
past and find my path.

781
00:38:56,392 --> 00:38:58,259
Thank you. Thank you.

782
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,161
I think I found it.

783
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:04,365
Which means?

784
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,137
Which means I quit.

785
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,473
Mnh.

786
00:39:13,508 --> 00:39:15,042
Okay, DeLuca, turn that morphine up

787
00:39:15,077 --> 00:39:16,342
as high as it'll go, please.

788
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:25,017
Hoo.

789
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:38,930
Nathan? Are you okay?

790
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:42,363
Where was she?

791
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:44,736
I don't know.

792
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:46,671
Well, who had her? Is she hurt?

793
00:39:46,707 --> 00:39:49,040
I wish I knew more.

794
00:39:49,076 --> 00:39:50,408
Do we know for sure it's her?

795
00:39:50,443 --> 00:39:51,931
I mean, have they confirmed that?

796
00:39:51,966 --> 00:39:56,003
Apparently so. I'm... not really
sure how it works.

797
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:57,681
Where is she now?

798
00:39:57,717 --> 00:39:59,505
Oh.

799
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:07,224
They're taking her to
Madigan Army Medical Center.

800
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:09,559
Owen and Amelia are on their way now.

801
00:40:10,763 --> 00:40:13,730
Tell, uh, Pierce I... I had to go.

802
00:40:13,765 --> 00:40:16,165
Okay. Wait. Are... Are you okay?

803
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,566
Can you drive? And someone
needs to contact my patients.

804
00:40:17,602 --> 00:40:19,368
Tell them that I finished surgery.

805
00:40:19,403 --> 00:40:20,436
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.

806
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:22,605
Are you okay to drive?
Do you want me to take you?

807
00:40:23,942 --> 00:40:25,742
Megan's alive?

808
00:40:25,777 --> 00:40:27,076
Megan's alive.

809
00:40:34,362 --> 00:40:35,466
Oh.

810
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:40,957
I'm sorry.

811
00:40:40,992 --> 00:40:42,791
Don't. Don't do that.

812
00:40:42,826 --> 00:40:45,360
- No.
- Don't do that. Don't apologize.

813
00:40:45,395 --> 00:40:48,529
If this were Derek,
I would've already been gone.

814
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:52,066
Okay. I can drive.

815
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:57,638
Get out of here! Go! I can drive.

816

<i>Nobody wakes up thinking,
"My world will explode today."</i>

817
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:09,582
<i>"My world will change."</i>

818
00:41:16,624 --> 00:41:19,059
<i>Nobody thinks that.</i>

819
00:41:19,094 --> 00:41:21,794
<i>But, sometimes, it happens.</i>

820
00:41:23,297 --> 00:41:26,065
<i>Sometimes, we wake up,
we face our fears...</i>

821
00:41:42,849 --> 00:41:45,149
<i>We take them by the hand.</i>

822
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:03,800
<i>And we stand there, waiting...</i>

823
00:42:03,836 --> 00:42:06,169
<i>...hoping, ready...</i>

824
00:42:06,205 --> 00:42:08,705
<i>...for anything.</i>

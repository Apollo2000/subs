1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,573
When I was little, I once said my mother.

2
00:00:03,573 --> 00:00:06,298
How do you tell people
such that bad news?

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,279
You tell them the truth, she said.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,395
<i>"But you tell them
the best version of the truth</i>

5
00:00:12,397 --> 00:00:14,898
<i>you can come up with."</i>

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,567
<i>My mother also never told me
I had a little sister.</i>

7
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:20,804
<i>So, grain of salt.</i>

8
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:22,906
What are you doing up?

9
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:24,708
Couldn't sleep.

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,947
Neither could Ellis. She wants some milk.

11
00:00:26,948 --> 00:00:29,015
Are Owen and Amelia falling in love,

12
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:30,984
or are they just falling back into bed?

13
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:33,153
That's what's keeping you up at night?

14
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:35,188
Not Jackson's disappearing act?

15
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,123
Jackson sent me a picture of a tree.

16
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,826
A picture of a tree? Why?

17
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:41,094
Look, what I'm saying is,

18
00:00:41,096 --> 00:00:42,762
if there's something
that Amelia can't see coming

19
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:45,632
that's gonna pop out and ruin everything,

20
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:47,200
she should know about it, right?

21
00:00:47,202 --> 00:00:50,236
Like you didn't see
the Jackson thing coming?

22
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:52,172
No. Jackson's coming back.

23
00:00:52,174 --> 00:00:53,473
Is that what he said?

24
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,510
- The tree.
- What does a tree have to do,

25
00:00:57,512 --> 00:00:59,112
And what if there is something coming

26
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:03,116
for Owen and Amelia
and there's no undoing it?

27
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:05,151
Like, there's no picture of a tree

28
00:01:05,153 --> 00:01:06,653
that could begin to undo it?

29
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:08,488
Do you need a sedative?

30
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,390
Mama.

31
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:15,295
Go back to bed.

32
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:17,030
Owen and Amelia are fine.

33
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:20,500
I am not being ridiculous.
<i>You</i> are being ridiculous.

34
00:01:20,502 --> 00:01:21,968
God, you are such a hag!

35
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,603
Hey, hey, hey, I just got Leo back down,

36
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:25,305
so could we bring the volume
down, please?

37
00:01:25,307 --> 00:01:27,240
We ha...

38
00:01:27,242 --> 00:01:28,908
We had one rule, you do not do drugs.

39
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,176
Well, great,
'cause I didn't do any drugs.

40
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:31,878
Oh, you walked through
that door high as a kite,

41
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,912
and if you think that I can't,

42
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:35,615
Sorry, Leo.

43
00:01:36,985 --> 00:01:38,218
Listen, she had a slip.

44
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,452
I'm not sure shaming her about it,

45
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:41,221
I'm not shaming her about a slip.

46
00:01:41,223 --> 00:01:42,389
I can handle a slip.

47
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:43,957
What I will not abide is for her

48
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,292
to stand here in my house,
- <i>My</i> house.

49
00:01:46,294 --> 00:01:48,561
In your house and lie right to my face.

50
00:01:48,563 --> 00:01:50,964
That is not okay. That is unacceptable,

51
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:52,999
and I would think that I would
get a little backup from you.

52
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:55,902
- I backed you up.
- You said, "Hey."

53
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:57,170
Well, what do you want to do?

54
00:01:57,172 --> 00:01:58,405
Well, I can't do what I want to do,

55
00:01:58,407 --> 00:01:59,672
or we'd have to hide her body.

56
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:01,241
God, this is how my mom must have felt.

57
00:02:01,243 --> 00:02:02,475
Let's go to bed.

58
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:03,777
We'll think more clearly
about this in the morning.

59
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:05,545
Okay? Come on.

60
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:07,280
- Hag.
- You know what?

61
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:10,316
If you are gonna call me names,
call me names to my face!

62
00:02:11,953 --> 00:02:13,153
Great.

63
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:18,691
Okay, you're not here
right now, and, trust me,

64
00:02:18,693 --> 00:02:20,727
you really want to be.

65
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:23,163
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
My mind won't shut off.

66
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:26,332
Mm. And something else won't turn on.

67
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:28,168
Why did I take this stupid job?

68
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,369
Because you'll be awesome at it.

69
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:31,171
No, no, no, no. I'm an awesome surgeon.

70
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:32,572
I suck at this.

71
00:02:32,574 --> 00:02:34,541
And all anyone does is ask for stuff.

72
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,613
So, Bailey and I are finally

73
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:42,982
on the same page with my fellowship.

74
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:45,919
I'm gonna pitch that
we get an INUMAC MRI.

75
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:47,353
Wait.

76
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:49,422
You want an INUMAC MRI?

77
00:02:49,424 --> 00:02:51,191
Mm-hmm. Everyone can use it.

78
00:02:51,193 --> 00:02:52,959
It'll pay for itself eventually.

79
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:55,161
Mmm.

80
00:02:55,163 --> 00:02:57,197
Are you hitting me up for money

81
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,398
with your hand on my, uh...

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,700
What? Wait. Wait. No! What? No!

83
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:02,569
Alex, my hand was already
there from before.

84
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:03,903
What, No.

85
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:06,306
Alex, you are the one who
wanted to talk about work.

86
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:07,740
Where are you going?

87
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:11,277
- You made me feel dirty, real dirty.
- Oh, my,

88
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:13,079
I wish I could make you feel dirty.

89
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:14,948
Oh, that's nice. That's real nice.

90
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,117
Alex, couldn't you just, Oh, my, Where,

91
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:20,086
Come back to bed!

92
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,263
Hey, Chief, um,

93
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:33,399
I just saw the funding for my
prosthetics project is frozen?

94
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:35,568
Mm, temporarily. Budget issues.

95
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,736
Oh, man.

96
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:38,171
We're gonna take that out
on little kids, though?

97
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:40,240
Yes, and I know it's unfair, so save it.

98
00:03:41,977 --> 00:03:43,676
Whoa.

99
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:44,711
Morning, Dr. Grey.

100
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:46,312
Good morning, Dr. Lincoln.

101
00:03:46,314 --> 00:03:48,781
- Who's up, Helm?
- A Mr. Saether.

102
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:51,985
He's here for his, Whoa.

103
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,887
Uh, new makeup?

104
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:55,822
Is there something wrong with it?

105
00:03:55,824 --> 00:03:57,090
- No.
- No.

106
00:03:58,826 --> 00:04:00,648
_

107
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:02,649
_

108
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:05,068
_

109
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:07,634
- Did Papa die?
- No. Andrea!

110
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:08,935
Why would you say that?

111
00:04:08,937 --> 00:04:10,525
You know why.

112
00:04:11,072 --> 00:04:13,206
Look, just don't let him drag
you into his crazy,

113
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,574
I know, but,

114
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:15,775
- Wow.
- Hi.

115
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:18,545
Do you need something?

116
00:04:18,547 --> 00:04:19,979
Uh, no, nothing. Sorry.

117
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:23,516
I just, You look really, um,
You look very... uh,

118
00:04:23,518 --> 00:04:25,184
- Capable.
- Capable today.

119
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:27,620
Thank you. Uh... hi.

120

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

121
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:41,668
What?

122
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,303
I don't want to leave town

123
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:46,639
when you're about to make
a great big fool of yourself

124
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:48,508
over your lady boss.

125
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,511
Oh, shut up. I'm not,

126
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:53,746
I'm, No, I'm,

127
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:54,847
Shut up.

128
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:56,416
I'm not listening.

129
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,252
Small apartment fire.

130
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:01,187
This guy got the worst of it.

131
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:03,122
Let's skip the trauma room and
head straight to the burn unit.

132
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:04,190
Hold the elevator!

133
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:05,425
I can take him up. I know the way.

134
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:06,392
Thanks, Warren.

135
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:11,731
Herrera, what did you bring me?

136
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:13,833
40-year-old female,
unconscious at the scene,

137
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:17,270
persistently hypotensive,
pulse 120, resps 24.

138
00:05:17,272 --> 00:05:18,338
No evidence of trauma.

139
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,772
Okay. Any smoke inhalation?

140
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:21,107
She wasn't even in the fire.

141
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:22,575
She was evacuated with the other tenants,

142
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:24,077
and then she collapsed
on the street outside.

143
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,511
- Let's get her inside.
- Shoot. Where'd he go?

144
00:05:25,513 --> 00:05:26,952
- Who?
- Max, her kid.

145
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:28,481
He was, He was right here.

146
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:33,733
You Max?

147
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:36,422
Oh. You okay? You, You hurt?

148
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:39,425
- No.
- Oh. Just scared?

149
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:42,962
Yeah, uh, well, you don't
have to be scared.

150
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:45,098
We're all gonna help your mom, okay?

151
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,568
You want to come inside with me?

152
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:53,940
Hey.

153
00:06:06,988 --> 00:06:08,254
Hey. No school?

154
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:10,023
I have school. I've been abducted.

155
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:11,724
She's grounded. But first we're,

156
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:13,559
Uh, you're not my mom,
so this is not grounding.

157
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:15,328
- It's child abduction.
- Go sit.

158
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,797
Transport me across state lines,
it becomes a federal offense.

159
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,068
Schmitt, would you get me
a 10-panel tox screen, please,

160
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,925
- right now?
- Oh, I...

161
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:25,772
Okay.

162
00:06:25,774 --> 00:06:27,120
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:29,175
You brought her here for a drug test

164
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:30,343
and she went along with it?

165
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:31,778
Well, she doesn't know yet.

166
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,680
Uh, would you watch her?
I got to go change.

167
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:35,014
Yep.

168
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:36,749
Hey.

169
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:40,620
I seriously don't know how you
were ever married to her.

170
00:06:40,622 --> 00:06:42,455
- She is so extra.
- She is a little extra.

171
00:06:42,457 --> 00:06:43,720
Yeah, I agree.

172
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:45,758
- Meredith.
- Hmm?

173
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,262
If Zola got high, you would
ground her, right?

174
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:52,164
- What?
- Look at you. What happened?

175
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,599
You have a funeral?

176
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:55,401
What's wrong with you? You look weird.

177
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,203
She's wearing makeup. She looks pretty.

178
00:06:57,205 --> 00:06:58,371
Why?

179
00:06:58,373 --> 00:07:00,239
Oh, my God, you have a date.

180
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:02,108
Ah! You're doing it!

181
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,977
Ah! You're letting Mrs. Santa
Claus bring you presents!

182
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,913
All I got was a lousy tree.

183
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:07,980
Where are you going?

184
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:09,682
- Drinks? Coffee?
- Lunch.

185
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:11,217
Lunch? Lunch is boring.

186
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:12,985
You can't make lunch last all night.

187
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:15,221
So, who is he? Pics, please.

188
00:07:15,223 --> 00:07:17,523
No, no, that's not how
Mrs. Santa Claus works.

189
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:18,725
No pictures.

190
00:07:18,727 --> 00:07:21,327
What's she hiding? Neck beard? Man bun?

191
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:23,296
- Ear hair?
- No. She wants people to meet

192
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:27,133
how they meet in real life,
with no preconceived notions.

193
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:28,668
Scary. I like it.

194
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,169
Damn it.

195
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:31,137
Have fun.

196
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,940
Cancel your afternoon, for luck.

197
00:07:38,513 --> 00:07:39,846
What if I hate him on sight?

198
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:41,881
What's the minimum amount
of time this goes?

199
00:07:41,883 --> 00:07:43,483
Well, assuming your waiter doesn't suck,

200
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:45,418
a tight 30 minutes, if you don't
want to hurt his feelings.

201
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,533
Okay.

202
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:51,524
Five bucks says I can get out
in 20 and spare his feelings.

203
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:52,959
All right, but no pretending
you get paged.

204
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:54,026
That's cheating.

205
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:55,928
It's $1 for every minute you go over 20.

206
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,663
I'll text you in 20 minutes.

207
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:00,233
Oh.

208
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:02,007
Thank you for making it fun.

209
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,440
Hey, she just went into V-fib.

210
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:09,842
40-year-old female, lost consciousness.

211
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:11,711
Charge to 200.

212
00:08:11,713 --> 00:08:13,146
Clear.

213
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:17,750
Hey. Hey, Natalie.

214
00:08:17,752 --> 00:08:18,885
Okay. Back in sinus.

215
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:19,952
Okay.

216
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:22,088
You are in the hospital. You passed out.

217
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,957
Max. Max!

218
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,526
My son.

219
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:27,760
Where's my son?

220
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:29,028
Okay, Natalie, I need you to be still.

221
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,730
He's right out in the waiting room.

222
00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:32,198
Bring him here.

223
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
I need to see him.
I need to see he's okay.

224
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:35,968
- Okay. X-ray's there.
- Okay.

225
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,043
Sorry. It's just...

226
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:40,754
Max likes to know what's going on...

227
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:44,477
to be told what's gonna happen,
or, or he gets scared.

228
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,545
I get that.

229
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:47,146
He's coming.

230
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:49,081
She has left ventricular enlargement,

231
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,250
pulmonary edema, and a pleural effusion.

232
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:52,652
- We need a TEE.
- Yep.

233
00:08:52,654 --> 00:08:56,055
I just, just need to...

234
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:57,356
Just...

235
00:08:57,358 --> 00:08:58,758
Natalie.

236
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,992
Book an OR now.

237
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:03,729
Mom!

238
00:09:03,731 --> 00:09:05,364
- Mom!
- Max, Max, come here.

239
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:07,366
- Mom! Mom!
- Hey, please. Come on.

00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:43,952
- Sorry. Hey. Are you,
- Hi. Jon?

242
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:45,687
- Yes. Hi.
- Hi.

243
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:47,889
Uh, they said there's a bit of a
wait, but we can sit at the bar.

244
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:49,531
Okay. Let's start the clock.

245
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,161
I just meant, I mean,
let's just get started.

246
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:55,464
Yeah. Okay.

247
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,632
All right.

248
00:09:57,634 --> 00:09:59,234
- That's a nice coat.
- Thank you.

249
00:09:59,236 --> 00:10:00,235
- Nice purse.
- Thanks.

250
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:01,903
- The whole thing's working.
- Thank you.

251
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:08,032
You, Oh, uh, Max, we called your dad.

252
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:09,800
He's on his way. Your mom is stable.

253
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:11,602
She's getting prepped
for surgery right now.

254
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:14,705
Uh, and a nice woman
is on her way to sit with you.

255
00:10:14,707 --> 00:10:18,109
I'll sit with you, Max, until
the social worker gets here.

256
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:21,112
Oh, thanks. Okay, uh, I'll be back soon.

257
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:24,482
Did you just put us on babysitting duty?

258
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:26,517
We have to get checked by a doctor

259
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,386
after every fire incident now,
anyway, so...

260
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:30,254
Um, are we really doing that?

261
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,355
Captain's orders.

262
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:32,782
Sit.

263
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:39,597
I'm good, guys, yeah. I'm not even burnt.

264
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:41,365
I was just delivering food.

265
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:43,918
Not even my building.
It's not even my fire.

266
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,970
And if the smoke got into your lungs...

267
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:47,405
Got to take a look.

268
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:49,607
It says here your emergency
contact is your mom?

269
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:50,975
No, don't call my mom!

270
00:10:50,977 --> 00:10:52,877
No, she, she lives in Philly.
She'll just worry.

271
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,112
Also, uh, I go to U-Dub,

272
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:57,348
and I have class in an hour,
so, uh, I should,

273
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,783
I'll write you a note. Open wide.

274
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:00,518
I have a chem test. Say, "Ahh."

275
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,553
Also, it's a makeup test.

276
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:04,155
It's like a make-it-or-break-it.

277
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:05,590
It's my last chance.

278
00:11:05,592 --> 00:11:06,691
I should just go.

279
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:08,593
You need a chest X-ray first.

280
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:10,861
X-rays? Doesn't that cost extra?

281
00:11:10,863 --> 00:11:12,496
Oh, you don't need to worry about that.

282
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:13,631
Wait. But...

283
00:11:17,003 --> 00:11:18,436
Max. Buddy.

284
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:20,705
- Dad!
- Where's Mom?

285
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:22,440
Hi. Are you Natalie's husband?

286
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:24,475
Yeah. Uh, Evan. Evan Forrester.

287
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:26,644
Hey. I'm Dr. Bailey. This is Dr. Pierce.

288
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:29,113
Um, has your wife been
complaining of any heart,

289
00:11:29,115 --> 00:11:31,015
H-Hang on. Sorry.

290
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:32,550
Go ahead. Sit down, son. It's okay.

291
00:11:32,552 --> 00:11:34,118
Go ahead.

292
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,120
<i>Dr. Bradshaw, call Recovery.</i>

293
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:37,722
<i>Dr. Bradshaw, call Recovery.</i>

294
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:39,590
We think your wife had
a recent heart attack,

295
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:41,559
and now the wall between the
two main chambers of her heart

296
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:43,427
- has ruptured.
- Is it,

297
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:44,695
We won't know how much damage there is

298
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:47,198
until we can get in there,
but we will keep you updated.

299
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,699
- Okay?
- Okay.

300
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:50,868
Um, hey.

301
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:53,938
I know you like to know what's going on.

302
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,441
Okay, so, we're gonna take your
mom to the operating room, okay?

303
00:11:57,443 --> 00:11:58,909
She's having some trouble with her heart,

304
00:11:58,911 --> 00:12:02,546
but we are gonna do everything
we can to fix her, okay?

305
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:04,115
Okay.

306
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:05,716
Okay.

307
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:08,819
<i>Dr. Monroe, call the pharmacy.
Dr. Monroe, call the pharmacy.</i>

308
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:10,621
Well, I think we're good to go.

309
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,189
Are we in that big of a rush?

310
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,726
I kind of want to see how
the kid's mom comes out.

311
00:12:15,728 --> 00:12:17,895
And what was her name again?

312
00:12:17,897 --> 00:12:19,130
Uh... The cardio doc.

313
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:20,682
Dr. Pierce.

314
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:23,501
Dean. Really?

315
00:12:23,503 --> 00:12:25,002
Did you see that woman?

316
00:12:25,004 --> 00:12:26,704
Did you see her self-assuredness,

317
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:28,305
her compassion for children,

318
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:31,175
and her very, very nice eyes?

319
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:34,045
Look, we also got to wait
for a doctor's check, right?

320
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:36,013
- Oh, now you want to do that?
- Mm.

321
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:37,348
Mm-hmm. Captain's orders.

322
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:41,619
Hey! You still here?

323
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:44,121
- Hey. Yeah.
- Just, uh, Just heading out.

324
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:45,990
What have you got in your hand?

325
00:12:45,992 --> 00:12:48,125
I-I don't have anything in my hand.

326
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:49,961
Show me your hand.

327
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:54,865
Uh, I-it's nothing.

328
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:56,667
I-It's nothing, a little burn.

329
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:59,236
I had to check a door for heat.

330
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,205
It's my first injury.

331
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:02,907
Had to happen sometime.

332
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:10,648
You see this thin sac in
the wall of Julius' lung?

333
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,450
He's got a pulmonary bleb.

334
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:14,285
Ugh. "Bleb."

335
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:16,854
It's air trapped in
the lining of the lung.

336
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:19,223
Yeah, I know what it is.
I just hate how it sounds,

337
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:20,424
"bleb."

338
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:23,060
- What's it stand for?
- It doesn't. It's a word.

339
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:25,896
It's not a word. It's a sound effect.

340
00:13:25,898 --> 00:13:26,897
"Bleb."

341
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:28,232
Well, if it bursts,

342
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:30,434
his lung collapses, and Julius dies.

343
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:35,206
It should be a less funny word.

344
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:37,641
Suction.

345
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:41,011
Now, what is Avery doing, exactly?

346
00:13:41,013 --> 00:13:44,849
I don't, Um, something to do with God,

347
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:47,184
uh, and a tree.

348
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:48,185
Like a sabbatical?

349
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:49,420
Yeah. Yeah.

350
00:13:49,422 --> 00:13:52,490
Uh, exactly, like a,
a spiritual sabbatical.

351
00:13:52,492 --> 00:13:54,258
Where he just decides overnight

352
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,160
to run off and do what he wants?

353
00:13:56,162 --> 00:13:58,329
Yeah, sounds like spiritual spring break.

354
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:04,778
Oh, damn it. Damn it. You see there?

355
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:07,104
That is a big ventricular septal rupture.

356
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:09,206
She probably had a heart attack
a week ago,

357
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,407
thought it was indigestion,

358
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:12,443
and now it's just been weakening
ever since.

359
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:13,811
- Irrigation.
- Yeah.

360
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:16,213
- What do you want to do?
- I want to close the defect.

361
00:14:16,215 --> 00:14:17,248
Bovine patch.

362
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,216
Herrera said she was down for a while.

363
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:23,187
I know, but I, I don't
want to go down there

364
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:25,456
and tell that little boy
that his mother is gone.

365
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:31,829
Uh, let's try a temporary LVAD
and... hope.

366
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:39,738
- So, you're in software?
- Mm-hmm.

367
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,246
Where is the T-shirt and hoodie?

368
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:43,738
I know. I tried.

369
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,906
It just feels like wearing
your pajamas to work,

370
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:47,141
- you know?
- I do know.

371
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:49,443
I actually wear my pajamas
to work, sort of.

372
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:50,911
- I'm a surgeon.
- You are?

373
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:52,780
- Mm-hmm.
- What kind?

374
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:55,416
Um, I'm Chief of General at Grey-Sloan.

375
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:56,550
Wow.

376
00:14:56,552 --> 00:14:57,985
So, you're a big deal.

377
00:14:57,987 --> 00:14:59,053
Oh, yeah.

378
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:00,187
What kind of software?

379
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:02,223
I'm not supposed to tell you.

380
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:03,758
It's privacy stuff.

381
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,659
Oh. I get it.

382
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:09,497
No, I mean, it's, uh,
actually privacy software.

383
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:10,598
- Oh.
- I'm telling you.

384
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,167
I don't care.
I'm terrible at keeping secrets.

385
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:14,435
I just think we should be able to decide

386
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:16,458
what we want to tell the world
about ourselves

387
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,139
and who should get to see it.

388
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:20,307
My software lets you do that.

389
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,575
- That's all.
- Oh.

390
00:15:21,577 --> 00:15:24,245
So, you're not mining people's data or...

391
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:26,947
The opposite, actually, protecting it.

392
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:29,116
Mm. Here's to the good guys.

393
00:15:29,118 --> 00:15:30,951
I mean, I'm not cutting
people's cancer out

394
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:32,753
in my pajamas or anything, but...

395
00:15:32,755 --> 00:15:34,188
Mm. But you do what you can.

396
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,923
I do what I can.

397
00:15:37,392 --> 00:15:39,560
Look, if it bursts,
your lung could collapse.

398
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:40,795
It puts you at risk.

399
00:15:40,797 --> 00:15:42,430
I know. I know all about my bleb.

400
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:43,898
I've had it since I was a baby.

401
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,166
Why do you guys call it that?

402
00:15:45,168 --> 00:15:47,301
Right?

403
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:50,037
Anyway, I'm not doing
a marathon anytime soon,

404
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,872
unless it's video games.

405
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:54,375
- I'm okay. I get along fine.
- Yeah, until now.

406
00:15:54,377 --> 00:15:56,477
The smoke you inhaled is making
your lungs work harder.

407
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:58,412
And your bleb is making them
work too hard.

408
00:15:58,414 --> 00:16:00,181
But I can operate.
I can take it out for good.

409
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:01,449
No. No surgery.

410
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:02,650
My mom's insurance,

411
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:04,752
it, it only covers emergency-room visits.

412
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:06,754
My stupid bleb's
a pre-existing condition.

413
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:08,956
If we called your mom, she would
say, "Let's figure it out."

414
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,691
No. No, my mom already works three jobs

415
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:12,326
just to keep me
in food and clothes, okay?

416
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:15,229
The surgery will, will put us
20 grand in the hole.

417
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:16,897
Just let me out of here, or,

418
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:18,699
or I'll talk to your supervisor, okay?

419
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:22,236
I <i>am</i> my supervisor.

420
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:24,305
Well, Well, don't call my mom.

421
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:27,074
If you tell my mom, I'll sue you guys.

422
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:29,310
Then all of our money problems
will be gone.

423
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:30,444
Okay?

424
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,615
- Can't we just take it out, anyway?
- Kid's 18.

425
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:36,016
Doing it anyway would be assault.

426
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:38,452
Start him on continuous nebs and 40% O2

427
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:40,688
- and, uh, slow-roll his discharge.
- Okay.

428
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:44,458
We need to talk about last night.

429
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,580
That was insulting.

430
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:47,428
Oh, it was, and I accept your apology.

431
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,497
You need to apologize to me, dummy.

432
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:50,498
I don't have sex with you

433
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,932
because I want stuff from the chief.

434
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:53,567
I have sex with you 'cause
I want one thing from you,

435
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:55,035
orgasms!

436
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:57,738
And maybe you should tell me

437
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,039
when Webber's standing behind me

438
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,175
so I don't say things like that.

439
00:17:07,183 --> 00:17:09,717
You... paged me, Karev?

440
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:11,085
Has Schmitt been back yet?

441
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:12,286
Uh, haven't seen him.

442
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:13,654
What are we even doing here?

443
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:15,456
Dr. Shepherd, here you go.

444
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,757
Sorry it took so long.

445
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,459
I have a really shy bladder.

446
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:22,129
What? Why? Whose is, Why?

447
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:23,464
You said you wanted a drug test.

448
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:25,432
I figured because
of that time with the cookies,

449
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:27,801
- but I am not,
- Not from you.

450
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,236
- For her!
- Yeah.

451
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:32,406
I am so sorry.

452
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:34,208
Hey, hey, hey.
Take that with you, please.

453
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,609
You brought me here for a drug test?

454
00:17:35,611 --> 00:17:37,611
- What the hell?!
- Whoa, whoa, workplace.

455
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:39,146
You're not lying, so what's the big deal?

456
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:40,714
The big deal is you trusting me

457
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:42,116
and not treating me like a criminal.

458
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:43,684
- Hey. Wh...
- Where are you going?

459
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:46,353
To daycare, to see Leo. Geez!

460
00:17:49,892 --> 00:17:51,392
This is stupid.

461
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:53,260
- We're going.
- Hey, we're waiting to get checked.

462
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:55,329
No. We <i>were</i> waiting. Now we're stalking.

463
00:17:55,331 --> 00:17:57,031
Any doctor can check us out.

464
00:17:57,033 --> 00:18:00,434
Hey. That's her. That's her.

465
00:18:00,436 --> 00:18:02,002
Mr. Forrester.

466
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:07,862
Uh, Natalie's out of surgery.

467
00:18:08,477 --> 00:18:12,413
But the damage to her heart
was very severe.

468
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:14,915
And we had some trouble
getting her off the pump.

469
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,217
I'm so sorry,

470
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:18,819
but there is only a slim chance

471
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:21,121
that Natalie will wake up again.

472
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:25,492
Look, uh, take a few minutes
to talk to your son,

473
00:18:25,494 --> 00:18:28,929
and, um, we'll, we'll
take you to see her.

474
00:18:28,931 --> 00:18:30,130
Dad.

475
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:31,699
Max.

476
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:33,133
I-Is Mom okay?

477
00:18:33,135 --> 00:18:34,847
Uh, she's, uh,

478
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:37,516
Mom is, uh...

479
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:45,179
Max... your mom was really badly hurt.

480
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:46,680
And we did everything we could to help,

481
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:48,402
And it's gonna be all right.

482
00:18:49,318 --> 00:18:51,919
She's gonna be all right.

483
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:53,253
Right?

484
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,698
I mean, dating's not that bad.

485
00:19:04,723 --> 00:19:06,214
I like talking to people...

486
00:19:06,216 --> 00:19:07,657
till you hit the One Thing.

487
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,763
What's the One Thing?

488
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:11,899
Date's going great, right?

489
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,802
She's smart, you're funny,
you're, you're hitting it off.

490
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:16,868
And then she says the One Thing,

491
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,204
right, the one, uh,
slightly racist thing.

492
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:20,839
- Oh, oh.
- Right? Or she, uh,

493
00:19:20,841 --> 00:19:22,140
she tears down her co-workers

494
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:24,276
or uses the wrong word for gay people

495
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:27,779
or misuses "their," "they're,"
and "there" in a text.

496
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:29,247
- That's unforgivable.
- Totally.

497
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:31,850
I mean, the One Thing ends the date,

498
00:19:31,852 --> 00:19:33,652
even if you're stuck there
for another hour.

499
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:35,420
This is why I don't date.

500
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:37,355
I imagine you're also kind of
married to work.

501
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:39,057
I have been accused of that, yeah.

502
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,126
No, wait. W-Why is that an accusation?

503
00:19:41,128 --> 00:19:43,795
It takes a ton of focus for
someone to get where you are,

504
00:19:43,797 --> 00:19:45,096
as young as you are.

505
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:46,565
Some people don't like their partner

506
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:48,066
to be as committed to their work

507
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:50,302
as they are to their relationship.
I just don't get it.

508
00:19:50,304 --> 00:19:51,603
Is that why you're single?

509
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:53,738
Yeah. My wife couldn't share.

510
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,140
You?

511
00:19:55,142 --> 00:19:57,609
Mm, he could share, but he died.

512
00:19:58,578 --> 00:20:00,599
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

513
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:02,948
Yeah.

514
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,250
Work's a very forgiving partner,
but it doesn't really,

515
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:07,552
Throw you up against the wall
and kiss you.

516
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:10,055
I was gonna say scratch your
back, but I like yours, too.

517
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:16,695
Actually, if you don't mind,
I'm just going to,

518
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:19,631
uh, call work and move some
things around this afternoon.

519
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:20,932
- Yeah, sure. Okay.
- Okay.

520
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:30,141
- Oh, God.
- What?

521
00:20:30,143 --> 00:20:33,411
This is, um, I'm sorry
to have to tell you this.

522
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:36,314
I-I thought you didn't
look like your picture,

523
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:38,917
and it's because it's, um,

524
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:40,619
it's her picture.

525
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:45,023
Yeah. I'm supposed to be
on a date with her.

526
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:47,425
- Are you Jon?
- Yeah. I am.

527
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:49,227
But it's a pretty common name.

528
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:50,795
Do you want to go over there?

529
00:20:50,797 --> 00:20:53,465
I don't. I'm enjoying this.

530
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:55,500
Well, she looks like

531
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:57,669
she's having a good time over there.

532
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:01,940
So... do you think that's my Jon?

533
00:21:07,413 --> 00:21:09,114
You call his mother, you break HIPAA.

534
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:10,949
You break HIPAA, we get sued.

535
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:13,752
So, what do I do?

536
00:21:13,754 --> 00:21:15,920
You know, Karev, the only thing less fun

537
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:17,122
than watching you do this job

538
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:18,590
is doing it for you.

539
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:19,858
Look, this isn't a chief thing.

540
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,126
This,
- I-It, It is.

541
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:22,527
I mean, being chief is...

542
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:24,396
nothing but being backed into corners.

543
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:26,609
The trick is finding
creative ways to get out.

544
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:29,267
Well, then I've found one.
I'm telling Bailey I quit.

545
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:30,835
- You can have this stupid job.
- No.

546
00:21:30,837 --> 00:21:32,103
No, you have been pissy about this

547
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:33,238
since the day I started.

548
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,373
I mean you are not allowed to quit, okay?

549
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,008
You may only quit after you've done it

550
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,911
to the best of your ability
and decided to, okay?

551
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:42,380
Otherwise, it's not quitting.
It's failing.

552
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:44,703
Now, my mother told me that,
and it's true.

553
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:46,951
So, what were you quitting, med school?

554
00:21:46,953 --> 00:21:49,521
I didn't want to play tetherball.
I was 10.

555
00:21:49,523 --> 00:21:50,689
This isn't tetherball.

556
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:52,457
Oh, it's all tetherball, Karev.

557
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:53,858
Look, kick its ass

558
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,794
and then decide you don't want it.

559
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:57,657
Don't let it decide it doesn't want you.

560
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,031
I, Aah!

561
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:06,204
- Ah.
- We get our doc checks

562
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:08,139
from the chief of surgery?

563
00:22:08,141 --> 00:22:10,041
Is that the best use of resources?

564
00:22:10,043 --> 00:22:11,710
I'm on sabbatical.

565
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,618
You look good. Miller, sit.

566
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,946
The right finger.

567
00:22:14,948 --> 00:22:17,649
He was hoping for Dr. Pierce.

568
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:19,718
Open.

569
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,786
- Ah.
- Um, do you, do you know,

570
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:24,022
do you know if she's single, Dr. Pierce?

571
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:25,523
Do I look like your auntie, Miller?

572
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:28,030
All right, you're all checked out.

573
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:31,830
Uh, hey, question,

574
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:34,065
who was first into this apartment fire?

575
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:35,867
- It was... Warren and Hughes.
- War... Warren.

576
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:38,636
- Why?
- Was that the best use of resources?

577
00:22:38,638 --> 00:22:42,173
I mean, he's the only surgeon
on a team of firefighters.

578
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:44,375
Don't you want to protect those hands?

579
00:22:47,747 --> 00:22:50,715
"So sorry. I would never want
to stand you up."

580
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:52,117
"Something has come up."

581
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:56,287
"Something unavoidable has come up,

582
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:59,624
and I can't make it there."

583
00:22:59,626 --> 00:23:01,426
That look good?

584
00:23:01,428 --> 00:23:03,461
Yep. But just change the "there"

585
00:23:03,463 --> 00:23:05,230
to the wrong "their",
that'll soften the blow.

586
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:07,132
Oh, that is good.

587
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:08,833
- Okay? One, two, three.
- Yep.

588
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:18,042
And just like that,
we're yesterday's news.

589
00:23:18,044 --> 00:23:20,345
Maybe they're falling in love.

590
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:22,514
Maybe this is meant to be.

591
00:23:22,516 --> 00:23:23,615
Good luck to them.

592
00:23:23,617 --> 00:23:26,184
We should, uh, We should get out of here

593
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:28,186
- before they see us.
- Okay.

594
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:33,091
Just,
- Be cool.

595
00:23:33,093 --> 00:23:34,626
- Yeah, just be cool, will you?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

596
00:23:34,628 --> 00:23:36,027
- You're just freaking out right now.
- Okay.

597
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:37,328
You're drawing a lot of attention to us.

598
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,496
Go. Go. Go.

599
00:23:39,498 --> 00:23:41,466
It's not fair. When Leo is 15,

600
00:23:41,468 --> 00:23:43,635
you'll have had 14 years to get ready.

601
00:23:43,637 --> 00:23:45,470
Mm. If I get to keep him.

602
00:23:45,472 --> 00:23:47,305
Okay. I'm just saying,

603
00:23:47,307 --> 00:23:49,107
I don't know how
to discipline a teenager.

604
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:50,475
You were one.

605
00:23:50,477 --> 00:23:51,543
What did your mom do?

606
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:53,645
- Nothing.
- Wh...

607
00:23:53,647 --> 00:23:55,780
She ruled with an iron fist
over her first four kids,

608
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:58,149
but I was her kryptonite.

609
00:23:58,151 --> 00:24:01,019
I think once my father died
in front of me,

610
00:24:01,021 --> 00:24:03,454
she was afraid to upset me.

611
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:05,723
She just let me do whatever I wanted.

612
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:06,758
Oh, my mom was the opposite.

613
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,926
When my dad died,

614
00:24:07,928 --> 00:24:10,261
she became Mom, Dad,
judge, jury, and executioner

615
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:11,596
for me and Megan.

616
00:24:11,598 --> 00:24:13,031
Yeah.

617
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:15,733
Well... you turned out okay.

618
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:18,169
Eh. I hope so.

619
00:24:20,173 --> 00:24:23,575
You know, sometimes I think
parenting, it's just...

620
00:24:23,577 --> 00:24:25,743
Okay, fine.

621
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:31,783
Whoa. What?

622
00:24:32,852 --> 00:24:34,331
Hey.

623
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:37,388
Hey, Max, what are you doing down here?

624
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:41,860
Is my mom gonna be okay?

625
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:45,209
Max.

626
00:24:48,334 --> 00:24:51,306
Um, Max, the problem...

627
00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:54,226
that your mom has is a big one.

628
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,729
So, her heart, which pumps
all the blood through her body,

629
00:24:58,311 --> 00:24:59,844
is pretty badly damaged.

630
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,846
- It's, It's,
- There you are!

631
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:04,449
You can't go running off
like that, buddy, please.

632
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:06,184
She was telling me about Mom.

633
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:07,552
Is there a change?

634
00:25:07,554 --> 00:25:09,587
Can I speak to you for a sec?

635
00:25:10,522 --> 00:25:11,856
Look, I-I just went to the restroom,

636
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:14,759
and, and, and when
he's scared, he likes to hide.

637
00:25:14,761 --> 00:25:16,594
Yeah. Um...

638
00:25:16,596 --> 00:25:18,429
he probably gets that from you.

639
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:20,363
I'm sorry?

640
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:22,588
Look, I know you're
trying to protect Max,

641
00:25:23,003 --> 00:25:25,132
but he needs to know what's coming.

642
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:26,704
You don't know my kid.

643
00:25:26,706 --> 00:25:28,907
I know that any kid needs to be prepared

644
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:30,742
for what is going to happen
to his mother.

645
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:32,543
You said there's still a chance.

646
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:33,978
I said there was a slim chance.

647
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,517
That's still a chance!

648
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,562
Max, let's go, buddy.

649
00:25:39,653 --> 00:25:41,707
And I'm not gonna
take that away from him.

650
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:44,476
Please don't talk to my son.

651
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:48,026
<i>Dr. Hoffman to Oncology.</i>

652
00:25:48,028 --> 00:25:50,361
<i>Dr. Hoffman to Oncology.</i>

653
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,397
What happened?

654
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:53,731
He's trying to leave.

655
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:54,966
He got winded putting on his pants.

656
00:25:54,968 --> 00:25:56,901
It's because
your lungs aren't working right.

657
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:58,670
Come on, pal.

658
00:25:58,672 --> 00:26:00,738
His pulse ox was just 88 on room air.

659
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,907
Look, Julius, you
still haven't recovered fully

660
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,409
from the smoke inhalation.

661
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:07,045
And this bleb, it, it,
it could burst out there,

662
00:26:07,047 --> 00:26:09,514
in the middle of chem class,
when I'm not there to help you.

663
00:26:09,516 --> 00:26:10,715
The insurance,

664
00:26:10,717 --> 00:26:12,550
it was really c-clear.

665
00:26:12,552 --> 00:26:14,352
This was pre-exi... existing.

666
00:26:14,354 --> 00:26:16,120
I-I can't afford this.

667
00:26:16,122 --> 00:26:17,288
I got to go.

668
00:26:20,727 --> 00:26:23,528
Okay, uh, just, uh, um, lie back.

669
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,662
Let me check you before you leave.

670
00:26:24,664 --> 00:26:27,365
Wait. Le... H-He's just gonna leave AMA?

671
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,834
Yeah. He's allowed to refuse care.

672
00:26:29,836 --> 00:26:32,704
Legally, we can't force you
to have treatment.

673
00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:36,874
What is this?

674
00:26:38,979 --> 00:26:40,011
W-What did you do?

675
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:42,080
He has a penetrating chest wound.

676
00:26:42,082 --> 00:26:43,548
I mean, how did we miss this?

677
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,850
- I didn't.
- Well, I mean, it's right there.

678
00:26:45,852 --> 00:26:47,785
I mean, this could be
invading the pleural space.

679
00:26:47,787 --> 00:26:49,487
We got to take a look in surgery.

680
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:51,289
No, I-I can't have surgery.

681
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,725
Dude, listen, it's an emergency surgery,

682
00:26:53,727 --> 00:26:56,160
so it's covered under your insurance...

683
00:26:56,162 --> 00:26:58,809
and anything else that we find in there.

684
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:00,977
Do you understand?

685
00:27:01,568 --> 00:27:02,677
Yeah.

686
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:03,768
All right. Okay.

687
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,003
All right, Qadri, um,

688
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:07,405
send off pre-op labs and book an OR.

689
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:10,608
Dr. Karev...

690
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,410
I have to report this.

691
00:27:12,412 --> 00:27:14,112
Well, you just told the chief.

692
00:27:21,513 --> 00:27:23,546
Mom? Mom, are you okay? What do you need?

693
00:27:23,548 --> 00:27:25,148
Nothing. I'm not here to see you.

694
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,150
I have a life, Owen. Good Lord.

695
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:30,120
No. We're going, Miller.

696
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:31,821
We, We've hung around long enough.

697
00:27:31,823 --> 00:27:33,890
But we should tell Dr. Pierce
we're leaving, though, right?

698
00:27:33,892 --> 00:27:34,824
You know, close the circle.

699
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:36,693
Hey, Dr. Pierce.

700
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:38,395
- Hey.
- Hey.

701
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:43,066
Uh, Dean. Miller. Dean.

702
00:27:43,068 --> 00:27:44,934
Ah.

703
00:27:44,936 --> 00:27:48,304
- What's up?
- Uh... I was wondering

704
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:50,540
how that lady was doing,

705
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:52,075
the, that poor kid's mom.

706
00:27:52,077 --> 00:27:54,544
- Oh. Yeah, not good.
- Mnh.

707
00:27:54,546 --> 00:27:56,312
There was too much damage to repair.

708
00:27:56,314 --> 00:27:58,682
Wow. That's... too bad.

709
00:27:58,684 --> 00:27:59,849
Yeah.

710
00:28:05,691 --> 00:28:07,857
- Was there something else?
- Uh, yes, yes.

711
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:11,594
Um, just trying to pivot from that.

712
00:28:11,596 --> 00:28:13,863
I kind of set myself up badly.

713
00:28:13,865 --> 00:28:15,598
- For?
- I was, I was, I was wondering

714
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,804
if you would like to
get dinner with me sometime.

715
00:28:18,804 --> 00:28:20,036
Oh.

716
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:21,071
Oh!

717
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:25,875
Um... well, Dean...

718
00:28:25,877 --> 00:28:27,077
Don't have to laugh.

719
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:29,412
No, no, I just,

720
00:28:29,414 --> 00:28:33,783
I, uh, I had a fiancé named Dean once.

721
00:28:33,785 --> 00:28:36,086
This is, This is going great.

722
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:37,587
Dr. Pierce...

723
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:38,788
Natalie Forrester coded again.

724
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,557
We brought her back,
but she's circling the drain.

725
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,392
I have to go.

726
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:48,331
I am so glad we waited.

727
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:50,934
So glad.

728
00:28:50,936 --> 00:28:52,402
What the hell, Karev?

729
00:28:52,404 --> 00:28:54,070
Oh, Qadri reported me?

730
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:57,073
She did her job. You stabbed a patient?

731
00:28:57,075 --> 00:29:00,643
Look, you said
find a creative solution, right?

732
00:29:00,645 --> 00:29:03,947
I didn't say commit assault
or insurance fraud.

733
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:06,216
I mean, if this is your way of
getting out of being interim chief,

734
00:29:06,218 --> 00:29:07,383
congratulations.

735
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:09,119
It'll likely get you
out of being a doctor at all.

736
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:10,520
Look, I'm just kicking the job's ass

737
00:29:10,522 --> 00:29:12,655
before it kicks mine,
like your mother said.

738
00:29:12,657 --> 00:29:15,625
No, no. You do not get to use
my mother's words against me.

739
00:29:15,627 --> 00:29:18,495
Well, let me tell you something
my mother used to say,

740
00:29:18,497 --> 00:29:20,897
"Bats! There are bats everywhere, Alex,

741
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:23,032
and they know everybody's phone numbers."

742
00:29:23,034 --> 00:29:24,834
So, how about you let me borrow
your mom for a minute?

743
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,744
Of course it was the right thing.

744
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,535
You drug-test her, and you ground her.

745
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,371
What's the problem?

746
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:35,438
Well, I just have no authority.

747
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,907
I-I'm not her mother or,

748
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,708
- What are you?
- I don't know.

749
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,245
Her friend? Or her sponsor maybe?

750
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,914
I-I'm trying to be whatever she needs.

751
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:46,483
She needs a damn mother, sounds like.

752
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:47,751
So, I should push it?

753
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,437
You're building a boat.

754
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,554
A boat?

755
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,924
It's what I used to tell Owen's dad.

756
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:55,725
They're gonna sail away from us, I said.

757
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,127
It's inevitable.

758
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,497
Our job is to build a boat strong enough

759
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,465
that, when they decide to,

760
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,786
they can get back to us safely.

761
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,304
Right.

762
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:12,876
So, I need to be firm, use tough wood,

763
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,077
and hammer in the nails with,

764
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,513
You're not building an actual boat.

765
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,915
The boat is your relationship with,

766
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,517
Right. No. I-I got it.

767
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,085
Thank you.

768
00:30:23,854 --> 00:30:25,557
Let me ask you this.

769
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,024
Are you and Owen back together?

770
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,437
I can't tell, and he won't say.

771
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,495
Uh, I don't know.

772
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,630
I think we're just kind of,

773
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:36,499
Raising some kids together or whatever?

774
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:39,602
Lord.

775
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,038
Do you have an opinion either way?

776
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,783
Of course I do, dear.

777
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,076
I'm his mother.

778
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:56,586
Mr. Forrester.

779
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,121
Is she awake?

780
00:30:58,123 --> 00:30:59,299
Uh...

781
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,926
We think that it's time.

782
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,327
Time for what?

783
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,864
Max, son, I'm, I'm gonna
go check on Mommy, okay?

784
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,232
Okay.

785
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,105
This could be his last chance
to say goodbye.

786
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,650
Please don't.

787
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,110
This is too much for him.

788
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,711
I mean, Max shouldn't even be here.

789
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,614
Look, I can take him to get
something to eat, if you like.

790
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,116
- Would you mind?
- Yeah.

791
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,120
Okay.

792
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,626
Hey, Max.

793
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:39,229
You hungry? No?

794
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:42,899
Do you want to see something cool?

795
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,435
I haven't left the country in a while.

796
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,037
Traveled to Europe after med school,

797
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,906
but I really need to go to Switzerland.

798
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,441
Yeah, getting to travel's the best thing

799
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,309
about being married to work.

800
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,611
It's the trade-off for all the sex

801
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:55,845
that work doesn't give you.

802
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,148
Do you travel a lot?

803
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,883
Um, no, but I can.

804
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,217
I got the time and the resources

805
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,752
to do whatever.

806
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,422
And there's no kids to worry about, so...

807
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,891
- Ah. Actually,
- You know, truly, that,

808
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:11,694
that is the most frustrating
thing about dating,

809
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,396
the single moms.

810
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,998
There's such a need to speed things up.

811
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,232
It's like, by the end of the first date,

812
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,001
they're talking marriage.

813
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:20,403
Kids can make women so...

814
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,538
Desperate?

815
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,508
Well, I don't want to call it that.

816
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,909
Yeah. You know what?
I <i>do</i> want to call it that.

817
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,912
What? What's wrong?

818
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,981
You have a kid.

819
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,383
I have three.

820
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:36,586
And while I don't feel like
I'm on any sort of clock,

821
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,354
I also don't feel like

822
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:39,856
they're holding me back from anything.

823
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:41,858
Yeah. I'm, I'm sorry.
I really didn't mean...

824
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,319
I know.

825
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,163
I said the One Thing, didn't I?

826
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,231
But this was fun.

827
00:32:51,914 --> 00:32:53,069
Take care.

828
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:12,474
Whoa.

829
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,658
Are we even allowed to be up here?

830
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,194
Uh, not really, but, uh,

831
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,330
that's part of what makes it cool, right?

832
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,933
Why don't you come have a seat, pal?

833
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:32,994
I know she's not okay.

834
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,663
I can tell.

835
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:39,315
Why is my dad lying to me?

836
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,617
I wouldn't say he's lying, Max.

837
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,378
He's just trying to...

838
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,121
Look, when I was in college,

839
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,757
my mom went to go visit
my sister in Italy.

840
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,260
And one day, my sister calls me,
and she says,

841
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:52,680
"You have to come home right now.
Mom's really sick."

842
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:56,643
So, I flew home, and when I got there...

843
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,189
she had died of a stroke.

844
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,973
But the truth is, she was already dead

845
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,075
before my sister even called me.

846
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,211
- Your sister lied?
- Mm-hmm.

847
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,079
Yeah. She did.

848
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,982
And believe me, Max, I was so mad at her.

849
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,453
But then she said,

850
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,208
"I couldn't have you find out
without me being there to hug you."

851
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:23,459
- And then I understood.
- So, my dad <i>is</i> lying?

852
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,395
- No.
- Is my mom gonna die?

853
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,663
No, Max, I just mean,

854
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,464
- Is she dead already?
- Max, no.

855
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:31,134
I just mean it's hard
to face the truth sometimes.

856
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:32,735
It's scary, even for doctors.

857
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,037
W... Max.

858
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,104
Max, wait!

859
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,040
Hey. Max!

860
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,041
Max, wait!

861
00:34:44,944 --> 00:34:47,144
Dr. Grey. You look nice.

862
00:34:47,146 --> 00:34:48,309
Thanks. I had a meeting.

863
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:50,358
Hey! How was your date?

864
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:52,057
Oh. Oh, that kind of meeting.

865
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:52,925
Oh, let's not.

866
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:54,226
- Please, let's do.
- Yeah.

867
00:34:55,229 --> 00:34:57,662
- I hate people.
- Oh, thank God.

868
00:34:58,466 --> 00:34:59,965
This man's wife is dying,

869
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:02,134
and he's not gonna tell his kid
until after she's already dead,

870
00:35:02,136 --> 00:35:04,669
when it's too late
for him to say goodbye.

871
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,307
- You.
- Me?

872
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:10,276
Yeah, you should answer this for me.

873
00:35:10,278 --> 00:35:12,311
If you see a disaster coming

874
00:35:12,313 --> 00:35:15,147
and you have to break
patient confidentiality

875
00:35:15,149 --> 00:35:16,582
to prevent it,

876
00:35:16,584 --> 00:35:17,983
don't you do that?

877
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:22,087
Like, I-I should tell you,
right, uh, them, him?

878
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:23,689
Well, it's an oath.

879
00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:27,066
And as wrong as it feels,
is it your business?

880
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:29,495
I hate people.

881
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:32,739
So, how did it go?

882
00:35:33,401 --> 00:35:35,201
Horribly.

883
00:35:35,203 --> 00:35:38,370
I liked him a lot.
We found each other delightful.

884
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:40,940
And I thought, "Hey,
could it really be this easy?

885
00:35:40,942 --> 00:35:42,241
How is that horrible?

886
00:35:42,243 --> 00:35:44,009
Because then he said the One Thing,

887
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:45,077
that he hates kids

888
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,179
and that he finds
single mothers desperate.

889
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:49,648
Right. Okay. Next time!

890
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,617
Right. I don't think
there'll be a next time.

891
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:53,801
Don't! Don't give up!

892
00:35:54,222 --> 00:35:57,056
For what it's worth, it,
it sounds like a great date.

893
00:35:57,058 --> 00:35:59,058
I mean, if he hadn't said that thing,

894
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,426
you might have given it a go,

895
00:36:00,428 --> 00:36:02,895
and then he would have probably
tried to hide his feelings

896
00:36:02,897 --> 00:36:05,831
and the truth might not come out
for months or years.

897
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:09,068
So, I mean, you found out
there are good men out there,

898
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,804
and you dodged a very slow-moving bullet.

899
00:36:11,806 --> 00:36:14,947
I'd call that a good use of your time.

900
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:17,241
Thanks, Herrera.

901
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:20,012
<i>Dr. Mahoney to the ER.</i>

902
00:36:20,014 --> 00:36:21,413
<i>Dr. Mahoney to the ER.</i>

903
00:36:22,585 --> 00:36:23,682
Hey.

904
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:25,050
Hey.

905
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:26,519
Have you seen a kid, 10 years old?

906
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:28,354
You've lost a child, Andrea?

907
00:36:28,356 --> 00:36:30,366
I didn't lose a child.
I'm looking for one.

908
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:32,892
- Okay.
- Oh, uh, did you hear from Papa?

909
00:36:32,894 --> 00:36:34,927
It's, uh, Just go.

910
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:36,061
Go find your kid, yeah?

911
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:37,329
- All right. Okay.
- Yeah.

912
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:38,764
Oh, oh, uh, Carina?

913
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,165
What?

914
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:41,700
You're a really good sister.

915
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:46,505
Max.

916
00:36:47,507 --> 00:36:48,507
Max?

917
00:36:53,981 --> 00:36:56,382
Bye-bye, bleb.

918
00:36:56,384 --> 00:36:58,317
Now he'll breathe without a problem,

919
00:36:58,319 --> 00:36:59,518
and he doesn't have to worry

920
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,787
about the thing bursting on its own.

921
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:04,657
Well, I understand the medicine, Karev.

922
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:05,858
What I'm not so sure of

923
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,526
is how you plan to tell his mother

924
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:10,262
and a medical ethics committee.

925
00:37:10,264 --> 00:37:13,132
I'll probably tell them about
the time that I stole a car.

926
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:18,203
One night, my baby sister, Amber,

927
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:19,438
had the flu.

928
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,408
She spiked a fever of 104.

929
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,311
I was 12, home alone,
didn't know what to do.

930
00:37:25,313 --> 00:37:28,047
So I broke into the neighbor's house,

931
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:30,883
stole the car keys,
and took her to the hospital,

932
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:33,018
where there were people
who <i>would</i> know what to do.

933
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,620
Why didn't you just call an ambulance?

934
00:37:34,622 --> 00:37:37,155
You know how much
an ambulance ride costs?

935
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:40,259
I think I'll get a pass from his mom.

936
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:43,452
And I'm hoping there's no need
to face an ethics committee.

937
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:45,798
3-0 Vicryl?

938
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:51,003
- Can't you drive me home?
- Amelia's gonna do it.

939
00:37:51,005 --> 00:37:52,471
How do you even deal with her?

940
00:37:52,473 --> 00:37:54,630
Well, for one thing, I don't lie to her.

941
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,300
And, also, I accept her.

942
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:00,579
I accept that
she will be a little intense,

943
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:02,448
a little too much sometimes

944
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,390
because she cares so much.

945
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:07,453
She's trying to help you,
and if you let her,

946
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:09,989
she might stop driving you so crazy.

947
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:15,794
Did you take the drug test?

948
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:16,996
No.

949
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:20,265
Well, uh, I will show you
where the bathroom is.

950
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:21,533
I smoked some weed.

951
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:24,336
Me and a friend.

952
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:26,205
It wasn't heroin. It wasn't pills.

953
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:27,840
It was just weed.

954
00:38:27,842 --> 00:38:31,410
There's no "just weed," okay?

955
00:38:31,412 --> 00:38:35,381
Because when a junkie
smokes weed or drinks,

956
00:38:35,383 --> 00:38:38,017
we sometimes forget to not do heroin.

957
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:40,152
It triggers cravings, all of it, Betty.

958
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:41,253
And you've been to plenty of meetings,

959
00:38:41,255 --> 00:38:43,179
so I think you know that already.

960
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:45,424
Okay?

961
00:38:45,426 --> 00:38:48,761
So... you're grounded.

962
00:38:48,763 --> 00:38:51,897
One month, no friends,
no hanging out after school.

963
00:38:51,899 --> 00:38:53,032
Wait. One <i>month?</i>

964
00:38:53,034 --> 00:38:54,099
Are you crazy?

965
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:55,434
- Amelia,
- Shh! I am building a boat.

966
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:57,236
One month, you go to school,

967
00:38:57,238 --> 00:38:58,804
you come home and go to meetings.

968
00:38:58,806 --> 00:39:00,639
That is it. Then we'll talk.

969
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:02,574
Oh, my God. Okay, yeah, whatever.

970
00:39:02,576 --> 00:39:05,210
You are so lame. You are both so lame.

971
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:06,912
I'll be in the car.

972
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:11,784
- We are lame.
- We're so lame.

973
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:18,023
Hi, Julius. Surgery went well.

974
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:19,925
We removed the bleb with no problem,

975
00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:22,461
and you have two very healthy lungs.

976
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:24,296
You stab people?

977
00:39:24,298 --> 00:39:26,732
To, To give them surgery?

978
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:28,701
<i>My mother said, "Tell the truth."</i>

979
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:31,637
You needed the surgery,
and you needed it covered.

980
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,505
My mom's gonna go crazy.

981
00:39:36,377 --> 00:39:39,244
No. Crazy happy.

982
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:41,547
She's been saving for this,
like, forever.

983
00:39:42,983 --> 00:39:45,350
<i>"Just tell the best version
of the truth you can."</i>

984
00:39:45,352 --> 00:39:47,352
Hey, won't you get fired for this?

985
00:39:47,354 --> 00:39:50,389
Oh, probably not. I'm the chief.

986
00:39:57,198 --> 00:39:58,197
I'm sorry.

987
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,364
For calling me a hooker?

988
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:00,599
I never called you a...

989
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:01,767
You suggested I'd trade sex

990
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:03,435
for a multimillion-dollar MRI machine,

991
00:40:03,437 --> 00:40:05,904
which makes me a pretty
high-class hooker, actually.

992
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:07,106
Tell him to watch the wound,

993
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:08,240
and if there's any increase in redness,

994
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:09,441
I want to see him back here, cool?

995
00:40:09,443 --> 00:40:10,876
Is that...

996
00:40:10,878 --> 00:40:13,545
- That's Link. He's the new,
- Atticus Lincoln?!

997
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:14,780
Brooke?!

998
00:40:14,782 --> 00:40:16,014
Link?!

999
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:16,949
What?!

1000
00:40:16,951 --> 00:40:18,150
Ahh!

1001
00:40:18,152 --> 00:40:20,018
Oh, my gosh!

1002
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,054
Ahh! You work here?!

1003
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:24,556
- I work here!
- No way!

1004
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:26,625
<i>Because the truth
is gonna come out sometime.</i>

1005
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:34,623
He saying his goodbyes?

1006
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,570
His kid still doesn't even know
what's coming.

1007
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:40,839
Keep me posted.

1008
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:44,133
Hey.

1009
00:40:45,012 --> 00:40:46,761
I should have told him.

1010
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:51,316
I had the chance to tell him,
and I should have.

1011
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:53,318
Nobody wants a surprise like that.

1012
00:40:54,655 --> 00:40:56,088
You deserve a heads-up.

1013
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:59,356
"Surprise. Your mother's gone."

1014
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:03,729
"Surprise. Your boyfriend
went to go be with the trees."

1015
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:05,130
"Surprise, Amelia."

1016
00:41:08,002 --> 00:41:09,868
"Surprise, Amelia," what?

1017
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,104
<i>And the one thing
you can't do with the truth</i>

1018
00:41:12,106 --> 00:41:13,705
<i>is hide from it...</i>

1019
00:41:13,707 --> 00:41:16,208
Teddy Altman is pregnant.

1020
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,750
It's Owen's baby.

1021
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:20,813
Owen doesn't know, Amelia doesn't know,

1022
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:23,048
and I just broke
doctor/patient confidentiality

1023
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,548
by telling you.

1024
00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:28,453
Max!

1025
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:30,455
Have you guys seen Max?

1026
00:41:30,457 --> 00:41:31,990
No. I thought he was with you.

1027
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:34,927
I lost him, okay? I-I lost Max.

1028
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:37,262
He ran away,
and I can't find him anywhere.

1029
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:39,031
Max!

1030
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:40,599
<i>...because the truth
is gonna come looking...</i>

1031
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:47,806
<i>...until it finds you.</i>

1031
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:54,297

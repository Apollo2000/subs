1
00:00:11,758 --> 00:00:13,588
- You're late.
- I know.

2
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:15,256
- She's worried.
- Well, I'm here now.

3
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:22,731
<i>In trauma, we're concerned
with one overriding question...</i>

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,600
<i>how did this happen?</i>

5
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:28,269
- I didn't want you to see me yet.
- I know.

6
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,740
Tatiana, you look...

7
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:33,508
so beautiful.

8
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,844
<i>What was</i>
<i>the mechanism of injury?</i>

9
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:39,080
<i>How do we see past the mess</i>
<i>and confusion of the trauma</i>

10
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,683
<i>to figure out</i>
<i>what the damage actually is?</i>

11
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:44,018
Infinite possibilities

12
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:46,955
put the patient
on the table in front of you.

13
00:00:46,956 --> 00:00:51,693
Now you have to figure out...
will they live?

14
00:00:51,694 --> 00:00:54,529
Will you be able to save them?

15
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:57,665
Or are they a lost cause?

16
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,135
No shared assets, no children,

17
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:03,671
and, of course, there's a solid
post-nuptial agreement in place.

18
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:07,609
With nothing to contest, it's
just about signing the papers.

19
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:11,679
The places to initial and sign
are all clearly marked.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,716
Red tabs for initials,
blue tabs for signatures.

21
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:18,319
<i>Every part of a trauma tells</i>
<i>a different piece of the story.</i>

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,122
This is one of the simpler
divorces I've seen, actually.

23
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,425
<i>And until you look</i>
<i>at each and every injury...</i>

24
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:29,397
So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna sign the papers?

25
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:31,132
We have to push,
and we have to fight.

26
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,568
I'm not sure
we <i>are</i> worth fighting for.

27
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,838
<i>...you can't see what went wrong.</i>

28
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:37,705
At work?

29
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:39,674
That's where you decide to do this?!

30
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:41,576
You want to lower your voice?

31
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:42,710
What does it matter
how loud my voice is

32
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:46,047
when 35 people just saw me
get served with divorce papers

33
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:47,916
in the middle
of the emergency room?!

34
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,684
I am sorry about that, all right?

35
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:51,519
That was not supposed to happen.

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,321
He was supposed to talk to you
after you were done with work.

37
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,557
It's only been four weeks.
Four, Jackson.

38
00:01:55,558 --> 00:01:58,092
Is that... that's all the counseling
you could handle before bailing?

39
00:01:58,093 --> 00:01:59,928
You said you wanted to try!

40
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:01,396
We <i>did</i> try.

41
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:03,031
It didn't work.
It didn't get us anywhere.

42
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:06,234
We have the same exact fight
over and over again, around in circles.

43
00:02:06,235 --> 00:02:07,936
I'm telling you... it's not working.

44
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:10,438
Then why are we even bothering
with counseling?!

45
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,373
What is the point of counseling

46
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:15,043
if you're just gonna suddenly,
without even talking, just...

47
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:17,212
Oh, come on.
All we do is talk, April.

48
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:18,880
So, what? You just...
you just serve me papers?

49
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:19,981
Just like that?

50
00:02:19,982 --> 00:02:24,052
Do you have any idea
what a slap in the face this is?

51
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:30,625
How long?!

52
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:32,794
How long
have I been sitting on a couch

53
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:35,096
discussing my marriage with someone
who has already checked out?

54
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:37,632
- That's not what I was doing.
- I just want to know when it happened.

55
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:40,768
When did you decide
that you were done?

56
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,137
- She didn't say that.
- Yeah, she did.

57
00:02:43,138 --> 00:02:44,739
When did she say that?

58
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,274
She's been saying it
for three weeks now.

59
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:48,042
We shouldn't be having sex.

60
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,545
I hardly think our sex life is our problem.

61
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,073
I don't think it's a problem.
It just... it gets in the way.

62
00:02:52,074 --> 00:02:53,748
In the way of what?

63
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:55,617
You're just hearing
what you want to hear.

64
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:58,253
I'm hearing what our therapist
is telling us, and you're not.

65
00:02:58,254 --> 00:03:01,322
It's like we're sitting in on two
completely different sessions.

66
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:02,757
That's just offensive.

67
00:03:02,758 --> 00:03:04,559
What's offensive is you keep
choosing to ignore...

68
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,094
I'm not ignoring anything!

69
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:08,796
See? You can't ever take responsibility.
You never apologize for anything.

70
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:12,133
I apologize all the time.

71
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:13,001
Not for the things that matter.

72
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:14,669
What do I have
to apologize for, Jackson?

73
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,471
I am here, and I'm trying.

74
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:17,845
I want to make this work.

75
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:20,808
Stop! Will you just... don't touch it.

76
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:24,178
Sorry.

77
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:33,588
Now, remember,
once we remove these bandages,

78
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,257
there's gonna be some...
some redness, some swelling.

79
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,861
So... Did you talk to April last night?

80
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:41,195
I did.

81
00:03:41,196 --> 00:03:43,298
And? How'd it go?

82
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:46,000
Not, uh... not exactly as I expected.

83
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,002
Oh, God. She took it that hard?

84
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:51,940
Or she didn't because...

85
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,107
You didn't ask her, did you?

86
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,375
- Tatiana.
- You're kidding me.

87
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:55,410
- It's really not that simple.
- Sure, it is.

88
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:57,645
You just say, "This isn't
working for me anymore."

89
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:59,647
I'm not happy. I want a divorce."

90
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:01,182
Knock, knock! Hey.

91
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:03,818
Oh. Well, you ready for the unveiling?

92
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,520
Four years' hard work, Avery.

93
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:07,622
Well, I'm just the surgeon.
Tatiana's had the hardest job.

94
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,991
This guy. Always sweet-talking.

95
00:04:09,992 --> 00:04:11,893
43 surgeries, 4 years,

96
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:15,396
3 months, 1 week, and 4 days.

97
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:18,399
Can't believe this is the last time
you'll be unwrapping my face.

98
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:22,337
Okay.

99
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:24,739
Let's do it.

100
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:29,210
Wait. I'm...

101
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:30,912
I don't think I'll be able to look.

102
00:04:30,913 --> 00:04:32,914
Hey, what kind of hack
do you think I am?

103
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:34,816
You are going to want to see this.

104
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,351
Trust me.

105
00:04:41,423 --> 00:04:42,557
How's Meredith?

106
00:04:42,558 --> 00:04:46,527
She's good, considering
it's her first week of recovery.

107
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:48,663
Good.

108
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,431
What are you up to?

109
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:51,432
You're just...

110
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:53,568
- Mm-hmm?
- You're so...

111
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:56,237
Remember how our therapist said
that we should be more direct

112
00:04:56,238 --> 00:04:58,840
- with what we want?
- Oh.

113
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,842
Maybe you should be more direct
with what you want.

114
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:05,113
I have an hour until my I&D case.

115
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:07,582
I'm heading to the on-call room...

116
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,783
Take a little nap.

117
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:10,351
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

118
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,353
Too bad
you won't be getting any sleep.

119
00:05:19,962 --> 00:05:21,896
I don't want to talk,
because you know what?

120
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:23,197
I know what you're gonna say!

121
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,766
You're gonna say
"You love me, but"!

122
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,634
You don't know
what I'm going to say!

123
00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:28,084
- Oh, I'm pretty sure I do.
- It doesn't matter! You don't!

124
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:31,406
Fine! Fine. Then just go ahead.

125
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:32,807
- Come...
- Say it.

126
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,910
Oh, my God, Jackson!

127
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:39,180
God! Please!
Would you just say it?!

128
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:44,052
You're right. I was.

129
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:45,887
I was gonna ask you for a divorce

130
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,088
when we went for dinner,

131
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:48,923
and then again when we stayed
in for dinner...

132
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:50,091
and then things happened.

133
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:52,326
Yeah, well, we had sex, Jackson.
That's what happened. We had sex.

134
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:55,496
I was clear about this.
My mind was made up.

135
00:05:55,497 --> 00:05:58,132
I knew what was best for me...
moving forward,

136
00:05:58,133 --> 00:05:59,133
no matter how hard.

137
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:02,103
I knew there were things
that we couldn't repair.

138
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:03,471
I knew what I had to do.

139
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:05,807
And it's not clear for me anymore.

140
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:10,011
This... When I look at you
and I stop thinking...

141
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:14,449
When I let myself just be with you...

142
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,119
All I'm saying is, I don't think
that I want what I wanted anymore.

143
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,688
And what I want...

144
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:22,857
What?

145
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:27,795
I want you.

146
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:42,111

00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:48,527
You guys had sex.
Yeah, we did, too.

148
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:50,943
- It's messy.
- Stop running away from me.

149
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,245
Callie, you and Arizona,
before you guys split,

150
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,514
you did the counseling thing, right?

151
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,010
I mean, an hour wait for a table?

152
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,346
It's ridiculous. I'm hungry <i>now.</i>

153
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,349
- Oh.
- This was such a better idea.

154
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,551
Place looks nice.

155
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,686
Changed some things around, huh?

156
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,388
Some new pillows.

157
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,689
I like those.

158
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,391
No, you don't.
You hate throw pillows.

159
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,026
- I really do.
- Yeah, I know.

160
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,394
I'm sorry.
You want something to drink?

161
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,395
Yeah.

162
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,668
Oh, my God.
They gave us so many fortune cookies.

163
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,436
I love fortune cookies!

164
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,138
I know. I asked for extra.

165
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,176
I'm sorry again about
last night getting cut short.

166
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,112
I get it. It's okay. It's fine.

167
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,514
Yeah, I know.

168
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,454
And...

169
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,156
Look at that.

170
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,365
Amen.

171
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,802
Thank you for waiting.

172
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,604
Mm-hmm.

173
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,973
You want to know
what I was praying for?

174
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,142
No, that's all right.

175
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,077
Throw pillows.

176
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,646
Thousands of them
just raining from the sky.

177
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,349
- I do not understand their purpose.
- They have so many purposes.

178
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,475
- They don't.
- They're like a pop of color.

179
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:14,262
You, like, prop up
your arms and your feet.

180
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,655
- Plus, it looks nice.
- You're funny.

181
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,123
- It's good, right?
- It's really good.

182
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,392
- Told you you'd like this place.
- I can't believe I never noticed it.

183
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,928
I probably ordered takeout
every night while you were gone.

184
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,731
And I didn't realize this place
was right around the corner.

185
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,066
Wow. Okay.

186
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,668
- What?
- We just sat down to eat.

187
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,504
- I-I thought we were having a nice time.
- We are.

188
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,173
So why are you gonna ruin it
by picking a fight?

189
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,374
No, I'm not.

190
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,810
I wasn't picking a fight.
I was just talking Chinese food.

191
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,611
- And Jordan.
- And takeout.

192
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,346
I am not the one getting defensive.

193
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,248
- And <i>I</i> am?
- Look...

194
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,645
I did not come here to fight tonight.

195
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:48,197
- Okay.
- Okay?

196
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,589
Okay.

197
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,399
So, why <i>did</i> you come here?

198
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,872
Throw pillows, obviously.

199
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,478
I saw you had a, um,
nasal septum reconstruction

200
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,479
up on the board today.

201
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,514
- Is that for Tatiana?
- Uh, yeah. Her final surgery.

202
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,450
She's come such a long way.
You should be so proud.

203
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,585
I am.

204
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:23,856
I mean, I-I will be once it
all kind of comes together.

205
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:24,890
Mm-hmm.

206
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,559
I've performed so many
surgeries on her, you know,

207
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,662
that her face is
just this road map, you know,

208
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,999
of an incredible journey
that we've been on together.

209
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,769
I'm rambling. I'll stop.

210
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,409
We really should talk, though.

211
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,812
We <i>are</i> talking.

212
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,480
Yeah, I mean...

213
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,015
really talk.

214
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,150
About us.

215
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,485
Mm-hmm.

216
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,221
Obviously it's not easy, you know?

217
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,390
I do think it's right.

218
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,425
If you're struggling this much,
maybe that should tell you something.

219
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,594
Maybe you should stop
before you say whatever it is...

220
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,930
We need to talk about
getting a divorce.

221
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,269
April...

222
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,703
Okay.

223
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,240
Come on. Don't...

224
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,444
We're not even living together.

225
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,915
Okay, this is the first
substantial conversation

226
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,283
we've had in, what, months?

227
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,451
Well, that is <i>your</i> choice
and not mine,

228
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,419
'cause I've been here.

229
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,221
I've been willing
to have any conversation.

230
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,556
Don't do that.

231
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,791
- Don't blame me.
- I'm not blaming you.

232
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,693
It's not blame. It's just fact.

233
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,028
I want to talk to you,

234
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,262
but we're having
two different conversations

235
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,598
'cause I want to work on things
and you just want to end them.

236
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,300
I'm not being flip about any of this.

237
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,936
You actually believe
that I'm taking this lightly?

238
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,871
It just seems like
you are looking for an excuse

239
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,273
to walk away instead
of putting in any of the work...

240
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,576
You <i>left</i> me!

241
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,578
You walked away!

242
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,280
You... you ran halfway across
the world! How co...

243
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,916
'Cause I was dying, Jackson!

244
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,720
Samuel died, and I died!

245
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,557
Until Jordan, until I was
able go over there and...

246
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,593
And what?

247
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:11,230
You think I was somehow
just fine after Samuel?

248
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,232
You don't think I was dying, too?

249
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,167
No. No, okay?

250
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,269
You weren't. Not like me.

251
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,303
You were coping.

252
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,605
You... you were okay.

253
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,306
I couldn't even...

254
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,108
And then I found something.

255
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,678
I found something over there
that I needed so badly!

256
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,081
And I thought
that you understood that!

257
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,449
I wasn't <i>coping.</i>

258
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,652
I was <i>covering.</i>

259
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,087
For you. I was...

260
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,489
To take care of <i>you.</i>

261
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,692
And now you're punishing me
over and over

262
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:44,596
because I dared to take
things into my own hands

263
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,999
because I recognized
the spiral I was falling into,

264
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
and I went and did something about it?

265
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,801
I was putting you first.

266
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,637
That's what you do in a marriage!

267
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,705
Or I guess that's not what <i>you</i> do.

268
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,975
I took care of myself
so that I would survive!

269
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,778
And all that does is make you angry.

270
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,647
Look at you.

271
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,448
What...

272
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,683
What is it, Jackson?

273
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,819
What... what pisses you off so much...

274
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,356
That I chose to go after
the thing that I needed to heal

275
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,725
or that the thing I needed wasn't you?

276
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,294
The thing that <i>I</i> needed was <i>you!</i>

277
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:22,901
I survived.

278
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,671
You survived.

279
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,506
But I do not think we can survive this.

280
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,643
No, I'm not getting divorced,
Jackson, okay?

281
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,245
No one in my family
has ever been divorced.

282
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,414
Everyone in my family has.

283
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,416
Sometimes marriages
just don't work out.

284
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,818
It's not just
the harder thing sometimes.

285
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,721
- Maybe sometimes it's healthier.
- I'm not giving up on us. I won't.

286
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,556
- You already did.
- My God!

287
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,891
- Stop saying that!
- You take for granted

288
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:50,329
that I'm just gonna wait for you,
and wait and wait, no matter what!

289
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,165
But divorce is not some
dirty word, April, not for me.

290
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,795
In fact, right now, it's a light
at the end of a really dark tunnel.

291
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,072
- What are you doing?
- Really?

292
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,040
That's what this has been to you?

293
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,576
Oh, I'm so sorry I kept you
locked away in this prison camp!

294
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,578
- Hey!
- You just want to end it, huh?

295
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,826
- That's not what I said.
- Well, what <i>are</i> you saying?

296
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:11,583
- You would know if you would listen!
- I <i>am</i> listening!

297
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,902
- What are you doing?
- I'm throwing cookies!

298
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:15,131
- Why?!
- Because!

299
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:16,521
- Because why?
- I don't know!

300
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,557
- You're being ridiculous!
- Stop!

301
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,858
- Stop.
- I know!

302
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,962
What...

303
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:27,032
- What is happening to us?
- I don't... know.

304
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,435
How did we get to this?

305
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,704
I don't know.

306
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,208
How do we make it stop?

307
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,130
- Mm.
- Wait.

308
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,365
We should... probably not do this.

309
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,833
Probably not... not a good idea.

310
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,403
- No. Yeah, absolutely.
- It's not a good idea.

311
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:19,478
You know what they call that?
Divorce.

312
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:22,481
And it wasn't an ultimatum.
I gave you a choice.

313
00:15:23,283 --> 00:15:25,017
Where's my maxillofacial consult?

314
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:26,185
- On the way.
- G.C.S. is 9.

315
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:28,521
Pupils are asymmetric.
We need to establish an airway.

316
00:15:28,522 --> 00:15:30,223
- What do you got?
- He fell 20 feet.

317
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:32,325
C6-7 unstable fracture.

318
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:35,161
He's breathing on his own,
but he needs a secure airway.

319
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:36,696
Okay. Laryngoscope, please.

320
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:38,664
- Wait. Why are you here?
- Airway. You paged me.

321
00:15:38,665 --> 00:15:41,634
I thought you were going to the airport,
flying to Jordan with April.

322
00:15:41,635 --> 00:15:42,568
Yeah. N-no.

323
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:45,404
Um, yeah, I decided
not to go, actually.

324
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:48,975
Uh, scope, please.

325
00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:50,910
Is this flight 2703 to Jordan?

326
00:15:50,911 --> 00:15:52,912
- I need to get on that plane.
- I'm sorry, sir,

327
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:54,513
but once the doors
are officially closed,

328
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:55,715
- there's really noth...
- Please, okay?

329
00:15:55,716 --> 00:15:56,816
My wife's on that flight.

330
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:58,684
I just need to get to my wife,
so if you could just...

331
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,353
Oh, my God. That is so sweet.

332
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:01,921
- So you'll open the doors?
- No.

333
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:04,156
- Are you kidding me right now?
- I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.

334
00:16:04,157 --> 00:16:07,260
- Your plane's leaving.
- What?

335
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:15,601
What the hell do you mean that
Owen's not gonna be there with you?

336
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:17,837
I'm not gonna be there alone.
There's a whole unit of us.

337
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:20,106
We work together.
We're... we're friends.

338
00:16:20,107 --> 00:16:22,275
I mean, we're more than that.
We're like family.

339
00:16:22,276 --> 00:16:23,910
We have each other's backs.
We get each other.

340
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:26,112
Mm-hmm.
Like I don't get you, right?

341
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:29,448
Come with me. Come on.

342
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:31,550
I-it's not too late.
I can make a couple phone calls.

343
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:33,119
We always need more
surgeons over there.

344
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,221
April, no.
My answer hasn't changed.

345
00:16:35,222 --> 00:16:38,624
If you could just see
what it's like over there, the work we do.

346
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,359
It's important.

347
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,028
It's immediate. It's essential.

348
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:46,032
There's no filter.
There's no time to even...

349
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:48,234
So often around here,

350
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:50,736
we, like, walk through life
and get caught up with all this stuff.

351
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:51,570
There's no stuff over there.

352
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:54,540
Every day, every patient has purpose.
It has meaning.

353
00:16:57,477 --> 00:17:00,112
I-I want you to know it
the way that I know it.

354
00:17:00,113 --> 00:17:01,814
And I can't just pick up and go.

355
00:17:01,815 --> 00:17:03,482
I have commitments.

356
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:04,717
- I have people.
- Who? Who?

357
00:17:04,718 --> 00:17:06,285
What people do you have here

358
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:08,154
that would prevent you
from coming overseas with me?

359
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:09,288
Patients.

360
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:10,189
I mean, I'm not willing

361
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,391
to just abandon people
that depend on me.

362
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:16,578
And I am?

363
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,098
Kind of. Kind of, yeah.

364
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:21,334
I'm still getting a lot of necrosis.

365
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:22,835
I'm afraid that...

366
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:26,339
The stupid paramedian forehead
flap is dying... again.

367
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,673
This is the second one.

368
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:30,142
I do not know why this is happening.

369
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:32,178
I harvested two blood vessels this time

370
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:33,746
just to make sure that it wouldn't...

371
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:39,518
I was so careful to avoid clotting,
but it's still just...

372
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,822
I'm sorry. We'll figure this out.

373
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:44,423
This isn't your fault, you know.

374
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:47,760
Maybe my face just doesn't like
forehead flaps.

375
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:49,528
Hey.

376
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:52,264
You will figure this out.
You always do.

377
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:54,800
It's not like we haven't
had setbacks before.

378
00:17:54,801 --> 00:17:55,835
Yeah.

379
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:57,069
I know. It's just...

380
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,806
Just crappy 'cause this one's
happening right before Christmas

381
00:18:00,807 --> 00:18:05,277
when your wife's off being some
kind of superhero in a desert.

382
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:07,947
And, I mean...

383
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:10,816
I was around for what happened
this time last year...

384
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:13,052
when you lost Samuel.

385
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:15,721
And I know, well...

386
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:18,157
things have to be tough
for you right now.

387
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:25,398
Come on!
Just give me a signal! Just...

388
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:27,566
Damn it!

389
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:29,802
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

390
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,541
Come on!

391
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:41,714
Do you need more anesthetic?

392
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:43,082
No, I'm okay.

393
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,583
I heard you were down here.

394
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:46,252
What happened, baby?

395
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:48,187
It's nothing.
It was just an accident at home.

396
00:18:48,188 --> 00:18:51,924
Have you heard from April?
Did she call you today?

397
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:53,659
She's busy over there, you know.

398
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,729
I mean, she probably doesn't
even realize what day it is.

399
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,331
How can I help you?

400
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:01,167
What do you need?

401
00:19:01,168 --> 00:19:03,369
You know, I could use
more Lidocaine with epi,

402
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,370
if you wouldn't mind.

403
00:19:04,371 --> 00:19:05,971
I'll find some.

404
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:22,455
Aah! God!

405
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:52,022
It is so good to be back!

406
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:55,182
- April.
- I'm... I'm not working.

407
00:19:55,183 --> 00:19:57,618
I'm... I'm just...
I'm not ready to work yet.

408
00:20:02,391 --> 00:20:05,092
Hey. I'm gonna head in to work.

409
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:06,127
You have breakfast?

410
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,068
You know, you haven't been
to church in a while.

411
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:17,104
What do you say we go together?

412
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:18,272
Huh?

413
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:22,176
Hey.

414
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:25,079
Look at me, sweetheart.

415
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,182
Hmm?

416
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:29,283
What if we...

417
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,287
try again?

418
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:35,189
Hmm?

419
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,291
Let's try for another baby.

420
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:41,262
Why would you say that?

421
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:42,930
No, I just want...

422
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:45,466
What?! What do <i>you</i> want?

423
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:47,868
- April...
- Screw you.

424
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:50,871
Screw you for even suggesting that.

425
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:52,607
Screw you.

426
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:54,208
Okay.

427
00:20:55,911 --> 00:20:58,446
All right.

428
00:20:58,447 --> 00:21:00,781
I'll go.

429
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:05,086
I'll just go in to work.

430
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:16,731
Get off of me!

431
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:18,265
- Get off!
- Warren!

432
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:19,767
I was just marking her face
for surgery.

433
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:22,236
- That marker reeks!
- All right, guys, uh...

434
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:23,237
She keeps trying
to take off her bandages.

435
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:25,306
I'm not doing this anymore!
I can't! I'm done!

436
00:21:25,307 --> 00:21:27,074
All right, Warren, Wilson,
give us a minute.

437
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:28,442
Hey, Tatiana, what is going on?

438
00:21:28,443 --> 00:21:29,443
What is it?

439
00:21:29,444 --> 00:21:31,445
I had a life before this!

440
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:33,180
I had a life!

441
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:35,750
Then I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time,

442
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:38,986
and now my face
is melted off of my face!

443
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:40,988
It's been a year and a half,

444
00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:43,357
and there's so much more to go.

445
00:21:43,358 --> 00:21:44,659
So many more surgeries!

446
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,093
And with each one, you get better.

447
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:47,628
This is my life now...

448
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:50,798
These walls, this bed, you!

449
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,199
I want it back.

450
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,369
I want it all back
to who I was before.

451
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,305
I know. I know.

452
00:22:11,386 --> 00:22:13,287
Oh, hey. Good morning.

453
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:14,822
Morning, sir. Yeah.

454
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:16,223
Mm-hmm.

455
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:24,699
<i>We're having a baby</i>

456
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,801
<i>We're having a baby</i>

457
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:28,969
<i>We're having a baby</i>

458
00:22:29,605 --> 00:22:31,172
Ooh. Hey. What you doing?

459
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:33,541
- Oh.
- Um...

460
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,510
We're dancing.

461
00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:37,578
- Dance.
- Right on.

462
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:39,046
Right on.

463
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:42,517
Oh. Hi.

464
00:22:42,518 --> 00:22:43,518
Hi.

465
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,086
Well, who died?

466
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:46,487
- What?!
- Nobody.

467
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:49,557
I only dance it out
when something bad happens.

468
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:51,292
- Oh.
- Not today.

469
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:53,528
- Did someone...
- Did I leave my...

470
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:54,729
Well, all right!

471
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,797
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.

472
00:22:55,798 --> 00:22:57,064
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

473
00:23:00,903 --> 00:23:01,903
What the hell?

474
00:23:03,806 --> 00:23:05,173
Oh.

475
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:08,242
Hey.

476
00:23:08,243 --> 00:23:09,944
Hey!

477
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:11,312
Oh, all right. All right.

478
00:23:11,313 --> 00:23:13,114
We celebrating the new baby?

479
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:14,782
- What?
- Wait. What?

480
00:23:14,783 --> 00:23:16,784
What did she say? Torres?

481
00:23:16,785 --> 00:23:18,252
What... what did you say?

482
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:20,755
Uh, well...

483
00:23:20,756 --> 00:23:21,622
I'm so sorry.

484
00:23:21,623 --> 00:23:24,992
We are actually celebrating a baby.

485
00:23:24,993 --> 00:23:26,394
I am pregnant.

486
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:27,962
Oh, my God!

487
00:23:27,963 --> 00:23:28,963
- Holy crap.
- Yeah, yeah.

488
00:23:30,632 --> 00:23:32,166
- Congratulations.
- Thank you!

489
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:33,568
- Whoo!
- Congratulations!

490
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:34,836
Yeah!

491
00:23:34,837 --> 00:23:36,237
Hey, hey.

492
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:38,439
Thank you! Thank you!

493
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:41,509
Work it out.

494
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:50,397
- It's one small concession.
- It's not small.

495
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:54,868
Look, we are about to tell my parents
that we got married, eloped.

496
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:57,538
They wanted to be at my wedding.

497
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,206
They thought
they were at my wedding.

498
00:23:59,207 --> 00:24:01,508
I'm just not comfortable with it.
I mean, you know that.

499
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:03,210
I know that you're not religious.

500
00:24:03,211 --> 00:24:06,246
So why are you asking me
to lead your family in prayer?

501
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:09,516
Because they're predisposed
to not like you.

502
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:11,118
You're marrying
a rich, handsome surgeon.

503
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:13,087
Stop it. I know.

504
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:14,788
We embarrassed them.

505
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:17,057
And we will apologize for that.
Sincerely, okay?

506
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:18,726
But I'm not gonna change who I am

507
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:20,194
- just to get your parents to like me.
- No, no, no.

508
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:22,296
No, I don't want you
to change who you are.

509
00:24:22,297 --> 00:24:24,298
- You want me to lie.
- No. Come on.

510
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,900
It's... it's a gesture of good faith.

511
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:28,736
My gesture of good faith

512
00:24:28,737 --> 00:24:31,605
is being a wonderful husband
to their beautiful daughter.

513
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:33,307
It's one day.

514
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:35,442
One prayer.

515
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:38,946
Not like I'm asking you
to go get baptized.

516
00:24:38,947 --> 00:24:40,481
I'm not.

517
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:42,549
Their first real impression of me.

518
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,485
What happens after at the holidays

519
00:24:44,486 --> 00:24:47,755
when I'm suddenly not praying?

520
00:24:47,756 --> 00:24:49,423
Well...

521
00:24:49,424 --> 00:24:51,158
Are you kidding me?

522
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,260
You want this to go on
for how long exactly?

523
00:24:53,261 --> 00:24:57,231
No, I just... I just want them
to like you and accept us.

524
00:24:57,232 --> 00:24:59,333
Well, if you respect me, they will.

525
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:02,936
- Jackson. Please. I...
- April, this conversation's over.

526
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:06,240
Excuse me?

527
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:08,509
You knew who I was
when we got married.

528
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,110
Okay? We talked about this.

529
00:25:10,111 --> 00:25:12,146
We negotiated
our whole wedding around it.

530
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:13,480
I thought that we agreed

531
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:15,282
that we would respect
each other's differences.

532
00:25:15,283 --> 00:25:18,252
So, yeah, for me,
this conversation's over.

533
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:21,989
- Just over?
- Yeah. I'm done with it.

534
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:27,161
Maybe I didn't...

535
00:25:27,162 --> 00:25:29,463
Maybe I didn't know
who I was marrying.

536
00:25:29,464 --> 00:25:31,965
- Really? Okay.
- Yeah, because you know what?

537
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:33,834
The way that you're speaking
to me right now,

538
00:25:33,835 --> 00:25:35,602
the way that you're acting,
is not who I married.

539
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:38,038
Yeah, I could say the same thing.

540
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:41,942
You're right, because you know what?

541
00:25:41,943 --> 00:25:44,278
We thought about it
for all of like 18 hours.

542
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,481
What are you saying...
You wish we hadn't got married?

543
00:25:47,482 --> 00:25:49,316
No.

544
00:25:49,317 --> 00:25:51,185
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?</i>

545
00:25:51,186 --> 00:25:52,953
<i>We are now beginning
our initial descent</i>

546
00:25:52,954 --> 00:25:55,055
<i>into Port Columbus
International Airport.</i>

547
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:56,490
<i>Please raise your tray tables</i>

548
00:25:56,491 --> 00:25:59,059
<i>and place your seats
in the upright position.</i>

549
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,994
My parents are picking us up.

550
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:03,363
You want the rest of my peanuts?

551
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:06,366
I'm allergic to peanuts.

552
00:26:07,836 --> 00:26:09,570
It looks like a lovely wedding.

553
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:12,306
Congratulations again.

554
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:15,409
She's a really... beautiful bride.

555
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,411
Hmm.

556
00:26:17,412 --> 00:26:19,313
Hey, what's wrong?
Are you feeling pain?

557
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:21,381
No. No. I'm not.

558
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:22,716
It's just...

559
00:26:22,717 --> 00:26:24,084
Look at me.

560
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:25,385
I'm hideous.

561
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:27,221
No. Do not say that.

562
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:28,889
No one will ever look at me

563
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,991
the way you're looking
at April in these pictures.

564
00:26:30,992 --> 00:26:32,259
Tatiana, you're wrong.

565
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,228
- Please.
- Okay? I look at you,

566
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:37,531
and I see such incredible strength.

567
00:26:37,532 --> 00:26:39,733
I see bravery.

568
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:44,004
I see humor and persistence...

569
00:26:44,005 --> 00:26:45,138
Beauty.

570
00:26:47,008 --> 00:26:49,910
Now, these surgeries, they're
gonna give you back a face,

571
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:53,080
but don't you dare for a single moment

572
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:54,982
think that you're not
already beautiful.

573
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,591
Oh, I can't believe we're doing this.

574
00:27:04,592 --> 00:27:06,393
I can.

575
00:27:06,394 --> 00:27:08,562
You may now kiss.

576
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:23,310
I know you think it's silly.

577
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:24,778
Well, I didn't say that.

578
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,546
But I'm serious, okay?

579
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:28,448
No premarital sex.

580
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:31,051
How serious?
Like "absolutely not" serious

581
00:27:31,052 --> 00:27:34,354
or "I could be convinced" serious?

582
00:27:38,126 --> 00:27:41,094
We will survive one more night.

583
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:42,629
Speak for yourself.

584
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,665
- If we wait...
- Mmhmm.

585
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:48,502
...our wedding night
will be <i>so amazing.</i>

586
00:27:48,503 --> 00:27:50,437
And tonight could also be...

587
00:27:50,438 --> 00:27:52,139
so amazing.

588
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,745
- Okay.
- Mmhmm?

589
00:27:58,746 --> 00:27:59,780
- Okay.
- Mmhmm?

590
00:27:59,781 --> 00:28:01,348
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmhmm?

591
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:02,749
You...

592
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,318
What's that?

593
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,452
Good night, Jackson.

594
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:21,435
I'm gonna go now.

595
00:28:40,188 --> 00:28:42,222
Good night, Jackson.

596
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:43,557
You put the chain on?

597
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:44,558
I'll see you in the morning.

598
00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:51,665
All right.

599
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:55,669
Forget something?

600
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:05,212
- What time?
- What about this one?

601
00:29:05,213 --> 00:29:08,682
I really have my heart set
on getting married in white.

602
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:10,884
The wedding dress
you're wearing is gorgeous.

603
00:29:10,885 --> 00:29:12,586
I know a cleaner
who can get that stain out.

604
00:29:12,587 --> 00:29:14,588
Yeah, thank you,
but I need a new dress.

605
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:16,323
I'll see what I have in the back.

606
00:29:16,324 --> 00:29:18,058
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

607
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,860
Yes, thank you. Bye.

608
00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:21,428
All right.

609
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:23,430
We've got ourselves
a justice of the peace.

610
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:25,599
Tomorrow afternoon,
he will marry us.

611
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,833
Uh, a justice of the peace?

612
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:27,868
Mm-hmm.

613
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:29,770
Okay, so, um...

614
00:29:29,771 --> 00:29:32,439
- Our wedding will be...
- Legal. Yeah.

615
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,041
He's got a license.

616
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:36,443
He's not an Elvis or a pirate

617
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:37,577
or a cartoon character.

618
00:29:37,578 --> 00:29:42,349
I-I... I had just really hoped
that we'd find a minister.

619
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,451
Someone nondenominational,
obviously,

620
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:46,353
but, you know, just someone
who's at least been ordained.

621
00:29:46,354 --> 00:29:48,021
April, I'm not religious.

622
00:29:48,022 --> 00:29:50,123
No, I know, I know.
Just having someone

623
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:52,025
with some sort of relationship
with God marry us

624
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:53,293
is kind of important to me.

625
00:29:53,294 --> 00:29:55,929
I mean, even finding this guy
wasn't easy on such short notice.

626
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,066
I mean, having a wedding
without a lot of God talk

627
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:00,467
is kind of important to <i>me.</i>

628
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:05,405
I always had such, like, a clear idea
of what my wedding would look like.

629
00:30:05,406 --> 00:30:09,576
Want me to bring you back
to the barn, or were you...

630
00:30:09,577 --> 00:30:12,646
No! Stop it, Jackson. No.

631
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:18,752
I just want God at my wedding.

632
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:21,388
I want him there for the most
important day of my life.

633
00:30:21,389 --> 00:30:23,256
Well, you know
that after we get married,

634
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:26,059
I'm not gonna turn
into this churchgoing guy.

635
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,061
You know,
I watch football on Sundays.

636
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:30,797
You are not changing who you are,

637
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,468
and I do not want you to.

638
00:30:34,469 --> 00:30:37,237
But you can't expect me
to change who I am, either.

639
00:30:37,238 --> 00:30:39,806
How's this one?

640
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:42,909
Oh. Right idea, wrong color.

641
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:48,415
- Okay.
- Yeah?

642
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:51,351
I'll make some phone calls,
and we'll find an ordained minister.

643
00:30:51,352 --> 00:30:52,519
- Thank you.
- Mmhmm.

644
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:56,823
Did you see what we just did there?

645
00:30:56,824 --> 00:30:57,924
We disagreed.

646
00:30:57,925 --> 00:30:59,259
We discussed.

647
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,694
We compromised.

648
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:02,429
We are pretty amazing
at this marriage thing.

649
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,997
- We are.
- This one?

650
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:06,466
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

651
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:09,002
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Don't look! It's bad luck!

652
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:10,570
Yes, yes, yes!

653
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:16,543
No, no, wait.
You can't steal all my fries.

654
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:19,313
Sure, I can. What's mine is yours.
What's yours is mine.

655
00:31:19,314 --> 00:31:21,348
We're not married yet.

656
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:22,749
- Oh! Ooh!
- Aw, crap.

657
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,585
- Sorry. Crap, crap, crap.
- Oh, no! Aah!

658
00:31:24,586 --> 00:31:25,752
You know what?
No more fries for you.

659
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:28,922
- It was an accident.
- No, no. No more.

660
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:31,692
Hey.

661
00:31:31,693 --> 00:31:33,360
Where are we gonna live?

662
00:31:33,361 --> 00:31:34,361
After?

663
00:31:34,362 --> 00:31:38,332
Well, I was thinking...
What about my place?

664
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,767
Absolutely.

665
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:42,269
- Really?
- Yeah.

666
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,904
It's way nicer. It's bigger.
It's perfect.

667
00:31:43,905 --> 00:31:45,038
Great.

668
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,341
But I'm not changing my name.

669
00:31:47,342 --> 00:31:49,009
What? Avery's a great name.

670
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,277
So is Kepner. You want to take it?

671
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:51,879
- Sure.
- Really?

672
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,380
No.

673
00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:54,882
No, I'm not changing my name.

674
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:56,516
Okay.

675
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:58,418
I didn't expect you to, either.

676
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:00,921
- That's not really a thing for me.
- It's not?

677
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:02,289
No, definitely not.

678
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:06,226
What?

679
00:32:06,227 --> 00:32:07,294
Holy crap.

680
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:09,129
We did this!

681
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,964
- We are doing this.
- We're doing this.

682
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:43,085
I love you. I always have.

683
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,142
Even the things I don't like, I love.

684
00:32:45,143 --> 00:32:46,548
You're getting married?

685
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:49,285
Unless you can give me
a reason not to.

686
00:32:50,187 --> 00:32:52,021
Look, we're not doing this
anymore, okay?

687
00:32:52,022 --> 00:32:54,257
No more screwing in closets.
No more screwing anywhere.

688
00:32:54,258 --> 00:32:56,626
I told you...
last time was the last time.

689
00:32:57,828 --> 00:32:59,962
Hey. What's wrong?

690
00:32:59,963 --> 00:33:02,498
I am supposed to do
a facial reanimation surgery.

691
00:33:02,499 --> 00:33:05,134
A procedure Sloan practically
invented my third year.

692
00:33:05,135 --> 00:33:06,936
Done it with him
like a handful of times.

693
00:33:06,937 --> 00:33:08,938
I mean, I never...

694
00:33:08,939 --> 00:33:10,006
There's no way
I can do this on my own.

695
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:12,174
- Of course you can.
- No, you haven't seen him do it.

696
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:14,677
He's brilliant, okay, and so precise.

697
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:16,312
I just needed more time.

698
00:33:16,313 --> 00:33:18,014
You can do this, Jackson.

699
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:20,550
April, what if I can't?
What if I make her worse?

700
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:21,951
This woman's counting on me,

701
00:33:21,952 --> 00:33:24,186
and I promised that I could help.

702
00:33:24,187 --> 00:33:26,622
Then you will. You will.

703
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:29,325
I know you will.

704
00:33:29,326 --> 00:33:31,961
You are not a person who makes
promises he doesn't keep.

705
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,731
Okay, let's push 10 of morphine.

706
00:33:35,732 --> 00:33:36,632
Yeah.

707
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:39,535
- What do we got?
- Tatiana Flauto, 30s.

708
00:33:39,536 --> 00:33:42,004
Some psycho threw acid on her face.

709
00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:43,072
Police got him, though.

710
00:33:43,073 --> 00:33:45,408
A good samaritan gave her
a towel with ice in it

711
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:46,809
before the paramedics got there.

712
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,244
And it adhered to the burns.

713
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:49,512
We haven't been able
to see underneath.

714
00:33:49,513 --> 00:33:51,547
Right. All right, let's start
with a bottle of saline, please.

715
00:33:51,548 --> 00:33:52,748
No.

716
00:33:52,749 --> 00:33:54,383
Thank you.

717
00:33:54,384 --> 00:33:56,986
Hi. Tatiana, is it?
My name is Dr. Avery.

718
00:33:56,987 --> 00:34:00,022
I'd like to wet this towel with saline
so it'll come off easier, okay?

719
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:02,425
- Will you let me do that?
- I'm scared, I'm scared!

720
00:34:02,426 --> 00:34:04,193
I know. I know.
It's okay. It's all right.

721
00:34:04,194 --> 00:34:05,995
You're safe now, okay?
You're safe here.

722
00:34:05,996 --> 00:34:07,330
I just need you to keep still

723
00:34:07,331 --> 00:34:08,898
so that I can get a look
at what's going on.

724
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:10,733
- No, no, no!
- I know. It's okay. You're okay.

725
00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:12,602
You're okay.
I'm gonna help you.

726
00:34:12,603 --> 00:34:13,603
Here comes the saline.

727
00:34:13,604 --> 00:34:16,505
- No, no, no, no!
- Okay. Here we go.

728
00:34:16,506 --> 00:34:18,274
All right, it's okay.

729
00:34:18,275 --> 00:34:19,909
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

730
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:22,445
Really good. Now we got
to remove this towel, okay?

731
00:34:22,446 --> 00:34:23,913
We're gonna get started.
It's gonna hurt.

732
00:34:23,914 --> 00:34:25,615
So I need you to take
a deep breath for me, okay?

733
00:34:25,616 --> 00:34:27,016
Deep breath.

734
00:34:27,017 --> 00:34:28,117
Here we go. All right.

735
00:34:28,118 --> 00:34:30,052
No! No!

736
00:34:30,053 --> 00:34:31,520
It's okay.

737
00:34:33,423 --> 00:34:34,890
You're doing great.

738
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:35,925
Okay.

739
00:34:35,926 --> 00:34:37,293
All done. You did great.

740
00:34:37,294 --> 00:34:39,095
You did great.

741
00:34:39,096 --> 00:34:40,963
Uh, we need to get Sloan
down here immediately.

742
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:44,700
Uh, Sloan is on a plane
to Idaho right now.

743
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:45,968
Can you handle this?

744
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:47,436
- Breathe.
- What is it? What's wrong?

745
00:34:47,437 --> 00:34:48,704
It's too bad! You can't fix my face!

746
00:34:48,705 --> 00:34:49,939
- No, no. No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no!

747
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,275
Tatiana, hey.
I know that we just met, all right?

748
00:34:53,276 --> 00:34:55,277
But what you don't know
is that you and I,

749
00:34:55,278 --> 00:34:56,879
we are a team now.

750
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,548
It's gonna be you and me. We're gonna
get through this together, all right?

751
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:01,117
I'm not gonna lie.
It's not gonna be easy,

752
00:35:01,118 --> 00:35:02,184
and it's not gonna be quick,

753
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:04,220
but I'm gonna be right here
the entire time, okay?

754
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:06,822
I will not leave your side.

755
00:35:06,823 --> 00:35:08,924
I promise you.

756
00:35:08,925 --> 00:35:12,128
Okay? All right.

757
00:35:12,129 --> 00:35:13,763
Let's get Mepitel
and Xeroform, please.

758
00:35:13,764 --> 00:35:16,499
Jackson. Hey.

759
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,801
It's okay. Really.

760
00:35:18,802 --> 00:35:21,337
I lost some... some friends
that day.

761
00:35:21,338 --> 00:35:22,872
I hate Sloan.

762
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:25,541
Even when I'm perfect,
he talks to me like I'm an idiot.

763
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:28,644
Well, try spending a day in the E.R.
with Dr. Major Owen Hunt.

764
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:29,812
That man is dark.

765
00:35:29,813 --> 00:35:33,149
He is a dark,
pig-stabbing, scary man.

766
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,350
What?

767
00:35:34,351 --> 00:35:38,187
What's the matter?

768
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:41,457
This is where Reed was shot...

769
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:44,994
Where I found her.
I slipped in her blood right there.

770
00:35:44,995 --> 00:35:46,763
I haven't been back here since.

771
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:53,069
There's an elevator upstairs
near where Charles died.

772
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,238
I never use it.

773
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:01,944
Hey.

774
00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:04,113
You... you okay? Hey.

775
00:36:04,114 --> 00:36:07,116
Oh. Okay.

776
00:36:07,117 --> 00:36:08,785
I know. I know.

777
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:11,687
Okay? We're... we're here.
We're okay.

778
00:36:11,688 --> 00:36:13,623
I had a gun pointed at me.

779
00:36:13,624 --> 00:36:15,458
I know. I know.

780
00:36:15,459 --> 00:36:17,627
My life flashed before my eyes.

781
00:36:17,628 --> 00:36:20,029
- It... it... it really did.
- Shh. Okay.

782
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,299
And it was so...

783
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,168
boring!

784
00:36:27,738 --> 00:36:31,407
I just kept thinking,
"I don't want to die a virgin."

785
00:36:31,408 --> 00:36:34,143
Oh.

786
00:36:34,144 --> 00:36:37,480
You can fix that.

787
00:36:37,481 --> 00:36:39,415
Was that a proposition?

788
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:40,817
No, I meant... Oh, oh!

789
00:36:40,818 --> 00:36:42,752
No! No, no, no, no.
I-I didn't mean...

790
00:36:42,753 --> 00:36:43,853
No, I... no.

791
00:36:43,854 --> 00:36:45,221
- I was... I... It was a joke.
- Yeah.

792
00:36:45,222 --> 00:36:47,089
I was making a totally stupid joke.

793
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,324
Yeah, it wasn't good. Yeah.

794
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:49,759
Okay. I'm...

795
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,260
En...

796
00:36:51,261 --> 00:36:54,130
- Good luck with Sloan.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

797
00:36:57,367 --> 00:37:00,036
Well, that girl is weird.

798
00:37:02,906 --> 00:37:04,941
I'm a virgin. Yes. So what?

799
00:37:04,942 --> 00:37:06,209
It's not something
I talk about, okay?

800
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,944
We all have things
we don't talk about.

801
00:37:07,945 --> 00:37:10,012
She thinks
your husband walks on water.

802
00:37:11,715 --> 00:37:12,782
Cincinnati, Ohio, pediatrics.

803
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:14,116
Thank you.

804
00:37:14,117 --> 00:37:15,918
Who's next?

805
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:17,787
Uh, I'll go.

806
00:37:17,788 --> 00:37:20,957
Uh, Charles Percy,
Brookings, South Dakota.

807
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,758
I want to be a trauma surgeon.

808
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:25,561
Or maybe vascular.

809
00:37:25,562 --> 00:37:27,864
Or... or, like, uh...

810
00:37:27,865 --> 00:37:29,866
I don't know, actually. Uh...

811
00:37:29,867 --> 00:37:32,768
All right, well, you've got a lot of time
to figure that one out.

812
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:33,836
Who's next?

813
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:35,972
Uh, right here.

814
00:37:35,973 --> 00:37:37,540
Jackson Avery,
originally from Boston...

815
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:38,875
- Oh, h-h-hold on.
- What?

816
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:41,811
Like "Harper Avery" Avery?

817
00:37:41,812 --> 00:37:44,647
Uh, yeah, actually.

818
00:37:44,648 --> 00:37:47,416
- Anyway...
- So you're, like, born to the throne.

819
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:48,518
You know what? I wouldn't...

820
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,820
Do you know
a Catherine Avery, the urologist?

821
00:37:50,821 --> 00:37:52,455
I do, actually.

822
00:37:52,456 --> 00:37:53,756
Are you writing this down?

823
00:37:53,757 --> 00:37:54,991
She's just, like, amazing.

824
00:37:54,992 --> 00:37:56,425
Are you going into urology, too?

825
00:37:56,426 --> 00:37:58,094
No. Cardiothoracic all the way.

826
00:37:58,095 --> 00:37:59,495
Can I be done now?

827
00:37:59,496 --> 00:38:01,764
I'll go!

828
00:38:01,765 --> 00:38:03,132
Hi. I'm April Kepner.

829
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:04,133
I'm from Ohio,

830
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:06,102
and I'm super-excited
to be near the ocean,

831
00:38:06,103 --> 00:38:07,937
although I don't really know
how I feel about the rain yet.

832
00:38:07,938 --> 00:38:09,238
As far as specialty goes,

833
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,806
I'm looking for something
with set hours

834
00:38:10,807 --> 00:38:12,975
so that I can raise kids eventually...

835
00:38:12,976 --> 00:38:14,343
two boys and a girl.

836
00:38:14,344 --> 00:38:15,878
So I'm thinking plastics,
urology, proctology.

837
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:19,090
<i>We talk about
the mechanism of injury...</i>

838
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:20,950
<i>about where it all started.</i>

839
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:22,852
<i>But the truth is...</i>

840
00:38:22,853 --> 00:38:23,953
<i>...it's sort of a myth.</i>

841
00:38:23,954 --> 00:38:28,925
<i>We can't boil every injury</i>
<i>down to one single blow.</i>

842
00:39:05,462 --> 00:39:09,899
This is one of the simpler divorces
I've seen, actually.

843
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:16,739
You want this?

844
00:39:18,642 --> 00:39:20,476
Do you really want this?

845
00:39:32,222 --> 00:39:33,422
Okay.

846
00:39:33,423 --> 00:39:35,725
<i>What hurts us is cumulative.</i>

847
00:39:35,726 --> 00:39:37,259
<i>It happens over time.</i>

848
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,696
<i>We absorb blow after blow...</i>

849
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:45,267
<i>shock after shock,
painful hit after hit.</i>

850
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,125
Is there anything else?

851
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:10,926
Uh, that's it. No.

852
00:40:10,927 --> 00:40:13,129
Okay, then.

853
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:21,037
<i>But even then...</i>

854
00:40:21,038 --> 00:40:23,739
<i>even if we know</i>
<i>exactly how we got here...</i>

855
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,075
<i>it doesn't mean we can fix it.</i>

856
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:27,376
Too late to back out?

857
00:40:27,377 --> 00:40:28,377
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh!

858
00:40:28,378 --> 00:40:31,647
Timothy and I
had a huge fight this morning.

859
00:40:31,648 --> 00:40:32,548
It was probably my fault.

860
00:40:32,549 --> 00:40:34,650
Well, yeah, with that mouth,
probably was.

861
00:40:34,651 --> 00:40:37,119
Look, you guys are gonna fight, okay?

862
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,821
You'll probably have
that same fight for 50 years.

863
00:40:38,822 --> 00:40:42,825
But you just can't let it
become bigger than the two of you.

864
00:40:42,826 --> 00:40:44,493
So, in other words,
marriage is hard...

865
00:40:44,494 --> 00:40:46,929
but not as hard as getting
acid thrown in your face?

866
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:47,797
Yes.

867
00:40:47,798 --> 00:40:49,932
This mouth.
You see? Four years of this.

868
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:52,935
And yet you still agreed
to walk me down the aisle.

869
00:40:52,936 --> 00:40:55,570
You kept every promise you made to me.

870
00:40:57,028 --> 00:40:59,068
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

871
00:41:01,238 --> 00:41:04,080
- I'm sorry about you and April.
- No.

872
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:06,148
Today's about you, okay?

873
00:41:06,149 --> 00:41:08,733
Let's get you married. Hmm?

874
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,620
For you.

875
00:41:12,622 --> 00:41:14,823
<i>You can't heal every wound.</i>

876
00:41:15,587 --> 00:41:20,096
<i>And that's okay.</i>
<i>I have to believe it's okay.</i>

877
00:41:21,465 --> 00:41:23,132
Hey!

878
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:24,200
Oh.

879
00:41:24,201 --> 00:41:26,502
I wasn't sure what you would be
in the mood for,

880
00:41:26,503 --> 00:41:28,037
so I kind of got everything.

881
00:41:28,038 --> 00:41:31,874
Champagne, tequila, Pinot Noir...

882
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:34,043
Pick your poison.

883
00:41:34,044 --> 00:41:35,010
No, thanks.

884
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:36,212
Huh? What's happening?

885
00:41:36,213 --> 00:41:39,115
Did you already start drinking?
Are you... are you drunk?

886
00:41:39,116 --> 00:41:41,337
What? I'm...

887
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:43,540
- Hungry, maybe.
- What?

888
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:46,288
You just signed divorce papers,
and you don't want a drink?

889
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:48,363
What are you...
what are you, pregnant?

890
00:41:50,903 --> 00:41:52,971
What?

891
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:55,064
Oh.

892
00:41:55,065 --> 00:41:56,499
April.

893
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,501
<i>I have to believe</i>
<i>that even if something</i>

894
00:41:58,502 --> 00:42:00,836
<i>seems like it cannot be fixed...</i>

895
00:42:02,873 --> 00:42:06,475
According to the test
I took this morning,

896
00:42:06,476 --> 00:42:08,734
yeah, actually.

897
00:42:10,413 --> 00:42:12,414
I think I am.

898
00:42:12,415 --> 00:42:14,417
<i>...it doesn't mean it's broken.</i>

899
00:42:15,018 --> 00:42:18,966

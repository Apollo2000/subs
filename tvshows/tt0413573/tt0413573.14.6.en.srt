out of a male stripper's penis.

That sounds pretty. What does it mean?

Gun-gina? It's a gun in a vagina.

as much fun as eating warm cookies

Can you stop treating me
like I'm made of glass?

I didn't put my name on the paper

and he will kill me.

I don't call her my sister.

do you have any idea
how badly this could have gone?

You shot yourself in the belly
from inside your vagina,

in the spine.

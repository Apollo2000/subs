1
00:00:00,391 --> 00:00:02,634
<i>They say you fight fire with fire.</i>

2
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:04,402
<i>We do it in medicine all the time.</i>

3
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:06,572
Owen won't say what it's about,

4
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:09,874
and nobody knows this Riggs,
except Kepner.

5
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,175
Maybe Kepner knows.

6
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:13,677
<i>We cut you to repair your injury.</i>

7
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:14,678
Is that snow?

8
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,213
<i>We hurt you to heal you.</i>

9
00:00:16,214 --> 00:00:18,082
Are we still good?

10
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,516
Yeah, we're good. I told you.

11
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:21,585
- I'm just making sure.
- We're good.

12
00:00:21,586 --> 00:00:22,886
Good with what?

13
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:24,127
- Nothing.
- Don't worry about it.

14
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,460
Guys, it's like 60 degrees out.
That can't be snow.

15
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:31,328
<i>We stoke the flames.</i>

16
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,529
They just keep circling each other.

17
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,632
I keep thinking one of them's
gonna pull out a switchblade.

18
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:36,800
Oh, it's about a chick.

19
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:39,736
When two guys hate each other,
it's usually about a chick.

20
00:00:39,737 --> 00:00:41,505
- <i>Is</i> that snow?
- Where?

21
00:00:41,506 --> 00:00:43,807
Yeah, you're right.
That looks like snow out there.

22
00:00:43,808 --> 00:00:46,009
<i>But playing with fire</i>
<i>is a dangerous game.</i>

23
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,512
Well, you know they're saying
it's about you.

24
00:00:48,513 --> 00:00:49,379
What?

25
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,015
You and Riggs.
A torrid affair in Jordan.

26
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:55,152
That's... Oh, no!
That is not at...

27
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:57,754
- Don't worry. I shut that down.
- God! Thank you. Geez!

28
00:00:57,755 --> 00:00:59,423
No, I think it goes back
further than that,

29
00:00:59,424 --> 00:01:00,357
because I worked with Riggs,

30
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:02,126
and he never even mentioned
knowing Hunt.

31
00:01:03,794 --> 00:01:06,028
Oh, my gosh.
Hunt and Riggs...

32
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:08,197
What... what if <i>they</i> had
the torrid affair?

33
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:10,032
Come on.

34
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:11,367
No. Just think about it.

35
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:15,138
Wartime, no rules,
men in uniform, kissing.

36
00:01:16,473 --> 00:01:17,706
Huh.

37
00:01:17,707 --> 00:01:19,108
- Oh, no way.
- What?

38
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:21,810
I didn't say it. Arizona did.

39
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:24,947
I heard that Riggs
lost a patient on the table

40
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:27,183
and tried to blame it on Hunt.

41
00:01:27,184 --> 00:01:29,051
Yeah, the gossip mill is getting a
little out of hand, don't you think?

42
00:01:29,052 --> 00:01:30,019
Oh, no, it's not gossip.

43
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,054
It's, um what do you call it?

44
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:33,488
- Scuttlebutt.
- No.

45
00:01:35,058 --> 00:01:36,525
Callie, um...

46
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:39,061
You and Arizona...
before you guys split...

47
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:41,163
you did the counseling thing, right?

48
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:44,232
Oh, God. Yeah.

49
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:45,233
Yeah.

50
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:49,638
I heard that you were looking
more for a lawyer.

51
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:52,440
You heard that, huh?

52
00:01:53,576 --> 00:01:54,643
Scuttlebutt.

53
00:01:54,644 --> 00:01:56,145
Sure.

54
00:02:02,652 --> 00:02:05,020
- You're on my service today.
- I am.

55
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:07,155
You're good with that, right?

56
00:02:07,156 --> 00:02:09,224
I mean, you and I...

57
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:12,060
you don't have any problem
working under me, right?

58
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:14,162
Well, I think we've established that.

59
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:17,165
No, but see, this...

60
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,267
this is exactly what I'm talking about.

61
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:21,436
Outside of that door,
we are professionals.

62
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:23,004
There can be none of this.

63
00:02:23,005 --> 00:02:24,606
Yes, ma'am.

64
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:29,811
Hey.

65
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:36,951
For the road.

66
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:49,330
Is it snowing?

67
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:57,872
Is it what I think it is?

68
00:02:57,873 --> 00:03:00,274
Uh-huh. Just got the call.
It's all coming here.

69
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:01,975
Okay. How many are we looking at?

70
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:04,244
Over 40.
Where's the protocol for this?

71
00:03:04,245 --> 00:03:05,278
- Bailey...
- Got to be some guidelines.

72
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:07,580
Look, i-it's your first crisis.

73
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:08,615
- You'll be fine.
- I know.

74
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:10,250
As soon as I can find the...

75
00:03:10,251 --> 00:03:12,219
Bailey, there's nothing you need
in those binders.

76
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,420
Okay, you just have to
take things as they come.

77
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:16,689
But you won't see them
until they're right here.

78
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,924
You know what to do.

79
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:21,228
If <i>you're </i> in control,
<i>they're</i> in control.

80
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:23,764
Oh, and, uh, stand on the stairs
when you talk to them.

81
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:25,265
Makes them feel watched over.

82
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:26,299
Is that why you do that?

83
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:33,368
__

84
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:35,808
Four crews of firefighters

85
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:38,978
were trapped battling wildfires
east of town.

86
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:41,648
We have at least
40 injuries en route.

87
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:43,916
I said we would take all of them.

88
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:45,551
40? We're gonna hit capacity, and...

89
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:47,253
We will take all of them.

90
00:03:47,254 --> 00:03:51,157
We're looking at second-,
third-, and fourth-degree burns,

91
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:53,625
smoke inhalation, and some traumas.

92
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:58,730
All non-critical... patients, um...

93
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:04,270
are being transferred
to Seattle Pres and Tacoma.

94
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:09,175
This entire hospital
is now a burn-treatment center.

95
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:11,677
If you are a little rusty...

96
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:14,079
- Did you stay here again last night?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,614
You sleep at all?

98
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:17,282
I'm fine.

99
00:04:17,283 --> 00:04:19,250
Plastics will be available for consult,

100
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:22,421
but they will be in high demand
and cannot be everywhere.

101
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:23,789
If you need them...

102
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,425
- It's definitely because of a chick.
- Shush.

103
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:29,861
Residents, stay with
your assigned attendings

104
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:33,365
unless needed in the burn unit
or in the pit.

105
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:36,201
Uh, everyone who is on call
has been called in.

106
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:37,803
This is an all-hands-on-deck situation.

107
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:40,305
- You with Grey again?
- I'm always with Grey.

108
00:04:40,306 --> 00:04:44,308
Which is the problem for Callie,
so I'm a nun, basically.

109
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,612
Worship at the altar of
our lady of general surgery.

110
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:50,815
- That's a good choice.
- Mm.

111
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:53,183
You know, I tried dating an attending.

112
00:04:53,184 --> 00:04:56,887
It just... it doesn't work.

113
00:04:56,888 --> 00:04:58,389
- Prioritize according to...
- Wilson does it.

114
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,290
Yeah, well, Wilson got lucky.

115
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,560
Triage in the E.R.

116
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:06,530
Send the critical patients
to the burn unit or the O.R.

117
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:10,133
Dr. Avery is your point person
on this, okay?

118
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:12,236
Uh... Let's see.

119
00:05:12,237 --> 00:05:14,738
Then that's...

120
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:20,377
That's it, people.

121
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:22,045
Okay. Get to work.

122
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:27,422
I'll jump on triage
and the most acute injuries.

123
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,686
- April...
- You take any compromised airways.

124
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:30,787
Stop running away from me.

125
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,522
Eventually, we have to find time
and talk about this.

126
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:34,891
- It's been three days already.
- Now is not that time.

127
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:35,992
We have time before it gets crazy.

128
00:05:35,993 --> 00:05:38,361
It's already crazy.
My E.R.'s about to be jam-packed.

129
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:40,329
I-I-I don't have time,
and neither do you.

130
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,998
We would if you'd stop talking about

131
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:43,366
how much damn time we don't have.

132
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:50,206
Choppers are stacking up.
Let's move!

133
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:53,575
Let's go! Move!

134
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:03,351
People, if you are not on your specialty,
you are on burn.

135
00:06:03,352 --> 00:06:05,954
Consider yourselves burns and plastics
specialists for the day.

136
00:06:05,955 --> 00:06:08,123
We treat, debride, admit.

137
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:10,458
If you have any questions
at all, you come find me.

138
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:14,296
Take him to Trauma 2.
This way. Over there.

139
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:16,631
Patient has partial thickness burns

140
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:19,400
on his chest and abdomen
and severe smoke inhalation.

141
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:21,068
Let's get to the part
with the metal in his chest.

142
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:22,904
He lost his footing in the smoke,

143
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:25,506
he fell into the ravine,
and a steel spike broke his fall.

144
00:06:25,507 --> 00:06:28,242
We need a heart ultrasound.
Let's page cardio. Get Pierce.

145
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:29,310
Okay. No problem. I'm here.

146
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:30,445
I can wait for Pierce.

147
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:31,446
I said I got it.

148
00:06:33,048 --> 00:06:35,082
Okay. He has blood
in the pericardium,

149
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,418
but I can't tell if it's
penetrated the ventricle.

150
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:38,453
- Blake, get Pierce.
- Okay.

151
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:40,487
Most likely the only reason
he isn't bleeding out

152
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:41,721
is because the metal
is blocking the hole.

153
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:42,923
That's an interesting theory.

154
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:45,158
Only one way to find out.
Blake, let's pull out the spike.

155
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,326
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

156
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:48,829
We're gonna take it out in the O.R.,
where we can control the bleeding.

157
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,096
There might not be any bleeding,

158
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:52,098
so let's don't fill up an O.R.
until we know that we have to.

159
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:54,968
And risk him bleeding out
before we ever get up there? No.

160
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:57,203
No one is touching this thing
until we get Pierce.

161
00:06:58,138 --> 00:06:59,439
There.

162
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,841
Now she can get a proper look.

163
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:01,842
Who the hell do you think you are?

164
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:03,443
If I say wait, we wait.

165
00:07:03,444 --> 00:07:05,745
You are out of control!
And I will not stand for it.

166
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:07,646
Hey, Kepner, how are we?

167
00:07:07,647 --> 00:07:08,814
Stretched.

168
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:11,417
I need somebody to take a look
at the guy in bed four!

169
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:15,621
Um, I will do it.
I will see bed four.

170
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,194
Tyler... how's Tyler?

171
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:23,429
His hand's pretty bad.
He might lose some fingers.

172
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,763
You tell him he'll live.

173
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,368
I'm Dr. Bailey.
How we doing here?

174
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:29,635
I'm fine.

175
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:32,972
I've been burned so many times,
my wife says I smell like bacon.

176
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:34,773
You need to put
that mask back on.

177
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:36,809
You need to check on
these other guys.

178
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,276
They're in worse shape than me.

179
00:07:38,277 --> 00:07:40,846
We will take care of <i>all</i> of you, okay?

180
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:43,549
So just let me have a look.

181
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,817
Mm-hmm.

182
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:58,563
Okay.

183
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:02,901
How bad is it?

184
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:16,447

185
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,232
- He's bleeding right there.
- In the pericardium.

186
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,534
It's not much.
It'll likely resolve on its own.

187
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:28,569
Or it won't and it will be too late.

188
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,572
Admit him, monitor him closely,
and tell me if his pressure drops.

189
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:33,840
Book an O.R.

190
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:35,642
- Absolutely.
- I'll book an O.R.

191
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:41,381
She's my god.

192
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:48,688
Hey! Hold on.
Do you have time now?

193
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:51,424
Not really, I'm on my way
to surgery with a maniac.

194
00:08:51,425 --> 00:08:53,360
Yeah, so let's do it now
before we both get too busy.

195
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:54,761
All right, well, let's
make it quick, because...

196
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:56,595
- Alex, could you...
- Wilson, go away!

197
00:08:56,596 --> 00:08:59,531
Just give us a minute, okay?
We're busy.

198
00:09:01,135 --> 00:09:02,135
Thanks a lot.

199
00:09:02,136 --> 00:09:04,403
She'll be fine.

200
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:08,875
W-we were taking a... break
at base camp.

201
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:11,644
Casey, I'm gonna need
you to stop talking, okay?

202
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:15,248
There's severe lung damage here.

203
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:15,948
Book an O.R.

204
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:19,285
Casey, we're gonna take you
into surgery right away.

205
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:21,487
O.R.'s backed up.
They're saying it's an hour.

206
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:22,821
Tell them that's not good enough.

207
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:25,391
No. Take these other guys first.

208
00:09:25,392 --> 00:09:27,326
I'll decide who goes where, all right?

209
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:30,929
Hey, I did my best
to get those guys out.

210
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,131
You got to make sure they're okay.

211
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:34,266
Can you do that?

212
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:36,568
Yeah.

213
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:41,507
Let's get him to the burn unit
while we wait for the O.R.

214
00:09:41,508 --> 00:09:43,341
Excuse me.

215
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:44,475
Coming through.

216
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:49,080
Chief, the burn unit is full,
and I need beds down here.

217
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:51,149
We can't take any more.
We're already at capacity.

218
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,119
I have patients with extensive burns
that are on gurneys in the hallway.

219
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,787
- We need to start diverting to other hospitals.
- We're not doing that.

220
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:57,088
Well, I need to know
what we are doing, please.

221
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:58,589
Do I need to notify Seattle Pres?

222
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:01,626
Chief!

223
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:04,696
I said we're not
turning firefighters away.

224
00:10:04,697 --> 00:10:06,230
Come with me.

225
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,034
Okay!

226
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:12,102
You folks, take your food to go.

227
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:15,272
All of these tables go.
Put away this food.

228
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:16,673
We triage here.

229
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:19,376
I need gurneys in lines of three
all the way back.

230
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:21,812
Minor and first-degree burns
are going the pit, guys.

231
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:23,981
Criticals can go
to any available I.C.U. bed.

232
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:26,115
We need burn supplies,
surgical trays,

233
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:28,151
gowns, gloves at every station.

234
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:29,285
This enough room?

235
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:31,054
This will work.

236
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:38,294
I know you have to do
your doctor thing,

237
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:41,130
but maybe you can keep
the full moon under wraps.

238
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:43,799
That's the part
that I kind of need to see.

239
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,336
Oh, <i>you</i> can see
whatever you want.

240
00:10:46,337 --> 00:10:50,205
It's the guys in my squad.
I'll never hear the end of it.

241
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:51,741
I'll be discreet. No free shows.

242
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:53,308
No guy has seen that

243
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:55,544
since a middle school
wardrobe malfunction.

244
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:57,045
Hopefully, you're an expert, a...

245
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:59,214
What, a butt doctor?

246
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:01,584
That can't be right.
You can fix my butt, right?

247
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:05,220
Yes. The burn is confined
to one cheek,

248
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:08,257
and luckily, I have a good one
to compare it to.

249
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:11,159
Wow. Thank you very much.

250
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:14,764
No. No, no, no.
I... and I didn't mean...

251
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:16,865
No. I'll take it.

252
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:18,767
Yeah. It's...

253
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:20,435
It'll do the job.

254
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:24,672
Hang in there, Turner.

255
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:25,940
God.

256
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:28,009
Here I am,
complaining about my butt burn.

257
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:28,943
Don't do that.

258
00:11:28,944 --> 00:11:31,546
Don't feel guilty
for not getting hurt.

259
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:32,380
I mean, I work a job

260
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:34,015
where in order
to make a house payment,

261
00:11:34,016 --> 00:11:36,350
to put food on the table,
there have to be fires.

262
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:40,087
And big fires mean overtime,
hazard pay.

263
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:42,457
You work like hell
to put them out, but...

264
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:47,895
a dirty, little part of you
is thinking, "burn, baby, burn,"

265
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:49,730
and you hate yourself.

266
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:52,400
It sucks.

267
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:54,535
I make my living off of sick babies.

268
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:57,405
You get it.

269
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:01,742
All right. You feel that?

270
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:03,110
- Dr. Hunt?
- Give him morphine.

271
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:04,711
- Owen?
- Mm-hmm.

272
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:06,147
Your mom's boyfriend...
he's a firefighter, right?

273
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:06,914
Yeah. Why?

274
00:12:06,915 --> 00:12:09,283
Because she's here...
Your mom.

275
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:11,452
Nurse's station.
How can I help you?

276
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:13,820
Cross, take over.

277
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:15,621
- Mom?
- Owen!

278
00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:18,724
John was working the fire.
They said they brought him here.

279
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:19,960
Have you seen him?

280
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:22,462
Uh, hang on, hang on.

281
00:12:22,463 --> 00:12:23,596
He is in surgery.

282
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:25,265
- Oh, dear God.
- Dr. Grey and...

283
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:29,970
- Kepner, page Pierce to O.R. 3.
- Okay.

284
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:31,938
Mom, stay right here, okay?

285
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:36,576
There. I was right.
There's blood in the pericardium.

286
00:12:36,577 --> 00:12:38,277
I could've relieved it
with a needle downstairs.

287
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:39,445
You did not need to open him up.

288
00:12:39,446 --> 00:12:41,647
Well, I did, because we're not
in a tent in a war zone.

289
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:43,248
Meredith...

290
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:45,417
Hunt, is there a problem?

291
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:47,587
Grey, the patient on your table
is my mother's boyfriend.

292
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:48,588
How's it look?

293
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:51,090
It's not good.

294
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:52,492
I didn't ask you!

295
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:55,427
Dr. Grey cracked his chest
when she shouldn't have...

296
00:12:55,428 --> 00:12:57,429
Shut your mouth,
step away from the table,

297
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,664
and scrub out.

298
00:12:58,665 --> 00:12:59,865
Hey, what's going on here?

299
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:01,133
You need to scrub in for Riggs.

300
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:02,301
What? Why?

301
00:13:02,302 --> 00:13:05,204
Hunt, I got a guy in the burn unit
missing part of his chest wall.

302
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:06,205
I don't have time...

303
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:07,373
Owen, I have this.

304
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:08,640
Dr. Pierce, we're fine here.

305
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:10,542
Riggs, step back.

306
00:13:10,543 --> 00:13:12,111
Okay, Hunt, I don't work
for you, okay?

307
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:12,911
I work for Pierce.

308
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:14,713
If she says leave, then I'll leave.

309
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:16,148
Hunt, is there a reason

310
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:18,283
that I should be removing Riggs
from this surgery?

311
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,660
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. No. My mom's boyfriend.

312
00:13:36,661 --> 00:13:37,994
- The firefighter.
- Yeah.

313
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:38,995
- He's here.
- Yeah.

314
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:41,197
Meredith is working on him
right now with Riggs.

315
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:42,366
And that's a problem.

316
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,701
Owen, talk to me.
Why is this guy...

317
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:46,035
I just don't want him near my family.

318
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:53,410
Proximal humerus fracture.

319
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:56,179
All he needs is a sling
for a few weeks.

320
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,081
Yeah, but I've got
a full thickness burn

321
00:13:58,082 --> 00:13:59,715
on his hand and forearm.

322
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:01,918
Will a graft even take?
You've got bone exposure.

323
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,419
Give me a minute to think about it.

324
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,720
I'd recommend it.

325
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:06,355
- Yeah, the graft?
- Counseling.

326
00:14:06,356 --> 00:14:09,926
It gave us a sense of where
we were, which was nowhere.

327
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:11,560
But still...

328
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:12,896
Second-degree burns on the chest.

329
00:14:12,897 --> 00:14:14,264
Do you even want to work it out
with Kepner?

330
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:15,765
Can we not do this right now?

331
00:14:15,766 --> 00:14:17,200
Sure.

332
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:21,070
But one thing our therapist said
that turned out to be true...

333
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:22,571
Do not have sex while
you're sorting things out.

334
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:24,540
It's messy. It's confusing. No sex.

335
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:28,444
You guys had sex.

336
00:14:28,445 --> 00:14:31,380
Yeah.

337
00:14:31,381 --> 00:14:33,248
We did, too.

338
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:35,718
- It's... messy.
- It's really messy.

339
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:37,586
- I think you can both get what you need.
- Yeah, I don't know.

340
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:39,021
I mean, I feel like
it's so complicated.

341
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:41,290
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm talking about his hand.

342
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,391
Right.

343
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:45,294
We do a living graft
with an abdominal pedicle flap.

344
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:47,463
We literally sew his hand
into his abdomen.

345
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:50,766
He'll have a graft <i>and</i> a sling.

346
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:51,900
That's good.

347
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:53,268
Yeah.

348
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:54,937
I found the one!

349
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:56,572
Oh, good.

350
00:14:56,573 --> 00:14:58,873
Now you can help me find
an arterial line kit.

351
00:14:58,874 --> 00:14:59,841
Not <i>the</i> one.

352
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:02,410
<i>A</i> one maybe,
but at least an option.

353
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:03,778
I found an option.

354
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,146
She's funny and cute,

355
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:07,315
and she actively contributes
to public safety.

356
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:09,217
She's one of the firefighters?

357
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:11,152
Yes. And she's great.

358
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:13,588
And I think
that she thinks <i>I'm</i> great,

359
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:15,256
but I need you to find out.

360
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:17,191
Sure.

361
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:19,227
Why don't you write her
a little note...

362
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:21,563
you know, the ones with
the boxes that you can check...

363
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:22,630
and I'll pass it along.

364
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,165
Mm.

365
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,933
Mm. Don't you think
that sounds a little childish?

366
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:28,268
Yes, it does!

367
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:30,237
I'm not gonna wingman
a patient for you!

368
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:36,543
I set the Mayfield.

369
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:39,212
Let's just drain the clot and
bring him back to the burn unit.

370
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:45,285
Maybe it was, like,
a classified mission gone bad.

371
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:47,220
- What?
- Hunt and Riggs.

372
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:49,189
Maybe that's why
he won't talk about it.

373
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,124
Maybe it was like a secret mission,

374
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,825
and one of them
double-crossed the other.

375
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,094
I don't want to talk about it.

376
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:55,428
Well, everyone is talking about it.

377
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:56,709
I don't want to gossip about it.

378
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,333
Dr. Hunt's a sleepwalker

379
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,701
and a sleeptalker, actually.

380
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:02,869
Enough!

381
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,104
It's not gossip. It happened.

382
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:07,274
I found him in an on-call room
totally asleep, standing there.

383
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:09,709
He was all, "Help, help!"
It was freaky!

384
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,378
What did he say exactly?

385
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:12,678
"Do something," I think he said?

386
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,147
I don't know. I was a little...

387
00:16:14,148 --> 00:16:16,383
I was scared.

388
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:17,516
Wait. Cross...

389
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:22,687
They'll probably take a big
piece of skin from your back

390
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:24,156
called a latissimus flap.

391
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:26,358
Now, it's gonna leave
a pretty big scar.

392
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:28,294
Scars are okay.

393
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:30,495
They show... where you've been.

394
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:36,501
My leg is the Kelso fire of '08,

395
00:16:36,502 --> 00:16:39,138
and my shoulder's

396
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:41,840
the Yakima Valley of '13.

397
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:44,810
And... oh... that...

398
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:48,346
that's, uh, my oven.

399
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:54,852
Birthday cake
for my wife Ruth's 50th.

400
00:16:57,856 --> 00:16:59,857
Casey... Casey,
we have to intubate you now.

401
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:01,859
No. I can breathe.

402
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,429
Ruth's on her way.

403
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,332
I w-want to talk to her first.

404
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,733
Sir, we really need to give
your lungs a rest, okay?

405
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:11,869
No. I don't need it.

406
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:16,273
Hey...

407
00:17:16,274 --> 00:17:18,308
I don't want it.

408
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,781
I think we can give Casey
a few more minutes

409
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:27,451
till his wife gets here.

410
00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:28,852
But you put that mask on.

411
00:17:28,853 --> 00:17:30,354
Deal.

412
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:36,693
He's being ridiculous.
We have to tube him, right?

413
00:17:36,694 --> 00:17:38,295
His left lung is partially collapsed.

414
00:17:38,296 --> 00:17:40,364
The other one is damaged
from smoke inhalation.

415
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:41,931
It's causing his heart to fail.

416
00:17:41,932 --> 00:17:44,300
Yeah, and he's starting to have
arrhythmias from rhabdo.

417
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:45,368
- Oh. I got to go.
- Yeah, go.

418
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:47,269
We need to clear an O.R.

419
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,337
Uh, no. Casey's right.

420
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:50,907
We need to be treating
the more urgent cases first.

421
00:17:50,908 --> 00:17:52,441
I'm sorry, but what's more urgent

422
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:54,110
than a guy with a hole burned
in his side?

423
00:17:54,111 --> 00:17:56,913
A case that will survive surgery.

424
00:17:56,914 --> 00:17:58,414
So what? We're just supposed to
tell him he's gonna die?

425
00:17:58,415 --> 00:18:00,483
We don't have to tell him.
He knows.

426
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,286
Make him as comfortable as you can,

427
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:06,188
and tell me when his wife gets here.

428
00:18:14,797 --> 00:18:17,433
We are never eating
in that cafeteria again.

429
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:20,169
I'm a little busy right now.
Do you need something?

430
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,338
I needed a break.
I thought I'd take a minute.

431
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:23,572
You know when I had a minute?

432
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:26,342
This morning, when you and Meredith
were whispering in the hallway.

433
00:18:26,343 --> 00:18:27,743
I'm sorry about that.

434
00:18:27,744 --> 00:18:30,179
And she yelled "get away" in my face
like I was a stray dog.

435
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,314
Come on.

436
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:33,615
- It's not funny.
- That's not what she meant.

437
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:35,783
God, you always defend her,

438
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:39,087
even when she's being
a complete bitch to me.

439
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:41,256
- Don't do that. Don't call her that.
- And why wouldn't you?

440
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:43,258
Everyone here just follows her lead.

441
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:45,760
If you're out with Grey,
you're out, and I'm out.

442
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:47,295
Aw, you're not out. You're fine.

443
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:49,697
She spent a year acting like
I didn't even exist.

444
00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:51,832
So what is it? What? You think she
just sees you as my girlfriend?

445
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,301
She doesn't even see me as that.

446
00:18:53,302 --> 00:18:54,602
She would show up in our bedroom

447
00:18:54,603 --> 00:18:56,337
and kick me out
whenever she wanted to.

448
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:57,305
That hasn't happened in a long time.

449
00:18:57,306 --> 00:18:59,441
Yeah, because I hauled you
out of that house.

450
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:00,442
Oh, I'm...

451
00:19:02,044 --> 00:19:04,545
I'm sorry.
You <i>hauled</i> me out of there?

452
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:06,380
I had to. She had
an all-access pass to you.

453
00:19:06,381 --> 00:19:09,283
And you know what the worst part is?
Is that you let her.

454
00:19:09,284 --> 00:19:11,518
- We decided to move in there together.
- Because she's always your priority!

455
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,519
That is not true!

456
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,456
She has been through a lot!
Her husband died!

457
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:17,892
So what, that gives her
a license to treat me like crap?

458
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:19,026
No! No!

459
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:21,495
It means she has the license
to take her crap out on me!

460
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:23,363
It means I'm gonna be there
for her when she needs me,

461
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:25,532
'cause she's the only one
I can count on!

462
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,735
She's the <i>only one?</i>

463
00:19:27,736 --> 00:19:29,870
Just I meant...

464
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:33,239
Look, she stood by me for years
when everybody else left,

465
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
no matter what.

466
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,374
- I didn't mean...
- No, I get it.

467
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,811
You're taking her side again
'cause she is your priority.

468
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:39,692
You don't get to tell me
what my priorities are!

469
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:43,349
I have to focus on my patient.

470
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,251
Look, Jo...

471
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:46,686
Just go.

472
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:59,694
Last stitch repairs
the rupture in the heart wall.

473
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:01,596
3-0 Prolene and pledget hold.

474
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:03,465
Blake, can you snip, please?

475
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:09,537
And Hunt said this guy
was dating his mom, hmm?

476
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:10,639
Suction.

477
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,407
Blake, you heard that, right?

478
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:14,909
Suction here.

479
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,744
Hmm?

480
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:18,112
He's fibrillating. Paddles.

481
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:19,480
Got it.

482
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:23,751
Charge to 10.

483
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,088
Clear.

484
00:20:28,623 --> 00:20:30,324
Charge to 10 again.

485
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:32,459
No, 25, okay?
Let's don't screw around. 25.

486
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,627
25. Clear.

487
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:35,296
This never would've
happened if you hadn't...

488
00:20:35,297 --> 00:20:36,263
It absolutely would have.

489
00:20:36,264 --> 00:20:37,998
We just wouldn't be here
to catch it. Clear!

490
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:41,835
All right, give me
1 milligram of adrenaline.

491
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:44,571
Okay, come on, come on.
Damn it!

492
00:20:44,572 --> 00:20:45,939
Okay, where's the adrenaline?

493
00:20:53,648 --> 00:20:55,449
Oh!

494
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,317
All right.

495
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:03,823
Well, the fire is 80% contained.

496
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:07,393
Okay.

497
00:21:10,597 --> 00:21:11,764
My crew.

498
00:21:11,765 --> 00:21:13,299
No losses today, Casey.

499
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,370
No. Many injuries, but no losses.

500
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:19,772
You prepare them...

501
00:21:19,773 --> 00:21:21,674
the best you can.

502
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:24,343
You can't control everything.

503
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:27,346
You can't control the wind, you know?

504
00:21:27,347 --> 00:21:30,882
You did everything you could.

505
00:21:30,883 --> 00:21:32,684
Now...

506
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:34,786
What... what...
what can I do for you?

507
00:21:34,787 --> 00:21:38,056
Uh, just waiting for Ruth.

508
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:41,059
Okay.

509
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:55,305
This will heal nicely,
probably in about six weeks.

510
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:57,742
So, um...

511
00:21:57,743 --> 00:21:59,209
Maybe we could see each other again?

512
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,644
Like a follow-up appointment?

513
00:22:00,645 --> 00:22:02,980
Oh, um, no. I don't mean...

514
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:04,248
I mean yes.

515
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:06,083
You can always make an appointment
with the admissions nurse.

516
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:08,652
But I di... you, um... okay.

517
00:22:08,653 --> 00:22:10,721
Can you just sit tight?

518
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:12,322
Well, don't sit tight.

519
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:13,858
Just... be.

520
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:15,793
Just be.

521
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:18,528
Heh! I just tried to segue

522
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:21,063
from a wound closure
to a first-date invite.

523
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:22,432
Now, that's just clumsy.

524
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:24,267
- Over her exposed butt.
- And that's creepy.

525
00:22:24,268 --> 00:22:25,402
I need your help.

526
00:22:25,403 --> 00:22:27,670
Can you just go put a good word in?

527
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:31,173
I... you don't need me.
You're a smart, competent woman.

528
00:22:31,174 --> 00:22:34,210
Stretch your wings, Robbins.
Stretch them out.

529
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:35,845
Feel the air.

530
00:22:35,846 --> 00:22:38,014
Stretch them out. Feel the air.

531
00:22:38,015 --> 00:22:39,282
Feel the air.

532
00:22:41,886 --> 00:22:45,087
My wife needs to come home.

533
00:22:45,088 --> 00:22:47,924
I mean,
I knew it was a good idea,

534
00:22:47,925 --> 00:22:49,458
but looking at it up close

535
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:50,893
it's pretty spectacular.

536
00:22:50,894 --> 00:22:52,861
Yeah, yeah. It's a miracle
of the modern age.

537
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:55,798
So, what kind of sex was it?
Make-up sex or break-up sex?

538
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,969
It was... you know,
I-I have no idea, actually.

539
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,137
- Bovie?
- Well, what did April say?

540
00:23:01,138 --> 00:23:03,406
Nothing. She didn't say anything.
She's not talking to me.

541
00:23:03,407 --> 00:23:04,907
She spent the last few months
hunting me down,

542
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:05,808
and now she just keeps walking away.

543
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:07,543
Let's be done talking about this now.

544
00:23:07,544 --> 00:23:08,444
- Agreed.
- Well, okay,

545
00:23:08,445 --> 00:23:10,947
'cause, you know,
break-up sex is, um...

546
00:23:10,948 --> 00:23:13,148
well, it feels sad-happy.
It's an emotional potpourri.

547
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:15,951
All the feelings, all the history,

548
00:23:15,952 --> 00:23:17,820
all of it... it's all just right there,

549
00:23:17,821 --> 00:23:19,655
because it's...
you know, you just know.

550
00:23:19,656 --> 00:23:20,989
You just know that it's the last time,

551
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,958
and it's like taking in
all the air you can

552
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:24,025
before you go underwater.

553
00:23:24,026 --> 00:23:26,829
It's like "do me or die."
Break-up sex is the best.

554
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,229
Yeah, but then you're broken up.

555
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,999
Huh. You know what?
You're right.

556
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,601
Make-up sex is better,

557
00:23:32,602 --> 00:23:34,903
because make-up sex
is like coming up for air

558
00:23:34,904 --> 00:23:36,171
when you thought
there wouldn't be any more air.

559
00:23:36,172 --> 00:23:38,340
So it's like all is forgiven,

560
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:40,475
and you can throw off
your troubles and your clothes,

561
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:42,677
and you're like out of the dark
and into the light,

562
00:23:42,678 --> 00:23:43,978
full speed ahead.

563
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:46,246
Oh, God, it's the best.

564
00:23:46,247 --> 00:23:48,483
So... Which was it?

565
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:49,650
I'm not answering that.

566
00:23:49,651 --> 00:23:51,118
- Jackson.
- I don't know, all right?

567
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,954
Because maybe I thought it was one thing
and she thought it was the other.

568
00:23:52,955 --> 00:23:53,955
- Ooh.
- What?

569
00:23:53,956 --> 00:23:55,857
See? Messy.

570
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:57,959
But you know
what's <i>not</i> messy? This.

571
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,160
I mean, this... this...
this is elegant genius.

572
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:01,328
Mm. Mm-hmm.

573
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:02,396
I'll tell you one thing...

574
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:05,867
he is gonna be pretty surprised
when he wakes up.

575
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,809
I was just looking for extra Betadine.

576
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,280
Which is right there.

577
00:24:21,281 --> 00:24:23,917
So, obviously, lamest excuse ever.

578
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:28,688
You can't just ignore me forever.

579
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:31,357
You don't have to like me
or be my friend

580
00:24:31,358 --> 00:24:32,859
or even be polite to me,

581
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,962
but at <i>least</i> acknowledge
that I exist.

582
00:24:35,963 --> 00:24:38,163
Acknowledge that I'm a person
standing in front of you,

583
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:39,331
saying words.

584
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:42,735
Forget it.

585
00:24:53,713 --> 00:24:56,015
- You got lucky.
- It wasn't luck.

586
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:57,983
He would have died
if I hadn't taken him in.

587
00:24:57,984 --> 00:24:59,484
John's surgery went well.

588
00:24:59,485 --> 00:25:00,985
His doctors expect a full recovery.

589
00:25:00,986 --> 00:25:02,620
He's not awake yet,
but you can see him.

590
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:10,962
Nathan?

591
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:45,803
We don't think
Riggs and Owen's mom...

592
00:25:45,804 --> 00:25:48,505
- You don't think <i>that's</i> the thing?
- No.

593
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:51,408
But do you think
Owen's mom is Riggs' mom?

594
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,077
Because that has happened
to me before.

595
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:57,013
Keep me updated on how he's doing.

596
00:26:00,318 --> 00:26:02,552
So, Riggs knows your mother.

597
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,388
Owen, I want to help you.

598
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:07,424
- Just talk to me.
- Amelia, I'm not like you.

599
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:09,359
I don't need to talk
everything to death.

600
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,193
Listen to what I'm saying.

601
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,329
I do not want your help,
not with this.

602
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,212
Casey is conscious,

603
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,347
but he might not be able to speak.

604
00:26:31,348 --> 00:26:32,882
He can hear you, though.

605
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,617
But he's... he's not hurting?

606
00:26:35,618 --> 00:26:37,186
No, no.
We've made him comfortable.

607
00:26:37,187 --> 00:26:39,421
That's... that's all we can do.

608
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,559
Ruth...

609
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,495
His injuries are quite severe.

610
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,533
You may want to prepare yourself.

611
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:57,705
I've been preparing myself
for 30 years.

612
00:27:05,214 --> 00:27:07,582
I'm just gonna sit with him,
if that's all right.

613
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:10,118
Of course.

614
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:13,121
Mrs. Hunt, it's none of my business,

615
00:27:13,122 --> 00:27:14,622
and I'm not asking,

616
00:27:14,623 --> 00:27:19,227
but Owen is my friend,
and I am worried about him.

617
00:27:19,228 --> 00:27:21,596
How worried do I need to be?

618
00:27:27,568 --> 00:27:29,336
Close the door, dear.

619
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,325
Hey, old man.

620
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:52,559
Mm.

621
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:56,863
They say the fire's almost out.

622
00:28:00,134 --> 00:28:02,135
So this is it.

623
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:04,137
This is the one, huh?

624
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:07,040
Ah.

625
00:28:10,444 --> 00:28:12,711
Doug and Susan
are on their way, so...

626
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:16,816
So don't worry.
I won't be alone.

627
00:28:16,817 --> 00:28:19,018
They said that they love you,

628
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:21,454
and I told them
you love them, too.

629
00:28:23,324 --> 00:28:24,890
I love you.

630
00:28:27,861 --> 00:28:30,296
You did good, Casey.

631
00:28:30,297 --> 00:28:33,131
You did good.

632
00:29:10,102 --> 00:29:11,769
You talked to Owen's mother?

633
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,538
Yeah.

634
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:15,974
What was that about?
Did you find anything out?

635
00:29:17,743 --> 00:29:19,076
Meredith!

636
00:29:19,077 --> 00:29:20,778
Look, it's not my thing.
It's Owen's thing.

637
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:23,114
And he asked me
not to talk about it, so...

638
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:24,849
He's talking to <i>you?</i>

639
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,718
Yeah, he did,
enough so that I can...

640
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:29,053
Why are you shutting me out of this?

641
00:29:29,054 --> 00:29:33,357
Because...
this does not concern you.

642
00:29:33,358 --> 00:29:34,958
- But it concerns you?
- No, it doesn't.

643
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:37,454
I made a promise that I would
help him keep his head above water.

644
00:29:37,455 --> 00:29:39,197
- Promised who?
- To Cristina.

645
00:29:39,198 --> 00:29:43,067
So I am watching him,
and I am letting him be,

646
00:29:43,068 --> 00:29:44,735
and I am not sticking my nose...

647
00:29:44,736 --> 00:29:46,703
What does Cristina
have to do with this?

648
00:29:46,704 --> 00:29:48,639
You're in some sort of
three-way trust circle

649
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,041
with Owen and his ex-girlfriend?

650
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:51,775
- Ex-wife.
- God. Meredith,

651
00:29:51,776 --> 00:29:55,479
you are the most loyal person
I have ever met

652
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,948
to <i>everyone</i> except me.

653
00:29:57,949 --> 00:30:00,884
You're loyal to some woman
halfway across the world...

654
00:30:00,885 --> 00:30:02,753
- Yes, I am.
- ...when I am right here.

655
00:30:02,754 --> 00:30:04,655
Cristina left you. I'm here.

656
00:30:04,656 --> 00:30:05,656
I'm your sister.

657
00:30:05,657 --> 00:30:08,659
You are not my sister.
Cristina is my sister.

658
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,662
You are <i>Derek's</i> sister,
and Derek is gone.

659
00:30:11,663 --> 00:30:13,564
Dr. Grey, I changed
the mediastinal drains...

660
00:30:13,565 --> 00:30:14,765
Get out!

661
00:30:21,072 --> 00:30:23,774
Is this why you hate me?

662
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:26,476
'Cause I remind you of him?

663
00:30:26,477 --> 00:30:28,779
Does it help you to hate me?

664
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,280
Asking you not to push me.

665
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:31,281
Am I like her...

666
00:30:31,282 --> 00:30:34,317
something you cling to
to keep the memory alive?

667
00:30:34,318 --> 00:30:36,119
You are such a child.

668
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,689
You wrap her around you
like some sick widow shawl.

669
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,024
The widow Grey.

670
00:30:41,025 --> 00:30:43,259
She's okay. She's moving on.

671
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,761
She'll never love again,
but she's holding it together.

672
00:30:44,762 --> 00:30:46,897
That is crap. You've given up.

673
00:30:46,898 --> 00:30:49,132
You are crawling into
your little hole and dying.

674
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:51,134
You are hollow.

675
00:30:51,135 --> 00:30:54,304
And Derek would be sick about it
if he could see it.

676
00:30:54,305 --> 00:30:55,805
He would be disgusted.

677
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:59,075
- I want you out of my house.
- Done!

678
00:31:07,551 --> 00:31:09,085
Thanks.

679
00:31:13,857 --> 00:31:15,725
Hey.

680
00:31:15,726 --> 00:31:17,026
Are you all right?

681
00:31:17,027 --> 00:31:20,963
You can't touch me at work,

682
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,632
not in front of people,

683
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:25,801
like we're together or something.

684
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:28,570
Like we're together?

685
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:30,906
Right. Well, maybe we should
just stop while we're ahead.

686
00:31:30,907 --> 00:31:32,241
No. I'm just saying...

687
00:31:32,242 --> 00:31:35,477
I know you want to keep things
professional, but my feelings...

688
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:41,416
my feelings for you
are not professional, not at all.

689
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:45,688
So... I'm calling this.

690
00:31:54,264 --> 00:31:55,864
Where are you going?

691
00:31:55,865 --> 00:31:57,532
To see my patient.

692
00:31:57,533 --> 00:32:00,201
- Well, I just did, and he's fine.
- Well, if it's all the same to you...

693
00:32:00,202 --> 00:32:01,936
No, it's not.

694
00:32:01,937 --> 00:32:03,738
He's stable. Grey has him.

695
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:06,607
You can just walk away...
walk very far away, in fact.

696
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:08,043
Owen, listen.

697
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,379
I've already seen ma.

698
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,748
Okay? We talked. She...

699
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:16,450
Let me make this more clear.

700
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:18,519
Stay the hell away from my family.

701
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,056
It's my family, too.

702
00:32:28,063 --> 00:32:31,899
No, it's not. It's not your family.
It is mine.

703
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:43,852
So, just use the crutches
until it doesn't hurt to walk.

704
00:32:43,853 --> 00:32:46,223
It's not the walking
I'm worried about.

705
00:32:46,224 --> 00:32:47,892
It's the sitting.

706
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:50,060
Well, when your sitting
improves, um...

707
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:52,562
I wonder if you'd like to get
a cup of coffee.

708
00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:54,030
Charlotte!

709
00:32:55,199 --> 00:32:59,202
Alice. Honey, I told you I was fine.

710
00:32:59,203 --> 00:33:00,904
I know, but then you didn't
pick up your phone,

711
00:33:00,905 --> 00:33:02,406
and I thought...
You're okay, right?

712
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:03,907
- You're okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

713
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:07,277
I'm okay, I promise.

714
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:09,913
This is Dr. Robbins.

715
00:33:09,914 --> 00:33:12,215
She patched up my butt.

716
00:33:12,216 --> 00:33:13,383
Thank you.

717
00:33:13,384 --> 00:33:15,385
Thank you.
She has a really good butt.

718
00:33:15,386 --> 00:33:17,487
Yeah, she... um, you're welcome.

719
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:30,400
You flew?

720
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:32,735
I crashed.

721
00:33:39,443 --> 00:33:43,212
- Hey. Thank you.
- Okay. Thank you.

722
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,289
Hey. You want help?

723
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,325
No, I don't need help.

724
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,460
I know you don't need it.

725
00:34:07,603 --> 00:34:10,538
You debrided, irrigated,
and cleaned all these burns?

726
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:11,940
Yeah. Despite what some people think,

727
00:34:11,941 --> 00:34:13,307
I know what the hell I'm doing.

728
00:34:13,308 --> 00:34:14,375
I know y...

729
00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:17,479
I'm not saying you're not
a good doctor. I'm...

730
00:34:24,653 --> 00:34:27,355
I'm sorry for everything.

731
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:31,292
We started out together, and you just blew
right past me. I started to think that...

732
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:33,327
Jo, if they don't see what a good
surgeon you are, it's not your fault.

733
00:34:33,328 --> 00:34:34,462
It's theirs.

734
00:34:41,136 --> 00:34:43,570
I'm sorry, too.

735
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:47,074
I miss you.

736
00:34:49,511 --> 00:34:50,744
Me too.

737
00:34:55,817 --> 00:34:57,985
You did well today, doctor.

738
00:34:57,986 --> 00:35:00,254
44 patients, 19 critical.

739
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:01,889
You lost only one.

740
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:04,392
Then why do I only <i>feel the one?</i>

741
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,893
That's the job.

742
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:07,694
"That's the job."

743
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:12,866
Uh, it appears my doctors
are punching each other.

744
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:14,601
There's always a fire to put out.

745
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:18,839
Same place?

746
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,076
I've been dreaming about
those jalapeno poppers.

747
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:24,645
Ah!

748
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:30,417
April! April, come on!

749
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:32,285
Stop, damn it! Come on.

750
00:35:32,286 --> 00:35:33,754
Jackson, I've had a long day.

751
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:35,288
Yeah, we should probably
talk about that.

752
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:37,723
What is there to talk about?
We had sex. That's it.

753
00:35:37,724 --> 00:35:39,992
That's not it,
and we should talk about that.

754
00:35:41,962 --> 00:35:43,495
Fine.

755
00:35:44,865 --> 00:35:47,700
Fine. Talk about it.

756
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:50,937
- We had sex.
- We had sex.

757
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:52,605
And that was...

758
00:35:52,606 --> 00:35:53,873
- Confusing.
- Amazing.

759
00:35:53,874 --> 00:35:56,042
- Oh, man.
- It was sure, it was also amazing,

760
00:35:56,043 --> 00:35:57,710
- but this is why I...
- See? No! Stop, stop!

761
00:35:57,711 --> 00:35:59,545
I'm not confused about the situation.

762
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:00,880
I know exactly what it was.

763
00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:03,950
Because it was...
it <i>was</i> amazing.

764
00:36:03,951 --> 00:36:05,718
It felt good!

765
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,788
For the first time in forever,
it felt like us!

766
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:11,957
And then... then I saw it.

767
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:14,993
I saw it on your face, Jackson.

768
00:36:14,994 --> 00:36:17,229
This was it.

769
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,998
This was goodbye.

770
00:36:19,999 --> 00:36:21,833
And then I thought,

771
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:24,236
"Well, if we're over,
this is the way to go out."

772
00:36:24,237 --> 00:36:27,306
At least this is
what I want to remember...

773
00:36:27,307 --> 00:36:29,841
the amazing.

774
00:36:29,842 --> 00:36:33,479
I want to end where we began,

775
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,013
in a bed, in love,

776
00:36:35,014 --> 00:36:38,917
and I just want to
keep us there for a minute.

777
00:36:38,918 --> 00:36:42,820
And anything you say right now
is gonna ruin it,

778
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:44,855
so please just don't!

779
00:36:44,856 --> 00:36:45,723
Don't you see?
This is what you do.

780
00:36:45,724 --> 00:36:47,325
You just decide
how things are gonna go.

781
00:36:47,326 --> 00:36:50,495
- I am not the one deciding in this situation!
- Of course you're the one deciding!

782
00:36:50,496 --> 00:36:52,363
- What?!
- April, you're always deciding!

783
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:53,998
You decide to go to Jordan.

784
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:55,866
You decide to leave.
You decide to stay.

785
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:57,835
You decide you need me,
then you decide you don't.

786
00:36:57,836 --> 00:36:59,470
You decide we can talk.
You decide we cannot.

787
00:36:59,471 --> 00:37:02,440
I don't want to talk because
I know what you're gonna say!

788
00:37:02,441 --> 00:37:04,041
You're gonna say
you love me but...

789
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:07,044
- You don't know what I'm going to say!
- I'm pretty sure I do.

790
00:37:07,045 --> 00:37:10,615
- It doesn't matter! You don't!
- Fine! Tt-then go ahead!

791
00:37:10,616 --> 00:37:11,882
Say it.

792
00:37:13,484 --> 00:37:17,053
Oh, my God! Jackson!
God, please, just say it!

793
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,864
I have feelings, too.

794
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,802
Unprofessional ones.

795
00:37:32,803 --> 00:37:34,471
A lot of them.

796
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,041
I like you.

797
00:37:38,042 --> 00:37:40,043
I just...

798
00:37:40,044 --> 00:37:41,744
I just can't like you at work.

799
00:37:41,745 --> 00:37:43,480
It's difficult for me.

800
00:37:43,481 --> 00:37:45,014
O-okay.

801
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:47,984
So can I like you and...

802
00:37:47,985 --> 00:37:49,752
N-not like you at work?

803
00:37:49,753 --> 00:37:51,221
Can you do that?

804
00:37:56,694 --> 00:37:57,827
Lock the door.

805
00:38:22,419 --> 00:38:24,453
I need to talk to you.

806
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:29,925
I need to talk to <i>you.</i>

807
00:38:29,926 --> 00:38:32,094
No, no, no, no, no. Listen.

808
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:37,699
This isn't working.

809
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,069
I need someone in my corner,

810
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:44,106
and the more I look at it,
the only person I have is me.

811
00:38:44,107 --> 00:38:45,941
- Jo...
- And I don't want to make you choose

812
00:38:45,942 --> 00:38:47,542
between me and your friends...

813
00:38:47,543 --> 00:38:49,310
your friend...

814
00:38:49,311 --> 00:38:51,980
but I can't keep feeling
like everyone's second choice,

815
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:55,117
especially not yours.

816
00:38:55,118 --> 00:38:58,053
So, I'm gonna go stay
with Steph for a while.

817
00:38:58,054 --> 00:38:59,320
Jo, stop.

818
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:06,427
Oh, my God. Alex...

819
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,765
Yeah?

820
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:13,735
You suck at proposing!

821
00:39:13,736 --> 00:39:15,336
- What, you don't like it?
- No, it's not... it's...

822
00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:17,505
it's <i>when</i> you do it!

823
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:20,074
Either I'm falling apart,
or you're falling apart,

824
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:23,344
and then you just do
this crazy, sweeping thing.

825
00:39:23,345 --> 00:39:25,980
What, do you think I got this
at the 7-Eleven?

826
00:39:25,981 --> 00:39:28,115
Mer has been holding on to this
for a month

827
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,851
so you wouldn't see it
in my freaking underwear drawer.

828
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:32,687
All day, she's been trying
to pass it off to me

829
00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:33,588
without you seeing it.

830
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:35,490
You think this
will make everything okay,

831
00:39:35,491 --> 00:39:36,857
but you don't listen.

832
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:38,660
I <i>am</i> listening.

833
00:39:38,661 --> 00:39:40,328
You're saying you need someone
in your corner.

834
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:42,696
I-I'm right here, Jo.

835
00:39:42,697 --> 00:39:44,298
I'm in your corner.

836
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:49,703
I've been thinking about tonight
every day since I left that jewelry store.

837
00:39:49,704 --> 00:39:51,105
I would have asked you sooner,

838
00:39:51,106 --> 00:39:52,940
but this was the first day
on the schedule

839
00:39:52,941 --> 00:39:54,374
that I thought you'd even be home.

840
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:57,011
Tonight was the night...
is the night.

841
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:03,150
I've been listening,
and I'm listening now.

842
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,351
I love you.

843
00:40:07,707 --> 00:40:09,223
Yes or no?

844
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:14,128
<i>When we strike that match,</i>

845
00:40:14,129 --> 00:40:16,563
<i>we like to think</i>
<i>we can control the burn.</i>

846
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:32,379
Hell of a day, huh?

847
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,215
Can I have a whiskey,
please? Neat.

848
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:37,217
Sure. Coming right up.

849
00:40:37,218 --> 00:40:38,284
Can I get you one?

850
00:40:38,285 --> 00:40:41,087
<i>We like to think</i>
<i>we have any control at all.</i>

851
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:42,489
No.

852
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:48,962
A vodka tonic.

853
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:53,066
Vodka tonic.

854
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:54,334
Yeah, right away.

855
00:40:57,671 --> 00:41:00,039
Here you go.

856
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,075
Thank you.

857
00:41:02,076 --> 00:41:03,209
Cheers.

858
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,123
<i>But fire is wildly difficult to contain.</i>

859
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,727
<i>And just when you think</i>
<i>you've extinguished the blaze...</i>

860
00:41:26,232 --> 00:41:29,301
All right, we'll load it up.

861
00:41:29,302 --> 00:41:33,238
- Bailey's looking for you.
- Okay.

862
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:36,141
You have to pull it together.

863
00:41:36,142 --> 00:41:39,211
- You're getting yourself in trouble.
- I know.

864
00:41:39,212 --> 00:41:40,713
<i>...it reignites.</i>

865
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:42,381
<i>It sucks in air,</i>

866
00:41:42,382 --> 00:41:46,485
<i>and it burns hotter</i>
<i>and brighter than ever.</i>

867
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,658
You never told me you had a sister.

868
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:08,841

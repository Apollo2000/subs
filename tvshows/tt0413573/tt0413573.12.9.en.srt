1
00:00:05,983 --> 00:00:07,652
Now...

2
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:10,663
Who can tell me the steps
of a partial laryngectomy?

3
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:11,913
<i>In group settings,</i>

4
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:15,435
<i>men are 75% more likely
to speak up than women,</i>

5
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:18,424
<i>and when a woman does speak
up, it's statistically probable</i>

6
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:21,875
<i>her male counterparts
will either interrupt her</i>

7
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:23,528
<i>or speak over her.</i>

8
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,020
<i>It's not because they're rude.</i>

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,197
Cross.

10
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,544
<i>It's science. The female
voice is scientifically proven</i>

11
00:00:29,664 --> 00:00:32,484
<i>to be more difficult for
a male brain to register.</i>

12
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:33,870
<i>What does this mean?</i>

13
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,800
<i>It means in this world,</i>

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,291
<i>where men are bigger, stronger, faster,</i>

15
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:41,705
<i>if you're not ready to fight,</i>

16
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:43,096
<i>the silence will kill you.</i>

17
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:44,589
(Horns honking) (Indistinct shouting)

18
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:45,891
This is killing me.

19
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:48,757
We have not moved in 10 minutes.

20
00:00:48,877 --> 00:00:49,965
(Sighs) (Bee buzzing)

21
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:53,482
I swear that Bumblebee has
passed this car twice already.

22
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:55,481
It passed us, it circled the earth,

23
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:57,173
and then came back
around to pass us again.

24
00:00:57,293 --> 00:00:59,500
Yeah, because we left
late because you overslept.

25
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,150
Not fun when you're driving

26
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,919
- and someone makes you late.
- If you want to stay up all night

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,420
screwing around with
some dude, I don't care,

28
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,712
till you spend all morning
complaining about it in my car.

29
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:08,119
I don't know what you're talking about.

30
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,012
We share a wall.

31
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:11,574
So move out!

32
00:01:11,694 --> 00:01:13,598
Nobody told you you could
crash in Amelia's room, anyway!

33
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:16,383
Okay, it's not Amelia's room anymore.

34
00:01:16,503 --> 00:01:19,064
- What is that? Two fire trucks?
- And three ambulances.

35
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:21,716
That's got to be like a
four or five-car pileup.

36
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:25,355
50 bucks says a big rig's involved.

37
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:30,246
- Hey. Hey! That's not a good idea.
- Let's go, Karev.

38
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:32,448
Screw it.

39
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:35,618
(Sirens wailing)

40
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:43,099
(Man screaming)

41
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:44,680
Keps, I could use
another set of hands here.

42
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,196
I'm on it.

43
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:47,595
(Screaming continues)

44
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:49,937
We've been paging you for half an hour.

45
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:51,463
I've been a little busy.

46
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:57,019
We got a 45-year-old
male with a head lac,

47
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:58,994
positive LOC on the scene.

48
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:00,702
Also has abdominal contusion.

49
00:02:00,822 --> 00:02:03,084
I'd like to say it's not
as bad as it looks, but...

50
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:04,937
Major pileup, multiple wounds.

51
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:06,452
A big rig flipped. Bigger mess.

52
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:08,278
Do you think he has
intra-abdominal injury?

53
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:09,438
Well, there's one way to find out.

54
00:02:09,558 --> 00:02:10,880
All right, let's get her inside.

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,367
I got this. Go.

56
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:24,168
A bony deformity in the temporal region.

57
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:26,429
- 5 centimeter head lac.
- Abdomen's clear.

58
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:28,740
Palpable pulses in all four extremities.

59
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,823
We've got mild pupillary asymmetry.

60
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,106
We need to get a head C.T.

61
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:33,327
- Let's page Neuro.
- Mm-hmm.

62
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:35,915
Starting to regret taking
that tour of the city today.

63
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:36,952
(Groans)

64
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:39,700
No rain. Thought it was a good idea.

65
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,325
- I got more than I bargained for.
- Yeah, hey, Dr. Warren here.

66
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:43,937
Well, you did hit your
head pretty good, Lou...

67
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:45,311
but we're gonna get you fixed up.

68
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,046
Wasn't my most graceful landing, either.

69
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,347
Yeah, sure.

70
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:51,802
Pushing 150 of fentanyl. This
should help with the pain.

71
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,773
You know they had a
wall at Pike's Market

72
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:55,853
covered in people's chewing gum?

73
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:58,635
I do, in fact, know
that, Lou. I grew up here.

74
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:00,339
- Mm.
- Thanks.

75
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:01,522
(Sighs)

76
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:03,865
- Where's Neuro?
- Paged. No response.

77
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:05,902
Well, then go get them.

78
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:07,418
(Sighs)

79
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:10,529
- Any pain here, Lou?
- Just a little sore.

80
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,443
- A little sore?
- (Groans)

81
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:14,334
- He's lost his pulse!
- (Groans)

82
00:03:14,454 --> 00:03:16,324
- All right, cover your ears.
- Why?

83
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:17,866
(Bone cracks) (Screams)

84
00:03:17,986 --> 00:03:20,701
- That's why.
- I want hourly Neuro checks on bed 6,

85
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:22,200
sign off on beds 4 and 8.

86
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,513
- Bed 7.
- What?

87
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,578
Bed 7. We don't have a patient in bed 8.

88
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:28,029
Right. So busy in
here, who can remember?

89
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:29,110
(Pager buzzes)

90
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,999
- We're being paged to...
- Trauma 1.

91
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:33,297
- Dr. Grey.
- And Trauma 3. Dr. Hunt.

92
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:36,090
Both urgent, not critical.
Do want Hunt first or Grey?

93
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,311
- Dr. Grey told me to come find you.
- Really?

94
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:41,559
Meredith actually asked for me, or
did she just want Neuro in general?

95
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,247
I... I don't remember.

96
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:44,243
Yeah, you do.

97
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:47,165
Have Grey give us a page if
her patient becomes critical.

98
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:49,906
- Where's Hunt? Trauma 3, right?
- 3.

99
00:03:50,423 --> 00:03:52,471
We'll be there in less than 10 minutes.

100
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:53,960
Dr. Warren, some help over here, please.

101
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,426
Coming through!

102
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:56,725
(Gasping)

103
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,927
I need O2 tanks over here for transport.

104
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:00,946
We're out here visiting my sister.

105
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,646
She and my kids are on a girls' day out.

106
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:05,972
So I decided to go see the Space Needle.

107
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,011
Now I'm seeing all kinds of needles.

108
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:10,072
(Laughs)

109
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:13,532
Yeah, it's corny. I know. Sorry.

110
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,351
My daughters tell me
I make the worst jokes.

111
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:18,525
How many kids do you have?

112
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:20,171
Two.

113
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:22,255
- They're 10 and 6.
- Aww. Sweet.

114
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,181
And they are smart, man.

115
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:25,316
(Chuckles)

116
00:04:25,436 --> 00:04:27,357
They're smarter than I...

117
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:29,864
- Whoa!
- Okay.

118
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:31,265
What are we looking at?

119
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:33,621
- Um...
- Come on, speak up!

120
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,965
- A tonic clonic seizure.
- That's right. Let's roll him.

121
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:37,657
1, 2, 3.

122
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:40,546
- Okay, what do we do now?
- We wait for it to pass.

123
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,408
We wait for it to pass.

124
00:04:44,537 --> 00:04:45,434
It's going on too long.

125
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:48,588
We need 10 of lorazepam. It's
locked in Pharma. Go... now.

126
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,686
It's okay, Lou. I got you.

127
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:58,123
(Exhales slowly)

128
00:04:58,243 --> 00:04:59,534
Ooh.

129
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:01,372
That was a big one.

130
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:04,645
Okay.

131
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,458
Okay.

132
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,090
Okay.

133
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,286
All right.

134
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,288
Oh. He's gonna need a
new gown and fresh sheets.

135
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:19,603
Oh, I hate it when they do that.

136
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:22,117
- Could you get an orderly? Do you mind?
- Okay.

137
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:32,847
- Be right back.
- Okay, hey, there's no rush,

138
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:35,737
but if you do see Neuro,
get them up here, please.

139
00:06:55,663 --> 00:06:57,009
Lou.

140
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:00,015
Lou.

141
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:02,776
You need to lay down.
You shouldn't be up. Lou.

142
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:03,991
(Moaning)

143
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:05,695
Let's get back on the bed, Lou.

144
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:07,492
- (Grunts)
- Mm!

145
00:07:07,612 --> 00:07:08,882
(Grunts)

146
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:10,429
(Grunts)

147
00:07:10,549 --> 00:07:11,966
Ugh! Aah!

148
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,287
(Both grunting)

149
00:07:17,806 --> 00:07:21,505
- Coming through!
- I need that chest X-ray!

150
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:24,497
V-fib, charge to 300.

151
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:26,168
Charged.

152
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:28,016
All right. All right, ready?

153
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:30,273
- Clear!
- (Beeping)

154
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,927
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

155
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,858
Right. Clear!

156
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:37,349
(Beeping)

157
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:39,448
Come on.

158
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:41,287
(Flatline continues)

159
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,836
Okay. I'm calling it.

160
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:51,334
Time of death... 11:42.

161
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:55,305
Crap.

162
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:57,683
I really thought we had him.

163
00:07:58,268 --> 00:08:00,329
Yeah, me too.

164
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,231

166
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:01,360
I need some help in here now!

167
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:05,880
Trauma panel. Send
blood for a crossmatch.

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,983
- Belly is soft.
- Bruising on the left chest.

169
00:09:08,103 --> 00:09:10,369
- Decreased breath sounds on the left.
- Art line is going in.

170
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:12,877
Pulse ox is down to 88.

171
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:14,823
For a trauma series.
Hook up those monitors.

172
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:16,075
We need a wide bore I.V.

173
00:09:16,195 --> 00:09:19,116
Get Ortho here. Add some
left arm and leg films.

174
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:21,546
- Has anyone told the chief?
- Okay, do not page her.

175
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,430
This is one patient. We
can do this one, okay?

176
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,719
She has to handle everything else.

177
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,799
The guy who did this... he
was stable, non-aggressive.

178
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,931
He wasn't a threat. I left for
like five minutes, and this happens.

179
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:32,136
He was postictal.

180
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:33,837
Hyper-aggression can
occur after a seizure.

181
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:35,310
Temporary fugue state.

182
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,143
- He won't even remember it.
- Where is he now?

183
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:40,257
Restrained, and being
treated right next door.

184
00:09:40,377 --> 00:09:41,614
(Door opens)

185
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:43,269
(Sighs)

186
00:09:43,845 --> 00:09:46,814
- Her vein's collapsed. I can't get in.
- Put in a central line.

187
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,857
- I got it.
- Oh, okay.

188
00:09:49,295 --> 00:09:52,709
Obvious dislocation of the left elbow.

189
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:55,317
We got some left knee swelling.

190
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:57,480
Rib fractures on the left
with palpable crepitus.

191
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,908
- Get Ortho here.
- Get a blood gas from the art line.

192
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:02,703
- We need a wide bore I.V.
- No obvious flail.

193
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,432
(Heart beating)

194
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:09,094
(No audio)

195
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,383
- Damn it.
- Send for a trauma panel and a cross.

196
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:13,778
Somebody get Jackson in here right now!

197
00:10:13,898 --> 00:10:14,625
- Grey.
- On it.

198
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:17,130
Grey, we're gonna shoot
a quick X-ray, all right?

199
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,861
Hi. I'm here.

200
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:22,548
(No audio)

201
00:10:36,155 --> 00:10:38,031
1, 2, 3, easy.

202
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:39,908
- (Screams)
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.

203
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:41,076
Okay. Easy.

204
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:43,259
All right, okay. All
right, everybody back.

205
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:44,640
(Groans)

206
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,298
Okay. All right, ready? On three.

207
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:48,097
1, 2, 3.

208
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:49,445
(Screams)

209
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,624
All right, easy.

210
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:52,304
- No, no, no, no.
- Meredith, it's okay.

211
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:54,815
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

212
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,148
It's okay.

213
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:57,759
We're here. What have we...

214
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,725
Possible concussion, head contusions,

215
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:02,393
multiple blunt-force
blows to the head and neck.

216
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:05,148
It's... it's Grey. I'm
sorry. I thought you knew.

217
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:06,809
Dr. Shepherd?

218
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:08,365
(Monitor beeping rapidly)

219
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:10,239
Dr. Shepherd.

220
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,345
Dr. Shepherd!

221
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:15,744
- Here's the films.
- Okay. Pressure's 90 over 60.

222
00:11:15,864 --> 00:11:17,245
She's got a 30% pneumo.

223
00:11:17,365 --> 00:11:18,665
- No obvious effusion.
- She needs a chest tube.

224
00:11:18,785 --> 00:11:21,229
I need a 36 tube,
Betadine, and 6 1/2 gloves.

225
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:23,288
Set up the pleurovac.

226
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:25,221
(Heart beating)

227
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,068
Just got labs. Crit is stable.

228
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:32,456
Oh, good. Draw blood
gas from the a-line.

229
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:34,628
- What is this? What the hell happened?
- She was attacked by a patient.

230
00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:37,438
The neck is bruised and swollen.
She needs an airway evaluation.

231
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:38,407
All right, I'm on it, I'm on it.

232
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:40,861
No bony deformity.
Positive battle's sign.

233
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:42,754
Okay, Meredith, we're gonna have
to put in a chest tube, all right?

234
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:44,353
Your lung is collapsing.

235
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:46,507
(No audio)

236
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:50,870
And this is gonna burn.
I'm injecting the Lido.

237
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,316
You can't work on your family.

238
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:53,731
Everybody in this damn
room is her family.

239
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:56,299
- It's fine.
- Here we go.

240
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:58,118
(Meredith groans)

241
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:02,517
(Gasps, coughs)

242
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:05,117
- Breathe, Mer, breathe. Breathe.
- Chest tube is in.

243
00:12:05,237 --> 00:12:07,057
Okay, easy, easy, easy. Easy, easy.

244
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:09,862
Pulse ox is coming back up. 88, 90.

245
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:15,385
No evidence of traumatic brain injury.

246
00:12:15,505 --> 00:12:17,709
No... no focal deficits.

247
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:18,756
Uh, except...

248
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:22,351
uh, uh, Dr. Grey, I need you
to move your fingers for me.

249
00:12:24,902 --> 00:12:26,445
Or your toes.

250
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:31,230
Come on. Just come on. wiggle something.

251
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,004
She responded to the painful stimulus.

252
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:35,923
- It doesn't make sense...
- Pulse ox is dropping again.

253
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:37,281
Unless...

254
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:40,480
- The chest tube has a small air leak.
- No, she has mild sub-Q emphysema.

255
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,453
We need to secure this
airway and tube her.

256
00:12:42,573 --> 00:12:44,146
- Got it.
- Guys.

257
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:45,467
Guys. I don't think she can hear us.

258
00:12:45,587 --> 00:12:46,915
- What?
- Are you sure?

259
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:48,789
No. Mer.

260
00:12:54,103 --> 00:12:56,887
I see evidence of barotrauma,
possibly from the blows.

261
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:58,060
I think Karev might be right.

262
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,727
I don't think she can
hear anything we're saying.

263
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,520
Her jaw is locked.

264
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,959
- Suction!
- Suction.

265
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,397
Can we take a look?

266
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:08,264
All right. Let me see.
Yeah, yeah, easy, easy.

267
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:10,226
Yeah, we've got a dislocation
here, possible fracture.

268
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:11,634
There's no way we're
getting a tube in there.

269
00:13:11,754 --> 00:13:14,662
You have to get a tube in. You
have to preserve her airway.

270
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:15,815
Or we have to trach her.

271
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:17,825
No, no, no. Um... All
right, wait a second.

272
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:19,489
If I can reduce the dislocation,

273
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:21,381
we can probably get her mouth
open just enough to intubate.

274
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,665
It's gonna hurt like hell, though.

275
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:24,855
Okay. Hang tight.

276
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:27,228
I'm sorry. Here. Okay, Mer.

277
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,829
Okay, we're gonna have to
pop your jaw open, okay?

278
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:31,727
I'm sorry. I know. But we have to do it.

279
00:13:31,847 --> 00:13:34,903
And we're gonna do this on the
count of three, you guys. Ready? 1...

280
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:36,520
2...

281
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,111
Aah!

282
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:03,679
(No audio)

283
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:49,390

00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:16,250
(No audio)

285
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:21,966
(No audio)

286
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:03,717
(No audio)

287
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,591
(No audio)

288
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:31,582
Hey.

289
00:20:31,702 --> 00:20:33,603
What's wrong, Meredith?

290
00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:47,680
Hey.

291
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,550
Just get it out, get it all out.

292
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,171
(Crying)

293
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,094
The tears, all the...

294
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,213
God, you've got a lot of snot.

295
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:22,583
(Laughs)

296
00:21:22,703 --> 00:21:23,992
I'm serious. I'm for real.

297
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:26,788
I mean, you might have
a serious condition.

298
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,264
Come on, woman. Blow your damn nose.

299
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,895
Hang on.

300
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:35,585
Mer.

301
00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:38,463
(Snapping fingers) Can you hear me?

302
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:40,878
- Mm-hmm.
- You can hear me?

303
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:43,293
- Mm-hmm.
- You can hear me?

304
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:44,817
- Mm-hmm.
- (Laughs)

305
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,037
(Laughing) Oh, my God.

306
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:48,762
Oh.

307
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:51,486
(Both laugh)

308
00:21:57,587 --> 00:22:00,368
It is important that you
continue the voice rest, okay?

309
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:02,431
Your tracheal injury is not...

310
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:04,572
fully healed, and your latest audiometry

311
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:07,066
shows that the hearing in your right ear

312
00:22:07,186 --> 00:22:09,726
has almost completely returned.

313
00:22:09,846 --> 00:22:12,492
On your left, you're looking
at about 55%, which is good.

314
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:13,897
It's only been a few weeks, you know,

315
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:15,759
so I'm not concerned about it.

316
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:18,855
It's gonna come back, Meredith, okay?

317
00:22:18,975 --> 00:22:20,950
- (Loudly) I want you to continue to...
- Mm.

318
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,003
(Softly) I want you to continue to
move your fingers while in the cast,

319
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:26,370
and you will remain
non-weight-bearing on your leg

320
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,987
until we take the cast off.

321
00:22:28,107 --> 00:22:31,136
Yeah, there's a little
swelling in that left leg.

322
00:22:31,256 --> 00:22:33,390
It's probably local edema,

323
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,841
but I've ordered a
doppler just to be safe.

324
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:38,154
- Anything else?
- No.

325
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,564
_

326
00:22:45,684 --> 00:22:47,291
Lou? What's... who's Lou?

327
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:49,524
The patient who attacked Meredith.

328
00:22:49,644 --> 00:22:50,894
I've been calling him something else.

329
00:22:51,014 --> 00:22:54,476
Look, we don't have to
go into that right now.

330
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:57,936
She wants to know. Tell her.

331
00:22:58,765 --> 00:23:03,325
Okay. Lou suffered a severe
epidural hematoma in the accident.

332
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:04,924
It's what caused the seizure.

333
00:23:05,044 --> 00:23:09,481
We think he was in a postictal*
state when he attacked.

334
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,436
After a few minutes,

335
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,561
he woke up and had no
idea what he had done.

336
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:17,039
He had surgery and was discharged.

337
00:23:17,518 --> 00:23:20,271
He's doing fine. (Clears throat)

338
00:23:22,949 --> 00:23:24,759
Lou has reached out.

339
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:27,323
He has made a couple
of requests to see you.

340
00:23:27,443 --> 00:23:28,940
- Mnh-mnh.
- I think...

341
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,197
he would just like to apologize.

342
00:23:31,317 --> 00:23:32,974
It's okay.

343
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:36,988
She's kicking us out. Let's go.

344
00:23:38,781 --> 00:23:40,956
- (Clears throat)
- Go ahead.

345
00:23:41,076 --> 00:23:42,343
(Whiteboard squeaking)

346
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:45,848
- Apologize? Are you serious?
- Of course I'm serious.

347
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,393
Yeah, I don't see why.

348
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:50,081
Because the last time that woman
got hurt working for this hospital,

349
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:52,804
she purchased this
hospital. That is why.

350
00:23:52,924 --> 00:23:55,658
And what do you think will
happen if she sees him again?

351
00:23:55,778 --> 00:23:58,030
- Nothing good.
- Exactly.

352
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,827
(Thunder crashes)

353
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:43,008
(Thunder rumbles)

354
00:24:49,331 --> 00:24:51,864
Good, good.

355
00:24:54,716 --> 00:24:57,136
All right. Try and lift your leg for me.

356
00:24:57,256 --> 00:24:59,706
Good, good. Decent mobility.

357
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:06,876
I don't know.

358
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:09,217
Well, we're done, and
it's all good, so...

359
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:11,724
- Thanks.
- (Clears throat)

360
00:25:13,098 --> 00:25:16,653
Uh, he has been working
a lot of night shifts,

361
00:25:16,773 --> 00:25:18,599
and she's been...

362
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,570
They haven't been
talking, I don't think,

363
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,773
or hanging or anything,
from what I can tell.

364
00:25:24,893 --> 00:25:26,869
So, anyway...

365
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:29,002
- Let's do this again.
- (Sighs)

366
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:31,199
Follow the pen.

367
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,901
(Laughs)

368
00:25:34,896 --> 00:25:37,442
Okay, this isn't
exactly the right shade,

369
00:25:37,562 --> 00:25:39,478
but it's doing a pretty good
job of covering the bruising.

370
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,577
(Inhales deeply) All right.

371
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,342
So...

372
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,367
Don't try and get up, okay?

373
00:25:46,487 --> 00:25:48,759
Just let them come to you.

374
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:49,813
And smile.

375
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:52,469
But try not to open your mouth

376
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:54,332
because it's still
pretty swollen in there

377
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:57,337
and the wires... the metal wires...

378
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,574
they're a little scary.

379
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,859
You ready? Okay, all right.

380
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:13,772
Hey, hey, hey! Look who's here, guys!

381
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:16,797
Your mommy is so excited
to see you! Come here.

382
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:19,680
Come on in. Go ahead. Go tell her.
Tell her what we talked about, okay?

383
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,568
- I don't want to.
- Oh, come on, Zola.

384
00:26:22,688 --> 00:26:24,858
You ask me every day,
"when can we go see Mommy?"

385
00:26:24,978 --> 00:26:26,835
Look. She's right over there.

386
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:29,368
- Go give her a big hug!
- No!

387
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,397
No, no, no!

388
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:34,064
(Muffled) Zo-Zo, come see Mommy.

389
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:36,859
- I want to go.
- Come on.

390
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:38,745
(Speaking indistinctly)

391
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:40,865
(Muffled) Zo-zo, come
see Mommy, honey. Come on!

392
00:26:40,985 --> 00:26:43,349
(Ellis crying) Zo-Zo!
Come see Mommy, honey!

393
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:44,768
Come on, honey!

394
00:26:44,802 --> 00:26:47,044
Come on, Zo!

395
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,388
Come on, honey. Please.

396
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:50,406
Zola, come on.

397
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,256
- Lets go talk to her.
- You know... you know what?

398
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:54,255
- Let's do this later. It's not...
- No, no.

399
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,579
Let's do this later. It's not okay.

400
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,691
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

401
00:26:58,811 --> 00:27:00,706
Come on, come on. Let's do this later.

402
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:04,457
Let's do this later. We're
gonna do it later, okay?

403
00:27:04,577 --> 00:27:06,664
We're gonna do it later. Okay.

404
00:27:06,784 --> 00:27:10,226
Okay, does anybody want anything
yummy from the cafeteria?

405
00:27:10,346 --> 00:27:11,925
All right.

406
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:15,239
Zola!

407
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:18,642
(Crying)

408
00:27:21,613 --> 00:27:23,914
(Groans)

409
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:24,777
(Knock on door)

410
00:27:24,897 --> 00:27:27,716
- Dr. Robbins wanted...
- (muffled) Come in here!

411
00:27:27,836 --> 00:27:29,932
- Get in here!
- Dr. Grey. Okay, okay.

412
00:27:30,052 --> 00:27:30,977
- Okay.
- I can't breathe!

413
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:34,478
Okay, you're okay. Hang on, hang
on. Deep breath. Deep breath.

414
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:36,026
I need you to breathe for me.

415
00:27:36,146 --> 00:27:37,325
Breathe for me, Dr. Grey.

416
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:38,579
Breathe.

417
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,045
(Whimpering)

418
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:41,499
- Stay still.
- (Coughs)

419
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,949
Stay still. I'm gonna get you some air.

420
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:47,084
Just stay still. I'm
gonna open you up, okay?

421
00:27:47,204 --> 00:27:48,727
Okay. I'm opening you up.

422
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:50,486
Stay still. Please.

423
00:27:50,606 --> 00:27:51,892
- (Groaning)
- Okay.

424
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,243
(Groaning)

425
00:27:55,363 --> 00:27:57,322
(Breathing heavily)

426
00:27:58,934 --> 00:28:00,483
Okay.

427
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,167
Hold on.

428
00:28:02,578 --> 00:28:04,541
(Breathing heavily)

429
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:06,343
All right. Good.

430
00:28:06,463 --> 00:28:08,175
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

431
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:10,157
She... she was having a panic
attack. She couldn't breathe.

432
00:28:10,277 --> 00:28:12,316
Do you not realize how
delicate the jaw actually is?

433
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:14,837
You could jeopardize the
entire healing process here.

434
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:16,767
She couldn't breathe! Look at her!

435
00:28:16,887 --> 00:28:19,364
She's been stuck in this
room in that bed for weeks.

436
00:28:19,484 --> 00:28:21,260
She can't move. She can't talk.

437
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,062
But I'm her surgeon now, right?

438
00:28:23,182 --> 00:28:24,778
You can't come in here and
just take out her wires.

439
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:26,649
She is my patient.

440
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:28,900
I know what I am doing!

441
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,235
You can rewire her jaw tomorrow morning,

442
00:28:31,355 --> 00:28:32,703
but right now, she needed some air,

443
00:28:32,823 --> 00:28:35,128
so I got her some damn air!

444
00:28:35,248 --> 00:28:38,528
(Panting)

445
00:28:46,322 --> 00:28:48,804
- I brought you something to eat...
- Drink.

446
00:28:48,924 --> 00:28:51,182
- Mm.
- I know. I'm sorry.

447
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,468
Morning!

448
00:28:54,188 --> 00:28:56,748
- Oh, come on.
- Or not.

449
00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:00,102
How's the pain today?

450
00:29:00,902 --> 00:29:01,767
(Thuds)

451
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:03,507
- And the discomfort?
- (Thuds loudly)

452
00:29:03,627 --> 00:29:04,747
Well, her energy's up.

453
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:05,821
All right. I'm sorry.

454
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:08,116
I have all of five minutes to
update you on the miracle...

455
00:29:08,236 --> 00:29:10,667
That I've been working
on your service this week,

456
00:29:10,787 --> 00:29:13,130
but it seems like a bad time.

457
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,703
Uh, I'm gonna check in
and update you later.

458
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:19,987
Maybe we all could check in later.

459
00:29:21,537 --> 00:29:22,748
Yeah.

460
00:29:24,453 --> 00:29:26,367
I'm just gonna...

461
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:28,837
Leave that.

462
00:29:38,724 --> 00:29:40,423
(Thudding)

463
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:48,162
Whoa. What happened?

464
00:29:48,282 --> 00:29:49,799
Everything okay?

465
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:54,187
(Telephone rings) Nurses station.

466
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:56,924
Yeah, okay. I got it. You
don't want to look at me.

467
00:29:57,044 --> 00:29:58,450
I get it.

468
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:03,212
Do you think that I want to be out there

469
00:30:03,332 --> 00:30:04,619
hanging out outside your door

470
00:30:04,739 --> 00:30:06,386
like some pathetic little
rat looking for scraps?

471
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:08,716
Do you think that feels good for me?

472
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:10,416
I...

473
00:30:10,536 --> 00:30:13,189
I have been out there trying to
figure out how to make amends...

474
00:30:13,424 --> 00:30:16,118
As if that would matter to you.

475
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:28,080
I know I'm a mess...

476
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,102
Who talks too much and feels too much,

477
00:30:30,222 --> 00:30:32,484
and I know that it drives you crazy,

478
00:30:33,012 --> 00:30:35,105
but that is the one way
I know how to stay sober,

479
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:37,811
and every time I try to
suck it up and shut up

480
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:40,782
and just be cold and
normal, I end up drunk...

481
00:30:40,902 --> 00:30:43,135
Or on pills or at a funeral.

482
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,796
Do you know what it felt like
to walk into that trauma room

483
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:52,146
and see you on that
table and think to myself,

484
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:54,062
"great. I did it again.

485
00:30:54,182 --> 00:30:56,048
Here comes another funeral."

486
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,487
(Sighs)

487
00:31:02,064 --> 00:31:04,023
You know what?

488
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,214
Forget it. I...

489
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,427
I don't even know why I came in.

490
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:12,399

491
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:33,501

Look, look, look. I know you're
not in the mood for a lecture.

But... are you finished?

504
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,050
She came to see you the
night after the attack.

505
00:32:38,363 --> 00:32:40,347
She was drunk.

506
00:32:41,702 --> 00:32:43,625
She was upset...

507
00:32:44,387 --> 00:32:49,021
Because you'd called her
for a consult that day...

508
00:32:49,783 --> 00:32:51,904
the day of the attack.

509
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:55,442
And she had a choice
between coming to you

510
00:32:55,735 --> 00:32:58,401
and going to another trauma,

511
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:01,419
and she went to the other trauma

512
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:03,339
because she was mad at you.

513
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:11,497
Forgiveness is a powerful
thing, Meredith...

514
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:17,670
Not only to make the
other person feel good,

515
00:33:18,505 --> 00:33:20,390
but to heal you.

516
00:33:22,952 --> 00:33:25,364
You need to forgive her, Mer.

517
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:30,093
Forgive her for not being Derek...

518
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:34,203
For being the wrong Shepherd...

519
00:33:34,323 --> 00:33:37,657
Just enough to remind
you of what's missing,

520
00:33:37,777 --> 00:33:41,087
but not enough to bring him back.

521
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,464
That's not her fault.

522
00:33:45,012 --> 00:33:47,926
You need to forgive her.

523
00:33:48,912 --> 00:33:50,987
You don't have to like her.

524
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,136
You don't have to love her.

525
00:33:55,624 --> 00:33:57,761
But forgive her, okay?

526
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:03,233
So you can forgive Blake
for being in that room

527
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:06,785
when a wrong decision
cost you your husband.

528
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:14,256
To forgive Derek for dying too soon.

529
00:34:17,187 --> 00:34:19,020
To forgive yourself

530
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,095
for hating him for dying too soon.

531
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:29,706
Let it go, Meredith...

532
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,825
(Sniffles)

533
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,563
and forgive.

535

Sun feels good on the face, doesn't it?

536
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,249
What is the point of counseling, then,

537
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:54,154
if you're just gonna suddenly,
without even talking about it, just...

538
00:34:54,274 --> 00:34:56,337
Oh, come on. All we do is talk, April.

539
00:34:56,457 --> 00:34:58,777
So, what? You just... you
just... just serve me papers?

540
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:02,003
Just like that? Just no
warning, no... no any...

541
00:35:02,123 --> 00:35:04,681
Do you have any idea what
a slap in the face this is?

542
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:10,603
Are you kidding me?

543
00:35:12,814 --> 00:35:14,630
You ready?

544
00:35:31,904 --> 00:35:33,622
Hi, Dr. Grey.

545
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,271
Lou. Um...

546
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:39,219
Thank you for meeting me.

547
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:52,540
This is my wife, Joanne,

548
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,352
my daughter, Kylie.

549
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:58,079
I told you about her...
the youngest, really smart.

550
00:35:59,376 --> 00:36:01,792
And that's my Anne.

551
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:04,092
Um...

552
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,496
Um, have a seat, girls.

553
00:36:06,616 --> 00:36:08,771
Um, you got kids?

554
00:36:11,446 --> 00:36:13,067
Right.

555
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:15,122
Forgot you can't talk.

556
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,387

557
00:36:17,507 --> 00:36:19,272
Um...

558
00:36:22,076 --> 00:36:23,853
I wanted to...

559
00:36:27,115 --> 00:36:29,488
I didn't know what I was doing.

560
00:36:30,415 --> 00:36:31,948
What I did to you...

561
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:35,858
I didn't know.

562
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:37,577
I would never...

563
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:42,432
I would never hurt a woman.

564
00:36:45,256 --> 00:36:46,672
I...

565
00:36:47,392 --> 00:36:49,214
I just want you...

566
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:52,324
I just want you to know that I'm sorry.

567
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:57,832
Truly sorry.

568
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:27,387

569
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:57,104

I'm sober.

00:38:00,563 --> 00:38:03,557
And I'm starting back
at work on Monday, so...

Meredith: I know you are.

00:38:18,486 --> 00:38:20,537
You...

576
00:38:20,657 --> 00:38:22,847
You can talk. That, um...

577
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,593
That's great. They,
uh, took the wires off?

00:38:42,254 --> 00:38:43,785
I'm not...

582

exactly ready, either.

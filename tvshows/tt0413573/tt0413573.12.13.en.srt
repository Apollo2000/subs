Oh, it'll work.

Major Thorpe, your
chief asked for our help

164
00:05:57,376 --> 00:05:58,543
because he knows we're the best.

165
00:05:58,577 --> 00:06:00,078
Now, you called us the Dream Team,

166
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:01,446
and that's exactly what we are.

167
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,313
We are miracle workers.

168
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:04,515
Now, the sooner you recognize that,

169
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,385
the sooner we can get to the
business of saving a life,

170
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:10,321
which is all any of us are
here to do, yourself included.

You think maybe you overdid that?

We've practiced once, Torres... once.

00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:25,130

but if it's slow, I mean,

I could meet you back
here in a couple hours.

Uh, yeah, absolutely.

Are we still doing this?

195
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,512
Yes. Because it's a secret,

196
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:25,014
and that's what you do with secrets...
you keep them secret.

Yeah, but what's the point?

Look, your sisters know, Webber knows.

hard and sacrificed too much

She can't just kick somebody
off the team.

who's in, who's out.

ask, "Off which bridge?"

All she has to do is
sleep with Grey's BFF.

Of course she gets the wonder surgery.

Callie doesn't give me anything.

805

Besides, she was dating Torres

806
00:29:06,256 --> 00:29:08,290
before she even started working here.

807
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:09,825
She's not nailing an
attending to get ahead.

I don't think that's
what's going on here.

809
00:29:11,594 --> 00:29:14,063
Really? Warren's married to the Chief,

810
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:15,564
so he's scrubbed in down
there on a surgery

811
00:29:15,598 --> 00:29:17,032
while we're stuck watching up here.

- Uncool.

I was never like one of those girls.

825

I never fit in the usual molds,

826
00:29:43,093 --> 00:29:46,095
I always did my own
thing, I never wore a hair bow,

827
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:47,763
and I never worried about it.

Mitchell: That the
patient's gonna survive, sir?

838

Well, it means that Dr.
Warren will only be facing suspension

839

Sir, I understand you're upset...

boneheaded stunts is long past...

saving a man's life is boneheaded?

Warren...

844
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,604
Sir, I may be a resident,

845
00:30:28,638 --> 00:30:30,973
but I have been a doctor a lot longer.

846

The other residents love to give me crap

847

about how much older than them I am,

848
00:30:34,477 --> 00:30:36,445
but at the end of the
day, I'm also wiser, too.

849
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:39,615
All right, this wasn't a
stunt. This was a judgment call.

850
00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:42,751
I took a risk, it paid
off, and this man is alive.

851

Now, I understand... I broke rules,

852
00:30:44,254 --> 00:30:47,256
and I need to pay the
price for that, but...

853
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,390
I'm not an idiot.

854
00:30:48,425 --> 00:30:51,260
And I don't deserve to
be spoken to as though I am.

855
00:30:51,294 --> 00:30:54,096
No, what you deserve is
a hell of a lot worse.

856
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,433
What you call a calculated
risk is what I call foolish.

857

Don't confuse the two, Warren.

858
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:01,904
You did not show skill today.

859

You showed bravado, and
that is dangerous.

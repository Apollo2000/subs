1
00:00:05,074 --> 00:00:06,340
There's a reason the punch line

2
00:00:06,408 --> 00:00:08,275
to so many doctor jokes start with,

3
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:10,978
"I've got good news and bad news."

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,012
Bad news.

5
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:14,214
The air-conditioner coil is broken.

6
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:15,415
And?

7
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:17,250
And it's hot.

8
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:19,453
That's all. There is no more.

9
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:21,021
Come on, it's freaking fall already.

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,856
It's global warming already.

11
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,391
Close the fridge.

12
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:25,425
Zola!

13
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:27,060
Can you fix it?

14
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,063
Can I fix it?

15
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:31,732
I am a heart surgeon.

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,400
Right, I can fix anything.

17
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:35,168
No, I fix people.

18
00:00:35,237 --> 00:00:37,371
That's an air conditioner. You fix it.

19
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,373
I don't want to screw up my hands.
I'm a surgeon, too.

20
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:41,141
- Eh.
- What do you mean "Eh"?

21
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,150
- You work in a clinic.
- Shut up.

22
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:44,901
Close the fridge!

23
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:46,714
Can we just get the hell out
of this sweat box already?

24
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:48,849
Gladly. Zola, Bailey!

25
00:00:55,858 --> 00:00:57,992
Often, the bad news is so bad,

26
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,760
when something good comes along,

27
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:01,262
we tend to go a little overboard.

28
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:03,264
It's a glorious day,
is it not, Dr. Grey?

29
00:01:03,332 --> 00:01:05,166
Well, I could do with 20 degrees cooler

30
00:01:05,234 --> 00:01:06,834
and an air-conditioner repairman.

31
00:01:06,903 --> 00:01:08,636
It's the kind of day when people say,

32
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:10,404
"Dr. Bailey, why did you
become a doctor?"

33
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:11,906
you think of a day like this one.

34
00:01:11,974 --> 00:01:13,474
Ask me why it's a glorious day.

35
00:01:13,543 --> 00:01:15,176
Do you really need me
for this conversation?

36
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:17,411
I have a liver transplant for a patient

37
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,647
who's been waiting forever

38
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:20,848
on the UNOS list.

39
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:23,184
Patient is a sweet old grandma.

40
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:26,987
Do you know how many people
pushing 80 get livers, Grey?

41
00:01:27,056 --> 00:01:29,023
Not many people make it
to the top of that list.

42
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,091
Not many people have
Miranda Bailey in their corner,

43
00:01:31,194 --> 00:01:34,161
but this one does, and so today,

44
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,765
I am Ed McMahon with a big check.

45
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:40,634
It's a glorious day.

46
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:48,742
Dr. Reed to Medical Records.
Dr. Reed to Medical Records.

47
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:50,644
Oh, hey, you're back.

48
00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:52,980
Yeah. Of course I'm back.
Why wouldn't I be?

49
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:54,582
No, I mean you're back early.

50
00:01:54,684 --> 00:01:57,284
Uh, nope, 29th. Always been the 29th.

51
00:01:57,386 --> 00:01:58,852
Well, then I have good news for you...

52
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:00,354
you still get three days with your baby

53
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:01,822
because today's the 26th.

54
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:04,458
Uh, nope. 29th, see?

55
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:05,893
Really? Oh, trust me.

56
00:02:05,962 --> 00:02:08,295
I have been looking forward to this day.

57
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:10,564
I-I mean, it's been great
and I love my baby,

58
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:13,434
but, God, I missed work
and talking to people

59
00:02:13,502 --> 00:02:14,586
who can actually talk back.

60
00:02:15,705 --> 00:02:17,404
Talking to yourself is overrated.

61
00:02:18,874 --> 00:02:20,158
Hello?

62
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:22,661
Excuse me.

63
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:26,480
And I'm still talking to myself.

64
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:28,015
Great to have you back, Kepner.

65
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:30,918
- Hey.
- Hey.

66
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:32,953
- Good morning.
- Morning.

67
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:36,123
Edwards. What are you doing?

68
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:37,458
I was inputting data

69
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:39,460
into Dr. Shepherd's
amygdala hijack study.

70
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:42,830
Or you can scrub in with me
on a massive cardiac myxoma.

71
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:45,899
It's a very difficult procedure.
I need the best resident I can get.

72
00:02:45,968 --> 00:02:48,569
I'm sorry. The best resident?

73
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:50,371
How is she the best resident?

74
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,846
You weren't supposed to hear that.

75
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,874
- You up for it?
- How is that a question?

76
00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:54,942
Let's go.

77
00:02:55,011 --> 00:02:57,344
The best resident? What the hell?

78
00:02:57,413 --> 00:02:58,912
Does everyone say that?

79
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:00,648
Come on, define best.

80
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:02,549
DeLuca, you're with me.

81
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:04,652
Oh, Chief, uh, I'm free if you want

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,620
a senior resident over an intern.

83
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:09,056
I need DeLuca. That's why I said DeLuca.

84
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,724
DeLuca, move.

85
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,650
Here. Get up to speed.

86
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:17,398
I think I'm on O.B. today, actually.

87
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:18,499
You're with me now.

88
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:20,234
I can do that. I have power.

89
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:21,902
Okay, that's, uh...

90
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:23,837
oh, wait, am I in trouble?

91
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:26,206
You've had a rough few weeks.

92
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:28,008
I thought you'd like
some unmitigated joy,

93
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:30,511
so today you're going to be Ed McMahon!

94
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:32,369
I-I don't know who that is.

95
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:35,182
Now, see, that makes me feel old.

96
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:37,217
I just said I was giving you joy.

97
00:03:37,286 --> 00:03:39,286
Do you really want to make me feel old

98
00:03:39,355 --> 00:03:40,854
in response to my joy giving?

99
00:03:40,956 --> 00:03:42,489
- Um...
- You think that's wise?

100
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:45,492
Do you think that will make me
more likely to give you joy?

101
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:46,393
N-No.

102
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:49,096
No, DeLuca. No, it will not.

103
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:51,365
You are quite young.

104
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:54,505
I'm a baby, and Ed McMahon is a god.

105
00:03:55,805 --> 00:03:59,373
And here comes the joy.

106
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:03,711
My hero!

107
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:08,782
Now, hold on. Hold on.

108
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:10,918
Let's just make some room
so the doctors can sit.

109
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:12,086
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

110
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:13,520
The poor folks have been
on their feet all day.

111
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:14,421
We're fine.

112
00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:16,156
No, Lily, I'm not taking your seat.

113
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:18,058
Well, then, we're not listening.

114
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:19,927
Oh, come on, rest your doggies.

115
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:23,230
Get over here. All right.

116
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:24,798
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

117
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:31,538
I knew you wouldn't want
to take that off.

118
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:32,906
- Did I tell you?
- You were right.

119
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,043
I'm gonna have something for you, too,

120
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:38,645
but today, my hand's
just a little bit shaky.

121
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:40,147
That's okay. I wasn't really
expecting anything.

122
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:42,816
Well, you're gonna get snickerdoodles

123
00:04:42,885 --> 00:04:44,385
whether you were expecting them or not.

124
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:46,487
- Samantha.
- Oh, yeah.

125
00:04:47,723 --> 00:04:49,256
Ta-da.

126
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:50,357
Thank you.

127
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:51,825
Dr. DeLuca, you want to present?

128
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:54,595
Oh, yes. Um, June Crowley...

129
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:56,897
No, call me Granny June, honey.
Everybody does.

130
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:59,777
Granny June Crowley, class 3, MELD 20,

131
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,735
end stage liver disease,
scheduled to receive

132
00:05:01,804 --> 00:05:05,305
a transplant today after
waiting... wow... three years.

133
00:05:05,374 --> 00:05:06,974
Three years.

134
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:09,109
Donor liver arrives at 16:30.

135
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:12,880
- Hey!
- Whoo! Whoo!

136
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:14,815
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

137
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:17,251
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

138
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:20,053
This time tomorrow,
you are gonna be a new woman.

139
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:21,121
Mm-hmm.

140
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,723
Well, I feel blessed

141
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:25,759
having the world's nicest
doctors taking care of me.

142
00:05:29,758 --> 00:05:31,091
Karen.

143
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:32,633
He's a hottie, right?

144
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:37,137
No, he's a hottie.

145
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:39,807
Oh, my God, Granny, stop.

146
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:45,112
But, yes.

147
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:47,281
So, don't be shy. Give him a hug.

148
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:48,649
Mnh!

149
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,517
Well, heck, I'll give him a hug.

150
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:51,518
See?

151
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:55,222
Granny's gonna get a liver today!

152
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:56,156
- Yes!
- Yes, she is!

153
00:05:56,258 --> 00:05:57,791
Whoo!

154
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,429
How can I help?

155
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:04,498
Uh, Chelsea here took a run
in the triple-digit heat.

156
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,467
Motorists found her collapsed
by the side of the road.

157
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:08,168
Core body temp... 40.2.

158
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:11,071
EKG looks fine.

159
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,506
It's a clear-cut case of heat stroke.

160
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:14,041
She'll need to be cooled down
and admitted.

161
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:15,476
Wilson, call ICU.

162
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:17,711
I'm gonna need CBCs, LFTs,

163
00:06:17,813 --> 00:06:19,012
- and a CK level.
- Okay.

164
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:22,382
We should get myoglobin levels
on blood and urine.

165
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:23,851
Chelsea, we're gonna take you upstairs

166
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,853
and try to get this temp down, okay?

167
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:27,621
Why are all these people here?

168
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,555
Where am I?

169
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:29,556
Chelsea, you're in the hospital.

170
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:30,491
You got a little overheated.

171
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:31,959
Is there someone we can call for you?

172
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:33,126
My sister.

173
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:36,296
She... She's my emergency
contact in my phone.

174
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:38,665
All right, let's get her
on the cooling blanket.

175
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:39,700
I'll grab one.

176
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:41,969
Try to hang in there, Chelsea.

177
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:45,272
Pierce says your air conditioner died.

178
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:47,274
I thought maybe I could help.

179
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,077
You can fix an air conditioner?

180
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:51,979
No. I don't need to.

181
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:53,313
Mine's not broken,

182
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:56,917
and I'm willing to share it
with a colleague in need.

183
00:06:56,986 --> 00:06:58,318
See, I'm... I'm a giver.

184
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,823
See, it's my weak spot.

185
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:02,155
That's not an offer a colleague makes.

186
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:03,423
We're just talking about the weather.

187
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:05,158
Colleagues talk about the weather.

188
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:07,628
You need a cooling blanket.

189
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:14,301
I'm gonna get her.

190
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:27,648
Oh, hi.

191
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:30,284
Hi.

192
00:07:30,352 --> 00:07:31,713
What do you need?

193
00:07:33,255 --> 00:07:34,882
Cooling blankets.

194
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:36,523
What are you doing?

195
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,858
Uh, nothing.

196
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:39,978
Really? 'Cause you look super sketchy.

197
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:42,029
Close the door.

198
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,171
You're not looking for drugs, right?

199
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:53,240
- No. Meredith!
- Oh. Well, I don't know.

200
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:55,909
I mean, I'm supposed to ask
if I care, right?

201
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:57,444
I'm pregnant.

202
00:07:57,513 --> 00:07:58,979
Congratulations!

203
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:01,281
I didn't even know you were trying.
That's wonderful.

204
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,649
We just started.

205
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:04,952
Oh, my goodness,
I'm thrilled for you guys.

206
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,787
Owen must be thrilled.

207
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:08,055
I don't know when to tell him.

208
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:09,823
I, uh, don't want to get
his hopes up until I'm sure.

209
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:12,459
He's really excited about this.

210
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:15,461
You just think you're pregnant?

211
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:18,465
I'm late. I'm never late.

212
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,000
Never.

213
00:08:20,102 --> 00:08:21,802
So, this isn't real?

214
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:25,305
I can't find the freaking
pregnancy tests.

215
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:27,774
Wait. I hugged you and you haven't
even peed on a stick yet?

216
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:29,776
I can't find the sticks.

217
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:36,350
Tell Owen now or later.
That's your call.

218
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:38,685
Tell me when it's real.

219
00:08:57,272 --> 00:08:58,695
Hi.

220
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:00,807
What?

221
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:01,875
Do you have a minute?

222
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:07,881
Oh, hey. Bring a Daughter to Work Day?

223
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,349
Yeah, it's April's first day back,

224
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:11,251
but I got paged for an emergency
hand de-gloving.

225
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:12,719
Guy's got his hand caught
in a metal press.

226
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:15,055
Got to get her to the daycare.
You seen April at all?

227
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:17,557
Uh, I saw her in the pit.

228
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:19,426
Hey, you want me
to take Harriet up there?

229
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:20,827
No, no, I wouldn't ask.

230
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:22,329
Kepner's busy. I'm free.

231
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,264
- I'm happy to help...
- That would be really great, actually.

232
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:26,299
Thank you. Hang on.

233
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:27,234
I just want to get in there

234
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:29,102
'cause this poor guy just came in.

235
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:31,371
Okay, just walk her around
for like 15 minutes

236
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:32,806
- and just get her to sleep, you know...
- Uh-huh. Okay.

237
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:34,675
...before you take her to the daycare.

238
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:36,343
- Thank you so much.
- All right.

239
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:39,613
Did you need me for something?

240
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:41,381
- What?
- I said, did you need me for something?

241
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:43,784
Later. It'll wait.

242
00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:45,652
What?

243
00:09:48,157 --> 00:09:49,256
What is it?

244

245
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:58,653
You can't just steal my resident.

246
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,266
She's a resident, not your resident.

247
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:03,129
The best resident.

248
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:06,430
- Your words.
- She's mine. You can't have her.

249
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:07,431
You can't say that.

250
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:08,933
She doesn't belong to anyone.

251
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:11,102
Also, standing right here.
I can absolutely hear you.

252
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:13,637
That thing you need to do...
you don't need Edwards for that.

253
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:15,473
- So we're good then?
- No, we are not good.

254
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:17,108
- Meredith. What?
- Did you tell Owen yet?

255
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:20,144
I tried to, but he already had a baby.

256
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:22,980
What's going on?

257
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:24,480
She's late.

258
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:26,684
Meredith, Edwards is right here.

259
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:27,718
Oh, now you're aware I can hear you.

260
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:28,953
Oh, my God, you're pregnant?

261
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:30,688
Oh, my God!

262
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,557
No "Oh, my Gods" and no hugging
until she pees on the stick.

263
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:35,593
I'm so happy for you.

264
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:37,528
Can I have Edwards, then?

265
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,798
No. No, you can't.

266
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:43,234
Yes, of course.

267
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:46,837
Hey, hey.

268
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,272
I need to get you into bed.

269
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:49,573
I beg your pardon?

270
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:51,308
You can't leave.
You've barely been hydrated.

271
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,810
I'm surprised you're still on your feet.

272
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:53,911
- Nurse...
- Wait, wait, no.

273
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:56,981
I'm not Chelsea.
I'm Chandler, her sister.

274
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,575
We're twins.

275
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:00,317
Uh. Yes.

276
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:03,487
I... I-I just got that, yeah.

277
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,460
Chelsea, why would you even go
for a run on a day like this?

278
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:11,529
'Cause I'm not a wimp.

279
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:14,899
That would sound cooler
if you weren't hospitalized.

280
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:16,433
She's just dehydrated, right?

281
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:18,903
Unfortunately, uh, Chelsea's heat stroke

282
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:20,638
has caused her to develop a condition

283
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,239
that's compromised her liver.

284
00:11:22,341 --> 00:11:23,374
Compromised?

285
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:25,242
Her liver is shutting down.

286
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:26,810
We are treating the symptoms
aggressively,

287
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:29,346
but so far, the liver is not responding.

288
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:30,681
What does that mean?

289
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:34,185
Worst case, it means
she'll need a liver transplant.

290
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:37,254
I-I can be her donor, right?

291
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:40,124
No, stupid. You need your liver.

292
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:42,826
Actually, we'd only take
a portion of hers for you.

293
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:45,396
See, dummy? I told you
I can give you a piece of mine.

294
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:46,830
And it'll be exact same match.

295
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:48,566
We're like the same person twice.

296
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:50,000
We're the same everything.

297
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:52,269
Just test me, please.

298
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:55,306
W-W-We're not quite there yet,
but, um, yes, okay.

299
00:11:55,408 --> 00:11:57,188
Wilson, let's get her tested, okay?

300
00:11:58,213 --> 00:11:59,410
Trade places?

301
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:01,612
You wish.

302
00:12:04,884 --> 00:12:07,952
When we were kids and we got in trouble,

303
00:12:08,054 --> 00:12:09,320
we had this joke that

304
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:10,854
you could call a "trade places,"

305
00:12:10,957 --> 00:12:13,157
and the other one
would go get yelled at.

306
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:14,925
And you had to do it.

307
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,594
Yeah.

308
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:20,464
Chelsea? W-What's happening to her?

309
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:22,800
Wilson, she's seizing.
Get her on her side.

310
00:12:22,902 --> 00:12:24,068
I'm right here, Chelsea. I'm right here.

311
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,603
- Okay, right now. Chelsea.
- No, she needs me.

312
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:27,271
Chandler, you need
to step away right now.

313
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:28,806
I'm right here, Chelsea! You
don't want to see this.

314
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:29,773
Get her out of here.

315
00:12:29,842 --> 00:12:31,642
Chelsea. Chelsea.

316
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:33,644
And let's push lorazepam.

317
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,547
So, what do you think?

318
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:38,115
She's fine. She's crying.

319
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,717
Take her to daycare.
Make her their problem.

320
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:41,318
Avery told me to take her
when she was asleep,

321
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,988
and she won't go to sleep,
and she won't take her bottle,

322
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,422
and she has a clean diaper.

323
00:12:45,524 --> 00:12:47,424
Maybe it's the heat.
It's pissing me off.

324
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:48,492
So I should take her someplace cool?

325
00:12:48,594 --> 00:12:49,760
No, you should take her to daycare.

326
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:51,295
Here, let me see.

327
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,834
Okay, all right. What did you do?

328
00:12:56,936 --> 00:12:59,603
Nothing. Maybe it's you.

329
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:01,338
What do you mean maybe it's me?

330
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,573
I don't know. Babies can tell

331
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:03,707
when you're tense or freaked out.

332
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:05,329
It freaks them out.

333
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:10,147
Maybe you're not a baby guy.

334
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,316
Babies just don't like some guys.

335
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:17,488
It's okay. The bad man's gone.

336
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:21,358
I'm a baby guy. You can see that, right?

337
00:13:22,795 --> 00:13:24,128
You like me.

338
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,130
You like me.

339
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:27,665
Andrew Billings, 59.

340
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:30,134
Admitted for resection
of cardiac myxoma.

341
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:32,503
6.2 centimeters in the left atrium.

342
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:35,105
Otherwise healthy
with an ASA score of 1.

343
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:36,640
She's gonna help dig out my ticker?

344
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,610
- You any good?
- The best.

345
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:41,111
Reputedly.

346
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:42,603
She'll do.

347
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,982
Let's skip to the possible
complications.

348
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:46,684
- Okay.
- Again?

349
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:48,371
Legally, we have to.

350
00:13:49,422 --> 00:13:52,222
Excessive bleeding,
coronary artery spasm,

351
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:54,792
myocardial infarction, valve regurg,

352
00:13:54,894 --> 00:13:57,061
extreme risk of stroke
due to tumor debris

353
00:13:57,163 --> 00:13:58,128
or emboli to the brain.

354
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,464
We get it. It's a dumb idea.

355
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:02,433
But what else were you gonna do today?

356
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:04,068
Andy was a shuttle commander.

357
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,503
He's been shot into space
on a big missile, so...

358
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:09,506
Wasn't so tough.
No traffic that morning.

359
00:14:09,608 --> 00:14:10,874
So you're okay with risk.

360
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,409
Yeah.

361
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:14,812
Besides, she tells me,
without the surgery,

362
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:16,756
I'll be dead inside a month.

363
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,916
That is true.

364
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:21,859
So, let's buckle in, right?

365
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:23,940
Let's do this.

366
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,457
Thanks.

367
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:32,396
She's stable.

368
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:34,398
I just got off the phone with UNOS.

369
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,667
They did give her 1-A status,
which means

370
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:38,268
she's at the top of the list.

371
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:39,269
What about me?

372
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:41,538
I thought you were testing for my...

373
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,940
Yes, your results did come back.

374
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:44,341
So fast?

375
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,909
That... That mean good...
it's good news?

376
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:48,946
Chandler, you cannot be a donor
for your sister.

377
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:50,406
I can't?

378
00:14:51,117 --> 00:14:52,916
Because you're pregnant.

379
00:14:54,754 --> 00:14:56,092
Wha...

380
00:14:56,555 --> 00:14:58,255
Wha... are... are you serious?

381
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,023
- Yes.
- Uh.

382
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:02,593
Sorry if that's not what
you wanted to hear.

383
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,828
No, no, it's... it's good news.

384
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,003
It's the best news
that you could've given me.

385
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:13,170
My husband and I, uh... it's good.

386
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:15,406
Just means I won't be able
to save my sister.

387
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:35,187
- Hey.
- Oh, can't talk.

388
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:38,290
My patient's seized.
She's in acute liver failure.

389
00:15:38,358 --> 00:15:39,424
Why do you smell like Christmas?

390
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:42,194
These are homemade cookies
courtesy of Granny June.

391
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:43,495
- Granny June?
- Mmm.

392
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:44,529
Yeah, she's the chief's patient.

393
00:15:44,598 --> 00:15:46,465
She's getting a new liver today.

394
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:48,066
You're calling her "Granny June"?

395
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:49,234
No, she asked me to.

396
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:50,735
It just feels right, you know?

397
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:52,270
She's like a human sunflower.

398
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:55,507
Wait, you get to scrub in
on a liver-transplant surgery

399
00:15:55,576 --> 00:15:57,275
for a sweet old cookie-baking grandma?

400
00:15:57,377 --> 00:15:58,176
With the chief.

401
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:00,292
- Oh, God, I hate today.
- Mm-hmm.

402
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:06,084
Have a cookie.

403
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:07,919
Shut up.

404
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:10,388
You're pregnant?

405
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:13,787
Congratulations!

406
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,094
Oh, Owen must be so excited!

407
00:16:16,196 --> 00:16:17,996
I'm sure he will be.

408
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:19,698
Wait. You haven't told him yet?

409
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:20,765
Uh, how did you tell Jackson?

410
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,934
Okay, stop. Whoa!
Stop talking right now.

411
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:24,436
What if I run into him today?

412
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:25,570
I-I'll be trying not to say it,

413
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:27,105
which means I could say it
before you say it.

414
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:28,874
I just want it to be perfect.

415
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:30,609
Okay, uh... just pretend

416
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:32,644
that you didn't tell me
and tell him, okay?

417
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:34,980
Just make sure that Owen
is the first to know.

418
00:16:35,082 --> 00:16:36,261
You can avoid a lot

419
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,216
of aggravating family court that way.

420
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:39,484
True story.

421
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:45,357
I got your page. What...
What are you doing in here?

422
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:46,725
Well, it's cool, dark, and quiet.

423
00:16:46,827 --> 00:16:48,293
How long is Avery gonna be in surgery?

424
00:16:48,362 --> 00:16:49,594
No idea. I'm with Foster today.

425
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:51,663
- What's the matter?
- I'm fine. I'm just a little...

426
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:53,064
I was talking to the baby.

427
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,033
Oh. Hey, did Tuck cry like this?

428
00:16:55,102 --> 00:16:56,568
Was there a way
that you'd carry him, or...

429
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:58,570
Well, Tuck was 4 when I met him, so, no.

430
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,005
He just had some chicken nuggets.

431
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:01,439
I didn't carry him much 'cause
it didn't seem appropriate.

432
00:17:01,508 --> 00:17:04,342
- Oh. That's a good call.
- Yeah, I thought so.

433
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:05,443
Maybe it's just colic.

434
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:06,678
What is colic, anyway.

435
00:17:06,747 --> 00:17:08,613
Well...

436
00:17:08,715 --> 00:17:10,382
- I don't really know.
- Yeah.

437
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,516
Um. You... You want me to just
hold him for a little bit?

438
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:13,051
No, no, I got it.

439
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:14,619
- Want me to get Kepner?
- No, no!

440
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:16,221
I can stop a baby from crying, Warren.

441
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,489
Of course you can.

442
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:19,624
But, you know, if Kepner's free,
then it might be...

443
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:21,526
Yeah.

444
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:23,295
Shh.

445
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:26,698
We are hitting Chelsea with antibiotics,

446
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:28,567
lactulose, diuretics,

447
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:30,569
but look at these numbers.

448
00:17:30,637 --> 00:17:31,817
We're buying time.

449
00:17:32,606 --> 00:17:33,905
She needs a liver transplant

450
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:36,541
or she'll be dead, maybe tomorrow.

451
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,945
I mean, we need a viable liver
in this hospital right now.

452
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:43,280
What?

453
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:45,250
We might already have one.

454
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,986
Oh, hell no!

455
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:50,989
Our... Our patient is in acute failure.

456
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:52,691
The liver coming to June
is a perfect match.

457
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:54,092
I checked.

458
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:56,061
The... The liver's
already been allocated.

459
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:58,296
It's June's liver.
Surgery's been scheduled.

460
00:17:58,365 --> 00:18:00,665
UNOS will allow her to give up
her place in line

461
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:03,301
and it will go to Chelsea,
but June has to agree to it.

462
00:18:03,403 --> 00:18:05,070
The request has to come from her.

463
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:06,972
Well, I haven't heard her
make any requests. Have you?

464
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,440
No, June can get the next match.

465
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:10,609
Damn it! Damn it.

466
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:13,545
Damn it. Grey, she's been
on the list three years.

467
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:16,281
Which means she's very strong
and she can wait.

468
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,216
Our patient will die in hours.

469
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:19,351
She needs this.

470
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:21,019
I know she does.

471
00:18:21,054 --> 00:18:23,054
And so does Granny June.

472
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:27,492
And since this little old lady
is the closest thing

473
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:29,928
to Mother Theresa I've ever met,

474
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,131
I know, if I ask, she's gonna say yes.

475
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:35,367
- Damn it!
- We have to ask.

476
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:40,372
I swear, you try to have
one damn day of joy around here.

477
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:45,043
So, she needs a liver, too? My liver?

478
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:47,879
This girl is in immediate need.

479
00:18:47,948 --> 00:18:51,049
If she doesn't get a liver...
it's very dire.

480
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:53,418
You said "girl." How old is she?

481
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:55,587
Well, privacy rules won't allow us...

482
00:18:55,689 --> 00:18:56,921
She's 25.

483
00:18:57,024 --> 00:18:58,857
Oh, good lord.

484
00:19:00,093 --> 00:19:02,127
How long do you think she has?

485
00:19:02,195 --> 00:19:04,829
Well, without a transplant,
her doctors don't think...

486
00:19:04,931 --> 00:19:06,531
She might not make it through the night.

487
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,833
The poor lamb.

488
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:10,568
Wait, so she's gonna get Mom's liver?

489
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:12,804
- That's not fair.
- No, Samantha, shush.

490
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:14,393
Let her finish.

491
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:21,346
If you do choose to go this way,

492
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:23,048
you would go back on the list,

493
00:19:23,116 --> 00:19:26,985
and hopefully the next liver
would be yours.

494
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:29,554
Believe me, if this wasn't
an urgent situation...

495
00:19:29,623 --> 00:19:31,656
Of... Of course. We totally understand.

496
00:19:33,493 --> 00:19:34,859
It's your decision.

497
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:36,828
Yeah. It's my decision. Mm-hmm.

498
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,330
Yeah.

499
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:46,871
But screw her.

500
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,544
You know how long I've been
waiting in this line,

501
00:19:52,646 --> 00:19:55,914
and if somebody's gonna try
and take cuts,

502
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:57,382
well, no.

503
00:19:57,451 --> 00:20:00,356
Now, she can go find her own damn liver.

504
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:02,354
No cuts.

505
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:05,223
So... your answer is no?

506
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:06,996
My answer is hell no.

507
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:09,861
Right?

508
00:20:09,963 --> 00:20:11,629
Granny's gonna get a liver today.

509
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:19,371
Whoo!

510
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:27,579
That was... Really unexpected.

511
00:20:27,702 --> 00:20:28,835
Didn't see that coming.

512
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,570
You didn't. I've been treating
her for five years.

513
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:32,305
I didn't think
she could say the word "screw."

514
00:20:32,374 --> 00:20:33,706
Such a good baker.

515
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:34,874
She's an organ hog.

516
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,409
I'm so sorry.

517
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:38,911
She could just be cranky from
not eating before the surgery.

518
00:20:39,014 --> 00:20:40,346
Don't apologize.

519
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:42,348
It is absolutely her right to say no.

520
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:44,217
It's just so unlike Mama.

521
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,885
She volunteered for Meals on Wheels.

522
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:46,890
She...

523
00:20:48,056 --> 00:20:49,652
I'm just surprised.

524
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,492
And that poor girl,
does she get another chance?

525
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,360
There's no guarantee.

526
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:57,830
Look, Lily, that is why
we have a UNOS list,

527
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:01,367
so that people can wait
their turn and get a chance,

528
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,602
fair and square,

529
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:04,303
and that's what Granny June has done.

530
00:21:04,406 --> 00:21:06,639
Well, I wish you luck
with the other girl.

531
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,364
I'll be praying for her.

532
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:11,544
Granny's getting a liver.

533
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,012
Oh, it's not funny.

534
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:14,447
I have to go call UNOS.

535
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:15,548
Ah.

536
00:21:17,018 --> 00:21:18,951
Oh, find the joy, DeLuca.

537
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:22,316
Yes, I'll hold.

538
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,257
Nothing?

539
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,626
No. I'm checking incoming traumas.

540
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:27,894
You know, I still can't believe

541
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:30,296
Bailey's patient actually said no.

542
00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:31,631
Selfish old biddy.

543
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,466
I mean, I'm sorry,
but if living that long

544
00:21:33,535 --> 00:21:36,169
doesn't teach you a little
compassion and generosity,

545
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:37,336
then what have you learned?

546
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:38,438
Don't say that to Bailey,

547
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,806
because she's full-on Team Biddy.

548
00:21:39,874 --> 00:21:41,908
Maybe I'll change her mind.

549
00:21:43,978 --> 00:21:45,945
That's admin.

550
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,080
And then enter, enter, enter.

551
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:48,114
Okay.

552
00:21:48,216 --> 00:21:49,749
Bailey.

553
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:51,951
- Chelsea's in her 20s.
- And?

554
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:54,620
And June is almost 8... almost 80.

555
00:21:54,723 --> 00:21:55,956
And?

556
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,228
Whatever offensive ageist thing
you are implying,

557
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:03,362
I'm gonna need you to say it.

558
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:05,665
Look, Chelsea has her whole life
ahead of her.

559
00:22:05,734 --> 00:22:08,234
And June has had a lifetime
of enriching experience.

560
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:09,936
And she can get another damn liver.

561
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:13,106
I cannot believe that you
of all people are saying this.

562
00:22:13,174 --> 00:22:14,907
Now, what does that mean...
me of all people?

563
00:22:14,976 --> 00:22:18,044
I mean, how can you be so ageist
when you are...

564
00:22:18,146 --> 00:22:19,479
Yes?

565
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,681
...so... wise?

566
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,715
Hey, who's ageist?

567
00:22:22,784 --> 00:22:23,783
Dr. Weber believes that

568
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:26,018
old people matter
less than young people.

569
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:28,121
That's terrible.
I have a lot of old friends.

570
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:29,155
Y-You're my old friend.

571
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:30,890
Robbins.

572
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,558
Older friend. Older than me.

573
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:34,193
Why am I not just a friend?

574
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,661
See, that's what ageism is.

575
00:22:35,764 --> 00:22:38,131
Ugh! I'm gonna go check on June.

576
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:41,434
You know, listen,
you don't look a day over 45.

577
00:22:41,536 --> 00:22:43,870
You look amazing.

578
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:44,904
You can go.

579
00:22:48,977 --> 00:22:50,943
I'm just saying, Edwards
has been like my right hand,

580
00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:53,913
and my right hand is no good
to me if it is in your pocket.

581
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:56,516
Amelia, I am not stealing Edwards.

582
00:22:56,618 --> 00:22:58,751
I am borrowing her.

583
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,520
We do this all the time,

584
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,955
like when I got that sweater
and I needed your cute shoes.

585
00:23:03,024 --> 00:23:05,057
Oh, I'm shoes now.

586
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:06,225
What happened to best resident?

587
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:07,226
You know, go check and see

588
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:08,861
if Andy's nitrous oxide study is done.

589
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,245
Thank you.

590
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:15,802
See? You should not be ordering
her around like that.

591
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,703
I should be ordering
her around like that.

592
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,272
You two need to learn to share.

593
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,908
I have a 25-year-old with liver failure

594
00:23:21,976 --> 00:23:25,511
who will die because old ladies
don't know how to share.

595
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,244
Your thing is not a problem.

596
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:29,282
I need her back.

597
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,657
I might really need her back
if I'm... you know.

598
00:23:33,488 --> 00:23:35,608
Have you peed on the stick yet?

599
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:38,191
Because if you haven't peed
on that stick yet,

600
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,192
stop talking!

601
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,760
Come on, Mer. She's excited.

602
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:41,894
I just... I don't know

603
00:23:41,996 --> 00:23:44,230
if I should tell Owen before or after.

604
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,598
H-How did you tell Derek?

605
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:49,435
I gave Zola a shirt
that said "Best Big Sister."

606
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,103
That's sweet, but not helpful.

607
00:23:51,172 --> 00:23:53,940
And then with Ellis, I was off
the hook because he was dead.

608
00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:00,546
Well, this was fun for a minute.

609
00:24:04,118 --> 00:24:05,918
This is it, Andy,

610
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,386
if you're ready.

611
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:09,822
Last chance to scrub out
of this mission.

612
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:10,923
Nah.

613
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,992
I'll see you on the other side, then.

614
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:14,758
Yep. See you then.

615
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:21,767
Okay, Andy, we're getting ready
to start the induction.

616
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,002
You're gonna feel a little drowsy,

617
00:24:23,071 --> 00:24:24,303
and then we can...

618
00:24:24,405 --> 00:24:26,005
You know any jokes?

619
00:24:26,107 --> 00:24:27,292
I'm sorry?

620
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,909
This could go one of two ways.

621
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:32,142
Thought it might be good
to go out laughing.

622
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,847
You got a good joke?

623
00:24:34,949 --> 00:24:36,282
Yeah, yes.

624
00:24:36,384 --> 00:24:37,711
Uh...

625
00:24:40,488 --> 00:24:41,454
Uh.

626
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:45,558
Um...

627
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,428
Shoot.

628
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,599
Hey, wait, wait. I got one.

629
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,269
No, that's... that's okay.

630
00:24:56,337 --> 00:24:58,927
Andy. Andy?

631
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:10,650
Hey. Are you gonna take her down?

632
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:13,319
Shh. Shh. I just got her down.

633
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:16,122
Was she crying the whole time?

634
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:17,590
Just shh, shh.

635
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:19,325
All right, you know what?
I could... Just go.

636
00:25:19,427 --> 00:25:20,726
Just go.

637
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:41,681
The liver's on its way here.

638
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,549
What are we doing out here?

639
00:25:43,651 --> 00:25:44,917
I need some air.

640
00:25:44,986 --> 00:25:47,219
This isn't air. This is steam.

641
00:25:47,322 --> 00:25:49,021
I could steal the liver.

642
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,554
I could just, like, run up and grab it.

643
00:25:52,627 --> 00:25:55,227
Or I could... walk up to the guy

644
00:25:55,296 --> 00:25:57,229
and say, "Hello, I'm Dr. Bailey.

645
00:25:57,332 --> 00:25:59,065
- Right this way."
- Do that.

646
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:00,199
Then you'll lose your job, too,

647
00:26:00,301 --> 00:26:01,567
and we'll have more time
for movies and stuff.

648
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,011
I mean, what's another week
or two to June?

649
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:08,441
She'll get another one.
People die every day.

650
00:26:10,411 --> 00:26:12,411
Maybe I should go talk to her again.

651
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:14,113
She probably didn't even hear Bailey

652
00:26:14,215 --> 00:26:15,815
or understand a thing she said.

653
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:18,284
She said no. You go back,
that's coercion.

654
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:19,552
Oh, it's not coercion.

655
00:26:19,654 --> 00:26:20,786
I'm just gonna reason with her.

656
00:26:20,855 --> 00:26:23,489
You'll get the hospital sued.
You'll get sued.

657
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:25,024
Damn it.

658
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:31,364
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- No!

659
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:34,834
Remember when you talked
to DeLuca for me?

660
00:26:34,902 --> 00:26:36,736
You only made it worse.

661
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,704
You're gonna throw DeLuca
in my face now?

662
00:26:40,008 --> 00:26:41,841
I'm not going to threaten her.

663
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:44,343
I'm just gonna maybe show her
a picture of the girl,

664
00:26:44,445 --> 00:26:46,078
shame her a little.

665
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,279
Beg.

666
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:04,697
Are you okay?

667
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,941
Yeah.

668
00:27:07,268 --> 00:27:08,693
Did you find out?

669
00:27:10,138 --> 00:27:12,838
No. Not yet.

670
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,074
Please tell me you at least told Owen.

671
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,976
I'm just not sure how.

672
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:19,979
Just tell him.
I mean, he'll be excited, right?

673
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,917
Yeah. I guess.

674
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:31,290
I didn't have to do this last time.

675
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:33,025
What do you mean last time?

676
00:27:33,127 --> 00:27:36,133
The last time I was pregnant,

677
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:39,265
I didn't have to tell the father

678
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,966
'cause he was dead.

679
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:56,890
Did you call UNOS?

680
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:58,930
Yeah.

681
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:03,244
You should go home and get some rest.

682
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:05,534
You gonna stay?

683
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:08,861
Yeah. Gonna wait out
the clock on this one.

684
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:13,388
I'll let you know
if I have any good news.

685
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:36,292
You and Shepherd
don't wait around, do you?

686
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,117
You always said that you wanted
a pile of kids.

687
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:43,585
So did you.

688
00:28:43,654 --> 00:28:46,421
I remember up at the lake,
when you and...

689
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,135
Yeah, Megan and I talked about it.

690
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:55,764
She liked the name Bernard, so...

691
00:28:57,134 --> 00:29:00,102
That slowed the conversation a bit.

692
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:03,218
And the universe had other plans.

693
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,140
Yeah.

694
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:10,913
- Owen.
- Mm-hmm.

695
00:29:12,082 --> 00:29:13,048
Something's happened.

696
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:16,418
Something terrible.

697
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:18,720
Yeah. Yeah, it did.

698
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:20,055
Grab that diaper bag, will you?

699
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,957
Yeah, stat.

700
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:26,461
Ohh. That's bad.

701
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,297
Wipes.

702
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,133
Whoa, that's a crime against humanity.

703
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,741
Damn it, more wipes.

704
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,704
More, more. Thank you.

705
00:29:35,806 --> 00:29:37,739
Good.

706
00:29:37,808 --> 00:29:39,441
So, what about you and Shepherd?

707
00:29:39,543 --> 00:29:42,277
You guys, uh, talk about it yet?

708
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:46,181
- Diaper cream.
- Diaper cream.

709
00:29:46,283 --> 00:29:48,150
Um, yeah.

710
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:50,352
Yeah, we're trying, actually.

711
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,388
Oh, that's amazing, man. Outstanding.

712
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:54,856
Diaper.

713
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:57,259
Okay.

714
00:29:58,829 --> 00:29:59,795
You know what? Give me another diaper.

715
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:00,996
We're gonna double up on this.

716
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,367
Smart.

717
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,399
Hey, you're good at this.

718
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:06,767
Well, I just have a knack, I guess.

719
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,363
Babies like me.

720
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:11,039
Yeah. Yeah, you do.

721
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:15,744
We'll know we were successful

722
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:19,081
when we see the vasculature
looks normal.

723
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:23,018
It's like fireworks.

724
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,837
Congrats, Andy.

725
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:28,991
Thank you for this.

726
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:31,293
It's like a one-in-a-million shot,

727
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,929
and it was incredible to be a part of.

728
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:35,316
My pleasure.

729
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,886
You know, you have
a real knack for cardio.

730
00:30:38,335 --> 00:30:40,269
Thank you, and that's very flattering,

731
00:30:40,337 --> 00:30:42,371
but I love neuro.

732
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:44,473
Don't worry.
I'll return you when I'm done.

733
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:47,309
You're like a neighbor's
snow plow, you know.

734
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:48,810
There's no need to buy one for yourself,

735
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:50,944
but come in handy sometimes.

736
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:53,548
Can we go back to when I was shoes?

737
00:30:57,161 --> 00:30:58,994
V-tach.

738
00:30:59,177 --> 00:31:00,442
Push 75 of lido.

739
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:02,880
I don't understand. He was stable.

740
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,126
Damn it, Andy.

741
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:06,591
Crash cart.

742
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:09,031
V-fib.

743
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,867
Paddles now.

744
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:12,968
Charge to 200.

745
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,269
Clear.

746
00:31:16,907 --> 00:31:18,073
3-0.

747
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:23,168
I usually love a good transplant.

748
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:26,240
Taking something no longer needed,

749
00:31:26,984 --> 00:31:29,685
reusing it... It's like composting.

750
00:31:29,753 --> 00:31:31,086
You, uh, compost?

751
00:31:31,188 --> 00:31:32,421
No, it's gross.

752
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:35,624
But it's good and virtuous,
and people do it.

753
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:38,627
Dr. Grey has turned a compost pile

754
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,488
and turned it into
a regular old pile of poop.

755
00:31:41,675 --> 00:31:42,589
Suction.

756
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:51,440
She stole the joy from me, from June.

757
00:31:51,508 --> 00:31:52,641
I was even trying to make a little joy

758
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:53,942
for you today, DeLuca.

759
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:55,877
Well, if it's any consolation,

760
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:58,906
this is the best day
I've had in a while, so...

761
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:00,656
No.

762
00:32:02,126 --> 00:32:03,492
I'm sorry?

763
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:06,223
No, it's no consolation. Scissors.

764
00:32:12,396 --> 00:32:13,951
He must've thrown a clot.

765
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:16,685
Apnea test shows no spontaneous
respiratory drive,

766
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,277
no brain stem reflexes.

767
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,590
He's brain dead.

768
00:32:21,905 --> 00:32:23,972
We'll do an EEG to confirm, but...

769
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:26,069
I thought we got him back in time.

770
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:28,643
I'm sorry.

771
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,316
A stick.

772
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:36,918
What?

773
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,957
What do you call a boomerang
that doesn't come back to you?

774
00:32:42,025 --> 00:32:44,226
A stick 'cause a boomerang's
supposed to return.

775
00:32:44,328 --> 00:32:46,294
- I get it.
- No.

776
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,396
Why are you telling me?

777
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:49,231
'Cause he wanted a joke.

778
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:54,002
He just wanted one joke,
and I went blank.

779
00:32:54,071 --> 00:32:58,020
I could've thought
of something, anything.

780
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:00,749
He just wanted to laugh.

781
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,179
Well, the good news is,
that was a terrible joke.

782
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,380
I know.

783
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:08,049
If the clot hadn't killed him,
that joke would have,

784
00:33:08,118 --> 00:33:09,618
so it's a really good thing
he didn't hear it.

785
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:10,852
That's not funny. How can you...

786
00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:12,821
Edwards.

787
00:33:12,923 --> 00:33:15,293
No, you have to find the good.

788
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,592
Andy did.

789
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,845
He knew this was a long shot.

790
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:23,765
He knew he might die,

791
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:25,700
and he could've died at home
from acute heart failure

792
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,285
instead of here in post-op.

793
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:30,245
But then he wouldn't have
been able to donate his organs,

794
00:33:30,674 --> 00:33:32,212
and that was important to him.

795
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,310
And that's good. He...

796
00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:40,248
Come with me.

797
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:44,820
Are you sure?

798
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,655
I don't want to get excited
if this isn't real,

799
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:49,224
and I don't want to tell them
if this isn't real.

800
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:50,792
He's ABO compatible.

801
00:33:50,894 --> 00:33:52,828
And UNOS has been notified.

802
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,629
He's 180 pounds.

803
00:33:54,731 --> 00:33:57,065
He's a non-drinker. He's a non-smoker.

804
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,039
- His liver is...
- It's perfect.

805
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,614
It's real, Mer. We have a liver for her.

806
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:07,142
Oh, Dr. Bailey was right.

807
00:34:07,244 --> 00:34:09,678
This is a glorious day.

808
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:24,747
And the liver pinked up
almost immediately,

809
00:34:24,821 --> 00:34:26,220
which is a good sign.

810
00:34:26,322 --> 00:34:27,888
Oh.

811
00:34:27,957 --> 00:34:30,925
Of course, we still have
to watch for signs of rejection

812
00:34:30,994 --> 00:34:34,195
in these first 24 hours,
but so far, so good.

813
00:34:34,263 --> 00:34:35,196
Let's hear it, you guys!

814
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,166
Oh. Shh.

815
00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:40,668
We can't thank you enough.

816
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,635
Oh.

817
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,838
Oh, Karen, give him the scarf.

818
00:34:46,943 --> 00:34:47,808
Ah.

819
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,577
Uh.

820
00:34:52,615 --> 00:34:54,482
- Mama made me finish it, so...
- Thank you.

821
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:55,816
Oh, group pic!

822
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:56,851
- Hmm? Group pic.
- Oh. Oh.

823
00:34:56,953 --> 00:34:58,486
- Come on.
- Oh.

824
00:34:58,588 --> 00:35:00,888
This is for the Christmas card.

825
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:02,390
All right.

826
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:03,791
All right, "liver" on three.

827
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,192
One, two, three.

828
00:35:05,261 --> 00:35:06,093
Liver!

829
00:35:13,302 --> 00:35:16,070
Okay, let's get ready
for the vascular anastomoses.

830
00:35:16,172 --> 00:35:18,522
I've got the vena cava.

831
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:21,809
So, how is the old biddy?

832
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,277
She's fine.

833
00:35:23,379 --> 00:35:24,979
Hoarder.

834
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:31,685
No, I get it.

835
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,721
If it were you,
if you were in June's position,

836
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:34,889
I'd want you to have it.

837
00:35:34,957 --> 00:35:38,726
And if someone asked,
I'd say screw them, too.

838
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,897
Just how old do you think I am?

839
00:35:48,171 --> 00:35:49,837
We not going home?

840
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:52,039
No. I want to see this.

841
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:56,043
I want to get as much
of my joy on as I can.

842
00:35:58,581 --> 00:36:00,648
This is the worst day.

843
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:02,083
This is the best day.

844
00:36:02,151 --> 00:36:04,218
I should be in that surgery.

845
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,087
My patient can't catch a break all day,

846
00:36:06,155 --> 00:36:07,922
and the second that
something good happens,

847
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,958
I get bumped again
because Pierce told Grey

848
00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:12,793
that Stephanie's had a really tough day.

849
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:13,894
She really needs it.

850
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,096
That happened to me today, too.

851
00:36:15,198 --> 00:36:16,297
Pathetic.

852
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:17,698
I'll take it where I can get it.

853
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,403
You should really get that treated.

854
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,406
- What?
- Your self-pity gland.

855
00:36:25,508 --> 00:36:26,574
It's incredibly swollen.

856
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,043
Go to hell.

857
00:36:29,078 --> 00:36:31,545
I'm a doctor. I can see it from here.

858
00:36:31,614 --> 00:36:33,447
Well, I'm gonna treat it with alcohol.

859
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:35,316
That's the recommended course.
I support that.

860
00:36:35,384 --> 00:36:36,984
And push two more of these.

861
00:36:37,086 --> 00:36:39,086
Oh. Thank you.

862
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:45,593
So, she ate about an hour ago.

863
00:36:45,695 --> 00:36:47,895
You had her all day? I thought you
were gonna take her to daycare.

864
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,463
Yeah, I wasn't that busy.

865
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,133
Oh, he didn't want
to put her down is what it was.

866
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,001
Happened to me all the time.

867
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,803
It's the way her head smells.

868
00:36:55,905 --> 00:36:56,971
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

869
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,975
I'm just glad she didn't
give you any trouble.

870
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,843
I was fine. She was great.

871
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:03,878
- Okay.
- Easy.

872
00:37:03,913 --> 00:37:05,079
All right, thanks again.

873
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,245
Mm-hmm.

874
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:10,050
You and Shepherd ought to get on
getting one of those.

875
00:37:22,498 --> 00:37:26,133
Yeah, so she's getting
the transplant, uh, tonight.

876
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:31,041
So, I'm... I'm just gonna...
I want to stay tonight, yeah.

877
00:37:31,741 --> 00:37:34,153
I-I don't know when I'm gonna be home.

878
00:37:35,344 --> 00:37:36,866
Yeah, me too.

879
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,162
Oh, Rick, I'm pregnant.

880
00:37:42,685 --> 00:37:44,552
No, I-I wanted to tell you
when I saw you,

881
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,055
but then I... I didn't want to wait.

882
00:37:48,157 --> 00:37:49,825
I-I couldn't wait.

883
00:37:50,326 --> 00:37:52,026
I couldn't know without you knowing.

884
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,428
Every cloud has a silver lining.

885
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:56,397
Yeah.

886
00:37:56,499 --> 00:37:57,865
Uh-huh, yeah.

887
00:38:00,503 --> 00:38:01,936
I love you, too.

888
00:38:03,506 --> 00:38:04,538
But it's still a cloud.

889
00:38:20,489 --> 00:38:22,114
What is this?

890
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,859
Well, I was gonna wrap it
like a present,

891
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,762
but then I thought
I would hand it to you,

892
00:38:28,831 --> 00:38:30,798
and you'd hand it to me,
and then I'd pee on it,

893
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,334
so that felt weird.

894
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,803
Um, but then I just thought
I would take the test

895
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:37,037
and hand it to you on a plate,

896
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:39,073
but then we couldn't use
the plates anymore, so I...

897
00:38:39,175 --> 00:38:41,144
Amelia, are you...

898
00:38:42,144 --> 00:38:44,111
Are you pregnant?

899
00:38:44,213 --> 00:38:46,046
I might be.

900
00:38:49,552 --> 00:38:51,252
I think I might be.

901
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,589
A cloud can mean a shower or a storm.

902
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,392
I was gonna wait until I knew
for sure, but, I don't know,

903
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,662
I just wanted you to know, too,
so do you want to find out?

904
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:07,301
So, you take your good days
where you can get them.

905
00:39:08,337 --> 00:39:09,470
We have to close it.

906
00:39:09,538 --> 00:39:10,771
Ah, one more minute.

907
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,208
One more minute of cool air
or a week of spoiled food.

908
00:39:14,277 --> 00:39:15,476
You guys, she's pregnant.

909
00:39:15,544 --> 00:39:16,677
We don't know that.

910
00:39:16,746 --> 00:39:17,645
Who's pregnant?

911
00:39:17,713 --> 00:39:19,213
It's my first sister's pregnancy.

912
00:39:19,282 --> 00:39:20,514
I missed all of yours.

913
00:39:20,616 --> 00:39:21,582
Amelia's pregnant?

914
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,384
- Maybe.
- I hope so.

915
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,551
Yeah.

916
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,905
Me too.

917
00:39:26,422 --> 00:39:28,322
She'll be talking for two now.

918
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,129
Try to stay positive.

919
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,997
Hey, did I tell you I spent
all day with Harriet today?

920
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:38,532
It was so much fun.

921
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:40,334
After a while, it... it just...

922
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:42,436
it felt like I'd done it forever.

923
00:39:42,538 --> 00:39:43,537
Hey, how'd it go?

924
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,372
Good. Uh, got that part down.

925
00:39:45,441 --> 00:39:46,707
What's it say?

926
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:49,243
Uh, takes a minute.

927
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,844
Want to sit?

928
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,479
Okay. Go ahead. Let's sit.

929
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:53,947
Yeah.

930
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,182
So, I was thinking that

931
00:39:55,284 --> 00:39:58,489
we could turn the study
into the nursery.

932
00:39:58,988 --> 00:40:01,689
Or maybe we should just have
the crib in with us.

933
00:40:01,757 --> 00:40:03,891
I mean, we haven't even
talked about this.

934
00:40:03,993 --> 00:40:06,060
You see anything?

935
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:07,194
Not yet.

936
00:40:09,665 --> 00:40:10,631
You know, and then we can...

937
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,933
we can turn the nursery into his room...

938
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,568
or her room.

939
00:40:14,637 --> 00:40:16,103
I mean, it's a good room
for a kid, right?

940
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,004
We don't need a study, and...

941
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:21,241
What? What?

942
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:30,050
You try to remember that,
even in the bad news...

943
00:40:30,152 --> 00:40:31,618
Oh.

944
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:34,922
That's okay.

945
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:37,891
You know, it's...

946
00:40:39,095 --> 00:40:40,794
We just started.

947
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,996
We'll keep trying. Okay?

948
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:50,604
...there's good news for someone.

949
00:40:56,773 --> 00:41:01,640

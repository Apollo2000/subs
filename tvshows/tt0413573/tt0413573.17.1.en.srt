1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:01,688
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:03,322
Okay, Cindy Wright.

3
00:00:03,347 --> 00:00:04,444
She fits the profile.

4
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:05,615
Arrest this woman for child trafficking!

5
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,350
Please escort Dr. DeLuca to my office.

6
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:08,985
What? Me?! What,
you're just gonna let her go?

7
00:00:09,053 --> 00:00:10,687
I did the job that needed to be done!

8
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:11,868
Andrew, you sound like your father.

9
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:13,216
This is Gemma.

10
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,858
- Uh, she's a friend.
- I can see that.

11
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:16,826
Something's wrong with me.
What's happening?

12
00:00:16,894 --> 00:00:19,029
Cobalt poisoning would
explain the dementia, the depression,

13
00:00:19,063 --> 00:00:21,077
hallucinations, tremors... Everything.

14
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,599
Is your mind playing tricks on you again?

15
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:24,701
Did you stand by me
while I was being fired?

16
00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:26,443
I'm tired of telling you
that I want more.

17
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,884
I hope you find someone
who will give that to you.

18
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:29,119
Dr. Winston Ndugu.

19
00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:31,554
I have had a crush on you
since my first day of residency.

20
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:33,056
What do you think of the name Scout?

21
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,357
So cute.

22
00:00:34,392 --> 00:00:35,926
- We're getting married.
- I want a life with you.

23
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,627
Are you really sure
you want to close this door?

24
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,728
A voicemail from Dr. Altman.

25
00:00:38,763 --> 00:00:40,964
I can't leave with you.

26
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:42,065
I am marrying Owen.

27
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:44,134
I'm so sorry, honey. We'll reschedule.

28
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:45,735
Why are we rescheduling?

29
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,309
I've heard that when tidal waves hit,

30
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,611
there are often people watching on shore.

31
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,119
They see the disaster coming,
see the horizon disappearing.

32
00:01:03,154 --> 00:01:06,256
They don't really see
until it's too late.

33
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,160
There's a lecture we take in residency

34
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:12,896
that's meant to prepare us
for such surprises.

35
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,998
It's called Disaster Ethics...

36
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:18,068
Where future surgeons imagine
what they would do

37
00:01:18,102 --> 00:01:20,236
when the unimaginable happens.

38
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:28,727
But it's imperfect.

39
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:32,305
Because while it's good
to plan for the worst,

40
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,652
you can't really know
how you'll handle it

41
00:01:35,686 --> 00:01:38,188
until you're smack dab
in the middle of it,

42
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:41,358
under the wave, trying not to drown.

43
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:47,384

Thank you!

00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:12,322
I'll see you after the shift change.

48
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:13,790
You be careful out there.

49
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:16,092
You be careful in there.

50
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,294
We are doing everything right.

51
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:21,197
We are wearing masks.
We are wearing gloves.

52
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:22,832
We are slowing the spread.

53
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:26,359
I am good and my family is g...

54
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:30,173
Oh, please don't tell me
you're experiencing symptoms.

55
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:33,676
I am absolutely not
experiencing any symptoms.

56
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:35,785
I'm here to work.

57
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,580
I'm cobalt free, Miranda.

58
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,883
I've done my hip rehab.
I'm better than ever.

59
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:42,118
Just tell me where you want me,
but don't say back home.

60
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:43,520
Well, everything's changed.

61
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:46,222
I mean, specialties no longer matter.

62
00:02:46,257 --> 00:02:48,258
Surgeons check temperatures.

63
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:50,913
Attendings do scut. It's a madhouse.

64
00:02:50,947 --> 00:02:52,062
On fire.

65
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:53,296
Well, you better show me around.

66
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,364
Unless you're too busy.

67
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:56,332
You can send me off with a resident.

68
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:59,436
You know, I'd love
to say hello to DeLuca.

69
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:04,465
DeLuca is no longer a resident.

70
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:06,543
So, Andrew's in the on-call room on 3.

71
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,844
He didn't even want to come in today,

72
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:10,113
but I didn't think
he should be alone, so...

73
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:11,214
Right.

74
00:03:11,248 --> 00:03:13,550
Because you're so concerned
about his well-being.

75
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:15,051
This is unbelievable.

76
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:16,412
What happened with DeLuca now?

77
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,388
He could barely get up
after Richard's surgery.

78
00:03:18,422 --> 00:03:21,124
It's the depression that
always comes after the mania.

79
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:23,359
You knew this happens,
b-but you pushed him anyways.

80
00:03:23,384 --> 00:03:24,499
And you let her.

81
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:31,367
First stop for every employee.
A few questions.

82
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:34,971
And if your temperature's
even a hair over 100 degrees,

83
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,973
you go back home. No exceptions.

84
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:39,809
And once you're cleared...
Here, get in here...

85
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,177
You will change

86
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:43,686
and be fitted with a new N95.

87
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:46,316
Alright, let's move it.

88
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:49,819
How was the picnic?

89
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:51,588
It turned into a sleepover, actually.

90
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:54,157
On the laundry-room floor?

91
00:03:54,225 --> 00:03:55,325
Yeah, Zola didn't want me to leave,

92
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:57,927
and I-I was too tired
to go back to the hotel room.

93
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:00,296
So she had a picnic on the kitchen floor,

94
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:02,332
and I got takeout.

95
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:05,235
And we talked to each other
through the closed door,

96
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:07,537
and then I made a bed

97
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:09,339
out of some baby blankets
I found in the dryer.

98
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:11,241
You are such a good aunt.

99
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:13,343
Yeah, my back is killing me,

100
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:16,246
but it sure beats lying
in my hotel-room bed

101
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,748
and watching terrifying
statistics on the news

102
00:04:18,816 --> 00:04:20,350
and knowing that's not even
half the story.

103
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:22,485
Yeah. I tried explaining to my grandma

104
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,521
how this is impacting
Black folks more severely.

105
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,923
But all she wants to talk
about is how sacrilegious it is

106
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:28,358
to attend church on a computer.

107
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:32,028
Dr. Ndugu, we have a dissection.

108
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:33,329
Uh, I gotta go, babe. Love you.

109
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,935
- Love you?
- Hm?

110
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:40,170
Were you eavesdropping on my call?

111
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:42,161
Not on purpose.

112
00:04:43,174 --> 00:04:44,741
Sounds like things
are going pretty well, though,

113
00:04:44,775 --> 00:04:46,276
if you're at "love you" already.

114
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,644
Well, we're not. I'm not... We're...

115
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:51,047
That's just... That's just,
like, a-a thing people say.

116
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,183
- By rote.
- Is it?

117
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:54,884
How's Vic?

118
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,487
It's really nice of them
to clap us in and out every day.

119
00:04:57,555 --> 00:05:00,023
I... I really appreciate that.

120
00:05:00,057 --> 00:05:02,392
- Yeah.
- Yeah. It really is.

121
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:03,459
It's nice.

122
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:10,033
Ooh, we have a visitor.

123
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,670
Who is here coming to visit us?

124
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:18,107
Hey, hey, hey, I'm...

125
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:19,375
- Oh, hey!
- Oh!

126
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,444
- Uh, what is...
- Oh! No.

127
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:23,012
What is going on? Hi.

128
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:24,581
No, no. Um...

129
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,049
I thought...

130
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,785
We were texting and you said
to come over with nothing on.

131
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:30,720
- I didn't mean right now.
- So you... Okay.

132
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:33,179
Okay. Um, sorry. I'm sorry. Hello?

133
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:34,339
- Hi.
- Come on...

134
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:36,326
No, no, you know what? Actually. No.

135
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,027
It's fine. It's okay. It's good.

136
00:05:38,062 --> 00:05:39,963
It's not that... cold out, actually,

137
00:05:39,997 --> 00:05:41,764
- so I'm just... I'm gonna go.
- Hey. No, you don't need to leave.

138
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:43,466
No, I do. I have to, okay?

139
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,701
This is...

140
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,036
This was good.

141
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:50,206
This was a mistake. But this whole thing.

142
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:51,856
I'm not a...

143
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,067
I'm not a stepmom.

144
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:57,580
You're not a stepmom.

145
00:05:57,615 --> 00:06:01,551
I'm just... I'm a person
who shows up at penthouses

146
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:04,087
wearing puffy coats
and nothing else, so...

147
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:05,620
Yeah.

148
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:07,557
Wow. Okay.

149
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:10,927
Um, this was too much too soon.

150
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:12,895
Thank you.

151
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,265
Hi, Harriett, it was really nice...

152
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:17,800
Really nice to meet you
after all this time.

153
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,270
Um, okay, bye.

154
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:22,105
Godspeed.

155
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,837
- Next.
- This happens when I eat nuts,

156
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:25,441
but I didn't eat any nuts.

157
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:28,111
- Uh, I don't think.
- Those food labels are small.

158
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:29,312
Here.

159
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:30,713
Okay, 98.6.

160
00:06:30,748 --> 00:06:32,448
So you are going to want to follow

161
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:33,616
the purple line to the ER.

162
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:36,486
I don't want a Chinese doctor.

163
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,421
Oh, okay.

164
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:39,455
Then you're going to want to follow

165
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:40,823
this green line to the parking lot,

166
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:42,325
put your rude self back in your car

167
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:45,561
and hope you don't go into
anaphylactic shock.

168
00:06:46,597 --> 00:06:48,431
I'll follow the purple line to the ER.

169
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:50,665
Perfect.

170
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:53,436
OMG. Dr. Webber.

171
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,138
You look great. Hearts.

172
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:56,172
Perez.

173
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,340
Next.

174
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,277
Hey.

175
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:03,579
Can you please make sure
this gets up to the Covid floor

176
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:05,848
- with Enna Ravera?
- Just leave it.

177
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,017
Uh, hey, Karen, uh, could I get an update

178
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,019
for Ike Donerson?
He's a friend of a friend.

179
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,322
Happy to check on him for you, Dr. Hunt.

180
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:14,457
- Hope the kids are doing okay.
- Oh, thanks.

181
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:17,733
Um, my Mom's hands are full,
but she's managing.

182
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,563
There's another tent for visitors

183
00:07:20,597 --> 00:07:22,265
'cause none are allowed in the hospital

184
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,900
unless accompanying a young child.

185
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:26,436
- Dr. Webber?
- Ah, Hunt.

186
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,539
Altman. I-I-Is it still Altman?

187
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:32,542
- Yeah, still Altman.
- Ah.

188
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:34,911
I hate to leave,
but I-I-I got to get back.

189
00:07:34,945 --> 00:07:36,713
Yeah, and II've got another...

190
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,382
- Uh.
- Alright, the less severe symptoms

191
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,983
are sent home to self-quarantine.

192
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:42,518
The more severe are admitted.

193
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:45,655
The entire OR heard a recording

194
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:49,225
of Altman and Koracick having sex...

195
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,095
...or was that the cobalt talking?

196
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:55,732
- That was not the cobalt.
- Ooh!

197
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,500
Stop it. Stop it.

198
00:07:57,534 --> 00:07:58,568
- You're bad. Stop it.
- Stop?

199
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:00,670
I came back just so
I could ask the question.

200
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:03,206
- What is wrong...
- What?

201
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:08,478
The entire east wing is now a Covid ward.

202
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:11,848
We've converted whole floors
into negative pressure rooms.

203
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:15,218
Severe patients go to
this special Covid ICU.

204
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:17,053
So far we have enough ventilators.

205
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:19,455
Well, what about PPE for the staff?

206
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,424
We are reusing what we have,

207
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,525
but we need more... a lot... Wait.

208
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:24,560
- No, no, no, no.
- Well, someone's coding here.

209
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:27,830
Uh, and we have staff inside
to deal with it.

210
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:30,032
Look, hospitals are losing
too many of their own.

211
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:33,102
So no one goes through
those doors without full PPE,

212
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,570
which is in short supply.

213
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:36,506
Yes, it goes against everything we teach,

214
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,941
but there are no emergencies
in a pandemic.

215
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,943
Marvin Lindstrom. 83.

216
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:45,047
He was fine yesterday,
became hypoxic an hour ago.

217
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:47,550
It's the fourth patient I've lost today,

218
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:49,318
and they're all dying alone.

219
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:51,454
Welcome back, Richard.

220
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:03,773
Hey, so, bed 4 needs
to go up for CT, okay?

221
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:05,918
- Still has pain in the chest?
- Yes.

222
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,237
- Hughes, we're not taking...
- No, I know.

223
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:11,772
I know you're not taking
any non-Covid cases,

224
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:14,108
but you are taking this teenager
with full thickness burns

225
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:15,776
from head to toe from a car explosion.

226
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,910
I intubated him on the scene.

227
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:18,612
He's hypotensive and tachycardic
and you are the best

228
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,714
so you are taking him because
if you send us away, he dies,

229
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:22,249
and that makes you a murderer.

230
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:23,450
- Okay.
- Okay.

231
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:24,852
Trauma 1.

232
00:09:24,886 --> 00:09:26,687
You were right to bring him here.

233
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:33,627
Emergent surgeries only,
so it's empty most of the time.

234
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,063
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

235
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:38,958
I try not to look at it. Too sad.

236
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:43,103
Bailey, what the hell is that?

237
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:45,906
Oh, not that, her.

238
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,011
She's my new best friend.

239
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:52,813
She hates germs as much as I do.

240
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:54,515
Uh, see that UV light?

241
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:56,817
It can disinfect a room in minutes.

242
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:58,497
Hands-free.

243
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,754
That's incredible.

244
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:03,557
I used to go see babies
when I needed serotonin.

245
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,126
But they don't let visitors
on the OB floor anymore.

246
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:07,661
So now I come see her.

247
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:10,764
She's sleek, beautiful, she hates germs.

248
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,834
- I love her.
- Uh, do my eyes deceive me?

249
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:16,003
Captain Cobalt, welcome back.

250
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:18,025
- Ugh.
- What, too soon?

251
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,640
No, in all seriousness,

252
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:21,575
I'm so happy to see you
on your feet again.

253
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:23,010
What's with the nine iron?

254
00:10:23,044 --> 00:10:25,245
Oh, well, this way
you won't get any closer

255
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,779
than, uh, six feet from me.

256
00:10:26,814 --> 00:10:28,749
You don't need a golf club for that, Tom.

257
00:10:28,817 --> 00:10:30,113
Any word on the shipment?

258
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:31,752
Uh, relax, Bailey.
I said it's coming, it's coming.

259
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:34,516
What, you got N95s and face shields?

260
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:37,665
Because there's pirates
out there and hucksters.

261
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:40,668
Has Catherine been coming in?

262
00:10:40,703 --> 00:10:42,036
Sometimes.

263
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:44,772
- Uh, Richard, I've got a trauma.
- Oh, I'll come.

264
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,775
No, you go read the safety manuals

265
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:49,277
and memorize the new protocols.

266
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:52,080
Can't let anything
fall through the cracks.

267
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:53,815
Or anyone.

268
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,086
Can I help you?

269
00:10:58,153 --> 00:11:01,155
A patient of your brother's
would like to see him.

270
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,058
- No. Absolutely not.
- It's Cindy Wright.

271
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:06,127
The girl he said was being trafficked.

272
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:07,962
It appears he was right.

273
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:10,932
S-She's here? Is she okay?

274
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:14,102
She is here but I would not say
she is okay.

275
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:16,604
No, Bailey, you need to stop doing this.

276
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:18,473
I-I wouldn't be here
if it were anyone else.

277
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:20,608
But I think he's
the only person in the world

278
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:22,043
she trusts right now.

279
00:11:25,214 --> 00:11:28,116
Oh, my...

280
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:36,737
You sure about this?

281
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:38,393
No.

282
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:52,607
- Hey.
- I'm so sorry.

283
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:55,243
I'm sorry I didn't listen,
but I was scared.

284
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:59,013
You do not need to apologize
for anything, okay?

285
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:01,115
I'm just glad you came back.

286
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:05,104
Walk me through what happened.
How did you get here?

287
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:10,317
I got sicker,
and Opal said I was useless.

288
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,946
She dropped me off
on the side of the interstate.

289
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:17,165
But I remembered the name of this place.

290
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:19,133
And you.

291
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:20,802
Chief, do you mind if I go in with her?

292
00:12:20,836 --> 00:12:23,004
I'll throw on some lead. Of course.

293
00:12:32,748 --> 00:12:35,049
Isn't DeLuca...

294
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:36,884
I mean, people have been saying he...

295
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,619
Get the man a vest.

296
00:12:54,103 --> 00:12:56,113
- Hi.
- Schmitt.

297
00:12:56,872 --> 00:12:58,206
Marvin Lindstrom just died.

298
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,542
No. Please, no.

299
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:04,045
I tried calling his wife.
It rolled to voicemail.

300
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:06,080
- Are you with her?
- She's here.

301
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:08,249
Her flip phone died,
and we didn't have a charger.

302
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:10,518
She wanted to say goodbye to him.

303
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:12,487
Well, I wanted that, too, Schmitt.

304
00:13:12,554 --> 00:13:14,890
There just wasn't time.
It happened so fast.

305
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:18,092
They were married 62 years.

306
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:20,161
I held his hand while he died.

307
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:22,063
So if you can't deliver the news to her,

308
00:13:22,097 --> 00:13:24,499
just find someone who can.

309
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:29,192
What do we have?

310
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:30,938
Engine blew when he
was trying to cool it down.

311
00:13:30,973 --> 00:13:32,173
It started a fire.

312
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:34,242
He's got extensive full-thickness burns.

313
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:35,590
- Let's hang some fluids.
- On it.

314
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,253
Kids decided to break
quarantine, went out to a party.

315
00:13:38,313 --> 00:13:39,447
A party? Now?

316
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:41,749
Okay, I gotta call my kids
and threaten them.

317
00:13:41,784 --> 00:13:44,218
You want, uh, back up?
Want me to page Altman?

318
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:45,386
No, no, no, we're good.

319
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:46,621
He's hypotensive.

320
00:13:46,688 --> 00:13:48,523
Arms are all charred.

321
00:13:48,557 --> 00:13:50,391
This IV's blown. I need access.

322
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:53,261
- Okay. IO kit.
- Right away, Doctor.

323
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:55,256
Okay, here we go.

324
00:13:56,198 --> 00:13:58,099
Order a trauma panel.
Let's get x-ray in here.

325
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,300
His sats are still dropping.

326
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:00,601
He's getting harder to bag.

327
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:02,970
These chest burns are preventing
his lungs from expanding.

328
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:04,438
- Escharotomy. Scalpel.
- Escharotomy. Scalpel.

329
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:14,615
Alright, we need to get this kid to an OR

330
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:16,717
- and start debriding, ASAP.
- Yeah, I already paged for help.

331
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:19,153
I need to stay down here. There's
other kids coming in from this fire.

332
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:21,289
- Alright, copy that.
- Hey, Hunt, I got your page.

333
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:22,658
And here's your help.

334
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:31,165
Everything okay?

335
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:33,301
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Great.

336
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:38,239
Okay. Let's get ready to move.

337
00:14:50,314 --> 00:14:54,064
You hear this, uh, kid
was out partying with friends?

338
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:57,653
I don't know what the hell
these kids are thinking.

339
00:14:57,721 --> 00:15:01,791
Yeah, well, people do stupid things.

340
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,664
Hey.

341
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:10,166
Hey.

342
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,503
I'm, uh, about to be done here
if you need the room.

343
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,506
No, actually, I was looking for you.

344
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:18,274
I need a favor.

345
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:19,542
Cool. Consult?

346
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:21,043
Yeah, kind of.

347
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:22,812
Um...

348
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:25,715
Actually, no, not... Not like a consult.

349
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:27,150
Um...

350
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:28,170
S...

351
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:30,153
- Sex.
- What's that?

352
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:31,142
Sex.

353
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:32,889
I need sex.

354
00:15:32,956 --> 00:15:34,824
I need a sex favor.

355
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:36,759
A sexual favor.

356
00:15:38,862 --> 00:15:40,897
I... W-What?

357
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:45,868
I need a bridge over the river
of the husband who abandoned me.

358
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:47,116
A short bridge.

359
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,497
No, like a... Like a one-night bridge.

360
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,211
I-I can't tell if you're
being serious. Are you...

361
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,414
Look, I don't know how to be
single or feel single again.

362
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:01,751
I just... I-I don't know how
to cross over the bridge

363
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:05,655
over into the land of Not a Sad Sack.

364
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:08,491
Of Not a... The land of Not a Sad Sack?

365
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:11,894
- Okay.
- Okay, I-I need to have sex, Jackson.

366
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:13,563
With someone that I trust to be safe

367
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,798
and... and just not murder me
in my sleep.

368
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,100
And I need a bridge, so I'm asking.

369
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:20,770
I am truly asking for a favor.

370
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:22,572
A sexy favor.

371
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,440
Okay, and you... And you can say no

372
00:16:24,508 --> 00:16:28,778
if you feel used
or objectified or whatever,

373
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:30,847
but I hope that you just feel flattered

374
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:34,917
because I'm mostly saying
that you're a human male

375
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,753
that I kind of trust.

376
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,984
Okay.

377
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:43,526
Like, okay okay?

378
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,728
I mean, it's not exactly a hardship, Jo.

379
00:16:45,762 --> 00:16:48,564
Oh, my God. Okay. Um... tonight?

380
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:50,466
- Sure. Yeah.
- Okay.

381
00:16:50,534 --> 00:16:52,435
- My... My place?
- Okay. Yes!

382
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:54,804
Thank you. Thank you. You're the best.

383
00:16:54,838 --> 00:16:57,106
- Thanks.
- Okay.

384
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,708
Yo!

385
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:00,392
- Okay.
- Okay, Jo.

386
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:05,214
Dora, hi, it's Dr. Grey calling.

387
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:08,718
I... I'm okay, thank you for asking.

388
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:12,822
Dora, I-I'm so sorry
to tell you, but your father...

389
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:15,258
His condition got much worse last night.

390
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:18,327
So, um, I'm afraid if...

391
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:20,997
If you do want to come
and say goodbye, then...

392
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:23,966
Then you should come soon.

393
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,674
Now.

394
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:28,237
Okay.

395
00:17:28,272 --> 00:17:31,073
Okay, uh, just call me when you're here,

396
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:33,182
and I'll make the arrangements.

397
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:36,812
Okay. I'm... I'm so... I'm so sorry.

398
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,081
Okay.

399
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:51,967
_

400
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:55,204
_

401
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:02,672
You're doing great, Cindy.

402
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,507
Almost done, okay?

403
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:08,311
I'm not Cindy.

404
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:14,750
My name is Erin Banks.

405
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:17,653
I'm from Scottsdale, Arizona.

406
00:18:20,857 --> 00:18:24,060
This photographer followed me
on Snapchat.

407
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:26,896
He said that he had a modeling agency

408
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,331
and that I was beautiful.

409
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:32,001
He wanted to meet,
but my parents said no.

410
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:34,159
My sister said it was sketchy.

411
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:38,674
But I snuck out to meet him.

412
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,746
That was two years ago.

413
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,248
Two years? So she was fourteen.

414
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:48,484
Helm...

415
00:18:48,552 --> 00:18:51,721
Take this. Call the police immediately.

416
00:18:51,788 --> 00:18:53,422
Say to them what she just said.

417
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,690
Her family needs to know

418
00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:56,726
their little girl is still alive. Go, go.

419
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,031
Lord, help us.

420
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:03,933
My parents tried to warn me,

421
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:05,901
but I'm so dumb.

422
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,003
I'm so stupid.

423
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,005
Hey, hey, stop that. Okay, listen to me.

424
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,940
None of this is your fault, okay?

425
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:12,675
None of it.

426
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:15,544
It's Opal, and people like her.

427
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:16,879
It's their fault.

428
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:19,615
And we got you.

429
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:22,551
And they're never going to
hurt you ever again, okay?

430
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,522
Opal said that if I ran, she'd kill me,

431
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:30,192
and if I told anyone, she'd find
my sister and take her, too.

432
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,303
Soak it in, kids.

433
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:44,607
Bask in the glory of the PPE mother lode.

434
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,208
It's beautiful.

435
00:19:46,243 --> 00:19:48,477
It came? It actually came!

436
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:51,380
I forgot what good news feels like.

437
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:54,275
- Altman, can I help you?
- Uh, yeah.

438
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,318
I mean, our nurses are using rubber bands

439
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:57,319
to hold on their masks.

440
00:19:57,354 --> 00:19:58,687
Can't we help you open these?

441
00:19:58,722 --> 00:20:00,389
Or were you planning to sell
them on the black market?

442
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:03,325
Oh, my God, were you?

443
00:20:03,393 --> 00:20:06,195
No, no, I just...
We... We need, uh, a system.

444
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:08,164
Yeah, okay, well,
you know, we open these,

445
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:09,965
we take the masks,
and run around the hospital

446
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,767
like Santa Claus on Christmas.
That's the system.

447
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,702
Fine, fine, but you two stand guard

448
00:20:13,737 --> 00:20:15,237
in case someone sneaks in
from another hospital.

449
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:17,807
- Are you serious?
- This stuff is paper gold, Tseng.

450
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,574
So now you're
the best-educated security guard

451
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:20,781
this side of the Mississippi.

452
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:22,778
I got booties!

453
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,113
Booties.

454
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:25,815
Booties. Good. Booties are good.

455
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,349
Yeah. Okay, but we also need masks.

456
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:29,985
Yeah, well, we also need... booties.

457
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,221
You ordered masks, right?

458
00:20:32,255 --> 00:20:33,923
And gloves and shields?

459
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,424
- Of course I did. I...
- These are all booties.

460
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:37,193
By the thousands. Booties, more booties.

461
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,294
They're here, somewhere.

462
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:40,696
They're here some...

463
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,044
Damn it!

464
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:57,480
Oh, my God! Koracick!

465
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:01,350
Tom!

466
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:22,786
He's still tachycardic.

467
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:25,556
His body's so stressed from the burns.

468
00:21:25,591 --> 00:21:27,666
God, it's so hot in here.

469
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,188
It has to be. I mean, the burns mean

470
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:30,928
his body can't regulate temperature,

471
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:32,743
so we got to crank the whole room way up.

472
00:21:32,767 --> 00:21:34,131
I know that.

473
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,801
I wasn't saying you didn't, Jo.

474
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:38,436
Okay, then why even say it?

475
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,804
You said it was hot. I said why.

476
00:21:39,838 --> 00:21:41,939
Okay? I thought
we were just stating facts.

477
00:21:43,942 --> 00:21:46,644
Hey. I, uh, I drank some in the elevator

478
00:21:46,712 --> 00:21:48,579
to, like, make it less weird.

479
00:21:48,614 --> 00:21:51,282
Oh! Wine!

480
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:52,950
Yeah, which is now embarrassing

481
00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:54,052
because I realize

482
00:21:54,086 --> 00:21:56,020
that I kind of set this up as a date,

483
00:21:56,055 --> 00:21:57,655
and it's definitely not a date.

484
00:21:57,723 --> 00:21:59,157
I mean, I didn't bother wearing pants,

485
00:21:59,191 --> 00:22:01,592
but it's really sweet.

486
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,829
Whoa! Oh, my God, is that your date food?

487
00:22:04,897 --> 00:22:07,770
- That is not...
- Oh, my God, Jackson.

488
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,895
No girl wants to take their clothes off

489
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,030
after eating cheese and cured meat.

490
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,500
Thanks for coming over
and openly mocking me.

491
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:16,802
This is... It's totally
acceptable date food.

492
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,770
Wait.

493
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:20,205
Is that Kenny G?

494
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,776
Do you only have
romantic soft pillow sex?

495
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:27,079
That's not... It's on, like, a shuffle.

496
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:29,781
Mm. Mm.

497
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:32,045
I hate you. Gimme that.

498
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:34,720
Wow.

499
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,555
What now?

500
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:39,258
No, I just realized I've never
dated a rich guy before.

501
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:40,692
I mean, doctors have money,

502
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:43,095
but you're, like, collect-art rich.

503
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,430
Wow, that would weird me out.

504
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,079
Well, it's a good thing that
we're not dating then, isn't it?

505
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:50,957
Right.

506
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:52,804
You're just a bridge.

507
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:55,199
I'm just a bridge.

508
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,016
Are you sure this is what you want?

509
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,784
Mm-hmm.

510
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:19,264
Are you... Oh, oh, okay.

511
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:20,465
We c... We should stop.

512
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,700
No, no, no, I'm okay. Let's keep going.

513
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,769
- I don't think... Jo...
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

514
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,504
It's okay. We should...
No, no, I really -

515
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:27,806
I really want to have sex with you.

516
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,042
I really do. Please, let's keep going.

517
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,310
Okay, listen, it's okay.

518
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:33,011
I think we can...
We can try another time.

519
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:34,880
I'm sorry.

520
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,415
- Sit down.
- I'm sorry.

521
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:37,883
I'll get you some water.

522
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:45,057
I'm so sorry.

523
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:46,658
No, you have nothing to be sorry about.

524
00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:48,627
Don't worry about it.

525
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:53,899
They said they wanted to talk to my boss.

526
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,133
Then tell them you're the boss next time.

527
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,903
- Really?
- Hello. I'm Dr. Miranda Bailey.

528
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,838
Uh, uh, Kayden Lee
is our son. He was in a fire.

529
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,840
Kayden is only 18. We should
be allowed to be in there.

530
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,976
I know this is a scary situation.

531
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,646
I'm a parent. Believe me,
I understand your frustration.

532
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:10,849
But you have my word as chief
that all of your children

533
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,518
are receiving the best possible care.

534
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,587
But we just need you to bear
with us a little while longer.

535
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,889
Excuse me. Uh, Aaron Morris.
Any word on Frankie?

536
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:19,560
Uh, which one is Frankie?

537
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,611
He's immunocompromised.
He got a kidney donation

538
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:23,528
for polycystic kidney disease
just two months ago.

539
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:24,796
He's high risk for Covid.

540
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,932
- Then why was he at a party?
- Schmitt.

541
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,947
- Frankie Morris.
- Yes.

542
00:24:28,982 --> 00:24:30,869
Uh, he must still be en route.

543
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,477
I'll look into it myself.

544
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:35,407
Tell Kayden he's not alone.
Mom and Dad are here.

545
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,776
I cannot do this, Steve.
I need to be with him.

546
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,178
He's our baby.

547
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:45,350
We still haven't heard
anything from her family?

548
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:46,918
Her family still live in Arizona,

549
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,187
sister goes to school in Portland.

550
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:51,456
I'm not sure if missing persons
was able to reach them.

551
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:52,958
Well, find out. I don't want her

552
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,360
waking up alone in an empty ICU!

553
00:24:55,395 --> 00:24:57,095
Go on!

554
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:00,766
Bailey, if this is too much
for you, I can take over.

555
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,934
I betrayed her once.
I'm not doing that again.

556
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:05,604
I looked her in the eye

557
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,306
and told DeLuca to send her home.

558
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,608
With a monster.

559
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,077
Well, you assessed the situation
as best you could.

560
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,712
And you were distracted
because DeLuca was...

561
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,981
DeLuca... I don't know what
we're gonna do with DeLuca.

562
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:19,851
I mean, I-I know what he's feeling.

563
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,820
At least in part.

564
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,823
I know what it feels like to want help

565
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,591
but be afraid of it at the same time.

566
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:29,661
Richard Webber all but put
the pills in my mouth.

567
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:32,831
I had given up, but he never did.

568
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:34,597
Well, maybe that's what we need to do.

569
00:25:34,681 --> 00:25:35,901
Just not give up.

570
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,769
Tissue grasper.

571
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,173
Frankie... Morris.

572
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,307
His father was notified

573
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,742
he was being brought here from the fire.

574
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,310
Frankie Morris. He's not here yet.

575
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,978
What did they do?

576
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,513
Stop for frozen yogurt on the way?

577
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,916
We're not even supposed
to be open to trauma.

578
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,350
You think he was turned away?

579
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,152
I'll try to find out.

580
00:25:54,187 --> 00:25:55,821
Uh, uh, Bailey.

581
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:57,443
Uh, ah.

582
00:25:57,537 --> 00:25:58,857
Um, I was thinking.

583
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,761
I saw some nurses wiping down
their masks with bleach.

584
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:03,922
Now, I know that can't be good,

585
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:05,197
so what I was wondering was can I...

586
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:08,066
You went through the whole stack
of safety precautions?

587
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,167
I-I-I... What was I say...

588
00:26:09,202 --> 00:26:11,937
You committed all
of those protocols to memory?

589
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,941
Look, this is no longer
the hospital that you left.

590
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:17,943
And if you're going to insist
on being here,

591
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:20,946
then you are going to need
to know how we operate now.

592
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,182
So when I tell you
to read the safety protocol,

593
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:26,852
I mean read the damn safety protocol!

594
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:37,270
Dr. Madigan to the Covid floor.

595
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,264
Dr. Madigan to the Covid floor.

596
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:48,802
Hey.

597
00:26:48,836 --> 00:26:50,237
Yeah, so when I said goodbye earlier,

598
00:26:50,271 --> 00:26:52,205
something kinda slipped out.

599
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,442
Hmm. You're gonna need
to be more specific.

600
00:26:55,476 --> 00:26:59,313
Oh, you mean when you dropped
a "love you" on me

601
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,347
and then jumped off our call?

602
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:03,250
Right, okay, so you heard.

603
00:27:03,284 --> 00:27:05,385
Yeah, so, um, s-so, yeah,

604
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,653
I wasn't really saying that to you.

605
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:08,488
That was to my colleague Kingsley.

606
00:27:08,523 --> 00:27:11,425
It's this little initiative
we started at my hospital.

607
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:12,859
It's kind of like a morale boost,

608
00:27:12,894 --> 00:27:14,261
so that the whole staff feels valued.

609
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:16,596
Oh, yeah, that makes way more sense

610
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:19,366
than you saying it to me
because that would be...

611
00:27:19,434 --> 00:27:21,735
Ridiculous, yeah, I know.

612
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:24,271
And maybe scare you away.

613
00:27:24,305 --> 00:27:25,766
For real, though. Did I freak you out?

614
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,308
Weirdly only a little.

615
00:27:28,343 --> 00:27:30,277
Okay, good.

616
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:32,579
Because if I lost
the one place in the world

617
00:27:32,613 --> 00:27:35,248
where I actually manage
to feel good during this mess,

618
00:27:35,283 --> 00:27:38,318
- I think I'd be done for.
- Me, too.

619
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:42,222
And somehow
you just made it more romantic

620
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:43,323
than saying "love."

621
00:27:43,358 --> 00:27:45,359
- See how I do?
- Hm.

622
00:27:45,393 --> 00:27:48,880
Talk later? If we're still alive.

623
00:28:13,488 --> 00:28:14,788
Excuse me.

624
00:28:14,822 --> 00:28:17,557
We have more signs in this place
than Times Square,

625
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:18,932
and they're very clear.

626
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:20,994
The few visitors we have right now

627
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:22,996
have to be accompanied
by a hospital employee.

628
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:24,998
So either you have been misplaced

629
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:26,580
or you're not supposed to be here.

630
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,568
My son is in here. Kayden Lee.

631
00:28:28,636 --> 00:28:30,437
I know it's against the rules
for me to be here,

632
00:28:30,505 --> 00:28:31,538
but he was burned.

633
00:28:31,572 --> 00:28:34,174
He was burned so badly
that he needs surgery.

634
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:37,177
He just turned 18, and I... And I...

635
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:38,712
And I know that means that he's an adult,

636
00:28:38,746 --> 00:28:41,948
that he drives a car
and he's dating someone,

637
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:43,517
and he does his own laundry

638
00:28:43,551 --> 00:28:45,452
because we wanted to make sure
of that before college.

639
00:28:45,486 --> 00:28:48,355
But he still has the same smile

640
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:50,323
that he had when he was a baby,

641
00:28:50,391 --> 00:28:53,794
and he still says "I love you"
before leaving the house,

642
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:54,995
and he won't shut the door

643
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:57,297
unless I say "I love you" back.

644
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:59,132
So he needs me.

645
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,835
He needs to hear my voice

646
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:03,804
and he'll know that I love him

647
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:07,441
and that everything is going to be okay.

648
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:13,647
I know what it's like
to worry about someone

649
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:16,249
so much you think it'll break you.

650
00:29:21,422 --> 00:29:23,657
- Come with me.
- Oh, thank you.

651
00:29:23,691 --> 00:29:25,959
Thank you.

652
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,003
What is this?

653
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:40,474
Andrew, the people in this room
love you, respect you,

654
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:43,477
and care about you,
and they want you to know that.

655
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:44,911
This is...

656
00:29:44,946 --> 00:29:47,647
No, no, humor us, please, please.

657
00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:54,054
A-A-Andrea, the day you were born,

658
00:29:54,088 --> 00:29:55,589
Nonna was babysitting me.

659
00:29:55,623 --> 00:29:58,425
And... And, uh, when she told me
I had a baby brother,

660
00:29:58,493 --> 00:30:00,560
I-I-I ran outside and I splashed around

661
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:02,195
in the puddles of rain and...

662
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,397
And shouted at the sky
because I was so happy.

663
00:30:04,465 --> 00:30:06,434
I, um...

664
00:30:07,969 --> 00:30:11,538
You... You will always be
my baby brother.

665
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:12,939
And I know you're hurting right now.

666
00:30:13,007 --> 00:30:14,574
I know that.

667
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:16,243
But you don't have to be.

668
00:30:16,277 --> 00:30:17,444
There is help for you.

669
00:30:17,478 --> 00:30:20,614
All of us want to help you.

670
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:26,219
DeLuca, even if you hadn't
saved my life, I'd be here.

671
00:30:26,254 --> 00:30:28,788
I've seen class after class
come through this program.

672
00:30:28,823 --> 00:30:34,628
I've done it enough to know when
someone has something special.

673
00:30:34,662 --> 00:30:35,962
Don't throw this away.

674
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,564
What seems like a weakness

675
00:30:37,598 --> 00:30:41,601
is actually a strength...
If you get help.

676
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:46,540
Because you care so deeply.

677
00:30:46,574 --> 00:30:49,476
You fight so hard for your patients,

678
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,396
for the people you love.

679
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:54,714
That's not illness. That's you.

680
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:59,319
You... You know I live with
obsessive compulsive disorder.

681
00:30:59,353 --> 00:31:00,849
But I take medication.

682
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:03,924
I get therapy, and I stay on top of it.

683
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:08,295
And, no, it is not always easy for me.

684
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:10,029
Look, you're not alone.

685
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:13,934
You have an illness,
but there's no shame in that.

686
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:16,236
- No shame?
- No.

687
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,270
That's a joke, right?

688
00:31:17,338 --> 00:31:19,072
Why do you think it's a joke?

689
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,519
To say there's no shame?

690
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,053
My whole life, I've had one goal.

691
00:31:24,545 --> 00:31:28,281
One thing that would mean I did okay.

692
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:30,383
Don't end up like my Dad.

693
00:31:32,687 --> 00:31:36,990
I wanted it more than being a surgeon.

694
00:31:38,025 --> 00:31:39,693
One thing.

695
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:42,028
And I just...

696
00:31:42,063 --> 00:31:43,105
I failed.

697
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,898
No, you're not like him.

698
00:31:44,932 --> 00:31:46,333
I don't care what you think, okay?

699
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:48,134
I don't care about Bailey's OCD.

700
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:49,703
I don't care about saving Richard's life.

701
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,938
I would give up every life
I have ever saved

702
00:31:51,973 --> 00:31:54,125
if I could just not feel like this.

703
00:31:54,909 --> 00:31:56,109
I'd give up knowing you!

704
00:31:56,143 --> 00:31:59,145
God!

705
00:32:07,281 --> 00:32:08,648
Hey.

706
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,192
Hey.

707
00:32:13,227 --> 00:32:15,862
I know I'm not okay.

708
00:32:17,865 --> 00:32:20,166
I just don't know what to do.

709
00:32:20,234 --> 00:32:24,571
Okay. You listen to the people
that know what to do

710
00:32:24,605 --> 00:32:26,473
and let them help you, Andrea.

711
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,741
Th-That's it.

712
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:39,312
All we're asking you to do

713
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:43,299
is fight as hard for yourself
as you do for everybody else.

714
00:32:54,735 --> 00:32:57,271
- Okay.
- Okay.

715
00:32:58,572 --> 00:32:59,639
Okay.

716
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:03,610
Perez.

717
00:33:03,644 --> 00:33:04,778
It's Grey.

718
00:33:04,812 --> 00:33:06,746
Get someone to cover your shift

719
00:33:06,814 --> 00:33:10,383
so you can walk Dora up
so she can say goodbye.

720
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:11,557
Yep, that's it.

721
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:13,053
Walk her up so she can say goodbye.

722
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:14,201
Thank you.

723
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,790
I'll clean all this up.

724
00:33:58,532 --> 00:34:01,134
I'll clean... that up.

725
00:34:04,205 --> 00:34:05,218
Hey.

726
00:34:14,282 --> 00:34:15,516
Where have you been?

727
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,852
I-I was at home.

728
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,689
If you're not here
and you don't answer your phone,

729
00:34:21,723 --> 00:34:23,591
then no one knows where you are

730
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:27,561
and nobody knows that you're okay.

731
00:34:27,596 --> 00:34:28,863
I turned the ringer off

732
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:30,531
and I crashed
the second I got home, okay?

733
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:32,433
The therapist says that if I don't sleep,

734
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:34,702
the mania can creep back in.

735
00:34:36,905 --> 00:34:38,272
Who died?

736
00:34:38,306 --> 00:34:39,916
Everyone.

737
00:34:40,408 --> 00:34:41,675
Marvin Lindstrom,

738
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,277
Doris Sanchez,

739
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:44,411
Tom Richardson.

740
00:34:44,446 --> 00:34:45,619
You treated him.

741
00:34:45,675 --> 00:34:47,381
Yeah, the retired choir director.

742
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:49,917
He... He loved fishing.

743
00:34:52,153 --> 00:34:54,472
And I'm sorry I wasn't here, Mer.

744
00:34:57,259 --> 00:34:59,226
You're okay?

745
00:34:59,261 --> 00:35:02,396
Yeah, I'm... I'm okay.

746
00:35:02,464 --> 00:35:04,698
I'm glad you're okay.

747
00:35:04,766 --> 00:35:06,200
Make sure people know where you are.

748
00:35:10,605 --> 00:35:13,641
So, Dr. Grey and I were able
to repair Erin's hernia,

749
00:35:13,675 --> 00:35:17,044
but there was a great deal
of inflammation in her abdomen.

750
00:35:17,112 --> 00:35:20,581
So we are giving her
a course of IV antibiotics.

751
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:21,949
You're going to have to say
all this again

752
00:35:22,017 --> 00:35:24,218
for my parents when they get here.

753
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:26,120
I still can't believe any of this.

754
00:35:26,187 --> 00:35:27,888
We... We looked for her forever.

755
00:35:27,923 --> 00:35:29,690
We looked for her everywhere.

756
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:33,961
Well, we can't stress enough
how much she's been through.

757
00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:36,797
She's going to need years
of support and therapy.

758
00:35:36,865 --> 00:35:38,165
Of course, whatever she needs.

759
00:35:38,233 --> 00:35:40,301
I'm not sure I'm gonna let her
out of my sight ag...

760
00:35:43,371 --> 00:35:44,397
Abby?

761
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,007
I'm here, Erin.

762
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:48,309
I'm here. Oh, my God.

763
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:54,615
I'm so sorry.

764
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:57,351
- I'm so sorry.
- It's not your fault.

765
00:35:57,419 --> 00:35:59,219
It's not your fault.

766
00:35:59,254 --> 00:36:01,021
It's not your fault.

767
00:36:17,055 --> 00:36:18,072
Kayden.

768
00:36:31,753 --> 00:36:33,721
What the hell are you doing?
You know that's not allowed.

769
00:36:33,755 --> 00:36:35,322
If Bailey asks, I'll tell her

770
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,391
that I didn't get to
that part of the manual.

771
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,294
Can you give her a couple minutes?

772
00:36:41,396 --> 00:36:43,330
Mama's here.

773
00:36:43,365 --> 00:36:45,249
Can you hear me?

774
00:36:45,934 --> 00:36:49,069
I'm here, and I love you.

775
00:36:49,503 --> 00:36:51,472
I love you, too.

776
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:01,248
Richard.

777
00:37:01,282 --> 00:37:02,349
O-O-Okay, I know
it's just a start, but...

778
00:37:02,384 --> 00:37:04,251
If you haven't gotten through
the new protocols,

779
00:37:04,285 --> 00:37:05,419
then I'm not interested.

780
00:37:05,453 --> 00:37:08,756
You are not my mother,
and you are not my teacher.

781
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,891
You are my colleague
and you are my friend...

782
00:37:10,925 --> 00:37:12,259
And I am your boss.

783
00:37:12,293 --> 00:37:14,495
I am your boss and it is my job to...

784
00:37:14,562 --> 00:37:16,430
Well, don't tell me what your job is.

785
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:17,631
I taught you your job.

786
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:19,767
I taught you your whole damn job.

787
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:22,029
And now suddenly you don't
want to let me do mine?

788
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,471
I brought you down here
for some good news,

789
00:37:24,506 --> 00:37:25,606
but you're convinced that I'm...

790
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,875
I'm incompetent and infirm,
and you won't even hear it.

791
00:37:27,909 --> 00:37:29,843
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What good news?

792
00:37:31,913 --> 00:37:35,049
Your staff is reusing PPE,

793
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,111
and cleaning them with bacterial wipes...

794
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:39,887
- Yeah.
- ...which deteriorates the mask.

795
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,459
Now they don't have to.

796
00:37:45,493 --> 00:37:47,027
You're welcome.

797
00:37:47,062 --> 00:37:49,463
Oh, my God.

798
00:37:50,665 --> 00:37:52,700
It's genius.

799
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:56,203
- You're genius.
- I know.

800
00:37:56,271 --> 00:37:57,738
I'm not sure how you forgot.

801
00:37:57,772 --> 00:38:00,449
I did not.

802
00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:03,277
And it's not about your ability, Richard.

803
00:38:03,311 --> 00:38:04,778
It's about your vulnerability.

804
00:38:04,813 --> 00:38:07,414
You know you are high risk
for Covid right now.

805
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:09,950
Look, you have already given
more of yourself

806
00:38:09,984 --> 00:38:12,419
to this hospital than anyone ever could.

807
00:38:12,454 --> 00:38:15,089
And you have overcome, you have suffered,

808
00:38:15,156 --> 00:38:18,592
and you are why this hospital
is as good as it is today.

809
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,228
Y-You're why I am as good as I am today.

810
00:38:21,296 --> 00:38:25,632
And you, Richard, have earned
the right to stay home,

811
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:28,969
to stay safe, and to rest.

812
00:38:29,003 --> 00:38:30,504
This thing, it's...

813
00:38:30,538 --> 00:38:34,608
It's... It's...
It's only going to get worse.

814
00:38:36,144 --> 00:38:38,812
Every relationship
I've ever had has failed.

815
00:38:40,148 --> 00:38:42,116
Except this one.

816
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,785
And this place.

817
00:38:46,221 --> 00:38:47,855
I will find no peace...

818
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:50,332
No peace...

819
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:52,693
If I have to leave it.

820
00:38:52,727 --> 00:38:55,429
You...

821
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:57,431
are going to give me
a second heart attack,

822
00:38:57,465 --> 00:38:58,532
you know that?

823
00:38:58,566 --> 00:39:00,501
Bailey...

824
00:39:00,535 --> 00:39:02,269
...you know I got to tell you

825
00:39:02,337 --> 00:39:05,672
that this place couldn't ask
for a better chief.

826
00:39:05,707 --> 00:39:07,407
I'm in awe.

827
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:09,943
Even though I taught you most of it.

828
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:11,563
You know...

829
00:39:26,861 --> 00:39:28,412
Hey.

830
00:39:29,264 --> 00:39:30,197
Hey.

831
00:39:30,231 --> 00:39:31,799
How's he doing?

832
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:33,567
- Well, he's stable.
- Okay.

833
00:39:33,601 --> 00:39:35,536
I think his visit from his mom helped.

834
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,870
Right.

835
00:39:39,374 --> 00:39:41,508
I'd like to apologize to you
if that'll help.

836
00:39:41,543 --> 00:39:43,710
I mean, I'm not exactly sure what I did

837
00:39:43,745 --> 00:39:47,181
to make you so angry, but...
Angry? I'm - No, I'm not angry.

838
00:39:47,215 --> 00:39:50,059
I... I was just hot.

839
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,489
Jackson.

840
00:39:55,523 --> 00:39:57,891
I am mortified.

841
00:39:57,926 --> 00:40:00,561
All the time, every minute
that I'm around you.

842
00:40:00,628 --> 00:40:05,232
I... cried into your mouth.

843
00:40:05,266 --> 00:40:09,536
I mean, I'm... I'm pretty sure
that I snotted in your mouth.

844
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:11,538
And I-I... You were trying
to do me a favor

845
00:40:11,573 --> 00:40:15,576
- and I just... I...
- It was a favor you weren't ready for.

846
00:40:15,643 --> 00:40:18,045
- I really wasn't.
- It's fine. You...

847
00:40:18,112 --> 00:40:19,780
Look, you've been through hell, okay?

848
00:40:19,814 --> 00:40:21,014
You were doing your best.

849
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:22,533
You're still doing your best.

850
00:40:22,568 --> 00:40:25,485
And we are, um, friends.

851
00:40:26,487 --> 00:40:30,424
So if you can get over the mortification

852
00:40:30,449 --> 00:40:33,585
and stop treating me like crap,
I figure we're all good.

853
00:40:33,661 --> 00:40:35,629
Can we just pretend it never happened?

854
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,580
Done.

855
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:40,860
Okay. Alright.

856
00:40:45,673 --> 00:40:47,140
I saw Kayden.

857
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:48,575
It's bad.

858
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:52,165
He was so bandaged

859
00:40:52,205 --> 00:40:54,081
that I couldn't see his face.

860
00:40:54,115 --> 00:40:57,284
- One second, okay. Hi, um, Mr. Morris.
- Yes?

861
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:00,354
Hey, your son Frankie was taken
to Seattle Presbyterian

862
00:41:00,388 --> 00:41:02,265
because we're a Covid center...
Oh, my God.

863
00:41:02,342 --> 00:41:04,845
No, they are understaffed,

864
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:06,593
so they turned away his ambulance.

865
00:41:06,628 --> 00:41:08,295
- Are you kidding me?
- I've been in touch with my husband,

866
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:09,496
who is a first responder.

867
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,064
They're bringing him back here.

868
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,667
He is stable, right?
He should be here momentarily.

869
00:41:13,701 --> 00:41:15,235
Oh, my God.

870
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,571
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay?

871
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:19,907
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

872
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,111
Hey, Mr. Bronson said his wife was here,

873
00:41:24,145 --> 00:41:25,445
but I can't find her.

874
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,315
Can you just let her know
that his O.R.I.F. went fine?

875
00:41:30,518 --> 00:41:32,661
I hope you're doing okay.

876
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:35,255
Because I'm not.

877
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:37,624
I hit 100 this morning.

878
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:39,693
100 times I've had to tell someone

879
00:41:39,727 --> 00:41:41,662
that their loved one has died.

880
00:41:41,696 --> 00:41:43,697
That's 10 times as much as I've had to do

881
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:44,859
since I started here.

882
00:41:44,906 --> 00:41:46,986
And it's making me wonder how much longer

883
00:41:47,025 --> 00:41:52,706
I can keep doing this
because 100 is a... big number.

884
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,677
And I'm afraid of getting to
a place where it's not so big.

885
00:41:56,711 --> 00:41:58,545
And I know that we're not together,

886
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:02,316
but you're still a person
that I care about and...

887
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,750
I don't know.

888
00:42:03,785 --> 00:42:06,520
I-I-I thought that you might
want to know how I'm doing.

889
00:42:06,554 --> 00:42:08,622
Which is terrible.

890
00:42:09,691 --> 00:42:11,792
And I really hope that you're okay.

891
00:42:16,764 --> 00:42:17,831
I'm fine.

892
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,335
No, Conor said Kayden started the fire.

893
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:24,071
Oh, so it's... It's his fault?

894
00:42:24,105 --> 00:42:25,639
They shouldn't have even been out there,

895
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:26,907
but they felt sorry for Frankie.

896
00:42:26,975 --> 00:42:28,875
Wait a minute. You think
that this is Frankie's fault?

897
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,544
Posting all the time about how sad he is

898
00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:31,745
he can't be with his friends.

899
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:33,580
He missed a year of school
when he was sick.

900
00:42:33,614 --> 00:42:35,716
Of course he wanted to see his friends.

901
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,817
And, hey, I don't need a lecture

902
00:42:36,851 --> 00:42:38,085
from Mr. Lakehouse here, okay?

903
00:42:38,152 --> 00:42:39,586
Okay, everyone, let's just settle.

904
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,388
We all follow each other on Instagram.

905
00:42:41,422 --> 00:42:43,757
Did you really think we weren't
gonna see you grilling

906
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:46,093
every night with half the neighborhood?

907
00:42:46,127 --> 00:42:47,561
And no one in masks!

908
00:42:47,628 --> 00:42:49,196
You know, kids learn by example.

909
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,864
Well, Kayden's example
is a selfish moron.

910
00:42:50,898 --> 00:42:53,567
Stop, both of you!

911
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:55,836
- Steve, stop! Cut it out right now!
- Schmitt, call security!

912
00:42:55,903 --> 00:42:59,406
Disaster has a tendency
to melt away everything else in life.

913
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,608
Selfish son of a bitch!

914
00:43:01,642 --> 00:43:03,610
Steve!

915
00:43:03,644 --> 00:43:06,580
So if you want to know
who you'll be in a disaster,

916
00:43:06,647 --> 00:43:09,416
- ask yourself...
- Security!

917
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,918
...who am I now?

918
00:43:12,305 --> 00:44:12,282

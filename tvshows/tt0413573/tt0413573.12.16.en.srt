1
00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:03,892
Don't be scared.

2
00:00:04,445 --> 00:00:07,180
I have no idea how many
times I've said it.

3
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:12,119
The intern stands over a patient with
a scalpel or a needle or a clamp,

4
00:00:12,153 --> 00:00:13,720
afraid to make the first move.

5
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:16,456
Told you it wasn't that far.

6
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:19,326
Curb, front door. What's that...
50 feet, about?

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,827
It's a nice 50 feet.

8
00:00:20,862 --> 00:00:22,095
Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:26,000
- So, help me out. Which date was this?
- Why?

10
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:28,403
Well, I need to know
what to put in my diary.

11
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,307
Well, there was one, and
then there was another,

12
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,942
so I'm pretty sure that makes two.

13
00:00:33,976 --> 00:00:35,976
And what about the, uh, car
ride home the other night?

14
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:37,547
I could barely keep my eyes open.

15
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:39,115
Well, we ate. We talked.

16
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,785
We laughed, which was date-like.

17
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:44,020
Why does it matter?

18
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:46,356
Three's my lucky number.

19
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,991
They're scared.

20
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:51,027
Well then I guess you're...

21
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:52,562
out of luck.

22
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:53,697
Mm.

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,347
They know what to do. But they
just need that little push.

24
00:01:01,598 --> 00:01:02,672
Wait.

25
00:01:05,878 --> 00:01:07,479
You didn't say good night.

26
00:01:07,513 --> 00:01:09,881
Oh, how thoughtless.

27
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:13,051
Hug me.

28
00:01:16,122 --> 00:01:17,889
Good night.

29
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:20,058
Good night.

30
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:42,381
Just hang in there, okay?

31
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:44,216
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

32
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:06,638
Aw.

33
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:07,806
Early rounds.

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,408
I know. I know.

35
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,878
- Good night.
- Good night.

36
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:20,752
Thank you.

37
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:32,998
What, are you sneaking out on me?

38
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:34,289
Oh, hey.

39
00:02:34,315 --> 00:02:35,382
Sorry.

40
00:02:35,407 --> 00:02:36,726
Give me a minute. I can...

41
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:38,737
get some coffee.

42
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:40,105
Actually, I-I can't.

43
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,340
I'm assisting Bailey on
that Heller myotomy today.

44
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,409
Oh, that's right. That's today.

45
00:02:44,444 --> 00:02:47,279
Well, text me right after. I
want to know all about it.

46
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:48,414
Okay.

47
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,916
Hello?

48
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:51,249
Oh.

49
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:05,297
Get out! Get out! Go!

50
00:03:05,331 --> 00:03:06,965
Get out! Just get out!

51
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:08,767
Please, just get out! What is going on?!

52
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:09,873
I-I-I don't know.

53
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,786
She just started screaming.

54
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:12,321
Why are you here?! Why
is she screaming?!

55
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:13,456
Get him out of here!

56
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,157
What did you do?!

57
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:15,658
Nothing! God, no, nothing!

58
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:16,826
We were sleeping. I was sleeping,

59
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,560
and then the screaming. I...

60
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:18,394
Mer?

61
00:03:18,428 --> 00:03:20,730
Mer, are you okay? What's happening?

62
00:03:20,764 --> 00:03:22,465
- Get him out of here.
- Who's he?

63
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:24,333
Look, just for the record,
I didn't do anything.

64
00:03:24,368 --> 00:03:25,635
Get him out of here!

65
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:28,104
- My shoes are in there...
- Get... out!

66
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:33,576
Mer?

67
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,711
Mer, he's gone.

68
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:38,047
Can you please open the door?
I am worried about you.

69
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:39,455
I want to know that you're okay.

70
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,218
Is he gone?

71
00:03:42,252 --> 00:03:45,021
Yeah. Yeah, he's gone.

72
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:52,161
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

73
00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:58,234
Move the V.P. shunt till Monday.

74
00:03:58,268 --> 00:04:00,002
Got it. Anything else?

75
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:02,572
All right, I'll be in touch.

76
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:04,040
Shepherd not coming in today?

77
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:05,174
No.

78
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:06,709
Is she sick, or...

79
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:09,545
I don't know. Uh, I'll
tell her you asked.

80
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,347
Uh, yes. Thank you. That's...

81
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:14,617
Ashley Hughes, 21,

82
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:17,019
crush injuries with
bilateral hip dislocations.

83
00:04:17,054 --> 00:04:18,054
Good distal pulses.

84
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:20,456
- How'd it happen?
- Fell on me.

85
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,458
- What? What fell on you?
- I did.

86
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:24,594
Whoa. Uh, y-you okay there?

87
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:26,596
You're bleeding pretty
bad from that head lac.

88
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,464
D-Don't worry about me.
Just make sure she's okay.

89
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:31,100
Let's get her inside.
Somebody page Torres!

90
00:04:31,134 --> 00:04:32,735
So, the Rotko kid looks pretty good,

91
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,103
but I want to monitor him overnight.

92
00:04:34,137 --> 00:04:35,738
You said we should do something.

93
00:04:35,772 --> 00:04:37,166
We are. We're monitoring
the kid overnight.

94
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:39,875
About April. It was your idea.

95
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,477
"Something." I said, "Something."

96
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:43,646
I didn't say, go behind her
back and tell Jackson.

97
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:46,949
April.

98
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:48,618
Hi. Uh, good morning.

99
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:51,053
Um, we're gonna take the next one.

100
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:52,388
Oh.

101
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:54,457
Okay.

102
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:01,497
Yeah, well, maybe next time,
be a little more specific.

103
00:05:09,673 --> 00:05:12,908
You know how long it's been
since I saw your mother?

104
00:05:12,943 --> 00:05:14,644
No idea, sir.

105
00:05:14,678 --> 00:05:16,679
Too long!

106
00:05:16,713 --> 00:05:18,681
Her plane lands any minute.

107
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:22,151
Yeah, I'm sure that trip's a
complete coincidence, right?

108
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:23,753
Nothing to do with me or...

109
00:05:23,787 --> 00:05:24,954
her or... I don't know...

110
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:26,589
anything you might have mentioned.

111
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:29,258
Um, my wife and I

112
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:31,694
don't have any secrets
between us, Jackson.

113
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:35,765
I enjoy seeing her, and
she enjoys seeing you.

114
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:40,002
Now, if you feel otherwise...

115
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:41,637
that's a damn shame.

116
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:48,878
Your injuries are not that bad,
but Ashley's are pretty severe.

117
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:50,613
Can you walk us through
exactly what happened?

118
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:54,050
I don't really think that's...

119
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:57,953
I mean, you know, Ashley, she...
she... she's a lady.

120
00:05:57,988 --> 00:06:01,457
Mm-hmm, and you and the lady were...

121
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:04,827
Listen, it is easier for
us to treat her properly

122
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:07,797
if we know how the injuries happened.

123
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:09,865
I don't want to kiss and tell.

124
00:06:12,436 --> 00:06:14,403
He's funny, cute, and sweet,

125
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:15,738
and so I thought, "What if he's big?"

126
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:17,206
I'm an athlete.

127
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,141
I ran the New York City
Marathon the fastest

128
00:06:19,176 --> 00:06:20,042
of anyone in my age group,

129
00:06:20,077 --> 00:06:21,844
and don't back down from a challenge.

130
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:22,778
Maybe you should've backed
down from this one.

131
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:24,714
Hey, you shouldn't say things like that.

132
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:26,649
People make assumptions
based on size all the time.

133
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:28,584
I mean, so, what, I just
shouldn't date big people

134
00:06:28,618 --> 00:06:29,985
just because I'm little?!

135
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,921
I really like him. He's a gentleman.

136
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:34,256
She asked me over to her place.

137
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,858
I was sort of surprised.

138
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:38,728
I mean, obviously, the size
difference crossed my mind.

139
00:06:38,762 --> 00:06:40,863
But I am not a quitter.

140
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:43,933
I was staring at Mount Everest,
and I was ready to climb.

141
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,702
I'm sorry. I'm not really
comfortable talking about this.

142
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:48,270
So, my legs were on his shoulders.

143
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:49,839
It was a lovely evening.

144
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:52,174
And my feet were, like,
way up in the air,

145
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:55,544
and it took some finessing at
first, but I was determined.

146
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:56,579
And it was worth it.

147
00:06:56,613 --> 00:07:00,282
Oh, my God, it was so
worth it, until

148
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:01,117
I slipped.

149
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:02,551
Boom!

150
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:04,754
Then her legs... snapped.

151
00:07:07,224 --> 00:07:09,392
It was... terrible.

152
00:07:09,426 --> 00:07:10,192
It was terrible!

153
00:07:10,227 --> 00:07:12,695
Ohh!

154
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:14,196
But this is way worse.

155
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:15,798
Okay, her pain's still not controlled.

156
00:07:15,832 --> 00:07:16,966
Well, she's maxed out on meds.

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,261
We'll have to reduce her under general.

158
00:07:18,277 --> 00:07:19,911
Uh, no, but then we'd
have to intubate her.

159
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:21,446
Uh, Warren!

160
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,081
Warren, I need your help in here.

161
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:25,550
Okay, Ashley, I know that
you are really hurting,

162
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:26,618
and I can help that

163
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:29,287
if you think that you can
handle a lot of pain...

164
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,724
...right now, all at once, okay?

165
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:34,960
We need to get your legs back into
your sockets. The sooner the better.

166
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:36,861
Now, we can go to the
operating room, or we can...

167
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:38,797
Might as well get it over with.

168
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,699
It's your call.

169
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:43,301
Go big or go home, right?

170
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:44,970
All right.

171
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:46,371
Edwards, you, uh, do the left leg.

172
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:47,639
- I'll do the right. Can you...
- Mm-hmm.

173
00:07:47,673 --> 00:07:49,074
We're gonna do them both at once?

174
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:50,308
No need to put her through this twice.

175
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:53,745
All right, Warren, I'm gonna
need you to hold her in place.

176
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,982
All right. Hang in there.

177
00:07:57,016 --> 00:07:59,050
- You're almost there.
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

178
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:00,252
- No!
- All right, is everyone ready?

179
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:01,620
- Yep.
- Ready.

180
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:03,088
All right, on the count of three.

181
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:05,223
1, 2... 3!

182
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:07,292
Aaaaaah!

183
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:09,425
She can't stay locked
away up there all day.

184
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,650
She has to come down sometime.

185
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:13,286
Do you think she wants food or
just coffee, or not coffee?

186
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,989
What if she wants tea?
Tea is more soothing.

187
00:08:15,107 --> 00:08:16,145
What do we know about this guy?

188
00:08:16,177 --> 00:08:17,044
I mean, not very much.

189
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:18,545
I mean, she's barely even dating him.

190
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,313
It's... Hi.

191
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:22,216
How are you?

192
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,053
Um, uh, we made coffee,
but we could make tea.

193
00:08:26,555 --> 00:08:27,889
Are you okay?

194
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:29,958
Where do we keep the stuff
for the countertops?

195
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:30,859
What?

196
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:31,960
The blue stuff, you know,

197
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:34,062
the... to clean the countertops
that's safe for kids.

198
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,664
Uh, used to be behind the paper towels.

199
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:39,400
Uh, Meredith, what happened?

200
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,668
How can we help you?

201
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,036
I found it.

202
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,405
Meredith.

203
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,009
You are wondering why I'm here.

204
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:50,354
I crashed here last night.

205
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:52,514
And the night before... on the couch.

206
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,215
I thought I'd be out
before you woke up, but...

207
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,383
Can I use this on the stovetop?

208
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:56,851
Sure.

209
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,756
Thing is probably covered
in 10 years of grease.

210
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,224
Uh...

211
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:04,726
I'm sorry I didn't ask before.

212
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,528
I just needed a place
to stay for a minute,

213
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,663
but I'm gonna grab my stuff
and I'm gonna go now.

214
00:09:08,697 --> 00:09:10,532
No, it's Owen. Something
happened with Owen,

215
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:11,900
and it really shook her up, so...

216
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:13,101
Maggie!

217
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,769
Look, you told me, and...

218
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:17,105
Yeah, and now I wish I hadn't.

219
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,439
I'm leaving.

220
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,108
No, please stay!

221
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,076
Something happened to you,

222
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:24,012
and now something has
happened to Meredith,

223
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:26,348
and I think that we
should all just sit down

224
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:29,017
and talk about it, all right?

225
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:31,152
Can I use bleach in here?

226
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:35,895
There's something we use under the sink.

227
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,827
I can show you.

228
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:41,897
Yeah.

229
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,523
We're taking Ashley up to C.T. now.

230
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:51,425
Torres would like you to join.

231
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:52,694
I'll be there in a few more minutes.

232
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:57,034
I almost killed her.

233
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,807
With our sex.

234
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:03,237
Dr. Blake! I need some help.

235
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:04,319
I paged Dr. Torres,

236
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,821
but she just ran a trauma
patient up to C.T., and...

237
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,691
Okay, let me see what you got.

238
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:11,159
Oh, God.

239
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,696
Uh, yes, Dr. Torres, or did you try Dr.
Robbins?

240
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,531
Dr. Robbins is in surgery.

241
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:19,200
So I figured since you and Dr.
Torres are...

242
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:22,337
Oh, right. Okay.

243
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,571
I've got it.

244
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:26,608
Hi.

245
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:28,710
She was having a play
date with my daughter,

246
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:30,478
and they were running
around, and she tripped.

247
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:31,446
Landed on a rock.

248
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,547
I brought her right in.

249
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:34,048
She's okay, right?

250
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,351
Hi, sweetie.

251
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,319
I am Dr. Blake.

252
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:40,321
I'm Sofia Sloan-Torres.

253
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:42,857
I know. I work with your mom.

254
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,559
Your moms.

255
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:45,793
My head hurts.

256
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:46,961
Okay.

257
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:49,497
Let's take a look at that cut.

258
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,535
Okay.

259
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,703
That doesn't look bad at all.

260
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:59,674
It is so cold and sleeting

261
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,976
back east... just dreadful!

262
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:03,711
So you came to Seattle for some sun?

263
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,713
I came to Seattle for my son.

264
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,514
Mm.

265
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:08,583
How are things going with April?

266
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:10,685
Why must you meddle in everything?

267
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,588
I do believe you went
through an entire divorce

268
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:15,323
without me saying one word.

269
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:17,592
Oh, Jackson, I just want to talk to her.

270
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:18,893
Nope, absolutely not.

271
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,595
Oh, come on, honey, let me help.

272
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:21,863
You won't help, though, Mom.

273
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:23,431
You'll only make things worse.

274
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:26,114
Now, I cannot be any clearer
with you about this.

275
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:27,350
No.

276
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:28,884
I don't want you talking to April.

277
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,395
I don't want you bullying her around.

278
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,355
I don't want you anywhere
near it, actually, okay?

279
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:35,491
It's my problem, my business, not yours.

280
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,360
Understood?

281
00:11:47,571 --> 00:11:49,872
Zola and Bailey are dropped off.

282
00:11:49,906 --> 00:11:51,040
Is Ellis still down?

283
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:52,375
Sound asleep.

284
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:57,480
And we are cleaning in here now.

285
00:11:57,514 --> 00:12:01,517
We are done in the kitchen,
so we have moved on.

286
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:03,319
Okay.

287
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:04,387
Well...

288
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:06,555
pass the disinfectant.

289
00:12:09,226 --> 00:12:10,993
DeLuca got out of here
in a hurry this morning.

290
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:13,496
Yeah, he's scrubbing in
on a Heller myotomy.

291
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,364
He's doing the esophageal dissection.

292
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,401
Where's the wood polish?

293
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:20,202
Here you go.

294
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:22,171
I told him to let me know how it goes,

295
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:24,607
so I'm just waiting for a text.

296
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:26,776
Owen won't stop texting.

297
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,111
And calling.

298
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:31,180
What are you gonna do?

299
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:33,449
I have no idea.

300
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:36,385
Yeah, I wouldn't know what to do either.

301
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:40,890
You know Owen probably
better than any of us.

302
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:43,592
Do you have any advice for Amelia?

303
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:47,730
How long has that stain been there?

304
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:56,405
You're keeping busy.

305
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,541
I am hiding.

306
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:00,443
Catherine Avery is here, apparently,

307
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:03,079
and I am not in the mood for...

308
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:07,450
In the E.R., I'm a sitting
duck, but in an O.R...

309
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:09,218
Come on, she can't be that bad.

310
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:10,453
No, she's worse than bad.

311
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:11,587
She can be terrifying.

312
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:12,822
Like a... hurricane.

313
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:15,558
When she hits, you do not
want to be in her wake.

314
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:17,126
Well, you can't avoid her forever,

315
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,662
not when she's about to
become Hurricane Granny.

316
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:23,265
Maybe not, but...

317
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,101
I can avoid her for now.

318
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:28,070
You ready? My first surgery's with you.

319
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:32,608
She has a femoral neck
fracture on the right hip.

320
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:34,910
It didn't show up on the plain films.

321
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:37,480
I met a puppy once that
was half German Shepherd,

322
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:39,482
half Teacup Chihuahua.

323
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:41,350
And all I could think was...

324
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:42,918
how did you happen?

325
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:44,587
I once watched this monster truck

326
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:47,323
crush this two-seater
convertible at an intersection,

327
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:49,325
and the truck barely
had a scratch on it,

328
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,860
but the convertible was totaled.

329
00:13:50,894 --> 00:13:53,429
I mean, logistically, if
the Chihuahua is the dad,

330
00:13:53,463 --> 00:13:55,698
does he just hop up on
the German Shepherd mom?

331
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:58,434
Ashley was just out for a joy ride...

332
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:01,003
with her top down, and them bam...

333
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:02,471
head-on collision.

334
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:03,506
Or is the German Shepherd the dad

335
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,641
and they give a ladder to
the little Chihuahua mom

336
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:06,809
so that he can reach her?

337
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:08,244
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop, stop, stop!

338
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:08,711
No.

339
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:10,179
These are scientific questions.

340
00:14:10,213 --> 00:14:11,714
No, not you... the scanner.

341
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:16,018
Look at her right leg.

342
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:18,721
It's pale and cold.

343
00:14:18,755 --> 00:14:19,555
No distal pulse.

344
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:20,656
We need a gurney in here!

345
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,824
- Book an O.R.
- Right away.

346
00:14:21,858 --> 00:14:23,159
W-What... What's happening?

347
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:26,195
Ashley, I stopped the scan
because I saw something concerning.

348
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:28,197
The blood flow to your
right leg is compromised,

349
00:14:28,231 --> 00:14:30,332
and that's not good, so...
just hang in there, Ashley.

350
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:31,534
All right, come on, come on.

351
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:33,335
On the count of three. 1, 2, 3!

352
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,236
Let's move.

353
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,426
Looks like the leg is pinking up.

354
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:41,118
Oh, caught it just in time.

355
00:14:41,153 --> 00:14:43,145
You know, gosh, it sounds fun,

356
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,040
but you do not want to run into
a German Shepherd in the wild.

357
00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:49,376
- Happened to me in college.
- Uh, irrigation?

358
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,911
I don't think this conversation
is entirely appropriate.

359
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:53,005
No, it's not.

360
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:54,476
K-wire, continue.

361
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:55,957
Yeah, I was at a party, met a guy,

362
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:59,418
took him home, and when
his pants came off...

363
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:02,888
my jaw hit the floor and so did... it.

364
00:15:02,922 --> 00:15:05,190
Oh, that is... not okay.

365
00:15:05,224 --> 00:15:06,291
That is what I said.

366
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:07,426
I said, "Get out of here,

367
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,460
and you take that thing with you."

368
00:15:08,494 --> 00:15:09,552
How big could it have been?

369
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:11,533
Okay, can we not?

370
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:13,135
Yeah.

371
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:14,503
Oh, wow.

372
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:16,238
Nope, nope.

373
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:17,506
That's... Yeah, yeah.

374
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,607
- Dr. Torres?
- Yeah.

375
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:20,876
It's not urgent, but they're
calling from the E.R.

376
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,286
Your daughter's down
there with a head lac.

377
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:22,745
What?!

378
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:23,846
I can take over. You go.

379
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,847
Yeah.

380
00:15:32,956 --> 00:15:34,990
When I was
pregnant with Jackson,

381
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:36,992
a 3-hour surgery felt like 12.

382
00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:39,561
Hi, Catherine. Um...

383
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:41,063
I actually don't really have much time

384
00:15:41,097 --> 00:15:42,765
'cause I have another
surgery really soon...

385
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,266
Oh, baby, please, sit back down.

386
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,901
Come on. I know you're tired.

387
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:46,769
It's okay.

388
00:15:46,803 --> 00:15:48,437
Come on.

389
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:50,572
Some nights, my feet were so swollen,

390
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:54,076
I was physically unable to
even take my sneakers off.

391
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,912
A few times, I slept in the damn things.

392
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,417
I...I guess you talked to Jackson.

393
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:04,753
Oh, let's not talk about him.

394
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:07,923
I want to know about you.

395
00:16:07,957 --> 00:16:09,725
How many weeks is it now?

396
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,527
Uh...

397
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:13,095
It's okay.

398
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:14,930
We don't have to talk about
it if you don't want to.

399
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:17,866
I-I understand. I'll go.

400
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:20,469
13.

401
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:24,153
I'm c-coming up on 13.

402
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:26,456
Morning sickness?

403
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,458
Um, no.

404
00:16:28,492 --> 00:16:31,561
I've... I've actually been
really lucky with that so far.

405
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:32,829
You a lucky.

406
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:34,697
I couldn't stop being sick.

407
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:37,900
I thought I was coming down with
the stomach flu or something.

408
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:41,037
Took a whole week for me to
realize I was having a baby.

409
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:42,572
It was a shock.

410
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:47,810
Yes, uh, uh, it's definitely startling.

411
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:49,912
Yeah, the morning that the
test turned positive,

412
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:51,714
I couldn't believe I had to turn around

413
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:53,583
and keep it together that day.

414
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:56,853
I bet.

415
00:16:56,887 --> 00:16:59,389
I was already...

416
00:16:59,423 --> 00:17:01,357
so emotional.

417
00:17:01,392 --> 00:17:04,894
But I was not gonna cry in
that lawyer's office, so...

418
00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:06,896
Oh, honey.

419
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,998
You mean you found out the same day

420
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:11,801
you signed the divorce papers?

421
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:16,739
Yeah, it was a rough day.

422
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:18,941
I just sat there listening
to those lawyers,

423
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:21,377
but all I could think
about was how I just...

424
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:25,132
I just... I needed time to...

425
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:25,748
think.

426
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:26,851
Mm.

427
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:28,110
Process.

428
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:32,955
I would've done the exact same thing.

429
00:17:35,893 --> 00:17:40,763
Sweetheart, no matter happens...

430
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,365
Everything looks good here.

431
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,066
All right, let's hope
that we don't come back

432
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:45,401
to the E.R. for a while, okay?

433
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:48,070
Thank you for taking

434
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:49,739
such good care of her.

435
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:52,742
See you in a bit, okay?

436
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:57,213
You okay?

437
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,981
Okay? Of course.

438
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:02,418
And, uh, Sofia is okay, which
is what really matters.

439
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:04,220
Okay.

440
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:06,422
I mean, it... it... it would've
been nice to get a page,

441
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:08,090
um, before you treated her.

442
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,492
Well, I just wanted to make sure

443
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:11,427
I had all the information
before I pulled you out.

444
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:12,462
No, right, of course.

445
00:18:12,496 --> 00:18:13,596
Or you could've tried Karev.

446
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,499
He's in peds, or Grey, who
Sofia's grown up knowing.

447
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,634
Grey has the day off,
and Karev just left.

448
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:19,869
Or Bailey.

449
00:18:19,903 --> 00:18:22,939
You wanted me to page the Chief
of Surgery for a head lac?

450
00:18:22,973 --> 00:18:24,841
Mm-hmm.

451
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,509
What's going on?

452
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:29,946
She's my kid, and...

453
00:18:31,148 --> 00:18:33,649
...she doesn't know anything about you.

454
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:36,252
We haven't even had that conversation.

455
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:37,820
Oh.

456
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:40,523
- So...
- Okay.

457
00:18:40,557 --> 00:18:44,026
This is about what I said
last night, isn't it?

458
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:48,364
The last thing that I wanted
to do was make things weird.

459
00:18:48,398 --> 00:18:49,932
It's Arizona.

460
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:51,100
She's glad that you helped.

461
00:18:51,134 --> 00:18:53,035
Obviously, she's not mad,
but she's not ready either.

462
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,670
You and I, it's all happening so fast,

463
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:56,205
and we're so new, and...

464
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,840
- Oh, God.
- No, that's...

465
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,942
What was I thinking?
It's fine, it's fine.

466
00:18:59,977 --> 00:19:01,477
Your heart was in the right place,

467
00:19:01,512 --> 00:19:02,879
and she'll be ready one day.

468
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:04,814
Okay, absolutely.

469
00:19:06,216 --> 00:19:09,218
I'm sorry.

470
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:10,486
I can wait.

471
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,328
What vacuum cleaner is this complicated?

472
00:19:19,363 --> 00:19:20,863
It's a carpet steamer.

473
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:22,031
And we own it?!

474
00:19:22,065 --> 00:19:23,499
Assembly.

475
00:19:23,534 --> 00:19:25,034
"Insert handle into machine base.

476
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:27,403
Press down firmly."

477
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:29,539
Okay. Bolts.

478
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:33,342
And circle thingy.

479
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:35,645
What happened with Owen?

480
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,346
It's nothing.

481
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:39,181
Uh, little circles or big circles?

482
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:41,050
Small. You're lying.

483
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:43,052
- Screwdriver.
- I...

484
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:44,186
showed up at his trailer.

485
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:46,088
He was drunk, so I left.

486
00:19:46,123 --> 00:19:47,823
Hose. How drunk?

487
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:49,492
Bad.

488
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:51,217
Slurring, stumbling.

489
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:53,850
He's tried to call, but I'm not ready.

490
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:55,663
Where is he?

491
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:57,598
I'll kill him. Did he hurt you?

492
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:58,833
Are you hurt?!

493
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:01,869
Go fill this with water... cold.

494
00:20:01,904 --> 00:20:03,037
What's going on?

495
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:06,574
There's a stain on the carpet.

496
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,876
You said this was an emergency.

497
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:10,011
There is. There's a stain.

498
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:11,446
I canceled my last two surgeries

499
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,348
and left DeLuca in charge
of my post-ops for this?!

500
00:20:13,382 --> 00:20:14,249
He's out already?

501
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:16,217
The Heller myotomy... that was today.

502
00:20:16,252 --> 00:20:17,118
That got canceled.

503
00:20:17,152 --> 00:20:19,587
Okay, I'll do it myself.

504
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:21,723
Somebody vacuum the stain.

505
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:25,059
Don't look at me.

506
00:20:28,797 --> 00:20:30,698
- Dr. Robbins?
- Huh?

507
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:32,467
I'm so sorry.

508
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:33,635
You are Sofia's mother.

509
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:35,770
I never would've interacted with her

510
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:37,972
if I knew that you would
have a problem with it.

511
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:38,940
What?

512
00:20:38,974 --> 00:20:40,275
What did you do?

513
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:41,709
Uh...

514
00:20:41,744 --> 00:20:44,712
Callie explained to me that
you weren't comfortable

515
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:45,713
with me meeting Sofia.

516
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:48,316
You're not ready, and
I totally understand.

517
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,386
- No, wait, stop.
- Just... No, I never said that.

518
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,987
Well, however you phrased it,

519
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:55,223
it's fine. I just wanted to apologize...

520
00:20:55,257 --> 00:20:57,425
No! The subject has never come up.

521
00:20:57,459 --> 00:21:00,595
She was lying.

522
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,902
Callie lied to me? About you?

523
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:10,638
It sure seems like that.

524
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,200
So, DeLuca probably
just got busy, right?

525
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:20,259
I mean, he's an intern.

526
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:21,926
He's probably just been
running around all day.

527
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:24,465
He just forgot to tell me
his surgery was canceled.

528
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,349
- You sure that thing works?
- It's brand-new!

529
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,253
Just because you never took it

530
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:28,505
out of the box doesn't mean it works.

531
00:21:28,568 --> 00:21:29,935
How long has it been
sitting in the closet?

532
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:31,269
Are we facing this the right way?

533
00:21:31,304 --> 00:21:32,671
The steam is facing the carpet.

534
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:33,572
How many other ways are there?

535
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:35,507
It's been like this lately, you know?

536
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,676
It's been hard for us to get
our schedules to match up.

537
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,294
It's funny.

538
00:21:38,436 --> 00:21:39,903
It was easier for us to get together

539
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:40,971
before we went public than now.

540
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:43,540
So funny.

541
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,439
What?

542
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,508
Why are you all exchanging looks
and not exchanging words?

543
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,310
He's been a little standoffish...

544
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,411
and hard to reach,

545
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:57,715
and not entirely up-front
about everything he's doing.

546
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,150
A-A little, I guess.
What are you saying?

547
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,186
He's giving you the brush-off.

548
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,990
Uh, no. No, he's not giving me anything.

549
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,024
That's the problem.

550
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,827
Gimme that!

551
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,895
You think he's dumping me?!

552
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,564
That's ridiculous!

553
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,032
Unless it isn't.

554
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:20,070
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.

555
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,106
No one brushes me off. I brush.

556
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,607
I'm the brusher.

557
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,376
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This is a bad idea.

558
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,877
Mer, you want to jump in here?

559
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,214
This stain is not coming out.

560
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,790
Hey, whatever's going on
between you and Penny,

561
00:22:39,824 --> 00:22:40,958
- leave me out of it.
- Okay.

562
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,226
She does not waste time.

563
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,928
Um, look I said a thing...

564
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,363
I know! I know what you said.

565
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:49,133
So, listen, I mean, we've never
even discussed Penny meeting Sofia,

566
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,701
which I'm fine with, by the way,

567
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:52,436
but then you go and
throw me under the bus?

568
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,605
I know, I know, I know.
I wasn't thinking.

569
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,041
I-I was just... I blurted
it out, and it was so dumb.

570
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,910
Great, so if you have a
problem with your girlfriend,

571
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:01,045
figure it out.

572
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,414
Don't put me in the middle
of it because I'm... I'm...

573
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,683
I'm done being stuck in
the middle of things.

574
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:15,693
Is that Amelia, or...

575
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,829
Look, I promise I gave her
your message, Dr. Hunt.

576
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:21,565
I-I promise. It's just, this is my mom.

577
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,599
Okay.

578
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:24,802
What'd you do?

579
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,303
Excuse me?

580
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,238
Look, I know that look.

581
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,574
I get that look whenever
I piss off Miranda.

582
00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:33,110
She ignores my messages, too,
and we live in the same house.

583
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,647
I think this is a
little worse than that.

584
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,950
I, uh, I bought Tuck a pocket knife.

585
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:42,786
He liked camping, wanted to whittle.

586
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,154
And the thing was beautiful.

587
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,823
It was wooden handle, steel blade.

588
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,191
It was really nice,

589
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:50,361
but she
didn't see it that way.

590
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,363
What I saw as a survival tool

591
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,265
she saw as an inappropriately
dangerous weapon.

592
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,205
Huh. And she forgave you?

593
00:23:57,307 --> 00:23:59,241
Yeah, eventually, but, uh, you know,

594
00:23:59,276 --> 00:24:00,943
still comes up from time to time,

595
00:24:00,977 --> 00:24:02,278
but, you know, it faded.

596
00:24:02,312 --> 00:24:03,779
Well, I thought this was gonna fade,

597
00:24:03,813 --> 00:24:05,447
but hasn't yet.

598
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:08,684
I mean, it took some apologizing.

599
00:24:08,718 --> 00:24:12,755
A lot of apologizing. Yeah.

600
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:15,157
I just I told her I would
never intentionally

601
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:16,492
do anything to hurt him.

602
00:24:16,526 --> 00:24:17,993
Or her.

603
00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:19,795
You know, and...

604
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:23,332
she knows that because
she knows me, but, um...

605
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:25,701
sometimes you...

606
00:24:25,735 --> 00:24:27,736
you just have to say it.

607
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:34,977
So, I freak her out by
telling her I love her,

608
00:24:35,011 --> 00:24:36,812
and she lies to my face.

609
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:37,880
Who does that?

610
00:24:37,914 --> 00:24:39,448
She didn't say it back?

611
00:24:39,482 --> 00:24:40,216
Not even close.

612
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,850
Ugh. I did that.

613
00:24:41,885 --> 00:24:43,852
To Alex.

614
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,218
She'll say it back. Right?

615
00:24:46,512 --> 00:24:47,957
I mean, you said it back.

616
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:48,724
Yeah!

617
00:24:48,758 --> 00:24:50,025
A-A few...

618
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,327
years later.

619
00:24:51,361 --> 00:24:52,895
A few years?

620
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:56,298
I can't live like this for a few years.

621
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:57,499
Well...

622
00:24:57,534 --> 00:24:58,634
You don't really have a choice.

623
00:24:58,668 --> 00:25:00,903
When you date an attending,
they have all the power.

624
00:25:00,937 --> 00:25:03,172
You're an intern at home.
You're an intern at work.

625
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:05,241
- There's no way around it.
- No one asked you.

626
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:07,009
And she's a resident.

627
00:25:07,043 --> 00:25:08,310
DeLuca...

628
00:25:08,345 --> 00:25:09,578
a word?

629
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:10,846
Yeah, of course.

630
00:25:15,218 --> 00:25:16,385
He has a point, though.

631
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:18,254
Pierce definitely has all the power.

632
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:21,023
I have to talk to Callie.

633
00:25:22,726 --> 00:25:24,660
You're avoiding me.

634
00:25:24,694 --> 00:25:26,829
What? No, I haven't.

635
00:25:26,863 --> 00:25:28,864
I've called. You haven't answered.

636
00:25:28,898 --> 00:25:30,599
- Just been a really busy day.
- Sure.

637
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:33,235
In a marathon surgery that got canceled.

638
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,903
Um...

639
00:25:34,938 --> 00:25:37,506
What's really going on here?

640
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,941
Uh...

641
00:25:38,975 --> 00:25:41,110
Okay, look, I'm very busy.

642
00:25:41,144 --> 00:25:43,545
I have many, many things on my plate.

643
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,447
I-I just... I don't have time

644
00:25:45,482 --> 00:25:48,050
or patience to play
childish guessing games.

645
00:25:48,084 --> 00:25:50,753
Do you want to be with me or not?

646
00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:56,592
There's my answer.

647
00:25:57,427 --> 00:25:58,894
Look, it's... it's not like...

648
00:25:58,928 --> 00:26:02,097
You know, you're the one who
wanted this out in the open,

649
00:26:02,132 --> 00:26:04,533
and now that we've done that
for, what, like five minutes,

650
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:06,568
you can't handle it?!

651
00:26:06,603 --> 00:26:07,870
I'm sorry.

652
00:26:07,904 --> 00:26:09,738
You can leave now.

653
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:21,617
Mer, that closet's cleaned already.

654
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:23,385
Well, we're gonna use the top shelf

655
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,120
for beach towels, towels, and rags.

656
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:26,922
The middle shelf will be for sheets,

657
00:26:26,956 --> 00:26:28,891
and the bottom shelf
will be for the children

658
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:30,392
in case they need to reach it.

659
00:26:30,427 --> 00:26:31,827
Okay. Sure.

660
00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:36,765
I counted 19 mini-shampoos
and 11 conditioners.

661
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,968
- Trash or...
- I'll take 'em.

662
00:26:40,003 --> 00:26:41,236
What?

663
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:43,138
Works the same as shampoo
in a big bottle.

664
00:26:52,615 --> 00:26:54,249
Mer, what is it?

665
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:58,153
It's his stupid, stupid blanket.

666
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,324
We're done cleaning.

667
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:13,701
- Run me through what happened.
- She coded.

668
00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:15,236
It was a massive pulmonary embolism.

669
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,071
They're doing a cath
embolectomy right now.

670
00:27:17,105 --> 00:27:18,105
This is my fault.

671
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,733
I reduced both of her
hips in the trauma room.

672
00:27:20,758 --> 00:27:21,725
I should've waited.

673
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,437
It's been problem after
problem ever since.

674
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:25,615
This is a known complication
of femur fractures.

675
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,140
- You know that.
- I shouldn't have pushed.

676
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:29,442
- If I had just...
- Torres, Torres, stop.

677
00:27:29,477 --> 00:27:31,411
You did what you had to do.
You made a call.

678
00:27:31,445 --> 00:27:33,213
- The wrong one, apparently.
- A bold one.

679
00:27:33,247 --> 00:27:35,215
We don't know that it caused this.

680
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:36,116
I know you feel responsible,

681
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,984
but there's no place for that right now.

682
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:40,287
I need to deal with this clot
before she arrests again.

683
00:27:42,089 --> 00:27:43,356
Thank you.

684
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:47,160
Hey.

685
00:27:47,195 --> 00:27:50,163
Um, I just had the most
unexpected conversation

686
00:27:50,198 --> 00:27:51,097
with your mother.

687
00:27:51,132 --> 00:27:53,166
Damn it, I told her not to say anything.

688
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:55,235
- Just...
- No, no, no, no, it was fine.

689
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:56,837
Um, it was really nice, actually.

690
00:27:56,871 --> 00:27:59,272
Maybe we could find a time to talk,

691
00:27:59,307 --> 00:28:01,875
sometime soon, just the two of us?

692
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:06,446
I'd like that.

693
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,081
Great.

694
00:28:15,323 --> 00:28:17,357
Oh, God, she's dead, isn't she?

695
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:19,659
Ashley's okay.

696
00:28:19,694 --> 00:28:21,328
She suffered a serious complication,

697
00:28:21,362 --> 00:28:23,163
but we were able to control it in time,

698
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:26,099
and she should make a full recovery.

699
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,605
- Whoa, uh...
- I'm sorry.

700
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:32,806
I-I-I didn't hurt you, did I?

701
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,975
No. It's fine. I'm fine.

702
00:28:36,377 --> 00:28:38,278
- S-She'll be awake soon?
- Yeah.

703
00:28:38,312 --> 00:28:39,813
We'll send someone to come and get you.

704
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:41,181
See you.

705
00:28:41,215 --> 00:28:43,350
- You okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

706
00:28:44,485 --> 00:28:46,152
She's at Meredith Grey's house.

707
00:28:46,187 --> 00:28:47,153
She is?

708
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:50,290
She asked me to send
over some cases files,

709
00:28:50,332 --> 00:28:53,081
and so that is where
she will be in case,

710
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,607
you know, you wanted
to make a bold move.

711
00:29:02,882 --> 00:29:04,583
Here you go... Sofia's chart.

712
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,451
- All clear.
- Thank you.

713
00:29:06,486 --> 00:29:08,111
And don't worry. I didn't
discharge her myself.

714
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:09,855
I had Bailey do it.

715
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:11,857
The Chief says she's
good, she must be good.

716
00:29:11,891 --> 00:29:14,293
Look, Penny, I'm sorry. I
should not have lied to you.

717
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:15,427
If we are not in the same place,

718
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:18,664
if you aren't ready to be
where I am, that is fine.

719
00:29:18,698 --> 00:29:21,200
You can tell me, and I will listen.

720
00:29:21,234 --> 00:29:23,866
If you aren't ready for
me to meet Sofia, great.

721
00:29:24,015 --> 00:29:25,048
That is your decision.

722
00:29:25,082 --> 00:29:27,617
But making me feel like
crap about trying to help,

723
00:29:27,652 --> 00:29:31,288
lying to me... that is not okay.

724
00:29:35,593 --> 00:29:39,095
So, uh, Amelia went
to go pick up the kids.

725
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,330
Should be back soon.

726
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:42,132
Whoa.

727
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:43,133
You made a fire.

728
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:46,636
I mean, it's 70 degrees
outside, but that's cool.

729
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:54,611
This was Derek's blanket.

730
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:56,580
I always hated the stupid thing.

731
00:29:56,614 --> 00:29:57,614
It's...

732
00:29:57,648 --> 00:29:59,316
It's not soft. It's not warm.

733
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,451
It's not a great color.

734
00:30:01,485 --> 00:30:04,321
He had it in the trailer.
He brought it here.

735
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:06,790
Made it to the dream house with us.

736
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,230
He made a bed in front of
this fireplace for us once.

737
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:22,305
And now he's gone.

738
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,808
And I still have the damn thing.

739
00:30:27,178 --> 00:30:30,881
I freaked out this morning.

740
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:32,015
I heard.

741
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:34,384
You okay?

742
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:35,185
So...

743
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:37,621
you brought the guy here, and...

744
00:30:37,655 --> 00:30:39,322
it was terrible.

745
00:30:41,993 --> 00:30:44,194
It wasn't terrible?

746
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:48,198
So, why did you freak out?

747
00:30:48,232 --> 00:30:50,800
That's the problem. It
was kind of incredible.

748
00:30:52,737 --> 00:30:55,338
He was going to leave.

749
00:30:55,373 --> 00:30:57,540
And then we fell asleep.

750
00:30:57,575 --> 00:31:01,344
And then when we woke up...

751
00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:02,412
I...

752
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:06,616
He was just there, and I just...

753
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:12,389
Everyone said I was ready.

754
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:14,257
You said I would be okay,

755
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:18,228
so I thought I should just
do it and get it over with.

756
00:31:18,262 --> 00:31:20,530
But I-I wasn't ready for it...

757
00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:25,502
...to be...

758
00:31:37,982 --> 00:31:39,282
You warm enough?

759
00:31:39,317 --> 00:31:42,185
Yeah, I'm fine.

760
00:31:49,654 --> 00:31:52,847
Remember, guys, Mama made
the house really clean,

761
00:31:52,872 --> 00:31:54,706
and we're gonna keep it that way, okay?

762
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,279
Oh, someone's here.

763
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,387
Hey.

764
00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:02,423
Uh, okay, Zo,

765
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,759
you take your brother
inside and wash your hands.

766
00:32:04,794 --> 00:32:07,929
Okay. Come on, Bailey. Let's go.

767
00:32:10,332 --> 00:32:12,066
Hey.

768
00:32:14,303 --> 00:32:16,404
I just wanted to see you.

769
00:32:16,438 --> 00:32:21,476
So... I could apologize,
you know, face-to-face.

770
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,845
About the other night, I am sorry.

771
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:26,815
It... I was thoughtless.

772
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:29,818
And I don't know why I

773
00:32:32,154 --> 00:32:34,522
I don't have an excuse.

774
00:32:34,557 --> 00:32:38,359
Amelia, Riggs said some
things to me, and it just...

775
00:32:38,394 --> 00:32:41,262
And..

776
00:32:41,297 --> 00:32:43,431
And I'm really sorry.

777
00:32:43,465 --> 00:32:46,334
I know.

778
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:47,735
And you...

779
00:32:50,472 --> 00:32:51,840
Listen...

780
00:32:51,874 --> 00:32:55,143
I just got sober again.

781
00:32:55,177 --> 00:32:57,445
So, to find myself in that position...

782
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:59,514
And it was unfair of
me to put you there.

783
00:32:59,548 --> 00:33:03,685
I know that, and... it
will not happen again.

784
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:06,387
No. I know it won't.

785
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:08,623
I promise.

786
00:33:08,657 --> 00:33:12,493
I appreciate that.

787
00:33:12,528 --> 00:33:14,395
But I can't count on it.

788
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:18,299
Right now, I have to count on myself.

789
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:21,402
It's not your fault. You're just...

790
00:33:21,437 --> 00:33:23,304
not in this with me.

791
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:30,545
So I can't do this with
you, not right now, and...

792
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:32,313
maybe not at all.

793
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:35,550
Amelia, you know me. I would never...

794
00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:38,019
I know that right now
I'd like you to leave.

795
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,323
Okay.

796
00:33:57,306 --> 00:33:59,607
Oh, your numbers look great.

797
00:33:59,642 --> 00:34:02,377
Thanks.

798
00:34:02,411 --> 00:34:04,846
They, uh, said, you're, uh...

799
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,115
you're awake.

800
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:09,017
Hi.

801
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:11,286
Um...

802
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,712
I think he might want to come in.

803
00:34:12,798 --> 00:34:13,765
You all right with that?

804
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:14,966
Yeah.

805
00:34:18,938 --> 00:34:21,172
Ash, I, uh...

806
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:23,775
I don't know what to say.

807
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:25,076
Uh...

808
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,177
They said...

809
00:34:26,212 --> 00:34:28,413
I'll be okay.

810
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:31,549
I-I-I'm so glad.

811
00:34:37,223 --> 00:34:42,193
Listen, Chris, I've been to
the mountaintop, and it's...

812
00:34:42,228 --> 00:34:44,529
exhilarating.

813
00:34:44,563 --> 00:34:46,698
- But I...
- But...

814
00:34:46,732 --> 00:34:50,001
you don't ever want to
see me again, do you?

815
00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:53,004
No one needs to climb Everest twice.

816
00:35:01,247 --> 00:35:04,015
Oh, hey. Uh, Sofia's more than okay...

817
00:35:05,317 --> 00:35:07,619
...thanks to some astronaut stickers

818
00:35:07,653 --> 00:35:09,220
and some strawberry jello.

819
00:35:09,255 --> 00:35:10,054
Thank you.

820
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:11,022
When did you know that Little Tuck

821
00:35:11,056 --> 00:35:12,190
was ready to meet Ben?

822
00:35:12,224 --> 00:35:14,359
Oh. Um...

823
00:35:14,393 --> 00:35:18,229
Well, uh, Tuck was too young
to tie his own shoes,

824
00:35:18,264 --> 00:35:20,198
so I wasn't gonna get
any answers from him.

825
00:35:20,232 --> 00:35:24,736
What I cared about was, was I ready?

826
00:35:26,505 --> 00:35:28,239
Hmm?

827
00:35:28,274 --> 00:35:30,642
See, I'm ready. I-I was
ready the day I met her,

828
00:35:30,676 --> 00:35:32,176
but I'm always ready too early.

829
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:33,711
I got married too early.

830
00:35:33,746 --> 00:35:35,680
I

831
00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:38,149
It was one thing when it
was about me, but now...

832
00:35:38,183 --> 00:35:40,485
You know...

833
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:43,254
Say... Okay, when you see Sofia

834
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:44,756
kick a ball across the room

835
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,425
and you start to daydream
about 20 years from now

836
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:49,527
when Sofia scores the winning goal

837
00:35:49,562 --> 00:35:51,329
at the Women's World Cup Final

838
00:35:51,363 --> 00:35:55,033
and the whole stadium
is chanting her name...

839
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:57,368
"Torres! Torres!"

840
00:35:57,403 --> 00:35:58,469
And it's all in slow motion

841
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:01,039
and you're up in the stands
screaming and crying.

842
00:36:01,073 --> 00:36:03,207
Yes, yes. You do that, too?

843
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:08,212
So... the question is,
who do you want...

844
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:12,016
screaming and cheering beside you?

845
00:36:18,257 --> 00:36:20,592
This looks cozy. What are we doing?

846
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:22,961
Enjoying the clean, clean house.

847
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:25,129
Look at your crumbs.

848
00:36:25,164 --> 00:36:26,297
How's DeLuca?

849
00:36:26,332 --> 00:36:27,732
He's a...

850
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:29,434
a non-issue now.

851
00:36:29,468 --> 00:36:32,070
How's Hunt?

852
00:36:33,806 --> 00:36:36,107
Also a non-issue.

853
00:36:38,277 --> 00:36:39,310
What am I eating?

854
00:36:39,345 --> 00:36:42,213
I'm gonna need something way
less healthy than this.

855
00:36:42,247 --> 00:36:43,147
- Pizza's coming.
- Mm.

856
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,984
Mm.

857
00:36:47,186 --> 00:36:48,419
You're not pizza.

858
00:36:48,454 --> 00:36:50,888
Uh, no, I'm not. I'm...

859
00:36:50,923 --> 00:36:51,856
Is Meredith home? I'm Will.

860
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,458
I know who you are.
Yeah, you should leave.

861
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:55,126
Look, I've been worried
about her all day.

862
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,394
- She...
- No, really, go.

863
00:36:56,428 --> 00:36:57,428
It's okay.

864
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:00,798
Hi.

865
00:37:07,172 --> 00:37:09,073
Who's that?

866
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:11,015
That's the doctor who fixed my head!

867
00:37:11,117 --> 00:37:14,686
Yes, she is, and she is
a very special doctor.

868
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,687
You remember her name?

869
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:18,890
Penny. Her name is Penny.

870
00:37:18,924 --> 00:37:20,158
Hi, Penny!

871
00:37:20,192 --> 00:37:22,527
Hi, Sofia. How's your head?

872
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:23,862
Good!

873
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:24,796
We decided that stitches

874
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,931
could only be made
better with ice cream.

875
00:37:26,966 --> 00:37:28,767
And I thought maybe...

876
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:30,702
you might want to come with us?

877
00:37:34,874 --> 00:37:37,776
We are in the same place. I'm
in the same place as you.

878
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:40,044
I've been there a while. I just...

879
00:37:42,047 --> 00:37:44,749
I would like for you to
come get ice cream with us.

880
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:47,252
Very much.

881
00:37:47,286 --> 00:37:49,954
And you can say no.

882
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:51,122
I would understand that.

883
00:37:51,157 --> 00:37:53,191
I'm not saying no.

884
00:37:53,225 --> 00:37:55,960
Then what are you saying?

885
00:37:58,082 --> 00:37:58,964
Thank you.

886
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:03,268
All right. I think we're going.
You ready?

887
00:38:03,302 --> 00:38:05,103
All right, let's go.

888
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:25,557
Hey, Jackson, your mother
and I are headed to dinner.

889
00:38:25,591 --> 00:38:26,458
Care to join?

890
00:38:26,492 --> 00:38:29,160
You know what? I can't. Thanks, though.

891
00:38:29,195 --> 00:38:30,462
Ma, can I talk to you for a second?

892
00:38:30,496 --> 00:38:33,398
Okay.

893
00:38:35,768 --> 00:38:38,603
I told you not to talk to April, right?

894
00:38:38,637 --> 00:38:39,971
I know.

895
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:41,573
Yet you did anyway.

896
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:43,174
I know that, too.

897
00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:47,011
You know, as hard as it is
for me to say this to you...

898
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:49,113
thank you.

899
00:38:49,148 --> 00:38:50,782
It seems like it was...

900
00:38:50,816 --> 00:38:52,150
a good thing.

901
00:38:52,184 --> 00:38:53,017
Like you were right.

902
00:38:53,052 --> 00:38:54,786
Yes, I was.

903
00:38:56,155 --> 00:38:58,857
I got everything we need.

904
00:38:58,891 --> 00:39:00,492
"Need"? Wha-

905
00:39:00,526 --> 00:39:01,993
What she knew, when she knew it,

906
00:39:02,027 --> 00:39:03,595
whom she spoke to, and when.

907
00:39:03,629 --> 00:39:06,097
I needed to confirm that
she withheld information

908
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:09,033
from you when she was signing
those divorce papers...

909
00:39:09,068 --> 00:39:11,836
that she legally committed
fraud, and she did.

910
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:13,304
And now...

911
00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:16,040
we can go after her.

912
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:20,345
Don't stop. Don't hesitate.

913
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:22,714
You can't be scared of what's next.

914
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:32,724
I'm so sorry if I... if I
did something to hurt you.

915
00:39:32,758 --> 00:39:33,858
- I...
- It's not...

916
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:35,827
It's not you.

917
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:37,695
I mean, it is you, but it's...

918
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,964
not because you're you. It's...

919
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:43,334
I'm...

920
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:46,404
Do not let fear get in your way.

921
00:39:46,438 --> 00:39:48,139
I lost my husband...

922
00:39:48,173 --> 00:39:49,707
two years ago,

923
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:53,811
and you are the first person
that I've been with since.

924
00:39:55,848 --> 00:39:57,382
And this would be so much easier

925
00:39:57,416 --> 00:40:00,385
if last night were awful or something.

926
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:02,253
I just...

927
00:40:02,288 --> 00:40:05,423
have a lot of stuff.

928
00:40:05,457 --> 00:40:06,958
It's a lot.

929
00:40:09,295 --> 00:40:12,230
And you're great.

930
00:40:12,264 --> 00:40:15,199
And last night was great.

931
00:40:15,234 --> 00:40:17,068
Yeah, I thought so too.

932
00:40:17,102 --> 00:40:20,338
But there's a "but."

933
00:40:20,372 --> 00:40:22,674
Yeah.

934
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,945
You're not ready.

935
00:40:26,979 --> 00:40:28,613
I guess I'm not.

936
00:40:28,647 --> 00:40:30,448
I want to be.

937
00:40:30,482 --> 00:40:33,184
Okay, then.

938
00:40:33,218 --> 00:40:35,687
I'll...

939
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:38,790
I'll back off.

940
00:40:38,824 --> 00:40:42,060
For a little while.

941
00:40:42,094 --> 00:40:45,797
But so you're prepared...

942
00:40:45,831 --> 00:40:48,600
I'm gonna call you again.

943
00:40:48,634 --> 00:40:50,635
And if you ignore me...

944
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:52,203
I'm gonna show up again

945
00:40:52,237 --> 00:40:55,473
and we'll go back to
sitting in that car,

946
00:40:55,507 --> 00:40:57,208
talking...

947
00:40:57,242 --> 00:40:59,544
and laughing.

948
00:40:59,578 --> 00:41:01,913
And I'll be waiting...

949
00:41:01,947 --> 00:41:05,483
until you're ready because...

950
00:41:05,517 --> 00:41:08,720
I'm pretty sure you're
worth waiting for.

951
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:13,591
Good night.

952
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:25,570
That's why we don't operate alone.

953
00:41:25,604 --> 00:41:28,473
There are attendings and
nurses and interns.

954
00:41:28,507 --> 00:41:30,942
Those O.R.s are full of people.

955
00:41:30,976 --> 00:41:33,511
I'm fine.

956
00:41:33,545 --> 00:41:35,580
- Are you sure?
- Is he gone?

957
00:41:35,614 --> 00:41:39,250
Yes, he's gone. Yes, I am sure.

958
00:41:39,284 --> 00:41:41,219
I am completely and utterly fine.

959
00:41:43,322 --> 00:41:47,191
I'm gonna go check on the pizzas.

960
00:41:47,226 --> 00:41:50,194
Laundry's done. Dishes are done.

961
00:41:50,229 --> 00:41:52,363
And I made a lunch for Zola tomorrow.

962
00:41:52,398 --> 00:41:53,620
Thanks.

963
00:41:53,746 --> 00:41:55,313
And I'm gonna go.

964
00:41:55,348 --> 00:41:57,382
So, in the cases where someone
actually does get hurt...

965
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:59,884
Well, you can stay in
your room if you want.

966
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:02,454
It's clean.

967
00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:12,564
Nobody has to go through it alone.

968
00:42:16,672 --> 00:42:19,781

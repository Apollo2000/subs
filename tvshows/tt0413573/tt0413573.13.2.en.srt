- She's your buffer?

488
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,280
No, Maggie, you are not tagged in.

489
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:44,634
I'm tagging her in.

490
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:46,129
That kind of defeats the point
of all of this.

491
00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:47,409
I didn't agree to all of this.

492
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:48,465
No, tag me in. It's fine.

493
00:18:48,498 --> 00:18:50,001
You're starting a thing here.

494
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:51,504
No, it's okay. All good.

495
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:53,832
And you're not even giving it a chance.

496
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:55,186
Guys, I'll tag myself in.

497
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,369
You obviously need to talk about this.

498
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,936
And I am right behind you.

499
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,985
- No, you don't have to.
- I don't mind.

Jackson: You're still crying?

501
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:06,464
Of course I'm still crying.

502
00:19:06,498 --> 00:19:07,553
April, come on, okay?

503
00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:10,133
I'm gonna bring her by every
single day at the hospital.

504
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:11,489
We already talked about it.

505
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:13,921
As soon as you get home,
we'll fly your mom back out,

506
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,456
get her to stay out here
for a couple months.

507
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,537
My mom already came
for as long as she could, okay?

508
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,104
I can't ask her to come back out.

509
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:21,057
She's... She's got work.

510
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,465
Well, get a baby nurse

511
00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:23,969
who can stay and live with you, then.

512
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:25,361
I can't afford that.

513

I'm loaded. I can.

514
00:19:27,137 --> 00:19:28,640
Well, I'm not.

515
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,040
And we're not married.

516

Yes, I know.

517

You can't fix this, okay?

518
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:37,664
I have to figure this out.
I am a single mom.

519
00:19:37,697 --> 00:19:41,217
April, I'm her father. I'm right here.

and sleeping and happy,

521
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,396

522

You don't need to, like,
check in on me, okay?

523
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:52,115
Or call unless Harriet needs me, okay?

524
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:53,557
So I'm just supposed to
let you cry, then?

525
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,016
Yes!

If you don't get in there,

533
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:12,996
Amelia's gonna make me talk to him,

534
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:14,243
and we're gonna fight about it.

535

Owen gives a great tour.

Yeah, I helped him move in.

We painted the bedroom since then, so...

- Okay. Nathan, you want to...
- Hm.

544
00:20:32,335 --> 00:20:33,604
Oh, actually, I need to talk to Dr. Riggs

545
00:20:33,637 --> 00:20:35,523

Great. So it's just us, then.

Let's go. Come on, let's go.

Who's Mrs... Peterkin?

There is no Mrs. Peterkin.

- Maggie is going to ask you out.

Oh, so...

Maggie wants me?

555
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,387
She wants to date you.

556
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,396
And you are going to be nice and say no.

Oh, so she doesn't know that
you're madly in love with me.

I am not madly in love with you.

You're close. You will be.

560
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:05,587
I am close to hating you.

561

Really? Oh, then we should
just end this right now.

You are going to be very nice,
but you are going to say no.

Yeah. I don't know why I came.

Alex is in a really bad place.

Maybe you could talk to him.

Why are you telling me this?

581

I'm telling you this

582
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:56,125
because you said you showed up in court.

Okay, so then talk to him.

- Maggie: Hey.

977
00:40:06,462 --> 00:40:08,145
What are we drinking?

978
00:40:13,854 --> 00:40:15,388
Slow down.

979
00:40:15,422 --> 00:40:17,756
My God, that was humiliating.

980
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,349
It was worse than being dumped
by DeLuca.

981
00:40:20,382 --> 00:40:21,948
And now he knows how much I like him.

982
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:23,516
Why am I crying?

983
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,429
At some guy who said no?

984
00:40:26,462 --> 00:40:28,381
- [Sighs]
- Who said what?

985
00:40:28,414 --> 00:40:30,269
You live here now,
so you're gonna hear things.

986
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,029
[Clears throat] It's Riggs.

987
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,054
I asked him out.

988
00:40:33,086 --> 00:40:34,461
And he said no.

989
00:40:34,494 --> 00:40:36,221
So fast

990
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:38,236
You know what? Forget him.

991
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:40,477
It's really time to move on.

992
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,629
Okay.

993
00:40:41,662 --> 00:40:43,069
Look on the bright side.

994
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:46,621
Yeah, he did say
he wasn't dating right now.

995
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:48,589
<i>And even when you really screw up...</i>

996
00:40:48,622 --> 00:40:49,949
I'll give it some time.

997
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:53,313
<i>...family is always there,
always on call.</i>

998
00:40:53,347 --> 00:40:54,959
<i>Womb to tomb.</i>

999
00:40:54,993 --> 00:40:56,353
<i>Ride or die.</i>

1000
00:40:56,407 --> 00:41:02,859

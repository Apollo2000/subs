1
00:00:02,853 --> 00:00:05,555
For surgeons,
every day is game day.

2
00:00:15,132 --> 00:00:17,167
I'm gonna have to sneak you out.

3
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:20,003
I feel so dirty.

4
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:21,571
Dirty, dirty secret.

5
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,306
I'm just not ready
for my nieces and nephew

6
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:26,076
- to see you.
- You're married, aren't you?

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,111
No single woman
lives in a house like this.

8
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:29,279
What? No!

9
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:31,614
You're kidding, r...

10
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:35,085
- You got jokes.
- Yeah, from time to time.

11
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,786
We've trained. We've practiced.

12
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:38,989
We know the rules.

13
00:00:39,023 --> 00:00:42,592
No, no! 18 max.

14
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,666
Okay, I really miss sex,
and this is not helping.

15
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:52,936
Are you having sex?

16
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,005
Mm, on occasion.

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,840
Are you thinking about it all the time?

18
00:00:56,874 --> 00:00:58,675
I'm thinking about it right now.

19
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:00,310
I'm almost positive this constitutes

20
00:01:00,344 --> 00:01:03,046
a hostile work environment.

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,048
Note taken.

22
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,218
Well, hang in there.

23
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:16,626
Are you thinking about sex all the time

24
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,361
with the noises through the wall?

25
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:20,030
I am not that loud.

26
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:21,698
The walls are thin.

27
00:01:21,732 --> 00:01:24,300
I miss sex. Don't you?

28
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:26,369
My sex drive has become my work drive.

29
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:29,506
Plus, I got this really
excellent back massager.

30
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,709
Clive is nice. You know?
Like, it's more than sex.

31
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:35,169
I think I really like him.
I'm seeing him again tonight.

32
00:01:35,203 --> 00:01:37,491
You're already at two nights in a
row, and you think you like him?

33
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:38,515
Well, my mom was the one

34
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,750
who always told me whether
a guy was a keeper or...

35
00:01:40,785 --> 00:01:41,618
A serial killer.

36
00:01:41,652 --> 00:01:43,753
He's not a serial killer. He's too nice.

37
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:44,854
You know who says that?

38
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:46,723
Neighbors of serial killers.

39
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:48,391
We should meet him.

40
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:50,393
Judging boyfriends is the number-one perk

41
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:53,163
- of having sisters with no sex lives.
- Tonight?

42
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:56,199
Sure. My thing with
Dr. Cerone doesn't go well,

43
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:57,367
I may just stay home

44
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:59,669
and get drunk with my back massager.

45
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,771
I like this idea of a sister panel.

46
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:03,270
So, what? Dinner?

47
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:05,275
No, more casual.

48
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:07,177
- Game night.
- Game night?

49
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,688
And he'll have no idea that the real game

50
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,046
is us judging him.

51
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:11,781
I'll spread the word.

52
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:18,188
Game night at Grey's place. Sweet.

53
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,457
Pretty sure we weren't invited.

54
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:23,760
She's been like this a while.

55
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:27,063
Uh, I had some bad chicken salad
from the cafeteria.

56
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:29,099
- No, you didn't.
- Snitch.

57
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:31,768
I know you don't want it, but we
need to put in an NG tube.

58
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:35,105
- You need the nutrients.
- No, please. I-I hate that thing.

59
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:37,607
It hurts so bad, and I can't sing.

60
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:41,978
I'm sorry, but the anti-nausea
meds aren't working.

61
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:43,613
That's the only option.

62
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,785
I need you to get me some weed.

63
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,552
- Excuse me?
- I think she means marijuana.

64
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,654
Yeah, I know what she meant,
and the answer is no.

65
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:54,457
- But it's legal in Washington.
- When you're 18.

66
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:56,659
I'm talking about
medical marijuana.

67
00:02:56,694 --> 00:02:59,829
- You've been Googling.
- There's an oil. It won't get me high.

68
00:02:59,864 --> 00:03:02,098
All I need is authorization
from the hospital

69
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:04,400
and my primary physician.

70
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:05,987
It eases the pain, nausea.

71
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:08,338
It's been shown to
help patients on chemo.

72
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:09,672
With PTSD.

73
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:12,242
Look, it's not regulated
or approved by the FDA.

74
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,644
- Was this your idea?
- No, it was my grandma's.

75
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,656
- Is he still alive?
- He's not just alive.

76
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,691
He's freaking celebrating
that he's alive!

77
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:30,294
Don't anthropomorphize the mouse.

78
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,529
Okay, well, I am celebrating
that he is alive.

79
00:03:32,563 --> 00:03:34,723
He should've been dead three days ago.
He has no liver!

80
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:37,133
- Why are you screaming at me?
- B-Because this is big.

81
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:38,778
I mean, we injected him with hepatocytes.

82
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,837
He grew mini livers, and they're working,

83
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:42,277
and you are being way too calm.

84
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:44,841
Because it's only a big deal
if Cerone gives us the patent.

85
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,543
And we can't show him the mouse.

86
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:49,179
Because we used his polymer
without his permission?

87
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:51,481
Yeah, and if he sees
how well this is working,

88
00:03:51,515 --> 00:03:53,650
he'll drive the price up
into the millions.

89
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:56,719
Okay, she is really peeing
on my parade today.

90
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:58,321
Cerone is dead.

91
00:03:58,355 --> 00:03:59,722
And the parade is canceled.

92
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:02,225
- He's dead?
- Yeah. He, uh, died last week.

93
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:04,327
That's why they've been stalling.

94
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:05,695
So who's in charge of the patent?

95
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:08,231
His daughter. That's who
you're meeting with today.

96
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:09,709
You couldn't have
led with that, Hellmouth?

97
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:10,877
What do we know about the daughter?

98
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:12,669
Nothing. I can't find anything online,

99
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:14,321
but you look amazing in that dress.

100
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,806
Excuse me?

101
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,242
Nothing. Sorry. Nothing.

102
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:22,812
- Will this affect my hearing?
- Nope.

103
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:27,217
There's just a collection of blood in
your outer ear that needs draining.

104
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,718
I've never heard of coed rugby.

105
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:29,930
How long have you been playing?

106
00:04:29,954 --> 00:04:32,002
Sarah doesn't play. She's the manager.

107
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:33,189
Yeah, you're glad I don't.

108
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:34,917
- I'd crush you, Duran.
- Ha!

109
00:04:34,952 --> 00:04:36,926
Hey, Bachmann.

110
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:39,395
Oh, hey, no throwing
that ball in here, okay?

111
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,698
I, uh, have this heart thing
since I was a kid.

112
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:44,267
So, I was on the sidelines
when a ruck got out of control.

113
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:45,680
I don't need surgery, do I?

114
00:04:45,714 --> 00:04:47,437
Nope, I'm gonna do this right here.

115
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:49,249
I just gave you a field block
to numb your ear.

116
00:04:49,273 --> 00:04:50,506
You shouldn't feel a thing.

117
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,342
Aaah!

118
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,876
You know, I need another hand here.

119
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:56,179
- Uh, DeLuca.
- Coming.

120
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,081
Do you know, are interns invited to

121
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:00,683
this game thing tonight at...
at Dr. Pierce's?

122
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,352
Games? I love games.

123
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,088
Hey, stop throwing the ball in my ER!

124
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:06,589
Here's your ball, Bachmann.

125
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:07,857
Ohh!

126
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:11,261
Heads!

127
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:15,164
Aah!

128
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:16,366
Oh, God.

129
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,767
- What happened?
- Oh, God.

130
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:19,413
- What is it?
- Okay, I need more four-by-fours.

131
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:21,304
I got them.

132
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:22,538
Wah!

133
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:23,706
- Whoa!
- Hey!

134
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:26,678
Aaah!

135
00:05:26,713 --> 00:05:28,945
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

136
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,714
Okay. You okay, DeLuca?

137
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,950
Yep. I'm just gonna...

138
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:35,285
No.

139
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:46,103

140
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:50,128
Wait.
I-I slipped on someone's ear?

141
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,996
Was it attached to their head?

142
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,484
Not at the time.

143
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,121
Okay, no intracranial
bleeding or swelling.

144
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:00,458
Congratulations. It's a grade-3
concussion. What's the treatment?

145
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:05,630
Uh... rest, minimal stimuli,
dim lights, no screens.

146
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:07,699
- Good.
- Cognitive skills still intact.

147
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,635
You are staying in
a patient room tonight.

148
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:13,806
Ugh.

149
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,675
Oh, hey, did Sam see me fall?

150
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,545
Dr. Bello... Did Sam Bello see me fall?

151
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,458
I have to have surgery?
You have to put me out?

152
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,555
For me to reattach the ear, yes.

153
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:33,065
Can it even be reattached?
That guy smooshed it.

154
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,059
That's fine.
Most ears are smooshed, anyway.

155
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,262
And once it's healed up,
you'll barely notice it.

156
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,063
What happened here?

157
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,282
- Hey.
- Hi.

158
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,456
Um, long story.

159
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:43,234
Sarah, this is Dr. Pierce.

160
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,369
She is our chief of cardio.

161
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,672
Sarah tells me she has
ventricular septal defect, so...

162
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,741
- Little hole in your heart.
- Since I was a kid.

163
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:52,210
And she's a little worried
about the anesthesia.

164
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,345
More worried about calling my dad.

165
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,797
He's gonna be so pissed.

166
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:58,008
Well, let's take a look.

167
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,852
Um, okay. I will come check on
you before the surgery, okay?

168
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:02,587
Thanks.

169
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,893
Do you two have a thing?

170
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,728
He's so nice.

171
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,230
A thing? Us?

172
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:14,632
I-I just figured maybe because, you know,

173
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,234
there were a lot of vibes.

174
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:17,602
No, I have a...

175
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:19,871
You have a boyfriend
that's better than that?

176
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:22,573
I would like to see him, please.

177
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,475
Let's go take a look at your heart.

178
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:27,612
I don't understand why you're upset.

179
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:29,363
Because this is my OB department,

180
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:30,959
- which means you work for me and...
- Ooh, Dr. Lackman.

181
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,718
- You paged me?
- Yeah. Yes. Yes.

182
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,754
Dr. DeLuca is asking
for all of my OB records.

183
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,223
She says you're launching
some kind of investigation.

184
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,559
Oh, no, no, not...
not an investigation... a study.

185
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:42,815
- It's a study.
- That's what I said.

186
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,066
Well, I know, but you also called

187
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,631
a seat belt a "strap-on," so,
you know, sometimes, uh...

188
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:49,567
Um, it's a study. It's a
maternal mortality study

189
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:51,769
on cases in the U.S. versus
other developed countries.

190
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,969
- Oh.
- Yeah.

191
00:07:53,003 --> 00:07:54,605
It's for the medical innovation contest.

192
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,141
- Ah.
- Hey, by the way, Sofia keeps asking

193
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,843
if she can have a playdate with Lindsay.

194
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:01,145
Oh, seems like they were just
in the daycare together.

195
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,680
I know. It goes too fast.

196
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,016
Here's my log-in and password.
Use what you need.

197
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,352
- Mm.
- And call me. Let's set up a playdate.

198
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:10,021
Yeah. Definitely. Okay.

199
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:14,455
- You want it? You want it?
- Come on.

200
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:17,662
Okay.
Let's take a look at that leg.

201
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:19,464
Uh, no. No way.

202
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,376
You're the one that chopped
that girl's ear off.

203
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,501
Oh, you mean Sarah,
the girl who lost her ear

204
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:25,770
because you couldn't follow
a simple direction?

205
00:08:25,804 --> 00:08:27,705
I want someone else, a different doctor.

206
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,200
Fine.

207
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:32,721
Schmitt!

208
00:08:32,755 --> 00:08:33,911
There's your someone else.

209
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,347
Uh, pass. I'd like a doctor
who's older than me.

210
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,116
Well, we're a little short
on doctors today

211
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,484
'cause someone threw a ball.

212
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:42,120
So we're just gonna call this
a teaching moment.

213
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,855
For... me or him?

214
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:45,156
Ugh! Does it matter?

215
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,317
All right.

216
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:48,159
Uh, now I need you to get a solid base

217
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:49,827
before you reduce that fracture.

218
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,896
I already lost an ear.
Hate to lose a foot.

219
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,032
- W-What?
- Hold up, Schmitt.

220
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,228
Kepner, can I, uh,
talk to you for a second?

221
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,173
Um, so, I'm gonna take over, and
you can head home for the day.

222
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,398
- What?
- Chief's orders.

223
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:07,245
She's talking to legal, and they
said that you should stand down.

224
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,626
Wait. S... I'm...

225
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,066
I'm getting suspended? Why?

226
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,183
Well, you cut a girl's ear off,
for starters.

227
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:13,325
It's only for the day.

228
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,729
Yeah, because a kid was throwing a ball

229
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:16,354
after I repeatedly told him to stop.

230
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,933
Yes, everybody knows that, and the
security video will affirm that.

231
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:21,717
Okay, what's the problem, then?
The problem is I heard it from Bailey,

232
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:24,262
she heard it from Webber,
and you never reported it?

233
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:25,830
- I...
- An accident in your ER...

234
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:27,498
...resulting in a mangled patient

235
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,435
and an injured surgeon
could mean major lawsuits.

236
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,347
- And there's no incident report?
- No, I was gonna do it later.

237
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,624
You don't mention it to me?
I was working. I...

238
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:35,417
- What is going on, Kepner?
- You know, wh-what's going on

239
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,008
is that somebody broke the rules

240
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,686
and somebody else
is getting punished for it.

241
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,179
That's what's going on.

242
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,784
Okay, see that color there?

243
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,353
That's where your blood
is flowing through your VSD.

244
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,955
Still there.

245
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,924
They found it when I was 8.

246
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,827
But they said having a big surgery

247
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,561
would be riskier than just keeping it.

248
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:57,862
Well, it was back then.

249
00:09:57,896 --> 00:09:59,964
Now I could use a catheter

250
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:01,599
to place a patch on the hole.

251
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:04,802
It's way less invasive,
which means way less risky.

252
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,104
Wait. What?

253
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,972
Just like that? No open-heart surgery?

254
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,509
Nope.

255
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:12,415
Then my dad would let me play rugby?

256
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,046
Well, is your dad anti-rugby?

257
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,881
He's anti-me dying.

258
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:19,984
He made me quit because of my
heart, so I'm team manager.

259
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:21,586
But, I mean, after this,

260
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,654
I could totally get off the sidelines.

261
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,970
Could you fix it while you fix my ear?

262
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:26,801
No, it would have to be
two separate surgeries...

263
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:29,894
your ear first, and then your heart.

264
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:31,574
But I will assist Dr. Avery

265
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:33,736
with the vascular reconnections
on your ear,

266
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:36,000
and I can monitor your heart
while I'm there.

267
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:37,969
Hmm.

268
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:39,226
What?

269
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,807
Even when you say his name,
there's vibes.

270
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,147
Stop it.

271
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:44,809
Please.

272
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,449
You got a minute?

273
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,949
Ha, do I look like I have a minute?

274
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,194
You never look like you have a minute.

275
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:55,463
Then read my face, and I'll come
find you when I'm done here.

276
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:57,088
I want to give
my 12-year-old patient

277
00:10:57,122 --> 00:10:59,524
authorization for medical marijuana.

278
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,963
Karev, have you met
the Grey Sloan Legal Team?

279
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:11,869
So, there's nothing else online

280
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,191
about Cerone's daughter?

281
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:15,973
No, she's an only child. She has
an MD after her name. That's it.

282
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,008
Okay.

283
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,209
- So we smile...
- Mm.

284
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:19,410
...uh, act polite,
- Mm.

285
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:22,880
...kill her with kindness,
and we do not mention the mouse.

286
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,959
Do we really have enough
for the presentation without it?

287
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:27,618
Well, the presentation with it
is definitely too much.

288
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:28,986
Meredith?

289
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:35,193
Look at you all grown up.

290
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,061
Auntie Marie?!

291
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:38,396
"Mer-Mer"!

292
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:41,367
Twist.

293
00:11:47,512 --> 00:11:49,851
I was so sorry to hear about your father.

294
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,010
Oh, thank you.
He was sick for a long time.

295
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,612
It was time.

296
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,586
- And he was ready.
- Hmm.

297
00:11:55,621 --> 00:11:59,852
Ah, you look just the same but prettier.

298
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,787
And the last time I saw you was...

299
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,022
- 8th birthday party.
- Oh, my goodness.

300
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,431
The balloons?

301
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:06,725
The balloons!

302
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,794
She filled the entire bedroom,

303
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,696
floor to ceiling, with balloons.

304
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,364
It was... insane.

305
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,466
You were a disembodied giggle.

306
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,703
Are you really her...

307
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,837
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

308
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:19,972
This is Dr. Jo Wilson.

309
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,707
She's my partner on the project.

310
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,763
This is Marie Cerone.

311
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:24,343
Hi. So, are you really her aunt?

312
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,011
N-Not by blood.

313
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,847
Her mother and I were friends,
best friends.

314
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,382
I watched Meredith grow up.

315
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,318
And then you just sort of
disappeared after...

316
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,853
What... What... What happened?

317
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,889
Ugh. Your mother didn't tell you?

318
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,199
I had to go back to Spain.

319
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:40,092
My father wanted me to run the business.

320
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,894
- Oh.
- Ah!

321
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,862
I just want to squeeze you, my Mer-Mer!

322
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:44,997
Mer-Mer?

323
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,532
You don't go by that anymore?

324
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,293
- Unh.
- Ah!

325
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,938
I really wanted to get in touch
when I heard about Ellis.

326
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:56,161
I wanted to, but...

327
00:12:56,196 --> 00:12:57,336
It's okay.

328
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,887
I have watched you all these years.

329
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,015
She would've been proud of you, Meredith.

330
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,783
She would've been very proud.

331
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,157
Uh, took a spill in the kitchen.

332
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,860
Aw. Okay. Ma'am, let's take a look.

333
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,862
I'm gonna shine
a bright light into your eye.

334
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,239
Oh! You think you're so hard.
I've been carrying us all year!

335
00:13:19,263 --> 00:13:21,043
Why don't you come over here
and say that to my face?

336
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,134
Oh, man, you are so lucky

337
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,135
- I'm on the bed right now.
- I'll be right back.

338
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,446
If you hadn't
tackled me from behind,

339
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,470
I'd still have a season.

340
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,449
You're the reason that
we had to forfeit that game.

341
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,974
I didn't start the stupid thing!

342
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,653
- Okay, okay, knock it off.
- Oh, so you're saying I did?

343
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:31,854
- Back off, man!
- Knock it off!

344
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,579
Whoa!

345
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:34,813
Aah!

346
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,289
Aah. Damn it!

347
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:37,816
Just stay down there for a second.

348
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,908
Aah!

349
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,587
What kind of doctor are you?

350
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,222
Military doctor, and this is my ER.

351
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,434
You guys seem to think that
our rules don't apply to you,

352
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,969
and it's cost me two good surgeons today,

353
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,994
so if one of you so much as makes a sound

354
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,896
before you're discharged from my ER,

355
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,211
I will send you out of here
on a stretcher. Understood?

356
00:13:54,245 --> 00:13:55,431
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

357
00:13:55,465 --> 00:13:57,336
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,406
Oh. I like a man with authority.

359
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,941
Me too.

360
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,688
Ohh.

361
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:06,812
Aah!

362
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,207
God, my leg! Ow!

363
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,284
Oh, it hurts! It hurts!

364
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,319
There's no pulse.

365
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,335
Okay, it's compartment syndrome.

366
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,926
I'm gonna need Betadine and a scalpel.

367
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,448
A scalpel?! What are you gonna do?!

368
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:24,707
I need to release pressure,
or you're gonna lose your leg.

369
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,698
So close your eyes, okay?

370
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,133
Yes, sir.

371
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,843
- Ohh. Wow, dude.
- Nasty!

372
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:40,946
I said close your eyes!

373
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,949
Don't you ever do what you're told?!

374
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,553
Oh, that's him.

375
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,656
Oh, the father of the girl
who lost her ear?

376
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,958
She did not lose an ear.
We're putting it back on.

377
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,903
Look, legal wanted someone
who witnessed the accident

378
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,662
to be with me when I spoke to him,

379
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,563
so no more "losing the ear" talk.

380
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,532
- Uh, Mr. Maurer?
- Finally.

381
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,334
Thank you so much for your patience.

382
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,002
I'm Chief Miranda Bailey.

383
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,515
- This is Dr. Richard Webber.
- I want to see my daughter. Now.

384
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,674
Absolutely.

385
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,009
- Let me just explain what happened.
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,022
Oh, I've heard. She got a
bad bruise at a rugby game,

387
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:16,014
and some incompetent ER doctor
cut her damn ear off.

388
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,983
I want to talk to my daughter.

389
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,985
I'm afraid she's already in surgery.

390
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,365
She's in surgery?

391
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,989
Are you aware Sarah has
a ventricular septal defect

392
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,167
which can cause her complications

393
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,425
under general anesthesia?

394
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,061
Yes, we are aware,
and she's being supervised

395
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,562
by our chief of cardio.

396
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,897
Uh, are you a doctor?

397
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,167
No. Malpractice attorney.

398
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,942
Cardiac status is rock steady.

399
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,711
Wouldn't even know she had a defect.

400
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,379
- Excellent.
- Mm.

401
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,848
So, um, game night, huh?

402
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,152
Oh, yeah, yeah.

403
00:15:51,187 --> 00:15:53,552
- Amelia told you?
- Yeah, should she not have?

404
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,920
Oh, no, no. No, you're w...

405
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,022
You're invited, of course.

406
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:01,059
Clive will be there, so you're
welcome to bring someone.

407
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,261
Cool, yeah. Thanks.

408
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,031
So... are you gonna bring someone?

409
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,967
Yeah, I guess I'll, uh...
Yeah, I'm bringing Priya.

410
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,803
Oh. Didn't realize you were
still seeing each other.

411
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,705
Uh, yeah, a couple more dates.

412
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,108
A little bit difficult
to juggle. She travels a lot.

413
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,243
She was in the Netherlands last week.

414
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,811
Oh. Vacation?

415
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,080
Uh, no, work. The Hague.

416
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,715
Right. Oh, wow.

417
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,984
Wow, just a... a human-rights lawyer.

418
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,158
Clive's a stockbroker.

419
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,627
It's nice to date someone outside
of the hospital, isn't it?

420
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,397
- It is refreshing, actually, yeah.
- Yeah.

421
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,109
Talk to somebody
about something other than

422
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,577
the latest issue
of The Lancet so that's...

423
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,568
Yeah.

424
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,970
Yeah.

425
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,471
Did you read that article

426
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,073
about pre-hospital antibiotics and...

427
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,775
- That was amazing. You read that?
- Yeah.

428
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,310
- Yes, groundbreaking.
- Incredible.

429
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:01,953
Do you need me to go over it
with you one more time?

430
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:05,557
No, no. I understand completely.

431
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,719
It's just...

432
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,998
I want so badly to support you.

433
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,359
The people who are courting me

434
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:16,668
are corporations with money
and none of the art.

435
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,870
I was even willing
to sell to you for less,

436
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,039
but at this point,
your proposal, it's brilliant,

437
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,341
but it's just theory and dreams.

438
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,177
Oh, it'll work. I know it'll work.

439
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,013
You can't know. Not yet.

440
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,291
And I can't sell you my father's patent

441
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,316
just because you're my Mer-Mer.

442
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,851
S-She's not.

443
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:34,853
I'm sorry?

444
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,621
She's not your Mer-Mer anymore.

445
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,658
She's Harper Avery-winning
surgeon Meredith Grey.

446
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,193
With all due respect, Dr. Cerone,

447
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,238
please don't make the mistake
of underestimating her

448
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,163
just because you knew her
when she was a child.

449
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,843
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

450
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,762
It's the last thing I wanted to do.

451
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,473
Helm, get the mouse.

452
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,874
Yes!

453
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,242
Sorry.

454
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,333
What's this about you not
putting in the feeding tube?

455
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,557
Well, we might not have to.

456
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,660
I went and got the signatures. I just
need yours, and we can move forward.

457
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,195
Move forward with what?

458
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,164
The medical marijuana.

459
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,532
E-Excuse me?

460
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,267
I'm authorizing marijuana for Kimmie.

461
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,468
She said it was your idea.

462
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:27,105
To give a 12-year-old marijuana?
Are you out of your mind?!

463
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,740
To relieve her nausea and to keep her

464
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,442
from needing to be
on a... a feeding tube.

465
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,910
She's a child.

466
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,055
There's research that say it's a...

467
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,281
No! I don't care what it says.

468
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,759
You're not gonna turn her
into a drug addict

469
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,117
like her parents.

470
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,252
You're fired.

471
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,354
- I'm what?
- You're fired!

472
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,289
You're off Kimmie's case.

473
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:48,093
I'm finding another doctor
at another hospital.

474
00:18:57,693 --> 00:19:00,242
Wh... Am I gonna die?

475
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:03,092
- Yes. Probably not today, but, yes.
- Dude!

476
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:04,465
There was a buildup of blood

477
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:05,943
between the layers of tissue
and your leg.

478
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:07,234
But I-is that fatal?

479
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:09,036
Well, it could've caused you
to lose the leg.

480
00:19:09,071 --> 00:19:10,438
But I got it in time.

481
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:11,906
Now we just need to make sure

482
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,374
that it doesn't continue to bleed.

483
00:19:13,408 --> 00:19:15,676
It's just that, um,
there's a lot of blood,

484
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,388
and... and I have a term paper
I haven't finished,

485
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:19,280
and... and I have a present
for my girlfriend,

486
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:20,581
and, like... like, you know,

487
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:22,750
it's j-just a sweatshirt s-she likes,

488
00:19:22,784 --> 00:19:23,751
and, like...

489
00:19:23,785 --> 00:19:25,019
My parents!

490
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:27,688
I never,
like, thanked them for, like...

491
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:30,034
like, being my parents, and,
like, I almost died, you know?

492
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:33,094
Okay, Chris, I need you to shut
up so I can keep saving you.

493
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:35,963
Okay. Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry I threw that ball.

494
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:38,432
- We're good.
- Okay.

495
00:19:40,168 --> 00:19:42,970
Patient number 66055. 38 years old.

496
00:19:43,004 --> 00:19:45,739
Emergency C-section due to cord prolapse.

497
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:46,941
Hmm.

498
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:48,979
- Questo è strano.
- English, please.

499
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:51,278
English somewhere else, please.

500
00:19:51,313 --> 00:19:53,380
Oh, your sister's
worried about you, Andrew.

501
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:56,250
It... Well, it's a headache
made worse by noise.

502
00:19:56,284 --> 00:19:57,651
Sorry.

503
00:19:57,686 --> 00:19:58,652
Ugh.

504
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:02,089
Um, I said,
"This is strange." Look.

505
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:04,943
That's our hospital's,
uh, C-section rates?

506
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:07,294
- Uh-huh.
- It was steady until three years ago,

507
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:11,899
when it started trending up,
and... look which doctor

508
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:14,802
does way more of them
than the hospital average.

509
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:18,105
- Huh.
- We should say something.

510
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:19,673
O-Or maybe you could just mention it

511
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,085
during Lindsay and Sofia's playdate.

512
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:22,943
Oh, no, that's not what we're studying.

513
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:24,418
Besides, C-sections don't kill moms.

514
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:26,013
But they are major surgeries,

515
00:20:26,047 --> 00:20:28,315
therefore more dangerous
than vaginal birth.

516
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,783
We should only perform them

517
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:31,696
when the benefits outweigh
other risk factors, just...

518
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,955
Can we just... Can we focus
on the bigger picture?

519
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,802
Fine.

520
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:40,275
_

521
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,596
_

522
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,631
- Ah. That's sexy.
- What does that mean?

523
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,396
I'll tell you if you leave.

524
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,105
Now, I know it looks rough now,

525
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:54,508
but... once the swelling goes down,

526
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:56,777
it'll... it's gonna be hardly noticeable.

527
00:20:56,811 --> 00:20:59,513
It'd be a lot less noticeable
if it'd stayed where it belongs.

528
00:20:59,547 --> 00:21:01,882
Uh, no, that surgery went very well.

529
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,051
When can we schedule my next surgery?

530
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:05,285
Your next surgery?

531
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,888
Dr. Pierce said she could fix my VSD.

532
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:09,990
No doctor in this hospital

533
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:11,992
is gonna lay a hand on you again.

534
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:13,671
And with the money
we're gonna sue them for...

535
00:21:13,695 --> 00:21:15,996
Dad. We're not suing anybody.

536
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:17,998
I don't want to be
on the sidelines anymore.

537
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:19,316
I want to play.

538
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,369
If I'm gonna get hurt, I'd
rather get hurt on the field.

539
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:24,505
Can't you just cheer me on?

540
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,507
Please?

541
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,721
What do you mean they're leaving?
Where is she taking her?

542
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:32,880
I don't know. We need to stop it.

543
00:21:32,914 --> 00:21:34,081
I'll talk to Grandma Peg.

544
00:21:34,115 --> 00:21:35,328
- No. No, you won't.
- No, you won't.

545
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:37,551
CBD oil is not gonna
make Kimmie an addict.

546
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:39,063
Addiction is what makes people addicts.

547
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:40,254
Can you talk to her?

548
00:21:40,288 --> 00:21:41,422
No, Alex, I don't disclose

549
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:43,057
my personal history to patients.

550
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,735
Because people hear
the word "addict," and they...

551
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,260
they make a lot of assumptions.

552
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:48,529
- You're an addict?
- Like that.

553
00:21:48,563 --> 00:21:50,097
She likes you. She trusts you.

554
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:52,232
Just talk to her.

555
00:21:55,036 --> 00:21:56,870
Wow.

556
00:21:57,906 --> 00:22:00,862
- What?
- Well, you've been through the darkness.

557
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:02,943
That's... sexy.

558
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:05,913
Should we check on Andrew?

559
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:07,748
What if the CT missed
a tiny epidural hematoma

560
00:22:07,782 --> 00:22:09,127
and this is his lucid interval

561
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,761
and it's just in there
growing and growing,

562
00:22:10,785 --> 00:22:12,596
and then... bam!
and he's got gravy for brains?

563
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,221
Yeah, I'm familiar with that scenario,

564
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:16,557
and avoiding it is high on my list.

565
00:22:16,591 --> 00:22:19,359
But, yes, you may check on Andrew.

566
00:22:19,394 --> 00:22:20,527
And while you're there,

567
00:22:20,562 --> 00:22:23,697
you might want to tell him
that you are in love with him.

568
00:22:23,731 --> 00:22:26,867
Uh... w-we're bad for each other.

569
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:28,333
Pretending you're
not in love with each other

570
00:22:28,357 --> 00:22:30,137
is what makes you bad for each other.

571
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:33,307
And denying reality to this degree

572
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:34,775
makes you useless to me

573
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:36,810
and, by extension, to this whole project.

574
00:22:42,117 --> 00:22:43,984
Oh, that's sexy, too.

575
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:46,487
I mean, a kid's dying while
you play matchmaker, but...

576
00:22:46,521 --> 00:22:48,222
I found it hot.

577
00:22:48,256 --> 00:22:49,723
You want to...

578
00:22:49,757 --> 00:22:51,558
No! No. No.

579
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:55,229
Denying reality to that degree

580
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:56,663
can make you...

581
00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:03,403
You said the future of science.

582
00:23:03,438 --> 00:23:07,007
I was half-expecting
your mouse to have wings.

583
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,775
Well, he's got better than wings.

584
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,477
He has mini livers.

585
00:23:10,512 --> 00:23:14,181
This mouse had his liver removed
over a week ago.

586
00:23:14,215 --> 00:23:16,116
We injected him with hepatocytes,

587
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:18,752
which took over his liver
function and saved him.

588
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:20,654
He should've been dead three days ago.

589
00:23:20,688 --> 00:23:24,525
I mean, even his energy
and appetite have returned.

590
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,128
You've already used my polymer
even without permission.

591
00:23:28,163 --> 00:23:30,864
Well, you understand
we had to test my theory,

592
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:32,666
so we just re-created the polymer

593
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,402
using your original methodology.

594
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:38,438
My God.

595
00:23:38,473 --> 00:23:40,674
You are your mother's daughter.

596
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,114
- Hi!
- Hi.

597
00:23:47,148 --> 00:23:49,049
You must be Priya. I'm Maggie.

598
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,684
Oh, it is such a pleasure to meet you.

599
00:23:50,718 --> 00:23:52,686
- Oh.
- I understand you're revolutionizing

600
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,022
ventricular assist device technology.

601
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:56,365
So impressive.

602
00:23:56,399 --> 00:23:57,824
Wow! Jackson told you.

603
00:23:57,859 --> 00:23:59,693
And you know what it is.

604
00:23:59,727 --> 00:24:01,295
I represented a Burmese dissident

605
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:05,399
who died after his LVAD failed
during a prison power outage.

606
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:06,660
I needed to learn my way

607
00:24:06,685 --> 00:24:08,235
- around some medicine.
- Yeah.

608
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:11,071
Are any of your friends, like,
ballplayers or accountants?

609
00:24:12,707 --> 00:24:14,007
Trying to keep up here.

610
00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:18,723
This is Clive.

611
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,814
He, um... He's being modest.

612
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:22,816
He actually came up with the algorithm

613
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,419
to predict stock values
based on social-media hashtags.

614
00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:27,187
- Get out of here.
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:24:27,222 --> 00:24:29,156
Hey, well, I have heard
so much about you.

616
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,158
Oh! Yeah. He's joking.

617
00:24:31,192 --> 00:24:34,161
Whatever she told you, it's
probably true. I'm pretty boring.

618
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,530
Do you want me to help you with this?

619
00:24:36,554 --> 00:24:37,875
- Yeah, let's go out here.
- Yeah, sure.

620
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:39,099
- Okay.
- Okay.

621
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:40,701
Hmm. Thank you.

622
00:24:40,735 --> 00:24:41,766
Ah!

623
00:24:41,801 --> 00:24:43,537
So you guys are a thing now. Huh.

624
00:24:43,571 --> 00:24:48,041
Your parents must be thrilled.

625
00:24:48,076 --> 00:24:50,010
- Wait. Who?
- Who's a thing?

626
00:24:50,044 --> 00:24:51,248
No, no, no. She's just...

627
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,280
Oh, I'm just his ex-wife and baby mama.

628
00:24:53,314 --> 00:24:55,526
- Whoa, okay. Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah, never better.

629
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,217
Hey. I'm April. How's it going?

630
00:24:57,252 --> 00:24:58,452
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi.

631
00:24:58,486 --> 00:25:00,254
Hey, April, thanks for coming.

632
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:02,289
Do you want, uh, something to drink?

633
00:25:02,323 --> 00:25:03,890
Oh, no. I brought my own.

634
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:05,959
Ha!

635
00:25:10,064 --> 00:25:11,131
She seems fun.

636
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:13,033
- Ha.
- Yeah.

637
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:17,982
Where are Amelia and Meredith?

638
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,027
That would help us get started.

639
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,795
Yeah, these games
aren't gonna play themselves.

640
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,787
- How long are we gonna wait?
- We can start now.

641
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:23,867
Well, we need teams of two.

642
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:25,267
Why didn't anyone tell me
to bring my own team?

643
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,457
I could just watch.

644
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:28,159
No. Oho! No.

645
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,428
Everyone plays at game night.
That's the rule.

646
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,831
Whoever that is can be your partner.

647
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,133
- Wow.
- Oh.

648
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,897
This looks like a... rager.
Where's Shepherd?

649
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:39,337
Uh, she wasn't with you in the lab?

650
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,372
N-Nope. Th-These are the games?

651
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:43,975
I got to warn you,
I play a mean charades.

652
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,176
Wh-What's this?

653
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:47,378
Drink?

654
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:48,880
Yeah. I'd love one. Thanks.

655
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,348
Mm.

656
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,867
Uh, how's your head?

657
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,202
Do you need anything?

658
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:17,017
We were really young, Sam.

659
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,412
Back then, we were young...

660
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:24,024
and we were stupid, and...

661
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:29,520
we're older now, and we're here together.

662
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:32,924
And you were never just sex to me...

663
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,993
not then, not now.

664
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,539
I just needed to say that.

665
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,366
I-I need to say that...

666
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,067
I love you, too.

667
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,970
Oh.

668
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,946
Hey, Kate!

669
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,914
Thank you. Thank you for the data.

670
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,182
Oh, not a problem.

671
00:26:58,217 --> 00:26:59,951
Sorry I misunderstood your partner.

672
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,262
Oh, God, no, that's okay.
Um, you know what?

673
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,231
We... Uh, we actually have only
just been dating a little bit.

674
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,556
I'm not even actually sure
what you would call...

675
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:07,225
You... Ha ha!

676
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,760
You mean my research partner, huh?

677
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,962
Yep. But I appreciate the update.

678
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,930
Did you get everything you need?

679
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:16,567
Yeah, um, I actually...
I wanted to give this to you.

680
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,472
Grey-Sloan's C-section rates?

681
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:22,586
Yeah.

682
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,542
Th-The rates are climbing, you know,

683
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,310
and t-the procedures look like they're...

684
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:29,113
they're done out of convenience
more than medical necessity,

685
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,949
and you and I both know
that some unnecessary C-sections

686
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,051
cause unnecessary complications.

687
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,988
And, um, it's actually, uh,
broken down by doctor.

688
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,600
I thought you were
working on a global study,

689
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,059
not starting a witch hunt of my OBs.

690
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,395
Kate...

691
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:48,499
you did twice as many
as the next highest doctor.

692
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,969
We're friends. We're...
We're Facebook friends.

693
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,471
And it looks like every single one

694
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,016
of these scheduled C-sections
occurs on a Friday

695
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,317
when you're about to go out of town.

696
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,142
Are you accusing me of something?

697
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,179
No, I just want you to be aware
of it as a friend.

698
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,580
I...

699
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:03,748
Have a good night.

700
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,906
You ready to go to game night?

701
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:17,028
I don't know.

702
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,197
- Ah.
- I have something else in mind.

703
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:20,300
Ooh!

704
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:21,599
Uh, vomiting.

705
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,353
Uh, uh, spewing.

706
00:28:23,387 --> 00:28:25,769
Uh, uh, uh, mouth confetti.

707
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,038
Uh, uh, uh, ceiling, attic.

708
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,398
Uh, "Flowers in the Attic"!

709
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,174
Uh, sky.

710
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,309
Star.

711
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:32,426
Puke star.

712
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,685
Rain.

713
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:36,180
- "Singing in the Rain"!
- Yes!

714
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,348
Yes!

715
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,317
Beat that, suckers!

716
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,451
- Hey.
- Yes.

717
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:41,659
Puke star was good.

718
00:28:41,694 --> 00:28:42,765
- All right.
- Okay. Uh...

719
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,855
Ah! Okay.

720
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:44,939
- Mm.
- Yeah. Ah.

721
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,123
Oh, yeah. Okay, go.

722
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:48,059
Okay. Um...

723
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,961
Kneel, take a knee.

724
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,588
Uh, proposing, proposal.

725
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,798
- Uh, a ring... a ring. Ring.
- N-No, no, no, no.

726
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,143
- You can't use props.
- You can't use props.

727
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,511
- It's fine.
- Oh, no, no. It's... Keep going.

728
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,026
- It's fine. Go ahead.
- It's okay. It's okay.

729
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,914
- No, that's against the rules.
- It's fine. It's fine.

730
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,382
- Keep going.
- Engagement ring, wedding ring.

731
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,874
Uh, uh, uh...

732
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,041
I don't... Uh, uh, pr...

733
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,209
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

734
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,375
- "Lord of the Rings"!
- Yes!

735
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,712
- What?
- Major.

736
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,838
That's a good clue.

737
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,053
- Yes.
- My turn!

738
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:12,183
"My precious."

739
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,552
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh.

740
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,587
All right.

741
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:18,155
April.

742
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,158
April. April. You're... Okay.

743
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:22,593
I'll just do it myself.

744
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:23,828
- Okay.
- All right.

745
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,062
All right.

746
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,264
Uh...

747
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:28,599
Uh, bird.

748
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,167
Um...

749
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:31,307
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"!

750
00:29:31,331 --> 00:29:32,336
Ah!

751
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:33,504
Ah! Yes!

752
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:34,539
I'm s... You got that

753
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,207
from her flailing her arms?

754
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,510
We are like this.

755
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:40,945
That was impressive.

756
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,116
Can we get back to the game, please?

757
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,093
She finally got some sleep.

758
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,608
I'm going to call in the morning
to see about having her moved.

759
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,132
Parker, can you give us a minute?

760
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,438
You've always trusted me.

761
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,240
Do not think about asking me again.

762
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,976
Kimmie is suffering. She needs to eat.

763
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,322
And there's no reason not to
give her medicine that can help.

764
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:17,048
Look, it won't get her high.

765
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:19,083
I get where you're coming from.

766
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,752
My parents were addicts, too.

767
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:23,955
And Kimmie's better off than I was

768
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,301
because she has you.

769
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:31,329
I see how you support her,

770
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:32,763
how you... how you protect her,

771
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,309
and I know how hard
you fight to make sure

772
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,334
she gets the very best medical care.

773
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:39,637
And this is the best option.

774
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,269
So, I was thinking
maybe we could go to dinner

775
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,805
and we could toast your dad
and my mom and talk price.

776
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,841
Mer-Mer's all grown up.

777
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,877
I don't mean to sound crass,
but I am anxious to get started.

778
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:23,547
Sweetheart, I would love it,
but... jet lag.

779
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:24,949
- Of course.
- I'm exhausted.

780
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,184
- Okay.
- I'm gonna go back to the hotel

781
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,186
and open a mini bottle of champagne,

782
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,055
and I'm gonna celebrate your mini livers.

783
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,492
And then I'm gonna sleep
like I haven't in years.

784
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:37,228
And then, tomorrow,
we can get down to business.

785
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:38,362
Deal.

786
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,368
It's been almost too wonderful.

787
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,577
Was that Marie Cerone?

788
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:54,791
Yeah, it was.

789
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:57,525
I haven't seen her in years.

790
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,185
Uh what is she doing here?

791
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:00,918
Is she less angry?

792
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,386
What do you mean angry?

793
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,555
Meredith, she hated your mother.

794
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,323
No, she didn't. They were best friends.

795
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:07,491
Until they weren't.

796
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:08,785
What do you mean? What happened?

797
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:11,529
I heard some ugly rumors,
but I never really knew.

798
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:14,765
Dr. Webber?
Dr. Bailey's looking for you.

799
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,641
Uhh, land.

800
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:20,104
- China. Wall. Great Wall of China?
- Yes!

801
00:32:20,128 --> 00:32:21,101
- Yeah!
- Yes!

802
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:22,247
- Wow.
- Yeah.

803
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:23,951
You got Great Wall of China
from a rectangle?

804
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,420
I did. Are you gonna question
everybody's integrity,

805
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,722
or just the people I'm dating?

806
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:29,447
Hey, she questioned me...
I'm not dating you.

807
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,043
You're up, Pierce.

808
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,396
If you get this one, you win the game.

809
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,221
- Okay.
- All right, let's go.

810
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,256
- All right.
- It's a close one.

811
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,026
- Ah.
- Hmm.

812
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,497
Oh, no. This one's kind of hard.

813
00:32:43,532 --> 00:32:45,262
- Can I pass?
- Uh, no. You can't pass.

814
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,264
You got to do it.

815
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,866
- Okay.
- Mm.

816
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,134
Hey, you okay?

817
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,802
Can you stop asking me that?

818
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,140
Okay, go.

819
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,209
Uh... Mnh.

820
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,410
- Um.
- Mm.

821
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,570
It's a person.

822
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:02,246
Um...

823
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,380
It's two people.

824
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,316
Okay, they... are they...

825
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,318
- Uh-huh.
- Uh.

826
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,453
Are... Are they... What are they...

827
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,322
Are they hug... they hugging or...

828
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,624
That ain't huggin'.

829
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,426
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Aghh!

830
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,794
Oh! Oh! It's the, uh...

831
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,406
- the... the... the... the choking thing.
- Yep!

832
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,474
- The, uh... it's, uh... the... the...
- Ee!

833
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,498
...the Heimlich man...

834
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,066
- Time!
- Yes!

835
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,434
No! No!

836
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,737
It's Heimlich maneuver.

837
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:26,117
And he didn't say it.

838
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:27,895
He didn't say it when the timer went out.

839
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,517
Okay. I think he got it.
We can let that go.

840
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,190
No. No, no. No. No, no, no.

841
00:33:32,225 --> 00:33:33,366
Whoa.

842
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:35,412
No. The card says "Heimlich
maneuver," guys.

843
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:36,313
See?

844
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,649
- "Heimlich maneuver."
- April.

845
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,153
No, don't... don't "April" me.

846
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,464
There are rules, and the rules say

847
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:44,632
you have to finish before the timer.

848
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:46,490
Just like the rules to charades say

849
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,946
that you can't point to props.

850
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,361
You know, games have rules,
or they're not worth playing.

851
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,997
We can't have everything
just be chaos.

852
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,666
We can't have everything be like a void.

853
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,301
You know, can we just, like, as people

854
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,670
agree on a code of conduct and follow it?

855
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,205
Can we do that?

856
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,374
So that everything
isn't just meaningless?

857
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,219
So that we're not just like
a race of carnivorous viruses

858
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,771
just eating each other and being eaten

859
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:08,145
and nothing matters?

860
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,613
Please?

861
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,454
Brava.

862
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,833
What... Uh... what she said.

863
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:26,030
That must be Arizona and Carina.

864
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,032
I need more drinks.

865
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,971
Hi? Can I help you?

866
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,139
Is Clive here?

867
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,246
Clive. Yes!

868
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,242
Yeah, hi. I'm Maggie. I'm his girlfriend.

869
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,578
Friend. I don't... Um, we haven't really

870
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:41,812
put a label on it yet.

871
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:43,414
Well, we have. I'm Daphne.

872
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,024
I'm Clive's wife.

873
00:34:48,775 --> 00:34:51,606
- What did... You had me followed?
- I tracked your phone.

874
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,065
- You track my phone!
- 'Cause I know your M.O...

875
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,867
every time I have a work trip.

876
00:34:55,902 --> 00:34:57,913
Oh, my God, you're married?

877
00:34:57,938 --> 00:34:59,405
Oh, my God, I am so sorry!

878
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:01,240
- I had no idea.
- Of course not.

879
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:02,819
- He's an excellent liar.
- Ah, come on.

880
00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:03,853
All right, clearly this is something

881
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:05,972
you two need to deal with,
but not in this house.

882
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:07,099
Come on.

883
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,353
- Maggie, I...
- No, no, no.

884
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:09,692
Forget her address and delete
her phone number.

885
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:11,184
Let's go.

886
00:35:14,354 --> 00:35:15,584
I'm a homewrecker.

887
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:16,832
No, you're not a homewrecker.

888
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:19,525
That home was wrecked
long before you got involved.

889
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,935
We should go.

890
00:35:22,362 --> 00:35:24,197
Well, this was fun.

891
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:26,499
I've never slept
with a married man before.

892
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:27,967
Well, you can't say that anymore.

893
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:31,337
Ohh. Just rules, marriage.

894
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:33,539
More rules that no one
pays any attention to.

895
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:35,441
Just sleep with whoever.

896
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:37,610
You're not driving, are you?

897
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:41,166
Are you offering me a ride?

898
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,617
Oh. If you want one.

899
00:35:44,651 --> 00:35:46,719
This isn't spring break, Koracick.

900
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:48,521
Why don't you pay attention
to your own date?

901
00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:50,122
- April, you...
- Night!

902
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:54,984
It was lovely to meet you.

903
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,868
Are you gonna be all right?

904
00:36:03,503 --> 00:36:05,805
- You sure?
- I'm good. I'll be fine. I'm good.

905
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:17,327
There... There...
There goes the ball!

906
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:19,485
Oh, and there goes the ear!

907
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:25,258
The look on Kepner's face!

908
00:36:28,128 --> 00:36:31,864
And... And...
And her father's not gonna sue?

909
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,166
- No, no, no. He hugged Pierce.
- Oh, my God.

910
00:36:36,436 --> 00:36:38,471
No, play it again.

911
00:36:38,505 --> 00:36:39,906
Unlike the laws of science,

912
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,978
the rules of life aren't always clear.

913
00:36:42,006 --> 00:36:43,440
Hey.

914
00:36:43,465 --> 00:36:47,125
Oh. Hey. I'm heading
to game night at my house.

915
00:36:47,126 --> 00:36:49,527
I know you hate games,
but you want to come?

916
00:36:49,562 --> 00:36:51,096
Uh, no.

917
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,008
But thank you for helping me
with that kid today.

918
00:36:53,032 --> 00:36:54,120
Yeah, of course.

919
00:36:54,154 --> 00:36:55,846
- He was an idiot.
- Yeah.

920
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,821
- And I think I am, too.
- What?

921
00:36:58,822 --> 00:37:00,856
That kid was rambling about, you know,

922
00:37:00,891 --> 00:37:03,459
things he hadn't said, and...

923
00:37:03,493 --> 00:37:04,994
I was thinking about you.

924
00:37:05,028 --> 00:37:06,423
And about how great you've been.

925
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,165
About how easy you made...
just... everything.

926
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:12,168
And I'm grateful. I'm grateful for you.

927
00:37:15,605 --> 00:37:18,874
Grateful enough to give me sex?

928
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:20,543
What?

929
00:37:20,577 --> 00:37:22,545
I'm sorry. I just, um...

930
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:23,879
I miss sex.

931
00:37:23,914 --> 00:37:25,815
I mean, not the complication

932
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:29,185
or the absurdities of romance
or our crazy tumor marriage.

933
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:30,886
Just the act.

934
00:37:30,921 --> 00:37:33,556
And there are other options, but
they are less appealing options.

935
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,891
And maybe it's just that
I know how good we are at it.

936
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:38,427
Or maybe 'cause your whole
military doctor thing

937
00:37:38,462 --> 00:37:40,396
was so damn hot today!

938
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,012
But, uh...

939
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Sorry.

940
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:45,835
God. Sorry.

941
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:48,404
Uh, I-I don't want you to feel used.

942
00:37:48,438 --> 00:37:50,739
- I-I...
- Amelia.

943
00:37:54,978 --> 00:37:58,247
I want you to use me
in every way you can think of.

944
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:11,227
Lie down.

945
00:38:11,261 --> 00:38:13,129
Okay.

946
00:38:13,163 --> 00:38:14,730
All right.

947
00:38:14,764 --> 00:38:16,932
Some rules are unwritten.

948
00:38:40,123 --> 00:38:41,123
Ughh!

949
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:42,324
Ughh!

950
00:38:46,596 --> 00:38:48,264
Some rules are open to interpretation.

951
00:39:17,727 --> 00:39:20,963
Oh, my God, take the hint!

952
00:39:22,365 --> 00:39:23,632
Oh!

953
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:25,968
Jackson, what are you...

954
00:39:26,002 --> 00:39:27,113
uh, what are you doing here?

955
00:39:27,137 --> 00:39:28,637
I, uh, just took Priya home

956
00:39:28,672 --> 00:39:32,141
and... told her we couldn't
see each other anymore.

957
00:39:33,543 --> 00:39:35,511
What? What happened? Why?

958
00:39:35,545 --> 00:39:37,446
- She was so perfect.
- Yeah, she was.

959
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,049
But, um, all the time I'm with her,

960
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,051
- I am thinking about you.
- ♪ Money on my mind

961
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:47,790
Which isn't really fair to her.

962
00:39:47,824 --> 00:39:50,459
And I know what you're gonna say.

963
00:39:50,493 --> 00:39:53,362
I know you think it's
complicated, Maggie, but...

964
00:39:53,396 --> 00:39:55,497
relationships have complications.

965
00:39:55,532 --> 00:39:57,866
I mean, you can get hurt in the game,

966
00:39:57,901 --> 00:40:00,336
you can get hurt on the sidelines.

967
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,670
Hell, you can get hurt

968
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:03,505
'cause people
are secretly married.

969
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,430
How about I take you on a proper date?

970
00:40:10,547 --> 00:40:13,882
Hm? Go to that Italian place
that you won't shut up about.

971
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:16,670
Maybe we could have some wine...

972
00:40:16,704 --> 00:40:17,886
a lot of wine.

973
00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:21,724
And we could order dessert

974
00:40:21,758 --> 00:40:24,026
even though we're both full
just so we could share.

975
00:40:25,729 --> 00:40:26,929
I can get you home...

976
00:40:29,232 --> 00:40:30,512
...walk you up onto the porch...

977
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:34,903
...open the door.

978
00:40:58,795 --> 00:41:00,095
Maggie! Oh, good.

979
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,597
I need the journals!

980
00:41:01,631 --> 00:41:03,032
My mom's journals.

981
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:04,377
- What, Meredith?
- Our mom's journals.

982
00:41:04,401 --> 00:41:06,045
I need the journals.
You have to help me find them!

983
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:07,069
Please!

984
00:41:08,972 --> 00:41:12,708
I'll...
I'll give you a call, then.

985
00:41:12,742 --> 00:41:15,110
Okay. Okay.

986
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:16,979
Okay, then.

987
00:41:17,013 --> 00:41:19,782
Okay.

988
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,658
And just when we think we have
a handle on the rules...

989
00:41:31,928 --> 00:41:33,762
...something comes along...

990
00:41:39,703 --> 00:41:41,070
What's going on? Are you okay?

991
00:41:41,104 --> 00:41:42,104
No. I'm not okay.

992
00:41:42,138 --> 00:41:44,239
I showed her the mouse.
I gave her my method.

993
00:41:44,274 --> 00:41:46,108
I gave everything I had.

994
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:48,243
I got played.

995
00:41:50,113 --> 00:41:52,114
What are we doing?

996
00:41:52,148 --> 00:41:54,026
Start with these.
We're looking for Marie Cerone.

997
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,451
"MC."

998
00:41:55,485 --> 00:41:57,152
'82.

999
00:41:57,187 --> 00:41:58,954
...that totally changes the game.

1000
00:41:58,988 --> 00:42:00,622
They're all dated...

1001
00:42:01,971 --> 00:42:09,960

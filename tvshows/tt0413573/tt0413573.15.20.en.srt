<i>If given the option,
we prep our surgeries for day.</i>

2
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:09,051
<i>We study. We practice.</i>

3
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:11,154
<i>We run through it over and over
again in our minds.</i>

4
00:00:11,188 --> 00:00:13,289
Jo, it's past 7:00 already.

5
00:00:15,192 --> 00:00:17,059
Yeah, I'm still sick.

6
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:18,161
You haven't gone to work all week.

7
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:19,929
Yeah, because I'm sick.

8
00:00:19,963 --> 00:00:21,297
Maybe you should see a doctor.

9
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:22,659
No, it's just a bug.

10
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:24,467
Well, you don't have a fever.

11
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:25,635
- Stop.
- You're not throwing up.

12
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:27,436
Jo, please talk to me.

13
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:29,304
Tell me what's going on.

14
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,607
My entire body aches, Alex, okay?

15
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:34,844
It's just a bug.
Go to work so I can sleep.

16
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,749
<i>Taking on a patient's case
is not unlike marriage.</i>

17
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:42,185
<i>We get to know you.</i>

18
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:43,917
<i>Inside and out.</i>

19
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,058
When did you get the call?

20
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:51,661
Earlier this morning...
donor's in Olympia.

21
00:00:51,695 --> 00:00:54,263
- And everything checks out?
- Yeah, it's a perfect match.

22
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:55,354
Have you told her yet?

23
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,200
Well, I didn't want you to miss the fun.

24
00:00:57,234 --> 00:00:59,135
<i>You trust us with your lives.</i>

25
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:01,370
<i>And we promise to
protect and care for you.</i>

26
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:03,639
So... how did it go?

27
00:01:03,674 --> 00:01:05,374
Oh, we just finished.

28
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:07,343
Any pain or nausea? Dizziness?

29
00:01:07,377 --> 00:01:09,212
I feel annoyed.

30
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:10,398
Too many people have nothing to do

31
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:13,349
except fret over
a five-minute radiation zap.

32
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:15,218
A potato wouldn't have cooked
in the time that I was in there.

33
00:01:17,254 --> 00:01:18,454
- Mm.
- Mm.

34
00:01:18,488 --> 00:01:19,855
What?

35
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:23,693
Well, we have something for you.

36
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:24,794
A gift.

37
00:01:24,828 --> 00:01:26,295
I don't see anything.

38
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,298
It is a patient
that we brought in from L.A.

39
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,568
for an abdominal wall transplant.

40
00:01:30,603 --> 00:01:32,034
A gift implies jewelry.

41
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:35,338
We are also going to transplant
his penis and scrotum.

42
00:01:36,707 --> 00:01:38,007
Or you are...

43
00:01:39,443 --> 00:01:41,677
If you're ready to come back.

44
00:01:41,712 --> 00:01:43,045
<i>In sickness and health.</i>

45
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,184
I guess I need to
change into some scrubs.

46
00:01:49,353 --> 00:01:51,187
My baby brought me a penis!

47
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:52,255
- Yes!
- Ooh!

48
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:53,522
- Yes, yes, he did.
- Hello!

49
00:01:53,557 --> 00:01:56,425
<i>- For better or worse.
- Ooh! Yes!</i>

Hi, Leo!

54
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:15,845
How you doing? You good?

55
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,446
No, you're not, are you, buddy?

56
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:19,081
You, uh, got two molars coming in,

57
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:20,583
so you've been a terror at night.

58
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:23,185
Well, teething is a natural
biological process.

59
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,121
Don't let anyone blame you for that.

60
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:27,056
You tell Amelia that's not what I said.

61
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,691
You tell Owen he doesn't have to

62
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:30,622
communicate with me through a baby.

63
00:02:33,397 --> 00:02:34,430
The house had bay windows

64
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:36,732
- and original hardwood floors and...
- And ghosts.

65
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:38,467
Definitely ghosts
near that creepy fireplace.

66
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:40,202
Oh, fun! Reunion!

67
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:42,771
Hey, so, you're looking at houses, huh?

68
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,808
And I'm gonna go see
a consult in the pit.

69
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:49,412
Um... I'm looking at houses.

70
00:02:49,446 --> 00:02:50,780
Yeah, I went along

71
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:52,114
because I can tell you
about a house's foundation

72
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:54,050
by walking across the floor barefoot.

73
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:56,085
- It's one of my superpowers.
- Mm.

74
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:57,286
I just... I don't want to raise a baby

75
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:58,654
in a... in a hotel room.

76
00:02:58,689 --> 00:02:59,822
You know you can always stay with me.

77
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:00,790
I have plenty of room.

78
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:02,892
And baby supplies, you know.

79
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:05,127
I... No, I-I'll...
I'll figure it out, thanks.

80
00:03:05,162 --> 00:03:06,462
Okay. Well, if you need, we're here.

81
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:08,672
- Okay.
- Bye.

82
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:10,466
You know, I bet Owen's house

83
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,234
doesn't have that cute
little breakfast nook.

84
00:03:13,437 --> 00:03:14,970
You just said it was haunted.

85
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:16,339
Yeah, well...

- You needed me?
- Yes.

90
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,281
Where did you put the compliance reports

91
00:03:25,315 --> 00:03:26,716
for the Medical Boar...

92
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:30,667
You got an interview
I need to know about?

93
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,711
No. No, I just got used to

94
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,357
wearing suits, so I like them now.

95
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:36,867
Uh-huh. So, where are the reports?

96
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:40,496
Please tell me you filled them out.

97
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,598
Karev, they're due tomorrow!

98
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:44,033
What reports are those?

99
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:46,918
Chief Bailey? Sorry to interrupt,
but the students are here.

100
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:49,755
Hey, hey, you in a suit
sends a mixed message!

101
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,562
What s-s-students?

102
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:54,543
They're high schoolers
enrolled in a STEM program

103
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:55,662
to learn about leadership.

104
00:03:55,697 --> 00:03:58,814
- You agreed to it last...
- Uh, no, I have to focus,

105
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:01,484
not have ambitious teenagers
staring at me

106
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:03,119
because they don't know
how to have a conversation.

107
00:04:03,153 --> 00:04:06,288
So, I'm delegating...
you take them, and...

108
00:04:06,323 --> 00:04:08,957
- Hello.
- Welcome.

109
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:13,396
I am your... chief.

110
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:20,744
- Hey.
- Hey.

111
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:24,073
Um, hey, have you worked
with Webber since the...?

112
00:04:24,107 --> 00:04:25,141
- The party?
- Mm-hmm.

113
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:27,243
No. You know, I've actually
managed to avoid it.

114
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:29,419
He gave me a lap appy.

115
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,714
What do you mean he gave you a lap appy?

116
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:33,349
He said, "DeLuca, today's your lucky day.

117
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:35,592
I've got a lap appy,
and I'm giving it to you."

118
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:37,319
- Wow.
- Huh?

119
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:38,438
You think it's strange, too?

120
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:40,089
I think it's a test you ought not fail.

121
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:41,957
What kind of test? Like a surgical test,

122
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:43,592
or like a "You're dating Meredith Grey

123
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:45,394
and I don't know if I approve" test?

124
00:04:45,429 --> 00:04:47,196
Who cares? It's an appy. You got it.

125
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,320
I got to go get a penis.

126
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,765
Okay. Wait. What?

127
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,066
A penis?

128
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:53,569
DeLuca, we got OR 2.

129
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:55,404
Okay. Thank you, sir. I-I
really appreciate this.

130
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,615
I'm... I'm looking forward to it.

131
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,307
I should hope so. All right.

135
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:08,951
day 16 of cough
and recurrent sinus infection.

136
00:05:08,985 --> 00:05:10,686
He's been listless, tired...

137
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,055
Really pale. And just... not himself.

138
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:14,390
Every Saturday, we get bagels

139
00:05:14,424 --> 00:05:15,558
and eat them outside the Smith Tower.

140
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:16,759
It's Gus's thing.

141
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:19,195
He loves the history, knows
every single thing about it.

142
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:20,362
We haven't been in three weeks.

143
00:05:20,397 --> 00:05:21,697
We'll figure out what's going on.

Gus is autistic.

147
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:29,638
He struggles with being
physically touched.

148
00:05:29,673 --> 00:05:30,806
Is he in any pain?

149
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:32,062
I mean, it's hard to tell.

150
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:34,643
He... He just doesn't
communicate like other kids do.

151
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:36,579
Well, there are things we can
try that may help. May I?

152
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:37,779
Uh, please.

You know, if you look out
that window over there,

160
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:54,396
you just might see the Space Needle.

Wanna try?

162
00:05:57,634 --> 00:05:59,768
And while you look over there,

163
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:01,403
I'm just gonna take a look
in your eyes real quick...

164
00:06:01,438 --> 00:06:02,671
Gus.

165
00:06:02,706 --> 00:06:03,672
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

166
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:04,773
- It's okay. It's okay, Gus.
- It's all right.

167
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:06,242
Should I get the O2?

168
00:06:07,477 --> 00:06:08,944
Slowly breathe in.

169
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:10,312
How are we supposed to help him?

170
00:06:10,347 --> 00:06:11,680
We get creative.

171
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:13,616
Breathe out. Breathe in.

172
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,017
All right.

173
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:17,186
Just breathe.

174
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,522
Hey, let's go!

175
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:21,490
- Hello?
- Oh! Megan!

176
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:23,626
- Hi, Meredith!
- Hi!

177
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,127
How are you? I'm good!

178
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:27,329
You look fantastic! Are you well?

179
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:28,631
How are you feeling? What's happening?

180
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:30,032
- Is there...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

181
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,200
- Did you want to look at it?
- Yes!

182
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:35,604
- There you go.
- Wow.

183
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,640
I know. Hey!

184
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:39,708
This stomach won the
Catherine Fox Award, people.

185
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:41,677
You should all be looking at it, too.

186
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:43,012
That looks really good.

187
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:44,179
Yeah. Well, you did it.

188
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:47,149
So, now, tell me... there's
no pain, no tenderness, no...?

189
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:48,317
Nothing. And by the way,
lifting up my shirt

190
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:50,819
was how I convinced my patient
to get the same surgery,

191
00:06:50,854 --> 00:06:52,388
so, you know, don't mess up.

192
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:54,089
Fantastic. I'm on my way
to do the procurement now.

193
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:55,477
- Mm-hmm.
- And just for the record,

194
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:57,726
I did not tell Teddy and Owen
that you were coming,

195
00:06:57,761 --> 00:06:59,361
in case you want to surprise them.

196
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:00,896
Teddy?

197
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:02,197
Teddy's here?

198
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:04,033
Yes, Teddy is here.

199
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:06,135
Oh, my God.

200
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:08,304
Oh. Bed 3's ready to go up to CT...

201
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:09,872
Yep. Oh.

202
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:11,674
- Oh, no.
- What?

203
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,642
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

204
00:07:13,677 --> 00:07:14,743
What?

205
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:15,878
What is wrong with you?!

206
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:17,886
Hey, Megan, before you get
started, I just want to...

207
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,481
Why didn't you tell me that you two

208
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:21,250
had finally gotten together?!

209
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:24,053
And we're having a baby?!

210
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:25,821
Oh, my God, come on!

211
00:07:25,855 --> 00:07:27,256
I am so happy!

212
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,724
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

213
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:29,758
Um, Megan...

214
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:30,926
Um...

215
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:32,227
- Megan.
- Oh, God.

216
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:35,998
- Um.
- What?

217

218
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,594
Megan? Just making sure you're okay...

219
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:51,462
Uh...

220
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:52,963
She's okay. She's... She's processing.

221
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:54,196
Right? You're processing?

222
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,700
I mean, it's a lot to process.

223
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:57,234
Yeah.

224
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,270
Yeah. It's a lot.

225
00:07:59,304 --> 00:08:02,707
It's just so much stupidity

226
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:04,775
that my brain is struggling
to take it all in.

227
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,277
- Okay, Megan, come on...
- I mean...

228
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:08,700
so much stupidity.

229
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:11,048
You went to Germany for one night,

230
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,216
knocked her up,

231
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,085
and then screwed it up so badly

232
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,121
that you gave her your job
instead of a ring?!

233
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:18,192
You dum-dum!

234
00:08:18,226 --> 00:08:19,423
Oh, are you calling me dum-dum? Are we 6?

235
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,058
No, Owen, we are stone-cold adults.

236
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:23,160
But what you did here is so stupid

237
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:24,729
that the word "idiot"
felt too sophisticated,

238
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:25,963
so, yes, I'm sticking with "dum-dum"!

239
00:08:25,997 --> 00:08:27,088
Do you...

240
00:08:27,122 --> 00:08:28,899
Well, I-I kind of want to defend you,

241
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:30,827
but it never goes well when
I get in between you and Megan.

242
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:32,453
- Oh.
- She's lying. That's a lie.

243
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:34,004
She doesn't want to defend you, Owen.

244
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,973
She wants to call you something
way worse than "dum-dum."

245
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:37,100
For the record?

246
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:38,442
This is exactly why I didn't tell you.

247
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:41,178
No. It was your own deep-seated shame.

248
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:42,446
Ugh, so you're a shrink now?

249
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,981
- Altman.
- Mnh.

250
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:45,449
247 Lawndale.

251
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,584
I'll check it out. Great, thanks.

252
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,486
No, no, you got to see it,
and soon. It's, uh, perfect.

253
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,588
Is, uh, this your Realtor?

254
00:08:50,622 --> 00:08:53,524
Um. No. Um...

255
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:55,352
- This is my... This is my boyfriend.
- Ah.

256
00:08:55,387 --> 00:08:56,794
- Um...
- Ah.

257
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,696
Uh, Megan, Tom. Tom, Megan.

258
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,097
Megan Hunt.

259
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,701
- Dum-dum.
- Sorry?

260
00:09:03,735 --> 00:09:05,136
Not you.

261
00:09:09,808 --> 00:09:13,677
And then, I isolate
the pudendal nerve, and you...

262
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:18,015
Hello?

263
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:20,351
Yeah. The, um, trickiest part of an appy

264
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:22,787
is if it's retrocecal, right?

265
00:09:22,821 --> 00:09:23,954
Why?

266
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:26,056
Because Andrew is doing an appy today

267
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:28,159
- with Richard.
- DeLuca?

268
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,994
- Yeah.
- He'll be fine.

269
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,462
DeLuca's passed appys.

270
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:34,465
Now, can you
pay attention to this, please?

271
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:36,801
Sure. I... I won an award for this.

272
00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:38,068
And I didn't because I was nice enough

273
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:39,236
to take my name off of it.

274
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:40,471
- Remember?
- Mm.

275
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:42,373
This is a whole different Ba...

276
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:45,676
What? Were you just about
to say "ball game"?

277
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,478
I was gonna say it's important
that we don't mess this up.

278
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:48,913
- Okay.
- All right? That we get it right.

279
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:50,407
It's my mom's first surgery back.

280
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,250
Yeah, I was gonna say "ball game."

281
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:03,503
Oh, you're pretty good at that.

282
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:06,363
It takes 41 seconds to ride the elevator

283
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,591
to the top of the Space Needle.

284
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:11,101
- Yeah.
- On a non-windy day.

285
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:13,070
Really? That seems fast.

286
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:14,456
It is.

287
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,210
Gus, do you ever get
a pain in your chest?

288
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,448
Like, when you take a walk,

289
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:21,912
does it hurt a little to breathe?

290
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:26,016
Does it hurt a lot? Or a little?

291
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,531
Does it hurt... this much?

292
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,692
Or more?

293
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,809
That much?

294
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:52,977
Let's get a chest CT.

295
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,583
You got through to him.

296
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,051
Yeah, let me know when the scans are up.

297
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:02,953
<i>Dr. Brody, call Radiology.</i>

298
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:04,889
<i>Dr. Jeannette Brody, call Radiology.</i>

299
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:06,889
Hey. Have you talked to Jo

300
00:11:06,923 --> 00:11:08,792
since she got back
from visiting her birth mom?

301
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:10,661
Jo found her birth mom? Whoa.

302
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:12,096
- What happened?
- I-I don't know.

303
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,964
But it wasn't good. She won't talk to me.

304
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,300
She won't return
Meredith's calls or Bailey's.

305
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:17,768
She won't come to work.

306
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,337
But she trusts you.
Maybe you can talk to her?

307
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:22,506
- Be like her... her Legos, or...
- Huh?

308
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,976
Just maybe you can reach her,
or... or distract her.

309
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:27,244
I-I don't know what.

310
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,313
- Can you try? Please?
- Yeah.

311
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:31,315
Uh, I'll move some stuff around.

312
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:33,317
Thanks.

313
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:38,188
Oh! You're in here.

314
00:11:38,223 --> 00:11:40,591
- Hey, can you...
- I'm sorry. I need your room.

315
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,259
I just had a stupid
elevator ride with Owen,

316
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:43,798
which was... pain.

317
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:45,162
It was painful.

318
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:46,263
Which you would think it wouldn't be.

319
00:11:46,298 --> 00:11:47,331
I mean, I'm having great sex.

320
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:49,199
I'm having aerobic sex!

321
00:11:49,234 --> 00:11:50,534
I mean, I'm waking up with endorphins...

322
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:55,706
Dr. Shepherd, meet the students

323
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,875
from the STEM leadership program.

324
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:01,245
Dr. Shepherd is our
chief of neurosurgery.

325
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:06,216
Who can define "endorphins"?

326
00:12:12,324 --> 00:12:14,191
Okay. Uh.

327
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:17,294
Alicia Davis, 24, admitted
with severe abdominal pain...

328
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,663
...which then localized
in the right-lower quadrant.

329
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,698
Inability to keep food down...

330
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:21,983
Which was weird,

331
00:12:22,018 --> 00:12:24,702
because I'm pretty ruthless
about what I put into my body.

332
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:26,870
You are, too, I bet, look at you.

333
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,239
Uh.

334
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:32,209
Right, um, which made sense, then,

335
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:34,712
when the CT showed
an inflamed appendix...

336
00:12:34,746 --> 00:12:36,246
Do you CrossFit, bro?

337
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:37,421
I'm a CrossFit fiend.

338
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,049
Uh, no. Sadly, no time.

339
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:40,985
I could train you. Or with you.

340
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:42,152
I'm the real deal.

341
00:12:42,187 --> 00:12:44,355
I have almost a million followers

342
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,422
on Instagram.

343
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:46,465
- See?
- That's okay.

344
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,660
- Just look!
- Really, I'm good.

345
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:49,994
I just want to get you prepped
for surgery.

346
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:52,596
Uh, patient care includes

347
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:55,366
putting the patient at ease, Dr. DeLuca.

348
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,010
Right.

349
00:12:57,593 --> 00:12:59,236
Let's have a look.

350
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,683
I'm hot, right?

351
00:13:04,376 --> 00:13:06,343
I'm saying, don't leave a scar.

352
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:07,945
Uh-huh.

353
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,587
Caleb Hicks, 29,

354
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,255
here for an abdominal wall,

355
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:19,690
penis and scrotum transplant.

356
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:21,458
He sustained major injuries

357
00:13:21,493 --> 00:13:23,260
to his lower extremities and pelvic area

358
00:13:23,294 --> 00:13:25,396
during an IED blast in Afghanistan

359
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,526
about a year ago.

360
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,598
Are you her?

361
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,400
Are you Catherine Fox?

362
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,474
Indeed.

363
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:31,735
It's a pleasure to meet you, Caleb.

364
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,405
You're a legend to
the online support groups,

365
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,306
like the Neil Armstrong of Johnsons.

366
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:39,109
I'll take that. I'll take...

367
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:42,379
Well, I just want to make sure
that you're completely clear

368
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:44,148
about the extent of this surgery.

369
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:46,383
Not only is it a massive piece of tissue

370
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:47,677
from another man's body,

371
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,355
but the recovery is...

372
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,381
It's rough. I know.

373
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:55,292
Dr. Hunt explained it to me
in L.A., and I can do it.

374
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:56,894
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

375
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:59,329
And my mom came in from Reno to help out.

376
00:13:59,364 --> 00:14:01,565
I'll be here until Anna gets back.

377
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:03,667
Anna's my fiancée.

378
00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:05,502
She's on an Air Force mission
for 10 days,

379
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:07,638
- and then she's on nursing duty.
- Okay.

380
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,666
Then we will come back and prep you

381
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,308
as soon as Dr. Avery and Dr. Grey

382
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:12,776
are on their way with the organ,

383
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,700
and... and then both Dr. Hunts

384
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:17,559
- will be assisting me in the OR.
- Both?

385
00:14:17,593 --> 00:14:20,250
Oh, yes, this is
a very complex procedure.

386
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:22,119
We're gonna need
an additional set of hands,

387
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,154
so I thought Caleb would be
most comfortable

388
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:25,756
with another veteran.

389
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,991
- Oh.
- It's nice to meet you.

390
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:30,327
- Okay.
- Hello.

391
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:38,335
I know you're in there!

392
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:39,870
So...

393
00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:41,839
I'll just keep knocking.

394
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,783
Chicken soup?

395
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:53,884
Heard you were sick.

396
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:54,952
I'm not hungry.

397
00:14:56,588 --> 00:14:58,489
This Chinese joint on Weller...

398
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,525
they sell out most days
because it is so good.

399
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,494
You shouldn't be in here.
I'm... I'm contagious.

400
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,395
I'm throwing up sick.

401
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,965
Do you want it in a bowl,
or just out of the container?

402
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:09,533
I don't want any...

403
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,568
Brought some for myself, too.

404
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:13,704
Mmm. Soup.

405
00:15:17,175 --> 00:15:18,408
Whatever.

406
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:34,508
Okay. Once we have positioned
the donor tissue,

407
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:36,357
- we'll start by connecting the urethra.
- What's next?

408
00:15:36,391 --> 00:15:38,095
- Corpus cavernosum?
- Exactly.

409
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,255
So, do we know which vessels
we're getting from the donor?

410
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:42,815
Schmitt, vessels... that's the next
thing we'll anastomose. Name them.

411
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,160
Megan, I'm just trying to
get up to speed here, so...

412
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,729
Go, Schmitt.

413
00:15:46,763 --> 00:15:48,864
Dorsal, deep dorsal, superficial dorsal,

414
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,532
superficial pudendal, femoral...

415
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,000
Greater saphenous and deep epigastric.

416
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,435
Listen, I am sorry

417
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,170
I didn't tell you everything,
but it's complicated...

418
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:56,405
Now let's talk about the nerves.

419
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:57,473
And it's my life,

420
00:15:57,507 --> 00:15:59,775
and I get to decide when
I share important details...

421
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:00,843
Should I leave?

422
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,044
- No.
- Please.

423
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:04,213
Listen, before we go in this OR,

424
00:16:04,247 --> 00:16:05,881
I want to make sure that we're okay.

425
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:07,850
Do you know how long I've been
working with Caleb?

426
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:08,923
10 months.

427
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,552
And now we are finally here,
and he is ready,

428
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:12,187
and I don't have time to deal with

429
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,622
your constant need
to make everything okay.

430
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:15,190
What I do need right now is to make sure

431
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,792
that you understand
the steps of this procedure.

432
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:19,228
- Do you?
- Yes.

433
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:20,429
Okay, nerves.

434
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:21,597
We want to do the nerve coaptation

435
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:23,465
as far distally as we can.

436
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,802
<i>Dr. Thatcher...
Dr. Kirsten Thatcher, 6411.</i>

437
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:34,376
You're good on your plane dissection?

438
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,279
- Yes. Time, please?
- We barely started.

439
00:16:37,313 --> 00:16:39,314
I'm thinking about the appy.
They're quick.

440
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:40,983
They should be finished by now,
don't you think?

441
00:16:41,017 --> 00:16:42,317
Richard's with him. He'll be fine.

442
00:16:42,352 --> 00:16:43,352
Right, well, that's the problem.

443
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:45,454
At your party, Andrew and I
were having a moment,

444
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:46,889
and Richard kind of walked...

445
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,957
Oh. He caught you.

446
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:49,892
Yes.

447
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,494
Well, he caught me and Maggie once, too.

448
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:54,329
I felt like I was 14.

449
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:55,497
What is that about?

450
00:16:55,532 --> 00:16:58,267
Don't worry about that.
Worry about the appy patient.

451
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:00,169
If you're feeling this nervous,
imagine how DeLuca feels.

452
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:01,737
It's just an appy.

453
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,072
So simple. Yet so easy to overthink.

454
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,307
I hate you.

455
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:10,012
Have you seen a picture of it?

456
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:12,314
Yes. You'll be happy.

457
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:14,283
Happy how?

458
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,319
What's it look like?

459
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:21,256
- It looks... healthy.
- Come on.

460
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,258
Could you at least tell him
the donor's shoe size?

461
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,760
Geez.

462
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,261
Caleb, look who's here.

463
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,030
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

464
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:29,264
Anna! You made it!

465
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,532
Get out.

466
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:32,167
Caleb, your mom called me...

467
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:35,137
I don't want her here.
She needs to leave!

468
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:36,271
Get her out now!

469
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,307
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
- Whoa.

470
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,182
That's a large mass
on the thymus gland. How old?

471
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:49,117
Uh, 10.

472
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,186
In kids, thymomas are always malignant,

473
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:53,856
but, luckily, resecting them
can be completely curative.

474
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,157
I can scrub in.

475
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,784
_

476
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:01,814
Hey, Jo's been out all week.
Is everything okay?

477
00:18:02,304 --> 00:18:03,971
I'll book the OR.

478
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,136
Gus is severely anemic...

479
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,872
we can't operate until we transfuse him.

480
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,790
I know what you're doing.

481
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,684
Just laundry. Not that big a mystery.

482
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:24,520
You're checking on me. I don't need it.

483
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:26,555
I just need to go to sleep.

484
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:28,557
Do you have a basket or something?

485
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,158
Please leave.

486
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:37,099
Do you remember Bronwyn Murphy?

487
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:40,102
Your redheaded bartender girlfriend

488
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:42,104
with the "Texas" tattoo?

489
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,074
Remember when she dumped me?

490
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:47,376
- Vaguely.
- Vaguely?

491
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,044
I drank for three days.

492
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:50,913
I-I missed so much work,
I almost got fired.

493
00:18:50,947 --> 00:18:52,014
So what's your point?

494
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,183
I was a shell.

495
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,411
I couldn't move.

496
00:18:56,446 --> 00:19:00,122
But I had this friend
who came over to my place,

497
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:01,924
even though all I wanted in the world

498
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,292
was to be left alone.

499
00:19:03,326 --> 00:19:05,961
In fact, I told her that. Several times.

500
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:08,997
But... she stayed.

501
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,367
And she did my laundry.

502
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,435
So this is revenge?

503
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:16,004
It's just a friend
doing another friend's laundry.

504
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:27,282
Oh, I'd give the soup
another minute to cool.

505
00:19:27,317 --> 00:19:29,384
I'm pretty sure
they boil it before they...

506
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,458
Don't mind if I do.

507
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:38,627
I wasn't offering.

508
00:19:39,935 --> 00:19:41,436
I'll take one, anyway.

509
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,008
- Why would you call her?
- She said you needed me.

510
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:54,910
- Right!
- So I dropped everything, and I came...

511
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,079
despite being dumped nine months ago

512
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,513
with no explanation.

513
00:19:58,548 --> 00:19:59,648
What do you mean, dumped?

514
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:01,850
You told me she was gonna take
care of you after surgery,

515
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:03,518
when she got back from...

516
00:20:03,553 --> 00:20:05,354
- Where were you assigned?
- No, I'm not on assignment.

517
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:06,488
I came from San Diego.

518
00:20:06,522 --> 00:20:08,523
- What surgery?
- Lord.

519
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:10,826
Are you getting a procedure for a
prosthetic leg or something...?

520
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,793
It's none of her business.

521
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:13,362
She's supposed to be
your support system...

522
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:15,364
you listed her in your evaluation.

523
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:16,531
You knew that having a support system

524
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:18,834
was essential for you
being able to get this surgery.

525
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,535
- You knew that.
- What surgery?!

526
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,271
Can we please
just get everyone out of here

527
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:24,640
and then do my surgery?

528
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:27,809
Okay? And then I'll leave everyone alone.

529
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:34,483
Caleb's been prepping for months.

530
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:36,118
- You can't just say no.
- The hell I can't.

531
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,285
Catherine, just wait a minute.

532
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,654
We got it... everything's intact.

533
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:39,788
Why isn't everyone in the OR?

534
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,456
The surgery is off!

535
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:44,526
I'm not giving that man a penis today.

536
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:47,996
Any questions about the urology floor?

537
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:55,451
I'm creating a window at the
base of the mesoappendix now.

538
00:20:55,452 --> 00:20:58,354
- You're good to get it? Or...
- Yes. Absolutely.

539
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:00,323
What's your plan here?

540
00:21:00,357 --> 00:21:01,591
Excuse me?

541
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,814
Where do you see this going? Long-term?

542
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:08,667
Sir, I...

543
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:11,834
We've not really had
those discussions yet.

544
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:13,469
Uh, I mean, she's got a family.

545
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:14,704
That informs where she's coming from...

546
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:16,205
and I certainly want to respect that.

547
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,640
But, uh, for me?

548
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:19,108
She's amazing, sir.

549
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:20,109
She makes me so happy.

550
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:21,110
You know, I'm... I'm... She...

551
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:22,545
I'm gonna stop you right now

552
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:23,713
because my question was...

553
00:21:23,747 --> 00:21:25,982
...where do you see
your <i>surgical</i> career going,

554
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:27,227
long-term?

555
00:21:27,262 --> 00:21:28,784
And whether you've thought
about a specialty.

556
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:30,052
Um.

557
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:32,221
Oh, right. Uh... shoot.

558
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:37,160
Well, uh, g-general surgery...
is attractive.

559
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:40,129
What a surprise.

560
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:41,364
All right, do you see that, sir?

561
00:21:41,398 --> 00:21:43,332
- Is that a dead bowel?
- It is.

562
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:45,434
The terminal ileum's been compromised.
What do you want to do?

563
00:21:45,469 --> 00:21:47,503
I think we need to convert
to an open procedure.

564
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:48,638
- What do you think?
- I think you're right.

565
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,306
All right, let's pull the trocars.

566
00:21:57,915 --> 00:22:00,383
Ma, it's gonna be
a grueling surgery, all right?

567
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,218
You haven't been
in the OR in a while now.

568
00:22:02,252 --> 00:22:05,021
The patient is not mentally
or emotionally prepared

569
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:06,856
for a transplant.

570
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,891
We're taking a piece
of another person's body

571
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:10,593
and putting it onto his.

572
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:13,029
He needs a support team for that,

573
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:15,097
just like I had for my own surgery.

574
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:17,500
As much as all the constant
nagging and worrying

575
00:22:17,534 --> 00:22:19,168
makes me crazy...

576
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:22,505
if I didn't have you or Richard,

577
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:24,618
I couldn't have done any of this.

578
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,376
The surgery is off.

579
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:32,448
And don't you dare accuse me
of being scared or tired.

580
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:33,950
Even though I'm a little bit of both,

581
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,547
but that is not the reason.

582
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:43,259
<i>Dr. Lowe to Maternity.</i>

583
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:46,128
<i>Dr. Kathy Lowe to Maternity.</i>

584
00:22:46,163 --> 00:22:48,809
Uh, I think she's right. I'm sorry.

585
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:52,902
Keep everything on ice,
keep everybody close, okay?

586
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:54,637
I'm gonna fix this...
I just need to talk to Caleb.

587
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:55,638
I'll do it.

588
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:57,540
No, Owen. It's my patient.

589
00:22:57,574 --> 00:22:58,774
I don't need you to swoop in
and save the day.

590
00:22:58,809 --> 00:22:59,909
Do you have a penis?

591
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:08,050
I cannot believe this is the <i>one</i> time

592
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:10,119
this could make a difference.

593
00:23:10,153 --> 00:23:11,302
Fine. Just don't screw it up

594
00:23:11,336 --> 00:23:12,455
like you screwed up
the rest of your life.

595
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:19,895
Okay, now, you have to run
the bowel through your...

596
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,565
From the ligament of Treitz
all the way down... I did.

597
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,066
- Okay, make sure you feel for...
- Wait. Sir, hold on.

598
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:25,101
Is...

599
00:23:25,135 --> 00:23:27,103
Is this... Is it a Meckel's band?

600
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:29,605
It is. What is it?

601
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,973
Meckel's diverticulum,

602
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:33,643
a congenital anomaly
of the small intestine.

603
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:36,679
The band seems to be kinking off
the blood supply.

604
00:23:36,713 --> 00:23:38,014
I have to do an ileocecectomy.

605
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:39,682
No. You don't. <i>I</i> do.

606
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:41,684
- It's my surgery.
- No, your surgery was an appy.

607
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:42,905
This was an incidental finding.

608
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,654
Yeah, but it's <i>my incidental finding.</i>

609
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:46,956
- DeLuca...
- I staple off the area of necrosis.

610
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,524
You don't even know what stapler to use.

611
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,261
GIA 60 with 3.8-millimeter staples.

612
00:24:01,571 --> 00:24:02,838
This one, right?

613
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:06,642
In kids, the thymus gland helps regulate

614
00:24:06,677 --> 00:24:08,444
the body's immune responses.

615
00:24:08,478 --> 00:24:09,679
But since he has a tumor there...

616
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:11,714
His gland isn't working properly,

617
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:13,382
so it's causing all sorts of symptoms...

618
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:15,885
uh, his cough, his fatigue,
his discomfort.

619
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,153
But this transfusion should help

620
00:24:17,187 --> 00:24:18,554
get his red blood cell count up,

621
00:24:18,588 --> 00:24:20,156
correcting the anemia.

622
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,361
- And then you'll do the surgery?
- Correct.

623
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:25,661
God, a tumor. And anemia.

624
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:27,963
I just thought we were gonna
take out his tonsils.

625
00:24:27,998 --> 00:24:29,665
Dr. Karev!

626
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:33,235
Give him space, or you'll scare him more.

627
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,905
Sweetie, you're all right.

628
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:37,707
You need to pull the IV.
Can you back up, please?

629
00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:38,874
H-He doesn't like to be touched.

630
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:40,710
It's not a panic attack.
It's a reaction to the blood.

631
00:24:40,744 --> 00:24:42,745
Why? Why is he reacting to the blood?

632
00:24:44,748 --> 00:24:46,082
It's okay, Gus. It's okay.

633
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:48,718
We've got you. All right, Gus.

634
00:24:48,752 --> 00:24:51,020
Good, good. Take a deep breath.

635
00:24:56,193 --> 00:24:57,860
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

636
00:24:57,894 --> 00:25:00,162
Oh, I'm trying to
find a place for my baby

637
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:02,264
that doesn't share walls with strangers

638
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:05,401
who can hear her wail all night
while I fail at new parenting.

639
00:25:05,435 --> 00:25:06,618
And apparently,

640
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:08,571
it has to be in a good school district.

641
00:25:16,813 --> 00:25:18,748
You're house-hunting.

642
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:20,549
With another guy, Teddy?

643
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:22,952
I... I'm not moving in with Tom.

644
00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:24,620
He's... He's just...
You know, he's helping...

645
00:25:24,654 --> 00:25:26,389
I watched you suffer from afar for years,

646
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:27,790
I watched you love him for years,

647
00:25:27,824 --> 00:25:30,025
and then I watched you suffer some more.

648
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,628
I'm sure the neurosurgeon is... lovely,

649
00:25:32,662 --> 00:25:34,630
but my brother is single.

650
00:25:34,664 --> 00:25:36,298
And you love him.
And you've always loved him.

651
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,900
And he's an idiot, but he loves you, too.

652
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:39,702
And now he has Leo and a crib,

653
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:41,404
and I know for sure that
he would want you to move in,

654
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:43,739
and... and then... and...

655
00:25:43,774 --> 00:25:46,375
It can be easy, and it can evolve.

656
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,811
Megan, I'm not gonna m-move
in to that house.

657
00:25:48,845 --> 00:25:49,812
I-I... And... what...

658
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:52,415
just... slide into
Amelia's place in their bed?

659
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:54,450
I mean, that is not gonna happen.

660
00:25:54,484 --> 00:25:55,985
And, I mean, Megan, if it were you,

661
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:59,541
you would burn the house down
before you moved into it.

662
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,259
I would.

663
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:06,829
Totally would.

664
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:08,764
I totally would.

665
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,733
I am so happy you're here.

666
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:13,736
- So, where were you stationed?
- Near Kandahar.

667
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,183
- Not a lot of trees.
- No.

668
00:26:16,706 --> 00:26:19,141
I, uh, spent most of my time in Fallujah.

669
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:21,310
When I got back, I would...

670
00:26:21,344 --> 00:26:23,646
still kick my shoes out for sand.

671
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,347
It's a kind of habit, I guess.

672
00:26:25,382 --> 00:26:26,682
Don't have that problem anymore.

673
00:26:28,385 --> 00:26:30,447
Yeah.

674
00:26:31,354 --> 00:26:32,955
I didn't lie to Anna.

675
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:34,178
When I broke up with her,

676
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:35,658
I told her I wasn't right in the head.

677
00:26:35,692 --> 00:26:36,926
And I wasn't.

678
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,961
You went through something terrible.

679
00:26:38,995 --> 00:26:41,163
Took one wrong step,
and I became a monster.

680
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:42,288
Nobody thinks that.

681
00:26:42,322 --> 00:26:45,337
I woke up, and a part of me was missing.

682
00:26:45,836 --> 00:26:47,136
And I'm not talking about my leg.

683
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,216
I can live with one leg.

684
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:52,475
I didn't feel like a man anymore.

685
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:54,096
I didn't know if I could live like that,

686
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,979
and I didn't want Anna to live
like that, either.

687
00:26:57,013 --> 00:26:58,781
Yeah.

688
00:26:58,815 --> 00:27:00,850
You know, I was in
an explosion over there, too.

689
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:02,718
I didn't suffer like you have, but...

690
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,982
I, uh...

691
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:07,289
I lost my whole platoon.

692
00:27:07,324 --> 00:27:08,724
- Damn.
- Yeah.

693
00:27:08,758 --> 00:27:09,956
They sent me home,

694
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:12,027
and I broke up with my fiancée

695
00:27:12,062 --> 00:27:13,762
with a three-line e-mail.

696
00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:16,799
I mean, she wasn't right for me,

697
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,287
but I'm still ashamed
of how I treated her.

698
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:21,498
Anna's...

699
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:23,792
She's right for me.

700
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:26,586
She's everything. She's my...

701
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:29,912
She was my everything.

702
00:27:29,946 --> 00:27:31,847
You owe her better than what she got.

703
00:27:33,884 --> 00:27:35,818
Give her a chance, Caleb.

704
00:27:35,852 --> 00:27:37,639
You know, talk to her.

705
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:40,356
Sometimes, when you give people a chance,

706
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,540
they show up in ways
you wouldn't believe.

707
00:27:58,129 --> 00:28:00,363
And he just told her the truth?

708
00:28:00,364 --> 00:28:02,782
He did. And she's not going anywhere.

709
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:04,584
And this is supposed to change my mind?

710
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:07,120
Him having one conversation?

711
00:28:07,627 --> 00:28:09,289
Catherine, I know this guy.

712
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:10,924
I've <i>been</i> this guy.

713
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:12,292
When I came back, I wasn't myself.

714
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:13,860
I did things that I wasn't proud of...

715
00:28:13,895 --> 00:28:15,095
it took me several months

716
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:16,496
just to knock on my mom's door

717
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:18,098
to tell her that I was home.

718
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:20,700
And I didn't lose a part of my body.

719
00:28:20,735 --> 00:28:22,102
Catherine, I operated on guys over there,

720
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:23,280
and when they woke up,

721
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:25,505
the first question they would ask was,

722
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,884
"Is it still there?"

723
00:28:26,925 --> 00:28:28,942
And they weren't talking about
their legs or their arms.

724
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:32,312
Every time Caleb changes his clothes,

725
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:36,116
goes to the bathroom,
looks down... he's triggered.

726
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,018
So I believe this surgery

727
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:40,020
is what he needs to move forward.

728
00:28:40,054 --> 00:28:42,055
I believe this will help him far more

729
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:43,657
than it could possibly hurt him.

730
00:28:49,931 --> 00:28:51,197
What do you mean, you don't know?

731
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:52,306
I mean, I don't know!

732
00:28:52,341 --> 00:28:54,801
I read the crossmatch as AB... he got AB.

733
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:56,670
We do not give children the wrong blood

734
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,871
in this hospital, Karev.

735
00:28:57,905 --> 00:29:00,340
We do not give adults the wrong
blood in this hospital.

736
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:01,908
So, someone, please explain to me

737
00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:04,811
what the hell is going on
and how this isn't a lawsuit,

738
00:29:04,845 --> 00:29:06,746
so I can lower my voice!

739
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:09,182
You see this, girls? This is leadership.

740
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:10,650
We're running a second crossmatch

741
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:11,751
to check his blood type again.

742
00:29:11,786 --> 00:29:12,858
His chart says AB.

743
00:29:12,893 --> 00:29:14,187
It's gotta be something else, right?

744
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:16,256
Second crossmatch is up.

745
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,524
He's definitely AB.

746
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:19,159
Positive or negative? Neither.

747
00:29:19,193 --> 00:29:20,860
- What?
- Huh?

748
00:29:20,895 --> 00:29:22,262
He's Rh-Null.

749
00:29:22,296 --> 00:29:23,663
What is that?

750
00:29:23,698 --> 00:29:25,265
That's golden blood.

751
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:28,501
It's a rare blood type
that lacks all Rh antigens.

752
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:32,005
No positive, no negative.
I've never seen this.

753
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,195
How rare is rare?

754
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,941
Pretty rare, 'cause
I've never heard of it.

755
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:37,410
Less than 50 people have been
documented to have it.

756
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:44,050
Close with 2-0 PDS? Good call.

757
00:29:44,085 --> 00:29:45,809
All right, clamps.

758
00:29:46,621 --> 00:29:49,122
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

759
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:50,240
I overstepped. I was...

760
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:53,393
Terse. A little more terse
than necessary.

761
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:54,663
I'm sorry. I just...

762
00:29:54,698 --> 00:29:56,463
I-I could see the whole
procedure in my head.

763
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:57,646
You know, you gave me the case...

764
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,066
I wanted to do the case
from start to finish.

765
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:02,033
I wanted to show you
that I was worthy of...

766
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,537
Malleable?

767
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:07,539
Worthy of what?

768
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:09,909
A career in general surgery.

769
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:11,911
Well, Dr. Grey's head of that department.

770
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:14,481
- It's not up to me.
- Of course.

771
00:30:14,515 --> 00:30:17,317
I could put in a good word.

772
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:18,918
Or are you set there?

773
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:22,322
That would be great, sir. Thank you.

774
00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:23,990
You got this?

775
00:30:24,025 --> 00:30:25,225
Yes, sir.

776
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:32,565
So, how did you convince
your mother to do the surgery?

777
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,167
Oh, I didn't. That was all Hunt.

778
00:30:34,201 --> 00:30:35,402
Basically, I just accused her

779
00:30:35,436 --> 00:30:37,483
of being scared to come back.

780
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:39,229
I bet she loved that.

781
00:30:39,264 --> 00:30:40,282
Yep.

782
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:42,242
- Heparinized saline in here, please.
- Uh-huh.

783
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,345
There we go.

784
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:46,793
You know, ever since she got sick,

785
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:48,581
I'm scared all the time.

786
00:30:48,616 --> 00:30:50,483
Even if things are fine.

787
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:52,018
Well, I was scared for Richard.

788
00:30:52,053 --> 00:30:53,953
Uh, I did not want him
to lose another person.

789
00:30:53,988 --> 00:30:56,322
You know, the weird thing is,
when I first found out,

790
00:30:56,357 --> 00:30:59,459
my initial thought was,
"Okay, my mom is gonna die.

791
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:01,594
It's just gonna be me and Richard and..."

792
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:04,164
Then I remembered
I actually have a father.

793
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:06,499
Whole time, did not occur to me
once that I had a father.

794
00:31:06,534 --> 00:31:08,301
Same thing happened to me with Thatcher.

795
00:31:08,335 --> 00:31:10,203
I was sitting with him, and I thought,

796
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:12,472
"Oh, I actually have a father.

797
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:15,041
And he's dying, but... I have a father,

798
00:31:15,076 --> 00:31:17,310
and it's not Richard Webber."

799
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:23,183
Well, I think we are prepped
and ready to re-scrub.

800
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:26,653
All right. It's all yours.

801
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:27,841
What? Where are you going?

802
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,823
I have to go spend some time in my lab...

803
00:31:29,857 --> 00:31:32,892
You know, work on my next
groundbreaking thing.

804
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:35,061
I'm taking my name off. We're even.

805
00:31:35,096 --> 00:31:37,297
You just don't want to do
an extremely long surgery

806
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:38,898
you already won an award for.

807
00:31:38,932 --> 00:31:42,035
You don't need to go to the moon twice.

808
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,271
Thank you, doctors.

809
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,106
Dr. Avery and I have this from here.

810
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:03,817
All right. Ready to assess profusion?

811
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:06,252
Please.

812
00:33:08,455 --> 00:33:12,725
I promise, if things get worse,
I will tell you.

813
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,062
I promise I will not keep
any more secrets from you.

814
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:18,731
Thank you.

815
00:33:21,635 --> 00:33:24,861
Oh, we got a good blood flow.

816
00:33:25,306 --> 00:33:29,342
Aww. Thank you, baby.
This was a beautiful gift.

817
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,813
It's true.

818
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:35,148
Well...

819
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:37,317
She didn't even have a tattoo of Texas.

820
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:39,757
It was just the word "Texas."

821
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:40,920
She...

822
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:43,156
She had a picture of it
further down her back.

823
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,326
Classy.

824
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,965
Okay, all right, Bronwyn
wasn't perfect, but I was...

825
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:53,533
Bronwyn.

826
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:55,368
I was in love with her,
and it still hurt.

827
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:56,700
Aww.

828
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:59,439
It... It... It hurt when she dumped me.

829
00:33:59,473 --> 00:34:01,541
She was doing you a favor.

830
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:04,444
Ah, didn't feel like it.

831
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:06,679
Okay, it's time you knew.

832
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:09,482
She wasn't even from Texas.

833
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:11,618
She was from Delaware, I think.

834
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:17,957
I've done that favor a lot.

835
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:21,292
Huh?

836
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:25,064
Do you remember when
I started at the restaurant?

837
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:29,502
I had just walked out
on another job in Kingston.

838
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:32,205
I was dating this waiter there. Logan.

839
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,239
I really liked him.

840
00:34:33,274 --> 00:34:34,540
I mean, he was kind of a stoner,

841
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:37,977
but he was cute and polite

842
00:34:38,012 --> 00:34:40,270
and a good kisser.

843
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:42,515
Dated for months.

844
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:45,919
And then, one day,
we were making out after work,

845
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:48,554
and he said, "I love you."

846
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:50,890
And I felt...

847
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:55,428
I felt the opposite

848
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:57,096
of how that should make you feel.

849
00:34:57,131 --> 00:34:58,496
I felt...

850
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:01,501
like he was wrong.

851
00:35:01,535 --> 00:35:05,538
Like no one should ever
feel that way about me.

852
00:35:05,572 --> 00:35:07,874
I couldn't even look at him.

853
00:35:07,908 --> 00:35:09,943
I just left.

854
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:13,413
I didn't call him. I didn't call work.

855
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:16,449
I just moved to a different part
of town and started a new job,

856
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:19,752
like none of it had ever happened.

857
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:23,856
I did the same thing
to a guy in high school.

858
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:25,091
And then there was Paul.

859
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,827
Now, you left Paul to save your life.

860
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:31,531
It's in my wiring.

861
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:35,468
My mother was a runner.

862
00:35:35,502 --> 00:35:37,537
She still is, apparently.

863
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:39,572
She can't even sit
in the same room as me,

864
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:42,081
even though she says she loves me.

865
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:45,378
And my father...

866
00:35:50,584 --> 00:35:53,219
I always run. It's what I do.

867
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:07,600
I think you've maybe had enough.

868
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:09,969
I don't really care what you think.

869
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,479
Oh, uh...

870
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,315
Yes. Uh...

871
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,116
You came here seeking a teacher.

872
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:29,987
You came here looking for... Yoda.

873
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,989
And I was not your Yoda today.

874
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,062
I can be.

875
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:34,711
In... In fact, I'm an excellent Yoda,

876
00:36:34,745 --> 00:36:36,460
but not today.

877
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:39,129
Uh, I will look into rescheduling.

878
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,965
Uh.

879
00:36:42,026 --> 00:36:43,159
Are you kidding?

880
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:45,536
About which part?

881
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,371
We learned so much.

882
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,773
Leadership skills, communication.

883
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,642
You told an intern to
"move his sorry damn ass

884
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:52,943
before you move it for him

885
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:54,612
in a way that he would not appreciate..."

886
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,947
You have a secret innovative medicine lab

887
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:58,549
and a blue light room and...

888
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,784
And you're always on the move,
rolling with the punches,

889
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,186
solving problems...

890
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,055
And the women! It's all women!

891
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,124
Better than Yoda, you were.

892
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,377
Chief Bailey?

893
00:37:08,412 --> 00:37:10,127
I hear you're looking
for the compliance reports?

894
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,229
You're ruining a moment, Schmitt.

895
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:14,367
Dr. Karev has me do them every month.

896
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,500
- I'm sorry?
- Yeah.

897
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:18,702
And Helm does the agency
and overtime costs,

898
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,738
Parker does the quality
and employee metrics,

899
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:23,807
and Qadri does the vendor contracts...

900
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:36,654
Hey! Your appy turned into
a four-hour ileocecectomy?

901
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:39,823
DeLuca's ileocecectomy.

902
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:41,225
Really? How'd he do?

903
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,760
Oh, it was... was fine.

904
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:44,261
He got a little snippy with me, though.

905
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:45,563
Snippy?

906
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:46,897
Oh, he had a plan,

907
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,366
and he... he wanted
to see it through, and...

908
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:51,201
he was right.

909
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:52,436
Huh.

910
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,837
He's a surgeon, Meredith.

911
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,773
And a good one.

912
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:57,274
He's a good man.

913
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,556
What does that mean, "rare blood"?

914
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:13,090
Does that matter?

915
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,391
Don't you have all kinds
of blood in a bank?

916
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:16,226
Uh, or O-Negative?

917
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,928
Isn't that the universal donor?

918
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:20,731
Gus can only receive blood
of the exact same type he has.

919
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,233
And until we find enough donors,
we can't operate.

920
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:25,302
How long will that take?

921
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:28,138
So far, we've found
four potential donors.

922
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,307
In... Washington?

923
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:31,542
In the world.

924
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,712
Oh, my God.

925
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:38,048
So he's just gonna get sicker?

926
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,116
Well, we're going to do everything we can

927
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,250
to correct his anemia

928
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:41,785
without transfusing him...

929
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,304
We'll find the blood.

930
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:45,135
Dr. Karev...

931
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:47,157
We're not gonna stop until we find it.

932
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:49,293
He didn't want to tell us
what was wrong, but he did,

933
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,596
and now we're not gonna give up
until we fix him, okay?

934
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:54,565
Thank you.

935
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:09,947
- Is that after expenses?
- Yep.

936
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:12,249
And did you see the way
they separated the departments

937
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,951
with the columns?

938
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,419
With the headings?

939
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,256
Oh. That's very nice.

940
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:20,457
He had the interns do all of this?

941
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:22,135
Mm-hmm.

942
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,795
It's ingenious.

943
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,263
Right?

944
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:30,768
Karev did something better than us.

945
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:34,004
And he can never know.

946
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,781
Hey.

947
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:47,384
You saved the case.

948
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:49,353
- You're welcome.
- I wasn't saying thank you.

949
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,854
So, just more name-calling, then?

950
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,723
Owen. I love you.

951
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,324
I call you names because someone has to.

952
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,492
Someone has to tell you the truth.

953
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:57,361
Oh, the truth that I'm an idiot?

954
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,196
That you need help.

955
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,700
That you need to do for yourself
what you just did for Caleb.

956
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,202
You need to find a...
a way to heal enough

957
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,511
to believe that you are worthy

958
00:40:06,546 --> 00:40:09,807
of joy and happiness
and ease in this life.

959
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:11,241
Because you are. But somehow...

960
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:12,509
I'm thinking because of trauma...

961
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,644
I'm thinking because of war

962
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:15,479
and pain and ugliness and PTSD...

963
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,875
somehow, you've come to believe

964
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,248
that you aren't deserving
of those things,

965
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,817
so you keep making
the hardest possible choices!

966
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,152
Y'know, Megan, I'm sorry
we can't all be perfect.

967
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:23,387
We can't all be you and Riggs.

968
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,222
Owen. Shut up. Seriously.

969
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,324
I see a talk therapist once a week,

970
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,693
I see a somatic PTSD specialist
once a week.

971
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:32,362
Riggs and I see
a couples therapist one a week

972
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:34,531
because I want to be as happy as
I can for the life I have left.

973
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:35,675
Don't you?

974
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:37,067
- I've done therapy, Megan.
- Not enough!

975
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,472
Since when are you an authority...

976
00:40:38,506 --> 00:40:41,105
You went to Germany, and you
told Teddy that you loved her,

977
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,240
and then revealed that,
24 hours previously,

978
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,008
you had been in bed with your ex-wife,

979
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,142
so she kicked you out.

980
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:47,945
How do you not go and get a hotel room

981
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:50,914
and try again the next day
and the next day and the next?

982
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,162
How do you go back to the States

983
00:40:52,197 --> 00:40:53,762
and get back in bed with your ex-wife

984
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:57,354
and have a foster baby
and a teenage addict?!

985
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:00,190
Owen, you're not well.

986
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:02,459
Do the work to fix it.

987
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:04,212
<i>In sickness and in health, they say.</i>

988
00:41:04,246 --> 00:41:05,262
Okay?

989
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,133
<i>That sounds so final, so binding.</i>

990
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,056
<i>But it just means you have to be there.</i>

991
00:41:13,562 --> 00:41:16,640
<i>You have to really want to be there.</i>

992
00:41:18,082 --> 00:41:19,810
<i>For whatever's coming.</i>

993
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,245
You definitely should...

994
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:24,548
<i>And we don't know.</i>

995
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,385
<i>It could all pan out the way we want...</i>

996
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,289
<i>...the way it's supposed to b.</i>

997
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,292
- Hey.
- Hey.

998
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,894
We need more ice.

999
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:44,618
You scared the crap out of me
with that text.

1000
00:41:44,653 --> 00:41:46,670
I'm sorry about that.

1001
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,072
Well... She looks fine now.

1002
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,535
She's not.

1003
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:56,513
I've seen her in rough shape
before, but never like this.

1004
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:59,149
I want to help. I don't know how.

1005
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,086
<i>Or it could be so much worse.</i>

1005
00:42:04,305 --> 00:42:10,773

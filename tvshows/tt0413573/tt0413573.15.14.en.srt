1
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:10,285
Pharmaceuticals are designed to mimic

2
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:12,628
the body's natural brain chemicals...

3
00:00:12,663 --> 00:00:14,563
the ones that make you feel good,

4
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:18,074
make you feel better,
make you feel unstoppable.

5
00:00:20,862 --> 00:00:22,261
3-0 tie, please.

6
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,233
How long do you think it'll take

7
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:30,770
before I'm ready to do a 24-hour surgery?

8
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:33,573
I'm not sure that's
a healthy life goal, Qadri.

9
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:36,776
Hey.

10
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:38,115
What's going on?

11
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:40,813
Mer's doing a pancreas-sparing
total duodenectomy

12
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:42,281
in a frozen abdomen.

13
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:44,076
Oh. It got moved from yesterday?

14
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,451
No, she started it yesterday.

15
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:47,353
Five more hours, and she's gonna
break the hospital's record

16
00:00:47,388 --> 00:00:48,641
for the longest surgery.

17
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:50,656
You think it's gonna take
five more hours?

18
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:53,525
Well, I mean, with the adhesions
and the scar tissue,

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,317
it's taking her longer, so, yeah.

20
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:56,484
She can beat the record.

21
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:58,097
- Feel a little better?
- No.

22
00:00:58,132 --> 00:01:00,681
I mean, yeah, she gets awards
and prizes and all that,

23
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:02,800
but I get to be chief, so we're good.

24
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:06,938
They make it in a lab and put
it in a pill for pain relief,

25
00:01:06,974 --> 00:01:09,808
giving you the high
your body creates naturally

26
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:11,676
anytime you're doing something you love.

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,480
Helm.

28
00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:16,015
You want to tap out?

29
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,172
No, thank you.

30
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,269
- DeLuca?
- No, thank you. I'm good.

31
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:24,256
Think he could use a break, though.

32
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:30,162
When I said "breakfast,"

33
00:01:30,197 --> 00:01:32,998
I meant more of a place where we sit,

34
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:36,902
someone takes our order,
there's less... lion jaws.

35
00:01:36,937 --> 00:01:40,694
No. Um... pointed reduction clamp.

36
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:42,754
I let interns assist on hip replacements

37
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:43,921
once they're prepared.

38
00:01:43,956 --> 00:01:46,490
I don't dish out special favors.

39
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:48,191
At work.

40
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:52,128
Neck osteotomy's done.

41
00:01:52,164 --> 00:01:53,396
Now we got to get into the femoral canal.

42
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:54,515
What's the next step?

43
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:57,400
Okay, first, I'll do a ream.

44
00:01:57,436 --> 00:01:59,470
And what would you use?

45
00:01:59,505 --> 00:02:02,372
I think the Christmas Tree Reamer.

46
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,750
Let's do actual breakfast on Thursday.

47
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:14,952
I'll make French toast.

48
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:23,660
Why are you holding toilet paper?

49
00:02:23,696 --> 00:02:25,428
It's the most important camping supply.

50
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:28,498
Oh, God. Why's your face like that?

51
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:29,614
I, uh...

52
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,667
O-Our weekend away is camping?

53
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:34,337
Yeah. Babe, what did
you think Glen Rock was?

54
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:36,373
"Sounds fancy, but I deserve it"?

55
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:37,607
I mean, of all the campsites I went to,

56
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:38,808
yeah, I guess it's the fanciest.

57
00:02:38,843 --> 00:02:39,942
It did have running water.

58
00:02:39,978 --> 00:02:41,444
But no toilet paper, so no...

59
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,612
Toilets.

60
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:44,547
Okay, so, right. Where do we go...

61
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:45,648
I packed a small shovel.

62
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:47,484
And there are these really nice
rocks. They're great.

63
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,820
You just kind of move over them,
kind of, as you...

64
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:52,855
Look, it's camping, babe.

65
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:53,823
We're going camping.

66
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:55,492
Are we, though?

67
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:57,193
Ohh! You're gonna love it!

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,535
This is Tom Koracick?
The one who works here?

69
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,637
I was surprised, too.
But it's, you know...

70
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:10,472
I don't know. It's new, and it's...

71
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:12,542
it's just kind of... amazing.

72
00:03:12,577 --> 00:03:15,344
Look, I definitely
didn't expect to be dating

73
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:18,514
at 30 weeks pregnant,
but he's kind and fun,

74
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,416
and he's kinda wow.

75
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,217
- Huh.
- I know.

76
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:23,745
How about you and Ben,

77
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,688
now that he's back home? Watch out!

78
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:27,924
Slow down! This is a hospital!

79
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,158
Get out! Go, go, go!

80
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:30,259
- Oh, my...
- Go, go, go, go!

81
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,494
Hey, Bailey, pinpoint pupils!

82
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,565
Yeah. Get some Narcan,
a crash cart, and some O2.

83
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,899
I think we got an OD.

84
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:45,140
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

85
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:48,410
I thought you'd be in O.R. 3.

86
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:49,579
I've been busy.

87
00:03:49,614 --> 00:03:52,581
This boy's buddies almost ran me
over in the ambulance bay.

88
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:53,915
Tossed him out of the car.

89
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:55,284
Opioid overdose.

90
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,252
Why? What's going on in O.R. 3?

91
00:03:57,288 --> 00:03:59,284
Grey's been in surgery since yesterday.

92
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,030
Quite a crowd.

93
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,524
Bailey, we got two more.

94
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,259
Two more overdoses?

95
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:06,528
Mm-hmm. Jerry and Paula. Regulars.

96
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:08,197
Always shooting up
in the park down the street.

97
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:09,764
They usually wake up
with one dose of Narcan

98
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,865
and then refuse treatment,

99
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,216
but I've already given them three
doses, and they're not responding.

100
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,637
There's a bad batch
of something out there.

101
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,574
Attention, all units.
We've reached Code Red status.

102
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:20,442
Any available unit, please
report to Meridien Park

103
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,444
for multiple suspected overdose events.

104
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,279
Looks like I'll be
seeing a lot of you today.

105
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,048
Okay, listen up.

106
00:04:27,084 --> 00:04:29,651
This is gonna be
an all-hands-on-deck situation.

107
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,420
Let's page on-call personnel.

108
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:34,054
Let's make sure that we got
all the Narcan from the pharmacy

109
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,556
to reverse the opioids.

110
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:37,891
We need to be prepared
for secondary injuries

111
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:39,293
and side effects.

112
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:41,353
Wait a minute.
Where are all my residents?

113
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:42,830
Uh, they're in Grey's gallery.

114
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,098
I'll make sure they get down here.

115
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:46,667
- Okay.
- What about Hunt?

116
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:48,402
Um, he's, uh...

117
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:52,740
He's saying goodbye to Leo.
Betty's parents are taking him.

118
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:53,807
Oh. Um...

119
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:56,877
I'm sorry to hear about that,
but this is a mass OD.

120
00:04:57,847 --> 00:05:00,414
Yep. Okay. We'll page him.

121
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:05,819
Get your shoe on.

122
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:07,588
Okay. Get your shoe on.

123
00:05:07,624 --> 00:05:09,857
Your mom got this for him.
Do you want to keep it or...

124
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,892
No, no. That's his favorite.

125
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:18,032
We were gonna... We were gonna
watch him grow up.

126
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,599
We were gonna teach him so many things.

127
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:24,538
Well...

128
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:26,874
Listen.

129
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,043
I, um...

130
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,454
I hope you play soccer.

131
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:33,513
I hope you love your life.

132
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:36,616
Wait, wait. Yours makes mine
sound shallow.

133
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:38,351
Yeah. You should probably go again.

134
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:40,054
Yeah. Um...

135
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,655
Listen.

136
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:48,195
I'm always gonna be rooting for you.

137
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:53,667
Okay. Ready?

138
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:55,135
No.

139
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:57,459
But they're good people, Owen,
and they love him.

140
00:05:57,494 --> 00:05:59,005
He will be loved.

141
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:02,809
Hey.

142
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:07,314
Come in.

143
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,922
So, uh... may I?

144
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:17,657
Oh. Uh, sorry.

145
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:18,885
Yeah. Here.

146
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:21,194
Hi!

147
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,395
Ohh!

148
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:24,521
When he gets fussy like that,
he's usually just hungry.

149
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:25,732
- We've raised one before.
- It's okay.

150
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:27,834
Right.

151
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:30,069
E.R. 911. All hands on deck.

152
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:33,673
So, we are, uh...
very grateful to you both.

153
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:35,208
- I have to go.
- Owen...

154
00:06:35,244 --> 00:06:37,577
Listen, it's a massive
incoming trauma. I have to go.

155
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,580
I'll just, um...

156
00:06:42,783 --> 00:06:45,284
Do you want to feed him
while I finish packing him up?

157
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,451
Yeah, that'd be great.

158
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,287
Whoopsie!

159
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:51,457
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Okay, everybody slow down.

160
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:54,460
Speak to your team calmly, get
what they need, and handle it.

161
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:56,595
With this many people,
communication is key.

162
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:57,982
- What do you got?
- He was responding

163
00:06:58,007 --> 00:07:00,865
until about two minutes ago, when
he started hypoventilating again.

164
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,933
Get him on a Narcan drip.

165
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,472
Bailey, how's it going?

166
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:07,204
It's worse outside than it is in here.

167
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,773
And too many teenagers.

168
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:10,808
I'm aware that I sound like my mother,

169
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:12,379
but is the world going to Hell
in a handbasket?

170
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:15,413
Uh, 0.4 of Narcan.

171
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:16,781
All right. Bailey, you got this?

172
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:17,829
I'm gonna go to the ambulance bay

173
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:18,883
and see if I can get it under control.

174
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:19,884
Teddy, I'll do it.

175
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,051
Owen. Look, I'm sorry.

176
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,887
I-I wasn't gonna page you, but...

177
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:24,622
No, no, no. Better here than at home.

178
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:26,056
Okay.

179
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:28,693
Hey.

180
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:30,595
People are dropping like flies
all over the park.

181
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,663
Never seen anything like it.

182
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:32,730
How many ODs have been called in?

183
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,765
50 and counting.

184
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:41,772
Whoa.

185
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,874
Hey, everybody! Listen up!
Here's how this is gonna go.

186
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,709
Three ambulances are gonna pull up.

187
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:03,053
When the patients are offloaded,
they're gonna pull out,

188
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:04,596
and then the next three
are gonna come in.

189
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:07,348
We're gonna set up a triage area,

190
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:09,506
where we're gonna assess each ambulance

191
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,675
and mark them with the appropriate tag.

192
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,444
Red tags get priority for the E.R.

193
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,813
Walking wounded will
be shown to the clinic,

194
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:18,282
where they're gonna be evaluated.

195
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:19,385
Thank you.

196
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,485
Thank you. Let's go.

197
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:25,521
Helm, tell me
about the SMA first approach.

198
00:08:25,556 --> 00:08:26,812
You, uh, dissect out

199
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:29,525
the entire superior mesenteric artery

200
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,595
to, uh, evaluate for any...
tumor invasion.

201
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,096
Helm, are you in pain?

202
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:35,598
No.

203
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:37,132
I, uh...

204
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:39,669
I just, uh, shouldn't have had
so much coffee.

205
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:41,437
- Well, then go.
- No. I can hold it.

206
00:08:41,472 --> 00:08:43,472
If you can, I can.

207
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:46,175
Did she have her bladder stapled?

208
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,376
That's not the hard part...

209
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:49,178
the achy legs, the sore feet,

210
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:50,846
the cramping back, or the bladder.

211
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:52,848
No, the hard part is that
this surgery doesn't get easier

212
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:54,450
as it goes on... it gets harder.

213
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:56,719
And her eyes and her instincts
will need to be sharper

214
00:08:56,754 --> 00:08:59,888
when she finishes than when she started.

215
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:01,222
And that was yesterday.

216
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:02,624
Do you think she's part robot?

217
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:04,659
I can hear you.

218
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:06,361
I'm... so sorry.

219
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:08,162
Helm, just go. Go update the family.

220
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:09,531
Tell them that he's doing great.

221
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:11,366
And then go see
what you can do in the pit.

222
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:13,134
Thank you! Sorry. Thank you!

223
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:19,140
Hey! Dr. Hays wants to know
if he can still do that surgery.

224
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:21,209
Not if it's elective.
I want those O.R.s free.

225
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:22,410
Have you ever seen anything like this?

226
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:23,557
No. And of course it happens on a day

227
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:25,380
that Mer sets a new surgical record.

228
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:26,881
I mean, I want to be there
to cheer her on.

229
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,883
She has DeLuca to cheer her on.

230
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:30,585
Well, that's not a thing.
Pretty sure that's a thing.

231
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,853
Truman! Truman?

232
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:35,155
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- My son... Truman.

233
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,289
He's three years old...

234
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,134
He has blond hair, he's wearing
a blue shirt, I think...

235
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:39,259
All right, we'll call security...

236
00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:40,361
I talked to the police.

237
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:41,928
The police are at the park, looking.

238
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:43,530
We were at the park, playing,

239
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:44,931
and suddenly there were ambulances

240
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,075
and police cars everywhere,

241
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:47,434
and I went to see what was going on,

242
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,102
and then when I turned around...

243
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:50,328
...Truman was gone,

244
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:52,172
and then, uh...

245
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:53,540
Anyway, the police
are looking in the park,

246
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:54,908
and so I thought I would come here

247
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,387
and see if an ambulance person
or a fireman...

248
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:58,080
- W-What's your name?
- Wendy.

249
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:00,337
- Wendy, look, we're gonna help you.
- Jo, can you take her...

250
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:01,593
I'll take her to security,
see if he's here.

251
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:03,584
- Do you have a picture of him?
- Yes. Yes.

252
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:05,252
Okay, I'll make sure she has a tele bed

253
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:07,087
to monitor for arrhythmias.

254
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:08,621
And I'll be out of town this weekend,

255
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:10,089
but I'll have Parker check
for her electrolytes

256
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:11,357
and cardiac markers,

257
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:14,093
and you just, you know, call me
if you see anything unusual.

258
00:10:14,128 --> 00:10:16,796
- All right.
- If calls can even go through.

259
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:18,798
I might be completely off the grid.

260
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,466
You going to the moon?

261
00:10:20,502 --> 00:10:21,768
I'm going camping.

262
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:23,135
Why?

263
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,371
'Cause Jackson loves camping
and I love Jackson.

264
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,440
I love Ben, but I don't love
fantasy basketball.

265
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:28,574
Therefore, I don't participate.

266
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,545
I'm going camping, Bailey,
and I am going to like it.

267
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,679
Are you, though?

268
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:38,984
All right, Qadri,
so, we're definitely looking

269
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,553
at a shooter's abscess.

270
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:42,554
I need to you make sure
he's got plenty of antibiotics

271
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,155
and get a full washout in the O.R.

272
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,330
And look, I know it smells bad,

273
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:47,626
but breathe out of your mouth
or something

274
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:49,694
so you don't look so overtly disgusted.

275
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:53,998
Mr. Frazier's prepped
for his hip replacement,

276
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:56,167
and Schmitt's been crushing
the saw bones sessions,

277
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:57,378
so he'll assist.

278
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:59,070
That's great, but Schmitt's
gonna have to wait.

279
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:01,506
But his technique's flawless,
and I'll be there...

280
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,909
I see the butterflies
floating around between you two,

281
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:05,977
and that's cool, but try
to see past them long enough

282
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:08,246
to notice the flood of patients
around you.

283
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:09,514
I postponed Mr. Frazier's surgery.

284
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,082
It's all hands on deck with trauma.

285
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:13,852
- Got it.
- This unlucky lady not only OD'd,

286
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:16,154
she broke both of her arms when she fell.

287
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:18,956
She needs to go to the O.R.
Schmitt can assist with that.

288
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:20,591
And tell the anesthesiologist

289
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:22,493
she's had four doses of Narcan.

290
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:24,261
Thank you so much, sir.
I won't let you down.

291
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:25,362
I am ready and prepared and...

292
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:27,731
Show me, don't tell me, Schmitt.

293
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:30,768
Interns. Am I right?

294
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:34,271
No offense.

295
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:36,273
None taken.

296
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:37,508
Out of your mouth, please.

297
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:46,717
Apneic at the scene
with erratic rhythms...

298
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:48,218
last BP, 80 over 40.

299
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:50,620
Got one patient responsive
after two doses of Narcan

300
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,322
and another one with decreased mentation

301
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:53,523
but responsive and talking.

302
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,761
He lost his pulse. Starting CPR.

303
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:57,560
Helm, your two sound good
to go to the clinic,

304
00:11:57,596 --> 00:11:58,776
but keep an eye on them.

305
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:00,597
- Yes, sir.
- Let's get them inside. Come on.

306
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:05,635
What's happening?

307
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,970
Is s-she gonna be okay?

308
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:08,305
Get these two into the clinic.

309
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,739
Is she... Betty!

310
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:10,807
Betty!

311
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:14,815
Unh! 5-0.

312
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:16,915
4-0.

313
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,118
- What happened?
- You did it.

314
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:30,143
No, I haven't finished the anastomosis

315
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:31,478
or the lymphadenectomy.

316
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:32,761
Suture scissors, Bokhee.

317
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:33,881
Mered...

318
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,584
Dr. Grey, you just beat
the hospital record

319
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:37,976
for the longest single surgery.

320
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:39,807
Yeah. I guess I did.

321
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:43,657
Damn it.

322
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:44,758
What?

323
00:12:44,794 --> 00:12:46,659
That just means that I'm gonna
want to break it again.

324
00:12:47,842 --> 00:12:50,564
Okay, let's get ready with some lap pads.

325
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,999
And, uh, Bokhee, someone should
update the family.

326
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:56,269
Okay. I'm gonna tell them
their son's being saved

327
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:57,809
by a surgical legend.

328
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,909
Okay, don't do that.

329
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,077
Surgical superhero?

330
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,746
- No.
- Wonder Woman?

331
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,079
Yeah! Perfect.

332
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:05,181
Thank you, Bokhee.

333
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:06,583
Whoo!

334
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,151
You are.

335
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:11,020
Okay, now observe the scaphoid carefully.

336
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:12,855
What's the usual point of entry?

337
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:14,758
The distal pole.

338
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,793
But wait. There's a humpback deformity.

339
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:18,161
Exactly.

340
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,060
Can you imagine...

341
00:13:21,095 --> 00:13:22,932
...wanting something so badly

342
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:25,968
that you'd be willing to
break both your arms to get it?

343
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:27,882
Well, she didn't mean to break her arms.

344
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:28,976
Yeah, I know. I'm just...

345
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:30,626
I broke both my arms once.

346
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:31,712
You did?

347
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:34,143
Couldn't wipe my own butt
all summer. It was the worst.

348
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,946
But the new X-Men comic was coming out,

349
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:38,848
and I had to have it.

350
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:42,285
Like, had to be first in line
because, in my world,

351
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,321
that was the only thing
worth bragging about.

352
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:46,989
Fell off your bike?

353
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:50,326
Flipped over the handlebars...
one block from the store.

354
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:54,030
I got two months in casts,
three months of PT.

355
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:56,966
And Robbie Freaking Krimefelt
got bragging rights.

356
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:58,387
So yeah.

357
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:02,471
I get wanting something so bad
you'd be willing to...

358
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,440
Whoa. You just...

359
00:14:06,443 --> 00:14:07,843
All right.

360
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:09,044
She's all good.

361
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,512
And with no hands to shoot up
for the next three months,

362
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:13,715
hopefully, she'll actually
manage to detox.

363
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:17,252
Dr. Mahoney to the E.R.

364
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:19,387
Dr. Mahoney to the E.R.

365
00:14:19,422 --> 00:14:20,456
Hey.

366
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,656
Tell me she found that kid.

367
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:23,691
No. Security's on it.

368
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:26,094
I'm worried about her.
Her BP's through the roof.

369
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:27,195
She is so scared.

370
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:28,930
Excuse me.

371
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:32,267
I found him in the park...
kind of shook up.

372
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:34,035
Truman!

373
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:35,871
I'm gonna...

374
00:14:35,906 --> 00:14:37,072
Mommy!

375
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:38,273
Thank you.

376
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:39,573
I saw him wandering,

377
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:42,183
and I thought, well,
everybody's coming here.

378
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:44,178
Uh... yeah.

379
00:14:44,213 --> 00:14:46,613
Let... Let us get you some food
and some shoes, maybe.

380
00:14:46,648 --> 00:14:47,726
No. Unh-unh.

381
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,017
No, please. We got to
take a look at those feet.

382
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:51,752
Uh, Qadri, could you help this gentleman?

383
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:52,987
Yeah.

384
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:57,124
So, she's all right, then? That lady?

385
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,126
Oh, yeah. She's...
She's fine, thanks to you.

386
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:00,361
She was scared out of her mind.

387
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:01,929
No, I mean from the park.

388
00:15:01,964 --> 00:15:04,154
I saw her passed out
on the bench out there

389
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:06,267
with the rest of them junkies.

390
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,982
I want to go.

391
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:24,377
Can we go? Can you get our clothes?

392
00:15:24,413 --> 00:15:26,453
Okay, yeah. Sure. I just...
I want to make sure you're okay.

393
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:27,608
I want to go.

394
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:29,122
I don't want Amelia to see me here.

395
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:30,990
I-I don't want to put her
through that again.

396
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:32,426
- O-Okay.
- Linus, please, can we...

397
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:35,328
Hey. Hey!

398
00:15:35,363 --> 00:15:37,163
Hey! Help! I need help!

399
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:38,965
Hey. It's okay.

400
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,099
She was just talking.

401
00:15:40,135 --> 00:15:41,968
She wasn't complaining
of anything when she came in.

402
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:43,236
Well, she's complaining now.

403
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:45,639
- It hurts!
- What did she take? I need to know.

404
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:46,807
Meth.

405
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:48,507
We smoked some meth before
the batch of pills came 'round.

406
00:15:48,543 --> 00:15:49,713
280 over 145.

407
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,009
Okay, I need a gurney!

408
00:15:57,017 --> 00:15:58,183
Out of my way.

409
00:15:58,218 --> 00:15:59,347
Out of my way!

410
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:06,191
I got a hypertensive emergency here.

411
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:07,426
Took meth and opioids

412
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:09,261
and whatever they were laced with.

413
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:10,796
Clear a trauma room now!

414
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:16,485
7-0 tube.

415
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,115
Helm said she was stable when
she landed. This just happened.

416
00:16:19,151 --> 00:16:20,217
What's happening? Is she okay?

417
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:21,352
- Who's that?
- No idea. Boyfriend?

418
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:22,447
Get him out of here. I've got this.

419
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,521
No! I need to be with Betty, all right?

420
00:16:24,557 --> 00:16:26,357
- I love her. I love her. Please.
- Get him out of here!

421
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:28,541
I need to be with her!
She's afraid to be alone!

422
00:16:28,576 --> 00:16:30,394
Dude, let me help you. Let them help her.

423
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:31,517
Go.

424
00:16:31,553 --> 00:16:32,863
- How can I help?
- She needs to be ruled out

425
00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:34,897
of multi-organ damage, hypertensive ICH.

426
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:36,332
I've started her on a clevidipine drip.

427
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:38,033
Hunt, you need to step away.

428
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:39,335
We need that X-ray in here now!

429
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:40,403
Let me do this!

430
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:42,372
Just... call Amelia.

431
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:43,810
Tell her that Betty's back.

432
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:45,675
We don't need her to
flip her car trying to get here.

433
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:49,345
Richard, please.

434
00:16:59,724 --> 00:17:00,757
I need to be with Betty.

435
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:03,192
No, you need hydration,
and we need to observe...

436
00:17:03,227 --> 00:17:04,732
One of the first nights at rehab,

437
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,529
Betty was telling me
what she's scared of.

438
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:09,498
I-I-It was blood,
being home alone in the dark,

439
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:11,266
falling into a frozen lake,

440
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:13,602
a-and she was scared
that for the rest of her life,

441
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:14,836
she'd have to tell people

442
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:18,172
that her dealer got her pregnant at 15.

443
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,775
And who would love her then?

444
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,175
But I did. All right?

445
00:17:21,211 --> 00:17:22,372
And I do.

446
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:24,245
And I told her that one day,
we'd get a house

447
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:26,247
and that we could
keep the lights on all the time

448
00:17:26,283 --> 00:17:27,716
and we'd be nowhere near a lake

449
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:30,351
and that no matter what,
I would love her.

450
00:17:30,387 --> 00:17:32,653
No matter what. You have
to save her... please.

451
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:34,310
Betty's getting the help she needs.

452
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:38,564
I'll... get you an update
as soon as I can.

453
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,366
Okay, Ralph, I've paged a plastic surgeon

454
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:47,268
to come take a look
at these skin lesions.

455
00:17:48,438 --> 00:17:51,138
I don't have any shoes,
but I'm getting plastic surgery.

456
00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:54,374
And I'll need a urine sample.

457
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,543
What for?

458
00:17:55,578 --> 00:17:57,545
We just need to run a tox screen.

459
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,413
Oh, that's unnecessary.

460
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:02,450
I don't do drugs or drink alcohol.

461
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:04,051
I just make my home in the park.

462
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:05,953
I'm not like them.

463
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:08,761
They're bringing down
the neighborhood, you ask me.

464
00:18:10,493 --> 00:18:13,093
Do you have... anywhere else
that you could stay?

465
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:14,278
A temporary shelter?

466
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:16,330
No. They got more people
than they got beds.

467
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:18,732
They set a limit
on how many nights you can stay.

468
00:18:18,768 --> 00:18:20,981
I maxed out months ago.

469
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:24,838
I never thought I'd be
calling a park bench my home,

470
00:18:24,873 --> 00:18:27,974
but rent control went out,
and I went out with it.

471
00:18:30,946 --> 00:18:33,212
- Qadri, what do we have?
- This is Mr. Tennyson.

472
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:35,782
He's got ulcerations and eschars
on the dorsums of his feet.

473
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:39,151
Mr. Tennyson, this is Dr. Avery.
He's our head of plastics.

474
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:41,287
You don't want to give me
a nose job, do you?

475
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,423
No, sir. Your nose is perfect.

476
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:46,882
I would like to take a look
at these feet, though.

477
00:18:49,163 --> 00:18:50,964
Qadri, face.

478
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:57,537
She's got a widened mediastinum,

479
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:59,038
and with the meth and opioids...

480
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:00,706
You're worried
about an aortic dissection.

481
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:01,907
Mm-hmm.

482
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:03,976
It's a known complication of meth.

483
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,443
She's got the classic signs.

484
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:12,184
- Hey. Where is she?
- Amelia...

485
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,886
Well, is she hurt or just high?
Richard said...

486
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:15,787
Listen, I didn't want you to panic,

487
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:18,357
but we received some patients
from Meridien Park,

488
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:19,492
and they all OD'd from the same drug...

489
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:21,527
She OD'd? Is she okay?

490
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:22,628
You brought them here?

491
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,897
They were still at the house.

492
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:26,399
- That's Britney.
- Britney?

493
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:28,684
Oh, my God. What happened?
Is she hurt? I need to see her. Move.

494
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:29,977
You can't go in there. You can't go...

495
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:31,240
Oh, my God. You had to intubate her?

496
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:33,479
- You can't go in there right now...
- That is our daughter!

497
00:19:33,515 --> 00:19:34,640
Yeah, and I'm her doctor, okay? So...

498
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:37,242
Okay, everyone calm down
and let Dr. Altman do her work.

499
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,347
You too, Hunt.

500
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:39,577
Okay, just tell us what happened.

501
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,846
She, uh, complained about chest pain,

502
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,416
and it looks like
she's had an aortic dissection.

503
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:45,917
We're prepping her
for the O.R. right now.

504
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,052
Surgery?

505
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:49,187
We're gonna call Pierce,
we're gonna meet her there.

506
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,089
- I'm gonna do it.
- No, no. You have an entire E.R...

507
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,104
- Bailey can handle it.
- No. I'm gonna call Pierce...

508
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:54,346
We don't have time to wait for Pierce.

509
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:55,534
Owen, let her do it.

510
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,728
Okay.

511
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:58,890
Well, I'm gonna go, too.

512
00:19:58,926 --> 00:20:01,231
Uh, Dr. Hunt, now,
you can help out in the pit,

513
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,067
or you can sit in the chair
with the other parents,

514
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,169
but you will not step one foot
in that O.R.

515
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,071
All right, here we go.

516
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,672
All right. Watch the baby, please.

517
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,836
Here we come.

518
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:11,775
Thank you. Hold the elevator!

519
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,948
I don't understand
why you took him. He was fine.

520
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:23,800
Because he was out of your sight
for a little while,

521
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:25,187
so we just needed to check him out.

522
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:26,457
He'll be back soon.

523
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:29,323
You know, let me... let me
take your blood pressure again.

524
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:30,624
I'm fine!

525
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:31,758
And so is he.

526
00:20:31,794 --> 00:20:33,492
We should just be able to go.

527
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:34,760
Okay.

528
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:37,930
Stuart?

529
00:20:37,965 --> 00:20:39,699
Oh, my God!

530
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:42,601
Honey, they didn't need to call you.

531
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:43,869
We just had a little scare.

532
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:46,457
Wendy, tell me what the hell is going on.

533
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:48,106
I just...

534
00:20:48,142 --> 00:20:50,776
Rita gave me some pills once,
from her back surgery,

535
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:52,167
just... to relax me.

536
00:20:52,203 --> 00:20:54,447
You were in the park to buy drugs?

537
00:20:54,482 --> 00:20:56,595
You took Truman with you to buy drugs?

538
00:20:57,885 --> 00:20:59,848
I couldn't leave him alone in the car.

539
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:04,457
Please, Stuart. I'm sorry.

540
00:21:04,492 --> 00:21:06,826
I love him. I love him.

541
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:09,294
I love him! You have to forgive me!

542
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,630
Can you take me to my son, please?

543
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,698
Please.

544
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,981
It's a lot, right?

545
00:21:30,016 --> 00:21:33,718
This is one of those days
where being a doctor is...

546
00:21:33,754 --> 00:21:36,187
It feels futile.

547
00:21:36,222 --> 00:21:37,423
It's, like, we're in here

548
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,557
doing our damnedest
to save lives, and out there,

549
00:21:39,593 --> 00:21:41,893
people are just
killing themselves or each other

550
00:21:41,928 --> 00:21:44,560
faster than we can possibly work, so...

551
00:21:45,432 --> 00:21:47,031
...what's the point?

552
00:21:51,804 --> 00:21:53,036
Where would you go?

553
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,907
If you just... gave it all up?

554
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,323
Um...

555
00:21:58,911 --> 00:22:01,150
You know, when it all seems hopeless,

556
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,347
what's your secret fantasy escape hatch?

557
00:22:08,421 --> 00:22:09,787
Went to Barbados once.

558
00:22:09,822 --> 00:22:13,524
It was a bunch of expats...
started a Blues bar.

559
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,762
Tiny little shack
but incredible guitar players.

560
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,299
Waves... rum... sand...

561
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:23,500
quiet.

562
00:22:25,663 --> 00:22:26,796
You?

563
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,981
Right now, that sounds...

564
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:32,975
pretty great, actually.

565
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,280
What the...

566
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,416
What's...

567
00:22:41,853 --> 00:22:43,886
- Oh, my God. Son of a bitch!
- Oh, my God.

568
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:45,120
Oh, my God, no.

569
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,422
Here.

570
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,990
Got to get down here.

571
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:55,932
I came as soon as I heard...

572
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:57,099
Type B dissection?

573
00:22:57,134 --> 00:23:00,068
I'm gonna do an endovascular
stent of the descending aorta.

574
00:23:00,103 --> 00:23:01,235
Webber's on his way up to join.

575
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:03,472
Thank you. I know you've been
swamped down in the pit.

576
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,776
I can take it from here.

577
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:06,808
- No.
- No?

578
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,344
She's so pale, I can see
every capillary under her skin.

579
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:12,397
That dissection could
cause her aorta to rupture.

580
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,150
You know as well I do
that Amelia may never see

581
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,419
that little girl open her eyes again.

582
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:20,288
- Teddy...
- And if that happens,

583
00:23:20,323 --> 00:23:22,791
let me be the surgeon
to tell Amelia that we lost her.

584
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:25,026
Because she's gonna need her sister.

585
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:42,273
You are so close.

586
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:44,337
Tell me something.

587
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:46,423
Okay. What?

588
00:23:46,448 --> 00:23:47,684
Just anything.

589
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,198
Because all I can think about right now

590
00:23:49,223 --> 00:23:50,757
is how much my feet and my legs hurt,

591
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:53,092
so if you tell me something,
I can think about that instead.

592
00:23:53,128 --> 00:23:55,028
Um, okay.

593
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:58,698
Uh, when I was seven years old,
I broke a world record.

594
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:01,567
For what?

595
00:24:01,602 --> 00:24:04,436
Most times a minor rode
a roller coaster in one day.

596
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:07,140
Really? How many times did you ride it?

597
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:08,240
12.

598
00:24:09,744 --> 00:24:11,900
I-I didn't really break a world record,

599
00:24:11,936 --> 00:24:13,632
but for several years,
I believed that I did.

600
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:23,755
You're an artist.

601
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,091
And I think it didn't occur to me

602
00:24:26,126 --> 00:24:28,093
because you're also a work of art.

603
00:24:29,597 --> 00:24:30,929
Physically.

604
00:24:30,964 --> 00:24:33,465
Like a statue in Rome.

605
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:35,934
And when I look at you,

606
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:38,609
surgery isn't what springs to mind.

607
00:24:39,307 --> 00:24:40,785
But that...

608
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:43,739
...in there...

609
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:48,146
I want to be that good.

610
00:24:50,117 --> 00:24:51,371
You'll get there.

611
00:24:52,453 --> 00:24:55,287
And you're also good at a lot of things.

612
00:24:57,957 --> 00:25:00,325
So much better than a comic book.

613
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,206
Couldn't get him back.

614
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:16,641
He was my patient.

615
00:25:16,676 --> 00:25:19,444
I left him sitting in a bed
with an IV in his arm.

616
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:21,479
Perfectly healthy kid.

617
00:25:25,585 --> 00:25:26,651
Dr. Shepherd?

618
00:25:28,355 --> 00:25:29,520
Are you okay?

619
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:35,225
Do you want to take a break, take a walk?

620
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:36,792
I knew him.

621
00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:39,127
That kid.

622
00:25:39,931 --> 00:25:41,131
He was, uh...

623
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:44,675
He was a good kid.

624
00:25:45,237 --> 00:25:46,721
He wasn't a bad kid.

625
00:25:50,743 --> 00:25:52,309
I'm gonna have to call his parents.

626
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,079
I can take care of that.

627
00:25:56,114 --> 00:25:57,180
No.

628
00:25:58,384 --> 00:25:59,716
No, I'm...

629
00:26:00,971 --> 00:26:02,238
Thank you.

630
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,201
I'm so sorry.

631
00:26:19,236 --> 00:26:20,869
It's... It's okay.

632
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:22,338
I'm so sorry.

633
00:26:30,315 --> 00:26:32,047
Great work, Qadri.

634
00:26:32,082 --> 00:26:35,351
You want to cut away all that dead tissue

635
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,453
till we find healthy bleeding.

636
00:26:37,488 --> 00:26:38,454
Almost done.

637
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:39,588
So I get to keep 'em?

638
00:26:39,624 --> 00:26:41,189
You do get to keep them.

639
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,237
Can I talk to you?

640
00:26:47,631 --> 00:26:48,797
Yeah, of course.

641
00:26:50,134 --> 00:26:51,599
I can't go camping this weekend.

642
00:26:51,635 --> 00:26:53,202
Babe, see, the thing is you think

643
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,402
you can't go camping this weekend, okay?

644
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:55,704
But once we get out there,

645
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,039
you're gonna find it breathtaking.

646
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:59,875
And you will realize all the
things we don't need in life...

647
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,443
just how much we don't need, okay?

648
00:27:01,478 --> 00:27:03,478
When you're sitting there
by a fire crackling,

649
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:05,413
one bowl, one spoon, you realize

650
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,582
we don't need...
three pairs of ski boots.

651
00:27:07,617 --> 00:27:08,954
- You know?
- Y... No.

652
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,630
And don't... don't tell me
that you don't ski.

653
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,541
I know you don't ski,
because it's outdoors,

654
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:14,222
but that's probably because your parents

655
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,457
didn't take you outdoors,
but when I do, you will see.

656
00:27:16,492 --> 00:27:19,227
Okay? Just let me show you, please? Okay?

657
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,494
Okay. Backing up...

658
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:21,545
Mm-hmm.

659
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,231
Betty is in the hospital.

660
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,765
She OD'd.

661
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,101
Amelia's gonna need help, so...

662
00:27:27,136 --> 00:27:29,503
So you cannot go camping this weekend.

663
00:27:29,538 --> 00:27:30,614
My bad.

664
00:27:31,174 --> 00:27:32,449
I'm sorry.

665
00:27:32,876 --> 00:27:34,775
You should still go, though.

666
00:27:36,846 --> 00:27:38,946
Aw. That's too bad.

667
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:41,875
Ah, it's okay.

668
00:27:42,551 --> 00:27:44,252
Next time.

669
00:27:45,453 --> 00:27:49,021
Okay, so, we're almost finished here.

670
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:50,416
I'll get you bandaged up.

671
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:52,860
It's important that you keep
this clean and dry, okay?

672
00:27:52,895 --> 00:27:54,239
That'll be tricky.

673
00:27:54,275 --> 00:27:55,863
Ralph lives in the park.

674
00:27:55,898 --> 00:27:57,964
He brought in a little missing boy today.

675
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,500
Oh.

676
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:03,437
The park. Okay, I hadn't...
realized that.

677
00:28:03,472 --> 00:28:05,272
It's okay.

678
00:28:05,307 --> 00:28:07,808
Makes you realize
all the things you don't need.

679
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:12,479
Dr. Teller to the E.R.

680
00:28:12,515 --> 00:28:15,348
Dr. Teller to the E.R.

681
00:28:15,384 --> 00:28:16,483
Mr. Cole.

682
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:19,219
The police have taken your wife
into custody and...

683
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:21,081
Good. The police can have her.

684
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:25,191
Sir, your wife has a problem.
She needs treatment.

685
00:28:25,227 --> 00:28:26,492
She needs that more than punishment.

686
00:28:26,528 --> 00:28:28,028
I don't know what I can do for her.

687
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:30,030
No, you're right. Don't worry about her.

688
00:28:30,065 --> 00:28:31,231
Worry about him.

689
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:34,034
And no matter what she says,
you don't just forgive her.

690
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:36,536
You don't let her near him
until you know she's clean.

691
00:28:36,571 --> 00:28:39,372
Yes, get her treatment,
but protect your kid.

692
00:28:39,408 --> 00:28:41,141
You got me?

693
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:42,742
Protect your kid.

694
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:50,817
Okay, let's shoot the angio.

695
00:28:50,852 --> 00:28:54,387
No endoleaks, stent-grafts
are well-approximated.

696
00:28:54,423 --> 00:28:56,155
Aortic arch is clear.

697
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,423
There's no flow from the celiac.

698
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,224
Let's shoot from the femoral.

699
00:29:00,294 --> 00:29:01,927
Dye.

700
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:09,868
Higher concentration of dye.

701
00:29:09,903 --> 00:29:12,271
God, I hate that she did this to herself.

702
00:29:12,306 --> 00:29:14,106
That's addiction...
the thing that's killing you

703
00:29:14,141 --> 00:29:17,262
keeps whispering in your ear
that you need it to survive.

704
00:29:18,745 --> 00:29:20,211
There's no flow from either end.

705
00:29:20,246 --> 00:29:22,280
Her distal aorta is blocked.

706
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:23,915
Which means there's no blood flow

707
00:29:23,951 --> 00:29:25,283
to the distal extremities.

708
00:29:25,318 --> 00:29:26,409
Damn it! Damn it!

709
00:29:26,444 --> 00:29:28,119
Altman, if there's
any extraordinary measures

710
00:29:28,154 --> 00:29:31,222
you can use here, please use them now.

711
00:29:31,257 --> 00:29:32,457
Okay. Take everything out.

712
00:29:32,493 --> 00:29:34,025
We're gonna have to open her up

713
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,361
and reconstruct
her distal aorta completely

714
00:29:36,396 --> 00:29:37,562
if we're gonna save her life.

715
00:29:37,598 --> 00:29:38,630
Let me have a pad.

716
00:29:38,665 --> 00:29:40,565
All right, let's prep her abdomen!

717
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:41,967
Let's go. Come on.

718
00:29:42,002 --> 00:29:43,535
Come on, Betty. Come on.

719
00:29:50,843 --> 00:29:53,110
I can't even stand to look at you.

720
00:29:55,434 --> 00:29:58,303
That's the last thing I said
to her before she disappeared.

721
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:04,087
"I can't even stand to look at you."

722
00:30:08,961 --> 00:30:10,260
Now...

723
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:17,601
Tell us that she's gonna be okay.

724
00:30:19,304 --> 00:30:21,038
I mean, you're doctors. Just...

725
00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:25,205
...tell us that she's gonna
get through this.

726
00:30:26,878 --> 00:30:28,378
I wish I could.

727
00:30:30,615 --> 00:30:33,050
I wish I could tell you that.

728
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:48,357
DeLuca, you'll place the wound vac.

729
00:30:48,392 --> 00:30:49,447
Okay.

730
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:52,082
Final time... 27 hours and 8 minutes.

731
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:56,053
That beats the hospital's
old record by over three hours.

732
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,221
Whoo!

733
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,791
Thank you for the assist, Dr. DeLuca.

734
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:13,737
I am going to go put my feet
in medical waste,

735
00:31:13,773 --> 00:31:15,508
so I definitely need a ride home.

736
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:17,340
Amelia needs us.

737
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,975
It's Betty.

738
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,711
She's gonna need us.

739
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:40,125
Mr. and Mrs. Dickinson?

740
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:41,698
She's out of surgery.

741
00:31:42,022 --> 00:31:43,354
She's being moved up to the ICU.

742
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,214
Oh, thank God.

743
00:32:10,249 --> 00:32:13,518
That means... she made it, right?

744
00:32:13,553 --> 00:32:15,252
Yeah.

745
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:17,187
I think that's what that means.

746
00:32:37,484 --> 00:32:38,708
Come here.

747
00:32:41,813 --> 00:32:44,914
This world is so scary.

748
00:32:44,949 --> 00:32:47,284
No matter how well you raise your kids,

749
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,452
no matter how much give them,

750
00:32:49,488 --> 00:32:52,060
it's a scary, scary world.

751
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:53,923
Yeah.

752
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:55,105
It is.

753
00:32:55,894 --> 00:32:57,175
- But it's beautiful, too.
- Mm.

754
00:32:57,211 --> 00:33:00,283
And if you descend into the fear
and miss the beauty,

755
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:03,032
that's when you start to go
to a bad place

756
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:06,102
and need to... escape.

757
00:33:07,471 --> 00:33:09,205
I'm not gonna start using drugs.

758
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,473
Yeah, I know.

759
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:14,143
But... just...

760
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:17,146
be in the beauty with me for a second.

761
00:33:32,263 --> 00:33:35,231
And you don't have room
for one... just one more?

762
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:37,633
He's a 75-year-old m...

763
00:33:37,668 --> 00:33:38,967
His f...

764
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:41,470
Mm-hmm.

765
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:44,852
Y... Yeah. I...

766
00:33:44,877 --> 00:33:46,281
No, I understand.

767
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:48,564
Thank you.

768
00:33:49,647 --> 00:33:50,800
No luck?

769
00:33:50,836 --> 00:33:52,147
It should not be this difficult

770
00:33:52,182 --> 00:33:53,461
to find a place to stay
for an elderly man.

771
00:33:53,497 --> 00:33:55,651
No, it shouldn't.

772
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,286
I feel awful.

773
00:33:58,322 --> 00:34:00,121
I mean, I was going on and on
about how we can't decide

774
00:34:00,157 --> 00:34:01,757
whether we should stay inside or outside,

775
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:03,743
- and I've got too many...
- Ski boots.

776
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:04,926
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

777
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:07,929
And I spent all day debriding his feet,

778
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:09,998
and there's no way he can
maintain a follow-up protocol

779
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:11,053
on a park bench.

780
00:34:12,236 --> 00:34:14,469
I would say just cook his chart
and keep him another night,

781
00:34:14,504 --> 00:34:16,637
but then where is he gonna go
tomorrow night?

782
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:26,281
Owen took Leo to daycare

783
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:28,406
so that you could focus on Britney.

784
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:32,387
So, how are we gonna tell her?

785
00:34:32,422 --> 00:34:33,840
About her... boyfriend?

786
00:34:33,876 --> 00:34:35,222
How are we gonna tell her?

787
00:34:35,258 --> 00:34:36,858
We don't tell her.

788
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,394
What?

789
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:40,528
No.

790
00:34:40,563 --> 00:34:42,363
We don't tell her.

791
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,532
I'm afraid something like that,
that would kill her.

792
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:47,200
That kind of... news could...

793
00:34:47,582 --> 00:34:48,982
it could kill her.

794
00:34:52,153 --> 00:34:54,287
My fiancé died.

795
00:34:54,312 --> 00:34:56,893
Um... years ago.

796
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,772
He died in bed beside me.

797
00:35:00,215 --> 00:35:01,606
He OD'd.

798
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:04,275
I thought it would kill me, too.

799
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,679
But instead, it saved my life.

800
00:35:09,618 --> 00:35:11,618
Because I decided to live.

801
00:35:13,648 --> 00:35:15,948
I decided to live because he died.

802
00:35:19,027 --> 00:35:21,292
You can't protect her from this.

803
00:35:22,149 --> 00:35:24,049
You can't protect her from the pain

804
00:35:24,074 --> 00:35:25,874
that she is going to feel.

805
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:29,384
But you can hope...

806
00:35:30,244 --> 00:35:32,053
that this is her bottom.

807
00:35:33,113 --> 00:35:34,305
I...

808
00:35:35,115 --> 00:35:37,750
God, I hope this is her bottom.

809
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:41,186
I hope this gets her clean.

810
00:35:45,426 --> 00:35:47,125
I hope that she decides to live.

811
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:56,077
Please decide to live.

812
00:35:56,929 --> 00:35:59,430
Honey, please decide to live.

813
00:36:07,743 --> 00:36:09,075
Are you sure?

814
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,933
Yeah. Yeah, whatever you want.

815
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,958
It's not much, but it's enough
to keep you warm and dry

816
00:36:12,983 --> 00:36:15,216
till you get off the waitlist
for a real place.

817
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:18,389
Dry socks here, long underwear,
lightweight tent,

818
00:36:18,424 --> 00:36:20,512
a sleeping bag, a couple raincoats,

819
00:36:20,547 --> 00:36:21,826
and a pair of shoes for you

820
00:36:21,862 --> 00:36:23,260
once the swelling goes down a bit.

821
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:27,231
You had all this...
just in the trunk of your car?

822
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,801
Yeah.

823
00:36:31,844 --> 00:36:33,344
Yeah, I did.

824
00:36:45,357 --> 00:36:48,157
You were left in a park, right?

825
00:36:48,182 --> 00:36:49,881
When you were three.

826
00:36:50,153 --> 00:36:51,819
By your junkie dad.

827
00:36:53,785 --> 00:36:55,285
Bar parking lot.

828
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,443
And I was six.

829
00:36:58,056 --> 00:36:59,629
I wish I'd been three.

830
00:36:59,664 --> 00:37:03,366
Then I wouldn't have remembered
that he left me there.

831
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,592
Jo, it's too late for coffee.

832
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:11,819
It's hot chocolate.

833
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:14,284
I am not a kid anymore.

834
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:15,308
Oh.

835
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,032
I am the chief.

836
00:37:23,152 --> 00:37:25,018
Mmm. Yeah, that's good.

837
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,775
It's really good.

838
00:37:28,386 --> 00:37:29,652
I love you.

839
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:32,695
I love you.

840
00:37:34,331 --> 00:37:36,866
They call it a high for a reason.

841
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:41,637
Because the flip side is really low.

842
00:38:08,131 --> 00:38:09,430
Mom?

843
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:11,032
I'm here.

844
00:38:12,536 --> 00:38:14,201
I'm here.

845
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,588
The chemical version
isn't worth what comes after.

846
00:38:30,587 --> 00:38:33,554
But the dopamine rush
from a job well done?

847
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,223
That's free.

848
00:39:16,793 --> 00:39:20,029
And it's one of the very best
parts of being alive.

- It's not like I wanted this to happen.
- Jo, you have to talk to him.

163
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:12,041
I know.

164
00:06:13,943 --> 00:06:16,495
The boy's in C.T. 2.

165
00:06:16,496 --> 00:06:17,846
ALEX:
Come on, come on, come on.

166
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:19,698
Got your labs.
What are we dealing with?

167
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,468
- Newborn twins.
- Don't talk to DeLuca. He hates kids.

168
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,636
- What do you have against kids?
- I don't hate kids.

169
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:26,606
- Scans up yet?
- No, they're coming.

170
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:28,374
- DeLuca hates kids.
- Hurry up.

171
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,392
- Could be wrong.
- We could be wrong.

172
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:31,810
About what?

173
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:33,746
(Beeping)

174
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:38,917
(Sighs)

175
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:42,071
Um... Pull up the little girl's now.

176
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:44,923
(Alex sighs)

177
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:48,577
For the record, I don't hate kids.

178
00:06:48,578 --> 00:06:49,962
DeLuca, just shut your stupid mouth.

179
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:51,919
(Raps table)
Damn it.

180
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:54,400
(Sighs)
Damn it.

181
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:57,219
Can you tell me what just happened?

182
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,556
- (Sighs) You see that?
- Uh-huh.

183
00:07:00,557 --> 00:07:02,508
The boy has a tumor on his liver.

184
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,393
So does the girl... same tumor.

185
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:07,179
Both invading the kidneys, both
causing early heart failure.

186
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,765
What happened is they have to go
tell a mother and a father

187
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:13,235
that both of their
newborn babies are dying.

188
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:25,830
Sync & corrections by Elderfel

189
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,699
Both of them?

190
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,067
They're just babies.

191
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:34,486
This has to be some kind of mistake.

192
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,955
They can't have cancer.
You can't be born with cancer.

193
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,492
Hepatoblastoma is
a common liver cancer in kids.

194
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,460
It's also very aggressive.

195
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,462
The tumors are
already causing problems

196
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,380
for your kids' kidneys,
hearts, and lungs.

197
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,966
That's why I'm recommending
liver transplants.

198
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,301
Oh, God.

199
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,969
We asked not to see the ultrasound.

200
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,505
We didn't want to know the sex.
We wanted to be surprised.

201
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,007
- Did... did we...
- No, no.

202
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,475
Laurie, this is not your fault.

203
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,810
ALEX: Your O.B. likely
wouldn't have caught it.

204
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,429
It's okay. It's okay.

205
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,347
Uh, just...

206
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,683
What do we do now?
(Clears throat)

207
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,018
The next step is that we get them

208
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,687
on the universal donor list,
and we try to find them donors.

209
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,822
What about us?
C-can we be donors?

210
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,825
Absolutely. We'll test you
to see if you're a match.

211
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,027
- Yes, right now.
- We want to.

212
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:16,028
(Cellphone vibrates, chimes)

213
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,529
Warren, DeLuca, make that happen,

214
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,699
and I'll see you down in the pit.

215
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,584
You should know that
they are in very good hands.

216
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,920
Dr. Karev is amazing.

217
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,621
(Elevator bell dings)

218
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:27,833
Hey.

219
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,208
Hey.

220
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:34,596
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

221
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,387
Do you want to have kids?

222
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:46,441
I... I don't, uh... know.

223
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,393
Uh, yeah.

224
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,730
I-I, uh, do you... now?

225
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,731
Or ever?

226
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,400
I don't know, just is it
something that you want?

227
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,236
Yeah, now... or ever.

228
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,574
God, Alex, it's... it's a simple
yes-or-no question.

229
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,208
What the hell is going on?

230
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,126
- (Elevator bell dings)
- Nothing.

231
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,746
I just...

232
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:09,164
Nothing.

233
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,086
- Hey.
- Hey.

234
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,137
You're a department head.

235
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,806
Will you take a look
at this contract for me

236
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,507
and tell me if anything
looks weird to you.

237
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:21,509
Sure.

238
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,194
(Sighs)
Okay.

239
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:27,732
There it is... the face.

240
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,601
What face?

241
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,237
Maggie made a face,
and now you're making a face.

242
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,707
What is it about my contract that
makes people make that face?

243
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,258
You know what, I... (chuckles)

244
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,545
I don't like talking money
with friends.

245
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,013
We're not talking money, Callie.

246
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,550
- Are we talking money?
- (Sighs)

247
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,968
I think they lowballed you a little.

248
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:48,302
(Clears throat)
A lot.

249
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:50,605
- Why do you think that?
- (Sighs)

250
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,307
Because I make a lot more than you.

251
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:55,643
Yeah, like a lot more than you.

252
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:58,112
Like... like (chuckles) a lot more.

253
00:09:58,113 --> 00:10:00,398
- Well, how much?
- Meredith.

254
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,034
Give me a number.

255
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:06,204
(Elevator bell dings)

256
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,707
I just think, like, can't you
just be civil and rational?

257
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,576
But she won't listen
to anything I have to say.

258
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,211
Now she's decided
that this is the hill

259
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,328
that she's got to die on.

260
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:16,380
Of course that hill
is my living room, so...

261
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,666
Yeah, look, um, yeah, I'm...
I'm with Robbins today,

262
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,885
and Karev has these twins,
so I need...

263
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,220
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, no, go.

264
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,671
- Okay.
- Yeah.

265
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,594
(Sighs)
Hey, look.

266
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,597
uh... if, you know...
if you need to get out of there

267
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,098
or need a couch to crash on...

268
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:35,683
Oh, no, no. Not a chance.

269
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:37,268
Thanks, but no. She's out tonight.

270
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,071
'Cause I mean, if I leave, she wins.

271
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,907
You know, she does not win
my living room.

272
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,408
See?

273
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:46,277
I mean, that's not civil, right?

274
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,945
(Sighs)

275
00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:50,331
Little girl's going into renal failure.

276
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:52,617
Boy's lungs are crapping out fast.

277
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,119
Maybe we'll get lucky
and the parents will be a match.

278
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:00,125
Jo hit me up
about having kids today

279
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,626
out of absolutely nowhere.

280
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:02,793
Is that what happens?

281
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:04,629
You shack up, and then suddenly

282
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,514
your ovaries go into overdrive?

283
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:08,432
Aw, I think you'll be a good dad.

284
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:11,185
Your babies will be so
foul-mouthed and dirty and cute.

285
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:14,188
I just didn't think
we were there yet.

286
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:16,640
I don't know if I am.

287
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:18,475
Definitely didn't think she was.

288
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:21,111
(Gasps)
Alex.

289
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:22,696
- What?
- What if you're already there?

290
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:26,985
W-what if she's asking
'cause she's already knocked up,

291
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,702
and she's just testing the waters?

292
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:30,822
Why would you even say that?

293
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,991
We tested the parents.
The results are back.

294
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:36,661
Mason, you are a match
to do a directed donation.

295
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,712
- Thank God.
- Okay.

296
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:41,548
(Both chuckle)

297
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:43,550
That's good, right?

298
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:46,303
Why don't you look like
that's good news?

299
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:48,755
Um, Laurie...

300
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:51,141
I'm afraid that you're not
a viable candidate.

301
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:52,976
Uh, we still have one.

302
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,995
- I'll split it.
- I'm afraid we can't.

303
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:57,114
The lobe of your liver
that we have to take is...

304
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:58,750
We'll need two donors.

305
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,984
Wait.

306
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:03,120
What happens if we don't find one?

307
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:04,689
One of the babies dies?

308
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,140
We're talking to UNOS,
and we're hoping...

309
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:09,026
I don't want to hope.

310
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:11,745
I want to know that I won't have
to choose between my babies.

311
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:13,658
- Laurie, shh, it's okay.
- It's not okay.

312
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:14,831
Don't tell me that it's okay.

313
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:16,350
At least there's something
that you can do.

314
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:17,818
It's not your fault.
Look, we have one.

315
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,286
Let's just be grateful
that we have one.

316
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:21,338
I know it's not <i>my</i> fault.

317
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:23,273
You wanted to be surprised.

318
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:24,508
You didn't want to know the sex.

319
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:26,009
Okay, they said it wouldn't have
made a difference...

320
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,612
Well, maybe it would have!

321
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:30,597
Maybe there was something
that I could have done and...

322
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:34,385
I am their mother,
and I can't do anything to help them.

323
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,119
Stop yelling at me for being able to.

324
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,122
- It's not my fault.
- Well, then, you decide, Mason.

325
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:41,058
You tell these doctors which one
of our children has to die because...

326
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:42,292
You're not deciding. <i>I</i> am.

327
00:12:44,862 --> 00:12:46,863
You can't make a decision like this.

328
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:49,166
You shouldn't have to.
That's why I'm here.

329
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,817
I'll evaluate, I decide.

330
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:53,236
The baby that I see is stronger,
is doing better,

331
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:55,805
has the better chance to thrive
will get the donation.

332
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:57,057
And the other one?

333
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:02,513
Will get the next one.

334
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:06,182
And we will do everything
that we can to find it.

335
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:10,070
And the rest you put on me.

336
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,265
CALLIE:
Bailey?

337
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:26,465
Uh, Bailey did you like this?

338
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:28,667
I mean, who knew Bailey was the man?

339
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:29,969
Mm, you know what?
They lowballed you

340
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,320
'cause you're an in-house hire.

341
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:33,906
- They knew you wouldn't push back.
- I thought the offer was fair.

342
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:35,708
I mean, for me,
it wasn't about the money.

343
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:38,043
Bailey said she needed me.
The job just fell in my lap.

344
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:40,112
(All groan)
Unh-unh.

345
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:42,715
No, you <i>earned</i> that job, okay?

346
00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:45,417
You need to go back and renegotiate.

347
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:46,719
Hmm?

348
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,122
I can't. It's too late.
I already accepted the offer.

349
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:51,223
No, walk in there
and demand what you deserve.

350
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:52,374
Men do it all the time.

351
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,326
They walk in,
they adjust their man parts,

352
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:55,327
they get more money.

353
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:57,196
Mm-hmm. Yeah, we all did it.

354
00:13:57,197 --> 00:13:58,998
I did it real good.
I mean, I got...

355
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,149
(Chuckles)
I make a lot more than you.

356
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,367
I know. You said that!

357
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:06,572
Okay, so, I mean, what's
the worst they can say? No?

358
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:08,641
I mean, I'd just go back
to my old job.

359
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:10,109
- Ugh.
- Ay, no.

360
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,143
You can't go back.

361
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:12,746
You'd have to move
to another hospital.

362
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:14,213
Maybe another state.

363
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:16,082
(Laughs)

364
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,667
Maggie, what do you think?

365
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:21,587
Uh, don't ask me.

366
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:23,790
I make terrible choices.
I can't be trusted.

367
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,474
I could be having sex right now.

368
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:29,561
- What?
- Six months of my life dating that man.

369
00:14:29,562 --> 00:14:31,330
Six months...
that is an investment.

370
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:32,731
- What?
- He was nice.

371
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:34,049
- Ethan.
- Oh.

372
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,701
He was funny, he was cute,
he was sexy.

373
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:38,303
- He was sexy, right?
- Mm, very.

374
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:39,738
- He was.
- Sweet ass.

375
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:42,524
- No idea.
- Empirically sexy.

376
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:46,078
And the sex... I mean...
(Sighs)

377
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,983
First prize in the talent competition

378
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:52,552
and the long jump,
if you know what I'm saying.

379
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:54,119
- (Laughs)
- Mm-hmm.

380
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,822
But, you know, he... he spit
just a little bit when he talked,

381
00:14:56,823 --> 00:14:59,658
and he said "all-timers"
instead of Alzheimer's.

382
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:01,410
- Uh-oh.
- And I got bored.

383
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:03,812
And I slid away.
I let it fizzle out.

384
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:06,131
And then within another six months,

385
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:07,733
he finds someone else

386
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:10,470
he's ready to spend
the rest of his life with?

387
00:15:10,471 --> 00:15:12,070
I get that. That can happen.

388
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:15,056
I make terrible choices.

389
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:19,111
I leave things behind
and just let the bridges burn.

390
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:21,530
I did it with Ethan.
I did it with Dean.

391
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:24,483
Oh, my God.

392
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:27,419
I did it with my entire life.

393
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:30,755
One day, I chose to learn

394
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:32,124
a little bit about my birth mother.

395
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,259
Cut to I live in her house
with her daughter,

396
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,162
and I work with the kind
stranger who fathered me,

397
00:15:37,163 --> 00:15:41,600
and I left behind an entire life
and family that no longer exists.

398
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:43,468
My parents are divorced.

399
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:45,403
My childhood home is sold.

400
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:48,974
My mother is
in Hawaii making soups now.

401
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:50,775
I... I have no home.

402
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:52,594
It's like I-I flew to this planet

403
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:54,413
on an exploratory mission,

404
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:58,116
and the Earth blew up behind me

405
00:15:58,117 --> 00:16:00,318
and I can't go back.

406
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:03,455
And now I'm here with you aliens.

407
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:07,225
Except I'm the alien,
and I'm all alone,

408
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:09,494
and I have nothing,
and no one wants me.

409
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:11,629
That...

410
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,164
(Clears throat)

411
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:15,083
You got us. We want you.

412
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:16,969
I can't have sex with you.

413
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,286
- No.
- (Sobs)

414
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:20,371
You're a Cylon.

415
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:21,439
(Whimpers)

416
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,408
This is "Galactica."

417
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:26,344
I really do like her.

418
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:28,112
She make me not the crazy sister.

419
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,464
What do you think they're paying her?

420
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:30,965
(Laughter)

421
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:32,851
♪

422
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:43,127
Why are you doing that?

423
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,914
Because people eat dinner.

424
00:16:45,915 --> 00:16:47,433
Not people who are moving out.

425
00:16:47,434 --> 00:16:49,250
April, you're supposed to be packing.

426
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:52,471
I'm not leaving because
I told you I'm not giving up.

427
00:16:52,472 --> 00:16:54,706
If you want to trade nights
on the couch, we can do that.

428
00:16:54,707 --> 00:16:56,208
But I'm not moving out of my home.

429
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:58,159
It's my home. It's my...

430
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,612
Oh, I hate that you are forcing
me to say this stuff.

431
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:03,114
April, okay,
it's my name on the lease.

432
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:05,466
It's my place.
You moved in, and you moved out.

433
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:07,418
No, I didn't move out.

434
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:09,854
I went away, and then I came back.

435
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:10,988
And I am sorry.

436
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:14,275
I am truly sorry
that I wasn't here for you,

437
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:16,077
but I thought if we had some space...

438
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,261
I need space now!

439
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,932
You see?

440
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:21,999
Right now, I really just wanted

441
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,369
to have my burrito and go to sleep.

442
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,204
Save it. I made dinner.

443
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:27,905
What is it... boiled bunny?

444
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:29,341
'Cause you sound crazy.

445
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:31,993
Okay, I feel like a hostage.

446
00:17:31,994 --> 00:17:33,761
But like a reverse hostage
where the kidnapper

447
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,781
just follows me everywhere
and won't leave my damn house.

448
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:37,298
You know what they call that?

449
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:38,649
Marriage.

450
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,952
And it gets hard,
but you don't just leave.

451
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:43,187
You don't just stop.

452
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,606
You do. <i>You</i> do just stop.

453
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,658
You know what they call that?
Divorce.

454
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:49,527
What?

455
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,595
Tomorrow morning,
when you go to work,

456
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:52,963
I'm having the locks changed.

457
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:55,232
Yeah, tomorrow night when
I get home from work,

458
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,734
I'm bringing a crowbar!

459
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,285
Listen to yourself.

460
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,437
(Door slams)

461
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:04,458
Two babies, two tumors, one liver.

462
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,661
How's Karev supposed
to make a call like that?

463
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:10,397
Well, first,

464
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:13,050
he'll try to avoid having
to make the call at all.

465
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,069
He'll try to find another donor.

466
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,289
ALEX: Call UNOS every 20 minutes
until they have something.

467
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,023
He'll bug UNOS...

468
00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:20,558
And call every hospital,
their transplant teams...

469
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,042
BAILEY:
Comb the hospital,

470
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:26,330
every hospital in Seattle
for a matching liver.

471
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:30,351
Then he'll do a physical
evaluation of each baby

472
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:33,737
to look for any
other malformations...

473
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:37,491
see which one
seems healthier overall.

474
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,644
Then he'll do a full lab work-up,

475
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:42,913
go over and over the results,

476
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:47,034
look for any other possible
co-existing problems,

477
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:51,422
like a kidney disease
or heart anomalies.

478
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:54,859
At... at this point, he's hoping
to find something wrong.

479
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,176
Hey. I'm here.

480
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,311
MIRANDA:
And if he's smart,

481
00:18:57,312 --> 00:19:00,331
he's got someone
double checking his work.

482
00:19:00,332 --> 00:19:02,934
And then it's down
to the tumors themselves.

483
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,085
What's the distance of the tumor
from the cantlie line?

484
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:06,687
(Sighs)
8 millimeters.

485
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,605
Yeah, I know I just called,
but this infant

486
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,707
is on a timeframe, so if you just...

487
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,075
Yes, I'll hold.

488
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:15,579
Check and recheck every scan.

489
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,732
See if they involve
more than one lobe.

490
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:22,369
If there's infiltration
of other structures.

491
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:27,190
You just don't give up
until you find your answer.

00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:54,718
The staging is the same.

501
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:56,853
Both tumors
are causing renal failure.

502
00:19:56,854 --> 00:19:58,455
Look, what about the measurements.

503
00:19:58,456 --> 00:20:00,006
The girl's tumor's bigger.

504
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:01,058
The boy's is smaller,

505
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:02,726
but it's invading
the left hepatic vein.

506
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:04,662
One's too big,
the other one's too complicated.

507
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:05,763
It's a dead freaking heat.

508
00:20:05,764 --> 00:20:09,316
You need food
and a shower and sleep.

509
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:10,984
You need to walk away for a minute.

510
00:20:10,985 --> 00:20:12,836
I'm serious.

(Sighs)

513
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,911
- Try UNOS again.
- Yeah.

514
00:20:26,884 --> 00:20:28,084
Hey.

515
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:31,971
All nighter?

516
00:20:31,972 --> 00:20:34,541
Yeah.

517
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:36,626
And I need to go back.

518
00:20:36,627 --> 00:20:39,130
I just, uh... I just need
a couple hours' sleep.

519
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:42,333
Can we talk?

520
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:44,150
Yeah.

521
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:46,870
Okay, yeah.

522
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:57,046
A-are you...

523
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,731
I found this...

524
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:02,485
When I was unpacking...
I, uh, wasn't snooping.

525
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:04,687
I know it's kind of none
of my business, but...

526
00:21:04,688 --> 00:21:06,589
- Oh.
- I picked it up.

527
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,157
And then I just
couldn't put it down.

528
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:09,792
Oh, okay, this.

529
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:11,477
You have babies?

530
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,213
No, no, these are embryos.

531
00:21:14,214 --> 00:21:16,365
With Izzie?

532
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:19,135
Listen, Izzie wanted
to freeze her eggs.

533
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:21,237
She needed them fertilized.
I did it, she froze them.

534
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,473
- That's all.
- That's all?

535
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:24,974
Yeah, then she left me.

536
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:26,109
That's all. You can toss it.

537
00:21:29,263 --> 00:21:31,581
So, you wanted
to have babies with her?

538
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,120
Yeah, I... I don't...
I don't know.

539
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:40,556
I mean, that was...
that was a hundred years ago.

540
00:21:40,557 --> 00:21:44,327
I'm just asking
because when I asked you

541
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:45,962
if you wanted to move in with me,

542
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:47,364
you said that you did

543
00:21:47,365 --> 00:21:49,231
and that you could
picture a life with me,

544
00:21:49,232 --> 00:21:51,000
but you never said anything
about babies.

545
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:53,971
You said,
"Maybe we could get a dog."

546
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:55,439
Do you want a dog?

547
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,423
No, I want to know
what we're doing here.

548
00:21:57,424 --> 00:22:00,536
I love you, and you love me.

549
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:01,827
I know, but when I look ahead...

550
00:22:01,828 --> 00:22:03,347
Why are we looking ahead?

551
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:05,348
If you had or maybe
you do have, for all I know,

552
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:07,751
a bunch of Izzie babies walking
around with your face on them...

553
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:09,435
And why are we doing it now?

554
00:22:09,436 --> 00:22:12,254
And... and I'm just
the "let's get a dog" girl?

555
00:22:12,255 --> 00:22:14,558
I'm wondering what you think
we are, what you want.

556
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,409
Look, I didn't have babies
with Izzie.

557
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,094
My role in that whole thing
was with a cup and a magazine.

558
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:21,030
But you would have.

559
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:22,781
You wanted to.

560
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:25,684
<i>She</i> was worth it to you.

561
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:28,354
But when I ask you
if you want to have babies,

562
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:30,456
you're all, "I don't know,
yes, no, maybe, uh..."

563
00:22:30,457 --> 00:22:31,907
She was my wife.

564
00:22:31,908 --> 00:22:33,592
- We were married.
- That's my point.

565
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:35,144
- What am I?
- She had cancer.

566
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,396
She didn't even know if she was gonna
be able to after the radiation.

567
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,498
No, don't do... what,
I have to get sick

568
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:42,001
to figure out if you're
gonna go all in with me?

569
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:45,304
And now you're gonna go.

570
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:47,172
Yes.

571
00:22:47,173 --> 00:22:49,808
And you're right... it's kind of
none of your business.

572
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:51,261
And I'm not doing this!

573
00:22:51,262 --> 00:22:53,812
I'm not talking about babies
that I didn't have with Izzie

574
00:22:53,813 --> 00:22:55,898
or may or may not have with you.

575
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:57,850
I have two real babies
I'm responsible for

576
00:22:57,851 --> 00:22:59,068
at the hospital right now.

577
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:01,771
I have enough kids to take care of.

578
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:03,188
(Door opens and closes)

579
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,941
Hey.

580
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:15,293
How did you negotiate your contract?

581
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:16,777
What?

582
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:18,012
I mean, what did they offer?

583
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:19,580
You were coming
from private practice,

584
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:21,165
so you had a salary
you could leverage.

585
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,817
- How much was that?
- Mer, stop it.

586
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,418
Well, just tell me.
I won't tell anyone.

587
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,423
If one of your kids had to die,
which one would you choose and why?

588
00:23:29,424 --> 00:23:32,326
Well, Bailey because he
kept me up all night.

589
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,428
But ask me tomorrow,
it might be Zola.

590
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:36,097
Why? What's... what's going on?

591
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:38,949
I have two newborns
who need a liver transplant

592
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,734
- and one liver.
- Ugh.

593
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:43,404
The other one won't survive
until tomorrow.

594
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:45,606
Well, you have to run all the tests.

595
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:47,374
Yeah, every test is a tie.

596
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,527
There's no medical
question anymore, Mer.

597
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,480
They're just kids now,
and I got to decide

598
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:54,215
whether the boy lives
or the girl lives.

599
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:57,885
I mean, Alex, you really have
to trust your instincts.

600
00:23:57,886 --> 00:23:59,453
I don't know, Mer.

601
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:01,722
If I was one of these kids,
with my family,

602
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:04,158
where I came from,
I wouldn't have bet on me.

603
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,695
I... I would have looked
in my crystal ball

604
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,998
and seen a druggie or a burnout or...

605
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:13,200
I would not have seen me as
the guy who make the decisions.

606
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,670
I would not have seen that coming.

607
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:20,007
I mean, what if one of them
becomes a serial killer,

608
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:23,277
the other one's
gonna cure Alzheimer's?

609
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:25,579
That's not your problem.

610
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,815
I mean, it's just like
raising your own kids.

611
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:29,416
They're gonna be who they are.

612
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:32,503
We just have to try to give them
the best shot we can.

613
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,637
(Footsteps approaching)

614
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,589
Hey. Hey.

615
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,425
The twins' lungs are filling with fluid.
You're out of time.

616
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:40,410
Screw it.
I'm not making this call.

617
00:24:40,411 --> 00:24:42,329
If there's a decision to be made

618
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,431
about withdrawing care from
an infant, Bailey can do it.

619
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:45,732
She's the chief.
She can do it, not me.

620
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:48,135
No, no, hey, no, no, Alex.
What are you doing?

621
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:49,437
I have been watching you.

622
00:24:49,438 --> 00:24:52,005
I have been in awe of you
stepping up for these babies,

623
00:24:52,006 --> 00:24:53,807
for these parents in a way that...

624
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:56,578
(Sighs) Do you remember
the first time we ever talked?

625
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,178
Really talked.

626
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:00,447
We were on a plane,
and we just picked up

627
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:02,550
a transplant organ
from a kid who died,

628
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:04,284
and you were upset and pissy

629
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:06,421
because you thought
that I didn't care.

630
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,723
But I thought, "Wow."

631
00:25:09,724 --> 00:25:11,925
This guy could do it.

632
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:16,329
He cares enough about this work.

633
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,231
"This guy has it."

634
00:25:18,232 --> 00:25:21,451
And I knew that day, Alex.

635
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:23,003
And today...

636
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:30,677
I have been so proud of you.

637
00:25:32,513 --> 00:25:35,115
And so now you can't...
you can't hand it over

638
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,217
to somebody else
because they're yours,

639
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:38,752
and they need you,
and you can do it.

640
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:40,720
And you have to because
if you give it to Bailey,

641
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:43,490
you won't be able to look at yourself
in the mirror. I promise you.

642
00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:46,509
You'll always wonder what kind
of doctor you could be.

643
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,913
This is the job, Alex,

644
00:25:49,914 --> 00:25:53,249
and it's why you get paid
the big bucks.

645
00:25:57,538 --> 00:25:59,839
Mason, this is Dr. Bailey.

646
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,410
I've asked her
to perform your operation

647
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:04,144
to remove the lobe
of your liver for donation.

648
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,645
And who will get it?

649
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:10,550
Well, the test and the scans
were inconclusive.

650
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:12,502
I need to open up both babies.

651
00:26:12,503 --> 00:26:14,988
I need to see both tumors up close.

652
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:17,425
And then I'll decide.

653

You have to?

654

In order to make the best choice,

655
00:26:20,628 --> 00:26:23,780
the right choice,
or we risk losing them both.

656
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:27,001

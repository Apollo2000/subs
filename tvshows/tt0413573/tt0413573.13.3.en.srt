Okay, um...

162
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,326
She is in a procedure room.

163
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,563
She is getting a few stitches
on her forearm.

164
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,764
Looks fine otherwise.

165
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,566
Oh, thank goodness. Thank you.

166
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,102
And those two over there,
they're my children.

167
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,671
Are they okay?
Morgan and Julian Fisher.

168
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,506
Morgan... they are making sure

169
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,007
that her heart and lungs are okay.

170
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,844
Julian has a broken arm
and a cut on his forehead,

171
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,479
but I made sure he's okay, so...

172
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,315
And Carl ruptured his spleen.
Gene broke some ribs.

173
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,517
Michelle mostly has broken glass
in her hair.

174
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,618
Lynne has whiplash.

175
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,620
Only Pete came through unscathed.

176
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,855
Pete is...

177
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,290
Pete is my husband. He's dead.

178
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:34,693
This was Pete's funeral.

179
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:37,195
Oh, God, ma'am.

180
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,664
- Georgia.
- Georgia, I'm so sorry.

181
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,300
You shouldn't... Someone
should be taking care of you.

182
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,635
We have a waiting area...

183
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:44,703
You know, right now,

184
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,705
I really feel like
I need to be doing something.

185
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,307
But if you could find out
where they took him...

186
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,143
You got it, yeah.

187
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:53,845
Edwards!

188
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,916
Sir, I know...

189
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,820
The patient in this bed
is deceased.

190
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:02,726
I know.

191
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,056
Not just deceased, embalmed.

192
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,360
The deceased, Peter...
it was his funeral.

193
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,162
The hearse and the coffin
got totaled,

194
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,840
and the EMTs couldn't just
leave him in the street.

195
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:12,831
Call the morgue.

196
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,833
I did, but they're taking
their sweet time.

197
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,035
There's not a lot of urgency
in that job, I think.

198
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,385
Then call them again.

199
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,450
And find some place else
for Mr., um...

200
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:21,510
Peter.

201
00:07:21,544 --> 00:07:23,174
This is a room
for healing the sick.

202
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:23,742
Yes, sir.

203
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,545
Corpse in
the emergency department.

204
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,254
It's just creepy is what it is.

205
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:30,347
[Screams]

206
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:33,051
Kara, I need you to try
and slow your breathing, okay?

207
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,386
Oh, God, is he alive?

208
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,555
I can't even feel
his little kicks.

209
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,909
He may be less active from
the pain meds we gave you, okay?

210
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:40,559
Please, just tell me... Is he...

211
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,160
- [Heartbeat]
- Okay, you hear that?

212
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,842
- Mm.
- That's a strong, stable heartbeat.

213
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:44,800
He's okay.

214
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:46,404
- Films are back.
- Yeah. good.

215
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,768
Hey, uh, do we know
where the deceased guy was put?

216
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,370
- Um...
- What? Who else is hurt?

217
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,272
Is everyone hurt?
Did I kill anyone?

218
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,376
Oh, you were the driver?

219
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,611
[Sobs]

220
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,946
I was late for the funeral.

221
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,582
I came around the corner,
and there they were,

222
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,550
the whole procession.

223
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,052
I ran right into them.

224
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,620
It was me.

225
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,014
Owen: Kara, it was an accident.
I'm sure they'll understand.

226
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:12,624
Not my family. [Sniffles]

227
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,351
They've never understood me.

228
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,596
I haven't even seen any of them
for almost 10 years.

229
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,599
Dad maybe,

230
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:24,736
but Mom, Julian, and Morgan.

231
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,770
[Sniffles]

232
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,205
[Sobs]

233
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,407
God, I never
should have come back.

234
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,777
I just wanted to tell my Dad
that I love him.

235
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,579
It's okay, it's okay.
It's all right.

236
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,591
Kara, your pelvis is fractured,
and there may be some bleeding.

237
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:38,650
We need to do a C.T. scan
to check for bleeding

238
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,651
and other injures, all right?

239
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,886
C.T.? Is that safe for him?

240
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,200
It's a minimal risk for the baby,

241
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:44,589
but we need to know how badly
you're bleeding, okay?

242
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,291
[Groaning]

243
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,227
Yeah, um, just... just page me
when she's in C.T.

244
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,740
[Sighs]

245
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,508
The clinic is supplied for crap.

246
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,144
You didn't pick up my calls
or answer my texts.

247
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,646
Arizona...

248
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,114
I was worried about you.

249
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,649
No, you were mad at me.

250
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,617
Damn right I was mad.
I'm still mad.

251
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,818
You beat up my roommate.

252
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,353
So, that's why you're mad?

253
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,789
Some guy you barely know
who pays you rent got beat up?

254
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,857
[Sighs]

255
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,492
What the hell is wrong with you?

256
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,761
Look, let's not do this.
I've had enough lectures.

257
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,159
I'm not in the mood
for another one.

258
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:27,666
Your job is
to take care of children.

259
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,934
Look, Arizona...

260
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:32,971
Your job is
to take care of children.

261
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,840
You want to throw
your life away? Or your career?

262
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,235
The career
that I helped you build?

263
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:38,043
I trained you.

264
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,177
I had your back,

265
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,213
and I always pushed for you,
no matter what anybody said.

266
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:42,814
- I know!
- Alex!

267
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:43,915
I know all of this.

268
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,910
You can't tell me anything
I haven't already heard

269
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:47,986
from Bailey or Mer or Jo...

270
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,821
or frankly,
the State of Washington.

271
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,324
And hearing it one more time
isn't gonna help anything

272
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,226
or change anything or fix me
or turn back time,

273
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,829
so just shut up
and back off, please.

274
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,833
Excuse me.

00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,148
What do you got?

277
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:27,145
Possible mesenteric tear.

278

Hm. Hemothorax here.

00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,663
Is Pierce okay?

She's in the pit, I think.

No, I mean with me.

Oh, don't flatter yourself.
She'll live.

All right, all right.

You know, for what it's worth,
I feel pretty bad about it.

285
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:40,938
She's my sister.

286
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:43,003
You think I like telling her
she can't have the good thing?

287
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:45,176
Then let's just come clean,
tell her why.

288
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,212
We'll feel better.
It'll feel really good.

289
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,081
Why don't you just focus
on your patient's hemothorax?

00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,929
All right.

Excuse me.

You called me a good thing.

00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:03,120
- Forget I said it.
- You ain't the boss of me.

00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:05,873
Actually, I own a big chunk
of this hospital,

296
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,948
so technically, I am.

Hey, what are you doing here?

301
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,099
So, I've been prescribed movement,

302
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,253
since my incision's healed.

303
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:28,418
I'm supposed to get up, get out.

304
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:29,465
I can walk now.

305
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,116
I should walk, actually,
you know, to get better.

306
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,072
So, walking.

307
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:33,859
You can walk around the block,
you know?

308
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,256
In the neighborhood. It's a really nice
neighborhood. You should check it out.

309
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,812
Yeah, I know, it's totally...

310

It's s-super nice.
So is the house.

311
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,983
Um, but I figured... I-I figured
you'd want to see the baby.

312
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:43,952
- You know what?
- That's really sweet of you.

313
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:46,021
I-I did just see her
like an hour ago.

314
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:48,023
I know, but look at this one.

00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:50,425
You can't get enough
of this little nugget.

316

No, I guess you can't.

317
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:54,139
Okay, so, we are just gonna go
down to the E.R. for a minute,

318
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:55,603
check out what's going on
down there.

319
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:57,032
I hear there's a big MVC.

320
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:57,966
- Really?
- So...

321
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,833
What?

322
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:00,206
You're gonna take her down
to the E.R....

323
00:12:00,231 --> 00:12:02,951
a newborn with all the blood,
germs, and dying people?

324
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:05,421
Right. Not a good idea.

325
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:06,975
No. I'll walk you out.

326
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:10,712
Who wants to see Daddy?

327
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:12,881
- No, that... Hey, sweetheart.
- Oh, there.

328
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:14,716
You excited to see Daddy? So good.

329
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,985
Okay. Bring her back
when she's hungry.

330
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:19,931
Hey.

331
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,392
I picked up Tuck,
and you know what?

332
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:25,126
Tuck's teacher said
he got in a fight.

333
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,161
Oh?

334
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:28,463
They... They said that
he pushed another child

335
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,531
and that he started it.

336
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:30,699
They said that?

337
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:33,101
They also said

338
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:35,899
they told you all of this
already over the phone.

339
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,539
- How's that, now?
- Miranda.

340
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:39,841
I must have, uh, misheard.

341
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,043
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[Chuckles]

342
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:42,844
Aren't you gonna go in there

343
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:44,512
and bring down the hammer on him?

344
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:46,414
I'm gonna let him sweat it out.

345
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:48,083
But he knows what's coming.

346
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:50,719
The hammer will fall.

347
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:55,690
Your husband has been moved
to a private room,

348
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:57,592
and the funeral home
has been notified.

349
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:59,194
Okay. Okay, thank you.

350
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:01,596
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

351
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,597
What's wrong?

352
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:04,099
Your daughter was injured.

353
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,234
She is okay, and the baby is okay.

354
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:09,337
- 35 weeks, almost time.
- What?

355
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,072
But I'm afraid, uh, your daughter

356
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:13,083
was the one
who caused the accident.

357
00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:14,355
No, I think you're confused.

358
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:16,778
Morgan was in the car with me
when we got hit.

359
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,246
I'm so sorry.

360
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,215
Uh, your other daughter, Kara.

361
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:22,527
Kara?

362
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,186
Like I said, she and the baby
are both stable.

363
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,331
Kara's here?

364
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:28,423
Kara's having a baby?

365
00:13:28,457 --> 00:13:30,125
- Kara?
- What?

366
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,359
She... is.

367
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:35,230
She... fractured her pelvis.

368
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:37,065
Kara's here?

369
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:39,768
Wait. Kara was driving the car?

370
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:41,236
Morgan: She's pregnant?

371
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,371
You have got to be kidding me!

372
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,273
She had the nerve to show up!

373
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:47,566
- Kara did this to us?!
- She said it was an accident.

374
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,802
- Of course she did. Classic.
- Julian.

375
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:51,479
Drugs again, right? Has to be.

376
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:53,715
- I hope not.
- They said she's knocked up.

377
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,417
Good Lord, what's next?

378
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:58,319
What Pete and Georgia did
to be saddled with that mess!

379
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:00,478
You said my husband was here.

380
00:14:00,512 --> 00:14:02,223
Can I see him, please?

381
00:14:10,877 --> 00:14:11,877
I'm sorry.

382
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:14,002
This was the best place
we could find for him.

383
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,141
The morgue guys were supposed to
come and get him,

384
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:21,739
but they said he was dead
when he got here,

385
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:22,869
so he's not their problem.

386
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:24,585
He's the funeral home's problem.

387
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:26,078
And it's just become
this whole big thing...

388
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:26,900
Edwards.

389
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:30,285
Take all the time you need.

390
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:49,622
Always thought I'd go first.

391
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:51,840
[Chuckles]

392
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:52,874
Actually, no.

393
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:57,130
If I pictured it,
I thought we'd go together...

394
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,841
holding each other's hands.

395
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:08,725
Honey...

396
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:11,069
Kara's back.

397
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:14,022
It's a miracle.

398
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,899
Kara came home.

399
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:19,834
Our baby came home.

400
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:26,007
- A felony?
- I know.

401
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,842
I mean, he did beat him up
really bad.

402
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:28,776
Yeah, he did.

403
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:30,422
Then again, you can punch
a cardio surgeon

404
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,012
in a hospital hallway,
and nobody says a word.

405
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:33,341
Wait, wait... apples and oranges.

406
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,492
And yet Alex is charged
with a felony assault.

407
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:36,916
Apples and oranges.

408
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,520
Riggs and I, it was personal.

409
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:39,802
No, just apples.

410
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:41,103
It was about Wilson.
It's about a girl.

411
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:42,410
How is that not personal?

412
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:45,360
Shepherd just paged.
The mom's okay.

413
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:46,471
Oh, good.

414
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:49,079
Kara, we just got word
that your mom is fine.

415
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:50,331
She wasn't hurt.

416
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,633
Okay, thanks.

417
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:53,768
Does she know I'm here?

418
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:55,396
Yeah, I think that they told her.

419
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,112
Oh, God.

420
00:15:57,146 --> 00:15:58,077
[Sobs]

421
00:15:58,112 --> 00:16:02,427
Then she knows.
She knows that it was me.

422
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,012
Maybe that wasn't a great idea.

423
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,867
But, I mean,
I thought that she should know.

424
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:07,948
They haven't seen each other
in like 10 years.

425
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:10,385
Oh. Um...

426
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:12,887
Kara, I'm... I'm so sorry,

427
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:15,012
but the machine cannot get
a clear read

428
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:17,458
unless you're very, very still.

429
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:19,527
Okay. [Stifled sobbing]

430
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,428

434
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:33,474
I mean, can you imagine
saying goodbye to somebody

435
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:36,979
you've woken up next to
every day for 40 years?

00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:39,732
So, Riggs, huh?

437
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:44,586
It's nothing.
I mean... it's nothing <i>now.</i>

438
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,889
It's stilted conversations
and avoiding eye contact.

439
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,557
And he said no?

440
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,725
Oh, yeah.

441
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,093

Yeah.

We don't have to talk about it.

I've been trying to talk about it,

but Mer won't listen.

the whole thing happened.

00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:51,598
Just turn off all that.

[Elevator bell dings]

649
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:56,144
I'm... I'm not sure
what all... that means.

650
00:24:56,178 --> 00:24:58,179
Just go out with her
and be someone else.

651
00:24:58,214 --> 00:24:59,347
Don't be you.

652
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:00,849
Be a jerk?

653
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:01,927
Yes.

654
00:25:01,962 --> 00:25:03,218
With bad breath?

655
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,652
Exactly.

656
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,722
Because being myself
would be too...

657
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,190
Oh, forget it.

658
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:15,663
Hold one moment.

659
00:25:15,698 --> 00:25:16,931
- Thank you.
- Of course.

660
00:25:16,966 --> 00:25:18,199
Oh. [Clears throat]

661

You're not a single parent.

662

Oh, you think Tucker Jones
is gonna punish him.

663
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:26,040
'Cause he's Mr. Fun Dad.

Mr. Ice Cream and camping trips
and video games.

665
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:31,713
I'm the one who has to dole out
all the punishment.

666
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:35,283
Look, I... I mean that Tuck has
<i>three</i> parents.

667
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:37,519
I love him.
And I'm pissed at him, too.

668
00:25:37,553 --> 00:25:39,920
I know you feel like
you have to do it all.

669
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,589
No, I'm going to do it.

670
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:42,924
But you don't have to.

671
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,259
I'm right here. Let me!

You need a bad cop.

Deputize me.

674
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,571
What does Mer say exactly
when you talk about Riggs?

675
00:25:56,605 --> 00:25:57,939
She just...

676
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,474
So, the morgue is on its way.

Uh, they said since she died
in the hospital,

678

they are more than happy to come.

679

Tell them to wait,
and keep your voice down.

- Show some respect.
- Respect?

681
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:15,256
Uh... we're having a funeral?

682
00:26:15,682 --> 00:26:17,559
That's allowed?

683
00:26:18,102 --> 00:26:19,327
It's fine.

684
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:21,796
Okay. I'll let the morgue know.

685
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,066
You were saying.

00:26:27,027 --> 00:26:28,102
What?

687
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:30,305
It's like
she doesn't want to hear it.

00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,306
At all.

689
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,142
Like I'm annoying her.

Which, maybe I am,
but be a sister, sister.

I mean, if it was her

692
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:44,352
and she was... craving something
that she couldn't have,

693
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:45,866
I would commiserate.

694
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,592
I would at least listen.

695
00:26:47,626 --> 00:26:49,691
I'll listen to you. Anytime.

696
00:26:49,725 --> 00:26:53,061
Mm, I don't think that now
is the best time.

697
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:56,765
I'm not listening.

698
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,639
Then how'd you know to say that
if you weren't listening?

If Dr. Webber finds out about
this, I'm gonna be in trouble.

I told you it's fine.
Nobody needs the room.

702

This family
was primed for a funeral.

00:27:18,106 --> 00:27:19,346
Not hers.

704
00:27:20,128 --> 00:27:22,463
I wish I was as good as Mer
at forgetting things.

My life would be
a lot easier if I was.

She thinks they're gone,

but trust me... they are not gone.

They're gonna come back.
They always come back.

with me moving out.

What?

No, she squeezed it.

I was holding her hand,
and she squeezed it.

I'm telling you.

you did feel something.

No, no, no,

Yes, muscles can spasm,
and then they stiffen.

There are a lot of reasons
for slight movements.

It's a low, low bar
for a physician.

How is she, besides undead?

We won't know about neuro deficits

until after the cardiac workup.

fell three stories off
his building into the alley.

762

Ooh, Dumpster dive.

with intubation.

I cannot wait. Can't you?

00:29:58,112 --> 00:30:00,545
Yeah, that's what can happen
when you punch people, Tuck.

- Mm-hmm.
- Who is that?

784
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:04,393
Doesn't matter.
I'll tell you who it used to be.

- He <i>was</i> a surgeon.
- That's right.

But now he may never be one

She could have had
impaired venous return

due to dynamic hyperinflation
of the lungs,

No one knows for sure
why this happens.

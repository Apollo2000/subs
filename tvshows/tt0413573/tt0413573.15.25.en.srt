*** amount of fear,

2
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:07,198
Unbearable pain.

3
00:00:09,614 --> 00:00:10,974
Cruel injustice.

00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:25,889
As surgeons, we are
faced with it every day.

6
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:40,870
Impossible diagnosis.

7
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,916
Family tragedy.

8
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:06,930
Looming mortality.

9
00:01:17,231 --> 00:01:19,676
We face yours while we face our own.

10
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:29,552
And some days, in the thick of it,

11
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:30,920
in the worst of it...

12
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,547
...we feel just as lost as you do.

13
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:49,205
- Somebody, help me!
- Aah! Get me out of here!

14
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,540
Are you okay?

15
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:53,543
Something's wrong. I can't get out!

16
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:57,881
- Aah!
- Somebody, help me!

17
00:01:57,905 --> 00:01:59,849
Stay in your car, sir.

18
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:01,084
Are you okay?

19
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:02,652
Stay by your cars.

20
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:03,887
People aren't stopping!

21
00:02:04,912 --> 00:02:06,389
I can't see anything!

22
00:02:07,414 --> 00:02:09,659
Whoa!

24
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:20,236
I have to go. I have to get out of here.

25
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,071
I can't let him go tank his whole career.

26
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:23,840
I can't decompress the chamber.

27
00:02:23,864 --> 00:02:26,843
We get the bends if we decompress
too fast, and Gus could die.

28
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:28,378
- I'm not doing it.
- Is there a phone in here?

29
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:29,956
Yeah, it calls those tech guys out there.

30
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,015
You want to tell them how your
boyfriend's going to jail for you

31
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,416
and you still haven't said "I love you"?

32
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,084
Is that what you're gonna do?
You're gonna judge me?

33
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:36,252
Now?

34
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:37,420
No.

35
00:02:37,444 --> 00:02:38,955
Just...

36
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:42,725
What can we do for Gus?
How can we help him?

37
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:43,860
Nothing.

38
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:45,094
We just wait.

39
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:46,896
We... We... We let the oxygen do its job,

40
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,865
and we hope they get the blood
here in time.

41
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:50,099
So while we're stuck here,
you want to tell me

42
00:02:50,123 --> 00:02:52,068
what the hell is going on with my wife?

43
00:02:57,397 --> 00:02:58,399
Thanks, Bailey.

44
00:02:58,424 --> 00:02:59,576
We'll be in soon.

45
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,578
Okay.

46
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:03,279
Babysitter's on the way.

47
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:05,949
Bailey is expecting us.

48
00:03:05,973 --> 00:03:07,484
I want my mom.

49
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:11,154
Oh, uh... okay.

50
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:12,722
Can I...

51
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:13,957
Should I call her?

52
00:03:13,981 --> 00:03:16,059
She died a long time ago.

53
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,474
Uh... okay.

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,498
What would she say?

55
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:23,132
If she were here, what would she say?

56
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:24,367
S-She was a planner.

57
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:27,403
She made lists,
so she'd be so angry with me.

58
00:03:27,427 --> 00:03:29,105
'Cause I don't even have a nursery yet.

59
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:30,974
And I didn't ever make it
to the birthing classes.

60
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:33,276
And Owen and I haven't even
talked about baby names.

61
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,478
And there's a really good man
back at my apartment

62
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:37,180
putting together a changing table,

63
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:38,181
and he's not even the baby's father,

64
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:40,049
so she would be so mad at me.

65
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:43,953
But still, she would
rub my back, and she would say,

66
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:45,755
"Baby girl, I am always on your side,

67
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:47,824
no matter how wrong I think you are."

68
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:50,059
Mm. She'd...

69
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,528
Oh!

70
00:03:51,552 --> 00:03:52,898
Whoa, God!

71
00:03:52,922 --> 00:03:53,963
Oh, God!

72
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:56,199
Okay. First contraction.

73
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:58,835
Holy... Ow!

74
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,471
Oh!

75
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:03,940
What are you doing? Why don't you call...

76
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:05,241
just call... call an ambulance?!

77
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:07,210
If the next one comes
in under three minutes,

78
00:04:07,234 --> 00:04:08,244
we'll call an ambulance.

79
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:09,812
If not, we are fine to drive.

80
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:12,549
Oh, God. Ohh, God!

81
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:14,284
Hiiiii.

82
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:15,672
My mom said you wanted me

83
00:04:15,697 --> 00:04:17,220
to come watch Leo.

84
00:04:17,244 --> 00:04:19,022
No!

85
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:23,693
Um...

86
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:25,461
what are we, like, doing?

87
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:42,211
Um, Chief, can I speak
to you for a second?

88
00:04:42,235 --> 00:04:43,346
Are you back?

89
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,647
Um...

90
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,849
We're getting calls
about a pileup on the freeway

91
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:48,084
and my head of trauma is in labor.

92
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:50,386
My other trauma surgeon
is on some rescue mission,

93
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,689
and one of my best residents
was just arrested.

94
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:53,890
Who got arrested?

95
00:04:53,914 --> 00:04:55,858
Look, I-I know that
you're going through...

96
00:04:55,882 --> 00:04:56,926
something.

97
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,074
But if you feel you can work...?

98
00:04:59,953 --> 00:05:00,934
Yes.

99
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,045
Yes, I can work.

100
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:04,734
Okay, if I wasn't so mad
about all the other things,

101
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:05,835
I'd dance for joy.

102
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:07,337
Put on some scrubs and head to the pit.

103
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:12,342
Thank you.

104
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:18,081
No!

105
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:20,183
Okay, let me help you!

106
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:22,285
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We're gonna die.

107
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:23,386
It's okay.

108
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,520
Somebody, call 911!

109
00:05:48,402 --> 00:05:50,013
That's beautiful.

110
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:52,148
My mom used to sing it
when I couldn't fall asleep.

111
00:05:53,674 --> 00:05:55,451
Okay. Looks like a truck crashed,

112
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:57,286
and then all the cars crashed
into the truck

113
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,755
and then each other.

114
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:00,089
Okay, Frances?

115
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:01,290
You hear that?

116
00:06:01,314 --> 00:06:03,660
The sirens growing closer?
That is our ride.

117
00:06:03,684 --> 00:06:06,062
We're gonna have to get out.
Okay, Frances?

118
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:08,398
So, I'm gonna carry you
just like before, okay?

119
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:11,234
You are so very brave, and I am not.

120
00:06:11,258 --> 00:06:13,936
Frances, Gus is still alive.

121
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,072
And you're still the only one
who can save him.

122
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:17,340
Now, I get that this was scary.

123
00:06:17,364 --> 00:06:18,541
I know. I got scared, too.

124
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:21,948
But it was a miracle
that we didn't get hurt.

125
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:23,575
So let's not waste it.

126
00:06:24,337 --> 00:06:26,616
Let's go save a life, okay?

127
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:29,289
I got you. Come on.

128
00:06:35,548 --> 00:06:36,592
I got you. I got you.

129
00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:37,660
It's okay. Got you.

130
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:40,195
People are hurt.
Should we see if we can help?

131
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:41,630
We're the only ones who can help Gus,

132
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:42,798
and that is our mission.

133
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:44,867
He maketh me down to lie
in pastures green.

134
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:47,336
He... leadeth me to something waters by.

135
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,204
You a churchgoer back home, Frances?

136
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:50,539
I might be if I left my flat.

137
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:51,874
Yeah, of course.

138
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:53,509
Probably will be after this.

139
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,065
Okay, this way. Let's go.

140
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,714
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

141
00:06:58,738 --> 00:07:00,316
Ow, ow, ow! This is not normal!

142
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,550
I-I think it probably is.

143
00:07:01,574 --> 00:07:03,586
Shut up. It's not! Mnh!

144
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,687
Okay.

145
00:07:05,745 --> 00:07:07,156
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,058
- I'm sorry I said "shut up."
- That is okay.

147
00:07:09,082 --> 00:07:11,360
That is what women in normal labor do.

148
00:07:11,384 --> 00:07:13,162
Oh, my God.

149
00:07:13,186 --> 00:07:14,730
What is this traffic?!

150
00:07:14,754 --> 00:07:16,699
Well, it looks like
the freeway is closed.

151
00:07:16,723 --> 00:07:18,300
What?!

152
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:22,171
There is a multi-car pileup

153
00:07:22,195 --> 00:07:24,073
that has shut down the freeway.

154
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:26,375
Wow, and half the city is
sucked in in fog.

155
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,878
Are we thinking maybe we
should've called an ambulance?!

156
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:33,649
What are you doing?

157
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:34,750
Where are you going?!

158
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:35,751
Stay here!

159
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:37,720
Where would I possibly go?!

160
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:38,887
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

161
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:41,023
I don't want to have this baby
in your car!

162
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:44,226
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

163
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,496
Aah!

164
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,697
Yeah, we got a lot
of pissed-off people back here.

165
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:49,698
Come on.

166
00:07:49,722 --> 00:07:50,866
What's going on here?

167
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,174
Doesn't look like it's letting up at all.

168
00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:53,848
we've gotten lots of
calls about the situation...

169
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:54,937
Officer?

170
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:56,171
You want to get back in your car, Miss?

171
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:57,185
This is not safe.

172
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:58,440
Yes, I know. I will.

173
00:07:58,464 --> 00:08:00,776
Uh, but, also, there is a big baby

174
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,545
trying to come out
of a small place in my car.

175
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:04,747
- So...
- You can back up.

176
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:06,782
...could you help us
get to the hospital, please?

177
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:07,739
- No.
- Back up.

178
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:12,621
Her father raped her mother?

179
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:15,791
And, apparently, Jo looks just like him.

180
00:08:15,815 --> 00:08:17,893
And her mother...

181
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:20,696
wants nothing to do with her.

182
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,697
And her father...

183
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:22,898
I'll kill him.

184
00:08:22,922 --> 00:08:25,901
Well he's already dead.

185
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:28,671
She's agreed to talk to Bailey

186
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:32,408
and take a leave of absence
a-and get some help.

187
00:08:35,378 --> 00:08:36,612
I keep thinking about the day

188
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:39,044
she told me she was going to Pittsburgh.

189
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,130
She was laughing. She was excited.

190
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:44,820
And I said, "No." I said I was worried.

191
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:46,755
She said, "Alex, the worst thing
that could happen

192
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:48,924
is I find her,
and she's not happy about it.

193
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:51,927
Then I come home to you,
and at least I know.

194
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:54,229
At least I get to stop wondering."

195
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:57,099
I should've stopped her.

196
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:58,467
You couldn't have stopped her.

197
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:00,235
She's... She's Jo.

198
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:01,804
No, she's not. She's not Jo anymore.

199
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:03,305
She's a ghost.

200
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:04,973
I know. She needs help.

201
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:05,941
I tried.

202
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:07,609
She won't let me.

203
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,713
She needs more help
than you and I can give her.

204
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,953
Dr. Jensen to Oncology.

205
00:09:17,977 --> 00:09:20,756
Dr. Jensen to Oncology.

206
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,925
Nico, you have a new job.

207
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:25,094
Kari Donnelly. Her finger twitched.

208
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:26,695
It was probably just a muscle spasm,

209
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,130
but, uh, who knows?

210
00:09:28,154 --> 00:09:29,665
I'd like you to keep an eye on her.

211
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:32,935
What? Do you want me
to babysit a quadriplegic?

212
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:37,940
I was gonna say
witness a potential miracle.

213
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:40,876
Maybe it'll help.

214
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,344
Yeah? Help with what?

215
00:09:42,368 --> 00:09:43,879
Help you not fail your fellowship.

216
00:09:43,903 --> 00:09:45,247
I've been defending you,

217
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:47,382
but you're turning into someone
no one wants to work with.

218
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:49,118
So, go. Sit with my patient.

219
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:51,987
Who's on the cusp of a
life-changing medical breakthrough.

220
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:54,990
And try as hard as you can to care.

221
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,794
Wendy Bliss to Admitting.

222
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:00,763
Wendy Bliss to Admitting.

223
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:03,632
Hey.

224
00:10:03,656 --> 00:10:05,067
Bailey said it was slammed in here,

225
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:06,468
- so I came to help, but where...
- The fog is so thick,

226
00:10:06,492 --> 00:10:08,203
no ambulance can get through yet.

227
00:10:08,227 --> 00:10:10,906
We're just... waiting.

228
00:10:12,771 --> 00:10:14,104
How you doing?

229
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:16,779
Um...

230
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:19,648
All right. Listen to me.

231
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:21,150
- You listening?
- Yes.

232
00:10:21,174 --> 00:10:23,519
20 minutes east of here,
the fog is so thick,

233
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:24,853
no one can drive through.

234
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:27,322
But here, right outside,

235
00:10:27,346 --> 00:10:29,158
it's sunny.

236
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,193
So...

237
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:35,230
So, I'm saying...
the sun is gonna shine again.

238
00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:36,665
You just got to get...

239
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:38,834
20 minutes east of wherever you are.

240
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:42,738
Yeah, you're right. That was bad.

241
00:10:42,762 --> 00:10:44,106
- Horrible.
- I'm embarrassed.

242
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,841
Oh, my God. You should be.

243
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:46,809
...to Radiology.

244
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,100
Dr. Kelly to Radiology.

245
00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:52,581
Uh, Luis.

246
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:54,612
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Bailey.

247
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:55,884
And this is Dr. Fox.

248
00:10:55,908 --> 00:10:56,933
- Hi.
- Hello.

249
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,887
We have some good news.

250
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:00,756
All right, Gabby's
test results came back,

251
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,891
and her cancer is only Stage 2.

252
00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:04,359
That's good news?

253
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:05,828
Oh, absolutely.

254
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:09,231
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
is a very treatable cancer.

255
00:11:09,255 --> 00:11:11,767
And when it's found early, like hers was,

256
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,203
the survival rate is quite high.

257
00:11:14,227 --> 00:11:16,572
And she will require further treatment,

258
00:11:16,596 --> 00:11:18,907
but I want to assure you
that my foundation

259
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:20,943
will cover all the costs.

260
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:22,211
Thank you.

261
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:24,083
I just, uh...

262
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:27,253
my gordita has cancer.

263
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:29,985
What if something happens

264
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:33,088
before Gabby's mamá can get here?

265
00:11:33,112 --> 00:11:36,792
Sir... I want you to look at me.

266
00:11:36,816 --> 00:11:38,861
I am living with a more advanced version

267
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:42,231
of a far less treatable cancer right now.

268
00:11:42,255 --> 00:11:46,435
And I'm here, I'm working,
and I am very much alive.

269
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,804
And so is Gabby.

270
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:53,609
And we're gonna work really hard
to keep her that way.

271
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:59,281
Dr. Worden to Peds ICU.

272
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:01,783
Dr. Judy Worden to Peds ICU.

273
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:03,418
Hey, uh, uh, w...

274
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:05,020
wait a... wait a minute, everyone.

275
00:12:05,044 --> 00:12:07,122
- What's going on here?
- Dr. Webber, don't.

276
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:08,991
No. W-W-Why are you in handcuffs?

277
00:12:09,015 --> 00:12:10,792
Why is my star resident in handcuffs?

278
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:13,228
- Sir, I need you to step aside.
- DeLuca?

279
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:16,798
Look, I-I committed fraud, okay?
I'm sorry, all right?

280
00:12:16,822 --> 00:12:18,800
I'm sorry, Dr. Webber.

281
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:23,538
What the hell did he do?

282
00:12:23,562 --> 00:12:25,107
He put little Ellis Grey's name

283
00:12:25,131 --> 00:12:26,541
on another child's records.

284
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:28,443
I know. I'm sick over it, too.

285
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:30,312
And we're needed in the pit.

286
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,702
Frances, I'm gonna set you down

287
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:43,768
beside an ambulance.

288
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,394
I want you to slowly open your eyes

289
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:46,962
and try to stay calm, okay?

290
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:48,363
All right, folks,
please stay with your car.

291
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:50,232
I'm Owen Hunt,
head of trauma at Grey-Sloan.

292
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:51,934
Oh, thank God. Truck driver's critical...

293
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,036
hypertensive with a rapid
and thready pulse,

294
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,203
decreased breath sounds on the left.

295
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:56,405
We got to move him now.

296
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:57,406
I'll come with you, and I'll help out,

297
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,607
but these two need a ride, too.

298
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:00,075
- No, we don't have room.
- Well, make room.

299
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:02,077
A kid's life depends on it. Let's move.

300
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:03,879
- Let's go.
- Okay, big step, big step.

301
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:06,014
Okay, go, go, go.

302
00:13:11,043 --> 00:13:12,354
The GPS says

303
00:13:12,378 --> 00:13:14,323
we're supposed to be going... east.

304
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:15,457
We're going north.

305
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:17,025
No, we don't need the GPS, all right?

306
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:18,994
- Just follow the trail.
- What trail?

307
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:20,529
This is just a mudslide
waiting to happen.

308
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:22,431
Will you just trust, please?

309
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:23,899
- Trust what?
- Me.

310
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:26,101
Trust the ground underneath your feet.

311
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,369
It's really hard to trust the road

312
00:13:27,393 --> 00:13:28,837
when you can't see it.

313
00:13:28,861 --> 00:13:31,106
Yeah, well, sometimes you got to
trust things you can't see.

314
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,341
All right, now we just want to take

315
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:33,542
one step at a time,
and then we'll just...

316
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:34,856
Jackson!

317
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,026
Jackson!

318
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:41,760
You fell into a river.
You could have broken your neck.

319
00:13:41,784 --> 00:13:43,562
It's a creek.

320
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:45,564
It's less than a foot deep. I'm fine.

321
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:47,265
You said to trust the road.

322
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:49,434
Ah, it... it's just
a little bit of water.

323
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,703
You said to trust you and come camping,

324
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:53,238
and now there's a child dying,

325
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:55,651
and there's nobody there
to operate on him.

326
00:13:56,465 --> 00:13:57,699
Okay.

327
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:01,313
- Oh, you're mad at me now?
- No, I'm not even mad.

328
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:02,948
I just don't feel like
talking about this.

329
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:04,249
I want to focus,

330
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:05,617
just focus on getting the hell
out of these woods.

331
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:08,753
These beautiful, pristine, sacred woods

332
00:14:08,777 --> 00:14:10,255
that you're just
so damn determined to hate.

333
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,557
I don't hate them.
It's just a stressful situation.

334
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:13,692
It doesn't have to be!

335
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:14,826
This could just be a muddy situation

336
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,628
that we both go through together!

337
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:18,330
But, no. You want to assign blame.

338
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:20,232
More specifically,
you want to assign blame to me

339
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:21,466
when all I did was ask you

340
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,602
to come explore something that I love.

341
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:25,804
I'm the one that's soaked.
Am I blaming you for that?

342
00:14:25,828 --> 00:14:27,672
Kinda.

343
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:28,840
You're yelling at me.

344
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:30,709
Well, I don't want to talk!

345
00:14:39,975 --> 00:14:42,087
You are some kinda genius. I mean it.

346
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:44,022
I-I-I really think, in another life,

347
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:45,457
that you and I could be friends.

348
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:47,759
Well, then why don't we just decide

349
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:49,594
to be friends in this one?

350
00:14:49,618 --> 00:14:50,929
I mean, I'm in Leo's life.

351
00:14:50,953 --> 00:14:52,764
I'm not gonna let that change.

352
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:55,767
And we've basically been through
a police chase together.

353
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,269
I mean, think how
we could laugh about that

354
00:14:57,293 --> 00:14:58,470
if we were friends.

355
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:00,171
Seriously, you would
just have to overcome

356
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:01,506
most of your disdain for me.

357
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,441
But I really think that
you could do that if you tried.

358
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:05,388
Well, I don't disdain you, Amelia.

359
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:07,679
Um, okay, I did. Last year.

360
00:15:07,703 --> 00:15:09,481
But there was a whole brain tumor

361
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:11,950
that explained the things
that I didn't like.

362
00:15:11,974 --> 00:15:13,084
Thank you.

363
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:14,686
Because, you know, I really think people

364
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,521
don't give that tumor
the credit it deserved.

365
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,384
Are you still in love with Owen?

366
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:26,231
I mean...

367
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:27,565
maybe a little.

368
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:30,735
But I fall in love easily and quickly.

369
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,960
I mean, I could very well be in
love with someone else

370
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:34,339
by the time your baby comes.

371
00:15:34,363 --> 00:15:36,808
I'm a little in love
with this cop here right now.

372
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:39,911
Seriously. I'm very easily attracted.

373
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:41,846
You know, the last time
Owen and I broke up,

374
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,382
I walked in on him and Carina,
and I was more jealous of him

375
00:15:44,406 --> 00:15:45,517
because I had a little crush on her,

376
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,851
which is like, the reason

377
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,753
I masturbated for her in that study

378
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:51,256
which lead to my brain tumor
being diagnosed.

379
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,858
Owen and Carina?

380
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:57,228
Like, my O.B., Carina?

381
00:15:57,252 --> 00:15:59,731
Ohhhhh, no.

382
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:03,902
Aaaaaaaaah!

383
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:05,103
Oh, boy.

384
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:06,237
Oof.

385
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:09,607
Ohhhhhh, God!

386
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:18,272
Meredith?

387
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,276
They took DeLuca.

388
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,189
I know! I couldn't go after
him because I'm stuck in here.

389
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:25,924
I need you to go to the police

390
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:27,359
and tell them it was all me.

391
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:29,260
I am not gonna tell a lie to the police.

392
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:31,296
It's not a lie! It was me.

393
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,264
I mean, sure, a few of you
followed my lead,

394
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:35,300
but Andrew had nothing to do with it.

395
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:36,968
His career won't recover from this.

396
00:16:36,992 --> 00:16:38,136
You know who else won't recover?

397
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,304
Your children when
they watch their mother

398
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:40,872
get locked away.

399
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:42,207
Meredith, you could lose everything...

400
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:44,275
- your career, your family.
- I won't.

401
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:46,578
I'll hire a great lawyer, plead my case.

402
00:16:46,602 --> 00:16:48,947
I'm a well-established,
award-winning surgeon.

403
00:16:48,971 --> 00:16:50,181
This is my first offense.

404
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:52,083
I am not doing anything
until you're out of there,

405
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:53,585
and we think all of this through!

406
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,489
- Damn it, he's coding.
- Start the decompression.

407
00:16:57,513 --> 00:16:58,857
Got it.

408
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:00,158
Come on. Let's start decompression now!

409
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:04,896
What can I do?

410
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,731
Call Hunt. Tell him we need him now!

411
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,944
That is a very large needle.

412
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:21,046
He has a tension pneumo.

413
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,480
I'm gonna need to decompress his chest.

414
00:17:22,504 --> 00:17:24,015
You definitely want
to close your eyes for this.

415
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,853
Okay. Here we go.

416
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,120
Oh! That is just demented.

417
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:31,322
Schmitt, get that.

418
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:33,458
It's clearing. We're out of the fog.

419
00:17:33,482 --> 00:17:34,793
Hold on.

420
00:17:36,618 --> 00:17:38,630
Hey, Dr. Webber. It's Dr. Webber.

421
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:40,018
- Tell him we're close!
- How close?

422
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,833
- 7 minutes, uh...
- 20 minutes to extract the blood.

423
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:44,035
Uh, okay. We'll be at the hospital in 7.

424
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:49,908
Come on, Mom. You can do this.

425
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:50,942
Come on.

426
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:55,647
This is a depressing room
to be in, I know.

427
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:57,982
No, ma'am. You should keep at it.

428
00:17:58,006 --> 00:17:59,884
I think we both know I shouldn't.

429
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:00,919
Mom.

430
00:18:00,943 --> 00:18:02,620
Honey.

431
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:06,191
I think it's time to accept
the twitch for what it was...

432
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:07,292
a twitch.

433
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:09,794
The final spasm of a dying muscle.

434
00:18:09,818 --> 00:18:12,497
It's awful. And I hate it.

435
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:14,332
But I love you and...

436
00:18:14,356 --> 00:18:16,468
She just squeezed my hand!

437
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:18,069
Mom, Mom, you just...
you just squeezed my hand!

438
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:19,070
- No, I didn't.
- You did, too.

439
00:18:19,094 --> 00:18:20,205
You... You squeezed my hand!

440
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:21,372
You did, I saw it!

441
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:22,941
I-I have to...

442
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:26,077
I'll get Link. Wait, Shepherd.

443
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:27,946
I'll get them all! Yeah!

444
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,015
Oh!

445
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:37,222
So, you're feeling better? Really?

446
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:40,184
Uh, can we save a life first
and talk after?

447
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,093
Deal.

448
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:47,432
All right, 40-something driver.

449
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:49,200
Left tension pneumo
decompressed in the field.

450
00:18:49,224 --> 00:18:51,035
He's hypotensive and tachycardic.

451
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,036
He's bleeding in there somewhere.

452
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,338
Okay, trauma one.

453
00:18:53,362 --> 00:18:55,507
- Frances, let's go.
- Who's Frances?

454
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,075
- Ohh!
- This is Frances.

455
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:59,110
She needs somewhere quiet
to donate blood.

456
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:00,245
Oh, oh! You're the golden blood lady!

457
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:01,913
- I suppose I am, yes.
- I can take you!

458
00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:03,148
- Let me... Can I take her?
- Yes.

459
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:05,383
- Karev, you can take her.
- Hooray, more needles.

460
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:06,918
Dr. Bailey!

461
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:08,853
Shepherd? What the hell?

462
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:11,122
Okay, open the door. Okay. I need help.

463
00:19:11,146 --> 00:19:14,125
Okay. Okay.

464
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:15,593
You dated my O.B.,

465
00:19:15,617 --> 00:19:16,995
- and you didn't think to mention it?!
- What?

466
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:19,731
- I am so sorry.
- Oh, that's complex.

467
00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:21,432
Listen, we didn't exactly date.
We were more just...

468
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:23,401
- Oh, God!
- Why are you in a police...

469
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:25,203
- Owen... Owen, she is in labor.
- Okay.

470
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:26,804
- Okay, oh... oh, my God. Okay, don't...
- Get your hands off of me.

471
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:28,567
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

472
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,223
Alex, we should...

473
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,735
No, I'm not stopping
till that blood arrives.

474
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:45,569
This kid deserves to live.

475
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,681
He deserves to build towers

476
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:48,015
of every building in this damn world

477
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,784
and play tee-ball and hug his parents.

478
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:51,352
His good, kind parents
who have always been there

479
00:19:51,376 --> 00:19:52,520
and done everything for him.

480
00:19:52,544 --> 00:19:54,555
So, no. No, I'm not stopping.

481
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:55,823
I'm not asking you to stop.

482
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:58,592
I'm asking you to
just switch off for a minute.

483
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:00,695
Just take a break.
You're not alone in here.

484
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:01,862
The hell I'm not.

485
00:20:01,886 --> 00:20:03,464
You're gonna trade places with DeLuca

486
00:20:03,488 --> 00:20:04,532
and go to jail.

487
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:06,233
And Jo...

488
00:20:06,257 --> 00:20:08,135
Look, you're gonna disappear,
and Jo's already disappeared,

489
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,370
and I'm gonna be here all alone.

490
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:10,705
Well, you're not alone yet,

491
00:20:10,729 --> 00:20:12,606
and you're getting tired,
so just let me help!

492
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,811
Let's go! Come on, switch.
One, two, three.

493
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:29,156
I didn't ask you to change.
I'm asking you to expand.

494
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,991
That's just a fancy word for change.

495
00:20:31,015 --> 00:20:32,259
I am a grown woman.

496
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:34,395
I know what I like and what I don't like.

497
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:36,931
Okay, Maggie. But do you, really?

498
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:38,165
I mean, you constantly talk about

499
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:39,200
how you had to race through

500
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:40,768
high school, college, med school.

501
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:42,737
Those are all formative years. You know?

502
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:45,840
You were buried in books
basically from birth.

503
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:46,941
You don't think it's possible

504
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:48,976
you missed out on some aspects of life

505
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,345
that you could come to love
with some encouragement?

506
00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:52,646
Do you hear yourself?

507
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,448
Do you hear how patronizing that sounds?

508
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:57,151
I don't think that we are in this mess

509
00:20:57,175 --> 00:20:58,819
because I missed out
on my formative years

510
00:20:58,843 --> 00:20:59,820
due to my genius.

511
00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:01,355
I think that we are in this mess

512
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:03,090
because you missed out on the opportunity

513
00:21:03,114 --> 00:21:05,826
to learn consequences
due to your privilege.

514
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,595
But your mom and her money
can't get us to our car

515
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:08,763
and help me save my dying patient,

516
00:21:08,787 --> 00:21:09,997
so this is on you.

517
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:12,099
This is what consequences feel like.

518
00:21:12,123 --> 00:21:13,857
You really think that?

519
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:16,804
That's what you think of me?

520
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:18,873
I'm saying...

521
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:20,374
maybe I missed out on summer camp,

522
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:22,777
- but you missed out on a summer job.
- What?

523
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:24,779
And filling out financial aid forms

524
00:21:24,803 --> 00:21:27,448
and worrying if your family
could even afford college.

525
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:29,850
Work-study and student loans

526
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:31,685
and hoping that
you find a job after college

527
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:33,687
that can pay off your student loans.

528
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:34,889
Life stuff...

529
00:21:34,913 --> 00:21:37,124
stuff that comes
from not being Mr. Monopoly.

530
00:21:40,218 --> 00:21:41,629
Mr. Monopoly?

531
00:21:41,653 --> 00:21:42,797
Wow.

532
00:21:45,256 --> 00:21:48,169
So you just kinda don't have
any respect for me.

533
00:21:48,193 --> 00:21:50,471
And you just kinda don't like me.

534
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:52,673
Maggie, I love you.

535
00:21:52,697 --> 00:21:54,341
I know.

536
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:55,923
But you don't like me.

537
00:21:56,835 --> 00:21:58,676
Not the way I am.

538
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:01,682
You want me to expand.

539
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:10,858
Teddy, I'm sorry, really.

540
00:22:10,882 --> 00:22:12,493
It honestly never even occurred to me.

541
00:22:12,517 --> 00:22:14,061
It never occurred to you?! Ohh!

542
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:16,897
It never occurred to you to mention to me

543
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:18,566
that you slept with my O.B.?!

544
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,435
Okay. Hello.

545
00:22:22,861 --> 00:22:24,004
For what it's worth,

546
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:26,163
the affair meant very little to me.

547
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,843
Okay.

548
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:30,666
Can you spread your legs for me?

549
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,129
Hmm.

550
00:22:35,907 --> 00:22:37,017
Okay.

551
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,219
Ugh.

552
00:22:38,243 --> 00:22:39,920
Okay, you're gonna feel a little pinch.

553
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:41,745
Just tell me when it's over.

554
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:46,227
And... it's over.

555
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:47,895
- That's it?
- That's it.

556
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,630
And what happens now?

557
00:22:49,654 --> 00:22:52,199
And now you get...

558
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:53,934
Oh, well, now you get cookies

559
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:54,969
and you get juice.

560
00:22:57,061 --> 00:22:59,874
What will I feel when my blood is gone?

561
00:22:59,898 --> 00:23:02,142
Woozy, sick, empty?

562
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,311
How much extra or food might I need?

563
00:23:04,335 --> 00:23:06,647
I, um...

564
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:10,451
Frances, you have about
10 units of blood in your body,

565
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:11,952
and you can live on about 6 units.

566
00:23:11,976 --> 00:23:14,855
And I'm only taking two,
so you should feel just fine.

567
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:16,624
In fact, you should feel better than fine

568
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:18,893
because, as you sit here,
eating your cookie,

569
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,428
you are saving a little boy's life.

570
00:23:23,688 --> 00:23:24,832
This has been

571
00:23:24,856 --> 00:23:27,968
the single most terrifying day
of my life.

572
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:29,904
I heard that you don't like to travel.

573
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:31,939
A-Also, there was a pileup.

574
00:23:31,963 --> 00:23:33,807
It was legitimately terrifying.

575
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:35,843
This morning, if you'd asked me

576
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:37,945
to list my fears of what might happen,

577
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:40,080
I would've made quite a long one.

578
00:23:40,104 --> 00:23:42,950
But sitting there,
listening to vehicle after vehicle,

579
00:23:42,974 --> 00:23:46,287
the crunching sounds, the blinding fog,

580
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:48,422
the screaming...

581
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:50,824
even I couldn't have imagined that.

582
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,993
And yet, here I am,

583
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:54,828
with a frightening stench of flop sweat.

584
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:57,031
But other than that,

585
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:59,466
unscathed, sipping juice.

586
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,839
There's something about walking
through your fears...

587
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,641
actually going through the worst thing

588
00:24:07,665 --> 00:24:09,877
you could imagine happening to you...

589
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:12,112
that is oddly freeing.

590
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:22,122
I... give them supervision.

591
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:23,857
I offer guidance.

592
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:25,292
I praise them.

593
00:24:25,316 --> 00:24:27,361
I steer them on the right path
when they stumble,

594
00:24:27,385 --> 00:24:29,163
like they were my own children.

595
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:30,998
And what do I get in return?

596
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:34,234
A big, fat felony covered
in bureaucratic mess.

597
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:35,235
Lap pads.

598
00:24:36,427 --> 00:24:38,572
Well, maybe DeLuca didn't understand

599
00:24:38,596 --> 00:24:39,573
what he was doing.

600
00:24:39,597 --> 00:24:41,008
DeLuca was number two in his class.

601
00:24:41,032 --> 00:24:42,242
He understands.

602
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:44,044
Uh, the bleeding's coming
from the mesentery.

603
00:24:44,068 --> 00:24:45,813
Got it. Right angle.

604
00:24:48,573 --> 00:24:50,217
I'm just saying that there could be

605
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:51,819
another explanation.

606
00:24:51,843 --> 00:24:54,088
Um, I've been working a lot
with DeLuca lately,

607
00:24:54,112 --> 00:24:58,058
and he is smart, talented,
and excellent bedside manner.

608
00:24:58,082 --> 00:25:00,194
And his medical license is
as good as trash.

609
00:25:00,218 --> 00:25:03,664
Not to mention, he put that
asylum-seeking family at risk

610
00:25:03,688 --> 00:25:04,932
and jeopardized

611
00:25:04,956 --> 00:25:07,901
every hospital employee's
insurance policy.

612
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,670
And I don't think he did it alone.

613
00:25:09,694 --> 00:25:11,572
Hmm.

614
00:25:11,596 --> 00:25:13,841
Meredith Grey's name was on that chart.

615
00:25:13,865 --> 00:25:16,877
I think she participated
and DeLuca's covering for her.

616
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:19,913
- Really? Hmm?
- Really.

617
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:22,045
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

618
00:25:22,774 --> 00:25:25,919
Um, let's run the bowel again,
check for other injuries.

619
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:31,925
What do we, uh... Is it...
Is it somebody's birthday?

620
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,160
Are we singing, huh?

621
00:25:34,152 --> 00:25:35,362
Tom, be quiet, please.

622
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:36,530
What?

623
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:38,532
Mom, you can do this.

624
00:25:38,556 --> 00:25:39,933
You did it once... you can do it again.

625
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:41,907
I'm tired.

626
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:43,237
So...

627
00:25:43,261 --> 00:25:44,671
pretend it's me.

628
00:25:44,695 --> 00:25:46,540
Pretend you're fighting for me
instead of for yourself

629
00:25:46,564 --> 00:25:49,109
because you have never once gotten tired

630
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:50,611
when you've been fighting for me.

631
00:25:50,635 --> 00:25:51,712
Look.

632
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:54,581
Oh, my God!

633
00:25:57,175 --> 00:26:00,020
Did I do that? A-Am I doing that?!

634
00:26:00,044 --> 00:26:02,756
Can... Can somebody tilt me down?

635
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,058
Kari, point to me.

636
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:05,492
Tom, I don't think
she can take direction.

637
00:26:09,821 --> 00:26:10,764
Oh, my God.

638
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:13,300
I did that!

639
00:26:14,425 --> 00:26:15,524
Oh!

640
00:26:15,548 --> 00:26:16,670
I knew you could do it.

641
00:26:16,694 --> 00:26:18,272
I bet you want me to sing now.

642
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:23,143
You moved my finger.
You can sing whatever you want!

643
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:43,063
Hey! Hey!

644
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:44,298
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here!

645
00:26:44,322 --> 00:26:45,332
- Let her through!
- Move out of the way!

646
00:26:45,356 --> 00:26:46,767
Sorry! Sorry that it took so long.

647
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:48,936
We had to extract the blood,
process, and test it.

648
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,604
Okay. Okay.

649
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,441
Just squeeze the bag to make it go.

650
00:26:54,465 --> 00:26:56,515
I know, go faster. I get it.

651
00:26:58,202 --> 00:26:59,847
Are we too late? Is there enough?

652
00:26:59,871 --> 00:27:02,382
Come on, Gus. Come on. Come on.

653
00:27:02,406 --> 00:27:04,441
Come on, come on!

654
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:10,209
Come on, come on! Come on.

655
00:27:14,962 --> 00:27:17,174
Hey, we got a rhythm.

656
00:27:17,198 --> 00:27:18,542
Yes!

657
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:20,811
- Yeah.
- We got a pulse.

658
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:23,580
I'll hang another unit of LR
and keep giving him fluids.

659
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:27,350
Hey.

660
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:29,820
Hey, buddy. Hey, it's Alex.

661
00:27:29,844 --> 00:27:31,254
Remember me?

662
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:32,622
Now, your chest
is gonna feel really sore,

663
00:27:32,646 --> 00:27:34,324
but that's normal.

664
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:35,525
You're not in your regular room
right now.

665
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:37,461
We had to bring you in here for a minute.

666
00:27:37,485 --> 00:27:40,096
But it's like a medical spaceship.
It's pretty cool.

667
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,998
Where...

668
00:27:42,022 --> 00:27:43,800
Where are my LEGO bricks?

669
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:47,471
Let's go get them.

670
00:28:00,407 --> 00:28:01,618
Jo.

671
00:28:01,642 --> 00:28:03,415
I'm not okay.

672
00:28:04,512 --> 00:28:06,209
I know how to rise...

673
00:28:06,814 --> 00:28:08,558
when I need to.

674
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:11,548
And I know how to take care
of other patients, but...

675
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:13,864
I'm not okay.

676
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:16,500
I love you, and I'm sorry.

677
00:28:16,524 --> 00:28:18,030
It's okay. We'll figure it out.

678
00:28:18,054 --> 00:28:19,848
We'll... We'll talk to Bailey.

679
00:28:20,728 --> 00:28:21,975
Karev.

680
00:28:22,763 --> 00:28:24,174
Can we talk?

681
00:28:24,198 --> 00:28:25,609
It's about Meredith.

682
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:29,980
God! Ow, ow, ow!

683
00:28:30,004 --> 00:28:31,081
Something's wrong! What's wrong?!

684
00:28:31,105 --> 00:28:32,382
Something's wrong! Ow! Nothing's wrong.

685
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:34,049
Nothing is wrong, Dr. Altman.
You're crowning.

686
00:28:34,073 --> 00:28:35,252
- ! Oh, God!
- What? Already?

687
00:28:35,276 --> 00:28:37,387
Sometimes mothers
with geriatric pregnancies

688
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:39,089
- tend to have...
- Did you just say "geriatric"?!

689
00:28:39,113 --> 00:28:40,557
I-It's just the term.

690
00:28:40,581 --> 00:28:41,725
I know the term!

691
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:44,628
I'm just saying,
try not to add to my pain!

692
00:28:44,652 --> 00:28:46,696
What you're feeling right now
is called the ring of fire.

693
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,064
Do I keep pushing?

694
00:28:48,088 --> 00:28:49,733
No. You wait until the next contraction.

695
00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:51,768
Oh, God, come on!

696
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:54,404
If you like to masturbate,
it can alleviate the...

697
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:55,505
- What?!
- No!

698
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:57,407
Okay. Then... just wait.

699
00:28:57,431 --> 00:28:58,742
Oh, God, come on.

700
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:00,176
- Oh, my God, ow!
- Teddy.

701
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,511
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Teddy.

702
00:29:01,535 --> 00:29:03,079
Our daughter is coming out now.

703
00:29:03,103 --> 00:29:05,348
I know this is supposed to be...

704
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:09,085
a really beautiful moment,
but it hurts like a mother!

705
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:10,053
Oh, my God!

706
00:29:10,077 --> 00:29:11,021
I got to see this. I got...

707
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:12,322
- No, no way.
- Whoa, whoa.

708
00:29:12,346 --> 00:29:13,757
Whatever's happening down there
is not pretty.

709
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:15,158
Okay.

710
00:29:15,182 --> 00:29:17,694
Listen, Teddy, I have seen men
ripped limb from limb.

711
00:29:17,718 --> 00:29:19,629
I know, but you will not see
the war between my legs.

712
00:29:19,653 --> 00:29:21,965
You'll thank me later. No more PTSD.

713
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:24,868
Okay, here's another one. Ow!

714
00:29:24,892 --> 00:29:26,469
- Teddy, push, push, push, push, push!
- Oh, my God!

715
00:29:26,493 --> 00:29:27,938
- You got this, Major.
- Oh, my God!

716
00:29:27,962 --> 00:29:29,773
Push, push, push, push, push, push!

717
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:35,168
Hey.

718
00:29:36,637 --> 00:29:39,683
I have had a day from hell.

719
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:40,807
I miss you.

720
00:29:44,812 --> 00:29:46,851
I know I can be annoying.

721
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:51,494
I spent the day with a woman
who imagines the worst.

722
00:29:51,518 --> 00:29:53,663
And she was annoying.

723
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:55,832
Right up until the part
where she was a hero.

724
00:29:55,856 --> 00:29:56,900
Levi, I...

725
00:29:56,924 --> 00:29:59,336
I get that my feelings can be big

726
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,238
and my fears can be big,
and I can be annoying.

727
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:04,507
But I am also a pretty great guy.

728
00:30:04,828 --> 00:30:06,476
I care about the world.

729
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,778
I sing with people who are scared,

730
00:30:08,802 --> 00:30:11,748
and I help deliver blood
to dying children,

731
00:30:11,772 --> 00:30:12,949
and I care.

732
00:30:12,973 --> 00:30:14,754
And if you love me,

733
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:18,088
I deserve better than
what you've been giving me.

734
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,856
I know you do.

735
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:23,827
And I don't think you're annoying.

736
00:30:23,851 --> 00:30:25,495
I just...

737
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:26,863
I don't know.

738
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:29,466
I just get... jealous.

739
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,468
J...

740
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:33,603
Jealous of what?

741
00:30:33,627 --> 00:30:35,363
Since my patient died,

742
00:30:35,387 --> 00:30:37,340
since I... killed him...

743
00:30:38,832 --> 00:30:41,811
...the only thing I feel is angry.

744
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:43,980
I just witnessed
a medical miracle in there.

745
00:30:44,004 --> 00:30:46,316
And people are crying
and... and laughing...

746
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:50,186
...and still, all I feel is this...

747
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,888
...anger.

748
00:30:51,912 --> 00:30:54,428
I don't know how to do what you do...

749
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,693
...but I want to.

750
00:30:58,338 --> 00:30:59,696
Well, I can help with that.

751
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:06,136
Oh, oh.

752
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,904
The donor arrived!

753
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:10,040
Gus got his transfusion! Oh, my...

754
00:31:10,064 --> 00:31:11,841
Oh, this is good.

755
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:16,346
What... What is... What is this?
What is going on?

756
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:19,683
It's fog, Maggie.
We have it in the city, too.

757
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:22,886
I know what fog is.

758
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,155
But this... this is...
We can't drive in this.

759
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:26,523
Yeah, that's...

760
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:28,224
...why I stopped the car.

761
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:32,028
I'm gonna check out the situation.

762
00:31:32,052 --> 00:31:33,096
You can't see anything.

763
00:31:34,354 --> 00:31:35,732
That's why I've got a flashlight.

764
00:31:35,756 --> 00:31:37,967
Got a little bit of faith.

765
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:39,803
You can stay here
and be safe and sound...

766
00:31:39,827 --> 00:31:41,237
...and knowing exactly
at's going to happen

767
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:43,239
for the next 10 minutes, all right?

768
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:49,345
Patronizing.

769
00:31:52,406 --> 00:31:53,450
Good!

770
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:55,285
So, her head is halfway out.

771
00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:57,587
Just one more gentle push
on the next contraction.

772
00:31:57,611 --> 00:31:59,756
- I have to push now.
- You wait or you tear.

773
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,191
30 seconds. Breathe.

774
00:32:01,215 --> 00:32:02,959
But it hurts. I can't keep doing this.

775
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:04,527
Please tell me something to distract me.

776
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:06,796
Okay.

777
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,099
I'm in love with you...
I'm in love with you...

778
00:32:09,123 --> 00:32:11,301
...and I've been in love with
you since the day I met you.

779
00:32:12,893 --> 00:32:14,571
And I didn't understand

780
00:32:14,595 --> 00:32:15,839
that I was allowed to be happy.

781
00:32:15,863 --> 00:32:17,173
I was afraid.

782
00:32:17,197 --> 00:32:19,609
I was afraid that
the way that I feel around you

783
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,811
was... unsafe...

784
00:32:21,835 --> 00:32:23,913
...unsafe because it feels so good.

785
00:32:23,937 --> 00:32:26,783
You make me feel so good
that I would sabotage it...

786
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:29,452
...before life would come in
and do it for me.

787
00:32:29,476 --> 00:32:32,088
But I get that now.

788
00:32:32,112 --> 00:32:33,490
And I'm done with that now.

789
00:32:34,782 --> 00:32:36,159
Teddy...

790
00:32:36,183 --> 00:32:37,861
...I want to spend the rest of my life

791
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:41,798
proving to you
that I'm worthy of your love.

792
00:32:41,822 --> 00:32:44,434
If you'll let me.

793
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:45,969
- Another one's coming.

794
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:47,637
Here it is, it's coming! It's coming!

795
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:49,906
Push! Push, push, push! Push, push!

796
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,141
Oh, my God!

797
00:32:51,165 --> 00:32:53,977
DeLuca was not involved.
He had no prior knowledge.

798
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:55,145
I will go on record.

799
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:57,347
I take full responsibility
for my behavior.

800
00:32:58,939 --> 00:33:00,183
No, no, no, no. You two have to wait.

801
00:33:00,207 --> 00:33:01,618
You need to hear
what we have to say, okay?

802
00:33:01,642 --> 00:33:02,986
Richard, not now.

803
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,988
Y-Y-Yes, now.

804
00:33:05,012 --> 00:33:06,823
- It was me.
- No, it wasn't.

805
00:33:06,847 --> 00:33:08,892
I forged the name on Gabby's paperwork.

806
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:09,959
- No, no, no.
- Yeah.

807
00:33:09,983 --> 00:33:11,895
It was not... It was not. It was me.

808
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,697
- No, it was me. I forged it.
- It was me. Alex, stop that!

809
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:16,599
No! It was not... It was me!

810
00:33:16,623 --> 00:33:17,700
Are all of you kidding me right now?

811
00:33:17,724 --> 00:33:19,169
This is not a game!

812
00:33:19,193 --> 00:33:22,806
This is not an... an LVAD wire,
and you're not interns.

813
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,775
This is criminal behavior.
So stop this nonsense.

814
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:26,910
Bailey, it was all of us.

815
00:33:26,934 --> 00:33:27,977
Meredith may have done it,

816
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:30,280
but I knew about it, and I didn't report.

817
00:33:30,304 --> 00:33:31,781
Same. It was all of us.

818
00:33:31,805 --> 00:33:33,521
The only person it wasn't
was Andrew DeLuca.

819
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,785
- Yeah.
- Richard. You got to be kidding me.

820
00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:37,787
You are a part of this?!

821
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:40,557
Look, I'm sorry, Catherine.

822
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:41,925
I know we got it wrong.

823
00:33:41,949 --> 00:33:44,928
It was an emotional decision
and a bad one.

824
00:33:44,952 --> 00:33:46,963
But we just couldn't see
putting that father...

825
00:33:46,987 --> 00:33:50,278
that family... through any more of this.

826
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:52,969
Bailey, it was all of us.

827
00:33:52,993 --> 00:33:54,237
What do you want to do?

828
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:57,874
What do I want to do? W... I-I'm... I...

829
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:00,043
My God.

830
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:01,845
I mean, what... what can I do?

831
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:03,246
You're fired.

832
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,681
What?

833
00:34:04,705 --> 00:34:06,416
Who's fired?

834
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,852
All three of you.

835
00:34:08,876 --> 00:34:10,019
You're all fired!

836
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,995
Catherine.

837
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:21,231
Oh, my God.

838
00:34:56,997 --> 00:34:58,941
Thank you.

839
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:02,611
Push, push, push, push! Push, push!

840
00:35:02,635 --> 00:35:04,246
Yeah!

841
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,049
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

842
00:35:10,343 --> 00:35:11,510
Got it.

843
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,330
- Oh, lookit.
- Oh, my God!

844
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,770
Hey. Hey.

845
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:29,138
I know.

846
00:35:30,663 --> 00:35:32,675
Yeah.

847
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:33,809
What's her name?

848
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,311
- Allison.
- Allison.

849
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,527
Hm.

850
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:05,641
How long will you be gone?

851
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,457
Oh, just a little while.

852
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,768
But where are you going?

853
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,570
Well...

854
00:36:10,594 --> 00:36:14,030
I have to go take care
of something very important.

855
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,908
Okay? But I'll be back.

856
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:18,978
- All right?
- Okay.

857
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:20,346
And Auntie Amelia will be here

858
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,282
and Auntie Maggie and Uncle Alex.

859
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,865
There you go.

860
00:36:48,532 --> 00:36:51,845
You are... pretty wonderful.

861
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:58,184
- - I hear a "but" coming.

862
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:00,887
But I, um...

863
00:37:00,911 --> 00:37:03,056
...jumped in to you really fast.

864
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,291
On the heels of Owen, and, um...

865
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:08,995
...the life that I
thought I was building.

866
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:11,497
I'm a rebound.

867
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,633
You definitely were.

868
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:18,538
I don't know if you still are.

869
00:37:20,664 --> 00:37:23,576
So, you're saying...?

870
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,645
I'm saying I'm...

871
00:37:25,669 --> 00:37:28,081
...open to possibilities.

872
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:30,049
And that could include you.

873
00:37:30,073 --> 00:37:31,951
If you don't need me to decide anything

874
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:33,586
too permanent right now.

875
00:37:35,612 --> 00:37:37,390
I, um...

876
00:37:37,414 --> 00:37:39,025
I need time...

877
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,494
to figure out who I am outside of Owen.

878
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,098
Okay.

879
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:47,901
Okay.

880
00:37:58,101 --> 00:38:00,947
...go tree climbing, Thomas J.?

881
00:38:00,971 --> 00:38:02,548
Oh. His face hurts.

882
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,183
And where is his glasses?

883
00:38:04,207 --> 00:38:06,286
He can't see without his glasses.

884
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,922
I heard "My Girl" playing.

885
00:38:08,946 --> 00:38:10,523
Made you some soup.

886
00:38:10,547 --> 00:38:13,192
- Ohh!
- Oh, tough week?

887
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:14,861
- Aww.
- Thanks, Mom.

888
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:16,296
Yeah. Who's your friend?

889
00:38:16,903 --> 00:38:18,564
This is Nico.

890
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,133
- Hi, Nico.
- Hi.

891
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,702
He's actually my boyfriend.

892
00:38:23,961 --> 00:38:26,963
And he's the one
who's had the tough week.

893
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,476
W-We'll talk more later then.

894
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,278
- Yes.
- All right, then.

895
00:38:32,302 --> 00:38:35,148
Nico, do you like chicken noodle soup?

896
00:38:35,172 --> 00:38:36,149
Yes, ma'am.

897
00:38:36,173 --> 00:38:37,283
Well, then, this is for you.

898
00:38:37,307 --> 00:38:39,252
Oh! Thank you so much.

899
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:41,010
All right. You enjoy.

900
00:38:41,678 --> 00:38:43,122
Okay.

901
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:44,958
You all right?

902
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:56,069
You're amazing.

903
00:39:12,843 --> 00:39:15,121
When there's no clear path...

904
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:18,024
all we can do is put one foot
in front of the other.

905
00:39:21,852 --> 00:39:24,063
Dr. Karev, are you ready?

906
00:39:26,223 --> 00:39:28,067
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

907
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,017
She'll be okay.

908
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:46,486
She'll need medication and therapy,

909
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,021
but she will be okay.

910
00:39:48,045 --> 00:39:49,455
How do you know?

911
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:50,890
She's depressed.

912
00:39:50,914 --> 00:39:53,659
It's scary and it's hard,
but it's treatable.

913
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,863
Bailey, am I really fired?

914
00:39:56,887 --> 00:39:58,164
Alex Karev.

915
00:40:00,057 --> 00:40:02,133
I hate it more than you do.

916
00:40:05,262 --> 00:40:08,073
All we can do is the next right thing.

917
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,934
And then the next.

918
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,018
This was so stupid.

919
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,219
Well...

920
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:22,255
Were you expecting a thank you?

921
00:40:22,279 --> 00:40:24,023
Your career won't survive this.

922
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,725
You're going to lose your license.

923
00:40:25,749 --> 00:40:28,061
Meredith, what was I supposed to do? Huh?

924
00:40:28,085 --> 00:40:30,229
They called me into a room
and asked me for details.

925
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:31,764
Was I supposed to turn you in?

926
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:33,833
Would that have been more noble somehow?

927
00:40:33,857 --> 00:40:35,401
Well, if we're gonna be together...

928
00:40:35,425 --> 00:40:36,936
...you need to develop some instincts

929
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,438
for self-preservation.

930
00:40:38,462 --> 00:40:42,041
All I'm saying is,
let me clean up my own messes

931
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,776
and live in my own truth.

932
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,244
Because what I did was wrong.

933
00:40:45,268 --> 00:40:48,581
But what I was trying to remedy
was so much more wrong.

934
00:40:48,605 --> 00:40:51,617
And I stand by that.

935
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:53,152
You think a judge will buy that?

936
00:40:53,176 --> 00:40:54,253
I don't know.

937
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:56,222
Either way, I have to turn myself in

938
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,223
and get you out of here.

939
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,257
Meredith, don't do that.

940
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:01,360
Andrew, as stupid as this was...

941
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:05,696
...and as much as this terrifies me...

942
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:08,534
I love you, too.

943
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:44,237
In the darkness, in the fog,

944
00:41:44,261 --> 00:41:47,240
all we can do is feel our way through.

945
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,480
Jackson!

946
00:41:54,504 --> 00:41:56,449
And try to trust that somehow

947
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:58,751
we will come out on the other side.

948
00:41:58,775 --> 00:42:00,453
Jackson!

949
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,396
Jackson!

949
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:11,878

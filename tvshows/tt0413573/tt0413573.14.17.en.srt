1
00:00:01,487 --> 00:00:03,226
24 hours.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,158
1,440 minutes.

3
00:00:06,192 --> 00:00:09,609
86,400 seconds.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,281
That's all it takes for a patient

5
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:14,296
to go from sick to healthy,

6
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:16,231
from hopeful to dire...

7
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:18,334
Oh!

8
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:19,635
Sun's up, Doc. I'm outta here.

9
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:21,370
Let you sleep as long as I could.

10
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:27,042
Oh, so ridic.

11
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:37,586
Ja, ja, ich komme... I'm coming.

12
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:43,258
Okay, okay, okay, keep your pants on...

13
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,831
They're on.

14
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:50,599
Oh, my God!

15
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,800
Hi!

16
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:54,169
One day can bring you back
from the brink...

17
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:56,739
change your entire life
with one heartbeat,

18
00:00:56,773 --> 00:00:58,774
one single breath.

19
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,876
What the hell are you doing here?

20
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:05,072
It's why doctors watch you like a hawk,

21
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,552
hold you for observation.

22
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:08,717
Hey, grab this for me?
I'll be right there.

23
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:11,387
Hey, you break it, you buy it.

24
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:17,760
It's why we behave as if
your every move, every sound...

25
00:01:17,794 --> 00:01:19,695
Can I help you, doctor...

26
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:21,597
Uh, Dr. Marsh. No, I'm fine, I'm good.

27
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:23,766
I'm great.

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,968
Just, um... I had a kidney transplant.

29
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,236
...every input...

30
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,771
I can see that. Congratulations.

31
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:31,054
I can also see your ride
is leaving without you.

32
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:32,427
...and output.

33
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:34,410
No, when I said I had
a kidney transplant,

34
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:36,044
I meant I had a... kidney transplant.

35
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,247
Just a little one.
I'm five-weeks post-op,

36
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:39,715
and I'm... I'm great. I'm just...

37
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:40,949
...is life or death.

38
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:43,218
Dr. Marsh! Can I get a gurney over here?!

39
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:44,620
I got it!

40
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:46,298
Because it is.

41
00:01:47,297 --> 00:01:54,355

00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:58,100
Okay, I'm not finding you
in the system, Mr. Zigler.

43
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:00,736
Possibly because my last name
is Rigler, with an R.

44
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,571
Ah. I'm sorry.

45
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:05,340
It happens to the best of us, Dr. Zepner?

46
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,610
Ah, here you are. Okay.

47
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,846
You were here a week ago
with diverticulitis.

48
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,247
- Yeah.
- You saw Dr. Bailey.

49
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:13,916
Yeah, it's the third time
it happened to me,

50
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,751
and she gave me antibiotics... each time.

51
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:17,653
She didn't suggest surgery?

52
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:19,755
Well, she said that antibiotics would be

53
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:22,124
the less-invasive option,
and I really wanted to go

54
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:23,759
on my synagogue's youth trip.

55
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:24,927
You a little old for that?

56
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:27,696
I'm a rabbi,
and I've been around long enough

57
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,474
to know you don't stick a junior rabbi

58
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:31,967
with a bunch of hormonal teens
on a weekend trip.

59
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:36,438
Anyway, I started feeling like I
was coming down with something,

60
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:38,974
and... and then I got this rash.

61
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:41,009
Which I thought it would get
better in a few days,

62
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:45,380
but it got worse... a lot... a lot worse.

63
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,982
- Can I take a look?
- Yeah.

64
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,240
Here we go.

65
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:54,043
Yeah.

66
00:02:54,077 --> 00:02:55,678
Okay.

67
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:59,615
- O... kay.
- Yeah.

68
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:01,317
All right.

69
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:04,453
Page Dr. Avery, and tell
the burn unit we're on our way.

70
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:11,360
So, tell me.

71
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:12,628
Tell you what?

72
00:03:12,662 --> 00:03:14,163
Whatever it is that you wanted to say,

73
00:03:14,197 --> 00:03:16,031
but you couldn't say
in an e-mail or over the phone,

74
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:18,300
that you had to show up at my
door in the middle of the night.

75
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:19,668
I mean, it must be...

76
00:03:19,703 --> 00:03:21,003
Is it Amelia's tumor?

77
00:03:21,037 --> 00:03:22,569
No, no, it's nothing like that.

78
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,740
Oh, I... Is she pregnant?

79
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:26,075
Owen, are you going back to Iraq?

80
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:27,543
Will you just tell me what it is?

81
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:28,544
I can't take it.

82
00:03:28,578 --> 00:03:30,512
Amelia and I are done.

83
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:34,683
We're done, Teddy.

84
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:40,489
So, for the first time, you and me...

85
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,325
there's nothing standing in our way.

86
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:50,199
Okay. So, I said something,

87
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:53,335
so you gotta say something, so...

88
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,860
Go ahead... ask.

89
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:20,262
I wasn't going to.

90
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:22,631
You want to know why I was operating

91
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:24,800
not six weeks post-kidney-transplant.

92
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:28,237
You're dying to know, but you're
too polite to ask, so ask.

93
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:31,073
I'm not polite. It's none of my business.

94
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:32,074
Mm-hmm.

95
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:33,542
The thought did cross my mind.

96
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:36,779
Well, you know what they say...

97
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:38,387
doctors make the worst patients.

98
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:41,483
I'm rejecting it, aren't I?

99
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:42,818
That's what's happening...

100
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm rejecting my kidney,
or I formed a clot.

101
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:45,954
Have you had any other symptoms...

102
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:47,289
oliguria, nausea, vomiting?

103
00:04:47,323 --> 00:04:49,158
Nothing. Up until
a few hours ago, I was fine.

104
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:51,326
A few hours ago, you were
supposed to be on medical leave.

105
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:53,595
I was, but my pain's
been at a consistent 3,

106
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,931
and I've been off narcotics for weeks.

107
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:57,499
What's your immunosuppressive regimen?

108
00:04:57,534 --> 00:04:58,734
Tacro, azathioprine,

109
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:00,803
and I stopped prednisone post-op day 4.

110
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:02,237
Any mTOR inhibitors?

111
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:04,673
No. I'm keeping that bullet
in the chamber.

112
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:06,742
For the next time
you defy doctors' orders

113
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:09,311
and perform an organ recovery
that someone else could've done?

114
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:11,113
I mean, come on.
You cannot expect surgeons

115
00:05:11,147 --> 00:05:13,849
to just sit on the sidelines
watching surgeries go by.

116
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:15,584
It's not gonna happen.

117
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:19,288
I donated half of my liver.
I spent the month in a bed.

118
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:21,523
Yeah, and I bet you hated
every second of it.

119
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:28,130
Vicki Greenberg.

120
00:05:28,164 --> 00:05:32,167
59 years old, fantastic mom,
even better grandmother.

121
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:34,002
She can decoupage like a rock star

122
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:35,971
and makes a ridiculously good salmon.

123
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:37,089
Your favorite patient.

124
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:38,807
Six years she's been
waiting for that liver.

125
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:41,610
Me? I was on dialysis for
a month when I got my kidney.

126
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:43,312
A month is hell, but it's nothing.

127
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:45,681
For six years, Vicki's been
miserable, dying.

128
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:48,383
You think I was gonna leave that
in anyone else's hands but mine?

129
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:49,585
- No.
- No.

130
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:52,955
So I came back a week early, and
I was fine until I wasn't.

131
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:55,991
Just... tell me I didn't screw
this up, Dr. Grey.

132
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:57,826
Tell me I'm not gonna lose this kidney.

133
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:59,795
Well, we have to wait
for your labs to come back.

134
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:02,698
I'll do an ultrasound, and let's
just not get ahead of ourselves.

135
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,201
Too late.

136
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:12,674
Oh. Hey. What's the good word, Doc?

137
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:18,180
I'm not making my synagogue trip, am I?

138
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:20,682
Which means someone's
gonna get pregnant, or drunk...

139
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:21,850
probably both.

140
00:06:21,885 --> 00:06:22,851
Rabbi...

141
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:24,853
Oh, no, please... Eli.

142
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:27,155
I mean, you're shellacking
half my body in Vaseline.

143
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,391
I think we can dispense
with the formalities.

144
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:34,029
Eli, you have toxic epidermal necrolysis,

145
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:35,564
also known as TEN.

146
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:38,200
It's a reaction to the
antibiotics you were prescribed.

147
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:41,103
It's what's causing your skin
to separate from itself.

148
00:06:41,137 --> 00:06:44,873
That sounds... about as
disgusting as it looks.

149
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:49,378
I-I thought I took the
antibiotics as prescribed.

150
00:06:49,412 --> 00:06:53,181
You did. TEN is something that
just happens to some patients.

151
00:06:53,216 --> 00:06:54,750
Nobody's really sure why.

152
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:57,686
Hard to believe
that something this disgusting

153
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,588
just... happens.

154
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:01,623
Dr. Kepner and I are gonna do
our very best

155
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:02,758
to keep you comfortable

156
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:05,694
and prevent this thing
from progressing any further.

157
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:08,063
Oh, good. 'Cause I gotta be honest...

158
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:09,965
this is not my best look.

159
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:13,869
You sure there's no one we can call?

160
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:15,070
A family member...

161
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:18,073
Oh, my wife, Elyse. She's on a train.

162
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:20,642
She's on her way back
from visiting her mother.

163
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:22,978
I don't really... want to worry her.

164
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,080
Eli...

165
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:28,383
You're saying worry her.

166
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,059
Couldn't hurt to have her company is all.

167
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:43,565
How is he?

168
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,935
You know the expression
"makes his flesh crawl"?

169
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,503
Yeah, he's kind of like that,

170
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:50,172
except in a hundred times more pain.

171
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:52,908
Oh. He had diverticulitis.

172
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:54,409
I gave him antibiotics...

173
00:07:54,444 --> 00:07:56,745
For the third time. You didn't want to...

174
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,480
I don't know... try something different?

175
00:07:58,514 --> 00:08:01,239
I made a judgment call
based on the standard of care.

176
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:04,054
You can take antibiotics
a dozen times and no reaction.

177
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,421
It's random. It's awful, but it's random.

178
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:07,923
You didn't do anything wrong.

179
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:10,692
Look, I-I can take over from here.

180
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:12,661
- He was my patient.
- No, no. No way.

181
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:15,263
No, I'm not gonna let you go in
there and tell him you screwed up

182
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:17,299
and then sit by his bedside
and make it all about you.

183
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,034
- April.
- April, you know that's not fair.

184
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:21,103
All right? Any one of us
could've done the same thing.

185
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:23,005
Yeah, but we didn't, and she did,

186
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,606
and I'm not about to let her sit vigil

187
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:25,807
while he circles the drain.

188
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:27,142
I know you're going through something.

189
00:08:27,176 --> 00:08:29,378
I want to help. I truly do.
But that doesn't mean you...

190
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:31,146
This has nothing to do with me, Jackson.

191
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,814
I am just trying to clean up her mess.

192
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,450
We've all seen his labs.
He has a SCORTEN of 5.

193
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:37,219
We can give him as much care as we want,

194
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:39,287
but he'll be lucky if
he makes it through the night.

195
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:41,523
And if he doesn't, that's on her.

196
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:43,458
Fair or not.

197
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:00,071
No thrombosis in the renal
artery. That's good.

198
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:01,296
No hydronephrosis.

199
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:03,865
No fluid collections, no obstructions,

200
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,435
cysts, abscesses...

201
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:07,469
Yeah.

202
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:08,904
Looks good.

203
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:11,073
One hurdle down, one more to go.

204
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:14,142
Oh, and Mayo called and said
that Vicki's transplant surgery

205
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:15,777
is going off without a hitch.

206
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:18,914
She's gonna give me so much crap
for bailing on her surgery.

207
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:21,650
Well, she'll live... quite literally.

208
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:24,319
So when do I get my labs back?

209
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:26,883
Soon.

210
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:30,559
Well, you don't suppose
slipping a cool $20

211
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:32,961
to the boys down at the lab
would help speed this up,

212
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:34,262
- do you?
- I'm afraid not.

213
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:35,464
How 'bout a $50?

214
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:37,669
How's your pain?

215
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:40,435
Me? I'm all good. Perfect,
painless, Marathon ready,

216
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,837
or at least a strong 1OK.

217
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,171
Mm-hmm. How'd it work out for you

218
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:44,439
last time you pretended you were fine?

219
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:46,241
That's, uh... That's a good point.

220
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:48,577
I'd say I'm about a 3, 3 1/2,

221
00:09:48,611 --> 00:09:49,978
but I'm gonna muscle through.

222
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:51,613
Is this you playing it tough?

223
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:53,648
Because you just did a liver recovery

224
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:55,851
5 weeks post-op from your own surgery.

225
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:57,093
No, no, no, no.

226
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:59,488
This is me trying to avoid
an unnecessary addiction

227
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:01,089
to opioids, if I can help it.

228
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:02,324
Slippery slope and all.

229
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:05,260
Great. As soon as those labs
come in, I'm gonna let you know.

230
00:10:05,294 --> 00:10:07,963
This is the part where you
leave me, sad and alone,

231
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:09,698
leaving me no choice but to contemplate

232
00:10:09,732 --> 00:10:13,933
my dark, miserable, kidney-less
future, so sad and so alone?

233
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:16,104
You're the one who said you
didn't want to call any family.

234
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:18,607
That is true. That's because
Charlotte is a 16-year-old

235
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:20,776
who'll fail calculus
if she misses her mid-term,

236
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,178
and I am way too math-dumb to
pull her out of that hole.

237
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:27,208
And yet you're a transplant surgeon.

238
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:28,795
Oh, yeah. World class.

239
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,602
You felt the need to add that?

240
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:33,789
When I'm talking to Harper Avery-winning
Meredith Grey, yeah, I do.

241
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:35,957
See? You don't even need any visitors.

242
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:37,125
You have so much Internet

243
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,193
stalking to do.

244
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:40,162
I really do need
to go check on my patients.

245
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:41,966
W-Well, uh, tell me about them.

246
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:44,858
Traditional stuff or another
abdominal-wall transplant?

247
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:47,151
I am doing two lap choles

248
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:50,188
and repairing a transected biliary duct.

249
00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:52,110
Mm. How thin is the duct?

250
00:10:52,145 --> 00:10:53,424
2 millimeters.

251
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:54,760
- Damn.
- Right?

252
00:10:58,564 --> 00:11:00,932
So, is, uh... is Charlotte
your daughter, or...?

253
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:03,534
Uh, my niece. Uh, Erica, my sister,

254
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:06,671
she's a... she's a limited person.

255
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:09,540
She's got a gig heart
and good intentions,

256
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:11,042
just zero follow-through.

257
00:11:11,076 --> 00:11:12,276
Well, that's polite of you.

258
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:13,378
Oh, you want the truth?

259
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:14,545
Always.

260
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,158
Uh...

261
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:18,783
My selfish little sister
did one thing right

262
00:11:18,817 --> 00:11:20,451
in her selfish little life,

263
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:22,186
and then she crapped all over that,

264
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:23,888
so I stepped up.

265
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:25,590
I took Charlotte in, and...

266
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:27,792
it's the best thing I ever did.

267
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:31,429
What about you? You got kids,
nieces, pets, stowaways?

268
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:32,897
What are we talking about here?

269
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:34,132
I do. I have three kids.

270
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,133
Wow.

271
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:36,534
And an occasional stowaway.

272
00:11:36,568 --> 00:11:37,898
- I...
- What's the matter?

273
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,570
I'm just looking for your
superhero cape is all.

274
00:11:39,605 --> 00:11:41,572
- I'm not seeing it.
- I have a lot of help.

275
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:43,005
Oh, do you? What's that like?

276
00:11:43,714 --> 00:11:45,445
Your kids have a dad?

277
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:47,150
They did.

278
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:51,549
All right, million-dollar question...

279
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,551
what would you do
if you weren't a doctor?

280
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,621
I... There is nothing I would rather be.

281
00:11:56,655 --> 00:11:58,556
No, I mean, what if
you couldn't be a doctor?

282
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,757
What then? What's your Plan B?

283
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:00,974
There's no Plan B.

284
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:02,994
There really hasn't ever been a Plan B.

285
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:05,563
So, wait, wait. You had visions
of cutting people's bowels open

286
00:12:05,597 --> 00:12:07,899
straight out of the womb, and it's
been smooth sailing ever since?

287
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,600
- Really?
- Yes. Well, there was, like,

288
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:11,569
a switch from neuro to general,
but pretty much, yeah.

289
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:14,138
Wow. That is...

290
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:15,306
Crazy.

291
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,775
Well, I was gonna say amazing,
but, yeah, "crazy" will do.

292
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,977
So, what about you?
You just woke up one morning

293
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:22,146
and couldn't decide whether you
wanted to make French toast

294
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:23,181
or become a transplant surgeon?

295
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:25,850
I wasn't exactly a legacy,
if that's what you mean.

296
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:27,852
First one in my family to go
to college, actually.

297
00:12:27,886 --> 00:12:30,521
And you work at one of the best
hospitals in the world.

298
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:32,256
Your mother must be so disappointed.

299
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:35,359
Well, I'd like to think she'd
be a little proud, yeah.

300
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:38,329
When did she pass?

301
00:12:38,363 --> 00:12:40,932
- I was 15.
- Oh.

302
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:43,267
- Tough age.
- Yeah, she was... she was kind.

303
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:45,103
And strange.

304
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:46,771
And a terrible dresser.

305
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,674
Impossibly smart.

306
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,375
She had heart failure.

307
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,177
She was on a list a long time.

308
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,714
Hearts are hard to come by.

309
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:59,517
Kidneys aren't as easy
as you'd think, either.

310
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:00,718
No, they're not.

311
00:13:00,753 --> 00:13:03,688
So she's why you decided to
became a transplant surgeon?

312
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:05,056
No, I-I loved cardio, I loved neuro,

313
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,290
I loved all of it, really.

314
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:09,160
I just... I just couldn't sit still.

315
00:13:09,194 --> 00:13:11,562
Transplant surgeons, you're
always in another city...

316
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:13,631
in another country, if you're lucky.

317
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:15,066
Plus, I like to fly.

318
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,067
Mnh.

319
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:17,068
What? Not a fan?

320
00:13:17,102 --> 00:13:20,071
No.

321
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,341
So, where do you keep it?

322
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,509
Keep what?

323
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:25,628
Your Harper Avery.

324
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:28,415
Okay, I just... I really...

325
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:29,680
Nick, I have patients.

326
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:32,416
Is it dead center on the mantel?
Fancy glass case in the study?

327
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:34,485
What, did you just chuck it
in some closet somewhere?

328
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,654
Tell me, tell me, tell me.
What, is it a hat rack?

329
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:38,856
As soon as your labs come in,

330
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:41,314
I will come down and let you know.

331
00:13:41,348 --> 00:13:42,660
- Okay.
- Okay?

332
00:13:42,694 --> 00:13:44,390
Just one last question.

333
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:48,432
Just answer me this, Dr. Grey...

334
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:49,500
Meredith.

335
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:50,835
Meredith.

336
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:53,838
Do you think I'm gonna lose this kidney?

337
00:13:53,872 --> 00:13:56,009
Your ultrasound looked great,

338
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,922
but until your other labs come back,

339
00:13:57,957 --> 00:13:59,510
there's no way to definitively know...

340
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:01,746
Yeah. Well, I'm asking what you think.

341
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:04,348
I don't know.

342
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,373
Are you good there?

343
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:23,946
You know, it's possible
I imagined this moment once...

344
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:26,949
okay, a hundred times... but it
didn't ever involve laughing.

345
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:29,619
You're in my bed, in Germany.

346
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:32,021
I mean, you are in my bed, in Germany.

347
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:34,729
Owen Hunt, naked, in my bed.

348
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:37,427
- Yeah, yeah. I don't even like Germany.
- Yeah, me neither!

349
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,772
I know I should ask you why
you're here, but...

350
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:51,908
- I told you.
- It's just...

351
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:54,749
You imagined this, too?

352
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,346
I imagined this, too.

353
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:14,332
No, absolutely not.

354
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:15,766
When are you gonna admit
that you're wrong?

355
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:18,102
- It was a CABG.
- It was a coronary artery dissection.

356
00:15:18,136 --> 00:15:19,738
CABG. It was a freakin' CABG.

357
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:22,500
I said that I would take the
coronary artery dissection.

358
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:23,774
What was that guy?

359
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:25,104
He was that annoying guy with the...

360
00:15:25,138 --> 00:15:26,377
Ratliff, with the...

361
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:28,279
Tattoo of Jim Morrison on his shoulder.

362
00:15:28,313 --> 00:15:29,942
Right, I was prepping him,
and then you walked in

363
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:31,958
and started barking
like some crazed sea lion,

364
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:34,227
and you told Sergeant Teller
to take the dissection,

365
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:35,328
and I ended up with the CABG.

366
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:36,829
Oh, oh, oh! And then, um...

367
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:38,842
you made me assist because you said

368
00:15:38,867 --> 00:15:40,925
that I put you in the minors when
you should've been in the majors.

369
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,753
Okay, I have never used a
baseball metaphor in my life.

370
00:15:43,754 --> 00:15:45,955
Ooh! You were pissed,
but you were excellent.

371
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:47,523
I was.

372
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:49,292
And you were a sufficient assist.

373
00:15:49,326 --> 00:15:50,459
Sufficient.

374
00:15:50,494 --> 00:15:51,561
Yeah. What do you want me to say?

375
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:53,029
That you were flawless and brilliant

376
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:54,463
and you anticipated my every move

377
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:57,773
and I knew the moment that we
shared that O.R...

378
00:15:58,302 --> 00:16:00,770
that I wanted to do that
the rest of my life?

379
00:16:00,804 --> 00:16:02,538
I did.

380
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:03,873
I mean, with you assisting me,

381
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:05,641
but, you know, it's the same thing.

382
00:16:08,178 --> 00:16:10,613
You are such a slob.

383
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:12,949
And you're beautiful.

384
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:15,618
Oh, my God.

385
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:19,655
This, right here,
when it snows, this is...

386
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:23,326
this is the one time
I really love this place.

387
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:28,598
You remember when you made it
snow in the desert

388
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:30,466
for our guys in the 54th?

389
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:34,303
You blindfolded them,
and you put their face

390
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:37,640
up to the machine so they could
feel it before it melted?

391
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:39,308
It made them happy.

392
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:42,745
You were so good at that.

393
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:45,046
All the grand gestures,

394
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,198
you did it better
than anyone else I know.

395
00:16:53,557 --> 00:16:55,825
Owen, what are you doing here?

396
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:57,660
I told you.

397
00:16:57,694 --> 00:16:59,161
No, I mean...

398
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:04,100
I mean, is... is this it?

399
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:05,835
Right here, this? Is this...

400
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,837
I mean...

401
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,374
Are you getting on a plane
tomorrow, and... and... and...

402
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:13,209
and we have this...

403
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:15,511
As amazing as this is, this isn't...

404
00:17:15,545 --> 00:17:17,546
What?

405
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:19,615
- This isn't real.
- Why can't it be?

406
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,652
Because I live a million miles
and time zones away,

407
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:24,620
and I have a big life here, Owen.

408
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:26,355
Yeah, but you hate Germany, so...

409
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,157
Yeah, but I love my job,
and I love my friends.

410
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:30,626
And there's this restaurant
on the corner, and they know me,

411
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:32,662
and they make this roast chicken...

412
00:17:32,696 --> 00:17:35,498
I mean, the best roasted chicken
that I've ever tasted before.

413
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,088
And I'm opening up a clinic for refugees,

414
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,669
and I have the finances
and the resources,

415
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,837
and it's finally, finally happening.

416
00:17:41,872 --> 00:17:46,175
And I... I have made a life here
for myself, and...

417
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:48,217
And why can't I be part of that?

418
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,981
Do you want to be a part of it?

419
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:53,883
I mean, you would move to Germany?

420
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,651
Why not? I mean, I'm a trauma surgeon.

421
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:57,019
I could work with you...

422
00:17:57,054 --> 00:17:58,688
- For me.
- For you.

423
00:17:58,722 --> 00:18:01,590
Or... Or I could find a job
at a different hospital,

424
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,524
if that's not what you want.

425
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:09,732
I can move here and be with you, and...

426
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:12,702
And you'd be leaving Megan
behind and your mom.

427
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:16,739
Or you could come back to Seattle.

428
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:18,741
Pierce is unreal,
and the two of you together...

429
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:20,710
Or we could half and half
or go to Canada.

430
00:18:20,744 --> 00:18:21,744
Canada.

431
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:23,446
Or I don't know. I don't know.

432
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,716
I haven't figured that
all out yet, but I just know...

433
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,418
I just know that I want to be with you.

434
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:31,587
I just know that I want you.

435
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:34,890
This is not some grand gesture
or some... some whimsical...

436
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:36,836
Yeah. Yeah, it is fast,

437
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:38,594
and I haven't figured out all the moves,

438
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:41,397
but that doesn't make this any less...

439
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:45,768
I am in love with you... Teddy.

440
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,445
I realized I loved you
and how long I've loved you.

441
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:51,822
So I got on a plane.

442
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:56,212
You got on a plane.

443
00:18:56,246 --> 00:18:57,780
Yeah.

444
00:18:57,814 --> 00:18:59,648
I got on a plane.

445
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:22,925
Stay a few days.

446
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:26,275
I'll show you around the hospital, and...

447
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:28,677
we can go hiking around Bismarck Tower.

448
00:19:28,712 --> 00:19:32,148
You can show me
your roasted chicken place.

449
00:19:32,182 --> 00:19:34,083
Yeah, back off. That place is all mine.

450
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:38,087
So, can you? Stay?

451
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:40,858
Sure. I'll make a couple calls.
Kepner can take my shifts.

452
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:43,825
Sure. I mean, just like that, sure.

453
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:45,627
Teddy, I told you.

454
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:50,999
Tell me this doesn't scare you.

455
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:52,801
Why should it?

456
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:55,203
You know me. I know you.

457
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:56,938
This has been...

458
00:20:00,255 --> 00:20:02,123
We know we work.

459
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,845
What if it doesn't?

460
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:04,879
Can't think like that.

461
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:06,214
Yeah, but I do. You know I do.

462
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,183
You know everything about me.

463
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:10,494
You're my first call in a crisis,

464
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:15,023
or when I've just done the most
perfect LIMA to LAD anastomosis,

465
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:18,626
and you just...
you make things real and better,

466
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,130
and you tell me when I'm being an ass.

467
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,034
Yeah, I know.
You're my best friend, Owen.

468
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,303
Isn't that what they say?

469
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:30,108
You should marry your best friend?

470
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:32,007
Oh, really? So now we're getting married?

471
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,141
No, I... What I...

472
00:20:33,175 --> 00:20:34,642
You just got out of a marriage.

473
00:20:34,677 --> 00:20:35,744
That led me to you.

474
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:37,579
Teddy, I get that you're scared,

475
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,881
but there's no... that's not a reason...

476
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:42,433
Wait. What do you mean, "led me to you"?

477
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:45,887
Well, I just mean, Amelia, she...

478
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:47,594
Listen...

479
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:49,591
marrying Amelia was a mistake.

480
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,859
You said it yourself.

481
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:54,796
It was not a marriage, and she
and I, we can both admit that.

482
00:20:56,032 --> 00:20:57,932
She's... Amelia's a gambler.

483
00:20:57,967 --> 00:20:59,034
Or she was a gambler.

484
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:01,669
It's hard to tell the difference
between Tumor Amelia

485
00:21:01,704 --> 00:21:03,905
and Amelia Amelia, but we took a gamble,

486
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:05,940
and it fell apart because
it wasn't meant...

487
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:09,944
My point is, she was right.

488
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:12,847
Being here with you, it makes
all the sense in the world.

489
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:14,183
Wait. She said that?

490
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:16,684
Well, not in so many... She just...

491
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:22,390
Listen, she knows me, and she
knows how much you mean to me,

492
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:25,360
so when she said it, it...
it... it just made sense.

493
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:27,729
All I'm trying to say is,

494
00:21:27,763 --> 00:21:28,730
she is the one who pointed out

495
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:31,066
that there's always been
something between us,

496
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,634
and she was right, so I...

497
00:21:34,485 --> 00:21:36,204
So you got on a plane to me.

498
00:21:36,238 --> 00:21:37,639
Yes.

499
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,641
Teddy...

500
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,643
Teddy, there's no reason to make this...

501
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:42,777
Wait.

502
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:45,313
What were you... What were you
doing when she said this?

503
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:49,150
- Uh...
- Owen?

504
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:53,054
Owen.

505
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:54,989
You were sleeping with her.

506
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:56,925
Teddy...

507
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,493
When? When did she say this?

508
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:04,599
Last night.

509
00:22:15,328 --> 00:22:18,562
I was a near-impossible match, you know.

510
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,122
I took the one kidney in
my world someone could offer...

511
00:22:21,157 --> 00:22:22,857
my best friend.

512
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:27,562
If I have to look him in the eye
and tell him I blew it...

513
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,230
But you can't think like that.

514
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,532
I can't help it.

515
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:32,667
We won't know until we know.

516
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:39,741
I used to think shoe salesman...
for my Plan B.

517
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,909
You have a thing for feet?

518
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,010
What, deal-breaker?

519
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:43,411
I mean, kind of, yeah.

520
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,413
There's no world in which a shoe salesman

521
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,549
comes home at night
and thinks about shoes.

522
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,250
He goes to work, he deals with feet

523
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,419
and weird people all day,
but, hell, so do we.

524
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:54,155
Except what's the worst thing
he can cause?

525
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,157
Blisters? Bad arch support?

526
00:22:56,192 --> 00:22:59,761
That job is the epitome
of "No Harm, No Foul."

527
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,930
Plus, actual vacation time.

528
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:02,931
"Used to think."

529
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:03,932
What's that?

530
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,366
You said you used to think

531
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:06,943
that's what you would do for a living.

532
00:23:06,978 --> 00:23:10,323
That's just what I consider when
a patient's lung craps out on me

533
00:23:10,357 --> 00:23:12,907
or the plane lands five minutes
too late to recover an organ.

534
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:14,075
But that's not the fantasy.

535
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,277
- No.
- So what is?

536
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,378
Your turn.

537
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:20,048
My turn? I'm just here to listen.

538
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:21,082
No, you're not.

539
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:22,083
I'm not?

540
00:23:22,118 --> 00:23:23,084
No.

541
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,075
Okay. Well, there was one time

542
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,123
when I thought I would be
working at the multiplex

543
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,192
with my best friend Cristina,
but that was just...

544
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:32,794
Your version of shoe salesman.

545
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,863
More like hospital-mandated
therapy, but...

546
00:23:34,897 --> 00:23:36,598
Ooh! Now we're getting to the good stuff.

547
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,034
But you don't have an answer, do you?

548
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:42,837
You don't know what you would do
if you weren't a doctor.

549
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,541
My dad took us
out to the Boundary Waters.

550
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:48,042
- You know them?
- No.

551
00:23:48,077 --> 00:23:50,411
Right on the edge,
between Minnesota and Canada.

552
00:23:51,413 --> 00:23:53,882
These huge stretches of lake.

553
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:57,118
You have to portage your canoes
on your shoulders for miles.

554
00:23:57,153 --> 00:24:00,123
Every morning, my dad would
take me out in a canoe.

555
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,375
We'd be up so early,

556
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,093
you could see the cobwebs
reflecting off the reeds.

557
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:09,998
And just dead, eerie, incredible silence.

558
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:15,570
My dad would get this look on his face.

559
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:18,606
If I couldn't be a doctor,
I'd go sit in that canoe

560
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:20,241
until I felt... even for a second...

561
00:24:20,276 --> 00:24:21,943
what he was feeling.

562
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,848
Or you know what? Screw it.

563
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,683
I'll be a shoe salesman.
That's where it's at.

564
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,918
Fewer mosquitoes, too.

565
00:24:31,153 --> 00:24:32,153
Hey, it's your turn.

566
00:24:32,188 --> 00:24:34,355
I just got way too personal
on our first date,

567
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,157
- so your turn.
- Excuse me?

568
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:39,160
Joking. That was me making a joke.

569
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:40,528
I am your doctor.

570
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:42,096
Hey, thank God for that, right?

571
00:24:42,131 --> 00:24:44,866
Listen, the reality is, as soon
as I'm good to go here,

572
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,601
I'm on a plane back to Minnesota.

573
00:24:46,635 --> 00:24:49,170
Mayo's got my back.
You never have to see me again.

574
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:51,472
Mm. Whew.

575
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:55,109
So what's a little deep, dark
confession amongst friends?

576
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:58,613
Okay.

577
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:00,381
Um...

578
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,150
Have you ever been to Sardinia?

579
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:03,852
- Sardinia.
- Mm.

580
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:05,486
Nude beach and a bottle of wine.

581
00:25:05,521 --> 00:25:07,055
Helluva party. Excellent choice.

582
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,023
So, when I was young,

583
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:11,893
my girlfriend and I stayed
in this tiny village.

584
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,697
And I think we paid this woman like $2

585
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:18,066
to crash at her house
and drink all of her wine.

586
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,634
And she was 97.

587
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:21,636
Her sister was 101.

588
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,972
The neighbor was 99.

589
00:25:24,006 --> 00:25:26,875
And they grew their own food,
and they wandered

590
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:30,545
these little cobblestone streets
with chickens to the beaches.

591
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:32,847
Wait. I'm sorry. Did the
chickens wander on the beach,

592
00:25:32,882 --> 00:25:33,815
or how does that work?

593
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:36,251
No, the people...
these incredible people...

594
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:40,054
who were laughing and fighting
with the people they loved,

595
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:42,090
and no one was in any rush.

596
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,524
No one had anywhere to go.

597
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,759
And they were happy.

598
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,661
So you want to go live with the chickens

599
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:47,729
and the happy people?

600
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:49,063
- Yes.
- Okay.

601
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:50,665
Me and my kids.

602
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:53,334
And my sisters can come
because they can do the cooking

603
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:55,403
and the growing because, I mean, please.

604
00:25:56,906 --> 00:25:58,273
And everyone's already living

605
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,375
till they were
a hundred years old, right?

606
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:02,243
There's no cancer or Alzheimer's,

607
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:05,113
so there's no lives for me
to save, and...

608
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:08,008
no one will die on my watch.

609
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:10,084
Sounds pretty good.

610
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:12,120
Just me and my kids and a hammock

611
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,088
and a stack of books that I'll buy

612
00:26:14,123 --> 00:26:15,790
with no intention of ever reading.

613
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,760
Mm. In this scenario, I don't
suppose there's any room

614
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:21,296
on that hammock for someone
about your age?

615
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,897
Brilliant but not too brilliant,

616
00:26:22,932 --> 00:26:25,767
with one... debatably functioning kidney?

617
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:28,436
I mean, unless you wanna lug
a canoe over your head with me?

618
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,371
'Cause I'm game either way.

619
00:26:35,311 --> 00:26:36,495
Your labs.

620
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:39,380
They're what?

621
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:42,050
- Dr. Grey?
- Damn it.

622
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:43,251
Tell me.

623
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:44,285
They're inconclusive.

624
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,054
- Meredith...
- Um... okay.

625
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:47,889
Wait.

626
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:49,757
The biopsy is normal.

627
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:51,793
Your bloodwork is showing
a normal white count.

628
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:52,961
What about my GFR?

629
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:53,962
It's down.

630
00:26:53,996 --> 00:26:55,229
- Creatinine?
- It's doubled.

631
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:56,931
But you also have proteinuria.

632
00:26:56,966 --> 00:26:58,299
Something isn't making sense.

633
00:26:58,334 --> 00:27:00,601
I can't lose my kidney, Meredith, please.

634
00:27:08,177 --> 00:27:10,244
There it is. You have a clot
in your renal vein.

635
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:14,916
We need to get him
up to the O.R. right now.

636
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,485
Nothing showed up on
the ultrasound before. Why not?

637
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,088
Because the flow to the vein
is so low, but it makes sense.

638
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:22,357
You were on that plane.
You were standing in that O.R.

639
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,025
Any one of these could've caused a DVT

640
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,593
to lodge itself in your renal vein.

641
00:27:25,627 --> 00:27:28,162
Let's go, come on! We gotta go, guys!

642
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:30,431
- Meredith...
- Nick, listen,

643
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:31,632
you need an embolectomy right now

644
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:32,800
if I'm gonna save this kidney.

645
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:34,102
Third drawer, green cabinet.

646
00:27:34,136 --> 00:27:35,370
- Nick, I got this.
- No, no, no, no.

647
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,237
Third drawer, green cabinet.

648
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:38,106
That's where the deed to the house is

649
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,874
and the passcodes for
Charlotte's college fund.

650
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:40,808
She's got to go to college.

651
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:42,810
I don't care for what,
but she's gotta go.

652
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:44,379
She's kind and strong and beautiful,

653
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,380
and none of that will matter

654
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,048
if she can't string together
a decent sentence.

655
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,483
And tell her to stay the hell
away from drugs.

656
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:49,851
Her mother never could,
and it ruined her.

657
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:51,352
If she wants to drink, drink,

658
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:53,054
but there's an A.A. book
in her college folder, too,

659
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,889
just in case. Tell her, Meredith.

660
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,357
Stay with me, Nick.

661
00:27:56,392 --> 00:27:57,959
Tell her for me, Meredith, please.

662
00:27:57,993 --> 00:27:59,460
You'll tell her yourself.

663
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:00,895
Let's go!

664
00:28:05,214 --> 00:28:06,381
Elyse.

665
00:28:06,415 --> 00:28:08,316
W... Elyse?

666
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:10,118
- Eli.
- Elyse?

667
00:28:10,152 --> 00:28:12,278
Your wife, Elyse, is on her way.

668
00:28:12,303 --> 00:28:14,304
- Just hang in there, Eli.
- Okay.

669
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:17,441
I'm gonna turn up the bed warmer
to encourage wound healing.

670
00:28:17,475 --> 00:28:18,942
Huh? You're gonna make it hotter?

671
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:20,444
I'm sorry. Um...

672
00:28:20,478 --> 00:28:21,845
I can draw up some morphine.

673
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,398
- No, no, no, no!
- I don't want any pain meds.

674
00:28:23,432 --> 00:28:26,109
I don't want to be loopy.

675
00:28:27,256 --> 00:28:29,486
You couldn't just pretend?

676
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,787
I'm sorry?

677
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:32,145
I think you're my wife for two seconds.

678
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:34,524
You couldn't just, you know,
roll with it?

679
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:39,329
Eli, I can tell you're in
a great deal of pain...

680
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:41,431
- You worry too much.
- Anybody ever tell you that?

681
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:43,533
Look, I'll sign whatever papers you want.

682
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:45,502
No morphine, no more tubes. Just... Okay?

683
00:28:45,536 --> 00:28:47,537
Until my wife, Elyse,
gets here, all right?

684
00:28:47,572 --> 00:28:49,106
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, good.

685
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,041
Dr. Bailey's hovering.

686
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:52,609
Unless I'm imagining that, too.

687
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:53,644
I'm sorry about that.

688
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:55,012
She can come in if she wants.

689
00:28:55,046 --> 00:28:56,146
She's fine where she is.

690
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,447
You don't like her.

691
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:00,484
She's my boss.

692
00:29:00,518 --> 00:29:02,119
She's a good one, I can tell.

693
00:29:02,153 --> 00:29:03,754
She was a good doctor to me, too.

694
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:07,457
You don't think so?

695
00:29:07,492 --> 00:29:09,192
Well, she prescribed the antibiotics,

696
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:10,954
- and now the antibiotics...
- Yeah, she was trying to save me

697
00:29:10,988 --> 00:29:12,776
from an unnecessary surgery.

698
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,234
She made a mistake.

699
00:29:17,268 --> 00:29:18,702
Is that what you're saying?

700
00:29:19,285 --> 00:29:20,804
Had you had the surgery...

701
00:29:20,838 --> 00:29:23,173
I wouldn't be raw hamburger right now?

702
00:29:28,222 --> 00:29:29,846
Okay. So you're mad at her, hmm?

703
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:32,282
Okay, I'm sorry, I...

704
00:29:34,118 --> 00:29:36,753
I didn't mean for you...
That was unprofessional of me.

705
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:37,754
I apologize.

706
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:39,423
Okay. So...

707
00:29:39,457 --> 00:29:40,691
Spill.

708
00:29:41,304 --> 00:29:43,393
Come on. Give me the goods.

709
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:45,862
Tell me the dirt, tell me the skinny.

710
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:47,731
Dr. Kepner.

711
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:51,802
You really think I can't tell
when someone's in pain, too?

712
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:55,238
That's not...

713
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:57,607
You don't have to worry about that...

714
00:29:57,642 --> 00:30:00,377
So, what, I should worry
about my wife not getting here

715
00:30:00,411 --> 00:30:01,411
before I pass out?

716
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:02,645
Or the fact that my skin

717
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:04,881
is giving up being actual,
you know, skin?

718
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,516
I can give you morphine and...

719
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:08,452
No, no, listen, listen, the Talmud says

720
00:30:08,486 --> 00:30:10,554
if someone is sick or in need

721
00:30:10,588 --> 00:30:13,724
and you can take away
1/60th of their pain,

722
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:16,059
then that's goodness. That's God.

723
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:20,386
You can't take away a 60th of something

724
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,265
if you don't know what it is.

725
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,633
That's not your job.

726
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:25,602
It is exactly my job,

727
00:30:25,636 --> 00:30:28,038
and I prefer to do it
till the bitter end.

728
00:30:28,072 --> 00:30:31,208
Come on. You're not gonna deny
a dying man's wish?

729
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:34,478
- You're not...
- Aren't I?

730
00:30:34,512 --> 00:30:38,615
Dr. Kepner, I've held enough
dying men's hands in my career.

731
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:41,385
I know it's mine this time.

732
00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:44,710
I am sorry, Eli.

733
00:30:44,744 --> 00:30:46,351
Don't be sorry. You're doing your job.

734
00:30:46,351 --> 00:30:48,725
Just let me do mine.

735
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:50,961
I'm not...

736
00:30:50,995 --> 00:30:52,329
I...

737
00:30:52,363 --> 00:30:54,064
I'm fine.

738
00:30:54,098 --> 00:30:55,832
I don't... I don't need anything.

739
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:57,601
What?

740
00:30:57,635 --> 00:30:59,436
You're a terrible liar. I like that.

741
00:31:02,969 --> 00:31:04,441
All right, fine.

742
00:31:04,475 --> 00:31:05,842
What's that saying?

743
00:31:05,877 --> 00:31:08,578
"If... If I'm not for myself,
who will be for me?"

744
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:10,293
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I am

745
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:12,482
taking care of myself, for once.
That's all.

746
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:13,782
Oh, and you realize that that phrase

747
00:31:13,816 --> 00:31:15,852
is not an invitation
for narcissism, right?

748
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:17,621
You're calling me a narcissist?

749
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:19,289
Sure you don't want more pain meds?

750
00:31:19,323 --> 00:31:21,124
- It'll knock you right out.
- I don't blame you.

751
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:22,259
You know, it's human nature.

752
00:31:22,293 --> 00:31:25,462
You face enough hardship,
then you can't help but think

753
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:26,863
that you're being punished,

754
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:28,965
that you did something to deserve it.

755
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,667
I did nothing to deserve...

756
00:31:35,706 --> 00:31:39,476
Okay. My whole life,
I followed His rules.

757
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,878
I studied, I believed,

758
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:43,513
I practiced what I preached.

759
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:46,616
I did every single thing He asked of me.

760
00:31:46,651 --> 00:31:49,786
And that guarantees you... what?

761
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:51,621
Excuse me?

762
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:53,523
Well, where... where...
where is the guarantee?

763
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:55,358
In the sequel? 'Cause, I have to admit,

764
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:56,611
I'm not as up on that as I used to be.

765
00:31:56,645 --> 00:31:58,061
If by the sequel,
you mean the New Testament,

766
00:31:58,095 --> 00:31:59,196
- that's pretty funny.
- No, no, where...

767
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,398
where is it written exactly
that if you do this or that,

768
00:32:01,432 --> 00:32:03,818
that everything in your life's
gonna be good, hmm?

769
00:32:03,852 --> 00:32:06,736
Nowhere, in any faith,
is there a guarantee.

770
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:10,173
I'm not asking for everything
to be good all the time.

771
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,908
- But fair... I think that I...
- Fair?

772
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:13,710
Was it fair when Isaac went blind

773
00:32:13,744 --> 00:32:15,212
and then his child betrayed him?

774
00:32:15,246 --> 00:32:17,714
And where was the fairness
when Sara had to wait 99 years

775
00:32:17,748 --> 00:32:20,250
before she had a child,
and God said, "Sacrifice him"?

776
00:32:20,284 --> 00:32:22,385
And Moses couldn't even get
past the bouncer

777
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,472
to the Promised Land.

778
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:24,921
And like I said,
I'm not up on the sequel,

779
00:32:24,956 --> 00:32:27,324
but from what I hear,
Jesus got a raw deal.

780
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:29,659
- Oh, I...
- Nobody in the Bible

781
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:33,163
lived a life free of suffering
or injustice,

782
00:32:33,197 --> 00:32:34,831
or it wouldn't have been a best seller.

783
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:36,666
And if they lived lives like that,

784
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:39,703
why should ours be diff... different?

785
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:42,272
Here we go.

786
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:49,880
Now, if people only believed
in God when things were good,

787
00:32:49,914 --> 00:32:52,415
I guarantee you, after the Holocaust,

788
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,217
not a single Jew would be a believer.

789
00:32:54,252 --> 00:32:55,852
Okay.

790
00:32:55,887 --> 00:32:57,921
Well, see, now you mention the Holocaust,

791
00:32:57,955 --> 00:32:59,589
and anything I say after that makes me...

792
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:00,757
A narcissist?

793
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,926
I was gonna say jackass, but...

794
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,594
Okay, come on.

795
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:06,229
Deep breath. Please, deep breath.

796
00:33:06,264 --> 00:33:08,265
There you go.

797
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:10,767
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

798
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:15,935
Faith wouldn't be real faith...

799
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:19,209
if you only believe when things are good.

800
00:33:23,414 --> 00:33:26,249
Well, so, what?

801
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:28,919
The world is just cruel and random,

802
00:33:28,953 --> 00:33:30,987
and there's nothing
anyone can do about it?

803
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:33,456
Look, I don't have a lot of time here.
Do you mind if I just skip to the part

804
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:35,325
where I pretend I don't know
what to tell you?

805
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,566
I'm just gonna tell you, okay?

806
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,161
- Okay.
- You sound like a child.

807
00:33:38,195 --> 00:33:40,163
- What?
- Terrible things happen.

808
00:33:40,197 --> 00:33:43,900
Terrible, wonderful,
devastating things happen.

809
00:33:43,935 --> 00:33:45,669
Who the hell are you to know why?

810
00:33:45,703 --> 00:33:48,805
Who are you to know why some people live

811
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,273
and some people die?

812
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:51,575
Children die.

813
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:53,677
Children who didn't do anything wrong,

814
00:33:53,711 --> 00:33:55,745
children... who were broken

815
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,681
before they had a chance to be whole,

816
00:33:57,715 --> 00:33:59,616
who were climbing
in their own front windows.

817
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,958
Right. And you don't get to know
why any more than...

818
00:34:02,992 --> 00:34:05,855
than I get to know why I'm dying

819
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,857
from taking a pill that saves lives,

820
00:34:07,892 --> 00:34:11,361
that saves... nearly everyone's life...

821
00:34:11,395 --> 00:34:13,163
but it's killing me.

822
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:17,167
So you can either
believe in God and goodness,

823
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:19,336
or you can believe
it's pointless, it's cruel,

824
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,792
and it's random...

825
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,275
whatever makes you happier.

826
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:27,844
Are you?

827
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:29,646
Happy?

828
00:34:35,386 --> 00:34:37,354
It's not narcissism.

829
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:38,688
Then what is it?

830
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:41,825
Pain.

831
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:46,818
Unimaginable pain.

832
00:34:48,265 --> 00:34:50,166
Yeah, I know the feeling.

833
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,331
God's not indifferent to our pain.

834
00:35:03,914 --> 00:35:05,348
Listen, tikkun olam.

835
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:07,417
Tikkun olam means...

836
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:11,855
...that the world
is full of brokenness...

837
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,825
and it's our job to put it
back together again.

838
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,194
It assumes...

839
00:35:18,558 --> 00:35:20,664
that the world...

840
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:27,650
...is, uh, broken
and in need and in pain.

841
00:35:30,574 --> 00:35:32,530
And it's our job...

842
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:36,346
to fix... f-fix it.

843
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,116
Eli, let me... let me
give you some more morphine.

844
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:43,253
I can... I can take away the pain.

845
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:46,856
1/60th of your pain. I can do that.

846
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:48,792
Please... let me.

847
00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:51,461
You already did.

848
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:57,901
Oh, and listen... tell...

849
00:35:57,935 --> 00:35:59,736
Will you tell Dr. Bailey I forgive her?

850
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,137
Okay? You'll... You'll tell.

851
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:02,706
You'll tell her, right?

852
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,874
Eli... Eli, no.

853
00:36:04,909 --> 00:36:06,876
You have to hang on
just a little bit longer.

854
00:36:06,911 --> 00:36:08,978
Elyse is on her way. She's on her way.

855
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:10,280
Elyse? Elyse is here?

856
00:36:10,314 --> 00:36:11,948
She'll be here any minute.

857
00:36:14,618 --> 00:36:16,282
Elyse.

858
00:36:18,255 --> 00:36:19,823
I... I love you...

859
00:36:19,857 --> 00:36:20,890
Okay.

860
00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:22,292
Okay, Eli.

861
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:23,793
Okay.

862
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:26,096
Oh, Elyse.

863
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:29,733
Eli, I'm here.

864
00:36:30,463 --> 00:36:31,968
I love you.

865
00:36:32,002 --> 00:36:33,403
I'm right here.

866
00:36:33,437 --> 00:36:35,672
I love... I love...

867
00:36:44,048 --> 00:36:45,849
Oh.

868
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:52,889
Oh.

869
00:37:15,285 --> 00:37:17,186
What's the word, Dr. Grey?

870
00:37:19,355 --> 00:37:22,224
You taking the front of the
canoe or you taking the back?

871
00:37:22,258 --> 00:37:24,927
You making room for me
in that hammock of yours?

872
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,764
Sorry, Nick.

873
00:37:28,798 --> 00:37:32,000
Plan B is... is never gonna happen.

874
00:37:35,705 --> 00:37:37,573
Because I saved your kidney.

875
00:37:37,607 --> 00:37:39,508
Pbht! You are...

876
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:41,276
Oh, my God. You are evil.

877
00:37:43,046 --> 00:37:44,413
An evil, twisted...

878
00:37:44,447 --> 00:37:45,481
Genius.

879
00:37:45,515 --> 00:37:47,031
Genius.

880
00:37:47,066 --> 00:37:48,283
You are.

881
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:50,252
You saved my life.

882
00:37:50,286 --> 00:37:51,487
I did.

883
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:54,957
Saved my whole damn life.

884
00:38:00,396 --> 00:38:03,432
Teddy... Teddy, you're blowing
this way out of proportion!

885
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:05,134
I came here because I love you!

886
00:38:05,168 --> 00:38:07,035
You came here because
your marriage is over,

887
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,504
and you're terrified of being alone!

888
00:38:08,538 --> 00:38:10,139
- I'm not terrified...
- Oh, please!

889
00:38:10,173 --> 00:38:11,707
You leave Beth for Cristina,

890
00:38:11,741 --> 00:38:14,643
and then Cristina
for some random woman in a bar,

891
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:16,345
and then you go back to Cristina,

892
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:18,947
and then you go to Amelia
to soothe your pathological need

893
00:38:18,982 --> 00:38:20,682
to be coupled up so that no one sees

894
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:22,822
- how sad and empty you are!
- You're the one who's scared.

895
00:38:22,857 --> 00:38:25,454
- I'm not scared!
- You always have been.

896
00:38:25,488 --> 00:38:27,856
Deep down, you're terrified
to be... be happy.

897
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:29,725
I mean, sure, you're fine
to marry the dead guy,

898
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:31,293
but when you have love... real love...

899
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:32,161
staring you in the face, you run!

900
00:38:32,195 --> 00:38:34,329
You don't ever get to talk about Henry.

901
00:38:34,364 --> 00:38:35,630
Do you understand me?

902
00:38:36,964 --> 00:38:38,834
I am not scared.

903
00:38:38,868 --> 00:38:41,303
Please, it's what you do.
It's what you've always done.

904
00:38:41,337 --> 00:38:43,504
It's the reason you can't make
a real relationship work.

905
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:46,556
You'd rather burn it all to
the ground than risk being hurt!

906
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,011
Maybe because all you ever do
is hurt me, Owen!

907
00:38:49,045 --> 00:38:51,847
You string me along for years

908
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:53,415
with these half-baked declarations,

909
00:38:53,449 --> 00:38:54,706
and then you marry other women.

910
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,419
And then you fly halfway across
the world to my doorstep,

911
00:38:57,453 --> 00:38:59,421
and you convince me that this is real,

912
00:38:59,455 --> 00:39:00,721
that you're in this with me,

913
00:39:00,746 --> 00:39:02,916
that you love me, that you want me!

914
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:06,495
And it has never, ever,
ever been about me!

915
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:08,096
I do love you!

916
00:39:08,131 --> 00:39:09,231
I want you.

917
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:11,667
And then, when you have me,
when you really have me,

918
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:13,438
and you have me believing
that you mean it,

919
00:39:13,473 --> 00:39:15,671
I find out that 24 hours earlier,

920
00:39:15,705 --> 00:39:18,674
your ex-wife, who you just
screwed, told you to!

921
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:21,343
I am done being your fallback.

922
00:39:21,377 --> 00:39:23,679
I am done being your damn sloppy seconds.

923
00:39:23,713 --> 00:39:25,781
I'm not your consolation prize!

924
00:39:25,815 --> 00:39:27,441
Teddy, please. Please, Teddy,

925
00:39:27,476 --> 00:39:30,101
just look at me... look at me. Please.

926
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,355
Don't do this.

927
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:40,444
You know, the snow?

928
00:39:41,097 --> 00:39:44,233
It wasn't for the soldiers.
It was for you.

929
00:39:44,267 --> 00:39:45,901
I did it for you.

930
00:39:45,935 --> 00:39:47,196
I just knew you loved Christmas,

931
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:50,430
and I, uh... I just wanted, uh...

932
00:39:52,621 --> 00:39:54,756
I did it for you.

933
00:39:57,914 --> 00:40:00,115
I'm done, Owen. We're done.

934
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,454
24 hours.

935
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:08,390
1,440 minutes.

936
00:40:08,424 --> 00:40:11,026
86,400 seconds.

937
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,928
That all it takes.

938
00:40:12,962 --> 00:40:17,399
To save your life, change your life.

939
00:41:25,702 --> 00:41:27,636
Eli forgave you.

940
00:41:31,174 --> 00:41:34,943
Some things just... happen,

941
00:41:34,978 --> 00:41:38,180
and we don't get to know why.

942
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:52,027
One single day can pull
us from the depths of despair.

943
00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:01,370
- Hey.
- Oh!

944
00:42:01,404 --> 00:42:02,404
You look like crap.

945
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:03,706
I do not.

946
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,173
Long day?

947
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,639
I saved a transplant surgeon today.

948
00:42:07,674 --> 00:42:09,211
Mm.

949
00:42:10,913 --> 00:42:15,083
He was smart and funny.

950
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:16,184
And?

951
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:17,219
Hot.

952
00:42:17,253 --> 00:42:18,720
And, so, what? He's married?

953
00:42:18,755 --> 00:42:19,888
Nope.

954
00:42:19,922 --> 00:42:22,090
- Gay?
- Lives in a foreign country?

955
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,558
Minnesota.

956
00:42:23,593 --> 00:42:24,426
Same difference.

957
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,561
So what's the problem?

958
00:42:27,864 --> 00:42:30,599
No problem. He was just my patient.

959
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:32,934
So he's smart, funny, and hot, and...

960
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:34,243
My patient.

961
00:42:35,998 --> 00:42:38,373
I really like the way my life is now.

962
00:42:38,408 --> 00:42:39,665
I just...

963
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:44,012
He made me feel something that
I haven't felt since Derek.

964
00:42:44,047 --> 00:42:47,616
But... you're his doctor.

965
00:42:50,086 --> 00:42:52,454
Is it really the worst thing
in the world,

966
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:55,524
knowing it's out there if you want it?

967
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:57,808
No, it's not the worst thing.

968
00:42:59,495 --> 00:43:01,096
And one single day

969
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,432
can fill us with more possibilities

970
00:43:03,466 --> 00:43:06,297
than we could imagine.

971
00:43:06,331 --> 00:43:14,366

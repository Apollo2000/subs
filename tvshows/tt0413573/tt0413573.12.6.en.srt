1
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:06,544
According to this man's
family, he was not a smoker.

2
00:00:06,588 --> 00:00:09,389
But the truth is, he smoked two packs a day

3
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:10,889
in his car for 20 years

4
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:12,958
while his wife and children slept.

5
00:00:12,993 --> 00:00:16,129
Sometimes the patient's shame
is the elephant in the room.

6
00:00:16,163 --> 00:00:17,796
They try to hide it from us.

7
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:19,298
But you can't hide from a surgeon,

8
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,633
because the body doesn't lie.

9
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:23,769
The truth is right here,
for everyone to see.

10
00:00:23,803 --> 00:00:27,705
And it doesn't need to say a single word.

11
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:35,013
So, uh... Deluca and I are
basically not talking.

12
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:38,250
Just like you two.

13
00:00:38,284 --> 00:00:39,618
Only different.

14
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:41,620
Obviously.

15
00:00:45,423 --> 00:00:46,757
Yeah, I mean, we say "hi,"

16
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:49,393
but, uh... There's no talking.

17
00:00:49,427 --> 00:00:52,796
I mean, after the amazing sex.

18
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:56,233
Once you've had that,

19
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:59,736
you would think it would be
easier to have a conversation.

20
00:01:06,644 --> 00:01:08,144
So...

21
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:10,746
That woman starts today...
the resident from Dillard.

22
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:12,848
Do you want to talk about that?

23
00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:14,817
'Cause you should.

24
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:20,722
It doesn't burn when I pee anymore.

25
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:38,429
It's your first day. H-how do you... how...

26
00:01:38,454 --> 00:01:40,808
It's okay.

27
00:01:40,842 --> 00:01:42,310
You don't have to do that.

28
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:55,755
Hi.

29
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:58,325
Can you guys tell me how to
find out whose service I'm on?

30
00:01:59,493 --> 00:02:00,827
I mean, which attending?

31
00:02:00,861 --> 00:02:02,395
You should ask her.

32
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,865
I'm probably not qualified to answer that.

33
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:07,867
Just check your e-mail.

34
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:11,503
Thank you.

35
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:13,672
As you know, transfer residents

36
00:02:13,707 --> 00:02:15,341
traditionally do their first rotation

37
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,543
with the chief of general
surgery, which is you,

38
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:20,346
and, as you also know, our newest transfer,

39
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,749
Penelope Blake, is starting today.

40
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:27,752
So... you understand how this...
could have happened...

41
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:29,053
What is "this"?

42
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:31,822
Dr. Blake is on your service.

43
00:02:31,857 --> 00:02:36,193
However, um, Dr. Webber
has offered to take over.

44
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:38,496
Or I can. You just say the word.

45
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,030
I'll take Blake.

46
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:41,198
You don't have to.

47
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,567
I'm chief of general. It's the job.

48
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:45,402
You sure?

49
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:47,738
Of course. I'll do it.

50
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:49,506
Uh...

51
00:02:59,216 --> 00:03:01,384
uh, s-sir? Sir, y-you can't park there.

52
00:03:01,418 --> 00:03:03,386
Oh, no, I'm not parking. I'm
just stopping for a sec.

53
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,287
No, this is for patients only.

54
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:05,888
Yeah, yeah, I got a patient. No worries.

55
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:08,991
All righty.

56
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,729
Well, we're a little late, but we're here.

57
00:03:13,764 --> 00:03:15,731
You ready for this?

58
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:16,532
Yeah.

59
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:18,600
Did this case a year ago.

60
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:19,768
Looks amazing.

61
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:22,069
- And we're doing something like this again today?
- Yeah.

62
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:26,308
April's bringing in a kid from
Jordan with Ollier's disease.

63
00:03:26,342 --> 00:03:27,575
You can see, these are the enchondromas.

64
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,810
Cartilaginous tumors.

65
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:31,045
- They... they grow from the growth plates, right?
- Exactly.

66
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,481
Which is why you're gonna want
to do a wide local excision,

67
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:34,981
expose the bone so I can get in there

68
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:36,283
and reconstruct the hand...

69
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,085
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I will?

70
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,887
I'll dissect the tumors?

71
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:42,556
I thought so.

72
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,791
If you're up for it.

73
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:45,826
Hell yes, I am.

74
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,928
Are you ready? They're on their way up.

75
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,798
Uh, why don't you head up to
Peds, help him get settled?

76
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:52,298
Yeah.

77
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,737
Thank you for doing this.

78
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,406
Listen, it's a great case.
And it's just a resection.

79
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,007
He's such a sweet kid.

80
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,810
He's an amazing kid.

81
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,345
He's been through hell in Jordan,

82
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,180
and... and he just never gives up.

83
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,948
Since he lost his family, he's
been living at the hospital,

84
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:11,783
and we just... we give him all
these odd jobs to do and...

85
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,518
April, you can stop selling him.

86
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,320
Okay? It's happening.

87
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,088
We are doing it, so...

88
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,792
Good. Just... I just...

89
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,927
Thanks for putting our stuff aside, and...

90
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,830
Let's go see him.

91
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:37,875
Yes.

92
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:39,510
I am...

93
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:42,012
I understand I'm on your service today.

94
00:04:42,046 --> 00:04:43,880
That's right.

95
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:45,882
D-Dr. Grey, I just want to say,

96
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,852
I don't want today to be
awkward or uncomfortable.

97
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:50,152
So don't make it awkward
or uncomfortable...

98
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:51,187
like this, right now.

99
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:54,891
If there's anything that I...

100
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:56,860
Consult in the pit. We're walking.

101
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:05,133
Robert Matthews, 30s, fell
down two flights of stairs.

102
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:06,402
Possible L.O.C.

103
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:07,870
He's been complaining of abdominal pain.

104
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:09,905
I can arrange for a head C.T.
or page neuro.

105
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,973
All I need is an ultrasound.

106
00:05:15,678 --> 00:05:16,844
No! Oh!

107
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,312
Whoa, whoa! Calm down. Okay.

108
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:20,314
No, I-I have to go!

109
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:21,682
Okay.

110
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:24,051
Relax!

111
00:05:24,085 --> 00:05:27,755
I did something bad... really bad...
and I...

112
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,890
Where am I?

113
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:29,990
How'd I get here?

114
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:31,358
Relax. You fell down some stairs.

115
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:33,760
I was trying to get up to the choir loft.

116
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:34,795
Choir loft?

117
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:37,230
I'm the pastor at first
Lutheran, and I had...

118
00:05:37,264 --> 00:05:38,398
there was an accident.

119
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:40,567
I accidentally...

120
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:42,068
Oh, god. I have to go!

121
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:43,002
Hey.

122
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:44,504
Okay, listen, Robert,
you have to calm down,

123
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:46,005
or you're gonna make this worse, okay?

124
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,941
It's not okay!

125
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:49,375
I sent it to everyone.

126
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,676
Sent what?

127
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,377
The church bulletin.

128
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:54,747
I went to attach the video of
the youth volleyball game,

129
00:05:54,781 --> 00:05:58,684
and... I've been seeing someone...
a woman...

130
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:01,687
a nice, but... sort of adventurous woman.

131
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:03,255
But nice and...

132
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:04,356
okay, now you lost me.

133
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,892
I attached the wrong video.

134
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,030
You sent a sex tape?

135
00:06:13,065 --> 00:06:14,365
To my entire congregation.

136
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,701
Oh, good god!

137
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:19,626
Yeah, can we not talk about him right now?

138
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,336
I rode on a bus, a train, a plane,

139
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,670
three cars, and a helicopter.

140
00:06:24,705 --> 00:06:25,971
That's amazing!

141
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:29,342
Um, Kamal, I want you to meet Dr. Avery.

142
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:31,244
- He's gonna perform your operation.
- Hi.

143
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:33,479
You are... the guy?

144
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:36,148
"The guy"? Um...

145
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:38,484
There she is! The machine!

146
00:06:38,518 --> 00:06:39,852
Nathan!

147
00:06:39,886 --> 00:06:42,186
- Hey.
- Oh, man! Hey!

148
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:44,922
Thank you, thank you, thank
you for bringing him here.

149
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:45,923
Hey, come on. Of course.

150
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,760
Nathan and I worked
together on my last tour.

151
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:52,330
- Dr. Riggs, this is Jackson... Dr. Avery.
- Oh.

152
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:53,732
- Yeah, Nathan Riggs.
- Hey.

153
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:54,532
- Hey.
- Trauma surgeon?

154
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:56,534
Cardiothoracic, but over there,

155
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:58,369
it's pretty much all trauma, you know?

156
00:06:58,403 --> 00:07:00,504
Sure. Sure, yeah.

157
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:02,939
Dr. Riggs! He is the guy!

158
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:05,208
What is "the guy"?

159
00:07:05,243 --> 00:07:06,310
The first time we met Kamal,

160
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:08,445
Keps said, "I know the guy
who can fix your hands,"

161
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,681
so ever since, he's been talking
about meeting "the guy."

162
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:14,718
Well, Kamal, let's take a look, huh?

163
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:22,858
Ohh.

164
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:27,697
Okay. Let's get this guy up here.

165
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:29,999
All right. Look at this.

166
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:34,936
Okay.

167
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:40,842
Uh-huh.

168
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:45,880
You can fix them?

169
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:51,018
That's the plan.

170
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:56,791
You never told me it was this advanced.

171
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:58,459
The tumors are massive.

172
00:07:58,493 --> 00:07:59,427
Okay, maybe I downplayed it a little.

173
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:00,528
You downplayed it?! This looks impossible!

174
00:08:00,562 --> 00:08:03,397
I don't understand. You
sent him the scans, right?

175
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:05,032
Didn't you see the scans?

176
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:08,802
She told me the scans were lost in Jordan.

177
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:09,902
I didn't want him to see the scans.

178
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:10,903
Wait. What?

179
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:12,104
Keps, what the hell?!

180
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:13,573
You lied!

181
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:15,107
If you had seen the scans,
you might have said no,

182
00:08:15,142 --> 00:08:17,910
and I wanted you to meet that little boy.

183
00:08:17,945 --> 00:08:19,512
And he's here now.

184
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:20,947
So how do we help him?

185
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:29,898

186
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:34,925
Hey. So, Blake's on Meredith's service?

187
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:35,792
Uh, looks like it.

188
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:37,361
- She gonna be all right?
- I don't know.

189
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:38,562
We haven't spoken since the party.

190
00:08:38,595 --> 00:08:39,762
She feels like I'm on Meredith's side.

191
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:40,796
And I am, you know?

192
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:41,898
But it doesn't mean I'm
not on penny's side, too.

193
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:45,434
And now Meredith's not even
talking to me, so win-win!

194
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:48,404
Oh, god.

195
00:08:48,438 --> 00:08:50,439
78 new messages?

196
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:54,376
They know.

197
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:55,977
They all know.

198
00:08:57,914 --> 00:09:00,015
What's your assessment?

199
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,483
Well, I think... not you... Blake.

200
00:09:02,651 --> 00:09:04,419
Ultrasound showed fluid in Morison's pouch.

201
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:05,719
We should get an abdominal C.T.

202
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,688
And what are we looking for on the C.T.?

203
00:09:07,722 --> 00:09:10,191
We need to rule out bleeding
from the liver or the spleen.

204
00:09:10,225 --> 00:09:11,859
We should also evaluate the
retroperitoneal space.

205
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:13,627
If there's active bleeding on the C.T.,

206
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:15,096
we set him up for an ex-lap.

207
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,431
Are you forgetting anything?

208
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:18,899
Uh, we cleared his c-spine,

209
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,634
we sent blood out for a
trauma panel, tox screen,

210
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:23,570
alcohol levels.

211
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,705
And?

212
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:26,873
And, uh...

213
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:28,241
Order a type and crossmatch.

214
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,444
Oh. Of course.

215
00:09:30,478 --> 00:09:32,579
Obviously. I-I skipped that.

216
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,114
Okay, well, let's not skip steps.

217
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:35,815
We're a level I trauma center.

218
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:37,483
I need to know what Dillard taught you.

219
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:40,719
Let's fill him with fluids
and prep him for a C.T.

220
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:45,657
I didn't lie. I...

221
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:47,159
You bent the truth... a bit.

222
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:48,727
Until it broke.

223
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:50,662
It was a good lie.

224
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:52,631
Okay, it was a bad lie,
but for a good reason.

225
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:54,499
You know, you haven't been
saying yes to anything lately...

226
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:55,600
not when it comes from me.

227
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:57,569
Look at the scans, April.

228
00:09:57,603 --> 00:10:00,338
Okay, these areas are
pure cartilage, right?

229
00:10:00,372 --> 00:10:02,173
They probably destroyed any
bone that was in their path.

230
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,408
Guys, we don't even know

231
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:05,643
there's anything resembling
hands underneath these things.

232
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:07,645
Can you even repair the tendons
and the neurovascular bundles?

233
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,679
That's doubtful.

234
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:10,581
Well, Hopkins and Case
Western did similar cases.

235
00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:12,316
They... they reconstructed
using bone grafts.

236
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,617
Oh, so have I, and you know those cases

237
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:14,851
are nothing compared to Kamal's.

238
00:10:14,885 --> 00:10:16,120
April, he's saying no.

239
00:10:16,154 --> 00:10:18,755
Look, we'll just keep looking
until we find someone.

240
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:21,658
And they will all say the exact same thing.

241
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:24,261
Thanks.

242
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:26,330
Thanks for taking the time.

243
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:30,333
Look, I'm not saying no.

244
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:34,003
I'm saying I... will do some biopsies

245
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:35,938
so that we can all get a full picture

246
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:37,706
of what it is we're dealing with here.

247
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,109
Thank you.

248
00:10:43,713 --> 00:10:47,616
I heard there was a bad
driver in the house.

249
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,251
Uncle Richard!

250
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:54,789
Man, you look... Bald.

251
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:56,691
And you look old.

252
00:10:57,793 --> 00:10:59,361
"Uncle Richard"?

253
00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:02,329
Yeah, Adele and I knew Paul
and his late wife, Lois,

254
00:11:02,364 --> 00:11:03,664
before we got married.

255
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:04,865
Bumpy and I go way back.

256
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:07,268
"Bumpy"? Why "Bumpy"?

257
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:09,036
Uh... Hey.

258
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,103
Morning, Angela.

259
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,439
Uh...

260
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:14,141
Tell me about the accident.

261
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:15,643
How did it happen?

262
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:17,511
All I know is I pressed the brake,

263
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:18,978
but the damn car kept going.

264
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,112
Right into a tree.

265
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:24,551
Yeah, she's got a severely
displaced clavicular fracture

266
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:27,387
and a weak pulse in her right arm.

267
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:28,354
How about Paul?

268
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,690
I'll be fine. Angela got the worst of it.

269
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,559
Still, I want to work you
up, too, just to be safe.

270
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:34,694
So I'll go ahead and schedule that C.T.A.

271
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,461
That sound good to you, Bumpy?

272
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,397
That'll be quite enough of that.

273
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,531
Sorry.

274
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,333
Dr. Bumpy.

275
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,676
Tell me what you see.

276
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,310
Retroperitoneal fluid.

277
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,645
Around what? Be specific.

278
00:11:58,684 --> 00:11:59,783
The right kidney.

279
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:03,754
It's a grade IV injury with
an active extravasation.

280
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:06,557
We are gonna need to do an ex-lap.

281
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,092
Should I call upstairs?

282
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:10,694
What do we have?

283
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:13,930
Uh, patient came in with a
head lac, G.C.S. of 14,

284
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:15,498
loss of consciousness at the scene...

285
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:16,366
can you clear the head C.T.

286
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,568
So we can take him up for an ex-lap?

287
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:21,671
There's no shift, contusion, or bleed.

288
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:23,172
It's a mild concussion.

289
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:25,609
I'll do a quick exam, but
he's cleared for surgery.

290
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:28,244
Is this the pastor who
gave his congregation

291
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:30,412
a, uh... special blessing?

292
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:32,381
Word travels fast.

293
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:33,382
All around the hospital.

294
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,218
Yeah, I bet the pews
will be full on Sunday.

295
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:43,258
Monitor for any neurodeficits.

296
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:45,693
I will do another check, post-op.

297
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:47,428
Blake, get him ready for transport.

298
00:12:47,463 --> 00:12:49,196
Edwards, show her where it is.

299
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:03,644
It's not enough to have her
here in the same building.

300
00:13:03,678 --> 00:13:05,646
You invited her on your service, too?

301
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,614
I am trying to rise above.

302
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:09,549
And you should, too.

303
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:12,919
No, you should have ended it that night.

304
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:16,556
Forget it.

305
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:18,857
It was better when we weren't talking.

306
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,333
As I feared, the biopsy showed
precancerous cells in the tumor.

307
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:28,634
Both sides.

308
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,737
- Okay. Then we need to get in there A.S.A.P.
- April, listen,

309
00:13:31,772 --> 00:13:34,673
there is no clear way to
excise all the tumor.

310
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:38,810
So I have to recommend... amputation.

311
00:13:38,844 --> 00:13:40,512
Of both hands.

312
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:41,646
No.

313
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:43,915
It is his best shot before
it progresses to cancer.

314
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,584
No. I brought him to you to save his hands.

315
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:48,152
This is how we save his life.

316
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:49,788
Well, I don't know.

317
00:13:49,822 --> 00:13:51,255
I don't see how he survives over there

318
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,956
with no hands and no one
to take care of him.

319
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,692
I understand. I'm sorry.

320
00:13:54,726 --> 00:13:56,860
I could have told you sooner
if I had all the information.

321
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:57,994
You mean you could have given up sooner.

322
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:00,197
Yes, you're right... because
there's nothing to be done.

323
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:01,465
You could try!

324
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:02,433
You could make an effort

325
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,601
instead of just giving up and walking away!

326
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,803
And you don't think I want to?

327
00:14:05,837 --> 00:14:06,804
All right, we're not doing this.

328
00:14:06,838 --> 00:14:08,705
Could you leave us alone
for a second, please?

329
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:09,706
Oh, absolutely, I'm gonna leave,

330
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,208
and I'm gonna take Kamal
with me, all right?

331
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:14,644
'Cause this isn't about you two! Okay?

332
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:17,780
This is about a little boy who
had to see his family murdered,

333
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,148
who saw his home burnt to the ground,

334
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:20,717
who would've been taken as a child soldier

335
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:22,685
if it wasn't for his deformed hands.

336
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,320
All right, he doesn't have the time

337
00:14:24,355 --> 00:14:26,688
for you guys to be working out your crap!

338
00:14:26,723 --> 00:14:28,557
He deserves the best care he can get,

339
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:30,191
and I'm gonna make sure he finds it.

340
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:34,195
Why'd you even bring him to me?

341
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,231
You saw the scans. You're a good surgeon.

342
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:37,499
You knew this was hopeless.

343
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:38,967
I wasn't hopeless.

344
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:40,869
I don't know why you are.

345
00:14:40,903 --> 00:14:43,838
Because there's nothing here to save.

346
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:54,297
What's the trickiest part
of a partial nephrectomy?

347
00:14:54,331 --> 00:14:56,967
Well, I think it's essential that...
not you... Blake.

348
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:58,501
Mobilizing the colon quickly

349
00:14:58,535 --> 00:15:00,002
to get adequate exposure of the kidney.

350
00:15:00,036 --> 00:15:00,970
By your third year,

351
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:02,337
you should know this
surgery inside and out.

352
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:03,639
- I do.
- Okay.

353
00:15:03,673 --> 00:15:05,407
So you are gonna walk me through this.

354
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:06,575
Your hands are my hands,

355
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,618
and my hands do not like making mistakes.

356
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:09,645
Are you ready?

357
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,246
I am. Yes, I'm ready.

358
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,815
With what? Because I have
nothing in my hands.

359
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:14,149
Right. Uh, 10 blade.

360
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:16,217
10 blade.

361
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,888
C.T.A. results showed an injury

362
00:15:19,922 --> 00:15:21,689
to an artery in Angela's chest.

363
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:23,525
She's on her way to pre-op now.

364
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,469
She doesn't want you to
worry, and neither do I.

365
00:15:26,494 --> 00:15:28,195
You sound just like Bumpy.

366
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,165
You have to tell me why
you call him "Bumpy."

367
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,567
Well, that's 'cause,

368
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:36,048
back in the day, when we were in college...

369
00:15:36,073 --> 00:15:38,171
Got your results back.

370
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,506
Oh, you hurt your foot?

371
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,507
No, no, it's fine.

372
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:43,276
It's... Pins and needles, is all.

373
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,612
It's... it's, uh... it's
just a little numb.

374
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:46,880
It'll go away.

375
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:50,115
I don't think it will... not by itself.

376
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,719
Your labs show elevated
Hemoglobin A1 C levels.

377
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:56,121
And your blood glucose level is very high.

378
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,189
You're diabetic.

379
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,692
But you already knew that.

380
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:03,295
Listen, Bumpy, I've been
taking better care of myself.

381
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,197
Angela doesn't know, and... and
I want us to keep it that way.

382
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,898
That pain in your foot?

383
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,299
It's a symptom, Paul.

384
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,101
It's called diabetic nerve pain.

385
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,071
It could be the reason
you crashed your car.

386
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,641
Are you saying I put my
baby in the hospital?

387
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,810
No. It was an accident.

388
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,445
She loves you. She'll understand.

389
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,646
Just tell her...

390
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,247
do you have any children, Richard?

391
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:29,252
Do you?

392
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:30,487
No. No, I don't.

393
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:33,824
So you don't know a damn thing.
You can't possibly understand.

394
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:35,726
Please, just...

395
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,128
just take care of my little
girl, and leave me be.

396
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:41,397
I'll let you know as soon
as Angela's out of surgery.

397
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:53,342
And now Jackson wants to amputate.

398
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:55,945
He won't even try. He said it was hopeless.

399
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,014
He... he asked me why I
even brought Kamal to him.

400
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:01,083
What?

401
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:02,985
Well? Why did you?

402
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:05,787
I mean, the scans were so bad,
you had to lie about them.

403
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:08,824
You lied about a little boy, April.

404
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:11,192
I'm s... what... what are you saying?

405
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:15,329
Nothing. Sorry.

406
00:17:15,363 --> 00:17:17,264
W...

407
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:20,668
I'm saying, I know what it's like

408
00:17:20,702 --> 00:17:22,536
when it feels like
everything's coming apart

409
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:26,707
and you need something to pull it together.

410
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:28,275
I just...

411
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:31,245
I know.

412
00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:37,216
Are you sure?

413
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:40,486
Well, maybe you can show them to Rogers.

414
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:42,388
Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

415
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:44,824
All right, call me back. Thanks, Charlie.

416
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:47,961
Riggs?

417
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:53,932
Hunt.

418
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:55,734
What are you doing here?

419
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:57,435
April Kepner and I met in Jordan.

420
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,371
I've been working with the
relief effort in Afghanistan...

421
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:01,439
yeah, yeah, yeah. What are you doing here?

422
00:18:01,474 --> 00:18:03,375
We have a patient with Ollier's disease.

423
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:05,077
Brought him in to your hand guy.

424
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:06,077
And then you're leaving.

425
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:07,211
Yeah, well, maybe a little sooner than I...

426
00:18:07,245 --> 00:18:10,314
I'm not asking you, Riggs. I'm telling you.

427
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:14,418
Nice catching up.

428
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:17,722
Incise gerota's fascia.

429
00:18:17,756 --> 00:18:20,357
Now identify and debride
devitalized tissue.

430
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,225
Go on.

431
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:24,527
U-um... cauterize cortical bleeders

432
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,130
and establish hemostasis before closure.

433
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:29,465
Now close using a running absorbable suture

434
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,533
to avoid post-op fistulas.

435
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,469
You can even reinforce
using an absorbable mesh.

436
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:36,139
Well, that's thinking ahead. I like that.

437
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:37,273
Dr. Grey, Dr. Blake.

438
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:40,275
I thought I'd stop in to see
how the first day was going.

439
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,311
Thank you, sir. It's been...

440
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:44,546
Blake has been dictating my surgical steps.

441
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,816
Great. How's she doing? Not too well.

442
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,450
If I had done what she just suggested,

443
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:51,754
the patient would have major
renal cortex bleeding.

444
00:18:51,788 --> 00:18:53,222
What did you miss?

445
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:55,224
I... what?

446
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:58,492
What did I do that you missed?

447
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:00,929
Uh, debride, hemostasis, close...

448
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:02,663
Come on. Figure it out.

449
00:19:02,698 --> 00:19:05,166
I was watching you. I didn't see.

450
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:07,268
Deluca, can you fill in the blanks?

451
00:19:07,302 --> 00:19:11,106
Um, Dr. Blake didn't tell
you to clamp the hilum.

452
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,907
Dr. Grey, the hilum is clamped.

453
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:15,442
It is, sir, because I clamped it on my own.

454
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,444
I didn't skip a step, and therefore,

455
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:19,579
the patient did not hemorrhage and die.

456
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:21,782
Blake, hand your suction to Deluca.

457
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:23,917
Dr. Grey, I know this procedure.

458
00:19:23,952 --> 00:19:25,685
You would've killed the patient, Blake.

459
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,421
If your hands had been my
hands on this patient,

460
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:29,456
he'd be dead.

461
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,457
It's that simple.

462
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:31,657
Step away from the table.

463
00:19:54,936 --> 00:19:56,236
What's wrong?

464
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:57,804
Dr. Grey is what's wrong.

465
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:00,006
I'm new.

466
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,840
And attendings are hard on residents.

467
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,342
I know that. It's how we learn.

468
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:06,578
And she should be hard on me.
She should be grilling me.

469
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:09,194
And I should be able to handle it.

470
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:12,178
But I let her in my head. I froze.

471
00:20:12,203 --> 00:20:15,086
I knew that surgery backwards and forwards.

472
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:16,587
Okay, I can talk to her.

473
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:18,089
No. Don't.

474
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:20,691
I'm sorry. I just...

475
00:20:20,726 --> 00:20:23,094
I will figure this out.

476
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,230
It's not your problem.

477
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:38,675
I sent the biopsies, the
scans to three other guys.

478
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:40,110
Any luck?

479
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:40,911
No.

480
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:43,280
Well, I'd like to have been wrong.

481
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:47,717
Hey, look, I'm sorry you
got pulled into this, man.

482
00:20:47,752 --> 00:20:48,785
April can be...

483
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,686
No, look, I know.

484
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,155
She's The Machine.

485
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:54,557
She's the... What?

486
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:57,726
Oh, that's what we call her over there...
"The Machine."

487
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:59,862
It never slows down, never
lets it get to her.

488
00:20:59,896 --> 00:21:02,165
Just makes everyone else
want to work harder.

489
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:06,201
When she decides on something,
nothing's gonna stop her.

490
00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:09,171
You can't call that one off.

491
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:11,173
No, that's true.

492
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:13,508
Thing is, she's usually right.

493
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:24,818
Go find out what Callie
Torres is doing right now.

494
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:34,495
Oh. Angela's surgery is over?

495
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:36,063
How... how'd it go?

496
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:38,432
Did a primary repair of
the subclavian artery.

497
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:39,266
It went very well.

498
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:40,833
You can tell your friend she's fine.

499
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:41,934
Maggie, uh...

500
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,703
About Paul...

501
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:46,572
you know, what he said about
my not having children...

502
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:48,341
Paul knew me with Adele, my wife...

503
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:51,411
I know. I know. It's...
it's awkward. Awful.

504
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:53,446
No, you don't have to say another word.
I get it.

505
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:54,714
Okay.

506
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:56,216
I just wanted to make sure...

507
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,885
Don't... say another word.

508
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:02,721
Are y-you...

509
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:05,757
No. No, no. Of course not. This
is, um, this is allergies.

510
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,691
Allergies?

511
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08,793
Can we please pretend that it's allergies?

512
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,695
Maggie, if I did something...

513
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,131
no, no. God, no.

514
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,765
You... you cheated on your wife.

515
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,901
Why should you admit that to your friend?

516
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,702
Who would that help?

517
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,605
Not you, not him.

518
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,274
And, you know, you don't owe me anything.

519
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:24,642
You and I, we're not...

520
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,810
I don't know what we are.

521
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,811
That's just the thing.

522
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,281
I don't exactly know how
to a-address you...

523
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,648
Yeah, you don't have to. But...

524
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:33,316
it's fine.

525
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,985
You have nothing to be ashamed of...
really.

526
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,254
But...

527
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,127
So, they would just be gone?

528
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,929
Both of them?

529
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,331
We would have to amputate them

530
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:52,668
right... right about here, at the wrist.

531
00:22:52,702 --> 00:22:54,836
You see?

532
00:22:54,871 --> 00:22:56,705
On both sides.

533
00:22:58,775 --> 00:23:00,809
Will I still carry things?

534
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:04,080
Well, let's talk about that, buddy.

535
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:13,020
You'll be here when I'm done?

536
00:23:13,055 --> 00:23:15,490
Yes. I promise.

537
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:17,292
You sure about this?

538
00:23:17,326 --> 00:23:19,494
Nope. Not even a little bit.

539
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,629
We'll have a soda waiting for you, okay?

540
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:28,302
Okay.

541
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:31,438
God.

542
00:23:32,907 --> 00:23:34,808
All right, guys, how we doing this?

543
00:23:34,842 --> 00:23:35,642
Doing what?

544
00:23:35,676 --> 00:23:37,211
I figure we'll just debulk the tumor

545
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:38,712
from the dorsal surface,
and you can show me

546
00:23:38,746 --> 00:23:40,980
what, if any, usable bone we can find.

547
00:23:41,014 --> 00:23:42,648
There's been a change of plans.

548
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:43,616
Yeah, judging by the scans,

549
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,119
I'm not sure there's anything at all.
I know.

550
00:23:46,153 --> 00:23:48,488
It just might end up being the
world's slowest amputation,

551
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:50,856
but... can't hurt to try.

552
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,492
Mm-hmm.

553
00:23:54,194 --> 00:23:56,328
But... you told Kamal that he wouldn't...

554
00:23:56,362 --> 00:23:57,762
We lied.

555
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,733
We had to. Didn't want to
get his hopes up again.

556
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:02,734
He's gonna try?

557
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:04,536
Mm-hmm.

558
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:07,705
You lied! To me!

559
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,575
It was a good lie. Come on.
It was a good lie.

560
00:24:11,611 --> 00:24:13,777
Oh, my god.

561
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:17,181
He's gonna try.

562
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:21,685
We need to talk.

563
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:22,919
What's wrong?

564
00:24:22,954 --> 00:24:25,722
I thought you were stepping up,
putting Blake on your service,

565
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:28,325
but what I saw in that O.R.
wasn't teaching.

566
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,493
She crapped out on a basic
surgical principle.

567
00:24:30,528 --> 00:24:32,028
You were hazing her.

568
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:35,165
If she cracks under the pressure
of an emergent surgery,

569
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:37,333
she does not belong in this program.

570
00:24:37,368 --> 00:24:39,502
Blake was at the top of
her class at Dillard.

571
00:24:39,537 --> 00:24:42,138
Her references were impeccable.
I checked them myself.

572
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,841
You checked?

573
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:48,343
So you knew where she was from?

574
00:24:48,378 --> 00:24:50,745
You checked her case record?

575
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,514
Her losses?

576
00:24:54,384 --> 00:24:56,051
Did you know that she...

577
00:24:56,085 --> 00:24:58,554
She was an excellent candidate.

578
00:24:58,588 --> 00:25:01,523
You were the only reason not to hire her.

579
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:05,759
And you didn't find that reason enough?

580
00:25:16,364 --> 00:25:18,799
Your labs are within normal limits.

581
00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:22,200
That's good news.

582
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:24,575
I'm on every website.

583
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:26,450
Got an e-mail from our bishop.

584
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:28,545
I'm fired.

585
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,713
Someone's threatening to bring me up

586
00:25:30,748 --> 00:25:34,083
on charges as a sexual predator.

587
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,618
I'm done.

588
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,688
We're supposed to be a community.

589
00:25:38,722 --> 00:25:41,379
I make one simple mistake,
and they destroyed me.

590
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:43,731
Put it away.

591
00:25:43,756 --> 00:25:46,228
My mother saw it.

592
00:25:46,263 --> 00:25:48,497
Her friends won't talk to her.

593
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:52,033
Everybody's trying to figure
out who the woman is,

594
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,981
as if it's any of their business.

595
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:55,692
Thank the lord, she's okay.

596
00:25:57,488 --> 00:25:59,231
At least her life isn't over, too.

597
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:01,497
Nothing is over.

598
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:04,658
It's different for us... the clergy.

599
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:08,363
People put their trust in us...
their faith.

600
00:26:10,715 --> 00:26:12,533
We break that trust, it stays broken.

601
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:15,059
I can't believe that.

602
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:17,698
You know who you are.

603
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:19,831
You can stand up to them
and have faith in that...

604
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:21,967
have faith in yourself.

605
00:26:24,676 --> 00:26:25,771
I have to believe that.

606
00:26:27,575 --> 00:26:29,517
They say he doesn't give you
more than you can handle.

607
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:32,434
You say that, actually.

608
00:26:33,311 --> 00:26:35,646
Yes, I do.

609
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:38,447
Ow.

610
00:26:39,883 --> 00:26:40,983
Are you okay?

611
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:42,451
My stomach.

612
00:26:50,827 --> 00:26:51,827
Nurse!

613
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,862
Coming!

614
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:56,998
There is a clot in his catheter.
His bladder's about to rupture.

615
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,334
I need a syringe with
some saline and heparin,

616
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,635
and page Dr. Grey... now!

617
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,370
Right away.

618
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:06,308
You're okay.

619
00:27:06,342 --> 00:27:08,677
Those nerves are going everywhere.

620
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,145
How do you build something from that?

621
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,683
Well, for what it's worth,

622
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,085
I think you were right about him.

623
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,420
He's good.

624
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:21,555
I know.

625
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,525
He's talking about divorce.

626
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,428
Well, you kind of saw that
coming, though, right?

627
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:29,529
He said "don't go." You went.

628
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:31,030
On some level...

629
00:27:31,064 --> 00:27:33,533
it's not gonna happen.
It's not what I want.

630
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:35,568
I don't believe it's what he wants.

631
00:27:36,537 --> 00:27:39,472
I know it's not what god wants from me.

632
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:44,611
We're looking at a kid
who's lost his family,

633
00:27:44,645 --> 00:27:46,411
his home...

634
00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:48,847
Might even lose his hands now.

635
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:51,049
Maybe god has more on his mind

636
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:54,185
than judging whether you
get a divorce or not.

637
00:27:55,821 --> 00:27:58,724
Don't you think he has bigger fish to fry?

638
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:03,193
I've got about 60% of
bone structure over here.

639
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:04,528
How's it going over there?

640
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:08,566
I only see free floating distal phalanges,

641
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,768
and some of them are eroded by tumor.

642
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:13,203
We're approaching the carpals...
or what's left of them.

643
00:28:13,238 --> 00:28:14,071
Mm.

644
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:16,274
I'm looking for metacarpals over here.

645
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:17,742
Do you see any viable bone at all?

646
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:19,442
Well, uh...

647
00:28:19,477 --> 00:28:20,377
Damn it.

648
00:28:20,411 --> 00:28:21,411
What? What is it? Tell me.

649
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:25,047
Jackson, I'm s... I'm sorry. I'm just...

650
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:26,883
There's nothing here. I...

651
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:28,551
No, no, no. Wait. Just wait one second.

652
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:30,420
Well, no. There's no bone to work with.

653
00:28:30,454 --> 00:28:32,389
I mean, lookit. Look right here.

654
00:28:32,423 --> 00:28:33,956
There's fingers, and then there's nothing.

655
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:35,625
I don't... come on. Come on.

656
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,458
Jackson, I think...

657
00:28:36,493 --> 00:28:37,626
just wait, okay?

658
00:28:37,661 --> 00:28:39,161
I think that you were right.

659
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:41,597
I don't want to be right, though. I just...

660
00:28:41,631 --> 00:28:43,565
Let's keep going, please, okay?

661
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,667
Yeah, of course.

662
00:28:47,704 --> 00:28:48,970
Put that down!

663
00:28:49,005 --> 00:28:50,839
We are working here!

664
00:28:50,873 --> 00:28:52,441
We're gonna keep going until we are sure

665
00:28:52,475 --> 00:28:53,508
that there is nothing left.

666
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:57,278
Now, do not pick that up
again unless I tell you to.

667
00:28:58,514 --> 00:28:59,747
Jackson?

668
00:28:59,782 --> 00:29:01,148
I'm sorry. I was just...

669
00:29:01,183 --> 00:29:03,184
No, no, no, Jackson, look right here. Look.

670
00:29:03,218 --> 00:29:05,152
I found something. I found lunate bone.

671
00:29:05,187 --> 00:29:07,455
This is good lunate bone.

672
00:29:09,725 --> 00:29:10,957
What happened?

673
00:29:10,991 --> 00:29:12,526
I think he clotted his Foley.

674
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,729
I've flushed it five times.
I can't get a new one in.

675
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,498
He's hypotensive.

676
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:21,635
Get me a 50 CC with a 14-gauge needle.

677
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:23,136
You got it. How did this happen?

678
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,671
I was doing a post-op check,

679
00:29:24,706 --> 00:29:26,673
and I saw that there was blood in his bag.

680
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:28,607
How long did it take for you to notice?

681
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,042
I don't... uh, we were talking...

682
00:29:30,076 --> 00:29:31,777
you realize if he goes into renal failure,

683
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,879
this will undo everything
we did in the O.R. today.

684
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:35,881
Dr. Grey, I didn't miss this. I caught it.

685
00:29:35,915 --> 00:29:37,015
It shouldn't have happened!

686
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:40,118
You froze in the O.R., you
screwed up his post-op care!

687
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:44,056
Is there any part of this job
that you can handle, Blake?

688
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,457
I...

689
00:29:47,993 --> 00:29:49,728
Get out. You're not touching this patient.

690
00:29:49,762 --> 00:29:51,563
You're off my service.

691
00:29:51,597 --> 00:29:52,731
Get out!

692
00:29:52,765 --> 00:29:54,432
Now!

693
00:29:57,436 --> 00:30:01,638
All right. The hamate bone's intact.

694
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:03,674
There's the trapezoid...

695
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:06,042
And...

696
00:30:06,077 --> 00:30:07,411
There's the scaphoid.

697
00:30:07,445 --> 00:30:09,546
That makes four good carpal bones.

698
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:10,714
Which is not much.

699
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:12,649
And almost no metacarpal.

700
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:15,018
But we'd have a base for
a proximal phalanx,

701
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:16,219
so that might regenerate.

702
00:30:16,254 --> 00:30:17,421
He is young, so...

703
00:30:17,455 --> 00:30:20,690
maybe we could sculpt the bone
and graft the gap in between?

704
00:30:20,724 --> 00:30:22,725
We could wire them with rib grafts.

705
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,827
I mean, then I could actually
make something out of that.

706
00:30:26,363 --> 00:30:28,731
Yes! Look! Look! That's a
fifth metacarpal head!

707
00:30:28,766 --> 00:30:30,700
Look! Right there!

708
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:32,001
That's a hand. That is what we needed.

709
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:34,036
Under there, that's... that is a hand!

710
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,570
We got a hand, people!

711
00:30:45,314 --> 00:30:46,515
Whew!

712
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:49,050
Oh, my god!

713
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:51,119
Whew!

714
00:30:51,153 --> 00:30:53,120
I can't friggin' believe it.

715
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:55,055
I did.

716
00:30:59,895 --> 00:31:02,730
She is going to be fine.

717
00:31:09,404 --> 00:31:10,403
And you should talk to her.

718
00:31:10,438 --> 00:31:13,606
I don't even know if I can
look her in the eye now,

719
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:15,909
let alone talk to her.

720
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,916
30 years ago, I had an affair.

721
00:31:24,318 --> 00:31:26,285
I cheated on Adele.

722
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,820
And I had a daughter.

723
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:29,755
I have a daughter.

724
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,292
Adele never told Lois or
anyone about the affair.

725
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:37,429
She never bashed me to her family.

726
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:40,632
She lived with that pain and
embarrassment for years...

727
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:42,734
alone.

728
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:46,671
She protected me, and I'm ashamed of that.

729
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,072
It was a mess.

730
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,441
I made a mess.

731
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:54,512
And for as much pain as I caused and felt,

732
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:56,347
I would have never believed

733
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,950
that anything good would have come of it.

734
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,184
But it did.

735
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:02,619
She did.

736
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:08,057
And I am very proud to know her.

737
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:24,807
You were right. She doesn't belong here.

738
00:32:24,841 --> 00:32:26,008
She almost killed a patient.

739
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:28,711
She can't be trusted... not in
the O.R., not with patients.

740
00:32:28,745 --> 00:32:30,779
She's just dangerous.

741
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:35,850
Say it again.

742
00:32:35,885 --> 00:32:36,985
What?

743
00:32:38,554 --> 00:32:39,988
I was right.

744
00:32:40,022 --> 00:32:41,623
I tried to rise above

745
00:32:41,657 --> 00:32:44,091
because it's the right thing to do.

746
00:32:45,427 --> 00:32:48,563
But she has made mistake after mistake,

747
00:32:48,597 --> 00:32:51,532
and she just is impossible.

748
00:32:59,507 --> 00:33:02,543
I'm sorry. It's the truth.

749
00:33:02,577 --> 00:33:05,846
She is working at a hospital
that is above her skill level.

750
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,915
I have tried to teach her... all day.

751
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:09,214
I have tried.

752
00:33:09,249 --> 00:33:11,551
Oh, please. You're being a bully.

753
00:33:11,585 --> 00:33:12,718
And you've gone out of
your way to make her...

754
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:15,354
you don't teach by shoving
someone else's face in the dirt.

755
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:16,255
That's not teaching.

756
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:19,559
That's just being mean and... and small.

757
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:44,114
Leave me alone.

758
00:33:45,784 --> 00:33:47,517
Since when do you pray?

759
00:33:47,552 --> 00:33:49,186
I'm not.

760
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,689
Or talk to god or whatever.

761
00:33:51,723 --> 00:33:53,523
I'm not talking to god.

762
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:55,593
Well, you talk to Tequila.

763
00:33:55,627 --> 00:33:57,728
I'm talking to Derek.

764
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:59,696
Oh.

765
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,931
Okay, I'll go.

766
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:03,466
I'm trying.

767
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,969
I tried to rise, I've tried to teach her,

768
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:08,905
but I just...

769
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:10,673
Don't think I can.

770
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,745
I thought he might know

771
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:18,379
what I'm supposed to do with her,

772
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:20,649
why she's here.

773
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,585
I thought maybe he could tell me.

774
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:28,123
So, I'm just gonna sit here and...

775
00:34:28,157 --> 00:34:31,660
Wait for some divine
intervention or whatever.

776
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,972
They look like hands.

777
00:35:05,006 --> 00:35:06,240
They are.

778
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:09,343
They're your hands, bud.

779
00:35:11,912 --> 00:35:13,646
They're real hands!

780
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,187
I can hold a ball.

781
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:21,110
Yeah.

782
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:24,434
Take a little bit of time, a
few more surgeries, but yes.

783
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:27,470
What did we tell you? He's the guy.

784
00:35:30,017 --> 00:35:31,884
You are the guy.

785
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:33,519
Oh.

786
00:35:33,553 --> 00:35:34,653
Aww.

787
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,001
He never did tell me why
they call you "Bumpy."

788
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:55,040
There was a dance called the bump...

789
00:35:55,074 --> 00:35:57,342
before your time...

790
00:35:57,376 --> 00:35:59,055
and I excelled at it.

791
00:36:03,554 --> 00:36:05,622
You didn't tell him it was me.

792
00:36:06,684 --> 00:36:08,652
Well, I feel, if you want to tell people,

793
00:36:08,686 --> 00:36:10,354
that's your decision, not mine.

794
00:36:10,388 --> 00:36:13,724
I'm sorry. I'm still
trying to figure this out.

795
00:36:13,758 --> 00:36:14,925
Okay.

796
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,894
But for the record...

797
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,929
I'd be fine with it if you did.

798
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:21,931
Very fine.

799
00:36:24,008 --> 00:36:25,329
Noted.

800
00:36:40,316 --> 00:36:41,850
Yeah.

801
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,286
April.

802
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,423
I, uh...

803
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:51,126
I never said thanks for bringing Kamal.

804
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,561
I'm so sorry for lying, but...

805
00:36:53,596 --> 00:36:56,463
God, you have no idea what
you did for that little boy.

806
00:36:56,498 --> 00:36:58,132
No, no, no. You did it.

807
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,034
I mean, you brought him.

808
00:37:01,103 --> 00:37:03,271
'Cause I knew you could do it.

809
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:06,007
Okay.

810
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,975
We did it.

811
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,944
Just... Thank you.

812
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:41,040
Do you want to go...

813
00:37:41,074 --> 00:37:42,041
Hey.

814
00:37:42,075 --> 00:37:44,243
You ready?

815
00:37:46,678 --> 00:37:48,179
Um, Nathan's leaving tomorrow,

816
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:50,014
so Bailey was gonna take us out for drinks.

817
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:51,149
She wanted to hear war stories.

818
00:37:51,183 --> 00:37:52,317
Yeah.

819
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:55,019
Um, but I could just tell them
that I-I don't have to go.

820
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:57,322
Oh, no, no. Come on. You guys...
you guys go celebrate.

821
00:37:57,356 --> 00:37:58,957
Well, come with us. Yeah, come on.

822
00:37:58,991 --> 00:38:00,291
I owe you a drink.

823
00:38:01,393 --> 00:38:03,226
Another time.

824
00:38:03,261 --> 00:38:05,128
Really, you guys have fun.

825
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:21,210
I didn't want Blake here. I fought it.

826
00:38:21,244 --> 00:38:22,544
Then why did you hire her?

827
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:24,347
Because I've been accused of coddling you,

828
00:38:24,381 --> 00:38:26,248
and I didn't want to do that.

829
00:38:26,283 --> 00:38:28,351
I didn't think you'd want me to.

830
00:38:28,385 --> 00:38:29,618
That was one reason.

831
00:38:32,122 --> 00:38:33,856
I didn't want you here, either.

832
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:36,257
When you were accepted to this program,

833
00:38:36,292 --> 00:38:39,160
I didn't know how I was gonna
look at you every day...

834
00:38:39,195 --> 00:38:43,498
And be reminded of the best
and worst times of my life.

835
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:44,832
And you walked in,

836
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:46,868
the spitting image of your mother.

837
00:38:46,902 --> 00:38:49,371
Talented, smart...

838
00:38:49,405 --> 00:38:53,107
Here... every day.

839
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:56,443
And I decided that wasn't fair to you.

840
00:38:56,478 --> 00:38:59,213
I decided to put aside my
personal feelings to...

841
00:38:59,247 --> 00:39:00,847
rise above.

842
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:04,351
And I'm glad I did that.

843
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:06,053
Every day.

844
00:39:08,123 --> 00:39:09,723
He would have said the same thing.

845
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:13,626
Derek... he probably would
have even liked her.

846
00:39:18,765 --> 00:39:20,933
Excuse me. I'm looking for a patient.

847
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:22,402
Robert Matthews?

848
00:39:22,436 --> 00:39:23,702
Are you his family?

849
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,105
No, I'm hi... uh, we work together.

850
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,305
Or worked together.

851
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,474
I'm the choir director at our church.

852
00:39:29,509 --> 00:39:31,609
Oh. You're the...

853
00:39:31,644 --> 00:39:34,279
Oh. God. You saw it.

854
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:37,215
Well, I mean, of course you saw it.

855
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,783
All of America saw it.

856
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:40,218
Okay, he doesn't deserve this.

857
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,654
It's not fair that he's all
of these amazing things,

858
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:44,155
and... and this one mistake

859
00:39:44,189 --> 00:39:45,989
is all anybody's even
gonna think about him.

860
00:39:46,024 --> 00:39:49,226
Look, can I see him, please?

861
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,995
I want him to know that...

862
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,065
You know, he's got me, at least.

863
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:04,674
They say shame controls every
aspect of human behavior.

864
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,747
it's about who we believe we are.

865
00:40:16,987 --> 00:40:18,153
This was a mistake.

866
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:21,022
I don't think I can do this.

867
00:40:21,057 --> 00:40:23,192
I don't think that I want to do this.

868
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:26,828
I kind of went off on Grey about you.

869
00:40:26,862 --> 00:40:29,498
Callie... Why?

870
00:40:29,532 --> 00:40:32,000
Why are you making this harder?

871
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:34,203
I did what I should've done at the party.

872
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,041
Callie, I get it.

873
00:40:41,076 --> 00:40:43,211
They're your friends.

874
00:40:43,245 --> 00:40:44,645
He was...

875
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,114
You're a surgeon.

876
00:40:46,148 --> 00:40:48,082
We make mistakes.

877
00:40:50,185 --> 00:40:51,652
We need to be forgiven.

878
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:55,722
I will if you will.

879
00:40:58,025 --> 00:40:59,559
And...

880
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:04,331
I'm here.

881
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:05,198
If...

882
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:08,635
if you are.

883
00:41:11,004 --> 00:41:12,070
I'm here, too.

884
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:16,708
But in the end, you can't hide,

885
00:41:16,743 --> 00:41:18,877
and the body doesn't lie.

886
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:25,251
The truth is right there
for the world to see.

887
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:36,661
It's Grey.

888
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:38,429
She wants me all week.

889
00:41:38,464 --> 00:41:40,365
Hmm.

890
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:42,200
She still wants to work with me?

891
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,269
Or she still wants to ruin you.

892
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,405
Yeah.

893
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,474
Yeah, it's definitely one of those.

894
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,277
Come on.

895
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:58,282
Our shame can choke us, kill us.

896
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:04,554
It can rot us from the inside...

897
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,722
if we decide to let it.

898
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,360
Don't let that happen to you.

899
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:20,407

1
00:00:00,953 --> 00:00:04,136
The longest surgery on
record lasted for four day straight.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,793
A team of surgeons rotated in and out,

3
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:09,829
holding scalpels for sometimes
18 hours at a stretch.

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,546
Try holding anything
in your hand for 18 hours...

5
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:36,456
Now imagine you're also holding
a human life.

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,792
Okay, if my LVAD
batteries cost $500 apiece

7
00:00:39,816 --> 00:00:42,595
and I need 25 of them, how much is that?

8
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:44,297
12,500.

9
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:45,331
Very good.

10
00:00:45,355 --> 00:00:47,700
- Do you think that will be enough?
- Definitely.

11
00:00:47,724 --> 00:00:49,535
Are you sure? Because if the te...

12
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:50,970
I need an adult now.

13
00:00:50,994 --> 00:00:52,939
I'm trying to figure out
how much money to allocate

14
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:54,807
toward my test materials.

15
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:55,942
It's very stressful.

16
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:57,977
Please. You have $100,000.

17
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:00,480
I have a 90-year-old Spanish
doctor I have to convince

18
00:01:00,504 --> 00:01:02,381
to give me his patent
on his cross-polymer

19
00:01:02,405 --> 00:01:04,083
so April Kepner doesn't
find out that I'm a fraud

20
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:06,559
and a disgrace to medicine.
You're not a disgrace.

21
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:07,876
A fraud, yes.

22
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:10,688
Try having zero dollars and
a 12-year-old with a brain tumor

23
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:12,156
you promised to get rid of.

24
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,624
Sorry.

25
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:15,126
We'll stop now.

26
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,196
Auntie Amelia is so grumpy
when she loses.

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,112
Limited test subject availability.

28
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,031
Kepner didn't believe
we'd get the kids' parents

29
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,448
to let us try this on them.

30
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,707
Who's Kepner to judge?

31
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:42,854
Besides, you know, being the judge.

32
00:01:42,878 --> 00:01:44,655
You're not giving up
on Kimmie though, right?

33
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:46,775
Hell no. I'm not giving up.

34
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:49,450
But she kinda looks like she might be.

35
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:59,704
Hey, ladybug!

36
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:01,839
Come here. Hello.

37
00:02:01,863 --> 00:02:03,908
Hey, I just wanted to say "hi"
before I had to go to work.

38
00:02:03,932 --> 00:02:06,711
Come here, ladybug. Oh!

39
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:08,246
- What is, uh, all this?
- Hello.

40
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,147
Are you sick?

41
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,249
Oh, I'm just a little ung-hay over-ay.

42
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:13,251
Partied a bit too hard last night, so...

43
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:15,653
I'm rehydrating.

44
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,255
Banana bag works like magic.

45
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:19,424
- Partied?
- Yes, yes, yes.

46
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:21,592
All right. How are you, my ladybug?

47
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:22,860
You're so squishy.

48
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:24,362
You smell like soap.

49
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:25,363
Yum.

50
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:26,597
Okay, sweetheart.

51
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:27,932
Bye, Daddy.

52
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:28,933
I'll see you later.

53
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:31,102
Say "bye-bye."

54
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:32,370
Hi, booboo.

55
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:34,739
Hi. Hi.

56
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:36,874
But my device will enable

57
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:39,110
a smoother entry for colonoscopies,

58
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:41,279
and then you won't have to
back it out and back it in

59
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:42,880
to get around the corners.

60
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:44,015
That is very cool.

61
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,350
Oh, uh, good morning, Chief.

62
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,286
Uh, I-I didn't see your car in the lot.

63
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,854
Oh, I'm taking the train now.

64
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,522
Well, it's your first day back on the job

65
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,790
and you're already pushing yourself?

66
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:54,926
No, I'm...

67
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,762
finding a way to fit exercise
into my day.

68
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:01,065
It is 2,004 steps to the train.

69
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:02,900
If I'd done this a year ago,

70
00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:04,969
maybe I'd have never had a heart attack.

71
00:03:04,993 --> 00:03:06,904
But you're gonna take it easy today?

72
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:09,707
Not at all. I've been trapped in my bed.

73
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,419
I've binged every reality show ever made,

74
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,278
and I can physically feel my IQ lowering.

75
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:16,581
I'm getting back in the OR.

76
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:18,082
Pierce cleared me.

77
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:19,383
I did.

78
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,075
She's cleared. I cleared her.

79
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:25,323
She's cleared, and I'm not taking it back

80
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:26,891
no matter how sternly you stare at me.

81
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,945
I had things to do today.

82
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:29,627
Now I've got to spend my day
following her.

83
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:31,752
Or you could just trust
my professional assessment.

84
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:35,089
No?

85
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:38,135
Okay.

86
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,004
Repeat it back to me
so I know you both know.

87
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:42,240
Okay. Dr. Cerone will be
calling from Madrid

88
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,323
at some point this morning

89
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:45,576
to discuss the patent
on his cross-polymer.

90
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,245
They're calling on my phone,
which is fully charged

91
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,646
and on the loudest ring possible.

92
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,281
And no matter where you are
or what you're doing

93
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:52,316
when the call comes in, we find you.

94
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,318
And what are you not going to do?

95
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:55,987
Not find you.

96
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:57,021
Or?

97
00:03:57,045 --> 00:03:58,422
- Mention this to Kepner.
- Mention this to Kepner.

98
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,490
Correct.

99
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:00,858
Secret club!

100
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:02,460
Oh, my God.

101
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,366
What do you got, Warren?

102
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,501
14-year-old male, blunt abdominal trauma

103
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:12,203
and a penetrating injury
in his upper thigh.

104
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:13,271
Bleeding from a scalp lac.

105
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,373
I pulled him and his brother
out of a house fire...

106
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:16,607
chemistry experiment gone wrong.

107
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,875
Did I kill my little brother?

108
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,311
Please. He's gonna be okay, right?

109
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:21,145
Mom's gonna be so mad.

110
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:22,880
Lungs are clear, vitals are stable,

111
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:23,915
saturating 95 in the mask.

112
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:25,716
He's been coming in and out
of consciousness.

113
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,618
I was just trying to teach him chemistry.

114
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,819
Can you tell my mom?

115
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:29,854
That I wasn't doing anything wrong?

116
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:31,656
- Okay, I got him.
- Trauma one?

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,224
Yeah. No, Kepner, you and Grey,

118
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:34,659
you need to meet the other rig.

119
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:36,327
His younger brother
got thrown by the blast.

120
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:37,395
He was bleeding out from the abdomen,

121
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:38,529
and, well, one of our team,

122
00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:39,820
she just shoved her hand in there.

123
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,139
Uh, 10-year-old male
with a penetrating...

124
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,206
Why is your hand inside him?

125
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,242
- Because he was bleeding a lot.
- Take it out of him!

126
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:53,544
You look 12. Can you find
a grown-up to tell me that?

127
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:54,879
- Do not move your hand!
- Don't let go!

128
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:56,314
See that? Grown-ups.

129
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,249
Nobody move.

130
00:04:58,273 --> 00:05:00,351
Can you feel a pulse?

131
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,852
Yeah.

132
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:02,987
What do you think she's
got in her hand, Schmitt?

133
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,689
His abdominal aorta?

134
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:05,990
Yep.

135
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,158
Don't take your hand out!

136
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,359
What's your name?

137
00:05:08,383 --> 00:05:10,194
Herrera. Andy Herrera.

138
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:12,096
Okay, Herrera, we got to
get him up to the OR.

139
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,764
And I'm sure you're
very clear about this,

140
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:16,067
but you cannot move your hand.

141
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:18,235
Can you hold pressure while
we bring the gurney down?

142
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:20,671
My hand, arm, and shoulder
are already numb,

143
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,007
but... I'm going with yes.

144
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:33,260

00:05:37,078 --> 00:05:39,290
- Tell me you have good news.
- I have good news.

146
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:40,891
The models are holding up
to the ultrasound?

147
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:42,226
Nope. I just melted three more.

148
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,795
What? You found a way
to dissipate the heat?

149
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,563
Not yet, which explains the melting.

150
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:47,264
Okay, you found the right
resonant frequency?

151
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:48,766
That's the hardest part, so no.

152
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,101
So what's the good news?

153
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,203
I called in reinforcements.

154
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,605
Shepherd. How's it going, bae?

155
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:55,773
This is the good news?

156
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:57,074
Tom, thanks for coming.

157
00:05:57,098 --> 00:05:58,309
How's the head? May I?

158
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,645
Oh. Seamless.

159
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:01,779
Literally. I'm so good.

160
00:06:01,803 --> 00:06:04,315
Tom, this is Alex Karev,
my partner on this project.

161
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:05,983
- Yeah, we've met before.
- Did we?

162
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:06,851
H-How do you fit into this?

163
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,986
Neuro? Uh, interventional radiology?

164
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,854
No, peds surgery.

165
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:12,089
My patient, uh, inspired this study.

166
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:13,891
Oh. When Shepherd said, "on the team,"

167
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,159
I figured that meant you were a player.

168
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:16,727
But, hey, mascots are important.

169
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,229
Those T-shirt guns don't fire themselves.

170
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,997
Tom has done incredible work,

171
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:22,066
uh, in developing navigation
systems for brain surgeries.

172
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,434
Blah, blah, I'm amazing.

173
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,436
We should, uh, get a bite or something.

174
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,004
- Y-You and me.
- No, we should get back to work, maybe.

175
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:28,639
We could, uh, catch up.
You can bring me up to speed.

176
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:30,141
Uh, the data's already here.

177
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:31,842
I just wanted you
to hit the ground running.

178
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:34,802
Oh, noses to the grindstone.
Such a tease, Shepherd.

179
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:37,754
Okay, careful, everybody.

180
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:39,083
If she moves her hand
even just a little bit,

181
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,085
- he's dead in seconds.
- Got it.

182
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:41,886
Keep a healthy distance.

183
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,235
Bump into her, and I'll kill you.

184
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:44,488
Also got it.

185
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,763
- Slow and steady.
- Careful. Careful.

186
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:56,100
Uh, that's my phone.

187
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,334
I figured.

188
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:59,136
Really, Helm? Ever heard of vibrate?

189
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,337
It's for you, Dr. Grey.

190
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:01,605
Yeah, I can't take it right now.

191
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,307
- But you said...
- I know what I said.

192
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:05,099
Just deal with it.

193
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:09,280
Hello? Uh, Dr. Grey
is unavailable, can...

194
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,215
Halfway there.

195
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:12,383
They do not sound happy.

196
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:15,386
I mean, it's in another
language, but a very angry...

197
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,821
Deal with it, Hellmouth.

198
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:19,690
- Hellmouth?
- She's a rookie, huh?

199
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:20,848
Yeah.

200
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:27,521
We're good. I'm good.

201
00:07:29,357 --> 00:07:31,202
His pulse feels weak. Can we move faster?

202
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:32,503
I'm not killing a kid today.

203
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:33,738
Hey, I'm gonna run ahead
and clear a path.

204
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:35,406
Come on, come on!

205
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,141
If you could just jump up there.

206
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:47,678
Is Zach okay?

207
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:49,513
We were watching this YouTube video.

208
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:51,315
He added the peroxide
just like they said.

209
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,516
Ow.

210
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,884
We'll check on your brother, Tyler,

211
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,252
a-and Dr. Hunt will give you
some more medicine

212
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:56,720
for your pain, okay?

213
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,589
And, uh... You were gonna do that, right?

214
00:07:58,613 --> 00:07:59,857
Yeah, I was.

215
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:01,192
Warren, don't you have fires to put out?

216
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:02,860
Like, literal fires?

217
00:08:02,884 --> 00:08:04,995
The whole thing exploded
and he wasn't saying anything.

218
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,665
He just laid there. I didn't mean to...

219
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,033
I was just trying to teach him science.

220
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:10,901
Listen. It's okay. Okay, just relax.

221
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:12,870
We're gonna take care of you both, okay?

222
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:14,872
- Should I dress these burns?
- That can wait.

223
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:16,540
Just cover the burns
with a saline-soaked gauze.

224
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:17,741
He needs a head CT, stat.

225
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:19,543
And we need to find out how deep
that metal is penetrating...

226
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:20,833
- Okay.
- ...before we remove it.

227
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:22,046
Yeah, I know that, and you know that.

228
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,550
It's Dr. Qadri's job to learn that.

229
00:08:24,574 --> 00:08:27,051
Warren, I'm gonna need you
to leave so I can teach her.

230
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:29,086
Uh... right.

231
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,454
Right. Um...

232
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,291
I'll check on your brother, Tyler.

233
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:49,106
Careful around this corner.

234
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,776
So, w-what was that phone call about?

235
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,945
I could use a distraction.

236
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:57,281
Take my mind off the fact that
I can't feel my arm anymore

237
00:08:57,305 --> 00:08:59,883
and I'm one fingertip away
from this kid dying.

238
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:02,419
Oh, there's this medical
innovation contest,

239
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:05,089
and, uh, my project is...

240
00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:07,157
Picture you have a fire hose
that isn't working, right?

241
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:08,459
Okay.

242
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:11,409
Except my fire hose is a liver.

243
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:14,832
- Okay.
- So, my idea is I want to replace it

244
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:16,767
with a sprinkler system,

245
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,456
except my sprinkler system is many livers

246
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,870
all throughout the body.

247
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,107
Sounds like science fiction.

248
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:25,242
'Cause it kind of is.

249
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:27,011
So I need a polymer,

250
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:30,347
and there's this old guy
in Madrid who has the patent.

251
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:32,316
All right, we're turning him around.

252
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,119
Uh, okay, so why didn't
you take his phone call?

253
00:09:35,143 --> 00:09:37,321
Because Kepner is heading up the contest,

254
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:39,990
and I don't want her to know
that I don't have the patent.

255
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:42,259
So you're kinda screwed.

256
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:44,028
Yep, kinda.

257
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,498
Ease him on in.

258
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:48,955
Slow.

259
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,592
Uh, a little bumpy here.

260
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:56,006
Here you go. Easy.

261
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,998
Easy.

262
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:02,646
What are you doing here?

263
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,214
The kid's brother's freaking out,

264
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:05,716
and I-I just wanted to see
if you needed my help.

265
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,018
- Okay, sure. I need your help.
- Great. What can I do?

266
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,220
Get your ass back to the station
where it belongs.

267
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:12,122
I just want to make sure these
kids get through this okay.

268
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:14,158
Except your job is to get to the station

269
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:16,293
so you can answer other calls
for other people

270
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:18,962
who need you to make sure
that they're okay.

271
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,005
Okay. Easy.

272
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:29,139
Rookies, huh?

273
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:30,708
Oh, yeah.

274
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:39,149
All set?

275
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:40,517
What?

276
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:43,987
Did you calculate
the expected heat energy, Bello?

277
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,256
Yes. Wait. Uh...

278
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,858
15 centimeters. Yes, Dr. Shepherd.

279
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:48,826
Love a good laser show.

280
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,594
Should we dim the lights?
Put on some Floyd?

281
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:52,563
Technically this laser
is just for aiming.

282
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:55,099
And you knew that. So that was a joke.

283
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:59,203
Pity laughter. My favorite.

284
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:02,172
So, turning our attention back
to the model here,

285
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:05,075
uh, when I used 400 kilohertz frequency,

286
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,010
the heat produced shattered the glass.

287
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,580
Which doesn't bode well
for the human skull.

288
00:11:09,604 --> 00:11:12,883
Your hair has grown back
very nicely, by the way.

289
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:14,718
I meant to say that earlier.

290
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:16,086
Can you flirt after
we've figured this out?

291
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,921
You're a terrible wingman, Alvin.

292
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,790
Let's, uh... Let's try focusing the beam

293
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:20,924
from a greater distance.

294
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:21,859
Got it.

295
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,632
He said greater distance.

296
00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:29,800
As in, move the beam away. Yeah.

297
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:31,201
No, of course. Sorry.

298
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:33,370
She's nervous. You're one of her idols.

299
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:34,905
- Why would you say that?
- It's true.

300
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,907
Aw, no, I'm flattered.

301
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:38,331
And you're smoking.

302
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,544
- Oh! Aah!
- Oh!

303
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:42,169
Oh, God! Aah!

304
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,783
All right.

305
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:48,118
I can't believe this project
hasn't been funded.

306
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,056
Pop quiz, Qadri.

307
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,058
What are the most important CT findings

308
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,126
in the trauma setting?

309
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,495
Uh, rule out intracranial bleeding

310
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,764
and active thoracoabdominal injury

311
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:03,567
that would require immediate
operative intervention.

312
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:06,637
Great. Page me when the images are up.

313
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:09,440
Oh, uh, h-hi.

314
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:11,408
Hi. I'm taking you to CT now.

315
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:13,343
What about my brother?

316
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:16,013
Uh, we don't have an update on him yet.

317
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:17,981
My leg hurts. What's this?

318
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,083
No! No! Dr. Hunt!

319
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,165
- Whoa, that's a lot of...
- Dr. Hunt!

320
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,308
Uh, I need a tourniquet.

321
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,291
Dr. Hunt!

322
00:12:27,315 --> 00:12:29,259
Dr. Hunt!

323
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:31,195
- What happened?
- Uh, he pulled the metal out, and...

324
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:33,030
and he's bleeding out of what
I think is his femoral...

325
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:33,997
and I-I didn't want to leave him

326
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,166
and I didn't know what else
to do, s-so I...

327
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,201
You did good, Qadri.

328
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:38,802
Let's get him straight up
to the OR right now.

329
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:39,970
Let's go.

330
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:50,647
- Hey.
- Hey.

331
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:53,951
What is the deal with April?

332
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:55,152
Uh, what do you mean?

333
00:12:55,176 --> 00:12:56,386
She's super hungover.

334
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,355
She's using the word "party" as a verb.

335
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:00,991
She's just having fun.
You know she had a rough time.

336
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:03,694
And I think she's just...
She's coming out of it.

337
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:04,628
I mean, should I be worried?

338
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:06,330
She's walking the halls
with a banana bag.

339
00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:09,122
I mean, that's not... that's not April.

340
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,294
It's not who April was with you.

341
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:17,674
I mean, she may be...

342
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:19,843
she may be someone else without you.

343
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,012
I mean, I know that I had...

344
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:23,702
I had no fun at all watching
Callie fall in love

345
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:24,882
after we broke up.

346
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:26,350
Hold on, what? Falling in love?

347
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:27,351
Who's... April's falling in love?

348
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,243
No, no, no. No, me.

349
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:29,486
- You...
- No, I, me.

350
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,454
Oh, yeah. Totally. It was no fun for me

351
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:32,389
watching Callie fall in love
after we broke up,

352
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:35,893
but she... she was happy.

353
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:38,428
April, I think is...
I think she's having fun.

354
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:41,398
I think she's trying to find
her happy without you,

355
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:45,191
so maybe you just...
you try and be happy for her.

356
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:48,194
Look...

357
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:52,242
He's not speeding us up.
He's slowing us down.

358
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,244
He just got here.

359
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:55,546
What are we whispering so loudly about?

360
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,847
She brought in Koracick.

361
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:59,249
- Oh, God. The worst.
- Total ass.

362
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,682
And he's only here to have sex with her.

363
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:01,718
He is not.

364
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:03,259
- It's a booty call.
- Is it a booty call?

365
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:05,289
You did have sex with him
the last time he was here.

366
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:06,557
I never should have told you guys that.

367
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:08,091
It was a shame-based confession.

368
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,593
Okay, and you don't get
to talk about booty calls.

369
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:10,939
You are bringing booty into our home.

370
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:13,096
Clive is not just booty.
I genuinely like Clive.

371
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,032
Yes, we've all heard
how much you like him.

372
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:16,533
All night long we hear it.

373
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:19,359
I'm gonna walk away now. Unashamed.

374
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:23,540
- Send him home.
- No.

375
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:25,409
We didn't make it into the contest.

376
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:26,276
We have no funding.

377
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,110
As much as you want to help Kimmie,

378
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,645
you can't help me with the physics

379
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:29,980
of high-energy ultrasound.

380
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:31,081
Koracick may be a tool,

381
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:33,606
but he is the kind of tool
that we need right now.

382
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:36,420
See how I did that? Tool/tool?

383
00:14:36,444 --> 00:14:37,821
He doesn't go anywhere near Kimmie.

384
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:38,755
He doesn't even get to meet her.

385
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,014
Oh, God, no.
Kimmie's got enough problems.

386
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,664
That was fast thinking back there.

387
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:48,799
Thank you, Dr. Hunt.

388
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:51,501
I'm surprised you just
took your hijab off like that.

389
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:54,237
Well, I mean, it's a symbol of my faith,

390
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,406
but my faith is about
service and compassion,

391
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,177
and he was bleeding really fast.

392
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,745
I'll help drape.

393
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:03,747
I got your page. What do we got?

394
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:05,048
Uh, kid from the fire,

395
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,651
needs an ex lap to take care of
some intra-abdominal bleeding

396
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:09,442
and a femoral artery repair.

397
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,623
And what do we got, Dr. Hunt?

398
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:14,825
Did you page Dr. Webber as well?

399
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:15,759
I did not.

400
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:18,128
A little extra help never killed anyone.

401
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:20,864
Dr. Hunt, he's crashing!

402
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:22,599
Gown and glove me, quick.

403
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,391
- I am fine.
- I'm just helping!

404
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,810
Never seen this part before.

405
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,979
Your gear is so light.

406
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:36,780
How heavy is your gear?

407
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:38,715
It depends. Am I carrying my axe?

408
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:40,283
So hard-core.

409
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,052
Okay, let's fly in that FFP

410
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:43,787
and hang it from the rapid infuser.

411
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:45,789
I need to just get in here
and clamp the aorta,

412
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:47,357
and then I'll get you out of here, okay?

413
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,493
Pressure's getting soft.

414
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:51,395
All right, we gotta move fast.

415
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:52,996
Scalpel, Bohkee.

416
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:58,902
Blue towel and retractor, please.

417
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:00,628
A Satinsky.

418
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:06,476
I can't access this aorta.

419
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,101
Oh, we got to hurry.

420
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:10,580
Herrera, take this clamp.

421
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:13,250
Huh? Me?

422
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:14,051
No, no, no.

423
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:15,719
This isn't even my dominant hand.

424
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:17,421
You run into fires. You can do this.

425
00:16:17,445 --> 00:16:18,622
Well, because my dad's a fire chief.

426
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:21,224
I mean, he taught me how to run
a hose when I was seven.

427
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:23,326
I spent my 7th birthday
up in that gallery

428
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,528
watching my mother do this.

429
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:26,163
I will walk you through this.

430
00:16:26,187 --> 00:16:27,431
Take the clamp.

431
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:30,824
Okay, open and close it for me?

432
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,370
Okay, good.

433
00:16:33,394 --> 00:16:35,338
I'm gonna support your free hand.

434
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:38,575
Now you're gonna slide it in and
clamp just above your fingers.

435
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,699
- You got it?
- Mm-hmm.

436
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:43,046
What if I miss?

437
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,748
I would prefer it if you didn't.

438
00:16:50,527 --> 00:16:52,140
Okay, is it above your fingers?

439
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:54,068
I th... I think so, yes.

440
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:55,804
Okay.

441
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:58,030
So now... can you feel it pulsating?

442
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:03,012
There! I feel it.
I-I clamped it, I think.

443
00:17:03,036 --> 00:17:04,903
- Okay.
- You can take your hand out.

444
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:08,183
Herrera, take your hand out.

445
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:09,818
You told me that if I took my hand away,

446
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:10,686
he'd bleed out in seconds.

447
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,187
Yeah, that was before you clamped him.

448
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:13,455
Yeah, I don't know if I clamped it.

449
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:16,592
- I'm not a doctor.
- Will you just trust me?

450
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:18,994
Let go of the clamp.

451
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:20,863
Move!

452
00:17:20,887 --> 00:17:23,198
- Clamp.
- Need some suction.

453
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:25,000
Great. Bovie.

454
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:27,793
You did it, Herrera. He's still alive.

455
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:31,674
Let's hang two more units.

456
00:17:31,698 --> 00:17:33,342
Sponge stick, Bohkee.

457
00:17:38,638 --> 00:17:40,683
Hey, there's scut that's
not gonna do itself, Bello.

458
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:42,685
And by do itself, I mean,
I'm not gonna do it for you.

459
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:44,787
Sorry, I'm... Sorry.

460
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:46,855
You can page me if you need me,
Dr. Koracick.

461
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,580
Count on it, Dr. Bello.

462
00:17:51,551 --> 00:17:54,129
Geez. She's hot.

463
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:55,964
Dancer body. Ass for days. She single?

464
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:56,965
Gross.

465
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:58,901
Um, she's a doctor,

466
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:00,402
so unless she's some kind of a savant,

467
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:01,737
she's of age, which makes her fair game.

468
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:03,238
Why so judgy, DeLukes?

469
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:05,240
Can we just focus on the project?

470
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:07,342
There is no project.
There aren't enough variables.

471
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:09,011
We're talking thermal ablation of targets

472
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:10,479
with micromillimeter precision.

473
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:12,548
She'll never get there
with just heat versus time.

474
00:18:12,572 --> 00:18:15,017
Why is Shepherd
still barking up that tree?

475
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,553
- I think it's the time frame.
- What time frame?

476
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:18,987
Rome wasn't built in a time frame.

477
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:19,988
What's the rush?

478
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:21,423
Kimmie. Kimmie is the rush.

479
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:23,158
What in God's name is a Kimmie?

480
00:18:23,182 --> 00:18:25,383
That. That's Kimmie.

481
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,907
Oh.

482
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:33,669
Hmm.

483
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:36,205
This kid won't stop bleeding.

484
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:38,340
Oh, there it is.

485
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:41,318
Hey, he transected his
superior mesenteric artery.

486
00:18:41,342 --> 00:18:44,046
- Can we fix that?
- We can fix that.

487
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,882
We will do a reverse saphenous graft.

488
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:49,418
Oh, that'll take hours.

489
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:51,587
Why don't you and I swap out, Bailey?

490
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:56,391
I'm sure the paperwork's
piled up after your vacation.

491
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:59,394
Uh, no, I managed to stay caught up.

492
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:00,929
I'm fine.

493
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:02,798
Here, why don't you harvest the graft

494
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:03,832
since you're already there?

495
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:07,970
I just thought maybe
you'd want to ease back in.

496
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:10,572
What is a vacation for,
if not to recuperate

497
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:14,933
so that one can return to work
at full strength?

498
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:19,948
Um, more suction here, Qadri.

499
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:24,052
His ischemia time's getting up there.

500
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:25,721
I'm aware.

501
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:28,257
You know, some vacations are so strenuous

502
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:30,592
that you need a vacation
from your vacation.

503
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:32,154
Ben Warren,

504
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:34,763
as handsome as you look in your uniform

505
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:37,666
and as grateful as I am that
you are still alive today,

506
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,334
you do not belong in there.

507
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,170
- Get out.
- I brought your patient in.

508
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:43,505
I just wanted to see how he was doing.

509
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:44,940
And how you're doing,

510
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:47,843
since it's your first day back
from vacation.

511
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,411
Okay, my vacation is over.

512
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:52,247
I went on it, and I am back.

513
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:55,017
It was glorious,
but like all experiences,

514
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,186
it now lives on in the cherished memories

515
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,987
that I share with no one but myself.

516
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:01,413
So stop talking about my vacation!

517
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:08,831
- Hey, where'd you go?
- None of your business!

518
00:20:08,855 --> 00:20:11,934
Warren, um, she's right.

519
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,468
You don't belong in here.

520
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:16,795
Uh, I've got my eye
on everything in here.

521
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,678
Now his bowel is getting dusky.

522
00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:24,780
This kid's gonna wind up
with a stool bag.

523
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:26,648
Oh, no, sir. Not on my watch.

524
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:28,540
Not on my first day back he's not.

525
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:37,960
Where's Koracick?

526
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:39,228
I sent him to see Kimmie.

527
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:41,063
- You did what?
- Damn it.

528
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,198
What? Why? Was that wrong?

529
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,905
Oh, God. Of course that was wrong.

530
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,373
I'm just calling it the way I see it,

531
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:53,041
and the sooner you face the truth...

532
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:54,409
You're full of crap and you know it!

533
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,144
"Hamilton" only made your top three

534
00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:57,346
because it's new and shiny.

535
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,581
And you only left it off
your list because you're bitter

536
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:01,917
that you couldn't score tickets
for the original cast.

537
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:03,552
It goes "Cabaret," "Hamilton," "Rent."

538
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:06,889
So... no Sondheim?

539
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:08,423
Stephen Sondheim.

540
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:09,524
Damn it. Sondheim.

541
00:21:09,548 --> 00:21:10,859
Yeah, can't count him out.

542
00:21:10,883 --> 00:21:13,061
Count of three. Best Sondheim.
One, two, three.

543
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:13,896
"Into The Woods."
- "Sweeney Todd."

544
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,097
- Oh.
- Gross.

545
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:16,295
No, he wielded a hell of a scalpel.

546
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:18,100
They've been at this
for 20 minutes straight.

547
00:21:18,124 --> 00:21:19,868
Happiest I've seen her in days.

548
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:21,703
"Into the Woods," a quarter
of the Broadway audience

549
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:23,071
left that show at intermission.

550
00:21:23,095 --> 00:21:24,907
'Cause they want an easy, happy ending.

551
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:27,876
But, hello, that's why it's brilliant.

552
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,901
Doctors. Second opinion. Weigh in.

553
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:32,915
Uh...

554
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:34,917
Ah, love me a good weirdo.

555
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:36,752
I can see why you're trying
to rush the process.

556
00:21:36,776 --> 00:21:38,287
Good. Now we can make some headway.

557
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:39,543
Oh, I have no doubt we're gonna make

558
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,390
this ultrasound our bitch
and save a lot of lives.

559
00:21:41,414 --> 00:21:43,458
But let's not, uh, delude
ourselves into thinking

560
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:45,627
Kimmie's will be one of them.

561
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:47,429
There is no easy, happy ending here.

562
00:21:47,453 --> 00:21:49,197
She's got a few months to live,

563
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:51,890
you know, if she's lucky.

564
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:04,990
New Guy.

565
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,912
I know. I shouldn't be here.

566
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:09,713
I just placed a clamp.

567
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:11,415
On an aorta.

568
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,750
- You did?
- Yes!

569
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:15,152
Damn. I... I gotta admit
I'm kinda jealous.

570
00:22:15,176 --> 00:22:16,820
It was amazing.

571
00:22:16,844 --> 00:22:18,155
And awful, because
as soon as I placed it,

572
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:20,391
the whole OR erupted, and then...

573
00:22:20,415 --> 00:22:22,426
It's hard having a front-row seat,

574
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,827
and then getting kicked out, ya know?

575
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:25,429
I do.

576
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:27,688
I just hope he makes it.

577
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:31,268
You... You wanna see for yourself?

578
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:33,270
Look, I-I can't get you front row,

579
00:22:33,294 --> 00:22:35,673
but I can get you pretty close.

580
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:37,241
Come on.

581
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:39,877
The patient's mother's here.

582
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,111
She's looking for an update.

583
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:43,303
Okay, the graft is ready.

584
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:46,170
Dr. Qadri, can you go out and update...

585
00:22:46,194 --> 00:22:47,885
Oh, no, Dr. Qadri cannot.

586
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:51,722
She cannot go and update this
patient's mother by herself

587
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,049
because she's an intern.

588
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:56,152
An intern who has yet to update
any patient's family

589
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:57,288
about anything.

590
00:22:57,312 --> 00:23:00,324
And she's not going to start
by facing that mom alone

591
00:23:00,348 --> 00:23:02,560
to tell her her two boys

592
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:04,184
might not make it out of this alive.

593
00:23:06,854 --> 00:23:08,165
Oh, for the love of...

594
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:12,826
Mm.

595
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:18,509
I had a heart attack!

596
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:20,111
Hmm.

597
00:23:20,135 --> 00:23:23,047
That's what Dr. Webber has gone
out of his way not to say.

598
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:24,980
He's gone out of his way all damn day

599
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:29,620
to not reveal my secret,
to not let me do my job,

600
00:23:29,644 --> 00:23:34,125
and to make sure that I'm not
putting any extra stress

601
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:36,417
and strain on my body, and it's not okay.

602
00:23:36,441 --> 00:23:38,129
I know better than to show up

603
00:23:38,153 --> 00:23:39,903
to this hospital before I'm ready,

604
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:41,687
I know better than to put a child's life

605
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,301
in my hands before I am ready,

606
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:46,033
and I am ready to do my job.

607
00:23:46,461 --> 00:23:51,165
Now, I would appreciate everyone
doing their own jobs, too.

608
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:59,250
Focusing on the field,
until the awkward goes away.

609
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:00,718
5-0 prolene, please.

610
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,153
Dr. Bailey, look, all we're...

611
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:03,621
Babysitters get paid $10 an hour.

612
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:04,956
You want to get paid $10 an hour?

613
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,470
I can arrange for that.

614
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,221
Go.

615
00:24:11,486 --> 00:24:13,020
Come on.

616
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,072
Clive's nice.

617
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:22,340
He's cute. He's funny.

618
00:24:22,364 --> 00:24:23,862
Aww. And the sex?

619
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:25,488
Wow, you're just getting
straight to it, huh?

620
00:24:25,513 --> 00:24:27,959
Well, Carina is...
is only getting better.

621
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:30,181
There's, like, no slump.

622
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:31,449
It's the opposite of a slump.

623
00:24:31,473 --> 00:24:33,184
It's a boom. It's a sex boom.

624
00:24:35,043 --> 00:24:37,121
Ladies, what are we laughing about?

625
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:38,255
- Sex.
- Nothing.

626
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,090
Sex? Really?

627
00:24:39,114 --> 00:24:41,659
I was expecting maternal mortality

628
00:24:41,683 --> 00:24:42,860
or rechargeable hearts or something.

629
00:24:42,884 --> 00:24:44,628
But, no, that's... I can talk sex.

630
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:46,464
Well, you know, the thing about
rechargeable hearts...

631
00:24:46,488 --> 00:24:49,533
Maggie's got a date with Clive.

632
00:24:49,557 --> 00:24:51,369
- Is Clive still around?
- Mm-hmm.

633
00:24:51,393 --> 00:24:52,719
- Mm-hmm.
- Look at that. That's adorable.

634
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:53,938
I got a date tonight, too.

635
00:24:53,962 --> 00:24:55,039
- Oh.
- Uh, Priya is her name.

636
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:56,140
- Oh.
- Yeah.

637
00:24:56,164 --> 00:24:57,041
- Who?
- Did you make that up?

638
00:24:57,065 --> 00:24:58,843
Priya. Very cool, brilliant, actually.

639
00:24:58,867 --> 00:24:59,777
- Oh.
- Mm.

640
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:01,345
Very attractive.
Human rights attorney, so...

641
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:02,413
Well, that's hot. That's hot.

642
00:25:02,437 --> 00:25:04,382
- Pretty impressive, yeah.
- Yeah, that is... That's hot.

643
00:25:04,406 --> 00:25:06,183
- Interesting.
- Um, you know,

644
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:08,519
I think I'm gonna... vending machine.

645
00:25:08,543 --> 00:25:09,687
- Really?
- Yeah.

646
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:10,588
- Oh.
- Huh.

647
00:25:10,612 --> 00:25:11,822
I'm gonna start double gloving.

648
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:14,492
My hands smelled like bedpan
when I was eating last night.

649
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:17,461
Oh. I scrubbed in on
a bowel resection yesterday.

650
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:18,892
Being on The Party's good side

651
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,231
has benefits.

652
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:22,800
I almost called her Dr. Party
this morning

653
00:25:22,824 --> 00:25:24,502
instead of Dr. Kepner.

654
00:25:24,526 --> 00:25:26,778
Is that a fireable offense?

655
00:25:26,802 --> 00:25:28,706
You're just gonna be
really happy for her.

656
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,509
- No, super happy, overjoyed.
- Okay. Yep.

657
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:34,311
I never would've pegged myself
as a guy who's into moms,

658
00:25:34,335 --> 00:25:36,347
but moms make you do things
till you get 'em right.

659
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:40,184
Nope.

660
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:42,420
Dr. Roy. Hey, buddy.

661
00:25:42,444 --> 00:25:45,256
Um, I've got a patient,
Mr. Wilkins, in 1413,

662
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,259
with a large, super infected
abscess in his groin

663
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:49,760
that you're gonna drain for me.

664
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:51,318
- Um...
- Now.

665
00:25:56,182 --> 00:25:58,402
- Yes, I-I tried.
- Maybe you should try harder.

666
00:25:58,426 --> 00:25:59,370
She's the mother of my kid, and this...

667
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:00,694
Harder, harder.

668
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:07,344
Kepner, Grey, I'm about
to update his mother.

669
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:08,245
What can you tell me?

670
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:10,381
He had an injury to his abdominal aorta

671
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:12,247
- that we're trying to repair.
- Ah, damn.

672
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,342
It's a mess.

673
00:26:13,366 --> 00:26:15,853
We're still trying to evaluate
the extent of the injury.

674
00:26:15,877 --> 00:26:17,311
Can I get a towel?

675
00:26:21,822 --> 00:26:23,422
All right. Okay, we're good.

676
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:27,398
So, you're a rule breaker?

677
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:28,766
Uh, n-no.

678
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,401
Only at places I no longer work.

679
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:32,025
Mm-hmm.

680
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:41,112
Both your boys sustained serious injuries

681
00:26:41,136 --> 00:26:42,980
and are in surgery.

682
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:44,415
We'll let you know more
as soon as we can.

683
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:45,796
Both of them?

684
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:48,590
Are they okay?

685
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,388
They're in surgery,
but they'll be okay, right?

686
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:53,701
We're fighting for them.
We're doing everything we can.

687
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:55,426
I have a job.

688
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,495
I have to work.

689
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,331
I need to feed them
because they are 14 and 10

690
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:02,299
and they eat everything
that isn't nailed down.

691
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:05,087
I cannot hold onto them
every minute of the day.

692
00:27:05,111 --> 00:27:07,905
I have to go to work. They're 14 and 10.

693
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:09,607
I mean, they should be able to
be home for a morning

694
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:12,099
while I go to work without...

695
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:15,006
Oh, my God.

696
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:18,249
Tyler is 14, and Zach is 10.

697
00:27:18,273 --> 00:27:19,817
They have to be okay.

698
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:21,318
They have to be okay.

699
00:27:21,342 --> 00:27:23,020
They have to be okay.

700
00:27:23,044 --> 00:27:24,588
Oh, my God.

701
00:27:24,612 --> 00:27:25,646
Oh, my God!

702
00:27:29,502 --> 00:27:32,590
- I can't believe you used to do this.
- What?

703
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,830
This. That. Y-Y-You did that.

704
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,398
And you were good at it?

705
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,266
Um, yeah.

706
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,335
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- I'm... I'm just saying.

707
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,005
Y-You did this incredibly cool thing

708
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:48,375
that probably pays a hell of
a lot more than what we do,

709
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,446
you did it well,
but you walked away from it?

710
00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:53,862
Why?

711
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:57,518
To do more.

712
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:00,554
I mean, yes,
I used to do that down there,

713
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,524
with the patients in the OR
where you're trying to fix them,

714
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,092
but I, you know...

715
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,962
I also cut open a guy with a clipboard.

716
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:08,909
I mean, y-y-you know the metal

717
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:09,964
- part of a clipboard?
- Mm-hmm.

718
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,633
Yeah, I broke it off
and used it as a scalpel.

719
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,969
Cracked his chest because
we were nowhere near an OR

720
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,938
and I... I did what I had to do.

721
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:22,726
And I saved his life,
but I... got into trouble.

722
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,579
A lot of trouble.

723
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:30,117
You know, but I-I never felt
anything but proud.

724
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:34,154
So now I'm doing a job where
I'm the first one on the scene

725
00:28:34,178 --> 00:28:38,992
and I get to do whatever
it takes to save that life.

726
00:28:39,977 --> 00:28:41,411
And that's only a good thing.

727
00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:48,002
I was just looking for a
"because fire" kind of answer,

728
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,961
but okay.

729
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,173
Can we listen to what's
going on down there?

730
00:28:53,197 --> 00:28:55,432
- Only if you don't let me talk anymore.
- Mm-hmm.

731
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,316
Hey! What's going on?

732
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,019
Amelia called Koracick, and I hate him.

733
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,954
Like, I want put him in
an old-fashioned choke hold

734
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,122
and throw him down the stairs hate him.

735
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:11,525
Okay. You hate him because...

736
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,494
What? I need a reason?
Have you met the guy?

737
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:16,497
Did something happen? With Kimmie?

738
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,990
It's just... some kids
get under your skin.

739
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:37,151
You're dropping out? Really?

740
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,185
I'm not dropping out,
but I'm not gonna rush

741
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,078
developing this thing over
an unrealistic deadline.

742
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,432
- You don't agree.
- No, I don't.

743
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:45,928
You think I don't know that

744
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:47,361
this girl is dying?

745
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,229
You should have seen her
when we first met her.

746
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:50,397
She is a fraction of who she was.

747
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,133
But she is still alive,
and she is still full of hope,

748
00:29:53,157 --> 00:29:55,202
and that means we don't
get to say, "I give up."

749
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,385
If doctors said, "I give up,"

750
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:57,871
we would all be dead
of cholera right now.

751
00:29:57,895 --> 00:29:59,673
We don't get to give up.
We don't get to write her off.

752
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,175
We don't quit.

753
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,509
Yeah, I know you think you're right,

754
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:04,244
but you're used to Brain Tumor Shepherd,

755
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:05,913
so you don't hear it when nonsense

756
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,348
comes out of your mouth.

757
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:08,816
I am not being crazy.

758
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,084
Then stop being naive.

759
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,986
Stop being a ridiculous Pollyanna

760
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,187
and please, please

761
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,089
stop diminishing this little girl's life

762
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,524
by barking things at me that
belong on a refrigerator magnet.

763
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:19,159
It's beneath you.

764
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:21,829
She is going to die,
and any effort that you spend

765
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,330
that doesn't go toward preventing that

766
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,733
is a supreme disservice to her.

767
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,534
And this... This is not gonna save her.

768
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:30,237
This is the only thing
that might save her.

769
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,005
She's not gonna have much of a life

770
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,740
with an exploded, flaming skull.

771
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:33,640
Well, then, we reduce the heat.

772
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:36,276
And you leave the tumor! You do nothing!

773
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,178
- God, you're...
- Then we attack it from another angle!

774
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:40,080
We do something else entirely!
Maybe it's not ultrasound.

775
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,415
Maybe it's some kind of radiation...

776
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,183
- Sh-Shut up.
- You shut up!

777
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:44,451
We attack it from another angle.

778
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,452
I just said that.

779
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,955
And then we reduce the heat.

780
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,090
Yeah, I said that, too. Why are you...

781
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,192
No. Mnh-mnh.

782
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:54,128
With more beams,

783
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,929
we control the amount of heat generated.

784
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:59,133
This way we have more variables.

785
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,434
So two beams?

786
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,236
Or... Or... Or seven.

787
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,139
Or 27, or a thousand

788
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,641
that we run for shorter periods of time.

789
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,276
So when they enter the skull,
they don't heat it.

790
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,811
And where the beams come together...

791
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,246
The reinforced waves are intense enough

792
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,981
that they heat and kill just the tumor!

793
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:17,217
I mean, it's... it's brilliant.

794
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:19,153
I mean... I'm brilliant.

795
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,561
Bailey, it's been five minutes
and the bowel hasn't pinked up

796
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:28,996
and I don't hear any flow.

797
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,964
We're gonna have to consider
resecting this bowel.

798
00:31:30,988 --> 00:31:34,191
Ju... Hold on.
Sometimes it takes a while.

799
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,807
Was it severe? The MI?

800
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,758
Severely scary.

801
00:31:41,783 --> 00:31:44,011
- A stent?
- CABG.

802
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:47,304
God, Bailey. I'm sorry.
I just wish that I'd...

803
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:50,484
Wait, wait. That was your vacation!

804
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,352
There you go, Dr. Sherlock.

805
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:53,954
Uh, can I get the
fluorescein dye, please?

806
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,378
Thank you.

807
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,049
All right.

808
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,554
Okay. Can I get the lights off, please?

809
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,371
Dr. Qadri, you want to run the UV?

810
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:15,709
All right.

811
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,344
It's beautiful.

812
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,849
The dye is flowing with the blood

813
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,718
and clearly perfusing the bowel.

814
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,121
This boy will not need a colostomy.

815
00:32:28,312 --> 00:32:29,823
Vacation is over.

816
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,861
What is that? W-Why is he...

817
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,496
I don't know. Hit the lights.

818
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,397
He's tachy and his pressure's dropping.

819
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:39,299
He's developing hives.

820
00:32:39,323 --> 00:32:41,235
He must be allergic to the dye.
It's anaphylaxis.

821
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,737
Epi .5 and run saline wide open.

822
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,596
Push 125 of solumedrol now.

823
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,199
Wow.

824
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,013
Yeah.

825
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,982
Hi. Sorry, uh,

826
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,351
there is a call
coming through from Madrid.

827
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,919
- Madrid?
- Yeah.

828
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:01,054
Uh, I can scrub in
so that you can step away.

829
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:02,689
I can't step away right now.

830
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,395
Uh...

831
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,888
Sorry, that's for me, actually.
Yeah, I can take that up here.

832
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,391
Now, Hellmouth.

833
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:24,178
¿Te dijo este es el proyecto
más importante, no?

834
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,546
Por favor escuchame bien.

835
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,047
No, no, no.

836
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,918
Would it kill them
to turn off the intercom? Geez.

837
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,696
Uh-oh.

838
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,264
Warren, what are you doing
in the gallery?

839
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,302
Well, H-Herrera saved that kid,

840
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,304
and she just wanted to see
how he was doing, so...

841
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:53,273
Waiting room is for
first responders to wait

842
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,809
and to make calls. I know, but...

843
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,911
You brought that kid out of the fire.

844
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,313
You brought him to us.

845
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,782
The rest isn't up to you anymore.

846
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,283
You made your choice, Warren.

847
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,385
It was a tough choice, but you made it.

848
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:06,587
So go back to work.

849
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:10,490
Or wait in the waiting room.

850
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:28,742
I'm not sure that went
as well as we had hoped.

851
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:42,193
Mrs. Richardson?

852
00:34:43,351 --> 00:34:45,496
I can't stand up.

853
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,998
I'm Dr. Grey.
I was in with your son Zach.

854
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:50,167
He made it through surgery.
He's in recovery.

855
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:52,603
And... And Tyler?

856
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:56,207
I don't know about Tyler, but
I can get an update for you.

857
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:07,518
Uh, h-he made it.

858
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:09,353
Oh. It was touch and go.

859
00:35:09,377 --> 00:35:11,322
He had an allergic reaction in surgery,

860
00:35:11,346 --> 00:35:12,656
but Tyler made it.

861
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,692
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

862
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:16,026
Thank you.

863
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,662
Thank you. Thank you.

864
00:35:18,686 --> 00:35:20,798
Thank you so much.

865
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:31,911
What's going on?

866
00:35:31,935 --> 00:35:34,378
Sh-Shh. Pipe down.
You'll scare the tumor.

867
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,751
Burn, baby, burn.

868
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:41,919
Amazing.

869
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:44,088
- I am, right?
- Yes.

870
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:46,023
Uh, y-you... y-yeah.

871
00:35:48,116 --> 00:35:49,326
Come on, come on.

872
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,228
Look at that. Look at that.

873
00:35:54,556 --> 00:35:56,367
Well, it's a... it's a start.

874
00:35:56,391 --> 00:35:58,235
That's the longest
a beaker's ever lasted.

875
00:35:58,259 --> 00:36:00,004
Glad you're on board, Adam.

876
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:02,173
- It's Alex.
- Yeah, either way.

877
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:08,345
Game Boy for you, okay?

878
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:10,514
Okay.

879
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:12,249
Herrera.

880
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:14,718
You did so great in there today.

881
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:16,287
If you ever consider a new line of work,

882
00:36:16,311 --> 00:36:17,922
we could really use you around here.

883
00:36:17,946 --> 00:36:20,124
Thought Hellmouth
might want her phone back.

884
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:22,226
- Thank you for trying.
- I didn't just try.

885
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,620
Dr. Cerone is gonna be
in the States next week

886
00:36:24,644 --> 00:36:26,490
and has agreed to come hear your pitch.

887
00:36:26,514 --> 00:36:27,957
What?! You're kidding.

888
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:29,310
Wait. What did you say?

889
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:31,202
I just said they're standing
between the hose

890
00:36:31,226 --> 00:36:33,871
and the flames right now,
by holding onto that patent.

891
00:36:34,996 --> 00:36:35,973
I mean, and I should know.

892
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:38,209
I was literally holding on
to something today

893
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:40,144
that I couldn't let go of, either, but...

894
00:36:40,168 --> 00:36:42,055
And then the time came to step away

895
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,069
and let you take over,

896
00:36:43,093 --> 00:36:45,761
and if there's anyone
he can trust to take over,

897
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,597
- it's you.
- Thank you.

898
00:36:47,621 --> 00:36:49,566
Also I tried to explain
the whole sprinkler thing,

899
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,767
but I don't think it translated.

900
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,902
Yeah, it really just sounded
like you were screaming at him.

901
00:36:52,926 --> 00:36:55,127
Ah, Romance languages are passionate.

902
00:36:57,531 --> 00:37:00,109
- We don't have to hug now, do we?
- I'm not really a hugger.

903
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:01,611
- Oh, God, no.
- Okay, good.

904
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:03,079
I had a good time today.

905
00:37:03,103 --> 00:37:04,480
It was nice to meet you, Dr. Grey.

906
00:37:04,504 --> 00:37:05,815
You too.

907
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,584
I gotta go find my rookie.

908
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:08,585
- Okay.
- All right.

909
00:37:08,609 --> 00:37:09,742
- Good night.
- See ya.

910
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:17,994
You home tonight?

911
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:20,104
Shift ends at 9:00.

912
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:31,641
W-When I started training,
you... you pushed against it.

913
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:33,843
I mean, and I get it, because, you know,

914
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:35,994
my keeping it from you
and you were thrown.

915
00:37:36,018 --> 00:37:38,337
But still, you... you pushed.

916
00:37:39,706 --> 00:37:41,617
So I pushed back.

917
00:37:42,909 --> 00:37:44,084
I was so busy pushing

918
00:37:45,747 --> 00:37:48,491
that... I never stopped
to really think about

919
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:49,292
what I'd be giving up.

920
00:37:49,316 --> 00:37:51,336
Oh, you thought about it plenty.

921
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,507
But you never stopped to feel it.

922
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:59,479
Go on, sit there. Let yourself feel it.

923
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:05,630
Then get up... do what you do.

924
00:38:08,278 --> 00:38:09,455
What are you gonna do?

925
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:12,739
I am gonna feel my day, too.

926
00:38:25,123 --> 00:38:27,840
Hey. How you doing?

927
00:38:27,864 --> 00:38:29,008
Fine. Why?

928
00:38:29,032 --> 00:38:30,610
I just noticed some of the interns

929
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:32,512
have nicknamed you "The Party," so...

930
00:38:32,536 --> 00:38:33,513
Yeah.

931
00:38:33,537 --> 00:38:35,748
I'm pretty sure they mean that
as a compliment.

932
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,350
Well, some of the things they were saying

933
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:38,685
weren't exactly complimentary.

934
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:40,587
Well, you should hear
what they say about you.

935
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:41,942
Okay.

936
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:43,420
All right, maybe you can
tell me about that

937
00:38:43,444 --> 00:38:44,421
over coffee or something.

938
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:46,490
We could actually speak
to each other, catch up.

939
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:49,326
Well, uh, you've got Harriet
tonight, and I got plans.

940
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,228
Yes, April. Look, I'm just...

941
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:55,165
I'm worried about you.

942
00:38:55,189 --> 00:38:58,502
You're Harriet's dad.
You're not mine, okay?

943
00:38:58,526 --> 00:38:59,403
Night.

944
00:39:12,506 --> 00:39:15,285
I, uh, thought you might want this.

945
00:39:18,813 --> 00:39:20,093
Thank you.

946
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:22,125
You did incredible work today.

947
00:39:23,884 --> 00:39:25,179
I don't...

948
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,850
I don't know if I could've
handled it if he didn't live.

949
00:39:30,391 --> 00:39:32,469
You could have.

950
00:39:32,493 --> 00:39:33,797
I'm glad you didn't have to.

951
00:39:59,487 --> 00:40:00,530
Ready to go?

952
00:40:02,156 --> 00:40:04,634
Yeah.

953
00:40:04,658 --> 00:40:06,803
Yeah, I'm good to go.

954
00:40:06,827 --> 00:40:08,472
So, uh, you want to call a rig?

955
00:40:08,496 --> 00:40:11,350
Mm, nah, I thought we'd hitchhike.

956
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:02,559
Oh, my God.

957
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:04,779
Cheers!

958
00:41:12,293 --> 00:41:14,371
When you hold on to
anything for too long,

959
00:41:14,395 --> 00:41:17,073
your muscles conform
to the position you're holding.

960
00:41:17,097 --> 00:41:20,644
That applies to the heart and
the mind, as well as the hand.

961
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:28,785
♪ Oh, Danny Boy, the pipes,
the pipes are calling ♪

963

Wait, let me try it again.

00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:40,297
Wait. O-Oh, wait. The rest of it goes...

966
00:41:40,321 --> 00:41:41,398
Hold on. Um...

967
00:41:41,422 --> 00:41:48,471
♪ The summer's gone,
and all the roses falling ♪

968
00:41:48,495 --> 00:41:56,613
♪ It's you, it's you must go,
and I'll abide ♪

969
00:41:56,637 --> 00:41:58,805
Huh? Not bad.

970
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,152
Good, good.

971
00:42:02,176 --> 00:42:03,594
The pain you know is coming

972
00:42:03,618 --> 00:42:07,447
is what makes it easier
to just keep holding on.

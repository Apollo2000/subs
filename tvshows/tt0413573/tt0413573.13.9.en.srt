1
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:04,893
Surgeons fight.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,421
I didn't bring it up. He did.

3
00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:07,789
Well, what? It's the truth.

4
00:00:07,823 --> 00:00:10,391
I said we're not talking about it.

5
00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:12,227
We fight against death. It's our thing.

6
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:14,929
Well, on the plus side, it's
your last day in the clinic.

7
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:16,598
Clinic wasn't so bad.

8
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:17,799
What did I just say?

9
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,134
We're drinking tonight, right?

10
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:20,135
Not about this.

11
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:21,169
Mer, the trial's tomorrow.

12
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:23,938
It could be our last chance
for like 8, 10 years.

13
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:26,875
But eventually,
if history is any indicator,

14
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:29,244
death is gonna win.

15
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:31,913
Or you could win, and we
could drink tomorrow night.

16
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:33,214
Yeah. Right.

17
00:00:33,249 --> 00:00:35,483
- There's a chance.
- Yeah. Slim to none.

18
00:00:35,518 --> 00:00:38,720
We may win the battle, but
we're never gonna win the war.

19
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:41,156
What about a plea?

20
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,258
Didn't they offer you a plea
for like two years?

21
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:45,927
I turned it down. Maybe
I shouldn't have turned it down.

22
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:48,763
Two years is still a long time.
Zero years is the goal.

23
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:52,467
So the trick is to go down fighting,

24
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:55,470
to fight for the right cause,
for the right person.

25
00:00:55,504 --> 00:00:57,305
We're drinking tonight.
It's my last day on Earth.

26
00:00:57,339 --> 00:00:59,440
Stop! Stop talking about drinking!

27
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:01,476
Stop talking about last days on Earth!

28
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,344
The world is not coming to an end.

29
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:06,748
And if you go down,
you all go down together.

30
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,359
Oh, we're drinking tonight.

We are the eye of the storm
on this, people.

33
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:31,372
Everything and everyone
is coming our way.

34
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:33,341
Code Yellow has been declared.

35
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:36,945
Disaster protocol is in effect
until you hear otherwise.

36
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:38,880
I'm recalling all surgical staff.

37
00:01:38,914 --> 00:01:41,182
Already recalled my nurses.
I've got the E.R. covered.

38
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:42,450
Klein's manning the O.R. floor.

39
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:43,885
Who do you have up there on...

40
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:46,154
Doctors Grey, Shepherd, Baker, and Lowes

41
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:50,692
are on nonstop cut-and-paste
in O.R.s 1 through 4.

42
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:52,393
Okay. I got one from the supply room.

43
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:54,295
Also, why do we keep these, anyways?

44
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,297
I mean, who needs
an instant photo anymore?

45
00:01:56,332 --> 00:01:57,866
Because an apartment building

46
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,734
collapsed in the middle of Seattle.

47
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:03,238
Look, right now we're getting
the victims, the survivors.

48
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:05,473
Then in about 20 minutes,
we're gonna start getting

49
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:07,342
the people who love the victims...

50
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:10,645
their moms and husbands and girlfriends

51
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,014
and grandmas and friends and children

52
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:14,983
and wives with babies in their arms.

53
00:02:15,017 --> 00:02:18,686
This waiting room is going to
fill up with hopeful people

54
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,588
wanting to know where
their loved ones are.

55
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:23,091
Now, some of their loved ones are here,

56
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,193
but most of their loved ones are buried

57
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:27,395
under the rubble
of that collapsed building.

58
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:29,764
And the only way to know for sure,

59
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:32,533
the only way they can identify

60
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:36,404
who made it to this hospital
and who didn't...

61
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,444
This photo is a golden ticket.

62
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:48,049
I want a photo of every single patient

63
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,251
on this board in the next hour.

64
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:51,185
- Got it?
- Got it.

65
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,588
Dr. Minnick. I have surgical privileges.

66
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:57,425
Dr. Minnick! Well, I didn't
expect you until, uh, Monday.

67
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,027
I was unpacking,
and I saw it on the news.

68
00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:00,595
They said the injured were coming here,

69
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:03,398
and I thought, "Hey.
I work here. I should help."

70
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:05,733
Yeah. Appreciate that.
I better get into some scrubs.

71
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,435
Hey, jump in, and then
when this calms down,

72
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,137
- maybe we can grab a cup of coffee.
- I'd love to.

73
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:11,139
Be a chance to get you
up to speed before I start.

74
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:12,273
I will find you.

75
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:15,743
Get me up to speed?

76
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,579
We have two incoming!
Dr. Webber, you're up!

77
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:20,715
Hey! You got to clear the driveway!

78
00:03:20,749 --> 00:03:23,484
My kid's hurt! My kid's hurt!

79
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,285
Someone help, please!

80
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,788
Someone help, please!

81
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:30,391
Sir. Sir. You need to move your car now.

82
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:31,960
My kid's hurt real bad! Please!

83
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:34,896
Please help my baby, please.

84
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,999
Okay. Don't move her. Don't move her.

85
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,734
Get me a gurney out here now!

86
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:43,604
Whose patient is this?!

87
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,239
I've got O-neg!

88
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:48,643
Another round of epi!

89
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:51,012
Ma'am, squeeze my fingers.
I'm gonna need you to squeeze my fingers.

90
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:52,947
O-neg!

91
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,148
Yeah?

92
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:56,284
- I got to go home. I-I need to go home.
- No, you need to...

93
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:57,409
- My wife. My wife.
- You need to lie down, sir.

94
00:03:57,434 --> 00:04:00,388
Lie down, sir.

95
00:04:03,726 --> 00:04:06,761
I need a priest. I'm dying.

96
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:08,012
Uh, sir, no, we...

97
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,665
A priest, a pastor, anybody.

98
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:13,568
I-I need to talk to God.

99
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,471
Andrew.

100
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:18,706
Great. I could use an extra hand.

101
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:21,542
Can you put these chart numbers
on the photos as I take them?

102
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:23,378
Did you know about this?

103
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:25,279
Know about what? The... The photos?

104
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:27,281
No. Bailey gave me this huge lecture.

105
00:04:27,316 --> 00:04:29,350
No, no. The trial.
They want me to testify.

106
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:30,990
They're calling me
to the stand tomorrow.

107
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:32,987
What? But they said you didn't have to.

108
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,822
They said you were drinking.
Y-You're not reliable.

109
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,724
Well, someone's calling me to the stand.

110
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,727
Did you... Did you tell them?
Did you tell them about...

111
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:43,197
Jo, hey, hey, I wouldn't do that, okay?

112
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:45,466
- Here.
- Well, they must know.

113
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:47,735
Somehow they... they...
they started Googling,

114
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,670
and they figured out
that I changed my name

115
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:52,206
and that there's a point where
Jo Wilson just isn't a person.

116
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:54,551
They might not know anything.

117
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:57,412
What if they ask?

118
00:04:57,446 --> 00:04:59,580
If they ask, then I have to answer.

119
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:02,050
Well, you don't have to.

120
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:05,219
It's court.

121
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:06,644
Excuse me.

122
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:10,691
If I lie under oath and
get caught, it's a felony.

123
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:12,493
I would lose my medical license.

124
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:14,328
I have to tell the truth if they ask.

125
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:16,731
If I tell them, it's public record.

126
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:17,765
My husband could find me,

127
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,003
and everything that I built
is... is gone, done.

128
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:23,571
I'm sorry, Jo.

129
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,741
One minute, you're fine,
and the next minute,

130
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:28,076
everything just collapses around you.

131
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:31,345
Jo.

132
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,914
Yeah, I've got
a depressed skull fracture.

133
00:05:32,948 --> 00:05:34,515
- Is Shepherd here yet?
- I don't know.

134
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,650
Didn't you come in together?

135
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:37,752
Kepner, your guess is as good
as mine where she is.

136
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:39,187
We... Is everything okay?

137
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:40,688
Hey. I-I got to get home.

138
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:42,596
- Uh, sir, you need to lie down.
- My wife is...

139
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:44,325
I understand that, sir. What's your name?

140
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:47,829
- Charlie.
- Okay, Charlie, what I need you to do...

141
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:49,797
Ugh!

142
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:50,898
- All right.
- Thank you, Charlie.

143
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,033
We got you. We got you.

144
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,635
Okay. I need an intubation tray
and a central line kit.

145
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,903
Draw a CBC and a cross-match.

146
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,538
You guys, open up a trauma room.

147
00:05:57,573 --> 00:06:00,575
Riggs, we're gonna need a hand here.

148
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:03,878
No. I called. The chaplain's M.I.A.

149
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:05,913
There might be a rabbi up in geriatrics.

150
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,482
- Could you do it?
- What? No.

151
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:09,317
All you have to do is listen to him,

152
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:11,552
- maybe nod your head a few times.
- N-o-o.

153
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:13,221
It's got to be i-illegal or something.

154
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:15,123
- You're not gonna go to jail.
- Go to hell.

155
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:16,424
Please. You don't believe in that.

156
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,725
No, but he does, and that's good enough.

157
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,827
- Sir.
- Wh... Ohh.

158
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:21,829
You're the priest?

159
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:23,231
I-I-I was gonna...

160
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:25,299
- Uh, no, sir.
- I was gonna fix it.

161
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:26,634
Fix it?

162
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:28,636
They said it was
the earthquake last year.

163
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,605
The foundation was crumbling.

164
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,507
Is he talking about the collapse?

165
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,342
I was getting the money.

166
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:36,144
And now...

167
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:39,780
all these people.

168
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:42,750
Please, please forgive me.

169
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:44,819
- Okay, okay, okay. Sir, sir...
- Please forgive me.

170
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:49,257
I-I killed all these people.

171
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:52,760
Sir? Sir? Sir?

172
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:55,329
- I'll get a crash cart.
- Okay. Notify C.T.

173
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:58,866
Give 5 lorazepam and start a benzo drip.

174
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,801
And somebody get a damn priest!

175
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:08,180
I'm here.

176
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:11,217
Right-sided hemothorax.

177
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:15,020
Put in a chest tube. It's
already drained 300 cc of blood.

178
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:17,189
Winnie, sweetie, we're right here.

179
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:18,357
W-We're right here.

180
00:07:18,392 --> 00:07:20,393
- How old is she?
- She's 12.

181
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:22,595
We just went to get coffee.
We were about a block away.

182
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:24,897
This is fresh blood.
She's actively bleeding.

183
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:27,266
Okay, Mr. Adkins, maybe you and
your wife should wait outside.

184
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,786
No, no, I'm not leaving my
daughter here. Please, no.

185
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:31,698
Cross her for eight
and set up a rapid infuser.

186
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:32,971
I need a central line kit.

187
00:07:33,005 --> 00:07:34,771
Get the family out of this room now.

188
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:35,705
It's gonna be... No.

189
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:37,307
Baby, we're gonna be
right outside, okay?

190
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:38,675
Please. I understand.

191
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:39,962
We'll be right out here, okay?

192
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:41,444
We have to do our job.

193
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:45,949
Dr. Carlyle...

194
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:47,951
So, where is the landlord now?

195
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:50,420
C.T. Then he's going in with Grey.

196
00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:52,580
She's holed up in the O.R. doing
back-to-back surgeries all day.

197
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:54,896
Hmm. Nice work, Father Warren.

198
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:56,117
Do you do weddings?

199
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:57,994
Okay, stop it. I-It was not cool.

200
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,329
He said, "Please forgive me."

201
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:00,864
What am I supposed to do with that?

202
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,275
Maybe don't pretend to be Jesus.

203
00:08:03,302 --> 00:08:05,537
I think we got pictures
of all the patients in the back hallway.

204
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:06,938
He confessed to me. W-What do I do?

205
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:08,206
Do I go to the cops?

206
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:10,842
I think there's some sort of
confidence with priests, right?

207
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:13,511
He told you in confidence
as a man of God.

208
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:15,513
- I am not a priest.
- Amen.

209
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:17,682
Okay, what about
doctor/patient confidentiality?

210
00:08:17,717 --> 00:08:18,884
That doesn't apply.

211
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:20,719
Fine. I'm out.

212
00:08:20,753 --> 00:08:23,288
Does that apply? H-How does that apply?

213
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:24,689
I'll tell you what applies.

214
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:26,892
Maybe you don't let somebody
confess to you

215
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:30,695
in the first place because once
you know, you can't un-know.

216
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,631
The landlord knew that there
was earthquake damage,

217
00:08:32,665 --> 00:08:34,733
and he didn't do anything to fix it.

218
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:35,934
Shady as hell.

219
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:37,335
You at least tell the tenants.

220
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,871
You don't just sit around hoping
that the building doesn't fall down.

221
00:08:39,906 --> 00:08:41,873
'Cause guess what. It's gonna fall down.

222
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:42,807
Yeah.

223
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:50,548
That's my niece. That's Marissa.

224
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,816
Okay. Okay. Just give me a second.

225
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:53,885
10:30 this morning,
a five-story apartment building

226
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,754
collapsed near downtown Seattle.

227
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:57,656
Okay, uh, Marissa's got a broken femur.

228
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,391
She's in post-op. I can show
you where she is, all right?

229
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:00,959
Experts believe the building...

230
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:04,062
Yes, that's my husband.
He threw up blood?

231
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:05,764
Charlie threw up blood?

232
00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:07,132
Yes, your husband has a gastric injury

233
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,400
and a tear in his diaphragm.

234
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:09,501
Oh, my God.

235
00:09:09,535 --> 00:09:12,804
Dr. Riggs and I will be taking
him up to the O.R. now.

236
00:09:12,838 --> 00:09:14,773
How did this happen?
W-What happened to him?

237
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:17,008
Your husband was in your apartment
when the building collapsed.

238
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:18,810
We don't live in an apartment.

239
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:20,946
Well, I'm sorry.

240
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,747
Uh, I'll update you, okay?

241
00:09:28,387 --> 00:09:29,454
There he is.

242
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,959
Yeah, that's the guy.
We're gonna take him right up.

243
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:36,628
We were just in bed one minute.

244
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:38,997
Then the whole world caved in.

245
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:43,768
I don't know why I was okay
and he was hurt so badly.

246
00:09:43,803 --> 00:09:45,804
Look, I'll update you
as soon as we know.

247
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,140
Thank you.

248
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:53,993
Uh, I updated Charlie's wife.

249
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,947
Charlie's wife?

250
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:57,265
Yep.

251
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:02,220
Charlie's married? Our patient Charlie?

252
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:04,022
What's the matter with you?

253
00:10:04,056 --> 00:10:06,157
I just updated Charlie's girlfriend.

254
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:12,416
Oh.

255
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:15,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's okay. It's okay.

256
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:16,901
Hey, I need some oxygen over here.

257
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:19,337
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

258
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:21,039
Take some deep breaths,
deep breaths. Deep.

259
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:22,974
O2 is right here.

260
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,710
Okay.

261
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:27,645
It's okay. It's okay.

262
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,980
Lungs are clear.

263
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:30,015
Okay, make fists with your toes.

264
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:32,050
Tight, tight, tight, tight,
tight, tight fists.

265
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,487
Good job.

266
00:10:37,757 --> 00:10:39,324
Wow. I haven't seen that one before.

267
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:41,526
Slow, deep breaths.
It just distracts them.

268
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,762
- It's your first day?
- Sort of.

269
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:45,897
Just jumping in where I can.

270
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:47,232
Well, welcome.

271
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:48,833
Thanks, Dr. Robbins.

272
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:51,102
Told you I wouldn't forget.

273
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:51,903
Forget?

274
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:53,071
Your name.

275
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:54,105
Huh?

276
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,740
You don't remember.

277
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:58,276
Wow. Okay. Uh, forget it.

278
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,712
I just... Last time I saw you,
I said you had a name

279
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:02,747
I couldn't forget, and so I thought...

280
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:04,215
- Oh. I'm sorry. I don't...
- No.

281
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,709
It's fine.

282
00:11:05,744 --> 00:11:07,069
- I'm sorry.
- It's nothing.

283
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:08,566
It's nothing.

284
00:11:09,722 --> 00:11:12,261
Did you see that?
Did you see me winning?

285
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:18,341
You're saying he knew? Micah?

286
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:20,089
That's what we heard...
that for almost a year,

287
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:21,590
he knew that there was
earthquake damage,

288
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,125
and he didn't do anything about it!

289
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,660
What he did is criminal!
It's negligence!

290
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:25,861
No, no. Murder's what it is.

291
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:27,997
I heard Rhonda Coley didn't
even make it out of surgery.

292
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:29,265
He can't get away with this!

293
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:30,332
Harry. Harry. He won't!

294
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:31,600
If I have a say, he won't!

295
00:11:31,635 --> 00:11:33,169
Harry, Harry, the doctors are here.

296
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:39,441
Hi.

297
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:40,609
How is she?

298
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:42,444
Winnie's injuries are very severe.

299
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,547
Most urgently,
she's bleeding into her chest.

300
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:46,949
The tube we placed
is still draining blood.

301
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:49,351
So we'll need to operate
on her right away.

302
00:11:49,386 --> 00:11:53,022
A-And then she's gonna be okay, right?

303
00:11:55,992 --> 00:11:59,461
Hey, hey. What'd they say?

304
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:00,963
- How's Winnie?
- She's in surgery right now.

305
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:03,065
Look, he is not gonna
get away with this!

306
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:04,900
That's exactly what I'm trying to...

307
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:08,571
Are you kidding me?

308
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:10,639
I do not like the vibe here.

309
00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:23,586
Did you hear that I was subpoenaed?

310
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,921
Uh, yeah, I...

311
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,379
My attorney's really good.
She says that...

312
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,341
Probably... I don't...

313
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:31,047
I don't think that we should
talk about it.

314
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:32,595
Yeah, I-I don't want to.

315
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:34,296
It's just...

316
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:37,666
after tomorrow, we might not get
a chance to talk.

317
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:39,468
I might not see you after.

318
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:43,205
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

319
00:12:43,874 --> 00:12:46,308
Alex, you've said that. I know.

320
00:12:46,343 --> 00:12:47,914
I mean for the things I said.

321
00:12:49,206 --> 00:12:50,606
You're not trash.

322
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:52,633
Don't ever let anyone say that.

323
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:57,486
I'm sorry, and I...

324
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:03,859
You're not trash, Jo.

325
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:18,513
Dr. Dominick, extension 2501.

326
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,082
Dr. Dominick, extension 2501.

327
00:13:21,117 --> 00:13:22,384
Dr. Minnick.

328
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:23,685
- Oh.
- You're here.

329
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,517
Not yet. I start Monday.

330
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,573
I'm just volunteering today,
helping out where I can.

331
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,322
That's so cool.

332
00:13:30,355 --> 00:13:32,323
It doesn't look like we'll
get our cup of coffee now.

333
00:13:32,357 --> 00:13:34,325
I can send you some papers if you want.

334
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:36,260
And, you know, you'll just be observing

335
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:38,596
the first few days anyway,
getting a sense of how it works.

336
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,364
That'll actually help
with the transition.

337
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:43,334
Transition? I thought you two
were working together.

338
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:46,003
Y-Yes, we are.

339
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:49,340
Has Dr. Bailey spoken with you?

340
00:13:49,374 --> 00:13:50,941
You know what?

341
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:52,808
I think you and I should sit down...

342
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,368
You should talk to Dr. Bailey.

343
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,674
They're closing in O.R. 4. We're next.

344
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:06,928
Right on. So, what do we do here?

345
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:08,767
Well, I don't think we need
a mesh for the diaphragm,

346
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:10,097
- just a running nylon suture.
- No, no, no, no.

347
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:12,133
Are we supposed to update this
guy's wife and girlfriend

348
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,801
separately, hope they never meet?

349
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:14,869
Do we sell them out,

350
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:16,644
or are we enabling some guy
to cheat on his wife?

351
00:14:16,678 --> 00:14:18,205
We don't have to do anything.

352
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,308
You cheat on your wife, it's
gonna come back to bite you.

353
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:29,317
We had our own problems.

354
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:30,851
Megan and I.

355
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:32,420
That's what you're saying, right?

356
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,989
But we had problems,
and we were working on them.

357
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:36,657
And I'm not just making excuses,

358
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:39,427
but you weren't in our thing,
so you don't know.

359
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,128
Riggs...

360
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:43,264
And you hold me responsible.
I know that.

361
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:46,834
But I promise you can't judge me harsher

362
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:48,803
than I judge myself every day.

363
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:52,072
It's a life sentence, mate.

364
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:55,309
And you...

365
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:58,375
Well, maybe you can't understand
that 'cause you're...

366
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,115
Well, you'd never do it.

367
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:03,351
You're better than that.

368
00:15:03,385 --> 00:15:05,252
You're better than me.
You always have been.

369
00:15:06,588 --> 00:15:08,175
I'm not better.

370
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:13,604
I've made my mistakes.

371
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:15,296
Not...

372
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:17,035
Yeah.

373
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,164
You cheated?

374
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:22,306
On Shepherd?

375
00:15:23,484 --> 00:15:24,618
On my first wife.

376
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:32,020
She made it sound like
you're stepping down.

377
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:34,315
You're not stepping down.

378
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,584
Have you talked to Dr. Bailey?

379
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:39,253
I tried paging her.
She's in surgeries all day.

380
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:41,355
Eliza Minnick needs to stop talking

381
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,524
like she is running this program
if she's not.

382
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:47,128
Okay, Maggie, I will talk to Dr. Bailey.

383
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:54,524
How's she doing?

384
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:56,737
The hilum's clamped,
but the P.A. is still bleeding.

385
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:58,172
Edwards, suction.

386
00:15:58,206 --> 00:16:01,342
I saw Dr. Minnick earlier.
She's here already.

387
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:02,613
Lap pads.

388
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,548
That's awesome.

389
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:08,382
Edwards, more lap pads.

390
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:13,945
So, I was thinking, in honor of that,

391
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:16,488
do you think maybe I could
have a shot at repairing...

392
00:16:16,513 --> 00:16:17,758
You're not doing a repair.

393
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,285
I've assisted Dr. Pierce and you.

394
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:20,840
Dr. Minnick would say
I'm more than ready.

395
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:23,197
But Dr. Minnick would not say
that you could do this one

396
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:24,484
because I've done over a thousand,

397
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,732
and this one's not holding.

398
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:27,768
And if I can't, you sure as hell can't.

399
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,966
Father?

400
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,375
S-Sir...

401
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:36,310
I thought I was gonna be dead.

402
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:37,311
No, sir.

403
00:16:37,345 --> 00:16:38,813
I knew all those people...

404
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:41,282
the Goldmans, the Richters,
the Flemings.

405
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:42,650
I heard their stories.

406
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:44,952
I heard their problems,
their little victories.

407
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:47,822
I saw their children
come home from the hospital...

408
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:50,624
Elliot, David, Winnie.

409
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:53,427
They were my family, these people.

410
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:56,230
That place... how was I gonna fix it?

411
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:57,431
Couldn't raise their... their rent.

412
00:16:57,466 --> 00:17:00,067
Some of them couldn't pay me already.

413
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,836
Sir, I-I'm not a priest.

414
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,804
I know. I don't care.

415
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,240
I just need someone to forgive me.

416
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:09,844
I need them to know how sorry I am

417
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:11,846
and to forgive me.

418
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,776
Will you, please?

419
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:16,075
Will you?

420
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:18,510
Will you forgive me?

421
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:21,088
Please?

422
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:24,992
Sir?

423
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:28,362
I need an intubation kit!

424
00:17:30,065 --> 00:17:33,868
Pierce, try to gain control
more proximally.

425
00:17:37,205 --> 00:17:38,439
Pressure's dropping.

426
00:17:38,473 --> 00:17:40,875
Come on! Come on! Pierce, I can't see.

427
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,480
Damn it!

428
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:50,351
Ah, she's bleeding out. Damn it.

429
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,128
Damn it. Damn it! She's in V-fib.

430
00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:55,223
Get a crash cart.

431
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:29,857
Charge to 200.

432
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,863
Charge again!

433
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,370
Hey.

434
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:44,658
Hey.

435
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,941
I'm married.

436
00:20:48,563 --> 00:20:50,141
What?

437
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,701
I'm married.

438
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,046
What the hell are you talking about?

439
00:20:58,506 --> 00:21:00,040
Since before I met you.

440
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:02,843
And I should have told you.

441
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:07,548
But I'm married to a guy
who almost beat me to death.

442
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:11,282
And I can't divorce him

443
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:13,907
because I ran away from him.

444
00:21:15,623 --> 00:21:17,349
And I'm not...

445
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:23,530
Jo Wilson isn't my real name.

446
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:27,525
That's why I couldn't marry you.

447
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,605
That's how this whole thing
started, and...

448
00:21:32,774 --> 00:21:35,242
I should have told you.

449
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:43,708
You're married.

450
00:21:48,456 --> 00:21:49,790
Yes.

451
00:21:49,824 --> 00:21:50,991
And you didn't tell me.

452
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,794
I was scared. I...

453
00:21:53,828 --> 00:21:54,928
Scared of what?

454
00:21:56,164 --> 00:21:57,694
Did you think I'd get mad?

455
00:21:57,728 --> 00:21:59,299
You thought I'd get mad at you
for trying to get yourself out...

456
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:00,401
No, not at me... at him.

457
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:01,902
I-I thought you'd want to kill him

458
00:22:01,936 --> 00:22:03,570
and that you'd try something stupid

459
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:07,041
and you'd get hurt or killed
or you'd get in trouble

460
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,742
and you... you would...

461
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:10,611
Wind up in jail.

462
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:18,371
It might all come out in court tomorrow.

463
00:22:20,202 --> 00:22:22,523
I wanted you to hear it from me.

464
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:49,349
After the trial, if I just take off,

465
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:52,119
if I leave, it's not because of you.

466
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:53,854
It's because my testimony

467
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:56,356
will be a matter of record or whatever.

468
00:22:56,391 --> 00:23:01,795
But I don't want you to think
that it's you... ever.

469
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,246
Hey.

470
00:23:07,902 --> 00:23:10,637
Don't go anywhere,
no matter what happens, okay?

471
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:13,607
I don't want him to find me.

472
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:15,309
He can't find me.

473
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:16,810
This is your life.

474
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:19,613
You're Jo Wilson. You belong here.

475
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:36,735
Is she okay?

476
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,937
Sit down.

477
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:16,909
Sponge stick.

478
00:24:17,944 --> 00:24:20,646
How did I not know that
you were married before?

479
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,914
Mm.

480
00:24:21,948 --> 00:24:23,482
- She moved to Finland?
- Switzerland.

481
00:24:23,516 --> 00:24:24,850
Suction.

482
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:28,320
We wanted different things.

483
00:24:28,354 --> 00:24:31,290
I wanted a kid. She did not want a kid.

484
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:33,025
No middle ground, no compromise.

485
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,027
Either/or.

486
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:39,198
And here I am again...
different person, same place.

487
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:40,465
I'm right there again.

488
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,934
Yeah, no, you're not.

489
00:24:41,968 --> 00:24:44,369
You've been there once.
Now you know better.

490
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,982
Hey! How's the kid?

491
00:24:57,016 --> 00:24:58,984
The hyperventilating kid.

492
00:24:59,018 --> 00:25:00,219
Fine.

493
00:25:00,253 --> 00:25:01,820
Oh.

494
00:25:03,556 --> 00:25:05,123
I like girls.

495
00:25:05,158 --> 00:25:08,126
What? Oh. Okay.

496
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:10,329
I mean, I feel like you
can't tell or something,

497
00:25:10,363 --> 00:25:12,397
that I like women,
that I'm flirting with you.

498
00:25:12,432 --> 00:25:14,633
You're not getting it,
and I'm really good at this.

499
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:17,402
I have game, which means
either you're not into women

500
00:25:17,437 --> 00:25:20,239
and the world is upside-down
bonkers, because I know,

501
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:23,709
or you're not into me and
I'm totally deluding myself.

502
00:25:23,743 --> 00:25:24,910
No.

503
00:25:26,212 --> 00:25:27,746
You are not deluding yourself.

504
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,214
I'm not?

505
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:31,550
No. I am a human rainbow.

506
00:25:31,584 --> 00:25:33,552
And you do. You've got a lot of game.

507
00:25:33,586 --> 00:25:35,887
You have a very sexy...

508
00:25:35,922 --> 00:25:38,824
somethin'-somethin' going on,
believe me.

509
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:41,560
But there's a thing
about you that bugged me.

510
00:25:41,594 --> 00:25:43,929
You walk around like you own
the place. It's annoying.

511
00:25:43,963 --> 00:25:46,064
Mm. It's charming.

512
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:50,602
Do you want to grab a drink some time?

513
00:25:50,637 --> 00:25:54,072
See? That. That is what I mean.

514
00:25:54,107 --> 00:25:55,374
No, I do not want to grab
a drink with you.

515
00:25:55,408 --> 00:25:57,943
Yes. Yes, you do.

516
00:25:57,977 --> 00:25:59,444
Shut up. Fine.
I'll have a drink with you.

517
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:02,014
And I promise you will not regret it.

518
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:04,283
Go away.

519
00:26:10,123 --> 00:26:11,723
Who's next?

520
00:26:11,758 --> 00:26:13,292
Splenic lac with blood in the abdomen.

521
00:26:13,326 --> 00:26:15,060
We had to resuscitate her in trauma.

522
00:26:15,094 --> 00:26:16,962
Show me.

523
00:26:17,588 --> 00:26:18,640
Okay.

524
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:21,284
Finish up prepping her for an
ex-lap, and I'll be right in.

525
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:23,902
Mer, you got a sec?

526
00:26:23,936 --> 00:26:26,772
No. Not really.
Unless you want to scrub in.

527
00:26:26,806 --> 00:26:28,040
- I won't tell Bailey.
- No.

528
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,708
Well, you're not gonna start

529
00:26:29,742 --> 00:26:31,043
with the end-of-the-world
crap again, are you?

530
00:26:31,077 --> 00:26:32,577
Jo's married.

531
00:26:32,612 --> 00:26:34,946
W-Wait. What?

532
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:36,448
She's married, and she's freaking out

533
00:26:36,482 --> 00:26:38,050
that she has to take the stand tomorrow

534
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:39,418
and testify and put herself on the line.

535
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:41,787
Herself on the line? This is your trial.

536
00:26:41,821 --> 00:26:43,388
Your life is on the line.

537
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:44,489
Look, she's scared, Mer.

538
00:26:44,524 --> 00:26:46,058
What are you even saying right now?

539
00:26:46,092 --> 00:26:48,060
I-I just need to figure out what to do.

540
00:26:48,094 --> 00:26:50,929
Figure what out? You're not even
making any sense right now.

541
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:52,464
You don't know the whole story.

542
00:26:52,498 --> 00:26:53,832
Okay. So tell it to me.

543
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:56,101
Dr. Grey, her B.P. is 90/40.

544
00:26:56,135 --> 00:26:58,103
Okay, so hang two units.
I'll be right there.

545
00:26:58,137 --> 00:26:59,471
You should go.

546
00:26:59,505 --> 00:27:00,906
- I...
- Dr. Grey.

547
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,442
Yes. I'm coming. We're not done.

548
00:27:03,476 --> 00:27:05,644
When this surgery is over,
I'm going to page you.

549
00:27:05,678 --> 00:27:07,569
You're gonna come back and tell
me the rest of the story, okay?

550
00:27:07,594 --> 00:27:09,414
- Go.
- Come back.

551
00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:46,852
Ma'am, can I help you?

552
00:27:48,688 --> 00:27:53,091
Uh... I'm looking for my h-husband.

553
00:27:56,195 --> 00:27:59,931
Good. Uh, yeah, he could...
he could use some company.

554
00:28:03,603 --> 00:28:05,537
You haven't spoken to
the chief yet, have you?

555
00:28:05,571 --> 00:28:07,005
It's fine.

556
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,673
No, it's not fine.

557
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:09,808
What Dr. Minnick said is not fine.

558
00:28:09,842 --> 00:28:12,210
- It sounds like she's taking your job!
- No. Pierce...

559
00:28:12,245 --> 00:28:14,846
And what's worse is it sounds
like nobody has told you.

560
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:16,415
Maggie.

561
00:28:16,449 --> 00:28:18,150
Let me in!

562
00:28:20,052 --> 00:28:21,086
Oh, no.

563
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,255
Just let us in.

564
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:25,323
I need you all to calm down.

565
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:26,491
I have a right to know where he is!

566
00:28:26,526 --> 00:28:27,759
I'm so sorry. You don't have that right.

567
00:28:27,794 --> 00:28:29,027
And I can't give you that information.

568
00:28:29,061 --> 00:28:30,095
He killed my little girl!

569
00:28:30,129 --> 00:28:31,029
Please step back! Step back!

570
00:28:31,063 --> 00:28:32,864
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Now, what is the problem?

571
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:34,666
They're looking for the landlord.

572
00:28:44,277 --> 00:28:47,712
He's intubated right now,
but he was talking earlier.

573
00:28:47,747 --> 00:28:49,214
He had a tough time.

574
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:52,250
Uh, he was...
he was asking for a priest.

575
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:56,841
Thank you, Doctor.

576
00:28:59,492 --> 00:29:02,360
Uh, I'll leave you two alone.

577
00:29:10,503 --> 00:29:12,304
- Get out of our way!
- Move. Move now!

578
00:29:12,338 --> 00:29:14,306
No one is hunting down a patient
in my hospital.

579
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,907
You want to get the hell
out of my way right now!

580
00:29:15,942 --> 00:29:17,642
Harry. She's gone.

581
00:29:17,677 --> 00:29:19,778
No!

582
00:29:19,812 --> 00:29:22,581
Winnie is gone. This is not
going to bring her back.

583
00:29:22,615 --> 00:29:25,150
You'll go to jail.

584
00:29:25,184 --> 00:29:27,919
And then your wife will lose
you both. This will not help.

585
00:29:27,954 --> 00:29:29,187
Oh, my God.

586
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:33,058
She's gone.

587
00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:35,660
Security! Security! We need security!

588
00:29:35,695 --> 00:29:37,095
No, please.

589
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:38,296
Damn it.

590
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:40,065
Up the O2 100%.

591
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:42,801
What happened?

592
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:44,669
She tried to disconnect his vents.

593
00:29:44,704 --> 00:29:46,271
She tried to suffocate him.
She tried to kill him.

594
00:29:46,305 --> 00:29:48,173
Someone has to be responsible.

595
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:50,175
He knew it.

596
00:29:50,209 --> 00:29:53,650
He has to be held responsible
for this. Please.

597
00:30:05,652 --> 00:30:06,852
Ohh.

598
00:30:06,886 --> 00:30:08,787
I have been in O.R. all day.

599
00:30:08,822 --> 00:30:11,390
Well, you missed some things.

600
00:30:13,426 --> 00:30:17,663
Oh, Ben feels terrible, says
he led the woman right to him.

601
00:30:17,697 --> 00:30:19,698
Oh, she would have found him on her own.

602
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:22,001
Ben saved his life, is what he did.

603
00:30:24,237 --> 00:30:26,171
Uh, I heard you were looking for me.

604
00:30:29,342 --> 00:30:33,245
Bailey, who's running this
program... me or Eliza Minnick?

605
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,482
I planned to tell you today.

606
00:30:36,516 --> 00:30:40,386
Then she showed up early,
and all of this...

607
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,987
- Today.
- Mm.

608
00:30:42,022 --> 00:30:43,756
Planned to tell me today?

609
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,592
And you'd have tomorrow and the weekend

610
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:52,498
to adjust to the situation,
have your feelings,

611
00:30:52,532 --> 00:30:54,400
start fresh on Monday.

612
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:59,605
That was me.

613
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:02,126
That's how I taught you
how to fire people.

614
00:31:02,146 --> 00:31:03,623
N-No. No one's getting fired.

615
00:31:03,657 --> 00:31:05,524
Yeah, right. But she'll
be running the program.

616
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,693
She's the Curriculum Director.

617
00:31:07,728 --> 00:31:10,501
You are the Chairman
of the Residency Program.

618
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,664
You're overseeing the whole thing.

619
00:31:11,698 --> 00:31:13,766
But I'm ornamental, and you know it.

620
00:31:14,184 --> 00:31:15,868
You didn't want to discuss it with me.

621
00:31:15,902 --> 00:31:17,003
You don't want to hear my opinions

622
00:31:17,037 --> 00:31:20,072
about a program that I built,
that I trained you in.

623
00:31:21,174 --> 00:31:22,208
That's not respect.

624
00:31:22,242 --> 00:31:23,976
I made a decision

625
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:27,113
about what is best for
the hospital moving forward,

626
00:31:27,147 --> 00:31:29,515
and I didn't want my personal feelings,

627
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:31,951
my very strong personal feelings

628
00:31:31,985 --> 00:31:35,321
to get in the way of that decision.

629
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:37,690
If I do that...

630
00:31:37,724 --> 00:31:40,424
I won't be able to do this job.

631
00:31:43,096 --> 00:31:44,328
Bailey...

632
00:31:45,576 --> 00:31:48,167
we reach into people's bodies

633
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:51,404
and hold their lives and
their futures in our hands.

634
00:31:51,438 --> 00:31:55,207
There's nothing more personal
than this job,

635
00:31:55,242 --> 00:31:58,210
in how we treat a patient,

636
00:31:58,245 --> 00:32:00,179
in how we raise our doctors

637
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:03,049
and teach them how to do this work.

638
00:32:04,518 --> 00:32:07,953
Every decision that you make
should be a personal one.

639
00:32:09,523 --> 00:32:12,658
If it isn't, then you have
no business being chief.

640
00:32:30,143 --> 00:32:32,319
- Hey, do you have a second?
- Not really.

641
00:32:32,353 --> 00:32:33,756
Look, I don't want
to put you on the spot,

642
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,478
but you're on the board
of this hospital.

643
00:32:35,512 --> 00:32:37,211
Almost done here. You're doing great.

644
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:38,858
You're an Avery. It's an Avery hospital.

645
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:40,527
Land the plane, Pierce.

646
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:42,862
Eliza Minnick works here now.

647
00:32:42,897 --> 00:32:44,164
I'm aware.

648
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:45,999
She thinks she's the new
Residency Director,

649
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:47,634
like she's Richard Webber's boss.

650
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:50,637
Minnick said that?

651
00:32:56,911 --> 00:32:58,678
What is it, Karev?

652
00:32:58,712 --> 00:33:01,581
I need to adjust my pension account.

653
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:03,683
I need it signed over
so the money goes to my mom.

654
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:06,698
Can you set that up for me?

655
00:33:06,732 --> 00:33:08,221
What are you talking about?

656
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:11,124
Can you send it to my mom
every month, please?

657
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,208
You don't think it's
gonna go well tomorrow.

658
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,767
Karev, what are you about to do?

659
00:33:20,801 --> 00:33:22,735
You were right about the clinic.

660
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,704
It got my head back in the game.

661
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:27,407
You are not leaving this office

662
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:30,561
until you tell me what is going on.

663
00:33:58,073 --> 00:34:00,373
Okay, you have five minutes. Let's go.

664
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:04,444
I'm going to the district
attorney's tonight,

665
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:06,079
and I'm gonna take the plea he offered.

666
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:08,001
Okay, that's not funny.

667
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,085
What are you talking about?

668
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,288
I'm gonna plead out.
I'll be gone two years.

669
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:16,756
I just... I just wanted to say...

670
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,119
You're not doing this.

671
00:34:18,154 --> 00:34:20,387
I am. It's my choice.

672
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:22,595
Why? Because of Jo?

673
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,597
No. Because I did it.

674
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:25,665
And I'm gonna go say I did it.

675
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,300
No, you're not.

676
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:29,248
Look, it'd save everyone
a lot of time and trouble.

677
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:31,626
Alex, you're gonna go home
and get a good night's sleep.

678
00:34:32,106 --> 00:34:34,274
- And then tomorrow...
- There's not gonna be a tomorrow.

679
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:35,942
Yeah. Tomorrow you're
gonna go into the court,

680
00:34:35,977 --> 00:34:37,444
and you're gonna tell them who you are,

681
00:34:37,478 --> 00:34:39,880
that you're a surgeon
who saves children,

682
00:34:39,914 --> 00:34:42,516
that you make waffles for children,

683
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,284
that you did one stupid thing.

684
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:46,887
And you will face whatever it is
you have to face,

685
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:48,422
but you are not going to throw yourself

686
00:34:48,456 --> 00:34:52,259
on the mercy of whatever
and walk into prison, okay?

687
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:53,427
You'll be okay.

688
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:57,431
Me? This is about you.

689
00:34:57,465 --> 00:34:59,733
You think this is noble,
what you're doing?

690
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:01,635
It isn't. It's giving up.

691
00:35:01,669 --> 00:35:04,304
And it's buying into everything
you've ever said about yourself,

692
00:35:04,338 --> 00:35:05,539
and I won't let you do it.

693
00:35:05,573 --> 00:35:06,807
Look. You'll be fine.

694
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:08,542
You are not going to jail.

695
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:10,944
You'll be just fine.

696
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:12,546
Stop making this about me!

697
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,248
Stop using me as an excuse
to make yourself feel better.

698
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:17,417
Of course I will be fine.

699
00:35:17,452 --> 00:35:19,619
I'm always fine. Don't you know that?

700
00:35:20,247 --> 00:35:22,589
This is about you.

701
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:24,491
You will be destroyed.

702
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:27,127
Your life, your career, everything...

703
00:35:27,528 --> 00:35:29,362
will be finished.

704
00:35:30,598 --> 00:35:32,265
Who you are will be gone.

705
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:39,339
I'd hug you goodbye,
but I'm not scrubbed.

706
00:35:39,373 --> 00:35:41,108
Well, because this isn't goodbye, Alex.

707
00:35:41,142 --> 00:35:43,910
You don't walk in here when
I'm in the middle of a surgery.

708
00:35:43,945 --> 00:35:46,413
Dr. Grey? We're ready for you in the...

709
00:35:46,447 --> 00:35:48,181
- I need a minute.
- Kiss the kids for me.

710
00:35:48,216 --> 00:35:51,518
No, Alex. Alex, you're not
gonna walk out of here.

711
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:53,487
- Dr. Grey.
- I heard you!

712
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:55,789
Goodbye, Mer.

713
00:35:56,991 --> 00:35:58,625
Alex!

714
00:36:16,796 --> 00:36:18,462
- He did very well.
- Your husband came through just great.

715
00:36:18,496 --> 00:36:20,353
- Everything went just fine.
- He's awake and responsive.

716
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,255
- Can I see him?
- When can I see him?

717
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:24,743
Don't see why not.

718
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,694
As soon as you'd like.
I'll get a nurse, okay?

719
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,162
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

720
00:36:30,197 --> 00:36:32,532
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

721
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:33,733
Not our business, right?

722
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:36,035
Not our business.

723
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,504
If you want to grab a beer...

724
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:40,806
Actually...

725
00:36:40,841 --> 00:36:42,909
I want to go home and see my wife.

726
00:36:43,613 --> 00:36:45,144
I get it.

727
00:36:45,178 --> 00:36:47,146
Another time? Rain check.

728
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,214
Right on.

729
00:36:50,183 --> 00:36:51,484
Hey, let me know how it goes, huh?

730
00:36:51,518 --> 00:36:53,052
Yeah.

731
00:36:55,689 --> 00:36:57,523
They don't get to make this decision.

732
00:36:57,558 --> 00:36:59,258
There is nothing wrong
with this program,

733
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:01,998
- and it is totally disrespectful to you.
- Maggie...

734
00:37:02,032 --> 00:37:03,396
And if they want a fight,
they can have it.

735
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,864
I am not scared.

736
00:37:04,898 --> 00:37:08,167
Maggie! Look, I appreciate it.

737
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:09,854
But, um...

738
00:37:10,237 --> 00:37:12,538
I'm not sure this is a fight I can win.

739
00:37:12,573 --> 00:37:14,540
I'll fight with you.

740
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:18,411
I'm touched that you want to.

741
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:21,013
I really am.

742
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,317
Come here.

743
00:37:25,252 --> 00:37:29,221
Look, I know a lot of you guys
didn't come up in this program.

744
00:37:29,256 --> 00:37:31,057
But I did. April did.

745
00:37:31,091 --> 00:37:33,025
And the difference between the education

746
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,227
that we got at Mercy West
and what we got under Webber?

747
00:37:35,262 --> 00:37:37,263
- No, there's no comparison.
- This is ridiculous.

748
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,464
He is the program.

749
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:42,602
So, if you guys
are as pissed as we are...

750
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:45,371
- Yes!
- ...and you really, really should be...

751
00:37:48,108 --> 00:37:51,444
See? It's not just me.

752
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,590
Hey.

753
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:08,894
You okay?

754
00:38:11,418 --> 00:38:13,085
You want to talk about it?

755
00:38:15,302 --> 00:38:18,037
I know. I know. Church and state.

756
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:22,081
No.

757
00:38:23,143 --> 00:38:24,310
No.

758
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:27,847
To hell with church and state.

759
00:38:27,881 --> 00:38:30,182
It's not working. It's not worth it.

760
00:38:30,217 --> 00:38:33,285
It's not how to do this job.

761
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,255
I need to talk to you about something.

762
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:39,158
Okay, okay, look, I-I didn't
impersonate a priest exactly.

763
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:42,361
Wh-What... No.
I-I'm not talking about...

764
00:38:42,876 --> 00:38:44,309
Wait. What?

765
00:38:44,537 --> 00:38:46,571
What are you talking about?

766
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:50,313
Alex Karev.

767
00:38:54,174 --> 00:38:55,796
- Hey.
- Oh. Sorry.

768
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,710
- Where... Where are you going?
- I have to leave.

769
00:38:57,744 --> 00:38:59,211
I got put on a case.

770
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:01,480
But, um, do you want
to see something gross?

771
00:39:01,515 --> 00:39:04,216
Look, um, about tomorrow...

772
00:39:04,251 --> 00:39:05,184
Oh. I told Alex.

773
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:08,020
I told him everything.
And you were right.

774
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:11,957
I should have told him right
away because it was okay.

775
00:39:11,992 --> 00:39:15,173
And we are... we're...

776
00:39:16,196 --> 00:39:18,330
I just feel like
whatever happens tomorrow

777
00:39:18,365 --> 00:39:21,567
is gonna happen, and I'm not worried.

778
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:24,296
Not gonna worry. I feel okay.

779
00:39:25,592 --> 00:39:27,159
Well, uh...

780
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,741
I'm sorry. I have to go.

781
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:31,143
- Right.
- Okay.

782
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:49,060
You're here to see
the district attorney.

783
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:50,261
Is he expecting you?

784
00:39:50,296 --> 00:39:51,621
Uh, tell him it's Alex Karev.

785
00:39:51,646 --> 00:39:53,512
I'm the defendant in the trial tomorrow.

786
00:39:53,593 --> 00:39:54,460
I'll let him know.

787
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:07,072
Alex, listen to me.

788
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:27,860
Grab my phone and call Alex Karev

789
00:40:27,894 --> 00:40:30,229
and put it on speaker for me, please.

790
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:36,101
You've just reached Dr. Alex Karev.

791
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:38,270
I'm not here right now,
so leave a message.

792
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:39,905
Alex, listen to me.

793
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:43,042
You're better than this.
You're stronger.

794
00:40:43,848 --> 00:40:45,544
"Don't make this all your fault.

795
00:40:46,615 --> 00:40:48,614
I know you.

796
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:51,617
That's what you do.

797
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,426
But, please.

798
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:01,160
Please don't do that."

799
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:07,266
We can't just give up,
not after all this time.

800
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,001
We have to stand together.

801
00:41:09,035 --> 00:41:10,470
We have to fight.

802
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:14,606
Because it's just us now.

803
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:18,510
There were five of us,
and now it's just you and I.

804
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:21,580
And it can't be just me. It can't be.

805
00:41:22,737 --> 00:41:24,984
I will go down swinging for you, Alex.

806
00:41:25,018 --> 00:41:26,819
You know I will.

807
00:41:26,853 --> 00:41:29,106
But that means you can't give up.

808
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:32,157
You don't throw the fight.

809
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:36,662
So, whatever you're doing this for...

810
00:41:36,696 --> 00:41:37,763
Mr. Karev?

811
00:41:37,797 --> 00:41:38,931
...please...

812
00:41:38,965 --> 00:41:40,499
He'll see you now.

813
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:42,034
...don't.

814
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:01,035
Mr. Karev?

815
00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:03,655
Mr. Karev?

816
00:42:09,122 --> 00:42:17,933

1
00:00:01,973 --> 00:00:04,068
Adrenaline is the body's response

2
00:00:04,093 --> 00:00:05,765
to stressful situations.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,257
Hey. Wait, wai... wait.

4
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:11,161
I proofread the presentation,
tested the A/V equipment.

5
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:12,863
David Bowie is performance-ready.

6
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:13,914
Excellent.

7
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:14,981
Where are you going?

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,366
I'm going to check on my post-ops.

9
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:17,734
- I'll be back soon.
- What?

10
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:20,070
Try to calm down.
You're gonna stress out Bowie.

11
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:27,177
It's one of many biochemical
compounds our bodies produce

12
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:29,379
- that alter our state of consciousness.
- Hey.

13
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:30,414
How long is this gonna take?

14
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:31,748
Well, it's gonna take
as long as it's gonna take.

15
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:33,083
We have 25 proposals.

16
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:36,620
This eliminates the need for a port.

17
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:37,721
That allows us to...

18
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:39,089
- Hey.
- No. No.

19
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,257
- Go away.
- Why?

20
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,264
I already lost sleep

21
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:42,450
- because of you last night.
- Did you?

22
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:43,736
- I'm trying to focus.
- Uh-huh.

23
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,003
- I'm trying to win.
- Yeah? Good luck with that.

24
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:48,198
Oxytocin makes us feel
bonded with others.

25
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:50,300
I'm going backstage.

26
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:52,202
Kepner said I could be
the first to present.

27
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:53,904
Then I'll head to Ollie's funeral.

28
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:55,539
Oh, I wish I could come with you.

29
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:56,807
It'll be all right.

30
00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:00,410
Dopamine makes us more alert

31
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:02,713
and motivates us to seek reward.

32
00:01:02,747 --> 00:01:05,482
Baby. Move this box down there.

33
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:07,227
Mom, if you wanted input,
you could have done that

34
00:01:07,262 --> 00:01:08,251
last week instead of being in Boston.

35
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:10,220
I was busy taking care of business.

36
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:11,254
So was Dr. Velez.

37
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:12,556
She had emergency surgery in I.A.

38
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,891
She still managed
to get her notes in on time.

39
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:16,793
- Over there.
- Thank you.

40
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:17,928
That's nasty.

41
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:20,664
- Hi. Cookie?
- Oh.

42
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:22,065
Whoa. Seriously?

43
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,935
- My girlfriend just got deported.
- Here.

44
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:27,904
A lack of serotonin
has been linked to depression.

45
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:29,406
You had time to make cookies?

46
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,275
They are lesbian gratitude cookies.

47
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,603
- What?
- Hm. Yeah.

48
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:34,656
I mean, that's what they call them.

49
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:36,084
Remember my patients who had the cancer

50
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:37,180
that turned out not to be cancer?

51
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:39,983
Mmm. Lesbian gratitude cookies
are delicious.

52
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,685
I think I can say that,
but I'm not so sure about you.

53
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,619
- Hi. Cookie?
- Hi.

54
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:45,455
Um, one of my patients
just went into labor.

55
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,959
If I don't make it back,
you got this. You're magic.

56
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:51,661
GABA, an amino-acid neurotransmitter,

57
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:53,964
helps reduce anxiety...

58
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:55,332
Ooh. Cookie?

59
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:59,136
Don't mind if I do.

60
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,470
Hmm.

61
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,309
And endorphins create

62
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:07,878
a heightened state of happiness.

63
00:02:07,912 --> 00:02:09,446
What? What are you doing here?

64
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,781
You're supposed to be rounding.

65
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:11,982
The future of medicine is in this room.

66
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:14,484
And that's why the grownups
get first dibs on the seats.

67
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,887
Here. Come on, let's go. I'm going, too.

68
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:19,456
- Hey, cookie?
- Um, no, I can't eat when I'm nervous.

69
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,024
- I'll throw up, but thank you.
- Hm.

70
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,193
...like the kind we feel when we win.

71
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,462
Morning and welcome

72
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:29,366
to Grey Sloan Surgical
Innovation Prototypes Day.

73
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,203
Today, we will see presentations
of the 25 proposals

74
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,205
that were chosen in round one.

75
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,142
Five will be selected to move on
to the contest's final phase

76
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:42,179
and receive a $1 million grant

77
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:45,182
to further their groundbreaking research.

78
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:46,917
Good luck to all of today's presenters.

79
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:50,687
And we will begin
with Dr. Richard Webber.

80
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,726
You're on deck.

81
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,028
Hey. Want some cookies?

82
00:02:58,062 --> 00:02:59,997
Sure. Thanks.

83
00:03:01,873 --> 00:03:03,400
Thank you.

84
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,586
Let's begin.

85
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,238
Now, once we identify the cancer,

86
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,406
we do everything we can...

87
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,707
You knew we had to present today.

88
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:11,957
We had a very clear deadline.

89
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,710
Yeah, well, cleaning up the mess you made

90
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:15,245
has no clear end at all.

91
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,713
What mess? What are you talking about?

92
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,248
The mess you made when you
decided to waive

93
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,584
Rebecca Froy's settlement
against your grandfather,

94
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,886
thereby allowing her
to speak publicly about it,

95
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,021
which sent our foundation's
board of directors

96
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,257
into a massive soaking
of their collective britches,

97
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,669
which I had to sop up. That mess.

98
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:32,062
What settlement are you talking about?

99
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:33,296
Sexual harassment.

100
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:34,798
To revolutionize the way that...

101
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:37,267
Close your mouth before you catch a fly.

102
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,869
Dr. Orr!

103
00:03:38,903 --> 00:03:40,126
We'll talk later.

104
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,457
Dr. Orr so nice to see you, darling.

105
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:49,713
So, when you apply
the Path Pen to tissue,

106
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:51,815
it rapidly identifies

107
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:56,052
whether a cell is healthy...

108
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:58,755
...or cancerous.

109
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:00,123
So you're showing us a mock-up?

110
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,458
No, no. It's functional.

111
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,560
I mean, it's still in the testing stage,

112
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:05,128
but, at this point,

113
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,664
approximately 80%
of all tumor types we sampled

114
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:09,099
are in the database,

115
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:11,635
and we hope for 100%
in the next few months.

116
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,084
- Wow. That is impressive.
- The Pen uses a...

117
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:16,840
Impressive? It's like
a drug-sniffing dog for cancer.

118
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:19,075
- We're screwed.
- Shh! Our idea's good, too.

119
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,577
...mass spectrometer,

120
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:22,679
which compares biomarkers from the tissue

121
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:24,925
with those of the cancer cells
in the database.

122
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,117
The device...

123
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:27,952
Hey, Peggy, Dayna.

124
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:29,454
What's going on? Are you okay?
Is... Is the baby okay?

125
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:30,955
No, no, no, we're fine. Rose is fine.

126
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:32,690
It's the cookies.

127
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:34,292
I'm sorry? You paged me 911.

128
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:35,526
- We're so sorry.
- We need the cookies back.

129
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:37,361
- We're so sorry.
- It was an accident.

130
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:38,696
Do you still have them? Please
say that you still have them.

131
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:40,331
The cookies? All of the cookies?

132
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:42,333
All the cookies, all of the cookies.

133
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,136
Current procedures use
a portion of the small intestine

134
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,645
but the result can still have
some practical limitations,

135
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:50,491
due to its ability to secrete fluid...

136
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:52,092
peritoneal tissue is a good choice

137
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,361
- for vaginal reconstruction...
- Hi. Um.

138
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:56,563
- Now let's look at slides.
- Could you, um...

139
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,888
do you see that cookie tin up there?

140
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,523
C-Could you go get those cookies for me?

141
00:04:59,558 --> 00:05:02,693
I'm a little, uh, wobbly. I can't.

142
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,196
I'm not going up there.

143
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,894
Go eat the cafeteria cookies

144
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,033
from the green room.

145
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,960
Okay.

146
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:12,462
Come here.

147
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:16,632
My patient accidentally
used peanut-butter cannabis

148
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:19,068
that her wife had got her when
she was going through chemo.

149
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:21,937
One thing led to another,
and, um, I seem to have given

150
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:24,273
a lot of people weed cookies,

151
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:26,409
um, with an unknown
and immeasurable amount

152
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:27,610
of weed in them.

153
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,614
The peritoneum naturally
regenerates within days.

154
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:34,784
She came to us with the idea...

155
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:37,053
Who had the cookies?

156
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,187
Who didn't?

157
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:40,089
And that's
when I told them, uh, you know,

158
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:43,659
I said, "Hey. We can make
a better vagina, you know?"

159
00:05:43,694 --> 00:05:45,061
I'm gonna go back.

160
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,962
That sounds, uh... That sounds wrong.

161
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:50,232
Vaginas are terrific
the way they are, honestly.

162
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,001
I love 'em, you know.

163
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:54,136
Um, I came from one, so...

164
00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:57,106
This one, hers, actually. Hey, Ma.

165
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,808
That's not what the script says.

166
00:05:58,842 --> 00:06:00,443
What do we do? What do we do?

167
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:03,145
What?

168
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,346
Oh, my God.

169
00:06:04,381 --> 00:06:05,848
This one.

170
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:11,253
This is bad.

172
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:25,146
Due to unforeseen circumstances,
we are postponing

173
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:26,705
the remainder of today's presentation.

174
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:28,073
Please raise your hand

175
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:30,842
if you ate any cookies from this tin.

176
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:36,448
Oh.

177
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:38,083
Unfortunately, the cookies in this tin

178
00:06:38,117 --> 00:06:40,252
were tainted with rat poison.

179
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,590
So we need to treat those of you
who have ingested them

180
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,260
as soon as possible, please.

181
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:54,633
Okay. False alarm.

182
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,268
The cookies had marijuana in them.

183
00:06:56,302 --> 00:06:57,435
What?!

184
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,104
Yes. I didn't want to scare you.

185
00:06:59,138 --> 00:07:00,205
So you went with rat poison?

186
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:01,573
You scared me to death.

187
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:03,475
- What?
- You knew they had weed in them.

188
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:06,278
Right. Yeah. I-I forgot.

189
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:07,612
Okay, so listen.

190
00:07:07,647 --> 00:07:09,614
No one goes anywhere until you're sober.

191
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:12,417
Ingesting marijuana
has a much stronger effect,

192
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:15,287
and it lasts much longer
than when you smoke it, so...

193
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:17,889
True story. We get kids
in the ER all the time...

194
00:07:17,924 --> 00:07:19,257
They had... had... They like the cookies

195
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:20,547
and the brownies and the candies.

196
00:07:20,582 --> 00:07:22,227
They should really label
that stuff better.

197
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:24,396
So everyone stays here.

198
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,800
There's no medicine, no surgery,
and no patient interaction.

199
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,835
Yeah, I... Yeah, I'm just
gonna send some orders.

200
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,337
No, you're not gonna send anything!

201
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:34,472
- Give your note to Jo.
- Wait. You're taking our phones?

202
00:07:34,507 --> 00:07:35,774
Everyone, give your phones to Wilson.

203
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:38,410
She will handle your patients,
your post-ops, and your charts.

204
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:39,611
So you're gonna do all of our work?

205
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:40,812
Yes, she's gonna reassess and rearrange.

206
00:07:40,846 --> 00:07:42,280
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It's gonna be great.

207
00:07:42,315 --> 00:07:44,983
You're so pretty. You look like a cartoon.

208
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:46,351
- Okay, okay.
- You should look into it.

209
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:47,953
- Phones now.
- Jackson.

210
00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:49,254
Everybody stay here.

211
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:50,255
Right.

212
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:52,857
- Let's go.
- Oh, my God.

213
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:55,093
Andrew?

214
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:57,195
Andrew, you in there?

215
00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:58,596
- Andrew?
- Who are we talking about?

216
00:07:58,631 --> 00:08:00,365
Hey, Andrew?

217
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,034
Pierce? Oh, God, Pi...
Andrew. Pi... Pierce!

218
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:06,938
Pierce? Hey, Pierce. Stop. Stop!

219
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:08,873
- Hey.
- They called.

220
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:10,709
They called, and they said
that he's coming today.

221
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:12,344
- I'm not ready.
- Wait.

222
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:13,480
Wait up. Who called?

223
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:15,737
DSHS. They're bringing me a foster kid.

224
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:16,829
- Today?
- Yeah.

225
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,149
I just had the home inspection,

226
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:19,351
and they said, "We'll call you."

227
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:20,251
I didn't think it would be this soon,

228
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:22,120
and now they're bringing me a baby boy.

229
00:08:22,154 --> 00:08:25,390
I said I could take ages zero to 17,

230
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:27,158
and they're bringing me zero.

231
00:08:27,193 --> 00:08:28,360
Well, that's amazing, right?

232
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:30,295
I just got off a 36-hour shift,

233
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:33,131
and I came home to sleep,
and I... I don't have anything.

234
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:34,366
You're gonna be fine.

235
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,367
Do you need me to come over and help?

236
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:36,701
No, no. No, no, no, no.

237
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:38,803
It's... T-This is what I wanted, and...

238
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:40,472
How soon can you get here?

239
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:42,383
- I'll be right over.
- Dr. Schwartz to the ER.

240
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:44,342
Hey. Hi. Have you seen Pierce?

241
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:46,745
No. What's with him?

242
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:48,546
A patient brought in
accidental weed cookies.

243
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:50,482
And he ate a lot of them.

244
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:51,574
And Pierce ate one, too.

245
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:53,051
Oh, my God. Yeah, I will help you look.

246
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:54,919
Let me, uh, call Owen and let him know

247
00:08:54,954 --> 00:08:56,354
I will be there as soon as I can.

248
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:57,355
Is Owen okay?

249
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,824
Yeah. He, uh... He's getting
a foster kid today.

250
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:04,229
Pierce. Pierce. Hey. Stop.

251
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:06,264
I... You... You go. I got this.

252
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:08,500
- You got this.
- Stop! Let's go.

253
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:10,769
Oh, come along. Hey, we got to go.

254
00:09:10,803 --> 00:09:11,569
Come on.

255
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:13,204
Come on. Got to go.

256
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:15,106
Hey, come on.

257
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:16,374
Hey, Pierce!

258
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:18,176
You're supposed to be in the theater.

259
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,011
I ate marijuana.

260
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:21,513
I know.

261
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:23,048
I never had marijuana before.

262
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:24,516
Oh, that's... Really?

263
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,218
I've been drunk before,
and... I-I make poor choices.

264
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:28,286
Really embarrassing choices
when I'm drunk.

265
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,455
- So I just need to be alone.
- No. No, no, no, no.

266
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:31,581
You have never been high before.

267
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:33,458
You need to be with people who...

268
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:36,059
who can help you and keep you safe.

269
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:37,796
I don't...

270
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,355
I don't think I need my neck anymore.

271
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,267
Okay, just... Here. Come here.

272
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:44,402
Just go in here.

273
00:09:44,437 --> 00:09:46,471
Oh, my God.

274
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:48,406
Can you come on?

275
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,978
Dr. Edell to the NICU.
Dr. Edell to the NICU.

276
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:55,369
- Alex?
- I figured out how to make

277
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:56,314
the ultrasound work.

278
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:59,150
It needs more water. A waterfall.

279
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:01,386
Uh, hold up, Dr. Frankenstein.

280
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,254
Did you eat cookies this morning?

281
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:06,291
Oh, yeah. It was so good.
Are there more cookies?

282
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:07,325
Or, uh, chips?

283
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:08,760
- Okay.
- You got chips?

284
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:11,262
You're just coming with me.

285
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:13,598
Okay, but why didn't you say anything?

286
00:10:13,632 --> 00:10:16,468
Mnh. Turns out there's
no good time to tell your son

287
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:19,003
that his grandfather
is a sexual predator.

288
00:10:19,038 --> 00:10:20,479
He isn't. He was.

289
00:10:20,513 --> 00:10:23,842
So... So the accusations
are accurate from Rebecca Frog?

290
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:25,009
Uh, Frond?

291
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:26,411
- Froy, Froy.
- Froy.

292
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:29,080
No, that's not right. It was like a...

293
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:30,648
Rebecca Froy's story was true.

294
00:10:30,683 --> 00:10:32,584
All the stories were true.

295
00:10:32,618 --> 00:10:33,618
Wait. What do you mean "all"?

296
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:35,520
You said "all."
"All the stories"? What's that?

297
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:38,523
There was many stories...
some ugly, some very ugly.

298
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:39,858
How many? How many stories?

299
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:42,994
- 13. 13 women... all under NDAs...
- 13?

300
00:10:43,028 --> 00:10:44,496
...all secret!

301
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,497
Shh!

302
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,799
This is bad. This is so bad.

303
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:51,769
This is indispensable...
fensible... indefensible.

304
00:10:51,804 --> 00:10:52,770
What are you looking for?

305
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:54,405
My glasses!

306
00:10:57,309 --> 00:10:59,043
Oh.

307
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:00,278
13, Mom?

308
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:01,646
13.

309
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,014
Some attendings

310
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:05,550
have unexpectedly become... unavailable.

311
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:07,118
You will be taking over their services...

312
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:09,387
rounding, charting,
whatever needs to get done.

313
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:10,955
This is a chance for you to step up.

314
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,457
Isn't that what we normally do?

315
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:14,692
It is the same, but, also, more.

316
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:16,394
This is a contest.

317
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:17,562
So keep track of everything you do,

318
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:20,331
and whoever accomplishes
the most by the end of the day

319
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:21,566
gets to scrub in with me on a whipple.

320
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,401
- Me! I want to do that.
- Yes. Yes, please.

321
00:11:23,435 --> 00:11:24,469
- Okay. Go.
- Go.

322
00:11:24,503 --> 00:11:26,070
- Okay.
- Oh, wait. Hold on.

323
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:27,672
Did anyone eat cookies this morning?

324
00:11:27,706 --> 00:11:30,508
A patient brought in cookies
that had rat poison in them.

325
00:11:30,543 --> 00:11:32,343
They were weed cookies,
accidental weed cookies.

326
00:11:32,378 --> 00:11:33,545
They were in a floral tin.
Did anyone eat them?

327
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:34,546
- No.
- No.

328
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,914
- No.
- Nope.

329
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:37,382
- Okay. Get to work.
- Okay. Now go.

330
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,150
Uh, yes.

331
00:11:39,185 --> 00:11:41,519
Okay. Bailey's
paging me a 911 from the OR.

332
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:43,488
I got to go.

333
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:53,231
Dr. Bailey.

334
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:58,703
Grey. I'm feeling dizzy
and light-headed and...

335
00:11:58,737 --> 00:12:00,018
I think something's wrong with her.

336
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,540
I think I know what it is.
Can we page Jo Wilson?

337
00:12:06,111 --> 00:12:08,446
I thought it was my heart.

338
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,615
No, this is your brain on drugs.

339
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:11,925
Wait. All of them?

340
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,219
All of my attendings had a cookie, Grey?

341
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:15,920
No, just a few and you.

342
00:12:15,955 --> 00:12:17,889
Oh, this is bad.

343
00:12:17,923 --> 00:12:20,058
This is very, very bad.

344
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:21,859
I opened that man up.

345
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:23,528
I'm into his peritoneum.

346
00:12:23,562 --> 00:12:25,196
I'm into him.

347
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:28,466
Dr. Bailey, it's okay. I'm here.

348
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,368
I'm going to finish this for you.

349
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:31,655
- Total gastrectomy.
- Mm.

350
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:33,571
I got it. I called Jo Wilson.

351
00:12:33,606 --> 00:12:34,872
- Hey.
- She's gonna come...

352
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:35,939
- Hey.
- She's here.

353
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:37,609
Wilson's here. Why?

354
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:38,810
Dr. Bailey had a cookie.

355
00:12:38,844 --> 00:12:41,446
Oh, crap.

356
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,814
Why are you laughing?

357
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:44,249
This is not funny.

358
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:47,252
This is very not funny. I'm the chief.

359
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:48,453
It's very serious.

360
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:50,455
Will you take the chief
up to the lecture hall, please?

361
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:51,889
Yes. Yes.

362
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:55,159
- I have this, Dr. Bailey, okay?
- Mnh.

363
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:56,661
You'll do a good job?

364
00:12:56,695 --> 00:12:59,328
'Cause he's very sweet,
and his kids are very scared.

365
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,166
Dr. Bailey. I have this.

366
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:03,568
- I love you.
- Oh, my.

367
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:05,003
- Okay, okay.
- Ohh!

368
00:13:05,037 --> 00:13:07,672
What?

369
00:13:07,706 --> 00:13:09,607
- Oops.
- Go, go, go.

370
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:17,531
I don't think they're broken,
but they're too swollen to move.

371
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:19,992
- This is a bad idea.
- It's the only idea.

372
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:21,718
He's already open, and this procedure

373
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:24,087
takes delicate suturing,
which I cannot do.

374
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,423
But I've never done
a gastrectomy by myself before.

375
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:27,824
Yeah, but you've watched a lot.

376
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:28,859
You can do this. I believe in you.

377
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,260
Okay, now you sound stoned.

378
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:32,762
Dr. Grey, patient's BP is dropping a bit.

379
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:34,931
Scrub.

380
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:37,534
- Hey.
- Calvary's here.

381
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:38,502
- Oh.
- Is the baby here yet?

382
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:39,936
Not... Not yet. What...
What's he doing here?

383
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:41,338
The baby's not sick, I hope.

384
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:43,940
A patient accidentally
brought in pot cookies.

385
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:45,275
He's high.

386
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:46,843
So you brought him here?

387
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:47,904
Well, I wanted to get here

388
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:48,945
as fast as possible.

389
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,046
I didn't want you to freak out.

390
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:51,348
Oh, yeah. Bingo.

391
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:53,049
And I couldn't leave him alone in my lab

392
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:54,518
full of very expensive equipment.

393
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:55,919
- Huh.
- Are you okay?

394
00:13:55,953 --> 00:13:57,787
- Did you eat a cookie?
- No, no.

395
00:13:57,822 --> 00:13:59,022
I am waiting for a 6-month-old,

396
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:00,891
and you bring a stoned guy to my house?!

397
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:02,359
We'll just make him hide in the back

398
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:03,360
while the social worker's where.

399
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:04,928
Listen... you go shower.

400
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:05,929
I'm gonna take care
of cleaning the house.

401
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:08,598
Okay, okay. I can't believe
this is happening.

402
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:10,367
It is. It's good.

403
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:15,805
Oh, dude.

404
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,049
You're so screwed right now.

405
00:14:23,522 --> 00:14:24,548
- Hey.
- Hey!

406
00:14:24,582 --> 00:14:25,715
This room is occupied.

407
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,683
- Oops.
- It's okay.

408
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:29,586
- Sorry, hi. I'm sorry.
- Just... It's fine.

409
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:34,941
- What do we do now?
- Huh?

410
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:37,561
Oh, we just have to wait for it to pass.

411
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:40,130
But we can... I mean, we can
hang out and talk, you know?

412
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:42,432
- Just say whatever comes into our heads.
- Mm.

413
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:46,494
Just press "play" and see what comes out.

414
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:50,073
I really want some cheese.

415
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:52,909
I pressed fast-forward
on Carina, I think.

416
00:14:52,944 --> 00:14:55,779
It's... such a good food.

417
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:57,948
There are so many kinds.

418
00:14:57,982 --> 00:14:59,983
I asked her to...
I asked her to stay here

419
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:01,518
instead of going back to Italy.

420
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:03,954
Oh. Cheddar.

421
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:06,456
String cheese.

422
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,657
Brie.

423
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:08,792
The kind with the holes in it. It's...

424
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:10,794
You know, we haven't even really
been dating that long.

425
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:12,145
Swiss!

426
00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:14,631
Oh, I probably freaked her out.

427
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,199
I mean, who... who asks a person

428
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:17,867
to give up their country for them?

429
00:15:17,902 --> 00:15:21,705
Sometimes I just stand
in the cheese section

430
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:23,106
of the grocery store and just...

431
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:29,287
Mozzarella.

432
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:33,316
Gouda. Munster.

433
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:35,051
She'd be a woman without a country.

434
00:15:35,086 --> 00:15:36,987
Dill Havarti.

435
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:39,356
Whoa!

436
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,025
It goes away.

437
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,360
Oh, and then it comes back.

438
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:45,028
Goes away.

439
00:15:45,062 --> 00:15:47,063
- No country.
- Comes back.

440
00:15:47,098 --> 00:15:50,233
It goes away. Comes back.

441
00:16:11,742 --> 00:16:13,498
What happened?

442
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,028
I heard something I think
I should not have heard.

443
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:20,196
Also, I've never done pot before.

444
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:23,099
Oh, neither have I. I listen to Mr. T.

445
00:16:23,134 --> 00:16:24,501
Mr. T said...

446
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:26,369
"Kid, don't do drugs."

447
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:27,437
"Stay in school."

448
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:29,706
"Treat your mama right."

449
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,242
I followed Mr. T to a "T."

450
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:35,103
I dared to stay off drugs.

451
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:37,847
What did you hear?

452
00:16:37,882 --> 00:16:38,915
I don't hear anything.

453
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:40,917
No. What did you hear?

454
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:41,918
About what?

455
00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:43,853
You said you heard something
you shouldn't have.

456
00:16:43,888 --> 00:16:45,288
- What did you hear?
- Oh.

457
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:46,856
Oh, my God!

458
00:16:46,891 --> 00:16:48,858
Oh, it was... it was bad.

459
00:16:48,893 --> 00:16:51,795
It was really end-of-an-era bad.

460
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:53,329
It's the end of an era.

461
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,969
I thought marijuana made people peaceful,

462
00:17:00,004 --> 00:17:02,439
but I don't think I ever hated you more.

463
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:08,878
Okay, I just divided
the gastrocolic ligament,

464
00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:11,915
and now I'm gonna take down
the short gastric arteries,

465
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,050
which I'll ligate with 2-0 silks.

466
00:17:14,085 --> 00:17:15,752
Does that sound good?

467
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:19,289
Okay.

468
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:24,094
- Wait, hang on.
- Hmm.

469
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:26,463
Bailey said a total gastrectomy?

470
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:27,897
- Yes. Why?
- Well, because

471
00:17:27,932 --> 00:17:29,632
the tumor feels smaller
and more localized

472
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,101
than it did on the scans.

473
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,802
Why wouldn't Bailey want
to save more of his stomach?

474
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:33,937
I'm not sure.

475
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,581
She doesn't want the guy
to die of cancer... I know that.

476
00:17:37,508 --> 00:17:39,476
Do you think we can do
a subtotal gastrectomy?

477
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,944
What do you think?

478
00:17:42,313 --> 00:17:44,013
Can I take a look at the pre-op scans?

479
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:45,339
I don't have them.

480
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,684
Can I see the scans?

481
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:49,343
Of course, Doctor.

482
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:53,598
Okay.

483
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,594
There's 13 women.
How did I not know that?

484
00:17:57,628 --> 00:17:59,863
I mean H-How did I... How...

485
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:01,230
Why are you so calm?

486
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:04,447
The cookie might have
something to do with it.

487
00:18:06,904 --> 00:18:07,871
You're messing with me.

488
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:08,905
- No, I'm not.
- Very funny.

489
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:10,440
You're messing with me
because I'm a little high.

490
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:11,775
Or because you're a little high.

491
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:13,643
This is not a joke, Jackson.

492
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,146
This is a secret you let out of the bag.

493
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,881
How could this even be kept
a secret at all?

494
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:20,483
Money, honey. Good God, don't be naive.

495
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:22,652
A fortune was paid
to silence those women.

496
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:25,054
No. I understand that, okay?

497
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,390
I'm saying, "Why?"
Why would anyone protect him?

498
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:29,559
Why didn't anybody try to stop him?
Why didn't you try to stop him?

499
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:31,427
Because that's not how it worked.

500
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,199
And... the hope was, for some, that,

501
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:38,668
if the financial hit to your
grandfather was great enough,

502
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,637
he would stop the behavior.

503
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:43,873
And he did. He did stop.

504
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:46,984
Oh.

505
00:18:49,113 --> 00:18:50,313
You did this.

506
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,318
You covered this up.

507
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:04,260
Oh, Mom.

508
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,165
I'm gonna need child locks and stuff.

509
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,500
Not yet. Not till they're crawling.

510
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:11,501
Babies are easy.

511
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:14,270
You just have to support
their necks like this.

512
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:15,505
You were supposed to stay in the bedroom

513
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:16,873
until after the social worker leaves.

514
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,599
Smells like Owen in there.

515
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,111
Oh, crap. I just crushed chip baby.

516
00:19:22,146 --> 00:19:24,313
Get back there.

517
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:30,787
This chip smells like Owen.

518
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:33,423
- They're here already.
- Okay.

519
00:19:33,457 --> 00:19:35,191
Take a deep breath.
Didn't think it would be a baby.

520
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:36,192
I thought it would be a kid
who I could win over

521
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:38,127
with, you know,
conversation and ice cream,

522
00:19:38,162 --> 00:19:39,362
but a baby?

523
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:40,597
- I just...
- Okay, Owen. Look at me.

524
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:41,831
We're just gonna take a minute.

525
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:44,934
I can't think of anyone who is
more prepared for parenthood...

526
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:46,636
Hi.

527
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,937
Dr. Hunt?

528
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:51,574
I'm Elaine Hodge, DSHS.

529
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:52,942
And this is Leo.

530
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:55,278
No, no. I'm Dr. Hunt. Owen.

531
00:19:55,312 --> 00:19:57,580
And this is my friend, Amelia.

532
00:19:57,615 --> 00:19:59,916
Oh, he's cute. You got a cute one.

533
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,751
Sometimes, they look like an old man.

534
00:20:03,153 --> 00:20:05,221
- Who's this?
- He's just a... you know...

535
00:20:05,256 --> 00:20:06,389
Dr. Alex Karev.

536
00:20:06,423 --> 00:20:09,158
I'm the Chief of, uh, Pediatric
Surgery at Grey-Sloan.

537
00:20:09,193 --> 00:20:11,327
I came by to give the baby
a quick check-up.

538
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:15,164
Make sure he doesn't have
signs of jaundice

539
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:17,934
or RSV or rickets.

540
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,836
That is so nice. Here you go.

541
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,304
- No.
- No, no. I-I got him.

542
00:20:21,338 --> 00:20:22,505
I got him. I got him. I got him.

543
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:24,274
Yeah. Yep, yep, yep.

544
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:25,441
Hey.

545
00:20:29,513 --> 00:20:31,180
Would you like some chips?

546
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:34,784
Engineering to 3 West.
Engineering to 3 West.

547
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,319
Oh, Dr. Qadri.

548
00:20:36,353 --> 00:20:37,754
What happened to the board?

549
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:39,689
Dr. Grey cancelled everything.

550
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:43,159
It looks like she postponed
the contest, too.

551
00:20:43,193 --> 00:20:44,627
- Why?
- I don't know.

552
00:20:44,662 --> 00:20:47,938
Um, there was a situation...

553
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:50,500
with some cookies.

554
00:20:50,534 --> 00:20:52,168
Cook... Cookies?

555
00:20:54,238 --> 00:20:56,339
Yes! I'm here. I'm here first!

556
00:20:56,373 --> 00:20:57,640
Patient's in septic shock.

557
00:20:57,675 --> 00:20:59,275
Systolic's in the 90s and falling,

558
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,376
heart rate 130s.

559
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:01,511
He had a bolus of LR, but...

560
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:03,613
Oh, man. He needs a central line.

561
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:04,814
Then put one in!

562
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,316
I... You do it.

563
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,450
I can't! You're the surgeon.

564
00:21:07,484 --> 00:21:09,886
No, I can't. I'll get someone!

565
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,221
Dr. Roy! I need help in here!

566
00:21:12,256 --> 00:21:13,289
- Watch out.
- Help!

567
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:19,529
Oh. Helm, go. Take him.

568
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:21,030
Parker, help me with Roy.

569
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:22,832
My patient needs a central line!

570
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,867
- I'm on it!
- Casey, get some gloves.

571
00:21:24,902 --> 00:21:26,336
Got it.

572
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,338
Easy, Roy. Easy.

573
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:35,767
I see why Bailey wanted
to remove the whole stomach.

574
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:39,163
The tumor is huge. It looks
like it's in the cardia.

575
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:41,225
I should just follow standard of care,

576
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,284
a total resection, right?

577
00:21:42,318 --> 00:21:43,652
Why do you keep asking me?

578
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:44,653
Because you aren't answering.

579
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:47,289
What are the considerations?

580
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:50,292
Okay, okay, if I do a total gastrectomy,

581
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:52,127
it'll make sure I remove all the cancer,

582
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:53,795
but he'll eat through a feeding tube

583
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,397
for the rest of his life.

584
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:57,899
If I leave part of the stomach,

585
00:21:57,934 --> 00:21:59,835
then he'll have
a way better quality of life

586
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:01,703
unless I leave behind cancer cells,

587
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,207
in which case, he dies
because I kill him.

588
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:08,076
Okay, you know what?
I'm... I'm doing a total.

589
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,245
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm a resident.

590
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,713
I should just follow
the surgery as planned.

591
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,082
You're supposed to do
what's best for the patient.

592
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:16,251
He's not my patient... he's Bailey's,

593
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:17,485
and she handed him off to you, not me,

594
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
so what do I do?

595
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:20,355
Wilson, you're a surgeon.

596
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:23,024
Pull up your big-girl scrubs
and make a call.

597
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:24,860
- There's a life in your hands.
- I know.

598
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:26,261
I just wish there was some way to know

599
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:27,529
that I was removing all of the cancer

600
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:29,749
and not leaving any behind...

601
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,068
The Pen. I need the Pen.

602
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,936
I have one in my lab coat.
It's not sterile.

603
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:37,465
No, no, no.
I need you to find Dr. Webber.

604
00:22:38,307 --> 00:22:39,708
Okay, easy, easy.

605
00:22:39,742 --> 00:22:40,742
Oh, Dr. Webber, I...

606
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,910
Oh, my God! What happened?!

607
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,045
Okay, it was an accident.
We need to get him to trauma.

608
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,180
What do you need, Schmitt?

609
00:22:45,214 --> 00:22:47,215
I'm supposed to ask to borrow
your... your Path Pen.

610
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,783
And Dr. Grey and Dr. Wilson want to know

611
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:50,886
if it can detect gastric adenocarcinoma.

612
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,788
It can, and it's in my office,
but I don't want you to go...

613
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:55,257
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

614
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,759
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

615
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,761
Let's move. Now.

616
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:07,135
Does it feel right with Carina?

617
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:08,169
Boop.

618
00:23:08,204 --> 00:23:09,871
'Cause, you know,
sometimes you can feel scared,

619
00:23:09,906 --> 00:23:11,606
but, then,
you're lying together at night,

620
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,942
and it just feels right.

621
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,377
Yeah.

622
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:17,312
Yeah, it feels right.

623
00:23:17,346 --> 00:23:20,916
Callie is fun and funny,
and the sex is really great.

624
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,217
- Carina.
- Hm? What?

625
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:23,318
You said "Callie."

626
00:23:23,352 --> 00:23:24,753
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

627
00:23:24,787 --> 00:23:25,921
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

628
00:23:25,955 --> 00:23:26,922
You're high!

629
00:23:26,956 --> 00:23:29,350
Yes, I am, but you said it.

630
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:31,927
Press the "rewind" button on your mind.

631
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,563
Oh, my God. I did.

632
00:23:35,598 --> 00:23:37,465
Why did I... Why did I do that?

633
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,934
- Boop.
- They're very different people.

634
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:40,168
They don't laugh alike.
They don't walk alike.

635
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:41,336
They definitely don't talk alike.

636
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,104
- Boop.
- So that's weird.

637
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:45,173
Boop. I like that sound.

638
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:46,942
But both of them definitely know

639
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:48,944
how to make me lose my mind...

640
00:23:48,978 --> 00:23:51,112
- in bed.
- Hey, where's the liver?

641
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:54,182
- Then...
- I lost the liver!

642
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:55,350
...Callie just went away.

643
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:57,352
She took my daughter and
got on a plane, and she left.

644
00:23:57,386 --> 00:23:59,120
What? Um. Have you seen it?

645
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:01,156
It's... It's liver-shaped.

646
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,325
Maybe Eliza Minnick took a plane, too.

647
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,094
I have no idea because she
ghosted me, so there's that.

648
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:08,263
Okay, it's red.

649
00:24:08,297 --> 00:24:09,531
It helped metabolize things,

650
00:24:09,565 --> 00:24:11,933
it eliminated toxins, and now it's gone!

651
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:13,368
Eventually, everyone leaves me.

652
00:24:13,402 --> 00:24:15,103
You know?

653
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:17,105
- They got on...
- I lost the liver.

654
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:19,307
...planes or ghostmobiles or wherever...

655
00:24:19,342 --> 00:24:20,976
they just disappear.

656
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,945
And maybe that's why I held on
so hard to Carina, you know?

657
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,181
Like I was afraid that I was
gonna lose her like I...

658
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,149
like I lose everybody else.

659
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:30,719
Maybe I'm just scared
of repeating the past.

660
00:24:30,753 --> 00:24:32,520
- What if she dies?!
- Whoa.

661
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,289
Because I lost the liver!

662
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:39,160
It's not... It's not good.

663
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:40,729
I'm not surprised.

664
00:24:40,763 --> 00:24:44,299
I met Harper Avery two times,
and he was awful.

665
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,867
Awful man.

666
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,371
He had a beak like an owl
and a very dry mouth.

667
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,540
I have a very dry mouth.
Do you have that?

668
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:57,212
Grey has a Harper Avery.
She is part of a family legacy.

669
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:00,382
Yang was nominated for one.

670
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,776
She was the best in our class.

671
00:25:03,386 --> 00:25:06,321
I always wanted a Harper Avery.

672
00:25:06,355 --> 00:25:08,256
I had a Jackson Avery.

673
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,358
It's not the same thing.

674
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:11,860
I have a secret.

675
00:25:11,894 --> 00:25:13,428
I don't even need this contest,

676
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:17,399
'cause I just signed a contract
with a manufacturer.

677
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,833
Mm. I'm gonna be rich.

678
00:25:18,868 --> 00:25:21,102
They cannot keep a secret.

679
00:25:21,137 --> 00:25:23,338
- I know about Harper.
- Mm.

680
00:25:23,372 --> 00:25:24,439
- And I know about Maggie.
- Mm-hmm.

681
00:25:24,473 --> 00:25:26,441
We're going to make the TrailBlazer.

682
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:30,078
Me and Midnight Pleasures, Inc.

683
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,247
I saw them pull into
the parking lot together.

684
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,582
They live on opposite sides of town.

685
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:37,352
There's only one reason
that they would carpool.

686
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:39,087
My husband said, "You really want to go

687
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,022
into business with a sex-toy company?"

688
00:25:41,057 --> 00:25:44,225
But I have a secret, too.

689
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,647
I've been seeing someone.

690
00:25:45,682 --> 00:25:48,530
I said to him,
"I have a colonoscopy device.

691
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:51,099
It goes into people's rectums.

692
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:55,303
This company already has items
that function similarly.

693
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:57,915
Don't make it nasty."

694
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,292
Wait. What?

695
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,545
You're making
your colonoscopy TrailBlazer

696
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:04,913
with a sex-toy company?

697
00:26:04,947 --> 00:26:07,482
Meredith Grey called it the "TAILBlazer."

698
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:09,451
That's where I got the idea.

699
00:26:23,532 --> 00:26:25,733
Dr. Schmitt? Is it over?

700
00:26:25,768 --> 00:26:27,402
Dr. Bailey said
it wouldn't take this long.

701
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:28,436
Is he okay?

702
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:29,838
He's not out yet.

703
00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:32,173
I had to get some equipment
so we can finish.

704
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,466
Oh, my God. What is that?

705
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,410
Something went wrong, didn't it?

706
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:36,945
Something unexpected?

707
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:39,013
Is my dad gonna die?

708
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:40,748
Please don't let him die, Dr. Schmitt.

709
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:43,451
No. No. There's no complication.

710
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:47,422
And I will do everything I can
to make sure he's all right.

711
00:26:47,456 --> 00:26:49,958
In fact, I'm gonna do that right now.

712
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,299
What was I thinking?

713
00:26:58,334 --> 00:26:59,428
You can tell, right, that I

714
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:00,468
don't know what I'm doing?

715
00:27:00,503 --> 00:27:02,003
"Yes, I hate you already.

716
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,505
You're the worst."

717
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,539
Alex, stop it.

718
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:06,474
"No, you're making me
high-strung and competitive

719
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:07,731
as we speak!"

720
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:09,677
- You are not helping.
- No, no. He's right.

721
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,679
They say all those kids tend
to have type-A personalities

722
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,215
'cause their parents are so stressed

723
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,550
about every little thing,

724
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,784
and then, second baby comes along

725
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:18,520
and they're more comfortable,

726
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,188
so that kid gets to be more easygoing.

727
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,056
You just explained so much.

728
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,659
Yeah, I always thought Megan
was lucky that way.

729
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:26,461
I was thinking about me being
the youngest of five.

730
00:27:26,495 --> 00:27:27,906
"Am I getting a little sister?

731
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:29,364
When's she coming?"

732
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,883
Alex.

733
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:33,835
Wait. This isn't the way to the store.

734
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:36,704
Nope. This group is not ready
to be seen in public,

735
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,473
but I know where to get
everything you need

736
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:40,375
because my sister-in-law is a pack rat.

737
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,677
"Daddy, can I have a pony?"

738
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:46,181
Shh, shh.

739
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:51,653
It really works?

740
00:27:51,687 --> 00:27:54,556
Well, it's supposed to.
It's still in the testing stage.

741
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,925
We're testing it? On this guy?

742
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,726
He... He's got a wife and two kids.

743
00:27:58,761 --> 00:27:59,727
They're very nice,

744
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:02,030
and they really, really
want him to stay alive.

745
00:28:02,064 --> 00:28:03,498
And I promised them I'd make sure he gets

746
00:28:03,532 --> 00:28:05,400
the best possible care.

747
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:06,267
So, maybe, Dr. Grey,

748
00:28:06,302 --> 00:28:07,035
if you could just tell Dr. Wilson...

749
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,404
Schmitt, be quiet. She's got it.

750
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,106
Hey, look. The distal end...

751
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,348
Adenocarcinoma.

752
00:28:14,383 --> 00:28:15,453
- But if I go

753
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:18,079
one centimeter proximally...

754
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,215
It works.

755
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:21,583
It's working.

756
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,251
Oh, my God.

757
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:27,021
I'm gonna save half his stomach.

758
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,458
Linear stapler.

759
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:44,105
Time of death... 16:06.

760
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,241
Acute liver...

761
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:48,127
...disappearance.

762
00:28:49,011 --> 00:28:52,005
We did everything we could,
but we could not save her.

763
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:55,617
Our thoughts and prayers are with her,

764
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,887
her family, and her friends.

765
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:23,862
Good. Now you'll want
to ligate the branch.

766
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,021
Why are you letting them do this?

767
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,523
Because they need to practice.

768
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,831
Does it have to be on me?

769
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:30,626
Roy, I'm gonna give you a light sedation.

770
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,227
Thank you.

771
00:29:32,262 --> 00:29:33,422
Mm.

772
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:38,200
Wait. Wait.

773
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,235
Is that diazepam?

774
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,805
Does that interact with... other drugs?

775
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,577
Okay, we fed you. We changed you.

776
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:50,078
Everything's okay.

777
00:29:50,113 --> 00:29:52,714
This is a very, very, very long scarf.

778
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,142
That's a Moby.

779
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:56,485
You wrap it around yourself and
the baby so you can carry him.

780
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,920
Okay, calm down. Calm down, Leo.

781
00:29:57,954 --> 00:30:00,255
It's okay. It's okay.

782
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,323
Do you want a diaper genie?

783
00:30:01,357 --> 00:30:03,425
Does he come to the house?

784
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,660
Uh, I guess so.

785
00:30:04,694 --> 00:30:05,994
How do you know what all this stuff is?

786
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:07,396
You'll figure it out.

787
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,731
Okay, I got you.
I got you. Shh, shh, shh.

788
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,935
Amelia?

789
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:14,146
Was this a bad idea?

790
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:16,772
What? No. You've wanted this forever.

791
00:30:16,806 --> 00:30:18,974
Yeah, I know what I wanted,
but what about him?

792
00:30:19,008 --> 00:30:21,577
You know, who's to say
I was supposed to be a father?

793
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,252
Maybe this was all going
how it was supposed to,

794
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:24,350
and I just forced it.

795
00:30:24,385 --> 00:30:25,948
Owen, what you're doing is beautiful.

796
00:30:25,982 --> 00:30:27,082
You're fostering him.

797
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,517
You're... You're being there for him

798
00:30:28,551 --> 00:30:29,644
when nobody else is.

799
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,653
- Ha!
- My foster parents sucked.

800
00:30:31,688 --> 00:30:33,121
- Alex!
- No, for real.

801
00:30:33,156 --> 00:30:35,424
They just stuck me in a room
with some other kids

802
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,593
and then collected a check.

803
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,628
Except for one. There was one guy.

804
00:30:39,662 --> 00:30:41,663
He worked nights in a warehouse.

805
00:30:41,698 --> 00:30:43,665
Come home, dead tired
at the crack of dawn,

806
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,601
and go straight to bed.

807
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,270
But then, an hour later, he'd wake up,

808
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,671
just so he could eat cereal with me

809
00:30:49,706 --> 00:30:53,108
and tell me, you know, "Have a good day,"

810
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,209
before I went to school.

811
00:30:54,244 --> 00:30:56,211
Then he'd go back to sleep.

812
00:30:56,246 --> 00:31:01,717
Wasn't much, but, you know,
he just gave a crap, you know?

813
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:05,287
He gave a crap, and you, my friend,

814
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,689
you are giving so many craps right now.

815
00:31:07,724 --> 00:31:10,158
This man's got it made.

816
00:31:10,193 --> 00:31:11,727
He's not crying.

817
00:31:11,761 --> 00:31:13,862
Look. I did it.

818
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:16,732
Mnh. Maybe not.

819
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,071
It was a very different time then.

820
00:31:23,106 --> 00:31:24,907
It was his name. It was his foundation.

821
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:26,041
He made the rules.

822
00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:27,576
Oh, please stop talking, Mom.

823
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,044
I'm just trying to help you understand.

824
00:31:29,078 --> 00:31:30,812
Well, I wish you would help those women.

825
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,080
Look at me.

826
00:31:32,115 --> 00:31:34,182
You told me to step up.

827
00:31:34,217 --> 00:31:36,518
You wanted to buy this hospital,
I wanted nothing to do with it,

828
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:38,520
and you said, "Step up. Take the lead.

829
00:31:38,555 --> 00:31:39,788
Take part in what
this family has built," right?

830
00:31:39,822 --> 00:31:40,810
And you did.

831
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:42,142
You didn't tell me what
the hell it was built on.

832
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:44,059
No, no. You do not get to do that.

833
00:31:44,093 --> 00:31:47,325
You do not get to stand there
in judgment of me.

834
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,364
That
- 30 years ago, getting harassed at work,

835
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:52,100
getting groped at work wasn't
something we could protest.

836
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:54,570
It was something we had to take
with our morning coffee.

837
00:31:54,604 --> 00:31:56,104
It was part of the job.

838
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:58,180
And if we made a noise, if we fussed,

839
00:31:58,214 --> 00:32:00,375
we were told we were overreacting

840
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,010
and, more often than not, we lost the job

841
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,846
and our reputation along with it.

842
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,616
I was not then who I am now.

843
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,752
I didn't have the voice then
that I have now.

844
00:32:10,787 --> 00:32:12,011
I had choices.

845
00:32:12,045 --> 00:32:13,689
I could stand there
and let your grandfather

846
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,458
fire those women
and drag them through the mud,

847
00:32:16,492 --> 00:32:20,596
or I could make sure they got some money,

848
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,433
a leg to stand on,
a path to move forward on.

849
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:29,097
I'm not ashamed of myself, Jackson,

850
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,709
but I am ashamed
of what your grandfather did.

851
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,277
And I'm so sorry that now

852
00:32:35,311 --> 00:32:38,714
you have to carry that burden
along with me.

853
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:42,150
And I'm sorry that that burden
might just bring this family,

854
00:32:42,185 --> 00:32:44,087
this entire hospital,

855
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:47,289
and all of his hospitals down.

856
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:53,629
Okay. That's it.

857
00:32:53,663 --> 00:32:54,663
Now what?

858
00:32:54,697 --> 00:32:55,831
Well, now we cross our fingers

859
00:32:55,865 --> 00:32:57,633
and pray we made the right decision.

860
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,128
You did.

861
00:33:00,703 --> 00:33:04,339
You did exactly what I would
have done, except for The Pen.

862
00:33:04,374 --> 00:33:06,426
I wouldn't have needed that.

863
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,645
You could have saved me a lot
of stress if you told me sooner.

864
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,013
Well, that's not how you learn.

865
00:33:11,047 --> 00:33:12,681
I'm pretty sure
having an experienced surgeon

866
00:33:12,715 --> 00:33:15,083
tell you what to do
is exactly how you learn.

867
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,852
You know exactly what to do.

868
00:33:16,886 --> 00:33:18,687
You're a highly competent surgeon.

869
00:33:18,721 --> 00:33:21,089
You've memorized
and practiced every move,

870
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,525
but making tough choices
under immense pressure...

871
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:26,328
that's how you become
a truly great surgeon.

872
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,099
And now you get
to go tell his family that,

873
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,035
not only did you save his life,

874
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:35,170
you saved his quality of life.

875
00:33:36,873 --> 00:33:38,940
I'm gonna go check on our stoners.

876
00:33:40,576 --> 00:33:43,045
Nice work.

877
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:00,962
What's happening?

878
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,798
We're having a funeral.

879
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,566
Whose?

880
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,301
Mm, Harper Avery.

881
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,870
The Harper Averies. The end of an era.

882
00:34:11,908 --> 00:34:13,675
What are you talking about?

883
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,755
You were put into
a terrible position, Mom,

884
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:28,590
and I doubted you.

885
00:34:28,624 --> 00:34:30,392
I forgot who you were
for a moment. I'm sorry.

886
00:34:30,426 --> 00:34:31,927
It's all right, baby.

887
00:34:31,961 --> 00:34:33,595
I don't know what's gonna happen next,

888
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:35,063
but it's not gonna be good.

889
00:34:35,098 --> 00:34:36,231
Well, we just got to tell the truth

890
00:34:36,265 --> 00:34:37,365
and get out ahead of this thing.

891
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,836
We'll get in touch with those
women and make this right.

892
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,271
Yeah. Yeah.

893
00:34:43,306 --> 00:34:45,373
Tell me it isn't true.

894
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:51,379
I've spent my whole life
working for that award.

895
00:34:51,414 --> 00:34:53,348
What did Harper Avery do?

896
00:34:56,252 --> 00:34:59,247
Well, I guess we might as well start now.

897
00:35:00,323 --> 00:35:01,590
Mm-hmm.

898
00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:03,959
We're gonna start with you, Meredith.

899
00:35:11,884 --> 00:35:13,785
So, was my mother one of these women?

900
00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:16,187
No. No, your mother
was not one of the women.

901
00:35:16,222 --> 00:35:18,089
So, these women...
they were offered money

902
00:35:18,123 --> 00:35:19,691
in exchange for what exactly?

903
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:21,993
In exchange for silence and an agreement

904
00:35:22,027 --> 00:35:24,095
that they would never
work at a Harper Avery hospital

905
00:35:24,129 --> 00:35:26,431
or enter the Harper Avery Awards.

906
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:29,033
I mean, my mother spent her career

907
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:31,502
trying to win Harper Avery Awards.

908
00:35:31,537 --> 00:35:33,371
She lost her best friend over it.

909
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:36,535
His initials take up
half the space in her journals.

910
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,246
Oh, my God.

911
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:43,147
Does the name Marie Cerone
mean anything to you?

912
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:46,184
Yes. She was one of the women.

913
00:35:46,218 --> 00:35:49,187
So my mother had to take
her name off of the paper

914
00:35:49,221 --> 00:35:52,490
or she would never be able
to win a Harper Avery.

915
00:35:56,428 --> 00:35:58,223
Son of a bitch.

916
00:35:58,931 --> 00:36:01,032
Will I be able to do surgery again?

917
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:04,969
No. Your tox screen came back positive.

918
00:36:05,004 --> 00:36:06,982
This morning, you were asked
if you had eaten a cookie,

919
00:36:07,016 --> 00:36:08,106
and you said, "No."

920
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,874
Half the attendings ate those cookies!

921
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:11,242
And acted responsibly.

922
00:36:11,277 --> 00:36:13,244
You lied so you could get
another surgery.

923
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:14,913
You put patients at risk.

924
00:36:14,947 --> 00:36:17,181
So... I-I'm suspended?

925
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,983
No.

926
00:36:19,018 --> 00:36:20,919
You're fired.

927
00:36:22,621 --> 00:36:24,268
Surgeons can benefit

928
00:36:24,302 --> 00:36:27,191
from altered states of consciousness...

929
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,426
...but only when
- they're achieved naturally.

930
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,094
The women allege that Dr. Harper Avery

931
00:36:30,129 --> 00:36:31,829
made unwanted advances

932
00:36:31,864 --> 00:36:34,165
and then barred them
from working at any hospital

933
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:36,501
that received funding
from his foundation,

934
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:39,203
effectively crippling
their medical careers.

935
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:42,173
Today, they say they're
finished being silenced.

936
00:36:42,207 --> 00:36:44,008
The lows drive us to do better.

937
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:46,878
Well, we're not out ahead of it.

938
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:57,021
Hey.

939
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:58,923
I heard about the cookies.

940
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:00,792
Do you need a ride home?

941
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:01,953
You're still here.

942
00:37:01,988 --> 00:37:04,896
Of course. I wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

943
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,132
The highs of saving a life are
the reward for a job well done.

944
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,780
Here's his jacket and bag,

945
00:37:22,815 --> 00:37:25,216
and I packed him snacks for the road.

946
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,951
- Thanks.
- You look happy.

947
00:37:26,986 --> 00:37:28,312
I had a really, really good day.

948
00:37:33,192 --> 00:37:36,227
And then there are times when
our state of mind is altered,

949
00:37:36,261 --> 00:37:39,831
and it has nothing to do
with brain chemistry.

950
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:43,167
- He's finally down?
- Yeah.

951
00:37:43,202 --> 00:37:45,670
I think I was down to 35 bottles
of beer on the wall.

952
00:37:45,704 --> 00:37:47,238
I heard.

953
00:37:47,272 --> 00:37:49,974
Ohh. I've had him less than 24 hours,

954
00:37:50,009 --> 00:37:52,176
and I expose him to drugs
and heavy drinking.

955
00:37:52,211 --> 00:37:54,278
I'm corrupting a baby.

956
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,947
You still worried about screwing him up?

957
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:57,515
No, I moved on to worrying

958
00:37:57,549 --> 00:38:00,435
about SIDS and... rickets, yeah.

959
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:01,497
Well, you're supposed

960
00:38:01,522 --> 00:38:02,687
to worry about that.

961
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:04,989
If you weren't worried
about that, I would be worried.

962
00:38:05,024 --> 00:38:06,157
Mm-hmm.

963
00:38:06,191 --> 00:38:07,525
- You're gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

964
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:09,092
You should go get some sleep
while he sleeps.

965
00:38:09,126 --> 00:38:11,262
- Mm. I'm just gonna sleep here.
- Mm.

966
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,967
Mm.

967
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:18,002
Okay. Thank you for coming.

968
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:20,371
Okay.

969
00:38:33,052 --> 00:38:34,986
What are you...? You staying?

970
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,988
Yeah, I figure for one night.

971
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:39,657
Thank God. I mean, uh, thank you.

972
00:38:39,691 --> 00:38:42,193
She's staying. Yeah.

973
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:45,196
- Ooh. Hey.
- Hi, baby.

974
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,337
Why are you wide awake?

975
00:38:46,362 --> 00:38:48,166
- Why are you still awake?
- Yes. Yeah.

976
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,233
It's time for sleep, little Leo.

977
00:38:49,268 --> 00:38:51,335
There you go. There you go.

978
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:55,239
New opportunities open us up
to greater possibilities.

979
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:09,353
All right. Come on.

980
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:12,256
Harper Avery. I can't believe it.

981
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:13,691
I know.

982
00:39:13,725 --> 00:39:14,859
Did Jackson know?

983
00:39:14,893 --> 00:39:16,060
Not until today.

984
00:39:18,297 --> 00:39:19,530
What are you gonna do?

985
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,598
I don't know.

986
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,244
New information and a new perspective

987
00:39:33,278 --> 00:39:36,914
can permanently shift our consciousness.

988
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:40,418
And the way we see the world
will never be the same.

989
00:39:43,312 --> 00:39:51,320

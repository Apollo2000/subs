1
00:00:03,598 --> 00:00:05,999
Backaches, jaw pain, nausea.

2
00:00:06,034 --> 00:00:07,301
Hey. Did you eat?

3
00:00:07,335 --> 00:00:08,435
Amelia got dinner.

4
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:09,403
It's nothing special.

5
00:00:09,437 --> 00:00:11,571
Just a little pasta
from our regular place.

6
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:12,572
Sit down. I'll grab you a plate.

7
00:00:12,607 --> 00:00:14,141
I got it.

8
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,110
In men, these things

9
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:19,413
are probably exactly
what they seem like.

10
00:00:19,447 --> 00:00:20,647
Amelia's back.

11
00:00:20,682 --> 00:00:21,448
What's that supposed to mean?

12
00:00:21,482 --> 00:00:23,650
You leave all the doors open...

13
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:24,818
everywhere, all the time.

14
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:26,620
- What?
- Hey, uh, try the artichoke.

15
00:00:26,654 --> 00:00:28,989
Bathroom doors, cabinets, everything...

16
00:00:29,023 --> 00:00:30,624
open, all the time.

17
00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:33,360
But in women, they're all
symptoms of a heart attack.

18
00:00:33,394 --> 00:00:34,594
Hey, Mer, do you want some wine?

19
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:36,330
Unless that's not... Is that...

20
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:37,364
- It's fine.
- Okay.

21
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:39,466
- You invited me back.
- It's fine.

22
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,335
Just close a thing once in a while.

23
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:42,936
Mer, if you've changed
your mind, say the word.

24
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,339
- I can go.
- No! It's fine.

25
00:00:45,373 --> 00:00:46,406
Sometimes the symptom

26
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:48,809
is actually hiding what's
going on underneath.

27
00:00:48,843 --> 00:00:50,811
So, which resident are
you guys nominating

28
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:52,646
for the Preminger Research Grant?

29
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,947
- I'm gonna go to bed.
- Me too.

30
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:55,215
We were just sitting down together.

31
00:00:55,249 --> 00:00:56,616
- Tired.
- Early morning.

32
00:00:56,651 --> 00:00:59,307
It's all in the way it presents itself.

33
00:00:59,424 --> 00:01:02,859
"The winner of the grant is
awarded one full research year

34
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:05,095
in residence at the
Preminger Research Center.

35
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,564
Each attending will
nominate one candidate

36
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,534
and submit them to the Chief of Surgery,

37
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:13,604
who will then review and
make a decision based on..."

38
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:15,272
Oh.

39
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:17,341
I didn't know I was eligible to apply.

40
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,610
Yeah. It's open to any
resident, any year.

41
00:01:19,644 --> 00:01:20,944
- You gonna apply?
- No.

42
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:23,547
I just got to Grey-Sloan.

43
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:24,915
I can barely find the bathrooms.

44
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:25,716
- "Is resourceful."
- Okay.

45
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,384
Do you think that I should write

46
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:30,254
that I'm "resourceful" or "inventive"?

47
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:31,255
Mm, put that you're both.

48
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,557
Put that you're annoying
when you think out loud.

49
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:35,592
Why are these spaces so small?

50
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:37,628
These spaces cannot
contain how awesome I am.

51
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,396
Okay.

52
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,231
Yes, this is gold.

53
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,133
See? I just won this thing.

54
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:44,901
You don't even need an
awesome application.

55
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:45,869
You have Shepherd in your corner.

56
00:01:45,903 --> 00:01:48,472
Oh, I did, until you
took over her service.

57
00:01:48,506 --> 00:01:49,973
- I didn't do it!
- Sure.

58
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:51,275
Webber's scramble did it.

59
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:54,478
Well, when you apply next year,
Shepherd will have your back.

60
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:56,613
And Grey. And Torres.

61
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:58,081
- You'll be set.
- Hmm.

62
00:01:58,116 --> 00:01:59,383
Remember when they all hated you?

63
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:00,484
Vividly.

64
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:02,073
- Okay, I'm done.
- Me too.

65
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,593
Press "submit" on three?

66
00:02:03,628 --> 00:02:05,930
1...2... 3.

67
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:07,465
I did not meddle!

68
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:09,300
You meddled. You are a meddler!

69
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:10,968
He is the father of that baby!

70
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:13,370
Suing his ex-wife for fraud
is no way to be a father.

71
00:02:13,405 --> 00:02:14,305
That hussy wouldn't be an ex-wife

72
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:16,273
if she hadn't signed
those divorce papers

73
00:02:16,308 --> 00:02:17,475
without disclosing her pregnancy.

74
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:18,342
"Hussy"?!

75
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:19,944
This is April Kepner
we're talking about!

76
00:02:19,978 --> 00:02:22,413
And this is my grandchild
that we're talking about

77
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:23,481
that I won't get to see

78
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:25,282
unless Jackson overturns that divorce

79
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:27,418
and gets his parental rights back!

80
00:02:27,452 --> 00:02:28,319
Meddler.

81
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:30,387
You better stop saying that!

82
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:31,655
Hey, I'll say what I want!

83
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,492
I am trying to help my son.

84
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:36,393
And you are a meddler, a busybody,

85
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:39,463
a helicopter mama, a nosy
Nellie, a buttinsky!

86
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:41,999
- That is trash talk!
- All up in the bug juice.

87
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:43,334
You don't know the flavor, woman.

88
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:44,902
We said - no trash talk in the bedroom.

89
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:47,104
We said no work talk in the bedroom.

90
00:02:51,276 --> 00:02:53,611
Just for the record, I am right.

91
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:55,446
You are wrong.

92
00:02:57,048 --> 00:02:58,115
Meddler.

93
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:03,787
I still think - I should
wait until next year

94
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:04,788
to apply for the grant.

95
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:06,490
Why? You're eligible now.

96
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:08,359
Technically, but they
always give the grant

97
00:03:08,393 --> 00:03:10,161
to a senior resident anyway.

98
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:11,862
Except for when they don't.

99
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:13,531
So you think I should try?

100
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:16,667
Look, if this is what you
want, then sure... apply.

101
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:17,968
It's just...

102
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:20,504
I'm finally getting settled in here.

103
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:21,972
I have friends.

104
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:23,174
I just...

105
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,275
met Sofia.

106
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:27,478
I don't want to run across
the country for a year.

107
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:28,612
I can wait.

108
00:03:28,647 --> 00:03:30,981
I want to be here.

109
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:35,119
Well, I can accept that.

110
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,890
So, you are 14.

111
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:40,791
Um...

112
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:42,526
Are your parents here? Who brought you?

113
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:43,794
I took the bus.

114
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:46,063
Is this gonna take long?

115
00:03:46,097 --> 00:03:48,132
I have to get back for my history test.

116
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,568
Um, well, I mean, it just
kind of sounds like a cold.

117
00:03:50,602 --> 00:03:53,971
I-I know, but it's just

118
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:57,474
M-My stomach just hurts when I cough...

119
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:59,376
or sneeze...

120
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,511
or move sometimes.

121
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:02,379
Okay.

122
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:03,414
Let's take a look.

123
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:06,417
Can you lean back?

124
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:08,519
Can you lift up your shirt for me?

125
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:11,522
Also...

126
00:04:11,556 --> 00:04:13,390
I-I'm pregnant.

127
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:16,860
Okay, you buried the lead there.

128
00:04:16,895 --> 00:04:20,231
- Um, page O.B.
- Okay.

129
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:21,732
- I don't understand.
- You haven't called back any

130
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:23,601
of the family law
attorneys I recommended.

131
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:25,502
Ma, I really got to prep
this nasal reconstruction.

132
00:04:25,537 --> 00:04:26,937
Oh, well. We have choices.

133
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:28,138
Money is no object.

134
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:30,574
My baby needs a lawyer, and
I'm gonna get you the best.

135
00:04:30,609 --> 00:04:32,343
Oh, I'm done having this conversation.

136
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:33,611
Reynolds is hard to get a sit-down with,

137
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:35,679
but you're an Avery, and that
ought to get us a phone call.

138
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:37,214
I'm not sure I want to Avery this yet.

139
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:40,050
Oh, yes, you do you want to Avery this.
- Mother!

140
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:43,020
April has the power... all the power.

141
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:45,923
You better get some power.

142
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,561
So, there's an organ
procurement at Overbrook?

143
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:52,429
Yes, heart and liver. Patient
is getting critical.

144
00:04:52,464 --> 00:04:55,299
I am so glad... not about the
patient, about the procurement.

145
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,402
It is the perfect excuse to
ditch Bailey's budget meeting.

146
00:04:58,436 --> 00:04:59,570
I want to ditch Bailey's budget meeting.

147
00:04:59,604 --> 00:05:00,804
I think we got it covered.

148
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,273
Oh, come on, Owen.
It's a budget meeting.

149
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:04,475
Okay, fine. I'll meet you
in the ambulance bay in 10.

150
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:07,311
DeLuca's getting the coolers.

151
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:09,980
We're... W-What are you doing?

152
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,882
DeLuca's coming?

153
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:15,819
Sorry.

154
00:05:15,854 --> 00:05:17,121
Finish up a consult.

155
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:18,255
What are you doing here?

156
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,457
Pierce asked me to cover a
heart recovery with Grey.

157
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:22,593
It's my heart recovery, and
you're making us late.

158
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:23,727
Well, I got here as soon as I could.

159
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:25,596
- What happened to Pierce?
- Said she had a budget meeting.

160
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,097
She didn't want to ride with DeLuca.

161
00:05:27,132 --> 00:05:27,931
Then why isn't DeLuca here?

162
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:30,501
- Why am I here?
- All right.

163
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:32,236
We're good. Let's move.

164
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:38,642
- How long have you been feeling pain?
- Since like 6 a.m..

165
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:39,910
Who's your doctor?

166
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:41,812
You?

167
00:05:43,982 --> 00:05:46,083
Have you been getting any
prenatal care at all?

168
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:54,658
Oh, my God!

169
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:55,559
That's my mom!

170
00:05:55,593 --> 00:05:57,594
What is she doing here? You called her?!

171
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:59,163
- No. No, I didn't, but...
- She can't know.

172
00:05:59,197 --> 00:06:00,864
- What?
- She doesn't know I'm pregnant.

173
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:03,200
- You can't tell her. Please!
- I won't.

174
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:06,103
- Promise.
- Yes, I-I-I promise.

176
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:25,729
Jenny, um, I can help
you talk to your mom.

177
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:27,864
No, y-you can't. She'll freak.

178
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:30,667
You're six months pregnant.
She's gonna find out soon.

179
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,435
Why not tell her so
that she can help you?

180
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,204
Because this is not what we do.

181
00:06:34,238 --> 00:06:36,873
That's what she says any time
I forget to do the dishes

182
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,108
or get a "B."

183
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:40,577
"This is not what we do, Jenny."

184
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:43,113
I'm not supposed to
even have a boyfriend,

185
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:45,882
so this would

186
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:47,517
Ow.

187
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:49,119
Dr. Kepner, this is...

188
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:50,353
Jennifer?

189
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:52,055
What are you doing here?

190
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:53,256
Did you track my phone again?

191
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,925
Yes, I tracked your phone again.

192
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,726
Mom, that is so invasive.

193
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:58,762
I pay for the phone. I
get to know where it is.

194
00:06:58,796 --> 00:06:59,596
Same goes for you.

195
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,198
It's the middle of the school day!

196
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:02,799
Why are you even tracking me right now?

197
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:04,868
Well, you're not in school, are you?

198
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:07,771
This is not what we do, Jenny.

199
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:10,106
Hi. Jenny? I'm Dr. Robbins.

200
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:11,575
Um, I hear that you're
having a little...

201
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:12,576
A little abdominal pain.

202
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,545
Um, and Dr. Robbins is
an abdominal doctor,

203
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,680
so, um...

204
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:19,049
we're gonna take Jenny up to C.T.
to get a closer look,

205
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,784
and we'll let you know as
soon as we get the results,

206
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:21,985
all right?

207
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,488
Hey, hey, guess who's joining you

208
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:27,257
on Shepherd's DBS implantation.

209
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,491
Uh, can you get me up to speed?

210
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:29,893
Getting a little face
time in with Shepherd

211
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:30,961
before the meeting tonight?

212
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:32,796
I am the wind beneath her wings,

213
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,831
and I just need to be
sure she remembers that.

214
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:36,099
- Well, I've got your back.
- Ladies.

215
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:38,268
Let's go.

216
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:39,336
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

217
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,470
Let me lead.

218
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:53,183
That's very nice.

219
00:07:53,217 --> 00:07:54,985
Oh.

220
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,954
No, don't clap for that. That was...
That was garbage.

221
00:07:57,989 --> 00:08:01,424
Uh, Dr. Blake and Dr.
Shepherd and, uh...

222
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,026
And who is this?

223
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,494
Haven't seen your face before.

224
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:05,662
It's a nice face.

225
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:07,631
This is Dr. Edwards.

226
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:08,698
God.

227
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:11,001
Why are all the doctors
in this hospital so hot?

228
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:12,202
Well, that's... Seriously.

229
00:08:12,236 --> 00:08:14,004
It's like a... It's like a
condition of employment here.

230
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:15,005
Let's talk about your brain.

231
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,373
Edwards, business time.

232
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:18,108
Kyle Diaz, 34.

233
00:08:18,142 --> 00:08:19,776
Diagnosed two years ago

234
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,778
with relapsing and remitting
multiple sclerosis.

235
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:23,213
Increased symptoms recently.

236
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:24,381
How come you know so much about me

237
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:25,548
and I haven't even met you yet?

238
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,885
Symptoms include persistent
tremor in the right hand.

239
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,886
Yeah, this damn thing

240
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:32,989
showed up right as I was
landing a 13-city tour.

241
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:35,558
Uh, only time I had bad timing.

242
00:08:35,593 --> 00:08:37,227
I prayed for a long time for this break.

243
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:39,029
- I mean, this is...
- This is big.

244
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:41,031
Yeah, it's huge for me. I
mean, I'm the opening act.

245
00:08:41,065 --> 00:08:44,000
The audience won't be there
to see me, but

246
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:45,902
But I swear they'll
leave knowing my name.

247
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:48,638
And I have to kick ass, but I can't.

248
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:51,374
Not with this... wobbly hand.

249
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:53,910
Well, deep brain stimulation
has been proven

250
00:08:53,945 --> 00:08:55,879
to help alleviate intractable
tremors like yours.

251
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:58,415
So, when I wake up, maybe I can
show you how I really play.

252
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:02,218
The... plan

253
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:04,754
is to actually keep you
conscious while we operate,

254
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:07,357
using M.R.I. images to target
the general area of concern.

255
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:10,060
- Hmm.
- Blake?

256
00:09:10,094 --> 00:09:14,030
No, I figured we'd be using
intraoperative micro-recordings

257
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:15,298
to precisely locate the nucleus.

258
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,768
Exactly, and how will we know
when the procedure is working?

259
00:09:18,803 --> 00:09:22,339
Having our patient perform
delicate motor skills

260
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:24,074
while we introduce the electrodes.

261
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:25,909
In Kyle's case, he will play the guitar.

262
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:28,011
Wait. So, I'm

263
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:29,879
I'm gonna play the guitar

264
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:33,049
while you are poking around in my brain?

265
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:35,018
That way, we can know exactly
when we've nailed the tremor.

266
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:37,187
Well, that's impossible.

267
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:38,421
No, it's possible.

268
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:39,789
You'll be awake and able to play.

269
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:40,790
No, for you.

270
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:42,258
I mean, I don't know if
you know what happens

271
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:43,226
when... when women hear me play.

272
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,795
Your hand is gonna get a little shaky.

273
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,297
Well, I'll push through it.

274
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:49,933
And Blake and I will be
performing the operation.

275
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:51,067
Edwards, I need you with Kyle.

276
00:09:51,102 --> 00:09:53,470
I'll be... Blake's assisting?

277
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:55,138
I need you to monitor the tremor,

278
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:56,439
let us know when we got it.

279
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,643
Well...

280
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:02,345
it's gonna be one hell of a first date.

281
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:22,232
Her mother really doesn't know?

282
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:23,366
Nope.

283
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:26,436
That's got top be a lot of
work, hiding it for this long.

284
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,071
Yeah. It is.

285
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,173
It's a hard thing to keep under wraps.

286
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:38,281
Aren't we sort of obligated to
tell the mother she's pregnant?

287
00:10:38,315 --> 00:10:39,649
I mean, if the kid's in danger...

288
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:41,751
Mm, legally we're obligated not to,

289
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:42,786
unless the patient gives us permission.

290
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,187
If it were my kid, I'd
want us to break that law.

291
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:45,655
Oh, Warren.

292
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:47,023
What do you see here?

293
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:48,425
Blood in the lesser sac.

294
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:50,427
Is that an aneurysm?

295
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:52,262
Yeah. Splenic artery aneurysm.

296
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:53,430
What are the risks?

297
00:10:53,464 --> 00:10:55,999
If it bursts, it could cause
an instant massive hemorrhage.

298
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,667
The patient and the baby
both could bleed to death.

299
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:59,869
Now can we tell the mother?

300
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:01,938
- No.
- Yes.

301
00:11:05,242 --> 00:11:06,476
Hmm.

302
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,445
Is that your name up there?

303
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:10,368
Seems that way.

304
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:13,507
Bowel resection with Dr. Webber.

305
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,176
They say he's good.

306
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,777
Easy on the eyes, too.

307
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:18,712
Some men would send flowers.

308
00:11:18,747 --> 00:11:21,448
Nasty-ass necrotic bowel is nice, too.

309
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:23,884
- Mm-hmm.
- Complicated procedure.

310
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,086
Gives us time to talk.

311
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:29,056
And since we are at work...

312
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,725
no subject is off limits.

313
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:35,796
I'll see you in the scrub room, Dr.
Avery.

314
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:37,298
You can yammer on all you want.

315
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:39,934
Doesn't mean I have to listen.

316
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:53,614
So, who do you like for
this Preminger thing?

317
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:55,916
You know, who I don't
work with is Edwards,

318
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:57,418
but Cristina really liked her.

319
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:59,320
Amelia loves her. Why aren't we moving?

320
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:01,922
- Bridge traffic.
- Amelia moved back in, you know?

321
00:12:01,957 --> 00:12:02,957
- Did you know that?
- No.

322
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:04,425
She was asking about you.

323
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:06,093
Yeah, well, you can tell her
that I'm not an alcoholic

324
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:07,161
if that's what she's worried about.

325
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:08,395
I don't think that's what
she was worried about.

326
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,598
I think she's one. That's
what she's worried about.

327
00:12:12,968 --> 00:12:14,802
Shepherd?

328
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:15,936
Shepherd drinks.

329
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:17,338
I bought her one once.

330
00:12:17,372 --> 00:12:18,339
When?

331
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:20,007
Months ago.

332
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:20,975
I didn't know.

333
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,910
- You did that.
- What?

334
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:24,745
- You did that to her?!
- I did what? I didn't know.

335
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:25,679
I-I asked her. She said yes.

336
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:26,847
She didn't tell me she was an alcoholic.

337
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:28,015
- You did it!
- Hold on! Wait!

338
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,450
We have a job to do.

339
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:31,485
The two of you can
kill each other later.

340
00:12:34,856 --> 00:12:37,658
A bubble in my artery?

341
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:39,526
- Did I hurt the baby?
- No, no.

342
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:41,795
It's so big that even a sneeze
could have made it bleed.

343
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,931
Yeah, and the good news is
that the bleeding has stopped,

344
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:47,668
but the splenic aneurysm
could burst at any moment.

345
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:49,837
Yeah, which would be very dangerous

346
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:51,338
for you and for your baby.

347
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:53,607
Oh, God. Oh, God.

348
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:55,476
Jenny, listen, I can fix this.

349
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,145
I can operate and make sure
that it doesn't bleed.

350
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:00,347
Surgery? Unh-unh.

351
00:13:00,382 --> 00:13:02,549
If we do surgery, my mom
will find out for sure.

352
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:03,550
Maybe she should.

353
00:13:03,585 --> 00:13:05,070
I mean, don't you want
your mom's help and...

354
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,191
No!

355
00:13:06,438 --> 00:13:10,107
She'll send me away o-or
make me give my baby away.

356
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:13,235
Can't you just give me some pill
to make it stay the way it is?

357
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:14,803
We could give it time.

358
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,738
Keep you under close observation.

359
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:19,574
And there's a chance that it
could resolve on its own.

360
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:21,643
Then let's do that. We'll wait.

361
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:23,778
Jenny, it's far less dangerous

362
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:25,113
to do something about it right now.

363
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:26,848
I think if your mom had the information,

364
00:13:26,883 --> 00:13:28,483
- she would... she would opt...
- You said we can wait.

365
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,285
I want to wait.

366
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:31,853
Okay.

367
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:34,155
Then we wait.

368
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,860
The better option is surgery.

369
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:40,829
The only reason she's choosing to wait

370
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,964
is to avoid telling her
mother that she's pregnant.

371
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:45,800
She has the right to tell
her mom when she's ready.

372
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:47,836
She's 14!

373
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,438
She needs her mom's help
to make this decision.

374
00:13:50,473 --> 00:13:53,308
Y-You're thinking like a mother
because you're about to be one,

375
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:54,509
but you're not.

376
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:55,610
You're not her mother.

377
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:57,379
We're her doctors.

378
00:13:57,413 --> 00:13:58,947
What if it were Sofia?

379
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:00,849
April! We can't.

380
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:03,852
We can tell her about the splenic
bleed, but not about the pregnancy.

381
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,854
She's just gonna put her
baby and herself at risk.

382
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,489
Jenny's the patient.

383
00:14:07,523 --> 00:14:09,057
She has the final say.

384
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:11,793
It's the end of the discussion.

385
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,764
This day is already on my nerves.

386
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:25,297
I've rounded on both Grey
and Torres' services.

387
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:27,014
I've finished their post-op notes.

388
00:14:27,048 --> 00:14:28,983
My beautiful, genius brain

389
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:30,050
is on fire.

390
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:31,018
I'm gonna get this grant.

391
00:14:31,052 --> 00:14:33,821
My beautiful, genius
brain is being wasted.

392
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:35,689
I've got to hold hands
with a hot rock star

393
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:37,491
while Blake assists
with his brain surgery.

394
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:39,059
Ooh, wait. Back up.

395
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:41,061
No, no, don't.

396
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:42,629
He's hot, but he's nasty hot.

397
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:44,331
Like in-your-face hot.

398
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,467
He keeps aggressively eye-sexing me.

399
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:48,869
He's not my kind of thing.
It's a distraction.

400
00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:51,238
Oh, God, I haven't had sex in so long.

401
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:53,540
Oh. I had sex this morning.

402
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,777
I thought we were sharing.

403
00:14:56,811 --> 00:15:01,248
The point is, Shepherd needs
to see me shine today,

404
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:03,817
and there is Blake being all shiny, too.

405
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,352
I knew it.

406
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:07,755
You hate that Shepherd is
taking Blake under her wing.

407
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:09,423
Because it's my wing!

408
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:12,326
Blake has been on neuro
for, what, two weeks?

409
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,495
And she gets to scrub in over me?

410
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:15,496
Really?

411
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,331
Blake probably can't
even clip an aneurysm.

412
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:18,365
- Stephanie...
- No.

413
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,733
Come on, she's from Dillard.

414
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:29,746
All right, listen, I know
you don't want to, but...

415
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:31,168
No, you listen.

416
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:33,881
She sat across that table,
looked my son in the eye,

417
00:15:33,915 --> 00:15:36,383
didn't say a damn thing
about the pregnancy,

418
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:38,385
treating him like he's
some inconvenience,

419
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,853
and he is the baby's father.

420
00:15:39,888 --> 00:15:40,788
Well, that may be true,

421
00:15:40,822 --> 00:15:42,456
but we should be helping
them through this.

422
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,792
What choice do we have
other than to fight?

423
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:45,959
A lawsuit, though?

424
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:48,629
If Jackson can make a case
that April committed fraud,

425
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:51,598
he's get a shot at getting
full custody of that baby.

426
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:54,368
If April's gonna fight
dirty, Jackson can, too.

427
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:56,370
- This is about my grandchild.
- Oh, really?

428
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:57,938
Because I don't see a grandchild.

429
00:15:57,972 --> 00:15:59,773
All I see are two kids in trouble.

430
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:01,742
And they aren't your kids.

431
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:03,510
Maybe just keep your
opinions to yourself.

432
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,315
Understood.

433
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:10,417
But you're my wife.

434
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:11,385
And I think I should be able

435
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:12,886
to tell you when you're
making a wrong turn,

436
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,588
and this is a very wrong turn.

437
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,963
I can't believe we
sat in traffic for an hour.

438
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:24,498
You can just relax. We made it.

439
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:26,400
What are they doing? Are they
already recovering the heart?

440
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:29,303
No, no. Hunt, something's wrong.

441
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:30,204
Hey, what are you doing to our heart?

442
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:31,805
Crapped the bed about two minutes ago.

443
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,806
You guys are Grey-Sloan?

444
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:33,841
- What are you saying?
- Lidocaine.

445
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,109
It's in V-fib. Arrhythmic.

446
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:37,344
We're trying to keep it pumping
to perfuse the other organs.

447
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:38,312
Okay, move aside. Let me see.

448
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:40,981
You told me this was a
good healthy heart!

449
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:42,516
He became hyperkalemic.

450
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,650
We tried to reverse it with insulin.

451
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:44,651
Then why is it fibrillating now?!

452
00:16:44,686 --> 00:16:45,919
Okay, Hunt, just let me work.
Charge it 20.

453
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:46,571
Charge.

454
00:16:46,596 --> 00:16:48,422
We have no
heart, we have no liver.

455
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:50,190
One's no good without the
other, they'll reallocate it.

456
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,625
- Riggs?
- Clear!

457
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:56,029
Come on!

458
00:16:56,064 --> 00:16:57,865
Come on, baby! Come on!

459
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:09,109
It's gone.

460
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:10,310
This heart's dead. I'm sorry.

461
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,122
We need to do the
calculations with M.R.I.

462
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:24,124
I need someone to go
supervise Kyle's head frame.

463
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:25,125
- I can do it.
- I can do it.

464
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,426
Blake, go.

465
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,865
I was hoping to be in
the field, assisting.

466
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,967
I need you with Kyle. He likes you.

467
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:35,536
He thinks I'm a challenge.

468
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,403
Correctly.

469
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:38,572
Then challenge him. He'll be calmer.

470
00:17:45,346 --> 00:17:48,123
So, the Preminger Grant
nomination is tonight.

471
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:49,049
Edwards.

472
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,586
I'm not gonna discuss a
confidential recommendation.

473
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,555
I know. I'm not asking.

474
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:56,857
Mm.

475
00:17:56,891 --> 00:18:00,661
I'm just hoping you bear in
mind our significant history

476
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:02,062
- when making your recommendation.
- Edwards!

477
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:03,096
I'm not asking!

478
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:06,700
Edwards, look at me.

479
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:09,436
You and I are not allowed to discuss

480
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,372
whether or not I will
be singing your praises

481
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:15,042
to Dr. Bailey tonight.

482
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:16,677
To do so...

483
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:21,181
would be unprofessional,
unethical, and not at all cool,

484
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:24,251
so... I am not going to discuss it.

485
00:18:24,285 --> 00:18:26,553
- Understood?
- Understood.

486
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:27,554
All right.

487
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:36,964
She said, "She's from Dillard,"
like it's a welding school.

488
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:38,398
- And what'd you say?
- Nothing.

489
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:39,533
I just stood there.

490
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:40,467
Ouch.

491
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:42,202
I know, I know. I didn't have my words.

492
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:44,438
- Why didn't...
- Why didn't I have my words?!

493
00:18:44,472 --> 00:18:45,639
Well, just say your words now.

494
00:18:45,673 --> 00:18:46,573
Okay, okay.

495
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:47,808
I...

496
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:49,376
thought we were friends.

497
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,144
No. Weak. Better words.

498
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:55,048
I know this place can be competitive...

499
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,951
and that you can be an
insecure bitch sometimes,

500
00:18:57,986 --> 00:19:00,787
but you would not be
talking behind my back

501
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:02,556
if you weren't scared to death

502
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,825
that somebody might give
you a run for your money!

503
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:08,762
And I might be from
Dillard, but I am here now.

504
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:11,064
I'm right behind you,
breathing down your neck,

505
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:13,834
and I am a dark freakin' horse!

506
00:19:13,868 --> 00:19:15,969
Drop the mike and walk away.

507
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:22,576
And I'm having sex tonight.

508
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,745
Hey.

509
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:26,513
I'm inviting all you lovely people

510
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:27,781
over to the house tonight for dinner.

511
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:31,151
Oh. Like a... Like a dinner party.

512
00:19:31,185 --> 00:19:32,486
We're not doing that again.

513
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,420
Just takeout. Whatever.

514
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:34,621
Just come over at 8:00,
and I'll feed you.

515
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:36,857
But we have the nomination
meeting for the Preminger Grant.

516
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:37,824
Fine. 8:30.

517
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:40,627
Ben and Bailey will be
going home at 8:30.

518
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:41,828
I'm having great sex tonight.

519
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:43,263
I might be having sex tonight.

520
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:44,765
I mean, I don't know yet.
We don't really plan it.

521
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:48,168
You guys have to come.

522
00:19:48,202 --> 00:19:49,803
Amelia just moved back in,

523
00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:52,606
and Meredith and Amelia
need to ease into it, okay,

524
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,675
or it's gonna be... It'll be...

525
00:19:55,877 --> 00:19:57,444
It's gonna start as something small

526
00:19:57,478 --> 00:19:59,646
that will snowball into something big,

527
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:00,881
and there will be blood.

528
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:03,216
This thing is fragile.

529
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:06,186
But if you guys are there,
then it can stay nice.

530
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,154
Oh!

531
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:08,689
Oh, so, you want us to
come to be a buffer?

532
00:20:08,723 --> 00:20:10,624
Yes. Thank you.

533
00:20:10,658 --> 00:20:11,858
- Mm-hmm.
- Like a human shield?

534
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:13,493
You get it. So, you'll be there?

535
00:20:13,528 --> 00:20:14,661
- No. God, no.
- Sex.

536
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:19,800
So, for now, we wait to see if
your daughter's abdominal bleed

537
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:21,301
resolves on its own.

538
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:23,737
You think waiting is the best option?

539
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:25,505
Well, it's what Jenny wants.

540
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,908
Jenny is 14.

541
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:30,477
When I was 14, I was
stealing street signs

542
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:32,512
and getting knocked up
by my loser boyfriend,

543
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:35,082
so forgive me for not
trusting a 14-year-old

544
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:36,583
to make judgment calls.

545
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:38,418
I'm asking what you think.

546
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:41,555
I think that surgery
is the better option.

547
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:44,358
Then that's what we'll do.

548
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:46,026
Of course, you know, with surgery,

549
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,261
there are... are always risks.

550
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:51,698
Surgery would happen when?

551
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:54,701
Today or...

552
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:57,170
Actually, there is one more thing.

553
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:58,538
Dr. Kepner.

554
00:20:58,573 --> 00:21:00,607
What is it? What are
not you telling me?!

555
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:03,777
There is also the risk that
Jenny could lose her baby.

556
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:05,579
Her what?

557
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:07,414
Jenny is pregnant.

558
00:21:17,816 --> 00:21:19,345
- How long?
- Mom, listen...

559
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,337
How long?!

560
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:23,198
- I-I don't know.
- Like six months or something.

561
00:21:24,253 --> 00:21:25,954
Why would you tell her?!

562
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:27,542
Look at me, not them. Me.

563
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:31,933
How many times have I told
you, "Be careful, be smart"?

564
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:33,501
Not to end up like me.

565
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:35,136
How many times?!

566
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:37,806
Yeah, Mom, like a million times

567
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,762
that I am your biggest,
stupidest mistake!

568
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:44,023
Sorry I messed up your life so bad!

569
00:21:44,057 --> 00:21:45,491
Jennifer, that is not what I meant!

570
00:21:45,526 --> 00:21:48,427
And I'm sorry I'm
screwing my life up, too!

571
00:21:48,462 --> 00:21:49,595
Go ahead.

572
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,831
I'm just waiting for you to say it...

573
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:53,733
"This is not what we do, Jenny"!

574
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:55,067
It's not.

575
00:21:55,102 --> 00:21:56,435
You screwed this up.

576
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,603
She needed to know all the risks.

577
00:21:57,638 --> 00:21:58,771
- No, she didn't.
- Yes, she did.

578
00:21:58,805 --> 00:22:01,200
If she was gonna convince Jenny
to get that surgery, yes.

579
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,875
How's that going so far?

580
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:05,578
There's a risk either way.

581
00:22:05,612 --> 00:22:07,112
Are you done with your side?

582
00:22:07,147 --> 00:22:08,214
Ah, working on it.

583
00:22:08,248 --> 00:22:09,048
It's just these...

584
00:22:09,082 --> 00:22:11,083
Damn adhesions. Yeah, I see them.

585
00:22:11,117 --> 00:22:13,385
Yeah.

586
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,353
I've been here before.

587
00:22:14,387 --> 00:22:17,769
We need enough space to
get a secure closure.

588
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,461
I'm talking about Jackson.

589
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:20,596
Looped PDS.

590
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:26,435
Jackson's father could be
loving and generous and fun.

591
00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:29,371
He also could be a child...
selfish, spiteful.

592
00:22:29,406 --> 00:22:32,041
When we ended, he just
wanted to hurt me,

593
00:22:32,075 --> 00:22:34,443
so he took the only thing that mattered.

594
00:22:34,477 --> 00:22:36,078
He took Jackson.

595
00:22:36,112 --> 00:22:37,446
He took him across country,

596
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,448
thought he could take my boy from me

597
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:41,450
and that I would just roll over.

598
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:43,385
I told him he didn't know
who the hell he married.

599
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,754
I fought for my son,

600
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:47,589
and I'm not about to stop fighting.

601
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:52,561
Richard, war is ugly,
senseless, and scary as hell,

602
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:56,598
but there are some things
worth going to war over.

603
00:23:01,204 --> 00:23:03,238
Maybe you can close without me.

604
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:11,680
We can monitor each cell in his brain.

605
00:23:11,714 --> 00:23:13,649
Mm-hmm.

606
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:17,252
Dr. Shepherd, you have
plus 10 y, minus 20 on z.

607
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:19,088
Almost there.

608
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:20,589
Keep him talking.

609
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:23,292
Kyle, what kind of music do you play?

610
00:23:23,326 --> 00:23:24,693
Oh, now you want to get to know me?

611
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:25,661
Right now, it's my job.

612
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,629
How's he doing, Edwards?

613
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:30,332
Why don't you...

614
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:32,167
try to play me something?

615
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,609
Uh, persistent tremor. No improvement.

616
00:23:40,643 --> 00:23:42,211
Don't you think it's a little weird

617
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:44,546
that you're seeing the
inside of my brain

618
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:47,015
and you haven't seen the
inside of my apartment?

619
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,284
You do not know when to quit, do you?

620
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,854
Come on. Amuse me.

621
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,591
You said it's, like,
your job or something.

622
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,695
Dr. Shepherd, he's developed
a left facial droop.

623
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,029
Signal's getting distorted.

624
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,532
I have a small hemorrhage here.
What next?

625
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:05,501
Uh, pull back on the
probe, close him up,

626
00:24:05,535 --> 00:24:06,368
and wait for the bleed to stop.

627
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:07,302
Or you can control the bleed right now.

628
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:09,571
Use a biopsy needle to
irrigate the bleed,

629
00:24:09,606 --> 00:24:11,673
then dilute and suction until it stops.

630
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,008
Good call, Edwards.

631
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:14,376
Biopsy needle.

632
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:17,012
I ca... I can't feel parts of my face.

633
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:17,913
What is happening?

634
00:24:17,947 --> 00:24:19,581
You have a very small
bleed in your brain.

635
00:24:19,616 --> 00:24:21,917
Don't worry... Dr. Shepherd
has it under control.

636
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:23,785
Syringe. Blake, now.

637
00:24:25,054 --> 00:24:25,921
What's she doing?

638
00:24:25,955 --> 00:24:28,991
She's free-styling.

639
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:31,426
She's a rock star, too.

640
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:33,462
All right, I'm right here.

641
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,567
What happened?

642
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:40,602
I was giving her a
routine abdominal exam

643
00:24:40,637 --> 00:24:42,037
when her pressure bottomed out.

644
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:44,706
It hurts... so much.

645
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:45,407
Tell me what's wrong.

646
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:48,610
We're gonna take a look, okay?

647
00:24:48,645 --> 00:24:51,580
She's hypotensive,
and her crit's at 18.

648
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:53,882
- Tell me what's happening.
- It's not labor.

649
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:55,784
Your aneurysm has ruptured,

650
00:24:55,818 --> 00:24:57,119
and I know you didn't want surgery,

651
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:57,920
but now we have no choice.

652
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,254
We're gonna get you into the O.R.

653
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,723
- Mom?
- They've got you, honey.

654
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:03,425
Everything is gonna be fine.

655
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,701
- What a waste.
- How's that?

656
00:25:12,735 --> 00:25:14,102
Such a waste.

657
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,604
The heart.

658
00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:16,471
I'm sorry for your guy.

659
00:25:16,506 --> 00:25:18,307
Well, maybe if we'd gotten here sooner.

660
00:25:18,341 --> 00:25:19,775
Well, it wouldn't have
made a difference.

661
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,276
The heart was in V-fib. Damage was done.

662
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,711
- They should have known...
- You're right, you're right.

663
00:25:22,745 --> 00:25:23,645
It couldn't have been your fault.

664
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,780
It was never your fault,
not with Amelia...

665
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,114
I didn't know, all right?

666
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,883
If I caused her a problem, I'm sorry,

667
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:30,485
- but she didn't tell me...
- Disaster happens wherever you are

668
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,120
because you are there, like with Megan.

669
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:32,921
All right, no!

670
00:25:32,956 --> 00:25:34,723
Owen, I'm not gonna do this again!

671
00:25:34,757 --> 00:25:36,558
- No?
- Okay, no! All right?!

672
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,432
I think you're starting
to drive yourself crazy.

673
00:25:43,466 --> 00:25:44,800
It's him.

674
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,735
At some point, you just
have to learn to let go.

675
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:49,404
Amelia took that drink.

676
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:50,973
It doesn't matter who offered it to her.

677
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,774
She would tell you that herself.

678
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:55,410
Riggs tried to talk your
sister off that chopper.

679
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:56,845
What?

680
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:58,113
She needed to be with her patient.

681
00:25:58,147 --> 00:25:59,681
He tried to go. She wouldn't let him.

682
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:03,986
- That's what he told you... t-that he...
- That's what he told me.

683
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,489
Meredith, he didn't say anything to her.

684
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:10,692
He wasn't anywhere near that chopper.

685
00:26:10,727 --> 00:26:14,296
He was off screwing some woman
from Supply Corps... again.

686
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,832
That's why Megan got on the chopper...

687
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:17,866
to get away from him.

688
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,667
My sister was leaving him.

689
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:21,270
When I said we hate him, I meant it.

690
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:27,775
You hanging in there, Kyle?

691
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:32,233
- Oh, hey.
- You're all right.

692
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,258
Loss of speech is normal.

693
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:35,060
It's temporary, okay?

694
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,029
Hey. It'll come back.

695
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:38,430
Dr. Shepherd's almost done.

696
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,833
Stay with me, Kyle. Almost done.

697
00:26:43,495 --> 00:26:44,795
You're okay.

698
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,945
Give me a minute.

699
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,570
Dr. Shepherd, there isn't any...

700
00:26:47,604 --> 00:26:48,750
She said give her a minute.

701
00:26:57,156 --> 00:27:00,592
Bleeding has stopped.

702
00:27:00,627 --> 00:27:02,694
Kyle, check your hand.

703
00:27:02,729 --> 00:27:05,030
Okay.

704
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,195
No tremor.

705
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,764
Okay, can you...

706
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,832
speak now?

707
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,371
You miss me?

708
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,975
Welcome back, Kyle.

709
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:26,443
I showed you my moves.

710
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,978
Time to show us yours.

711
00:27:28,012 --> 00:27:29,546
All right, come on.

712
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,915
Your turn to free-style.

713
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,659
This wasn't my fault.

714
00:28:16,794 --> 00:28:18,996
Telling the mother.

715
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,098
Stress doesn't just cause
arteries to rupture.

716
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,200
- You know that.
- I do.

717
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,468
Doesn't make it right.

718
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:25,636
It felt right.

719
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,970
It felt like she needed to know,

720
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,138
like it was the right thing to do.

721
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,139
I know the feeling.

722
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,442
This is not the same thing!

723
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,611
I'm just saying that I know...

724
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,712
how...

725
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,949
you felt...

726
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,851
in that moment.

727
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,519
I know.

728
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,664
Mm.

729
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,566
Turn around.

730
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,867
Oh.

731
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,969
God bless your heart.

732
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,470
Mm.

733
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,639
I'm glad you told me...

734
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,541
about Jackson's father.

735
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,077
Now you understand why I'm doing this.

736
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:08,645
Not a bit.

737
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,581
Ah.

738
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,150
It was an awfully sad story.

739
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,253
But it was your story, not theirs,

740
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,755
and stop trying to make it theirs.

741
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,490
I don't have a choice, Richard.

742
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,160
The woman I married...

743
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:26,196
believed in second chances...

744
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:29,666
that anything was possible...

745
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:34,538
and that the glass doesn't
always have to be half empty.

746
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,707
And you said your ex-husband

747
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:39,509
didn't know the woman he married.

748
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,544
Well, I do.

749
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:46,342
I'm only letting you yammer on

750
00:29:46,376 --> 00:29:48,077
because your hands are so magical.

751
00:29:48,111 --> 00:29:49,345
Lower.

752
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:51,714
Well, that's a start.

753
00:29:56,686 --> 00:29:59,522
We had to remove your spleen
to stop the bleeding.

754
00:29:59,556 --> 00:30:01,157
But the baby's fine.

755
00:30:01,191 --> 00:30:03,125
Good fetal heartbeat, very strong.

756
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,693
And my mom?

757
00:30:04,728 --> 00:30:06,595
She's waiting to see you...

758
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,596
whenever you're ready.

759
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:09,431
Yeah?

760
00:30:09,466 --> 00:30:10,499
Okay. Warren.

761
00:30:23,013 --> 00:30:24,146
Is she okay?

762
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:25,648
She is.

763
00:30:25,682 --> 00:30:27,349
And the baby?

764
00:30:27,384 --> 00:30:28,150
They're both fine.

765
00:30:28,185 --> 00:30:30,553
- Mom.
- Don't speak.

766
00:30:30,587 --> 00:30:33,656
Listen.

767
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,958
This just...

768
00:30:35,992 --> 00:30:37,626
isn't what we do.

769
00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:42,731
You tell me when you're in trouble.

770
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:45,834
You don't walk around scared and alone,

771
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:47,236
not when you have me.

772
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,038
- Do you hear me?
- Uh-huh.

773
00:30:49,072 --> 00:30:51,207
Not when you're having my grandbaby.

774
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:06,222
Hey.

775
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:08,591
Hi.

776
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:14,496
Listen, what I said before,
that was just me being...

777
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:15,764
Insecure.

778
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:18,200
I deserve that.

779
00:31:18,235 --> 00:31:19,835
You could have said a lot worse.

780
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:21,670
I did... earlier.

781
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:24,006
I'm very sorry.

782
00:31:27,944 --> 00:31:29,878
The attendings got out of their meeting.

783
00:31:29,913 --> 00:31:31,780
Already? Did you hear anything?

784
00:31:31,815 --> 00:31:32,781
Uh, yeah.

785
00:31:32,816 --> 00:31:34,783
I heard that Penny applied,

786
00:31:34,818 --> 00:31:37,753
which is weird because
she didn't say anything.

787
00:31:37,787 --> 00:31:38,754
You applied? When?

788
00:31:38,788 --> 00:31:39,888
Today.

789
00:31:39,923 --> 00:31:41,223
The deadline was at noon,

790
00:31:41,258 --> 00:31:43,225
and I decided I should at least try,

791
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,294
even if I don't really have a chance.

792
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:46,629
Oh, you have a chance.

793
00:31:46,663 --> 00:31:48,964
Alex told me that your
name came up... a lot.

794
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:52,468
Actually, uh, Grey had your back.

795
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:53,535
- Shepherd even.
- Shepherd?

796
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,704
I just don't understand
why you didn't tell us.

797
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:57,573
You pretended to be all cheerleader-y.

798
00:31:57,607 --> 00:31:59,275
It's just... EIt's a little... - Snaky.

799
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:01,744
I wasn't trying to hide anything.

800
00:32:01,778 --> 00:32:04,580
Wow.

801
00:32:04,614 --> 00:32:05,748
Never saw it coming.

802
00:32:07,484 --> 00:32:08,817
Well played.

803
00:32:08,852 --> 00:32:11,654
I wasn't playing anything.

804
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:13,622
- I just decided...
- Yeah. Wow.

805
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:17,726
Good luck.

806
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:27,436
On the 8th, he had...

807
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,239
4.2 just to make s...

808
00:32:33,677 --> 00:32:35,744
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

809
00:32:37,447 --> 00:32:38,814
Mate, this has to stop.

810
00:32:38,848 --> 00:32:40,482
Oh, you're right. This has to stop.

811
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:43,252
Megan called me right before she...

812
00:32:44,521 --> 00:32:45,788
All right, she told me...

813
00:32:45,822 --> 00:32:47,856
everything.

814
00:32:47,891 --> 00:32:49,591
So, yeah, you should just stop...

815
00:32:49,626 --> 00:32:50,693
'cause I see you.

816
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:51,760
You can't do this.

817
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:52,828
You can't just come in here

818
00:32:52,862 --> 00:32:54,430
and pretend to be some nice guy,

819
00:32:54,464 --> 00:32:59,201
pretend to be this hero and
lie and fool everyone,

820
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:02,771
like Grey and Bailey
and Pierce and Amelia.

821
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:04,773
You can't just take more
people away from me.

822
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:06,675
You can't do it, and I won't let you.

823
00:33:16,523 --> 00:33:18,090
Benjamin Warren!

824
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:19,925
Miranda Bailey.

825
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,420
You didn't submit your application

826
00:33:22,445 --> 00:33:23,779
for the Preminger Grant!

827
00:33:23,813 --> 00:33:25,281
No. Of course I didn't.

828
00:33:25,315 --> 00:33:26,179
But what do you mean, "of course"?

829
00:33:26,202 --> 00:33:27,819
You're asking me why I
didn't apply for a grant

830
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:29,408
that's gonna take me across the country?

831
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:31,110
W-What, am I supposed
to jump at the chance

832
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:33,546
to leave my wife and kid for a...
a year or more?

833
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,781
But it was an incredible opportunity.

834
00:33:35,816 --> 00:33:37,349
We could have figured something out.

835
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:38,684
You know, it's... it's not my turn.

836
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:39,485
Not right now.

837
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,687
You're Chief. We need to be here.

838
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:43,355
And you're okay with that?

839
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,692
Well, it'll be my turn sometime.

840
00:33:46,727 --> 00:33:48,761
You know, and when it is, you'll, uh...

841
00:33:48,795 --> 00:33:50,696
You'll do the same for me.

842
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:51,731
Right?

843
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:00,606
Come on.

844
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,644
So...

845
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,413
who'd you pick, Chief?

846
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:09,648
- Are you kidding me?
- It's me.

847
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:12,318
I read the e-mail five times
to see where I got it wrong,

848
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,552
but I didn't.

849
00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:14,353
I won.

850
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:16,222
Bailey gave me the Preminger Grant.

851
00:34:16,256 --> 00:34:17,990
Are you kidding me?!

852
00:34:18,024 --> 00:34:19,658
Why do you keep saying that?

853
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:21,494
Oh, no.

854
00:34:21,528 --> 00:34:23,629
No, yeah. N... Well, it's just...

855
00:34:23,663 --> 00:34:25,431
Yay, you!

856
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:28,601
Come on, let's go celebrate.

857
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,675
You recommended Blake?

858
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,611
I recommended you.

859
00:34:38,645 --> 00:34:40,613
Well, then why did Karev say you...

860
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:43,249
Then Blake's name came
up from a few people.

861
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:45,651
They asked my opinion.
And what did you say?

862
00:34:45,685 --> 00:34:46,852
Well, I'm not gonna
tell you what I said.

863
00:34:46,887 --> 00:34:50,356
I gave an honest answer to a question.

864
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,091
You sunk me.

865
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:54,794
I endorsed you.

866
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:56,662
After that, it's out of my hands.

867
00:34:56,696 --> 00:34:58,197
You have been trying to find a way

868
00:34:58,231 --> 00:34:59,932
to get rid of her for months,

869
00:34:59,966 --> 00:35:03,636
and to use this, you
go right past somebody

870
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,137
who you know deserves it more...

871
00:35:05,172 --> 00:35:06,372
someone who has been there for you,

872
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:09,809
who stepped in when you couldn't
even handle doing your job.

873
00:35:09,843 --> 00:35:12,478
Edwards.

874
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,513
This is the attendings' lounge.

875
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,206
Are you all right?

876
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,908
Am I all right? Yeah.

877
00:35:44,945 --> 00:35:47,513
You lost that shine in your eyes.

878
00:35:47,547 --> 00:35:48,547
I liked that shine.

879
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:51,700
I'm fine. I'm shiny.

880
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:56,722
All right, I just played a
private concert for you

881
00:35:56,756 --> 00:35:59,325
with my brain open.

882
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,193
I think you can give me something.

883
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:03,429
I got screwed over by a friend today.
That's all.

884
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:05,264
The redhead?

885
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:06,699
Mm.

886
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:08,367
That sucks.

887
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:10,236
Mm-hmm.

888
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:13,372
When I started playing, I had
all these musician friends.

889
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:16,342
And, you know, we'd hang,
and we'd jam together.

890
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:18,510
We grew up together, you know.

891
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:21,580
And then I started booking
gigs, selling out those gigs,

892
00:36:21,615 --> 00:36:24,183
and, you know, I had the
fans and the girls,

893
00:36:24,217 --> 00:36:25,351
and it was fantastic.

894
00:36:25,385 --> 00:36:26,886
It was everything we had hoped for.

895
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,023
It was... It was everything we
had talked about, you know?

896
00:36:31,057 --> 00:36:33,926
And then when I went to
share it with them...

897
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,728
they weren't there.

898
00:36:35,762 --> 00:36:36,560
All my friends were gone.

899
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:37,476
Poof. Just like that.

900
00:36:37,512 --> 00:36:40,080
But it turns out they
weren't my friends.

901
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:42,065
They were my competition.

902
00:36:46,927 --> 00:36:48,347
You and I are a lot alike.

903
00:36:48,381 --> 00:36:50,682
Okay, how is that?

904
00:36:50,717 --> 00:36:52,517
Well, you're smart.

905
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,138
Mm.

906
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:54,350
Incredibly good-looking.

907
00:36:54,385 --> 00:36:56,152
Cocky.

908
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:57,754
But with the goods to back it up.

909
00:36:57,788 --> 00:37:01,357
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go to sleep...

910
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:03,395
'cause my head hurts.

911
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,788
I'm supposed to watch you.

912
00:37:05,822 --> 00:37:07,389
I'm okay with that.

913
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:21,737
I had a crappy day.

914
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,339
Mm, me too.

915
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:25,441
I found out why Owen hates Riggs.

916
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:26,509
I don't want to know.

917
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:27,510
Okay.

918
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:29,111
Do I want to know?

919
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,013
I'm here!

920
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:32,948
We can see that.

921
00:37:32,983 --> 00:37:34,650
Really? With the cabinets?

922
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:36,418
- Sorry.
- You open, you close.

923
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:37,620
It's not that big a deal.

924
00:37:37,654 --> 00:37:38,821
It's tedious.

925
00:37:38,855 --> 00:37:40,689
Oh, my God, I was promised sisters.

926
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:42,658
I just got you guys
back in the same house.

927
00:37:42,692 --> 00:37:44,293
I've never had sisters. It's nice.

928
00:37:44,327 --> 00:37:46,028
But it's going to implode.

929
00:37:46,062 --> 00:37:47,696
You know it, and I know it.

930
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:49,832
So have at it.

931
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:52,001
Go to town over the cabinets.

932
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:54,203
If you're gonna kill each
other, just do it already.

933
00:37:54,237 --> 00:37:55,871
I can't keep this family
together by myself.

934
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,706
Nobody asked you to.

935
00:37:57,741 --> 00:37:59,141
We're adults. We're going to fight.

936
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,142
A lot.

937
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:01,377
I'm annoying.

938
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:02,444
She is.

939
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:05,047
But I don't plan on kicking
her out anytime soon.

940
00:38:05,081 --> 00:38:06,715
So, are you good?

941
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,551
I'm not homeless.

942
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:10,786
- I'm good.
- Good.

943
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,489
Though Maggie is starting
to get on my nerves.

944
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:14,523
Agreed.

945
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,792
Well, you wanted sisters.

946
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,694
You got 'em.

947
00:38:18,728 --> 00:38:19,862
Close the cabinet.

948
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,806
I was just on my way to your place.

949
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,642
I really don't have time for
one of your lectures now, Mom.

950
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:36,312
No, I was coming to say
that I was sorry, to...

951
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:38,147
- ...to apologize.

952
00:38:38,181 --> 00:38:40,749
- I doubt that.
- No, let me finish.

953
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:44,186
I overstepped, but you are my baby,

954
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,255
and if somebody messes
with you, watch out.

955
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:47,656
I...

956
00:38:47,691 --> 00:38:50,392
Well, I was just protecting my baby.

957
00:38:50,427 --> 00:38:52,862
- You know I'm a grown-ass man, right?
- Language.

958
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:56,932
As long as I'm living, my
baby forever you will be.

959
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:00,736
But...

960
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,037
I do need to let go.

961
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:04,073
Roots, wings.

962
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:05,741
You can fight your own battles.

963
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:07,109
Yes, I can.

964
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:09,879
And if you don't want
to fight April on this,

965
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:11,180
maybe there is another way.

966
00:39:11,214 --> 00:39:12,948
I mean, we're still all family.

967
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,583
Maybe you can go to counseling,

968
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,118
or I could get the two of
you in a room together,

969
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:17,286
and we could...

970
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,554
Sorry.

971
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:20,723
I... This is gonna take some practice.

972
00:39:20,757 --> 00:39:22,791
This...

973
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:24,526
Honey, what are you going to do?

974
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:26,295
I'm an Avery.

975
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:30,366
Somebody messed with my baby,
so I got myself some power.

976
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:48,484
I'll round on Jenny in the
morning after you've been in.

977
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:50,753
All right, good night.

978
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:53,289
I think Jackson's gonna sue me...

979
00:39:53,323 --> 00:39:55,090
for custody.

980
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:57,893
Full custody once the baby's born.

981
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:00,629
His mother... She is... awful.

982
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,299
I overheard her saying it,
and I just want to...

983
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:06,502
I... I am... I am so...

984
00:40:06,536 --> 00:40:07,636
mad.

985
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:08,837
I am furious.

986
00:40:08,872 --> 00:40:11,240
I feel like my skin is on fire!

987
00:40:11,274 --> 00:40:12,808
Oh, my God.

988
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:13,642
Sorry. I know. I'm ranting.

989
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,077
But I don't have anyone to talk to,

990
00:40:15,111 --> 00:40:16,912
- and I need to talk to someone.
- No!

991
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

992
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:19,348
And I've been treating you like crap...

993
00:40:19,382 --> 00:40:22,518
You need to talk to me. It's fine.

994
00:40:22,552 --> 00:40:25,988
I'm here... for whatever
you need, 'cause...

995
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:27,456
we're friends.

996
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,857
Rant away.

997
00:40:28,892 --> 00:40:30,659
And then...

998
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:31,827
we'll think about what to do.

999
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:36,365
I already thought of what to do.

1000
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:39,601
I'm not gonna be the victim.

1001
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:40,803
He can't do this.

1002
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:43,204
I won't let him.

1003
00:40:44,374 --> 00:40:46,141
April, what did you do?

1004
00:40:46,176 --> 00:40:48,110
What happens when the gloves come off

1005
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:50,112
and you stop hiding behind your mask?

1006
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:53,449
I just don't want to...

1007
00:40:53,483 --> 00:40:54,350
hurt her.

1008
00:40:54,384 --> 00:40:56,885
You know, it's in my power not to, so...

1009
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,354
- Hey.
- Here's to that.

1010
00:40:58,388 --> 00:40:59,788
Do you need a drink?

1011
00:40:59,823 --> 00:41:00,856
Hey! Dr. Avery.

1012
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,024
Yeah.

1013
00:41:02,058 --> 00:41:03,359
Dr. Jackson Avery?

1014
00:41:03,393 --> 00:41:04,493
That's right. Do we...

1015
00:41:04,527 --> 00:41:06,395
You've been served.

1016
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:07,563
Have a good night, guys.

1017
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:10,299
What's your next move?

1018
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:15,037
Do you take your best shot
and see where it lands?

1019
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:24,013
Or do you hang back, wait a minute,

1020
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:25,481
and see if you get sucker-punched?

1021
00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:33,689
"I don't want to fight.

1022
00:41:33,723 --> 00:41:36,191
Whatever you want to do, we'll do."

1023
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:38,594
It's your move.

1024
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:41,096
Oh, no.

1025
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:46,402
A restraining order.

1026
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:49,705
April filed a restraining
order against me.

1027
00:41:50,757 --> 00:41:53,550
You can either retreat
or go out swinging.

1028
00:41:54,421 --> 00:41:56,122
So, what you gonna do?

1029
00:41:56,547 --> 00:42:00,586

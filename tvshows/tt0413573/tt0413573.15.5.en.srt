1
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:08,290
Every day, we're surrounded

2
00:00:08,325 --> 00:00:11,700
by people who ask how we're doing.

3
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:14,051
So, do you want to...

4
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:16,210
say the Serenity Prayer before you go in?

5
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:20,356
Okay. Uh, just don't do drugs.

6
00:00:20,391 --> 00:00:22,358
And have a nice day at school!

7
00:00:24,428 --> 00:00:27,096
But when surgeons ask how you're doing,

8
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:29,098
we genuinely care about your answer.

9
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:30,333
You okay?

10
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:32,969
Just thinking about all the ways
I would have ditched school

11
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:35,185
to go get high when I was her age.

12
00:00:35,973 --> 00:00:38,408
So, what? You wanna
just stay here all day

13
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:40,376
in case she leaves or...?

14
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:42,075
How many heroin overdoses did you treat

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,011
- in the E.R. this week?
- Hm.

16
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:45,163
Let's just drive around the school

17
00:00:45,188 --> 00:00:46,382
and make sure she doesn't
ditch out the back.

18
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:47,583
- Okay.
- Okay.

19
00:00:47,618 --> 00:00:49,052
Your answer to "How are you doing?"

20
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:50,820
tells us how good a job we're doing

21
00:00:50,854 --> 00:00:52,455
at taking care of you.

22
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:54,824
Mnh. That was an accident.

23
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:56,459
You're the restaurant's best server,

24
00:00:56,493 --> 00:00:58,061
and you accidentally spill coffee

25
00:00:58,095 --> 00:01:00,163
on the most annoying
customer of all time?

26
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:01,764
She totally deserved it.

27
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,666
I knew it!

28
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:06,269
You know, I had to pay for her
stupid, ugly jacket with my tips.

29
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:07,970
As I recall, I chipped in.

30
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:10,640
Unfortunately, caretaking
outside of medicine

31
00:01:10,674 --> 00:01:12,342
is usually more complicated.

32
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:13,910
Your triple espresso.

33
00:01:13,944 --> 00:01:16,779
And I mailed in your ballot.

34
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:18,815
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

35
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:21,150
Morning, Chief.

36
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,153
Richie.

37
00:01:24,188 --> 00:01:25,288
Lincoln.

38
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:29,359
- Did he just call you Richie?
- Yeah.

39
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:31,661
He says if I insist
on extending his name,

40
00:01:31,695 --> 00:01:33,596
he's gonna shorten mine.

41
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,131
- Rude.
- Oh, no, no, no.

42
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:36,933
He's a good guy. Mean guitar player.

43
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:38,434
Yeah. Link's the best.

44
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:39,773
You know, we go all the way
back to undergrad.

45
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:40,937
Oh?

46
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:43,005
Oh, no! No, no, no. Not like that.

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,508
We just waited tables together.
He's like my brother.

48
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:47,043
Okay, I'm gonna head to the lab,

49
00:01:47,077 --> 00:01:48,678
but I hope to see you later.

50
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,149
I-I wasn't too thrilled

51
00:01:53,183 --> 00:01:56,386
when I found out Catherine
and Koracick were...

52
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,987
- old friends.
- Can I help you?

53

How did you find me?

59
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:44,934
You used to make Cristina

60
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:46,817
get you coffee here every morning.

61
00:02:47,444 --> 00:02:49,679
And I figured you wouldn't
be stupid enough to fly,

all things considered.

63
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,583
Pierce told you.

64
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:55,685
Well, there goes her license.

65
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,420
We all know you're not gonna sue Pierce.

66
00:02:57,454 --> 00:02:59,155
You have bigger problems.

67
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:06,362
- Good morning.
- Morning, Parker.

68
00:03:06,397 --> 00:03:07,664
What do we got first?

69
00:03:07,698 --> 00:03:09,699
Cece Colvin. Post-heart transplant

70
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,201
with secondary renal failure

71
00:03:11,235 --> 00:03:13,102
- due to her anti-rejection meds.
- Mm.

72
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:15,638
Uh, did you know she's
a professional matchmaker?

73
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:16,573
Oh, I know.

74
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:18,508
I had to show her pictures
of my girlfriend

75
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:20,610
so she'd stop trying to set me up.

76
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:21,811
Hey.

77
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:23,179
Welcome back, Dr. Avery.

78
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:24,781
Thanks, Parker. Give us a minute, please.

79
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:30,986
Wasn't sure if you were
reading any of my texts.

80
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:33,790
Yeah. Um...

81
00:03:33,824 --> 00:03:35,792
You met a boy with, uh,
scapular osteochondroma,

82
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:37,393
so you pressed pause on your trip

83
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:39,229
to fly him and his family
here to operate.

84
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:40,563
Did you get my reply?

85
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:42,198
You mean the letter "K"? Yeah.

86
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,900
I thought you were a fan of brevity.

87
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:46,069
Maggie. Hold on, okay?

88
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:48,338
I know my trip was sudden.

89
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:50,839
I know this is sudden. I...

90
00:03:51,408 --> 00:03:52,842
I just really miss you.

91
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:54,711
Okay? I want us to be able to catch up.

92
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:56,346
Take you to dinner tonight.

93
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,803
Uh... look.

94
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,315
You've got surgery. I've got patients.

95
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,217
We can, uh, catch up later.

96
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,728
Hey. Uh. I'm... sorry. Am I late?

97
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:15,030
Uh, no. Couldn't sleep,
so I got a head start.

98
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,734
There is no way we will get through

99
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:19,569
all of these approaches in one year.

100
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:21,070
Well, we need to narrow them down.

101
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:23,673
We'll start with molecular vectors only.

102
00:04:23,707 --> 00:04:25,775
Process of elimination.

103
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:27,777
I need you to do a surgical consult.

104
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:29,746
- We're busy.
- Look, Grey, Shepherd, and Hunt

105
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,080
took last-minute personal days.

106
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:32,715
So I need you to put the future on hold

107
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,751
and take care of the patients
that exist in the present.

108
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:37,687
And your consult in my office,
refusing to leave.

109
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,422
Your husband's a grouch.

110
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:41,724
- You made him chief.
- You married him.

111
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:44,560
Hey, hey.

112
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:47,096
Howlin' Wolf Richie sings the blues.

113
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:49,565
Not at work? Right. Okay.
Sorry, Dr. Webber.

114
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,200
Helm, Schmitt, get over here.

115
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:56,673
Okay, Hunt is out,
so it's just us in the E.R.

116
00:04:56,707 --> 00:04:59,075
I'll handle the trauma. The three
of you take the rest of the pit.

117
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:00,743
Report to DeLuca here.

118
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:02,712
Grey Sloan prides itself

119
00:05:02,746 --> 00:05:05,548
on providing the highest
level of patient care.

120
00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:07,250
Your colleague Dr. Roy

121
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:09,519
was woefully short in that department.

122
00:05:09,553 --> 00:05:11,721
I expect you to do better.

123
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:13,723
- Okay, let's move.
- Okay.

124
00:05:13,757 --> 00:05:15,091
Thank you, Dr. Webber.

125
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,526
It's not a favor.

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,695
What do we have here?

127
00:05:20,764 --> 00:05:23,299
You still owe me a drink. Tonight?

128
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:27,437
Oh, um, I don't know.
I-I might have a... thing...

129
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:29,305
Dr. Kim, we could use you on Bed 3.

130
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,406
...later.

131
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:32,775
Okay. Well, if your thing changes,

132
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,054
I'll be at Joe's.

133
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:39,415
You turned down a date? With him?

134
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,384
What? No. It's not a date.

135
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:44,320
He asked you out to drinks. It's a date.

136
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:53,103
- Oh, hey, Karev.
- Have I got a present for you.

137
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:55,090
- Thought you were still on vacation.
- Not a vacation.

138
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:56,632
It was a personal leave while
I figured some stuff out.

139
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,000
You're not at work, it's a vacation.

140
00:05:58,035 --> 00:05:59,502
Searching for the meaning of life

141
00:05:59,536 --> 00:06:01,637
just means it's a boring vacation.

142
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:02,772
What's the present?

143
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:05,808
I've got an 11-year-old with
an extensive osteochondroma

144
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:07,276
in both scapulae, all right?

145
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:08,678
Wildest case of it I have ever seen.

146
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:10,143
- And it's pro bono.
- Pro bono?!

147
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:11,848
- I've met the family.
- How is that a present?

148
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:13,899
We're bleeding money out of every,

149
00:06:16,353 --> 00:06:18,688
Rafi, look who's here.

150
00:06:18,722 --> 00:06:20,256
Dr. Avery!

151
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,691
You're welcome.

152
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:23,860
Hey, buddy!

153
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:34,939
Ms. Sullivan? Hi. I'm Dr. Bailey.

154
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:35,966
This is Dr. Wilson,

155
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:38,002
- Karev.
- Karev.

156
00:06:38,036 --> 00:06:39,497
I'm here for Dr. Grey.

157
00:06:39,522 --> 00:06:41,222
Yes, Dr. Grey is unavailable,

158
00:06:41,257 --> 00:06:42,690
so we are going to be the o...

159
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,526
Wasting your time, all right?

160
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,195
I've already seen an internist,
two gastroenterologists,

161
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,531
and two surgeons who ran
dozens of inconclusive test

162
00:06:49,565 --> 00:06:51,833
before diagnosing me with acid reflux,

163
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:54,035
anorexia, and anxiety, none of which

164
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:56,171
are actually the cause
of my stomach pain.

165
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:57,806
So I'm here to see
the woman I read about,

166
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,407
the best, Dr. Meredith Grey.

167
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:02,377
And you have both made it clear
that you are not her,

168
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:04,866
so no thank you and goodbye.

169
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:06,701
Okay.

170
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:08,850
Ms. Sullivan.

171
00:07:08,884 --> 00:07:11,419
I'm am not Meredith Grey. This is true.

172
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:14,889
But I am the woman
who taug Meredith Grey.

173
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:18,426
Grey was a lump of clay when I met her.

174
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:20,829
And I shaped her with my two hands

175
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:22,764
into the surgeon that she has become.

176
00:07:22,798 --> 00:07:25,767
And I helped her with the mini livers.

177
00:07:29,738 --> 00:07:31,906
Dr. Karev is our chief
of pediatric surgery,

178
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,908
well, right now chief of everything.

179
00:07:33,943 --> 00:07:35,343
This is Rafi and Aamir.

180
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:37,011
Thank you so much for doing this.

181
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:38,913
- You mind if I take a look?
- Of course.

182
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:41,249
Hey, Rafi, can you lift your
arms above your head for me?

183
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:42,851
Oh, yeah.

184
00:07:44,787 --> 00:07:46,187
Alright. How'd you guys meet?

185
00:07:46,222 --> 00:07:47,856
Uh, hiking in Oregon.

186
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,524
We were both at the same creek,

187
00:07:49,558 --> 00:07:51,860
and they made me some amazing s'mores.

188
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:54,696
Rafi loves to swim, even
when it's freezing outside.

189
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,065
And skip rocks and climb trees.

190
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:59,367
- Basically anything outdoors.
- When Rafi was 8 years old,

191
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:01,603
he was diagnosed with
multiple osteochondromas.

192
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:04,105
They're benign overgrowths
in my bones and cartilage.

193
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,363
They're hereditary.

194
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:07,375
He explains it to people
about five times a day.

195
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:09,043
Tell you what we're gonna do here,

196
00:08:09,078 --> 00:08:10,612
is we're gonna shave your bones down

197
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:13,481
and reshape them so they go from this...

198
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:15,216
to... this.

199
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:16,484
You're sure we should remove them now?

200
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,620
His pediatrician said we might
want to wait till he's older.

201
00:08:18,654 --> 00:08:21,526
No. I want them off now! They're weird.

202
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:23,892
That's okay. The risk isn't any
different if we do it now or later.

203
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:26,561
And he's in good hands. Avery
and I make an excellent team.

204
00:08:26,595 --> 00:08:28,329
Sorry I'm late.

205
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:30,398
I had to, uh, put a pin in a tibia.

206
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:32,467
What's up, little dude?

207
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:35,436
I'm Dr. Lincoln.
But you can call me Link.

208
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:38,139
- He's on this, too?
- He's head of ortho. Yeah.

209
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:40,341
Avery didn't tell me you were in on this.

210
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:41,509
Sweet.

211
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:43,411
Yeah. Sweet.

212
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:48,583
Alright. Your vitals look good,

213
00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:52,287
but I'd like to do another blood
panel and run another echo.

214
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:53,988
And?

215
00:08:54,023 --> 00:08:57,125
A little birdie told me
Dr. Avery's back in town.

216
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:01,496
It was that or talk about myself, so...

217
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,465
Ah. Yes, Cece. Dr. Avery
is back temporarily.

218
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,034
He's here to do a complex surgery,

219
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:07,421
and then he's off again.

220
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:10,138
So you're sad he's in town
for such a short time.

221
00:09:10,172 --> 00:09:12,473
Sure. Let's go with that.

222
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:15,580
I'll be back to do your echo
after I finish my rounds.

223
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,813
What happened between them?

224
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,281
- I don't know.
- Parker!

225
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:24,118
When I was 14,

226
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:27,055
I got alcohol poisoning in
the middle of the school day.

227
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:28,556
Did I ever tell you that story?

228
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:30,491
Um, Bailey told me there was this app

229
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:32,393
you can put in your kid's phone
to track them.

230
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:33,728
- Yeah. Already done.
- Oh.

231
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:35,129
I'm not proud of it.

232
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:38,032
And this app... tracks her texts.

233
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:39,567
Oh. That's a little...

234
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:41,502
Invasive? Extreme?

235
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:43,037
- Mm.
- There was this text

236
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:44,806
about a bunch of kids
cutting class today.

237
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,694
- That's why we're here.
- Listen, you're a recovering addict

238
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:50,845
raising a recovering addict,
and you care about her.

239
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,547
That's gonna make anyone a little...

240
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:53,915
Insane?

241
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:55,620
I was gonna say obsessive.

242
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:59,554
Delete them.

243
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:01,889
If I do it, I will just
get sucked back in.

244
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:04,726
Okay.

245
00:10:06,962 --> 00:10:08,329
All gone!

246
00:10:08,364 --> 00:10:10,398
No need to know the details
of her lunch...

247
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:12,533
...with Rachel and Eileen.

248
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:14,168
They're having lunch? Mm.

249
00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:15,621
- That's good!
- Mm-hmm.

250
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,271
They seem like nice girls.

251
00:10:17,306 --> 00:10:19,440
And it's so hard to make friends
when you transfer.

252
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:21,509
How did I become this person?

253
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:23,511
I kind of like this person.

254
00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:27,615
Okay, Helm, go get some
ABD and conform to dress this.

255
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,384
- Mm-hmm.
- Dr. Webber.

256
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:31,252
Got a small lac on the forehead
and on the calf,

257
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:33,588
but I just finished repairing the leg.

258
00:10:33,622 --> 00:10:35,523
Hmm. Is there a problem, Schmitt?

259
00:10:35,557 --> 00:10:37,425
The edges don't want to line up.

260
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:38,626
Well, I can see that.

261
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:40,628
DeLuca, you have any advice for him?

262
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:42,290
Throw a corner stitch on the apex first.

263
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:43,438
Then the rest will line up.

264
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:45,933
- Come on. You know that.
- Right. Sorry.

265
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:51,939
Look, um, Schmitt's just
a little distracted.

266
00:10:51,974 --> 00:10:53,708
I-I think he's got a thing for Helm.

267
00:10:53,742 --> 00:10:56,077
Is that his excuse or yours?

268
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:59,028
It's not an excuse, Dr. Webber.
It's just an explanation.

269
00:10:59,062 --> 00:11:00,448
Well, you could have fooled me.

270
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:01,716
You and Schmitt were on the same patient,

271
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,451
and you didn't notice
that he needed help?

272
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:05,086
Show some initiative, DeLuca.

273
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:09,957
I, uh, I-I already ate breakfast,

274
00:11:09,992 --> 00:11:11,626
if that's what's happening.

275
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,701
Oh, no. I have to make cookies
for Zola's bake sale.

276
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:15,963
And they have to be homemade

277
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:17,665
because, apparently,
that's how you show you care.

278
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,501
And Zola wants chocolate.
Not chocolate chip. Chocolate.

279
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:22,103
And did you know there's a difference

280
00:11:22,137 --> 00:11:24,572
between cocoa powder
and hot-chocolate mix?

281
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:25,773
- Not a baker?
- I just learned

282
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:27,241
that you had to pre-heat the oven.

283
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:28,676
Well, you know what? You look busy.

284
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:30,645
So I'm just gonna take off.

285
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,313
Oh, just stay.

286
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:34,082
Make sure I don't burn the house down.

287
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:36,250
- Okay.
- See?

288
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:37,872
You'll get to do all of this soon,

289
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:39,587
bake cookies, look for childcare,

290
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:41,122
find a good school.

291
00:11:41,156 --> 00:11:42,824
And there it is.

292
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:44,592
Look, Meredith, I'm gonna
go back to Germany.

293
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:46,994
I've got a great O.B. in Landstuhl,

294
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:49,664
and I'll give birth there
and raise the baby myself.

295
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:50,965
And not tell Owen?

296
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:53,334
Well, I was planning to tell him,

297
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:54,869
and I was going to apologize

298
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:56,704
for all the awful things
that I said to him,

299
00:11:56,739 --> 00:11:58,606
and then I came back here and found out

300
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,007
that they were all true.

301
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:01,642
Oh. It's not what you think.

302
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:02,643
Oh...

303
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:05,046
He's not living with
his ex-wife and two kids?

304
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,848
Okay, well, that part is true.

305
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:08,382
But he's fostering a baby,

306
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,885
and she's helping the mom
get her life together.

307
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,507
I just...

308
00:12:13,422 --> 00:12:15,823
I-I don't see how it would work.

309
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:17,625
Then why are you here?

310
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:18,993
- You stalked me.
- No, no.

311
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:20,695
Why are you in Seattle?

312
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:23,197
And don't blame the clot
because we both know

313
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:24,799
that you could jump on a bus or a train

314
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,834
if you really wanted to get out of town.

315
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:29,370
I don't know,
okay? I don't, Well, I-I just,

316
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:31,639
I don't know why I'm here
or, or what I'm gonna do.

317
00:12:31,673 --> 00:12:34,575
I've been holed up in
a very fancy hotel room

318
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,811
running an exorbitant room-service bill

319
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:38,546
trying to figure it out,
and I still don't know.

320
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,414
And it's driving me crazy
and pissing me off.

321
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:42,750
And what are you doing to those eggs?!

322
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:44,519
Here. Gimme.

323
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:47,922
I don't need the fork.

324
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:55,208
All right. Let's see what we got here.

325
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:01,652
Okay, here's your mitral valve.

326
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:04,388
So, why's Dr. Avery in the doghouse?

327
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,591
Let's focus on you, okay?

328
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,960
This is me focusing on me.

329
00:13:09,994 --> 00:13:11,762
If something's eating away at you,

330
00:13:11,796 --> 00:13:13,997
I'd just as soon we get it out now

331
00:13:14,032 --> 00:13:16,834
before you have my heart in your hands.

332
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,871
It's the way he left.
He made this huge decision to go

333
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:23,307
and then told me by voicemail,

334
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:25,609
then barely communicated
once he was gone.

335
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:26,777
Who does that?

336
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:28,979
I mean, I get having big questions.

337
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:31,782
So go. Go seek your truth,
follow your heart.

338
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:33,484
Just don't freeze me out.

339
00:13:33,518 --> 00:13:35,385
What are your big questions?

340
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:38,889
When is he coming back?

341
00:13:38,923 --> 00:13:41,892
Does he even want to be
in a relationship?

342
00:13:41,926 --> 00:13:44,766
Why does he keep texting me
pictures of trees?

343
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:49,199
Not questions about him.

344
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:51,068
About you.

345
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:01,879
Link, how we looking on your side?

346
00:14:01,913 --> 00:14:04,848
It's coming along. Bone saw.

347
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:06,817
Brooke was telling me about your wedding.

348
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:07,985
That sounds like quite a day.

349
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,586
- Brooke?
- He means Jo.

350
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:12,167
Jo. Sorry. Still getting used to that.

351
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:14,925
You guys knew each other, then?

352
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,560
School. And we worked together.

353
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:18,395
Oh. What hospital? Jimmy's Crab Shack.

354
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,264
Hey, Avery, how was
your leave of absence?

355
00:14:25,236 --> 00:14:28,361
Uh, yeah, it's going great.
I got a few weeks left.

356
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:30,019
I'm gonna head down to Santa Barbara.

357
00:14:30,054 --> 00:14:32,362
Then I haven't decided
between Yosemite and Zion.

358
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:34,296
- Ooh, Zion. Hands down.
- Really?

359
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,031
Angels Landing, it's up like 6,000 feet,

360
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,599
and you're on this teeny little trail

361
00:14:37,634 --> 00:14:39,335
with a chain as a handrail.

362
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:40,769
Yeah. I want to try that.

363
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:42,438
What about you, Chief? You hike?

364
00:14:42,472 --> 00:14:45,441
- I'm from Iowa.
- The path report's back.

365
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,812
- Thought you said it wasn't malignant.
- Damn it.

366
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:52,881
The HIDA scan and the ERCP were negative.

367
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,316
Which rules out

368
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,552
the gallbladder and biliary tree.

369
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:58,988
Yeah. I told you that a half-hour ago.

370
00:14:59,022 --> 00:15:01,190
Okay. We know that,
but this is how we work.

371
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:03,192
Yeah, yeah. Process of
elimination. I get it.

372
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:05,294
We do the same thing
down at my auto shop.

373
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:07,997
I'm a mechanic, and I learned
everything I know from my dad.

374
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,865
He ran that shop for 45 years

375
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,561
then retired and passed it on to me...

376
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:14,303
along with that lunch pail.

377
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:16,505
Which you brought for good luck?

378
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:18,407
Which I brought with me for lunch.

379
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:20,242
I'm constantly fasting for all
the tests you doctors order,

380
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:22,678
so I bring myself a sandwich
for when I'm done.

381
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:25,347
Um, I want to run a technetium scan

382
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,577
to rule out Meckel's diverticulum.

383
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,652
- It's not that.
- You've been tested?

384
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:32,855
No, but I read about it online.

385
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,824
Okay. The Internet does not
provide accurate diagnoses.

386
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:39,061
Yeah, well, far as I can tell,
neither do you.

387
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:43,766
You were the one who insisted

388
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,868
that I tell Megan Hunt
about me and Riggs.

389
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:47,436
Because you were her surgeon.

390
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,538
Because she deserved all the information.

391
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:51,273
Is that what this is about?

392
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:54,109
You blaming me for
breaking up you and Riggs?

393
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:56,078
No. broke up me and Riggs.

394
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:59,281
But Owen is my friend,
and Amelia is my sister.

395
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:00,716
Right.

396
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,785
- Not about me.
- You're his best friend.

397
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:04,286
Well, I was. Not anymore.

398
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,355
- I can't be.
- Why?

399
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:08,390
Because I hate him, Meredith.

400
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,460
I hate him so much,
I want to smash his face in.

401
00:16:11,494 --> 00:16:13,562
I mean, I can't even look at him.

402
00:16:13,596 --> 00:16:15,431
How the hell can I raise
a child with him?

403
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,268
I grew up without my dad

404
00:16:19,302 --> 00:16:23,305
because my mother hated him
too much to let him love me.

405
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,808
One day, your kid will go
looking for their dad.

406
00:16:25,842 --> 00:16:27,743
They're not gonna find
a deadbeat or a drunk.

407
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:30,379
They're gonna find a good man
who's devastated.

408
00:16:30,413 --> 00:16:33,315
Do you hate him enough
to do that to either of them?

409
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:39,321
Stop eating all his
snacks. I'm ordering food now.

410
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:41,256
- Mm.
- Morning, folks!

411
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,425
Jim Blomquist, Vice Principal.

412
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,661
The security guard said you've been
parked out here a couple hours?

413
00:16:45,695 --> 00:16:48,097
Yeah, uh, we're waiting
for someone, a student.

414
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:49,665
- Mm.
- Oh. You're parents?

415
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:53,135
Uh, no. Yeah. Um...
Kind of hard to define.

416
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:54,403
Uh...

417
00:16:54,437 --> 00:16:56,438
Yeah. Betty Nelson, uh, lives with us,

418
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,241
and I foster her, her baby, so...

419
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:01,443
See? There's not really a name for that.

420
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,679
Well, you can't loiter
here in a school zone,

421
00:17:03,713 --> 00:17:05,814
so you're gonna have to move on,

422
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,449
Mr. and Mrs., uh...

423
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,251
Uh, oh, no, no, we're,
we're, Well, we're, we're,

424
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:10,919
We'll just go.

425
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:13,622
Yeah. We're gonna go.

426
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:15,858
He has cancer?

427
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:18,360
We caught it early. That is good news.

428
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:20,496
But we had it biopsied more than once.

429
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,498
Yes, I understand, and things can change.

430
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:23,632
They mutate,

431
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,368
and if the specimen is not
taken from a cancerous area,

432
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:28,470
then it goes undetected.

433
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,775
Now, I can remove the scapula entirely

434
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,344
and take the cancer with it.

435
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:37,779
Or I can just remove the growths,

436
00:17:37,814 --> 00:17:42,384
which would mean he'd require
radiation treatments,

437
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,353
which can be dangerous
in a child this young.

438
00:17:44,387 --> 00:17:48,123
His mom died in childbirth.
He's all I have.

439
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:51,393
If I remove the scapula,

440
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:54,396
he is going to have severely
limited range of motion.

441
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,366
His prosthetic's gonna have
to be replaced as he grows.

442
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,937
But the cancer will be gone.

443
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,838
Okay? He'll live.

444
00:18:04,507 --> 00:18:06,408
I didn't want to give you my s'more.

445
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:08,911
What's that?

446
00:18:08,945 --> 00:18:11,680
When we saw you at the creek, Rafi said,

447
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:13,715
"That guy's all alone. We should share."

448
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,585
And I thought, "I'm tired and hungry,

449
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:19,888
and I don't want to give
a random stranger my dessert."

450
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:22,591
But I did. To make him happy.

451
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,194
And now what, what you're saying

452
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:27,362
is that s'more is gonna save his life?

453
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,033
Thank you.

454
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:32,762
Do what you need to save him.

455
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:35,571
I absolutely will.

456
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,942
Ugh. There should be an hour every day

457
00:18:43,976 --> 00:18:45,567
where this whole city has to chill.

458
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,228
Seattle Nap Time, no one gets hurt,

459
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:49,380
and we all get to go to the bathroom.

460
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:56,650
It's not a date.

461
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:58,719
- Mm.
- I owe him a drink.

462
00:18:58,753 --> 00:19:00,554
Are you saying this...

463
00:19:00,588 --> 00:19:02,656
...so it's more surprising
when he kisses you?

464
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,324
Hey, guys! Wake up!

465
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,194
What the hell happened?

466
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:09,730
Uh, M-Molly Graham.
19 years old. Asthmatic.

467
00:19:09,764 --> 00:19:12,399
I gave her two nebulizers
and a shot of Solu-Medrol.

468
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:14,534
- I'm monitoring her sats.
- No, you're not!

469
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:16,603
She's tachypneic.
Her sats are in the 80s.

470
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:19,005
She's decompensating, okay?
She's not moving any air around.

471
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,108
Okay, we're gonna have to
intubate. Prep for RSI.

472
00:19:21,142 --> 00:19:22,909
- Don't we need an attending?
- Do you see one?

473
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:24,678
I'll, I'll get Webber.

474
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:28,615
Okay. Hang in there for me, Molly, okay?

475
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:32,786
Let's go, Helm. Let's go.

476
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:37,284
Okay.

477
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:40,293
Come on. Come on.

478
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:42,062
It's not going in. Uh, okay, get a scope.

479
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,734
Come on, Molly. It's okay. You got this.

480
00:19:50,304 --> 00:19:52,539
Let's go! Give me that, Helm.

481
00:19:54,108 --> 00:19:55,344
Okay.

482
00:19:56,911 --> 00:19:58,645
Okay.

483
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,448
Come on. Come on. Got it.

484
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:08,488
No. Helm, I got it.

485
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:15,295
She was about to code.

486
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:16,897
I didn't think you'd
want me waiting for you.

487
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:18,265
You were right.

488
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,134
But next time, try including your intern.

489
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:23,455
This is a teaching hospital.

490
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:29,418
So, is it like a Magic 8-Ball?

491
00:20:29,452 --> 00:20:30,744
Sort of.

492
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:34,247
Except it's a lot easier
to hide in study hall.

493
00:20:34,282 --> 00:20:36,416
How have you never seen one?

494
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:38,285
Study hall was for homework.

495
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,120
We would not have been friends.

496
00:20:40,154 --> 00:20:41,922
Okay. So...

497
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:43,990
should we stay parked out here all day?

498
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,359
- What do you think, Leo?
- Leo, what do you think?

499
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:49,963
No? Nothing?

500
00:20:52,573 --> 00:20:54,501
It says "yes, definitely."

501
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:56,536
Are you serious?

502
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:58,532
This is how I picked my college.

503
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:00,507
Ask a question.

504
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,342
Uh, has Amelia lost it?

505
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:04,177
Excellent. Now pick a color.

506
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:06,881
- Red.
- R-E-D.

507
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:08,607
- Now pick a number.
- 2.

508
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,638
5.

509
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:16,990
"100%." See? It works.

510
00:21:18,926 --> 00:21:20,971
Amelia. It's Betty.

511
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:24,898
Okay. What do we do?

512
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:41,281
Okay. We're staying.

513
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:46,720
Ooh. You are some kind of genius.

514
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:48,499
Well, I just followed the recipe.

515
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:49,943
- So did I.
- You know what?

516
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:53,326
That's my problem, is I just
follow. I play it safe.

517
00:21:53,361 --> 00:21:55,161
You joined the Army during a war.

518
00:21:55,196 --> 00:21:56,674
You don't play it safe.

519
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:59,402
No. That wasn't brave.

520
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:01,285
That was Allison.

521
00:22:01,402 --> 00:22:02,536
Who's Allison?

522
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,838
My favorite person on the planet
died in the second tower,

523
00:22:04,872 --> 00:22:07,007
which was a month after I buried my mom

524
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,967
and a year after I buried my dad.

525
00:22:09,001 --> 00:22:12,512
She was... She carried me.

526
00:22:13,786 --> 00:22:17,951
And when she died, I wished
that I had gone with her.

527
00:22:17,985 --> 00:22:19,520
I get that.

528
00:22:19,554 --> 00:22:22,188
New York was our city. I didn't
how to live there without her.

529
00:22:22,223 --> 00:22:26,059
So I went to Iraq, which is
where I started working

530
00:22:26,093 --> 00:22:29,563
with this buttoned-up,
brilliant surgeon who just,

531
00:22:29,597 --> 00:22:31,197
He didn't have any doubts at all.

532
00:22:31,232 --> 00:22:33,583
He was such an optimist,
which I couldn't stand.

533
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,841
He didn't try to fix me
or tell me how to grieve.

534
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:37,810
He was just there, and he was kind,

535
00:22:37,844 --> 00:22:39,312
and I fell in love with him.

536
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:41,714
But he had a fiancée, and
I didn't want to lose him

537
00:22:41,748 --> 00:22:43,683
'cause I couldn't lose anyone else.

538
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:48,142
So I played it safe.

539
00:22:49,256 --> 00:22:51,562
I don't hate Owen. I...

540
00:22:52,526 --> 00:22:54,360
I love him.

541
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:01,488
Isn't that your patient?

542
00:23:03,603 --> 00:23:06,138
It was, but we found a Ewing.

543
00:23:06,173 --> 00:23:08,074
Caught it early, so...

544
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:09,875
hopefully we can get all of it.

545
00:23:11,712 --> 00:23:13,212
That's amazing.

546
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:18,351
Yeah. It's kind of a miracle
I was able to...

547
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:20,753
find him when I did.

548
00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:25,091
You don't sound like somebody
who just saved a boy's life.

549
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,426
Yeah, it's just...

550
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:28,994
Rafi's such an active kid.

551
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:31,897
He loves to swim and
climb trees and run around,

552
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:33,833
and he is gonna wake up and find out

553
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:35,576
he can't ever lift his own arm.

554
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,337
So I'm saving his life, but
he's not gonna see it that way.

555
00:23:38,372 --> 00:23:41,941
He's a little kid, a little kid
who wants to play,

556
00:23:41,975 --> 00:23:44,577
and I'm the guy that took
that away from him.

557
00:23:49,116 --> 00:23:50,383
My mom used to say that,

558
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:53,285
"Everything's clearer
on the mountaintop."

559
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,787
Hmm?

560
00:23:54,821 --> 00:23:59,191
Just, you know, when
you can get some distance,

561
00:23:59,226 --> 00:24:01,026
separate yourself from your problems.

562
00:24:01,061 --> 00:24:02,895
They all seem so solvable.

563
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:04,897
But then you get back into real life.

564
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:07,933
Nothing is black-and-white.
Everything is just all muddy.

565
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:10,936
"Everything is clearer
on the mountaintop."

566
00:24:13,106 --> 00:24:15,908
Guys, don't move! Don't move.
I'll be right there.

567
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,539
Radiation? I told you it'll fry his lung.

568
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,705
- And the bone's already out.
- Extracorporeal radiation.

569
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,357
The bone is already out, so we can do

570
00:24:27,391 --> 00:24:28,725
the radiation outside the body,

571
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,226
crank up that dose as high as we want,

572
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,561
basically like putting it in a microwave.

573
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,229
It doesn't hurt him, kills the cancer.

574
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,764
- And all the healthy cells.
- But that won't matter.

575
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:36,175
We replace the scapula,

576
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,034
and the framework's there
for new cells to grow back.

577
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:40,603
Exactly. It gives us a better match
than any prosthetic ever could.

578
00:24:40,637 --> 00:24:42,407
We re-attach the ligaments
in their natural position,

579
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:43,773
minimal loss of movement.

580
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:46,242
- And no more surgeries.
- Can we do this thing?

581
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,177
Hell yeah. Let's move.

582
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:33,850
- Attachment complete.
- Good hemostasis.

583
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,618
We are ready to close.

584
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:50,032
Unfortunately, we've exhausted

585
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,368
every test that we can think of.

586
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,758
Do, Do you understand what I'm saying?

587
00:27:16,326 --> 00:27:20,663
I understand. But I don't accept.

588
00:27:20,697 --> 00:27:23,266
I don't accept your failure
to diagnose me,

589
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,601
and I won't accept
discharge papers, either.

590
00:27:25,636 --> 00:27:28,170
So I'm gonna eat my sandwich,
and you're gonna go remember

591
00:27:28,205 --> 00:27:31,107
that you are the teacher
of Meredith Grey.

592
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:32,808
Uh...

593
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,915
Nina, w-we've run out of tests.

594
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:41,884
Then find new tests. Invent them.

595
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,586
Take care of me. That is your job.

596
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,954
Should I page psych?

597
00:27:44,988 --> 00:27:46,889
I can't keep living like this.

598
00:27:46,924 --> 00:27:49,025
I can't keep being told it's in my head

599
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:50,860
when I know that it's not.

600
00:27:50,894 --> 00:27:52,261
I can't keep being told

601
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,797
that I'm crazy when I'm not crazy.

602
00:27:54,831 --> 00:27:56,899
If you don't help me,
I'm gonna kill myself.

603
00:27:56,934 --> 00:28:00,002
And then all those doctors who said
it was in my head will be right.

604
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:03,457
But they're not right.

605
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:05,908
I know there's something wrong with m...

606
00:28:07,277 --> 00:28:08,611
Nina?

607
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,880
Okay. What is it?

608
00:28:10,914 --> 00:28:11,981
- What is it?
- Stomach!

609
00:28:12,015 --> 00:28:13,916
Here?

610
00:28:13,951 --> 00:28:16,687
Alright, Dr. Webber, uh, beds 1 and 2

611
00:28:16,721 --> 00:28:17,954
are ready to be discharged,

612
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:20,389
and neuro's on its way
to check the CHI in bed 6,

613
00:28:20,424 --> 00:28:23,759
but I did a preliminary check,
and I think he's okay.

614
00:28:24,488 --> 00:28:25,795
Uh...

615
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,498
Bed 2 is Helm's patient,
and 6 is Schmitt's.

616
00:28:31,368 --> 00:28:33,569
Yeah, well, you said show
some initiative, so...

617
00:28:33,604 --> 00:28:36,031
Initiative doesn't mean
doing everything yourself.

618
00:28:36,773 --> 00:28:38,774
Look, do you have some kind of
problem with me, Dr. Webber?

619
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:41,310
Oh, far from it. I consider you a friend.

620
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,218
A friend? You've been on my ass
all day for nothing.

621
00:28:44,252 --> 00:28:45,438
I haven't made a single mistake.

622
00:28:45,472 --> 00:28:46,849
I picked up everybody else's slack.

623
00:28:46,883 --> 00:28:49,418
So, if there's some lesson,
please enlighten me.

624
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:51,487
I don't need a friend
in the E.R., DeLuca.

625
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,022
I need doctors who not only

626
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:55,157
can give patients the best possible care,

627
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:56,959
but teach others to do the same.

628
00:28:56,994 --> 00:28:59,962
That's what separates
residents from attendings.

629
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:03,466
Don't get mad at me for
thinking you've got it in ya.

630
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,137
Ow. That hurts.

631
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:11,340
I know. Just try to relax, okay?

632
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,708
Do you hear something?

633
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:15,311
A swooshing sound?

634
00:29:15,345 --> 00:29:18,014
Like her sandwich digesting?

635
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:21,150
More like a vascular bruit.

636
00:29:21,184 --> 00:29:22,843
Um, here. Let's try the ultrasound.

637
00:29:22,877 --> 00:29:24,371
Sure.

638
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,661
And to the right.

639
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:34,330
I'm gonna press,

640
00:29:34,364 --> 00:29:36,332
- Aah! Ow.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

641
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:38,164
Uh, take a deep breath for me.

642
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,371
And exhale.

643
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:43,873
There!

644
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,842
Oh. The median arcuate ligament.

645
00:29:46,877 --> 00:29:48,811
- You've got MALS.
- Whoa!

646
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:50,546
I've only read about this.

647
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,850
A-A ligament is wrapped tightly
around your celiac artery.

648
00:29:54,885 --> 00:29:56,085
It expands when you eat.

649
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,586
You know, no one's found it

650
00:29:57,621 --> 00:30:00,256
because you always fast
before your visits.

651
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,591
We can go in laparoscopically, cut it.

652
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:04,827
Takes 20 minutes.

653
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,431
I knew it was real.

654
00:30:08,465 --> 00:30:12,435
Oh, yeah. This is a real thing.

655
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:15,237
- And we found it.
- Mm-hmm.

656
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,540
And Meredith Grey did not.

657
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:21,043
I thought this was gonna be easier.

658
00:30:21,078 --> 00:30:22,424
I-I don't know how to tell him,

659
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:23,879
but I don't know how to not tell him.

660
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:26,048
I feel completely out of control.

661
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,950
Oh, that's just the hormones.
That'll pass.

662
00:30:27,984 --> 00:30:30,519
Oh, it won't pass.

663
00:30:30,554 --> 00:30:33,089
I mean, nothing about this is gonna pass.

664
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,091
Well, the "out of control" will pass.

665
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,293
I mean, listen,
being a mom breaks you open.

666
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:38,794
It's supposed to.

667
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:40,129
I mean, is,

668
00:30:40,163 --> 00:30:42,932
Is that what happened to Amelia?

669
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,101
I mean, Owen said that she
didn't want to have kids,

670
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,235
that their marriage was a wreck.

671
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:47,870
I mean, he would call me and say that,

672
00:30:47,904 --> 00:30:49,371
"She's moved out. She's hiding from me.

673
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:51,073
She doesn't want to be married to me."

674
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:52,975
And I-I didn't know what to say to that.

675
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:56,579
I know that Amelia had
a brain tumor removed, and it,

676
00:30:56,613 --> 00:30:57,947
but is that what suddenly

677
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,082
made her want to have a family
and with Owen?

678
00:31:00,117 --> 00:31:01,951
I mean, did she change that much?

679
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,285
Meredith, is she all-in?

680
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,820
I don't know. I'm sorry.

681
00:31:04,855 --> 00:31:08,724
I can't speak for Amelia,
nor do I want to try.

682
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:11,260
What I do know is that you
do need to talk to him

683
00:31:11,294 --> 00:31:13,162
because the longer
you keep this a secret,

684
00:31:13,196 --> 00:31:15,398
the worse it gets for everybody.

685
00:31:15,912 --> 00:31:18,047
I mean, it's not like you're
gonna lose him. It's Owen.

686
00:31:18,735 --> 00:31:21,137
Meredith, I know that
I'm not gonna lose him.

687
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,281
It's, It's Owen.

688
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,309
He is good and honorable
and loyal and kind.

689
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:30,780
And when I tell him that
I'm carrying his child,

690
00:31:30,814 --> 00:31:32,099
he will claim me.

691
00:31:32,134 --> 00:31:33,783
And then for the rest of my life,

692
00:31:33,817 --> 00:31:35,951
I'm gonna wonder whether
he's with me out of obligation

693
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:38,454
or if he really wants to be with me.

694
00:31:41,057 --> 00:31:43,859
Hi, babies. How was school?

695
00:31:43,894 --> 00:31:45,094
- Good.
- Good.

696
00:31:45,128 --> 00:31:46,529
- Good?
- Mm. It smells so good in here!

697
00:31:46,563 --> 00:31:48,430
Yeah! Look what I have.

698
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:50,766
Teddy, everything you think you know

699
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:52,601
is gonna completely change
once the baby comes.

700
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:53,869
Cookies on the table.

701
00:31:53,904 --> 00:31:56,172
It's not you that you're telling him for.

702
00:31:58,074 --> 00:32:00,568
- Hey, you want me to take over?
- I got him.

703
00:32:01,178 --> 00:32:02,845
- You think I don't?
- No, no.

704
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,780
The opposite, actually.
I think you're great with him.

705
00:32:04,815 --> 00:32:07,116
So, what's with the staring?

706
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,119
I don't know. I just...

707
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,120
I keep kind of wondering,

708
00:32:11,154 --> 00:32:13,122
is this really what
broke up our marriage?

709
00:32:13,156 --> 00:32:15,976
Well, first of all, brain tumor.

710
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:17,426
I know. I know.

711
00:32:19,262 --> 00:32:21,197
And also...

712
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,698
Christopher.

713
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,633
- Who?
- My baby.

714
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:29,171
That was his name. Christopher.

715
00:32:31,174 --> 00:32:34,043
I have never said that out loud before.

716
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,979
Not even to myself.

717
00:32:37,113 --> 00:32:39,348
But I loved him...

718
00:32:39,382 --> 00:32:41,776
for every second of his life.

719
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,687
I loved him so much.

720
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,783
After he died, the pain was unbearable.

721
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:51,660
And I think I became afraid

722
00:32:51,695 --> 00:32:54,496
that loving another baby

723
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:58,167
would somehow lessen
Christopher's memory.

724
00:32:58,201 --> 00:33:00,170
But I'm okay.

725
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:02,738
I couldn't say his name before,

726
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,774
and now I feel like for
the first time in my life,

727
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:07,910
I can talk about him,
and I-I don't feel like

728
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,499
it's gonna break me, you know?

729
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:14,283
And I can look at Leo and Betty and,

730
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:16,144
and know that...

731
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,188
they can't erase him.

732
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:20,890
Nothing can.

733
00:33:22,158 --> 00:33:24,360
And that's a good thing.

734
00:33:33,534 --> 00:33:35,601
Oh. You found us.

735
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:38,171
Were you guys seriously out here all day?

736
00:33:39,606 --> 00:33:41,107
How was your day?

737
00:33:41,141 --> 00:33:43,242
Fine.

738
00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:44,677
That's all we're gonna get?

739
00:33:44,712 --> 00:33:46,079
Fine, and I didn't do drugs.

740
00:33:46,113 --> 00:33:47,547
That'll do.

741
00:33:51,318 --> 00:33:54,887
Does Owen wear dad jeans?

742
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,725
Okay. To your car seat.

743
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,193
"Yes, definitely."

744
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:06,199
Alright, I'm gonna go talk to Rafi's dad.

745
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:07,737
You earned it.

746
00:34:08,235 --> 00:34:09,521
Hey, could you hold up a sec, Chief?

747
00:34:09,556 --> 00:34:10,655
Why?

748
00:34:10,689 --> 00:34:12,872
Uh, because ever since you found out

749
00:34:12,906 --> 00:34:14,613
that Jo and I are friends,

750
00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:17,443
you've looked like you want to kill me.

751
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:21,214
Uh, so I just wanted to clear the air.

752
00:34:21,248 --> 00:34:23,282
There was nothing between us.
She's like my sister.

753
00:34:23,317 --> 00:34:24,754
Did you know Paul?

754
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:27,086
Because a good brother
would have protected her.

755
00:34:27,121 --> 00:34:29,255
You're twice that guy's size.
You could have leveled him.

756
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:30,475
I met him. I didn't like him.

757
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,158
I told her so. She didn't listen to me.

758
00:34:32,192 --> 00:34:33,659
I mean, Jo was not the best listener

759
00:34:33,694 --> 00:34:35,395
of other people's ideas back then.

760
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,763
Yeah. She still isn't.

761
00:34:36,797 --> 00:34:38,431
Well, I didn't like him,
and he didn't like me.

762
00:34:38,465 --> 00:34:40,900
Jo said he was jealous of our friendship,

763
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:42,301
and she started to back away.

764
00:34:42,336 --> 00:34:44,404
I-I thought I was being respectful.

765
00:34:44,438 --> 00:34:46,317
I had no idea he was...

766
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,841
I didn't like the guy,
but I swear to God,

767
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:52,578
if I had known, yeah...
I would've leveled him.

768
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,801
Hey.

769
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,794
Well...

770
00:35:07,828 --> 00:35:09,462
I'm still mad at Jackson.

771
00:35:09,496 --> 00:35:11,397
Kind of.

772
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:14,534
But I think, uh, mostly I'm mad at me.

773
00:35:14,568 --> 00:35:17,132
'Cause you're right.
I have big questions.

774
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:18,532
And I haven't been asking them

775
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:19,972
because I've been wrapped up
in everyone else's,

776
00:35:20,007 --> 00:35:21,474
which needs to stop.

777
00:35:21,508 --> 00:35:23,075
So, thank you.

778
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:26,045
So happy for you, Maggie.

779
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,914
I don't suppose you also came in here

780
00:35:27,948 --> 00:35:30,316
to tell me you found a donor?

781
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,984
Not yet.

782
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:33,653
But I haven't given up hope yet.

783
00:35:33,687 --> 00:35:35,855
And neither should you. Deal?

784
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,324
Deal.

785
00:36:01,482 --> 00:36:06,118
♪ The thrill is gone

786
00:36:41,522 --> 00:36:43,142
Hey. Schmitt, you made it.

787
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,771
I may have misread the situation.

788
00:37:00,374 --> 00:37:01,744
Sorry.

789
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:13,085
Hey. I scheduled Nina's laparoscopy

790
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,854
for first thing tomorrow.

791
00:37:14,888 --> 00:37:16,956
Great.

792
00:37:19,693 --> 00:37:23,195
I-I know that we have
a lot of approaches,

793
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,298
but that's good, right?

794
00:37:25,332 --> 00:37:27,166
The, The right one's in there somewhere.

795
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,068
I'm not worried about that.

796
00:37:31,572 --> 00:37:32,939
What is it?

797
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:35,028
Okay. Process of elimination.

798
00:37:35,576 --> 00:37:40,546
I have systematically removed
stressors from my life,

799
00:37:40,581 --> 00:37:43,716
less coffee, more exercise, better food.

800
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,351
I'm still stressed.

801
00:37:45,385 --> 00:37:49,055
I've taken on fewer patients.
Still stressed.

802
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:52,191
So I took the extreme measure

803
00:37:52,225 --> 00:37:54,794
of stepping back from the job

804
00:37:54,828 --> 00:37:58,760
I have spent my entire career
working for.

805
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:02,568
And even though your husband
now has all that stress,

806
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:04,003
I'm still stressed.

807
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:08,936
So if I'm rational, if I'm scientific,

808
00:38:09,943 --> 00:38:12,478
I must look elsewhere for
the source of that stress.

809
00:38:12,512 --> 00:38:14,046
What else is there?

810
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,323
My husband...

811
00:38:20,921 --> 00:38:22,588
is a firefighter.

812
00:38:22,623 --> 00:38:24,857
I haven't heard from him today.

813
00:38:24,891 --> 00:38:28,498
And when I don't hear from him,
I don't breathe.

814
00:38:29,196 --> 00:38:32,298
Okay. Ben Warren adores you.

815
00:38:34,568 --> 00:38:36,631
I know his job is scary, but...

816
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,884
you two are good.

817
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:41,140
You two are the goal.

818
00:38:43,477 --> 00:38:47,546
Good work today.
I'll see you in the morning.

819
00:38:47,581 --> 00:38:51,517
Surgeons are trained
to provide care for others.

820
00:38:59,396 --> 00:39:00,503
He's okay?

821
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,695
He's gonna experience
a little pain for a while

822
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:04,463
and have to do physical therapy,

823
00:39:04,498 --> 00:39:06,465
but, yeah, everything looks good.

824
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,868
He did great in there.

825
00:39:12,472 --> 00:39:13,773
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

826
00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:15,608
Thank you so much.

827
00:39:21,181 --> 00:39:23,215
Some biologists
believe it's human nature,

828
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,650
the desire to help.

829
00:39:31,925 --> 00:39:34,068
Can I kiss you, please?

830
00:39:35,462 --> 00:39:36,796
We did it.

831
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:39,598
We saved his life...
and his quality of life.

832
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:41,567
- Congratulations.
- No, no. "We," okay?

833
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:43,263
Both of us. You, it was your idea.

834
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,304
You know, we did this together.

835
00:39:45,338 --> 00:39:47,493
Are you leaving again tomorrow?

836
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:49,942
No. No. I'm done being gone.

837
00:39:49,976 --> 00:39:52,344
This is where I feel most connected

838
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:54,013
to something larger than me,

839
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:56,482
in the O.R., doing something
that I'm great at.

840
00:39:56,516 --> 00:39:58,084
I had an amazing day today,

841
00:39:58,118 --> 00:40:00,353
best day I've had in a very long time,

842
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:01,854
and you are a huge part of that.

843
00:40:04,558 --> 00:40:08,861
I apologize for the way
that I left, truly, okay?

844
00:40:09,515 --> 00:40:11,497
That will not happen again.

845
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:14,633
I can't have dinner with you tonight.

846
00:40:15,902 --> 00:40:19,400
I need to work on my rechargeable hearts.

847
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,109
Jackson, this is, this is my mountaintop.

848
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:24,710
They may not be able to help Cece,

849
00:40:24,745 --> 00:40:26,846
but they're gonna help
a lot of other people.

850
00:40:29,182 --> 00:40:31,517
But, yes. Please do kiss me.

851
00:40:36,389 --> 00:40:38,324
Scientists believe we're biologically

852
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:39,962
programmed to empathize.

853
00:40:41,328 --> 00:40:42,661
I think it's one of the reasons

854
00:40:42,696 --> 00:40:44,630
our species has lasted this long.

855
00:40:44,664 --> 00:40:46,732
You're coming home.

856
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:48,701
I was in an O.R. all day. I'm behind.

857
00:40:48,735 --> 00:40:50,669
So, be behind. We're newlyweds.

858
00:40:50,704 --> 00:40:52,638
We should be doing newlywed things.

859
00:40:52,672 --> 00:40:54,340
Mm. Like what?

860
00:40:54,374 --> 00:40:56,542
Um, if you can't think of anything,

861
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,010
then I want an annulment.

862
00:40:58,044 --> 00:41:00,746
Okay. Okay. I'm coming.

863
00:41:02,682 --> 00:41:04,750
I heard you worked with Link today.

864
00:41:04,785 --> 00:41:08,087
Yep. Seems like a pretty good guy.

865
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:13,759
What are you doing?

866
00:41:17,864 --> 00:41:20,733
We have an innate instinct
to support each other.

867
00:41:22,569 --> 00:41:24,837
You can only take care
of yourself for so long.

868
00:41:24,871 --> 00:41:26,772
- Thank you.
- I should be thanking you.

869
00:41:26,807 --> 00:41:28,340
You made them. No, I meant for today.

870
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:30,409
It was nice to talk to someone
other than room service.

871
00:41:30,443 --> 00:41:31,443
Well, I'm always here.

872
00:41:31,478 --> 00:41:33,846
But I'm not the one
you should be talking to.

873
00:41:39,085 --> 00:41:41,420
Hello? Mer? Ooh, cookies!

874
00:41:43,456 --> 00:41:45,391
These are amazing.
What are you doing here?

875
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:46,859
I was just picking up some things.

876
00:41:46,893 --> 00:41:50,262
I think I'm gonna be at Owen's
a little longer than I planned.

877
00:41:50,297 --> 00:41:51,797
Because let's face it,

878
00:41:51,832 --> 00:41:55,267
some problems are way too big
to carry on our own.

878
00:41:56,305 --> 00:42:02,244

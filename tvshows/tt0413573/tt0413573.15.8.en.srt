1
00:00:05,152 --> 00:00:06,657
When we are hurt...

2
00:00:06,658 --> 00:00:09,124
our body send signals
to form blood-clots.

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,778
Directly at the injure to
help stop any bleeding

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,074

00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,510
Thanks.

6
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:31,073
Are you okay?

7
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:34,184
I lost control, Meredith.

8
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:38,755
I was angry,

9
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:40,931
and this bar...

10
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:43,485
it was just awful.

11
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:47,170
They're predators.
They're destroying lives.

12
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:49,539
It's our body's system
of checks and balances.

13
00:00:49,574 --> 00:00:52,375
Yeah, well, this wind is picking up.

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,732
We better get going.

15
00:00:53,766 --> 00:00:56,480
Catherine says you haven't
gotten a new sponsor

16
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,550
since Ollie died,

17
00:00:57,585 --> 00:00:59,516
you're not making meetings,

18
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,918
and now you're destroying bars.

19
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,823
You need to get your head right,

20
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,159
get your head in a place
where you can take care

21
00:01:09,193 --> 00:01:11,228
of the people who depend on you.

22
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:14,364
It's a system that's
supposed to save our lives.

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,234
Aah!

24
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:20,737
Or so we hope.

Okay... Ben?

28
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:32,682
Sorry I woke you,

29
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,185
but I, uh, I didn't know the rules

30
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:37,554
about using my key during our separation.

31
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:39,055
We are not separated.

32
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,590
We are taking time apart

33
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,393
so that I can focus
on bringing my stress down.

34
00:01:43,427 --> 00:01:44,494
It's a sabbatical.

35
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:45,529
Yeah, I know what you call it.

36
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,198
And even though
I'm not sleeping in this house,

37
00:01:48,232 --> 00:01:50,700
I still want the people
who live here to stay safe.

38
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,787
Wind storm's on the way.

39
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:53,036
It's supposed to get pretty ugly.

40
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,070
I, uh... I was gonna board up

41
00:01:54,105 --> 00:01:55,505
the windows before my shift...

42
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,406
Oh.

43
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,508
...if that's okay with you.

44
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:00,277
Yes, of course.

45
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:01,678
Just try not to wake up Tuck.

46
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:03,180
I will hammer the nails into the boards

47
00:02:03,214 --> 00:02:04,915
as quietly as possible.

48
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:07,601
I'll do Tuck's windows last.

49
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:13,190
Oh.

50
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,703
- Hey.
- Hi.

51
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,579
There's a... There's a tree down
over on Madison.

52
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,414
Yeah, I saw.

53
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,882
God, it's crazy out there.

54
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,784
They said it's only gonna get worse

55
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:42,285
throughout the day.

56
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,754
So, are we talking
about the weather, Maggie?

57
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,090
That's our new thing?

58
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,780
- Hey.
- Altman.

59
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:53,663
Am I gonna like the reason you're here?

60
00:02:53,698 --> 00:02:55,899
Well, I couldn't
sit in my hotel room today,

61
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,434
and you're gonna be inundated
with patients.

62
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,002
Hey.

63
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:02,005
Hey, any update on Betty?

64
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,473
- No.
- Nothing.

65
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:04,741
I'm gonna take Leo upstairs.

66
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:05,909
Yeah. See you, buddy.

67
00:03:05,943 --> 00:03:08,411
Ohh.

68
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,371
Nobody got much sleep last night.

69
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:12,582
Yeah.

70
00:03:12,617 --> 00:03:13,671
How much longer you in town?

71
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:16,370
Um, I'm... I'm not really sure,

72
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,355
but if you need help with
anything, just let me know.

73
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:19,589
Okay, thanks.

74
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:26,363
Their kid's been missing for three days.

75
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:27,797
I couldn't dump any more on them.

76
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,633
That's very thoughtful.

77
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:41,811
Oh, is, uh, Karev around?

78
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,513
His mess is.

79
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:45,633
Oh, uh, this is a matter for the chief.

80
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:47,651
Um, I'll come back later.

81
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:52,322
Uh, if you peel that tape,
you'll find my name,

82
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:55,158
and I'm here, which says
a lot more than Karev,

83
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:56,493
who seems to think "interim"

84
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,129
means "sloppy"
and "whenever he feels like it."

85
00:03:59,163 --> 00:04:02,434
So just say whatever it is.

86
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,570
Um, well, I was close

87
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:10,807
to Frankie Shavelson.

88
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,043
Oh.

89
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:16,546
Oh, yeah. I was so sorry to hear...

90
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,648
Are you all right?

91
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:21,217
Yesterday, I, um,

92
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:22,752
went into a bar and...

93
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:25,088
- Richard, no.
- I didn't drink,

94
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:28,043
and I didn't hurt anyone.

95
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:31,463
I lost my temper.

96
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:35,592
There was property damage,

97
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:38,678
and I was arrested.

98
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:44,341
Well, I'll need to inform the board,

99
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,443
and there will be an inquiry.

100
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:49,679
I do need to bench you for today.

101
00:04:49,714 --> 00:04:52,716
You'll get some rest, catch up on charts.

102
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,718
Just stay away from patients.

103
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,986
- Can you manage that?
- I can.

104
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,992
Thank you, Bailey.

105
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:08,598
Where the hell is Alex Karev?

106
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:20,777
Mm.

107
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:24,214
You have pillow marks on your face.

108
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:27,917
I haven't slept that hard
since I took that stupid job.

109
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:32,691
I'm gonna nap for like...
for like five more minutes.

110
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:36,426
I feel like I got at least eight hours.

111
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:39,763
Oh, crap!

112
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,398
Crap!

113
00:05:41,432 --> 00:05:42,499
What?

114
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,712
Okay, breathe in for me, Cece.

115
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:46,864
Good.

116
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,671
Oh, Dr. Grey,

117
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:50,740
I have something to show you.

118
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:52,242
I normally don't take pictures,

119
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:53,418
but I couldn't help it.

120
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:55,645
I snapped this one
while he wasn't looking.

121
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,947
Cece, save your strength.

122
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,750
He has distinctly kind eyes

123
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:03,686
and a playful sense of humor,

124
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:06,423
and he's a surgeon in this hospital.

125
00:06:06,457 --> 00:06:07,824
Dr. Lincoln.

126
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:09,192
Yeah, I know who he is.

127
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:10,427
And?

128
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:12,429
And, DeLuca, I'm waiting.

129
00:06:12,463 --> 00:06:14,531
Yes, uh, her respiration's
getting more labored,

130
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:16,099
she's complaining
of more shortness of breath.

131
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:17,867
It's probably the pleural effusions.

132
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:20,870
Meredith, I just showed you perfection.

133
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:22,705
And I don't have the time.

134
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,441
Have you looked at me?

135
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:26,176
I'm the one who doesn't have time.

136
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,677
Okay, so then I'll make it quick.

137
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:30,165
Let's prep her for a pleurocentesis.

138
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:33,049
Uh, hey, is, uh...

139
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,517
is everything okay?

140
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,719
Just check back in an hour.

141
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:44,861
Hey, did you check the weather?

142
00:06:44,895 --> 00:06:46,830
Do I ever check the weather?

143
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,798
Uh, it's windy. That's helpful.

144
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,800
Okay.

145
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:53,303
Oh, uh.

146
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:55,405
Well, t-they're telling everyone
to stay off the roads,

147
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,073
that there's three accidents on the I-5.

148
00:06:57,107 --> 00:06:58,908
The bridge is closed.
I mean, we're screwed.

149
00:06:58,943 --> 00:07:00,545
Yeah, well, if it's that bad,
then the hospital's slammed.

150
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:01,678
We need to go.

151
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,856
We can't help if we're dead.

152
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:17,894
No, no, no, Karev.
Stay there until it's safe.

153
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:20,263
We'll figure something out. We always do.

154
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:22,532
Okay, we got burns, car-wreck injuries,

155
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:25,768
and flying debris has given us
a ton of blunt injuries

156
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:27,604
and several penetrating traumas.

157
00:07:27,638 --> 00:07:29,906
Wind storms are my favorite.

158
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,407
Yeah, you're gonna love this.

159
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:49,759
We're supposed to lov this?

160
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:51,094
Oh, ho, ho.

161
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:53,763
Impalement-palooza.

162
00:07:53,797 --> 00:07:55,465
Bailey, I don't think we have room

163
00:07:55,499 --> 00:07:56,499
to treat all these patients,

164
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:59,402
and Seattle Pres is already
closed to trauma.

165
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,911
Hey!

166
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,479
Uh, hello!

167
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:11,781
Everyone... Hey, be quiet!

168
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:15,351
Listen up.

169
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:17,987
We will move all stable patients upstairs

170
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:19,033
to clear beds.

171
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:21,157
We will stock disaster supplies

172
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:22,759
on all floors.

173
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,060
And we will notify the blood bank

174
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:26,429
to have extra units on standby.

175
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:31,067
We are staying open for trauma,
but sheltering in place.

176
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:33,236
This is a brick house,

177
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,545
and no amount of huffing
and puffing can blow us down.

178
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:38,775
Whoo! Whoo!

179
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:46,316
- Yeah, I still got it.
- Okay, come on. Let's go.

180
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,684
- You need something.
- Come to the OR.

181
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:52,666
Did you eat the rest of the chips?

182
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:55,312
Apparently only a third of the
staff can make it into work.

183
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:57,905
Oh, the... the barbecue ones,
the blue bag?

184
00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:00,174
They're sending floor nurses
down to the E.R.

185
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,877
Apparently anesthesia's working triple.

186
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:04,745
Ugh! Where are the chips?

187
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,280
- I ate them last night.
- Oh.

188
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:08,616
I feel like a crappy leader.

189
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,784
I mean, who the hell abandons the ship

190
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:11,659
in the middle of a disaster?

191
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:15,089
Maybe it's not a disaster.

192
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:16,791
We've hardly seen each other
since we got married,

193
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:17,879
and we're stuck here,

194
00:09:17,914 --> 00:09:21,896
so what if we make this
our second honeymoon?

195
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:24,352
With no food?

196
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:28,903
We have jelly and bread and beer and...

197
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:31,906
Expired mac-and-cheese.

198
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:38,478
It's fine, because we have a gas stove.

199
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:42,249
Oh.

200
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:44,585
When's the last time we cooked?

201
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,958
Right there. Trauma one.

202
00:09:50,992 --> 00:09:52,126
- Okay.
- Go, go.

203
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,829
No more trauma rooms. Next incoming
can go to procedure room 4.

204
00:09:54,863 --> 00:09:55,930
Avery needs me in 1. Could you...

205
00:09:55,964 --> 00:09:57,098
Go, go.

206
00:09:57,132 --> 00:09:58,232
Schmitt, I told you trauma 2.

207
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:02,269
Trauma 2's the... the selfie
stick in the brain, and...

208
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:03,337
Helm, you got a problem with brains?

209
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:04,271
- Love brains.
- Trauma 2.

210
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:06,607
Schmitt, go to the clinic with Dr. Kim.

211
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:08,476
We need to clear the patients
per the protocol.

212
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,634
On it.

213
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:13,114
I'm not afraid anymore.
Of the s-selfie stick.

214
00:10:13,148 --> 00:10:14,048
- I can do it.
- Too late.

215
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:16,650
Think about that
on your way to the clinic.

216
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:17,985
- Bailey.
- Altman.

217
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,854
Uh, cardio consult in trauma 1.

218
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:21,650
Oh, I was just about
to ask you for privileges,

219
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:22,857
but now I don't need to.

220
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:24,158
Go.

221
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:26,193
You live here now?

222
00:10:26,228 --> 00:10:29,096
Dr. Ford, 3235. Dr. Ford, 3235.

223
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:30,765
Why did I get a glass door?

224
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,967
Hold tight, Georgia. We got you.

225
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:34,101
Qadri, hand me a 4x4.

226
00:10:34,136 --> 00:10:36,504
Dr. Grey. How was sunny L.A.?

227
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:38,472
Not so sunny.

228
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:39,940
Do you think it violated the fascia?

229
00:10:39,975 --> 00:10:40,908
Uh, not sure.

230
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:44,011
I am worried about
a thoracoabdominal injury.

231
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:46,480
I thought you weren't coming
back until tomorrow night.

232
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,170
Plans changed.

233
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:49,250
Well, if you're home,

234
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:50,480
maybe I won't drink
a whole bottle of wine

235
00:10:50,514 --> 00:10:52,186
and eat a whole carton
of ice cream by myself.

236
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,889
There's fluid
in the upper-right quadrant.

237
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:55,990
Missed the liver.

238
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:58,292
Can you make a fist for me?

239
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:00,394
Now open. That's great.

240
00:11:00,428 --> 00:11:03,831
There's no major damage.
Qadri, clean and stitch.

241
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,441
Good to have you back, Grey.

242
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:08,636
So, you said your plans changed.

243
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,970
Did your VIP patient die?

244
00:11:10,005 --> 00:11:13,207
No, the... just the plans,
they just changed.

245
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:15,743
Qadri, let's get her up to CT, please.

246
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:20,047
I can see it

247
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:21,315
out of the corner of my eye,

248
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:23,050
but I can't feel it.

249
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:24,985
You can't feel it because your brain

250
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,554
doesn't have any pain receptors.

251
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:28,055
I know you're scared, but I need you

252
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:29,757
to stop moving around so much, okay?

253
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,660
I have a selfie stick in my head.

254
00:11:32,694 --> 00:11:36,030
It's not even mine.
It's some idiot teenager's.

255
00:11:36,064 --> 00:11:37,164
How is she talking this much?

256
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,899
Adrenaline, maybe? I don't know.

257
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:40,093
How we doing?

258
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:42,736
I told CT you'd be on your way
any minute.

259
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:44,672
Wh-When are you taking it out?

260
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:46,373
You can take it out, right?

261
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:47,508
Please take it out.

262
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:50,377
Phoebe, I am gonna do
everything I can to remove it,

263
00:11:50,412 --> 00:11:52,680
but when I do,
there is a strong possibility

264
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:54,882
that your brain will bleed or swell.

265
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,070
I just want to prepare you

266
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:58,952
in case you want to call
anyone before surgery.

267
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:01,789
My mom.

268
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:03,290
Can I call my mom?

269
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:05,726
The paramedics said they had my phone.

270
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,134
We'll find it.

271
00:12:10,432 --> 00:12:12,933
Bailey, I need to... I just...

272
00:12:12,968 --> 00:12:14,935
- Oh, go, go.
- Yeah.

273
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:18,806
Do you see yourself?

274
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,142
I told you not
to go outside in that mess!

275
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:24,578
Do you see me? How about some sympathy?

276
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:25,646
And stop shouting!

277
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,882
Nobody can hear themselves think
with you in here.

278
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,783
Can someone please check my ears

279
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:31,218
for years of damage?

280
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:32,653
So, you two are married, then.

281
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:34,154
Decreased breath sounds on the right.

282
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:35,823
He's got a small pneumo.

283
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:37,958
- We were having a fight.
- Which he started.

284
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:40,060
So I went outside to get away from her.

285
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:42,329
Which is all he ever does.

286
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:45,099
And I slammed the front door
on her perfectly.

287
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:48,068
Rivaled the Great Door Slam of 1987.

288
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:52,139
And then someone's mailbox slammed

289
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:53,607
into our sycamore.

290
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:55,276
But I couldn't undo that door slam,

291
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,818
so I took a walk.

292
00:12:57,853 --> 00:12:59,146
Like an idiot.

293
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,115
I can't tell if there's
a pericardial effusion.

294
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,583
I'm getting a pulse in the neck,

295
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:04,118
but I'm worried about
an underlying injury.

296
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:07,121
So, I'm standing in front
of the Hoffmans' house

297
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:11,325
when their stupid Christmas
decorations caught the wind,

298
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:12,693
and, ta-da!

299
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:15,362
I should be in Santa's workshop.

300
00:13:15,397 --> 00:13:16,997
It isn't even Thanksgiving.

301
00:13:17,032 --> 00:13:18,098
It's enraging.

302
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:21,135
I wrote a letter to
the neighborhood association.

303
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:22,269
I write one every year.

304
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:24,220
Hm?

305
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,206
Oh, thank God.

306
00:13:26,241 --> 00:13:27,290
Owen.

307
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:31,178
You two got this?

308
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:32,246
Yeah.

309
00:13:36,384 --> 00:13:37,351
What happened?

310
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:39,019
I'm okay. It barely stings.

311
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:41,388
She walked here from Yesler
and got hit by a tree branch.

312
00:13:41,423 --> 00:13:43,123
So she says. Follow my finger.

313
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:44,291
She needs a few stitches.

314
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:46,193
And a CT scan and a tox screen.

315
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:47,328
I don't need that.

316
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:49,530
It's just gonna say I'm high.

317
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:51,498
I'm sorry.

318
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:54,134
I know I messed up,
but I want to get clean.

319
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,971
I came back because of you
and Owen and Leo.

320
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:03,210
I have to go. I have a surgery. Um...

321
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:04,511
Just tell the nurses she's an addict

322
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:05,713
and don't give her anything.

323
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:09,550
I'm so sorry.

324
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:13,187
Hey, it's gonna be okay, okay?

325
00:14:21,884 --> 00:14:24,896
Come on, come on. Where are you?

326
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,064
What's all that stuff?

327
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,432
Just wedding gifts.

328
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,501
I can't find Bubby!

329
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,270
Is Bubby a security blanket or a pet rat?

330
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,273
There you are!

331
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:38,343
This is Bubby.

332
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,412
She gave me hot meals
when I was living in my car.

333
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,815
I didn't have grandparents.

334
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,351
I can't believe the real answer
is sadder than a pet rat.

335
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,914
Trust me when I say your
mac-and-cheese will be made with love.

336
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,860
- Oh, no.
- What?

337
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,262
What is it?

338
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,765
- Our marriage license.
- So?

339
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,567
So if you don't mail it in,
it's not official!

340
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,269
Was that my job?

341
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,565
Kinda!

342
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,704
So we're not married?

343
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,408
Hello? Yeah.

344
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,076
What's up, Schmitt?

345
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,279
Uh, Dr. Karev,
Josh Gordon's in the clinic

346
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,191
with abdominal pain and vomiting and...

347
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,284
Got it. Will do.

348
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,155
Dr. Karev said to put in an NG
tube and admit him to peds.

349
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,590
I'll take Mrs. Aguilar over,

350
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:26,991
then I'll be back to handle Josh.

351
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,568
- I've got Josh.
- No, no, no.

352
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:30,228
His electrolytes are all over the place,

353
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,462
probably an SBO,

354
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,097
and I have experience with adminis...

355
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah, I know.
You've got all the experience.

356
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,270
You've had a lot more
patients than I've had.

357
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,804
But I've had patients, too,

358
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,074
many with small bowel
obstructions and NG tubes,

359
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,552
so I've got it.

360
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,284
But if you want to help,

361
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:48,479
you can walk him to peds when I'm done.

362
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:54,786
Mommy, I don't want you to be worried.

363
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,096
I'm okay.

364
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,690
It happened on my way to work.

365
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,859
No, work's good.

366
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,195
Helm, we'll keep her
in a sitting position.

367
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:09,334
C-Could you go by my house
later after the storm

368
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,868
and take over for the dog sitter?

369
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,249
I might be a little longer
than I thought.

370
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,476
And don't forget, he only gets
one treat after dinner.

371
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,633
Thanks, Mom.

372
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,218
You're the best.

373
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,355
You're the very best mom.

374
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,691
I'll call you after?

375
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,646
Be safe. Love you.

376
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,366
Sorry, I just...
I don't like to scare her.

377
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,111
We understand.

378
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,137
Ready?

379
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,481
She's plenty scared.

380
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:03,888
- Hey.
- Hey.

381
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,446
Welcome to the North Pole.

382
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,325
Huh. You should've seen
his wife screaming at him

383
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,559
all the way up to the red line.

384
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,827
Marital bliss.

385
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,962
You take him to CT?

386
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,598
No, there were a dozen patients
up ahead of us in line.

387
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,400
I'm thinking we cut the top off

388
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,734
and just pull the cane
out from the bottom.

389
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,062
Works for me.

390
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,339
How's Betty?

391
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,575
Oh, um, she seems to be mostly okay.

392
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,910
- Thank you, by the way.
- Yeah.

393
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,211
Staying means a lot.

394
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,618
Owen, I...

395
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,752
I need to tell you something.

396
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,188
- What?
- Not here... later.

397
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,091
Can we grab a cup of coffee
after surgery?

398
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,926
Uh, sure.

399
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,028
We... We... We need to get in there.

400
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,396
Okay.

401
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,439
- Basin.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

402
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,440
Cottonoid.

403
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,453
And fibrin glue?

404
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:59,077
Yeah, just a little. Good.

405
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,715
- Agh, damn it. Suction.
- What happened?

406
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,817
Stick must have been tamponading
her vertebral artery.

407
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,041
Helm, suction.

408
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,891
He said I don't talk
about my feelings enough,

409
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,660
that I don't share enough.

410
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,395
He should do more surgeries with you.

411
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:19,279
What?

412
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:21,299
Okay, it doesn't look
like it damaged the fascia.

413
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,934
Qadri, do you want to do the honors?

414
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,669
- Pull it out?
- Yes.

415
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:28,506
Straight up. Straight.

416
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,259
Good.

417
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,710
Good.

418
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,948
What, am I just supposed
to change overnight?

419
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,016
Okay, let's wash it out
and start the repair.

420
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,853
Irrigation.

421
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,488
Do you think I'm overreacting?

422
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,323
This woman had 50 pieces of glass in her.

423
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,991
It could have killed her.

424
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,693
You and Jackson, it... it sucks,

425
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,428
but no one's gonna die.

426
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,824
Uh, I was calling for Catherine Fox.

427
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,993
Who is this?

428
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,494
Koracick?

429
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,409
Pulse is dropping, and her
pressure's through the roof.

430
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:39,610
Because she's herniating.

431
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,046
Should we give her mannitol
or start hypertonic saline?

432
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,714
- It won't work.
- What? Why?

433
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,149
Her brain stem is going dark.

434
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,584
Let's check her pupils.

435
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,758
Fixed and dilated.

436
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,161
But she was talking.

437
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,498
She... She talked to us.
She... She talked to her mom.

438
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,706
She was lucid.

439
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:03,668
The stick was right up
against her artery.

440
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,102
Any attempt to remove it was a risk

441
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,399
for hemorrhage
and uncontrollable swelling.

442
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,741
She never had a chance.

443
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,111
No.

444
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,279
Can you check to see if she's a donor?

445
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,581
She is... B negative.

446
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,617
All right, let's, uh, close her up,

447
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,786
get her up to ICU until we can call it.

448
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,187
Helm, let's go.

449
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,722
B negative?

450
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,057
Yes, why?

451
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,192
That matches Cece Colvin.

452
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,272
What are you doing?
There's no more patients.

453
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,807
Just making sure you get back okay.

454
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:43,808
Ready?

455
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,776
Don't worry about me.

456
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,144
I'm waiting it out over here,

457
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,146
and not because I'm scared or weak

458
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,882
but because it's
the sensible thing to do.

459
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,149
The winds are picking up.

460
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,285
Listen, I'm sorry

461
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,720
if I came off harsh in the elevator.

462
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,455
You were an ass.

463
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:01,626
This... This is exactly
what I didn't want.

464
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,140
I don't need the drama,
the... the hurt feelings,

465
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:05,663
the freshly coming out.

466
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,791
I don't need the shame spiral.

467
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,668
Look, you're really sweet,

468
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,970
but I can't guide you out of the closet

469
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,972
like some kind of gay Sherpa, all right?

470
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,508
I'm not the drama. You're the drama.

471
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:20,244
And you're also clueless
if you think it's safe

472
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,913
to cross the ambulance bay right now.

473
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,614
Ever heard of the Venturi effect,

474
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,349
Mr. "I'm So Experienced"?

475
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,784
It means wind speeds

476
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,786
can easily double
in between two buildings,

477
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,921
creating a tunnel.

478
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,623
There's a reason they call
Pacific Northwest windstorms

479
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:33,798
"Big Blows."

480
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:35,860
This is an extra Big Blow!

481
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:38,763
See, I-I can't even touch that.

482
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,700
At least stay low to the ground.

483
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,439
Nico!

484
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:55,924
Nico!

485
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:08,603
Nico!

486
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:19,781
Hurry! In there!

487
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:34,662
Are you okay?

488
00:22:34,697 --> 00:22:36,765
Yeah, I think so.

489
00:22:39,802 --> 00:22:42,137
Ohh! That was...

490
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:44,272
Dude.

491
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:46,341
You're welcome.

492
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,849
Okay, ready? Here we go.

493
00:22:54,884 --> 00:22:56,384
All right, keep going.

494
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:58,853
There's no injury to the jugular so far.

495
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:00,522
Are you even pulling on it?

496
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:02,390
Listen, slow and steady.

497
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:03,425
I don't want him to bleed out.

498
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:05,360
We're buying him some time
away from his wife.

499
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:07,328
We might be doing him a favor.

500
00:23:10,366 --> 00:23:12,133
So, did something happen, something bad?

501
00:23:12,168 --> 00:23:13,368
Not now.

502
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:15,419
Carotid's intact.

503
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:19,507
Listen, if you're sick or
something, you should just...

504
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:20,672
Owen.

505
00:23:21,952 --> 00:23:23,344
Wait.

506
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:25,246
Is this, whatever this is,

507
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:27,215
why you came back to Seattle
in the first place?

508
00:23:27,249 --> 00:23:28,917
Why didn't you talk to me before now?

509
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:32,687
Well, 'cause I didn't want
anyone to... bleed out.

510
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:34,589
Oh, so it's definitely bad.

511
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:36,257
Can we just focus on the surgery?

512
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:38,693
Great. My field's clear.

513
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:53,875
I'm officially declaring her.

514
00:23:55,544 --> 00:23:58,680
Her radionuclide scan shows
no cerebral perfusion.

515
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,683
She's brain dead.

516
00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:05,620
I'll touch base with UNOS
and our transplant coordinator.

517
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,722
- Helm, you'll...
- Tell Dr. Grey?

518
00:24:07,756 --> 00:24:09,624
Yes, right away.

519
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:23,605
Hello?

520
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:25,139
Honey, is that you?

521
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:26,907
Are you out?

522
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:29,811
Mrs. Moss, um...

523
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:33,330
This is Dr. Shepherd.

524
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:35,783
I was your daughter's surgeon.

525
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:45,960
Just go ahead and yell, okay?

526
00:24:45,995 --> 00:24:48,129
I know you're mad, and I get it, so...

527
00:24:48,163 --> 00:24:49,731
Thank you.

528
00:24:49,765 --> 00:24:51,640
For coming back.

529
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:54,435
You can always come back, okay?

530
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:57,272
Please, always come back.

531
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:00,508
Okay.

532
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:20,194
What is so wrong in your life

533
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:22,297
that you can't listen to my problems?

534
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:23,331
Maggie.

535
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:25,033
No.

536
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,968
Did Jackson tell you what happened?

537
00:25:27,002 --> 00:25:28,369
Because even if he did,
that shouldn't matter.

538
00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:29,804
You're my sister.
You should have my back.

539
00:25:29,838 --> 00:25:31,839
Do you love him? Do you still love him?

540
00:25:31,874 --> 00:25:33,841
Yeah, of course,
but that's not the point.

541
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:35,043
No, it is the point!

542
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:42,784
Catherine has advanced
chondrosarcoma on her spine.

543
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:47,689
She's my VIP patient.
She's why I went to Los Angeles.

544
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:55,463
It's big, and it's bad,
and he's gonna need you.

545
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:58,199
So, unless he's revealed himself
to be some sort of sociopath,

546
00:25:58,233 --> 00:25:59,834
just make up with him,

547
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:01,536
or, at the very least, be his friend.

548
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,037
Does Jackson know? Does Richard?

549
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:04,739
Not yet.

550
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:06,674
- Meredith.
- I know.

551
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:10,478
And you broke HIPAA to me
with Teddy, so we're even.

552
00:26:12,014 --> 00:26:14,083
I, uh... I found them. He didn't.

553
00:26:14,117 --> 00:26:15,216
Found what?

554
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,552
We may have organs for Cece.

555
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,060
Okay.

556
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:29,030
Okay.

557
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:37,271
Grazed the liver, missed the colon.

558
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:39,707
I don't see any damage to the spleen.

559
00:26:39,742 --> 00:26:40,775
How's the heart?

560
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:44,078
Well, the cane passed anterior
to the pericardium.

561
00:26:44,113 --> 00:26:47,348
There's only a small hole
in the diaphragm,

562
00:26:47,383 --> 00:26:49,617
and it missed the heart completely.

563
00:26:49,652 --> 00:26:53,354
Yeah, and the bowel only has
a few serosal tears.

564
00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:55,957
- Irrigation?
- Yeah, I can't believe it.

565
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:57,925
He's completely unscathed.

566
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,427
Honestly, I'm kind of disappointed.

567
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:05,933
- Owen.
- Hmm?

568
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:10,271
I'm pregnant.

569
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:13,532
With your baby.

570
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,784
I'm sorry I waited so long.

571
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:19,978
Dr. Altman, they're asking
for you in the E.R.

572
00:27:20,003 --> 00:27:21,916
- Another cardiac case.
- Yeah.

573
00:27:23,285 --> 00:27:24,485
I'm on my way.

574
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,323
Congratulations?

575
00:27:42,024 --> 00:27:44,292
Teddy, are you and Owen finished?

576
00:27:47,096 --> 00:27:48,663
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

577
00:27:48,697 --> 00:27:50,231
With your surgery.

578
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:52,467
Oh, um, they were just about to close,

579
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:54,068
and... and then I got called out.

580
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:56,437
Okay, thanks. I, uh, have to talk to him.

581
00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:58,606
And, um, thank you so much for your help.

582
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:00,241
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate it.

583
00:28:00,276 --> 00:28:01,476
Oh, yeah, of course.

584
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,977
- Hey, Altman!
- Excuse me.

585
00:28:03,012 --> 00:28:04,512
- Yeah?
- Help me out.

586
00:28:04,547 --> 00:28:05,580
Wow.

587
00:28:05,614 --> 00:28:06,681
Where are all the orderlies?

588
00:28:06,715 --> 00:28:09,417
They're stretched thin,
so maintenance is helping out.

589
00:28:09,451 --> 00:28:10,852
This entire hospital is stretched thin.

590
00:28:10,886 --> 00:28:12,687
You should shut it down
before someone gets hurt.

591
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:14,489
- What? You want her to close trauma?
- Yeah, I do.

592
00:28:14,523 --> 00:28:16,591
Every hospital in the area
is shut down, and...

593
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:17,625
And this is a brick house.

594
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,761
- Get him to CT.
- Got it.

595
00:28:21,897 --> 00:28:23,631
You know, for what it's worth,

596
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:25,433
I was the last one
to find out about Harriet,

597
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:27,368
and she's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

598
00:28:27,403 --> 00:28:28,970
Could you...
Uh, do you mind talking to...?

599
00:28:29,004 --> 00:28:31,806
Go ahead. Go. I'll talk to his wife.

600
00:28:35,244 --> 00:28:38,780
So I can get my transplants today?

601
00:28:38,814 --> 00:28:41,616
Yeah, there's a few more tests
that Dr. Pierce has to run,

602
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,284
but if they check out, yes.

603
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:45,720
Who's the donor? Do they have family?

604
00:28:45,754 --> 00:28:47,722
All I can say is that it was someone

605
00:28:47,756 --> 00:28:49,294
who was hurt in the storm.

606
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:50,506
And the storm's gotten so bad

607
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:52,229
that UNOS can't
physically send the organs

608
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:53,328
anywhere else.

609
00:28:53,362 --> 00:28:55,530
So they're giving them to me?

610
00:28:55,564 --> 00:28:57,260
Why the face?

611
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:01,235
You weren't the next person
on the list, Cece.

612
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,338
You were nowhere near the top

613
00:29:03,372 --> 00:29:05,807
because your body's been
through so much damage,

614
00:29:05,841 --> 00:29:07,542
and with procedures like these,

615
00:29:07,576 --> 00:29:10,078
you're at risk for catastrophic bleeding.

616
00:29:10,112 --> 00:29:11,713
You'll be under anesthesia for hours,

617
00:29:11,747 --> 00:29:13,147
which can only increase the possibility

618
00:29:13,182 --> 00:29:15,583
that you'll clot or have a stroke.

619
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:17,251
There's a chance it won't work.

620
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:20,254
There's a chance you might not
make it off Dr. Grey's table.

621
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:22,757
What's wrong with this one, again?

622
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:24,559
He's right.

623
00:29:24,593 --> 00:29:26,694
You don't have to accept the organs.

624
00:29:26,729 --> 00:29:28,563
We are taking a huge risk.

625
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:30,932
If I die today, I die fighting.

626
00:29:30,966 --> 00:29:34,176
I'll die knowing
I did everything I could,

627
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,537
but, Dr. Grey, if you don't fight,

628
00:29:36,572 --> 00:29:39,607
if you don't try,
if you don't do your part

629
00:29:39,642 --> 00:29:44,612
and squeeze all the light
and love and joy you can

630
00:29:44,647 --> 00:29:48,019
out of this one life you've been given,

631
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:50,558
I'm gonna haunt you from my grave.

632
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,183
Okay.

633
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,175
Okay.

634
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,391
Now give me those organs.

635
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:59,761
Because I'd much rather
haunt you from above ground.

636
00:30:01,764 --> 00:30:03,731
I will see you upstairs, Cece.

637
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:12,240
Okay, so, let's recheck her potassium

638
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:14,042
and correct her coagulopathy, okay?

639
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,915
- Yes.
- Uh, yes to...?

640
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:23,451
Drinks. I'm assuming
the offer's still standing?

641
00:30:23,486 --> 00:30:24,593
- Really?
- Yeah.

642
00:30:24,627 --> 00:30:25,791
Definitely.

643
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:27,919
- Um, you want to try tonight?
- Sure.

644
00:30:27,954 --> 00:30:29,624
I mean, if the bar's still
standing after the storm.

645
00:30:29,658 --> 00:30:31,659
Let's do it.

646
00:30:41,637 --> 00:30:43,805
Someone who knows us
thought we'd want this?

647
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,440
Kepner registered for us.

648
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:48,576
Wait, what is the point
of the tiny bowls?

649
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,678
Oh, those are ramekins.

650
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:53,347
They're, like, uh, good
for crème brûlée and stuff.

651
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:55,850
Mm, who are you?

652
00:30:55,884 --> 00:30:58,286
Izzie... Izzie, she baked a lot.

653
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,340
You know what I'm thinking?

654
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:01,155
We shouldn't talk about our exes

655
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,237
on our honeymoon?

656
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:04,325
No. Mm, we return all this crap,

657
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:07,028
make a fortune, buy a bigger TV.

658
00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:11,599
I love you.

659
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:13,735
I love you.

660
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,814
For your face.

661
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:28,870
There's some swelling.

662
00:31:30,586 --> 00:31:31,853
What?

663
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:32,920
What happened to your glasses?

664
00:31:32,955 --> 00:31:35,156
The band snapped when we were
climbing in the rig.

665
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,657
Can you see?

666
00:31:36,692 --> 00:31:38,559
Yes, I can see.

667
00:31:38,594 --> 00:31:40,799
Just not perfectly.

668
00:31:41,697 --> 00:31:44,465
They're probably broken on the ground

669
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,200
or blew away into a tree,

670
00:31:46,235 --> 00:31:47,889
which is all your fault.

671
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,308
You done?

672
00:31:50,873 --> 00:31:52,106
Yes.

673
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:56,210
No. No, I'm not done.

674
00:31:56,245 --> 00:31:58,146
You know what's also your fault?

675
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,047
The fact that you think
I have a shame spiral,

676
00:32:00,082 --> 00:32:01,582
because I don't.

677
00:32:01,617 --> 00:32:03,851
I'm not spiraling. I'm a nerd.

678
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:05,987
I'm no more ashamed
of being attracted to guys

679
00:32:06,021 --> 00:32:08,356
than I am of anything else in my life.

680
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:12,894
Do you know what I did almost every night

681
00:32:12,928 --> 00:32:14,624
before I went to college?

682
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:19,200
I sat in my mom's basement

683
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:21,769
with three other debate-club kids

684
00:32:21,804 --> 00:32:23,871
playing "Dungeons & Dragons,"

685
00:32:23,906 --> 00:32:27,875
a-and it's the same basement
I live in now.

686
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:32,580
Trust me when I say
no one was having sex.

687
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:34,248
With guys or girls.

688
00:32:34,283 --> 00:32:35,583
Sex was...

689
00:32:36,785 --> 00:32:38,953
Sex was like the Sunsword.

690
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:44,125
It's a magical weapon in the game

691
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,693
that's really hard to find.

692
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:48,796
It's basically like a talking
light saber, but...

693
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:50,798
Never mind, doesn't matter.

694
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,495
The point is...

695
00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:55,832
sex wasn't on the table for us.

696
00:32:56,238 --> 00:32:59,874
So I didn't know I was gay.

697
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:03,611
I-I knew that I had feelings for boys,

698
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:05,079
but I didn't understand it.

699
00:33:07,816 --> 00:33:09,584
Not until you kissed me.

700
00:33:09,618 --> 00:33:11,953
You kissed me,

701
00:33:11,987 --> 00:33:15,122
and I felt the opposite of shame.

702
00:33:15,157 --> 00:33:19,314
I felt like I existed,

703
00:33:19,795 --> 00:33:21,896
and everything fell in place.

704
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,798
For the first time, it felt like

705
00:33:23,832 --> 00:33:26,934
I was holding the Sunsword, and I kno...

706
00:33:28,871 --> 00:33:31,005
Are... Are... Are...
Are you just kissing me

707
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,007
to get me to stop talking?

708
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,075
No.

709
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:51,259
Hey.

710
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:52,660
Look, I know...

711
00:33:52,694 --> 00:33:54,081
...I probably shouldn't have
said all that to Cece,

712
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:56,530
and I-I get it if you're mad,
but I-I had to say...

713
00:33:56,565 --> 00:33:57,999
It was brave.

714
00:33:58,033 --> 00:33:59,667
Not many doctors are brave enough

715
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:01,314
to tell that kind of truth.

716
00:34:02,004 --> 00:34:04,338
You impress me, DeLuca.

717
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:06,694
Well, you amaze me, Dr. Grey.

718
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:09,072
And while I'm feeling brave,

719
00:34:10,012 --> 00:34:11,145
I'm not sorry I kissed you
at the wedding.

720
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,381
'Cause it's all I've been able
to think about ever since,

721
00:34:13,415 --> 00:34:15,716
and I know you have options,

722
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:19,306
but... I want you to know
that I'm one of them.

723
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:21,522
I am your attending.

724
00:34:21,556 --> 00:34:22,957
No, no, no. Don't do that, okay?

725
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:24,892
This isn't some kind of abuse of power.

726
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:27,228
I'm not an intern. I'm a senior resident.

727
00:34:27,262 --> 00:34:28,262
You dated my sister.

728
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:31,799
Maggie doesn't care.
Like, deeply doesn't care.

729
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:33,467
DeLuca.

730
00:34:33,502 --> 00:34:35,223
Meredith.

731
00:34:36,104 --> 00:34:37,805
Andrew.

732
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,740
Look...

733
00:34:39,775 --> 00:34:40,942
...I think there's something here,

734
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:43,911
and we can keep going through
all the excuses of why not,

735
00:34:43,946 --> 00:34:46,881
but I think you feel it, too.

736
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:50,989
I'm having such a week.

737
00:34:51,954 --> 00:34:53,950
I don't trust my thinking.

738
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:57,078
So I'm gonna walk out of here, okay?

739
00:34:57,926 --> 00:35:00,094
But I'm gonna think
about what you said...

740
00:35:00,128 --> 00:35:02,208
when I'm able to think.

741
00:35:03,432 --> 00:35:04,665
Okay?

742
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,045
Okay.

743
00:35:06,935 --> 00:35:08,069
Okay.

744
00:35:15,712 --> 00:35:17,840
Cheers. To our second honeymoon.

745
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,058
Cheers.

746
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,468
Mmm.

747
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:23,303
Ahh. Beer tastes better in this.

748
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:24,441
If we keep all the gifts,

749
00:35:24,475 --> 00:35:26,206
does that mean we have
to write thank-you notes?

750
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
- Not it.
- Not it.

751
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,812
I don't care about the license.
I feel married.

752
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,616
Me, too.

753
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:37,217
But we should still mail it in.

754
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:38,818
Yeah.

755
00:35:43,691 --> 00:35:45,325
Louie's fine?

756
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,828
He... He was an appetizer
on a festive toothpick.

757
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:51,531
Yes, and, surprisingly,
nothing vital was pierced.

758
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:53,700
- Ohh.
- He needs to rest, okay?

759
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,136
Stay quiet for several weeks or so.

760
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:02,008
I know it sounds like we hate
each other, the way we go at it,

761
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:05,478
but I have loved him every day

762
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:09,182
of the 45 years we've been together.

763
00:36:09,216 --> 00:36:13,186
But still, that's 45 years of marriage.

764
00:36:13,613 --> 00:36:17,257
I mean, we would have never
made it without fighting.

765
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:20,393
Louie... he likes a dramatic exit,

766
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,563
but he scared me half to death today,

767
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:25,665
because...

768
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,033
...because, you see,

769
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:29,102
he always comes back.

770
00:36:29,136 --> 00:36:35,075
No matter the fight,
he would... he would come back.

771
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,443
Thank you.

772
00:36:36,477 --> 00:36:38,211
Mm-hmm.

773
00:37:01,068 --> 00:37:02,902
I am gonna re-read this entire thing,

774
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:04,771
and then I'm gonna get a new sponsor.

775
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,380
Well, I think that is an excellent idea.

776
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:09,642
'Cause I'm pretty sure

777
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:12,879
my wife is having an affair
with Tom Koracick,

778
00:37:12,913 --> 00:37:16,282
and I'm afraid, if I don't
get a little more serenity

779
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,751
than I already have right now,

780
00:37:17,785 --> 00:37:19,619
that I'll kill someone

781
00:37:19,653 --> 00:37:21,988
and go back to jail for good.

782
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:23,990
Catherine and Koracick?

783
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:26,519
Well, not everyone is Bailey and Warren.

784
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:29,596
Ben and I...

785
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,817
aren't sleeping
in the same house right now.

786
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:36,503
I asked for a sabbatical.

787
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:39,806
You don't take a sabbatical
from a marriage.

788
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,574
You take it from a job.

789
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:44,477
I worry every minute of the day

790
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:50,650
about whether he was suffocating
from too much carbon monoxide,

791
00:37:50,684 --> 00:37:52,585
blowing up in a burning building,

792
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,821
or falling off a stupid ladder.

793
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:59,325
I worried about him dying.

794
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,514
A-And all that stopped just
because you asked him to leave?

795
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:06,476
And you're not worried anymore?

796
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:10,670
You gave up your job and your husband.

797
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:12,266
What's next... Tuck?

798
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,275
Bailey, you're trying to fix
the inside from the outside,

799
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:19,679
and I know because
my insides are a damn mess.

800
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:22,649
You need to get some help, Bailey.

801
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,989
Hi.

802
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:31,324
You got a minute?

803
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,464
Been thinking about yesterday.

804
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,636
That was kind of the first big
fight we've ever really had.

805
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,187
Jackson, I-I don't know how to say this.

806
00:39:01,222 --> 00:39:03,323
- No, it's okay.
- You don't have to say anything.

807
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:09,914
Maggie.

808
00:39:16,704 --> 00:39:18,738
Jackson, I'm so sorry.

809
00:39:21,548 --> 00:39:22,575
It's your mom.

810
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:34,954
- Hey, Helm.
- Hey.

811
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:37,190
You're taking Phoebe up
for the procurement?

812
00:39:37,224 --> 00:39:39,626
Yes. Uh, Dr. Grey's meeting us in O.R. 2

813
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,094
while Qadri preps Cece.

814
00:39:42,763 --> 00:39:44,697
I'm joining. Thanks.

815
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,705
- Hey.
- No!

816
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,873
What? I'm... I'm going to the O.R.

817
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:54,774
You're following me.

818
00:39:54,808 --> 00:39:57,076
I'm going to your O.R. I'm on the case.

819
00:39:57,111 --> 00:39:59,946
Okay, uh, I will stand over here,

820
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,983
and I will be silent,
and I won't look at you.

821
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:08,721
Coming in, careful.

822
00:40:08,756 --> 00:40:10,657
Go. Go, go, go.

823
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:12,058
- Hey.
- Watch it.

824
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:13,326
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

825
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,612
Teddy, we need to...

826
00:40:16,646 --> 00:40:18,298
Owen, I'm... I'm heading back
into the O.R.

827
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,666
I got this.

828
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,135
Hey, we got this.

829
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,175
How could you have kept this from me?

830
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:30,543
Don't act like this should've been easy.

831
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,447
Hey!

832
00:40:34,481 --> 00:40:36,282
I have been looking for you everywhere

833
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:40,086
because I had to see you
and tell you that, um...

834
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,755
whoa... um, that I want to apply

835
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,924
to be Betty's official foster mom,

836
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:47,460
which might mean that Betty and
I have to move out for a while

837
00:40:47,494 --> 00:40:51,698
for bureaucratic whatever,
but, um... I love her.

838
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:54,600
You know? Like, we love her, right?

839
00:40:54,635 --> 00:40:58,544
Oh, take me down

840
00:40:58,578 --> 00:41:02,141
What? Did something happen?

841
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:06,279
Sometimes our body's signals
get messed up...

842
00:41:10,818 --> 00:41:12,819
...and our failsafe goes haywire.

843
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:20,893
Instead of making clots,
our body destroys them.

844
00:41:20,928 --> 00:41:22,695
- What is it?
- Amelia, I need to...

845
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,464
We need to...

846
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:30,169
And the thing that's supposed to help us

847
00:41:30,204 --> 00:41:31,637
only hurts us.

848
00:41:31,672 --> 00:41:33,072
Oh!

849
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,576
What's happening?

850
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,422
We're stuck.

851
00:41:49,456 --> 00:41:50,857
It means we start to bleed...

852
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,441
...and everything shuts down.

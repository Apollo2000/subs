1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:04,505
Just like we need food
and water, humans need each other.

2
00:00:11,623 --> 00:00:12,756
Do I know you?

3
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,792
No.

4
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:16,961
Is that a deal-breaker?

5
00:00:16,995 --> 00:00:18,629
Really, Meredith?

6
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:20,164
This is kind of a lot.

7
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:21,298
Don't you think?

8
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,666
Stop judging me.

9
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:24,201
I really can't.

10
00:00:24,236 --> 00:00:27,037
I can't.

11
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:32,142
Oh.

12
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:34,945
A brain study revealed that,
when placed in an MRI,

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,881
a patient's reward center lit up

14
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:39,383
when another person sat in the room.

15
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:46,190
Neurons fire when we talk to
someone, think about someone,

16
00:00:46,224 --> 00:00:48,893
and they go haywire
when we hold someone's hand.

17
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:50,461
Come on. Come on.

18
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:52,496
Shake, shake

19
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:55,911
- Ugh.

20
00:00:55,945 --> 00:00:57,134
- Nope.
- Hmm?

21
00:00:57,168 --> 00:00:59,003
- Kids live here now.
- Oh.

22
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:00,304
Oh, okay, bedroom, bedroom.

23
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:01,347
Okay. Good idea.

24
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:03,837
Betty's still awake.

25
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:04,842
Oh.

26
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:07,044
Oh, and so is Leo.

27
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:08,145
Okay, I'll just, uh...

28
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:10,314
Our brains and bodies
are actually programmed

29
00:01:10,348 --> 00:01:12,216
to seek each other out and connect.

30
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,418
Whoo!

31
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:17,354
So, then why do so many people
prefer being alone?

32
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:19,590
Have you been home all night?

33
00:01:19,624 --> 00:01:21,273
I just got here.

34
00:01:22,146 --> 00:01:24,580
Do you dream vividly?

35
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:27,073
Like, so vivid, you can feel
how the dream felt

36
00:01:27,098 --> 00:01:28,932
in your whole body?

37
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:30,067
What's with all the milk?

38
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:32,284
I almost slept with Owen.

39
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:35,272
- So, you bought milk?
- No.

40
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:37,107
The baby woke up, it was awkward,

41
00:01:37,142 --> 00:01:38,909
so I came over here to get clothes.

42
00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:40,177
Why is everyone awake?

43
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:41,111
Uh...

44
00:01:41,146 --> 00:01:42,246
Jackson proposed.

45
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,515
- With milk?
- Wait, what?

46
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,917
Or half-proposed.

47
00:01:46,952 --> 00:01:48,552
He was not not talking about marriage.

48
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:51,956
- Is he competing with April?
- I kind of get that.

49
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,357
What did you say?

50
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:57,227
I said that, um,
I had to go get some milk.

51
00:01:57,262 --> 00:01:58,417
And what did he say?

52
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,531
I don't know. I left to get the milk.

53
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:02,874
You know, he probably
doesn't really believe

54
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:03,974
that you needed it.

55
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,582
I had to get it, Meredith.

56
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:07,871
Okay, well, why don't you
just tell Jackson

57
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:09,239
that you're not ready?

58
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:11,275
No.

59
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:12,943
- You are ready?
- No!

60
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:15,212
No, we haven't even said
"I love you" yet.

61
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:17,247
It is too soon. It...

62
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:19,283
It's like you and Owen playing house.

63
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:22,086
Like insta-family,
like you just get a cup of soup,

64
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,321
add some water, and bam, family.

65
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:25,796
At least until...

66
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:27,958
Until what?

67
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:32,129
We need toilet paper.

68

69
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:46,136
Hey, I'm not entirely sure why you left,

70
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:47,177
but I'm back at the hospital.

71
00:02:47,212 --> 00:02:49,446
My patient spiked a post-op fever.

72
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:51,248
So, call me back, okay?

73
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:52,540
Is she okay?

74
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:54,351
Just lay back, Ms. Colvin. Try to relax.

75
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:56,020
She's been in and out since you
left, and her blood pressure's dropping.

76
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:58,822
All right. Let's get a sepsis work-up,
a chest X-ray, and some cultures.

77
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:00,096
Blood and urine is already done.

78
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:02,326
Hey, Nisha, I'm gonna check out
your back, all right?

79
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,780
It might sting a little bit.

80
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:05,796
Nisha, how you feeling?

81
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,831
I don't know. How am I feeling?

82
00:03:07,866 --> 00:03:09,102
You got a bit of an infection back here,

83
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:11,702
but I'm gonna change up
your antibiotics, okay?

84
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:14,805
You can do whatever you want to me.

85
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,640
See? I flirted!

86
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:18,042
Excellent work.

87
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:21,178
A little aggressive,
but once the drugs wear off,

88
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:23,020
we'll work on the nuance.

89
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:27,351
She's in V-Tach! Pull in the crash cart!

90
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:28,652
What's happening?

91
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:30,621
Paddles. Sync charge to 100.

92
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:33,624
All right, here we go.

93
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:34,823
We got you.

94
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:38,562
Clear!

95
00:03:38,596 --> 00:03:39,630
Still V-Tach.

96
00:03:39,664 --> 00:03:40,631
Help her, please!

97
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:41,665
120.

98
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:42,667
Clear.

99
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,834
Help her! You have to do something!

100
00:03:43,868 --> 00:03:45,202
200. Clear.

101
00:03:48,907 --> 00:03:50,541
What... What happened?

102
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:52,342
Dr. Avery, her heart rate's climbing.

103
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:53,510
Ah, it's gonna be a long night.

104
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:54,645
Here we go.

Victoria Fisher, return to Admitting.

107
00:04:10,528 --> 00:04:13,297
Victoria Fisher, return to Admitting.

108
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,656
Okay.

109
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:19,156
Whoa.

110
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,405
It's like a spa, but on the moon.

111
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,342
Just, uh, put on some
smooth jazz and some slippers,

112
00:04:25,376 --> 00:04:26,944
light some candles, and, uh...

113
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:28,612
And you'd blow yourself up.

114
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:30,347
See, when these doors are closed,

115
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:33,350
it pressurizes the room
up to three atmospheres.

116
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:37,387
It will radically decrease healing time.

117
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:39,389
This is a world-class hyperbaric chamber.

118
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:41,225
Yeah, no, I know.

119
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:43,026
But moon spa sounds better.

120
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:44,595
Oh, hey, uh,

121
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:46,630
I've got some requisitions
that need approval.

122
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:48,065
Does that go through you, or...

123
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:49,444
You choose an interim chief yet?

124
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:50,534
Almost.

125
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:54,238
Just going over
a few final considerations.

126
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:55,572
Yeah, it's a tough decision.

127
00:04:55,607 --> 00:04:58,775
I mean, you want somebody good,
but not better than you, right?

128
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,923
Like a solid substitute player,
maybe plays half the game.

129
00:05:01,957 --> 00:05:03,347
I'm sorry?

130
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:05,649
You want a third-,
maybe fourth-round draft pack

131
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:08,051
so your people really miss you
when you're gone.

132
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:09,753
I mean, we all know what happens
when LeBron's on the bench, right?

133
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:13,712
The crowd goes wild... "MVP, MVP, MV..."

134
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,459
You're LeBron.
They want you back on the court

135
00:05:15,493 --> 00:05:17,661
as soon as possible.

136
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,463
Not into basketball?

137
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:21,965
Okay, uh, enjoy your moon spa.

138
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:29,573
Hey. You paged me to the breezeway.

139
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:32,109
- I wanted to see you, and...
- Whoa.

140
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:35,579
How was this morning?

141
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:38,482
Uh, Leo slept in,
and Betty made breakfast.

142
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:40,751
It was fine. She was asking for you.

143
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:42,085
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

144
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:47,357
We need help, please!

145
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:49,326
- Are you hurt?
- They are! They're in the back!

146
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,334
- Who?
- Our stupid parents.

147
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:54,831
He was bleeding a lot.

148
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:56,967
I used the whole roll of paper towels.

149
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:58,335
Uh, we need a gurney, now!

150
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:00,337
Two. My mom was also on the motorcycle.

151
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:02,139
Honey, did you put the van's
emergency brake on?

152
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:03,707
Yes, I'm not an idiot like you and Dad

153
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,475
who just crashed a death machine!

154
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,344
We were trying to avoid hitting the dog!

155
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:09,313
And please don't yell at me.
I'm your mother.

156
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:11,155
- You're not acting like it!
- He wasn't wearing a helmet?

157
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,581
We only had one. He made me wear it.

158
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:14,618
We were just going around the block!

159
00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:16,119

00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,018
Uh, exactly. I mean, she went
into V-Tach at least four times

167
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:49,052
in the middle of the night.

168
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,888
And until the dialysis
restores her electrolytes,

169
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:53,991
she's at risk for arrhythmias.

170
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,926
We could start her on an amiodarone drip.

171
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,561
All right, well let's keep that as a plan

172
00:06:57,595 --> 00:06:59,754
and just keep rechecking her potassium.

173
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:00,831
And how's Nisha?

174
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:02,699
She's septic, white count of 22,000,

175
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:04,544
and we started her on pressors.

176
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:06,245
Her parents are on a flight back
from Tokyo now,

177
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,850
but until they get here,
Cece won't leave her side.

178
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:13,186
So, let's make sure that she
wears a mask and gloves.

179
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,711
Yeah. Send for an ABG
and, uh, lactic acid.

180
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,058
Thanks for keeping an eye on her.

181
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:21,894
She's a very sweet woman, but
she's so aggressive with the...

182
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:22,988
- The matchmaking?
- Yes.

183
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:24,059
Right? Yeah, no kidding.

184
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:25,598
She asked me about my status,
my relationship history,

185
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:27,333
my 10-year plan.

186
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:29,235
Career- and relationship-wise.

187
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:30,570
That's why I can't go back in there.

188
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:32,004
At least you can tell her to back off

189
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,172
because you have Maggie.

190
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:35,274
Yeah, but you should just tell
her you have work, you know?

191
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:36,320
And what does that mean?

192
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:37,996
Like, that you're married to your work.

193
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,078
I mean...

194
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:40,181
But I'm not.

195
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:43,416
Oh, come on. We all are.
Just you are especially.

196
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,682
Excuse me?

197
00:07:45,723 --> 00:07:47,854
Have you seen the, uh,
hyperbaric chamber?

198
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:50,089
That thing is finished,
so it's probably worth

199
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:51,357
taking a little peek.

200
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:54,927
You're very successful.

201
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:56,462
Oh, very. Very successful.

202
00:07:56,497 --> 00:07:58,898
Yeah, but I'm not married...

203
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:00,142
That's cool.

204
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:01,267
Me neither.

205
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,923
Oh, hi.

206
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,582
Um, may I remind you

207
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:15,386
that many people still
call me "Chief" out of habit?

208
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,455
I mean, I can ensure
a seamless transition...

209
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:19,790
It's not going to be you.

210
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:21,125
Wait, why on Earth not?

211
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:22,610
Because...

212
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:24,795
One day, I want the job back,

213
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,964
and you're a first-round draft pack,

214
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:29,267
and no one removes
a game starter from the court...

215
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,935
I mean office.

216
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,838
Since when do you like sports?

217
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:41,145
- Where are you going?
- To the moon spa.

218
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,580
Where it's quiet.

219
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,115
Her creatinine keeps climbing,

220
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:51,455
so let's order an ultrasound
with contrast and a cardiac MRI.

221
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,291
I just want to make sure
her tanking kidneys

222
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,518
aren't tanking her heart.

223
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:57,962
I, uh...

224
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,964
I understand why you don't want
to go in there.

225
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,466
I mean, I'm married
to general surgery, too.

226
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,302
I get it. I relate.

227
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,970
Helm, no.

228
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,606
I... It's... Just...
Go get the MRI, please.

229
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,207
Oh, Meredith! There she is.

230
00:09:10,242 --> 00:09:11,276
Can we talk?

231
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,322
What happened to the honeymoon?

232
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:13,435
What happened to your face?

233
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,512
I forgot sunscreen.

234
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:16,347
And I want to save the world.

235
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:18,151
- Oh.
- Come on.

236
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,654
What do you think?

237
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:27,592
I think...

238
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,252
Alex married up.

239
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:31,329
Right? If she does this, I can retire

240
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,064
and buy a bigger boat than Avery.

241
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:34,699
And also save lives.

242
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,867
And this would work
for all types of cancers?

243
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:39,737
Leukemias, adenocarcinomas,
liver hepatomas?

244
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:40,898
Maybe? I don't know!

245
00:09:40,932 --> 00:09:43,007
But if we can isolate the cancer cells

246
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,251
and locate the gene sequence

247
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:45,910
that makes them grow uncontrollably,

248
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:47,912
then, theoretically,

249
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:50,815
we can make the anti-DNA
sequence that'll stop it.

250
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:52,249
Well, then you could use it for anything

251
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:53,584
that goes wrong in the body.

252
00:09:53,619 --> 00:09:54,518
Exactly.

253
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,553
Well, now I'm pissed

254
00:09:55,587 --> 00:09:57,154
because you came back early
from your honeymoon

255
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:59,156
to wave the future of medicine in my face

256
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:01,192
and take it to Boston?

257
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,261
I came back to ask you to create
a fellowship for me.

258
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:06,530
So that I can keep working
on mini livers and this.

259
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,699
Mostly this.

260
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,167
With you.

261
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:12,336
Give me an hour to get approval
from Bailey.

262
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,379
So, you were lucky.

263
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:20,711
You may have gotten away
with a few bruises

264
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:21,746
and cuts on your hands.

265
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,880
I'm so sorry.

266
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,882
Don't apologize. This is my job.

267
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,250
No, I'm so embarrassed.

268
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:28,719
We decided to take a ride,
just around the block.

269
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,388
Doug bought the bike a few weeks ago.

270
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,622
He works in HR, and frankly,

271
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:34,692
I think he might be having some
sort of mild mid-life crisis.

272
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:36,193
But he had a motorcycle in college,

273
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:38,029
and it made him happy,
and I want to support him,

274
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:39,130
but I don't like it.

275
00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:41,432
But then I saw him in the garage
in a greasy T-shirt,

276
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:45,302
and he looked good. Like, 1993 good.

277
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:46,737
Mom. You okay?

278
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,205
Sweetie, where's the dog?

279
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,273
He got away.

280
00:10:50,342 --> 00:10:51,375
Wait, in here?

281
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:53,110
You brought the dog in the hospital?

282
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:54,211
I'm so sorry.

283
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:55,331
Again.

284
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:57,599
Uh, I'll check on your husband, okay?

285
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:01,419
- Qadri, go find the dog.
- Uh...

286
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,154
Qadri. I was third in my class.

287
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:04,121
Hey.

288
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:05,439
Dad has a nasty scalp lac,

289
00:11:05,473 --> 00:11:07,158
and I felt a step-off
on the right temporal area,

290
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:08,726
so we've got to rule out
a skull fracture.

291
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:14,298
I thought military people
prided themselves on their punctuality.

292
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:15,694
I paged you 20 minutes ago.

293
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:17,435
I was in the E.R.
and you paged me to a stairwell

294
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,546
and then you weren't there.

295
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,772
Well, I had to walk. I was stressed.

296
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,507
And attendings are never wrong.

297
00:11:25,277 --> 00:11:26,736
You're stressing
about the thing we both know

298
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:28,412
and can't talk about, right?

299
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:30,681
I know. I'm working with Dr.
Shepherd and Major Hunt today,

300
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:33,317
and I feel like I'm lying
to my commanding officer.

301
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:35,953
I hate secrets.
I've always hated keeping them.

302
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,456
They start out as these tiny
seeds of information,

303
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,493
and then they grow into these
terrifying Venus flytraps

304
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:45,796
that will eat your relationships
alive, one by one.

305
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:46,997
We have to do something.

306
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:49,300
- We?
- Yes.

307
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,367
Amelia's happy.

308
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:52,536
She's like "Leave It To Beaver,"
co-parenting happy.

309
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:56,540
She and Owen are completely
oblivious about the love child

310
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:59,343
that is just going to drop
on them like a bomb!

311
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:01,645
Babies are not bombs.

312
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,947
I'm very sorry.

313
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:05,216
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I used to have it together.

314
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,218
I used to be sane, but then HIPAA

315
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:09,987
and half-marriage proposals
and not enough sleep.

316
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,555
Dr. Avery proposed?

317
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,656
Go away. We're not friends.

318
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:13,765
Well, you paged me.

319
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,176
Go. Go!

320
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:16,794
- Hey.
- Hey.

321
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:18,395
- You okay?
- Yes.

322
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,164
I'm really sorry I didn't come
back with the milk last night.

323
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,299
I... I drove to the store, and then I...

324
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:26,370
I drove to the wrong house,
and I got tired, so I just...

325
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:28,339
I stayed there. But I did buy the milk.

326
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,740
Dr. Avery?

327
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:32,009
Nisha's cultures are back.

328
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,077
Uh...

329
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:34,411
Uh, can I... Can we talk later?

330
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:35,446
Mm-hmm.

331
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,319
We need to isolate her
and get her into O.R., stat.

332
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:43,921
Cece, I need you on the other
side of that glass

333
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:45,122
right now, please.

334
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:46,690
Her parents aren't here yet.
I don't want to leave her alone.

335
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,993
Right now. Please. Thank you.

336
00:12:49,027 --> 00:12:50,928
Nisha, you've got an infection, okay?

337
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:52,329
It's called necrotizing fasciitis.

338
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:53,397
It's very serious.

339
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:55,733
We're gonna get you straight
into the O.R., okay?

340
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:58,536
Tell my mom I love her.

341
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,905
Tell her thank you.

342
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:01,958
Tell her...

343
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:03,240
You're just getting started, Nisha.

344
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:04,608
Do you hear me?

345
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:07,061
You are just getting started.

346
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,747
Schmitt, wait.
We're not taking her to the O.R.

347
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:11,248
Let me get her to the basement.

348
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:13,117
What's in the basement?
I got to find Bailey.

349
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,623
You better be here to wonder and marvel

350
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:21,225
at the future of medicine.

351
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,287
That's exactly what I'm doing.

352
00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:28,299
Jo Wilson came up with
an insanely brilliant idea

353
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,367
that will change the way we do our jobs.

354
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:32,436
And I would like to offer her

355
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,472
a surgical innovation fellowship.

356
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:37,374
That is a thing that doesn't exist.

357
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:39,476
Exactly. That's why
we should invent it...

358
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:41,245
so we can wonder and marvel some more.

359
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,982
I just spent a lot
of money to make money, Grey.

360
00:13:45,016 --> 00:13:47,985
I need to let it make some money
before I spend any more.

361
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:49,153
We'd get to keep Alex.

362
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:52,323
The only way I could afford
a new fellowship for Jo Wilson

363
00:13:52,357 --> 00:13:56,460
is with the salary I'd free up
by losing Alex Karev.

364
00:13:56,494 --> 00:14:00,464
But I have to replace Karev,
so there is no money.

365
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:02,633
My patient has necrotizing fasciitis.

366
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,735
I need the hyperbaric chamber.
I think it's her only shot.

367
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:05,803
You want to debride her in here?

368
00:14:05,837 --> 00:14:08,106
How would you do that? You can't
use any electricity in here.

369
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,840
- No cautery, no...
- It's okay, I'll go old school.

370
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,675
- I'll just use a scalpel.
- No, you sit in here.

371
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,127
You don't operate in here.

372
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:14,278
Think of it like a spa.

373
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,013
Debriding in high-flow oxygen has shown

374
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:18,082
to improve survival outcomes
in crush injuries

375
00:14:18,116 --> 00:14:19,194
with wound infections.

376
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:21,452
Debriding with a scalpel
would take hours.

377
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,588
You'd be putting your staff at
risk for decompression illness,

378
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:26,023
a-and you'd be stuck in here.

379
00:14:26,057 --> 00:14:28,292
You couldn't leave until
it was depressurized.

380
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,793
Okay, this thing is useless.

381
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,528
I say we sell it and keep Jo Wilson.

382
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:33,264
Grey, the answer is no. Avery...

383
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:35,132
If DeLuca hadn't pulled me out
of the way of that van,

384
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,001
then that woman might be fine.

385
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:38,369
All right? She might have
been the one that called 911

386
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:40,371
and put me in the ambulance
for all that I know,

387
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:41,805
and I'm here, I'm okay.

388
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,307
I'm standing in a medical spaceship

389
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,875
that you built for us to save lives,

390
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,545
and the only one standing in the
way of me saving hers is you.

391
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,780
Please.

392
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,404
So?

393
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,972
She built a submarine in the basement,

394
00:14:58,006 --> 00:14:59,774
and apparently there's no money now.

395
00:14:59,808 --> 00:15:00,875
So, what do we do now?

396
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:03,477
I don't know. Wait for
more funds to become available?

397
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:05,213
I'd say for now, just go to Boston.

398
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:07,215
- As much as I hate it.
- We can't.

399
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:08,249
It's only a year.

400
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,384
We go, you learn
more cool stuff, we come home.

401
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:13,104
We can't because I already
called them and told them no.

402
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:15,181
I don't have a job.

403
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:16,749
Anywhere.

404
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,422
All right, once this
door closes, you're in.

405
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:27,126
If we depressurize too quick,
you will get nitrogen toxicity.

406
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,795
You're also looking at eardrum rupture,

407
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:34,634
lung collapse, sinus damage,
changes in vision, uh...

408
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,269
Don't forget to pop your ears!

409
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,731
Megan Salinas to Oncology.

410
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,620
Doug's CT shows a skull fracture

411
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:56,255
with a small bleed underneath it.

412
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,451
I gonna need to take him to the O.R.

413
00:15:57,485 --> 00:15:59,358
and drain it and relieve the pressure.

414
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,594
He needs brain surgery?

415
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,862
Actual brain surgery?

416
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,330
Honestly, it could've been a lot worse.

417
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,299
Motorcycle accidents without helmets...

418
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,268
Honey, maybe you should take
Hank to the cafeteria.

419
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,503
I want to stay with you.

420
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:11,771
Are you crazy?!

421
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,172
I'm not leaving you two alone again.

422
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,274
Wynnie, I am so sorry, but we'll be okay.

423
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,842
No, I had to drive you to the hospital,

424
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:18,311
and I don't even have a license!

425
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,946
She has her learner's permit.

426
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,213
No, I'm a terrible driver.

427
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:23,633
We could have all been dead today.

428
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:26,552
Dad!

429
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,354
Hey, guys.

430
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,189
Don't worry. I'm fine.

431
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,325
He's got a little bruise
on the inside of his head,

432
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,826
but I'm gonna fix it right up, okay?

433
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,311
Mm-hmm.

434
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,328
Well, surgery shouldn't be too long,

435
00:16:38,362 --> 00:16:40,066
so I can show you
where you can wait, okay?

436
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,300
I got him!

437
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,503
He may have eaten someone's
Jell-O, but I think he's okay.

438
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:45,530
Here's your dog.

439
00:16:45,564 --> 00:16:46,603
Oh, no, he's not our dog.

440
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:48,641
He's a stray we almost hit.

441
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,774
Can we keep him?

442
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,143
I'm allergic.

443
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,245
So lame.

444
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,247
No, don't just let him go...

445
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:56,403
Qadri.

446
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,554
Third in my class!

447
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,522
She's still hyperkalemic,

448
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:06,425
even with the dialysis
and the insulin drip.

449
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,761
Is she on her way up to the MRI?

450
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,864
Yes, uh, radiology should be
sending the results any minute,

451
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,200
and I asked Dr. Pierce
to meet you in the tech room

452
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,334
so she could have a look.

453
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,036
Great work, Helm.

454
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,479
Thank you.

455
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,841
Why are you looking at me like that?

456
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,576
Nothing. I'm not.

457
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,511
- Hey. You needed me?
- Yep.

458
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,179
Shea Drexler to Pathology.

459
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,381
Shea Drexler...

460
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:29,749
What do you got?

461
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,250
Motorcycle injury.

462
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,618
No helmet.

463
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,453
- Stupid.
- Yep.

464
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:35,755
You?

465
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,423
Matchmaker with a bad heart.

466
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,161
- Ironic.
- She's a matchmaker? Those still exist?

467
00:17:40,195 --> 00:17:41,694
I guess Internet dating is just so...

468
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,029
- Deceitful?
- Depressing.

469
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,797
Exactly.

470
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,238
Is there a dog in here?

471
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:47,400
- What?
- What?

472
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,093
No. Nothing.

473
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,806
I had an 89-year-old patient
in L.A. who hired a matchmaker

474
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,243
to help her find a man
who could drive at night.

475
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,277
That was her only requirement.

476
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:59,554
That's so sweet.

477
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:00,774
Well, they take the work out for you.

478
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:02,448
They weed out the creeps
and the emotional baggage.

479
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,117
They get you to that pre-vetted place.

480
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,485
Like where Owen and I are.

481
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,487
Which is where, exactly?

482
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,289
Where he's gonna drive her
around at night?

483
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,511
I think so.

484
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:12,825
I hope so.

485
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,493
I don't.

486
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:16,395
I don't hope that for you.

487
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,463
What?

488
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,798
Why not?

489
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,002
I just... You know what?

490
00:18:20,036 --> 00:18:21,300
Don't answer that until you have dealt

491
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,802
with your own half-proposal.

492
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,758
Jackson told me I'm married to my work.

493
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:25,912
Am I married to my work?

494
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:27,506
Oh, he just throws that word
around a lot, doesn't he?

495
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,593
Oh, they sent the studies.

496
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,780
I may be a little rusty with hearts,

497
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:36,082
but that looks like...

498
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,084
It's barely pumping.

499
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,753
The scar tissue's restricted
her entire heart.

500
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,136
Schmitt, if you stand there,

501
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,128
my elbow's gonna be in your face
for hours. I need you to move.

502
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,988
How many hours are we thinking?

503
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:54,834
I... I should have mentioned,
I'm a tad claustrophobic.

504
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:56,535
You're... You're standing on her suction.

505
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,079
Schmitt!

506
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,306
I didn't sign off on this!

507
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,374
I did. I signed.

508
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:03,626
Well, she's my patient, too.

509
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:05,211
Open up the... oor... I want in.

510
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,446
I... sor... I... y... e...

511
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,349
And why doesn't that work for
all the money I paid for that?

512
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,420
Let me in.

513
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:13,152
I can't. It's already pressurized.

514
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,453
They're in. You're out.

515
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,292
Oh, God.

516
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,895
I'm feeling like I, uh...
I can't breathe.

517
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,563
A-A-Anyone else feel that?

518
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,232
Like there's not enough air?

519
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:27,733
We're in compressed air.

520
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,002
It's literally the whole point
of this thing, all right?

521
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,004
So just grab a scalpel. Take a breath.

522
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:41,547
♪ Won't you tell him,
please, put on some speed ♪

523
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,583
♪ Follow my lead ♪

524
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:45,651
How's Nisha?

525
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,086
She's still in with Dr. Avery.

526
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,754
Cece, we need to talk about your heart.

527
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,891
Tell me I didn't kill that girl, Dr.
Grey. Please.

528
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,092
Go get me an update on Nisha, please.

529
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,996
Get me a crash cart.

530
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,601
Let's page Dr. Pierce.

531
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,055
- Charge to 100.

532
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,231
Clear.

533
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,287
DeLuca, I need a quick statement
about the O.R. fire yesterday.

534
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:15,612
How are you feeling?

535
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:16,646
Any pain?

536
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:18,515
You know what, Dr. Webber?
I'm not feeling any pain

537
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:20,016
for the first time in a long time.

538
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:21,918
That fire... It's like it woke me up.

539
00:20:21,953 --> 00:20:23,854
I mean, that
and the car crash, obviously.

540
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,956
But saving lives?

541
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,457
I mean, yeah, maybe it was
the adrenaline rush,

542
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:28,592
but I needed it.

543
00:20:28,626 --> 00:20:29,593
I needed all of it.

544
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:30,701
You know, I feel better.

545
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:32,529
I feel awake. I feel grateful.

546
00:20:32,563 --> 00:20:34,231
I feel awake and alive.

547
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:36,600
DeLuca, I just need to know
if you were injured in any way

548
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:37,968
- by the fire.
- Oh, yeah, no, I'm good.

549
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:39,436
Okay, thank you.

550
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:42,539
Stop! Oh!

551
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:45,742
First, I was worried about my heart,

552
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:46,846
but it was my kidneys.

553
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,144
Now that I'm worried about my kidneys,

554
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,613
you're worried about my heart.

555
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:52,449
Cece, I'd like to do a heart
biopsy on you, which is...

556
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:56,152
I've had three hearts, Dr. Pierce.

557
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:58,488
I could probably
do a biopsy on myself, so...

558
00:20:58,522 --> 00:20:59,489
Right.

559
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:01,324
Okay, so you know that I'll
have a better idea

560
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,426
once I can actually get in there
and see the muscle.

561
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:05,795
Okay, so let's change her dialysis bag,

562
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,665
start her on a lasix drip,
then get her upstairs.

563
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:09,766
On it.

564
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,501
Whatever you need, Dr. Grey.

565
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:23,265
I spent 35 years of my life
falling for straight women.

566
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:26,917
I don't know what you mean.

567
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:28,985
Hook me up to that thing and sit down.

568
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,556
Let me save you
from a whole life of misery.

569
00:21:35,793 --> 00:21:37,527
Dr. Zellman to Labor and Delivery.

570
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:40,368
Dr. Zellman

571
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:41,700
to Labor and Delivery.

572
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,094
Hey.

573
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:46,703
- Hey.
- How is she?

574
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:48,057
It's hard to say.

575
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:51,474
Stop!

576
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:53,545
Stop! Oh, stop...

577
00:21:55,212 --> 00:21:57,091
I'm Link, by the way.

578
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:59,760
- What?
- We haven't officially met.

579
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:02,686
Although you were kind enough to
let me know your marital status,

580
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,688
which I appreciated.

581
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:06,717
- No games.
- I should clear that up.

582
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:08,992
I was saying that
I wasn't married to my work.

583
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:10,694
Oh, yeah.

584
00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:12,662
No, that was not clear at all.

585
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:15,732
Dr. Avery was saying that
I'm married to my work,

586
00:22:15,766 --> 00:22:17,334
and I was saying that I wasn't.

587
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:19,736
Ah, got it. Yeah, so you are married.

588
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,171
No, I'm not, but that's not the point.

589
00:22:21,205 --> 00:22:23,673
The point is I have a life after work.

590
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,075
All right, that's cool.

591
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:26,710
- You mean like tonight?
- What?

592
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:28,645
I mean, I got to see
how this patient comes out,

593
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,247
but, uh, we could do a late drink?

594
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:33,961
Oh, no, I have a surgery I have to...

595
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:37,320
Your first name's Atticus?

596
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,155
Oh. Uh, eh.

597
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,758
Really mostly in writing.

598
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:43,727
Your name is Atticus Lincoln?

599
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:45,729
And you call yourself Link?

600
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:47,099
Yep.

601
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:50,102
Hmm.

602
00:22:51,102 --> 00:22:52,602
Wait, so your parents named you

603
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:56,172
after two of the greatest
figures of our time,

604
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:58,675
both literary and historical,

605
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:01,280
and you call yourself Link?

606
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:04,781
Okay.

607
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:05,915
It's shorter.

608
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:09,586
- Hey.
- Hey.

609
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,688
So, I'll elevate the fracture
and evacuate the hematoma.

610
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:13,709
It looks like it's gonna be
fairly simple.

611
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:17,504
Are we on a motorcycle
with only one helmet?

612
00:23:18,662 --> 00:23:20,797
- What?
- It's just...

613
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:24,801
Last time we did this, did us...

614
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:27,470
there were no strings.
It was uncomplicated.

615
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:29,739
And now there are strings.

616
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:30,707
And you don't want strings.

617
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:31,975
No, no, no, it's not that.

618
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:33,312
It's just...

619
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:36,146
Leo and Betty are stable,
they're doing great,

620
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,281
and I just want to make sure
that you and I...

621
00:23:38,315 --> 00:23:39,744
we're not being...

622
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:40,784
Reckless.

623
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:42,321
Right.

624
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:45,822
Let's talk after, okay?

625
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:47,457
Yeah.

626
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:56,299
All right. How are we?

627
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,168
Better.

628
00:23:58,202 --> 00:24:00,437
Ears a little stopped up, but...

629
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:02,217
Our patient. How's our patient?

630
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:03,273
Oh...

631
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:06,056
Pressure's up. Heart rate's stable.

632
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,177
Steady sats.

633
00:24:07,211 --> 00:24:11,681
And finally got ourselves
some viable tissue.

634
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:13,769
Blood has never looked so good.

635
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:15,919
Whoo!

636
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:19,956
And the peanut gallery's happy, too.

637
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,291
I can't believe it worked.

638
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:22,826
Such a crazy idea.

639
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,294
But brilliant.

640
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:26,463
Well, we got to try our best, right?

641
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:28,431
I mean, life's too short not to.

642
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,034
Right, 'cause you almost died.

643
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:33,961
Is... Is that why you proposed, too?

644
00:24:33,995 --> 00:24:35,071
What?

645
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:38,341
'Cause life is short, so you proposed.

646
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,110
Seems a little sudden, but...

647
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:42,045
Just stop talking. Irrigate the field.

648
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,507
Right.

649
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:46,015
I didn't... I didn't propose.

650
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,214
I will shut up.

651
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:48,407
Just irrigate the field.

652
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:50,487
She thinks I proposed?

653
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:51,788
Uh...

654
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:01,788
I screwed everything up.

655
00:25:01,822 --> 00:25:05,985
I made you quit your job here
because I had a job not here,

656
00:25:05,985 --> 00:25:07,719
I abandoned you on our honeymoon,

657
00:25:07,754 --> 00:25:10,722
and n-now you are married
to a day drinker, so...

658
00:25:10,757 --> 00:25:14,059
Look, you can call Mass General,
ask them to reconsider,

659
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:16,528
and, you know, just say that it was
some kind of misunderstanding.

660
00:25:16,562 --> 00:25:18,417
I don't want it.

661
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:23,635
I think I applied for
a fellowship in Boston

662
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,238
because I could apply
for a fellowship in Boston

663
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,839
because Paul's dead.

664
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:29,408
But I didn't stop to consider

665
00:25:29,442 --> 00:25:33,078
what I actually want,
which is not Boston.

666
00:25:33,112 --> 00:25:35,747
I hate Boston.

667
00:25:35,782 --> 00:25:38,317
Boston feels like I'm moving
backwards with my life.

668
00:25:38,351 --> 00:25:40,147
I want to move forward.

669
00:25:42,755 --> 00:25:44,589
You know what?

670
00:25:44,624 --> 00:25:45,924
I'm gonna talk to Bailey.

671
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,659
Bailey said there's no money.

672
00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:49,361
There is always money.

673
00:25:49,395 --> 00:25:51,029
You just have to make 'em...

674
00:25:51,064 --> 00:25:52,297
...want to spend it.

675
00:25:57,403 --> 00:25:59,571
All right. We're almost done here.

676
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:01,239
Sorry.

677
00:26:01,274 --> 00:26:03,241
Why are her vitals dropping?
We already debrided the source.

678
00:26:03,276 --> 00:26:05,510
I don't know. She's still
hypotensive, tachycardic.

679
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:07,507
Switching to manual ventilation.

680
00:26:08,214 --> 00:26:10,215
What is it? Why is she taking a dive?

681
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:13,118
Avery, what's happened?

682
00:26:13,152 --> 00:26:14,931
Check under the drapes!

683
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:21,093
She's crashing.
Max out her pressors. Come on.

684
00:26:24,163 --> 00:26:25,864
Check under the drapes.

685
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:26,898
W-What is he pointing at?

686
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:29,301
- The drapes?
- The drapes? Yeah, she's sterile.

687
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:32,491
Ex-fix! Look at the ex-fix!

688
00:26:33,991 --> 00:26:35,173
Infection spread to the ex-fix.

689
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:37,275
I need ortho to remove this hardware now.

690
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,410
Get in here. I can't get in!

691
00:26:38,444 --> 00:26:40,545
He can't come in until we
depressurize the room, right?

692
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,414
Damn it. All right. I'll take it
out myself. I'm taking it out.

693
00:26:42,448 --> 00:26:44,316
I'm taking it out. Yeah, yeah, remove it.

694
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,717
I'll stabilize it later.

695
00:26:45,752 --> 00:26:47,786
The ex-fix is holding
the entire leg together.

696
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,287
She's not gonna have a leg
if she's dead, Schmitt.

697
00:26:49,322 --> 00:26:50,454
Give me a wrench.

698
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:52,157
Something like a wrench. Think. Clamp.

699
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,135
Is she in rejection again?

700
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:04,636
The path results will let us
know for certain,

701
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,339
but she is in congestive heart failure.

702
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:09,307
Having two non-functioning kidneys

703
00:27:09,342 --> 00:27:11,610
is not making anything easier. Damn it.

704
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:14,012
She's not gonna make it.

705
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:15,447
It's just a biopsy.

706
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:18,316
I know, but she's not gonna
get a third heart

707
00:27:18,351 --> 00:27:19,651
while she's in kidney failure.

708
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:21,186
I think we both know that.

709
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,922
Are you upset because
you wanted to hire her?

710
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:25,657
No!

711
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:28,026
I'm upset because she's
dedicated her whole life

712
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,694
to helping people find love.

713
00:27:29,729 --> 00:27:32,364
You know she's got
like an 85% success rate.

714
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:33,665
She's an expert in her field.

715
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:35,300
She's like a UNOS of love.

716
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:36,968
It's got to be worth something.

717
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:39,104
Also, you wanted to hire her.

718
00:27:39,138 --> 00:27:41,473
I'm not the one buying
household goods in bulk.

719
00:27:41,507 --> 00:27:43,308
Do you want to talk about that?

720
00:27:43,342 --> 00:27:46,344
I'm gonna put in
an internal defibrillator,

721
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:49,781
and that should help with her
V-Tach and buy her some time.

722
00:27:49,816 --> 00:27:51,403
So you can hire her.

723
00:27:52,418 --> 00:27:53,905
You're not cute.

724
00:27:57,323 --> 00:27:58,824
V-Fib.

725
00:27:58,858 --> 00:28:00,826
All right, start CPR.
Let's flip her on her back.

726
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,327
All right, give me one of epi.

727
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:03,562
All right, guys, on my count.

728
00:28:03,596 --> 00:28:05,163
One, two...

729
00:28:10,536 --> 00:28:12,204
Start CPR. Got her?

730
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:13,805
- And we need the paddles.
- We don't have them.

731
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,102
What? Why?

732
00:28:15,137 --> 00:28:16,303
No electricity.

733
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:19,678
Come on. I live, you live, Nisha.

734
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:21,646
If I get to live, you get to live, okay?

735
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:23,482
If I get to live, you get to live.

736
00:28:23,516 --> 00:28:26,485
Please let her live. Let her live.

737
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:30,355
Your neuro exam looks good.

738
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:32,324
I'm not worried about permanent deficits.

739
00:28:32,358 --> 00:28:34,226
But you should stay here for
a few days just to be safe,

740
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,995
and a helmet would be a great idea.

741
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:39,498
- No. No helmet.
- Dad!

742
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:42,734
I'm never getting back on that thing.

743
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:45,337
I thought I wanted
to re-live something, but...

744
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:46,738
it's not worth it.

745
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:49,174
I want what I have now.

746
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:51,343
I'm so sorry I scared you.

747
00:28:51,377 --> 00:28:54,379
I'll find a way to get rid
of the bike, okay?

748
00:29:00,453 --> 00:29:02,954
Please let her live. Please.

749
00:29:02,989 --> 00:29:04,351
What's happening?

750
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:06,424
They can't get her pulse back.

751
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:07,526
How long has she been down?

752
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,314
At least 35 minutes.

753
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:13,265
How much epi?

754
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:15,433
7 rounds.

755
00:29:15,468 --> 00:29:17,402
No. She's gone.

756
00:29:20,273 --> 00:29:22,607
Come on. Come on, Nisha.

757
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:34,319
I need out of here.
Are you gonna call time of...

758
00:29:34,353 --> 00:29:36,421
Time of death, 18:21. I need out.

759
00:29:38,732 --> 00:29:40,458
Dr. Avery, we need to wait until the room

760
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:42,227
- is completely pressurized.
- Open the door.

761
00:29:42,261 --> 00:29:44,329
Open it! You'll put
yourself at extreme risk!

762
00:29:44,363 --> 00:29:45,730
No! Open the door and let me out!

763
00:29:45,765 --> 00:29:46,998
Now!

764
00:29:47,033 --> 00:29:49,434
Open the door. Maggie!

765
00:29:52,638 --> 00:29:55,173
- Jackson...
- Open the door!

766
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:56,775
Let me out!

767
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:15,306
So, my bad hearts gave me bad kidneys

768
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:17,266
which gave me a bad heart again.

769
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,309
Do I go back on the list?

770
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:20,901
We put in an internal defibrillator

771
00:30:20,935 --> 00:30:22,669
to keep your heart from misfiring,

772
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:26,073
but, yes, we will put you back
on the list for both organs.

773
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:29,309
Cece, the wait may be longer
than it was before.

774
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:31,011
It can be extremely difficult to find...

775
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:33,180
A match. I get it.

776
00:30:33,214 --> 00:30:35,382
How's Nisha?

777
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,194
Is she out?

778
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,889
Uh, her injuries were severe,

779
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,452
and they caused an infection
that spread rapidly.

780
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:49,563
So sorry. She didn't make it.

781
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,085
I don't want it.

782
00:30:54,636 --> 00:30:56,403
I don't want another heart.

783
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,938
- Cece...
- I don't want it.

784
00:30:57,972 --> 00:30:59,339
I killed that girl.

785
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:01,842
That poor baby girl.

786
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:03,844
I don't want it.

787
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:05,359
Just... go.

788
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:08,849
Just... just leave me alone.

789
00:31:56,698 --> 00:32:02,469
You paged me. To the bench.

790
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:07,992
I want the strings.

791
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,478
I have always wanted the strings.

792
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,447
I want the kids, I want the noisy house,

793
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:16,016
I want the fighting,

794
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,419
I want the dog.

795
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:20,505
I want the strings, Amelia.

796
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:23,824
So, I guess the real question is...

797
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,385
do you?

798
00:32:30,276 --> 00:32:32,332
I'm scared of them.

799
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,451
I'm still a little scared.

800
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:39,373
I mean, the tumor is gone,
but I'm still an addict.

801
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:40,941
Recovering.

802
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:42,999
Yeah. Recovering.

803
00:32:44,334 --> 00:32:48,715
But addicts tend to have certain
character traits in common,

804
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,884
and that includes fear, you know?

805
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:57,459
A certain wariness of change

806
00:32:57,825 --> 00:33:00,460
and commitment.

807
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:02,529
And, uh...

808
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:05,165
mini vans.

809
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:06,833
Hey, no one is getting a mini van.

810
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:08,903
No.

811
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,726
I don't want to be
reckless with the kids.

812
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:17,711
I don't want to threaten their stability.

813
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:20,847
Okay.

814
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:24,329
So...

815
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,062
for this lost lamb ♪

816
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,989
So...

817
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,291
I'm gonna try to be less wary.

818
00:33:34,963 --> 00:33:36,430
I'm really, really gonna try.

819
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:12,116
Good puppy.

820
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:22,209
I heard.

821
00:34:22,243 --> 00:34:24,420
That was a hell of a case.

822
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,947
She was too far gone, Bailey.

823
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,582
If it had been any other
type of infection,

824
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:31,218
- the chamber would've worked.
- Hmm.

825
00:34:31,252 --> 00:34:32,953
It's an excellent addition
to the hospital,

826
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,222
and you're responsible for it.

827
00:34:35,256 --> 00:34:37,124
You're still pitching for the job.

828
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,160
Look, I'm not gonna be better than you.

829
00:34:40,194 --> 00:34:42,562
I haven't been in this office in so long,

830
00:34:42,597 --> 00:34:44,765
so, by nature, there'll be kinks.

831
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:47,134
But out of everyone else, Bailey,
you have to admit that I have...

832
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,336
Richard, do you have a new sponsor?

833
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,971
Excuse me?

834
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,339
Ollie died.

835
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:54,141
You said you'd be a mess when she died.

836
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,610
You been talking to Catherine?

837
00:34:56,644 --> 00:34:58,311
I don't need to talk to Catherine.

838
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,814
I remember what happened
the last time you were chief.

839
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,251
I do not want to add more
to your plate right now.

840
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:05,439
Where are you going?

841
00:35:05,473 --> 00:35:07,921
If you'll excuse me, Chief,

842
00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:09,623
I need a meeting.

843
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:11,258
Richard...

844
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:12,459
- Hi.
- Richard!

845
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:13,686
- Dr. Bailey!
- What?!

846
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,529
I need you to give me five minutes

847
00:35:15,563 --> 00:35:18,632
to explain why the future
is here and the future is me.

848
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:21,034
My future, my future medicine.

849
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:22,703
Are you drunk, Wilson?

850
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:26,206
Only mostly, but I did not
do these drunk.

851
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:29,376
Why are you here?

852
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,844
It's my honeymoon.

853
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,456
You were right.

854
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:44,491
- About what?
- Jo Wilson's idea.

855
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:47,027
It is full of marvel and wonder,

856
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,529
- and it's gonna happen.
- Really?!

857
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,698
I just made her the first
official recipient

858
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,668
of the first surgical
innovation fellowship

859
00:35:54,702 --> 00:35:56,203
at Grey-Sloan Memorial.

860
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,872
- Oh, Dr. Bailey!
- Yeah.

861
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,207
Thank you!

862
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,843
You won't regret it. I promise.

863
00:36:02,877 --> 00:36:04,377
Where did you get the money?

864
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,012
I wrote a personal check.

865
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:08,515
And I know I won't be sorry,
because I'm running it.

866
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:10,350
Jo Wilson will be my fellow.

867
00:36:12,453 --> 00:36:14,020
What?

868
00:36:14,055 --> 00:36:16,323
You bought Jo Wilson?

869
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:18,225
I saw it as an opportunity to invest

870
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,760
in the future of medicine.

871
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:21,643
I'm downright philanthropic.

872
00:36:21,678 --> 00:36:23,430
You stole her.

873
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:25,899
You stole Jo and you stole my fellowship?

874
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,934
Hey, I didn't steal anything.

875
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:31,071
I took it because I'm taking
a step back from my job

876
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,940
in order to find a little joy,
a little tranquility,

877
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:36,040
and when Wilson pitched me

878
00:36:36,074 --> 00:36:38,578
her sci-fi space-medicine-of-the-future

879
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,920
fellowship, I thought,
"That, Miranda Bailey...

880
00:36:40,955 --> 00:36:43,116
That will give you joy and tranquility."

881
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:45,552
So I took it because I wanted it,

882
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:46,887
and also because

883
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:49,289
I had the will and the means to take it,

884
00:36:49,323 --> 00:36:50,489
and you did not.

885
00:36:50,524 --> 00:36:52,692
So, I suggest that you do as I am doing

886
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:55,262
and go find yourself some joy.

887
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,990
And if that doesn't work,
take it up with the chief,

888
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,567
'cause that ain't me.

889
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:02,269
Well, who is it, then?

890
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:14,447
- You're chief?
- No idea why.

891
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,882
You're chief?

892
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:17,284
Interim chief.

893
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,618
It's temporary.

894
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,420
And it's a win-win for everyone.

895
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:22,122
Jo gets this killer fellowship,

896
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:25,258
and I get this sweet office.

897
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:27,828
How is that a win for me?

898
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:29,796
You get me.

899
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,441
I'm staying.

900
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,781
All right, I get it.

901
00:37:33,815 --> 00:37:35,335
Jo was your work wife for a minute,

902
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:38,572
but now she needs to move on
to her own stuff.

903
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:40,173
It's not like she's cheating on you.

904
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:41,608
You'll get to see her in the hallways.

905
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:44,311
With Bailey, who made you chief.

906
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,113
Oh, you sound like a jealous girlfriend.

907
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,253
Nyah!

908
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,521
I only report to Bailey,

909
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:56,189
I'm gonna get to work in a fancy lab

910
00:37:56,224 --> 00:37:58,024
with cellular technology,

911
00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:00,193
and I get dark-blue scrubs,

912
00:38:00,228 --> 00:38:01,361
which makes me better than you.

913
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:02,972
And you.

914
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,367
What is that?

915
00:38:07,401 --> 00:38:09,169
My dog, apparently.

916
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,141
Here you go.

917
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:16,509
That's...

918
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,878
for me?

919
00:38:17,912 --> 00:38:19,312
You had a rough day.

920
00:38:19,347 --> 00:38:21,032
Glad to see you got sprung.

921
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:23,117
Thanks.

922
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,485
Well, here, I... I can pay...

923
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:28,521
You'll get the next one.

924
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,395
Why do we often run for the hills

925
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:37,464
when we feel the slightest connection?

926
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:44,337
What in God's name, DeLuca?

927
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:46,973
Hey, Dr. Webber!

928
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:48,708
She's pretty awesome, right?

929
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,844
Want to see what she feels like?

930
00:38:50,878 --> 00:38:53,231
No, I have somewhere to be.

931
00:38:56,517 --> 00:38:57,884
Okay.

932
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,920
Awake and alive, huh?

933
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:01,888
Get off.

934
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,557
Okay.

935
00:39:15,202 --> 00:39:18,238
♪ Push a little harder, harder

936
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,817
Give me the helmet.

937
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:31,751
Why do we feel compelled to fight

938
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,120
what we're hard-wired to do?

939
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:37,037
I'm sorry about last night.

940
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:39,986
- I...
- I don't understand.

941
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,762
- Well, I-I panicked because I...
- No.

942
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:43,839
Sorry.

943
00:39:43,873 --> 00:39:46,433
That I understand.
I get why you panicked.

944
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:50,136
I don't get why Nisha's dead
and we're alive.

945
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:51,638
Maybe it's because when we find

946
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:53,958
something or someone to hold onto,

947
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,543
that feeling becomes like air...

948
00:39:56,577 --> 00:39:58,945
We were pulled out of the way
of a car and she wasn't.

949
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,046
Why?

950
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:02,549
...and we're terrified
we're going to lose it.

951
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,818
Jackson...

952
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:06,720
I think you have a little PTSD.

953
00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:09,489
- It's not about the van...
- It's not just the van, I...

954
00:40:09,523 --> 00:40:12,143
Your whole world changed.

955
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:14,594
And then April.

956
00:40:14,628 --> 00:40:16,062
I'm happy for April.

957
00:40:16,097 --> 00:40:17,764
I know that. I know that.

958
00:40:17,798 --> 00:40:20,467
Your family empire crumbled.

959
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,487
Jackson, it's a lot.
You've been through a lot.

960
00:40:23,971 --> 00:40:25,531
Maybe.

961
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:28,784
I fell in love, though.

962
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:31,811
Well, I-I mean, if you're, like,

963
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,913
making a list of big things that...

964
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:41,589
I love you, Maggie.

965
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:46,459
I love you, too.

966
00:40:54,902 --> 00:40:58,505
- Sorry about my accidental proposal.
- It was sweet.

967
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,749
It was insane.

968
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:00,954
What are you talking about?

969
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,945
But you're right.

970
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,615
I guess I have some, uh,

971
00:41:08,649 --> 00:41:09,816
things to figure out.

972
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,884
And trust me,

973
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:13,520
you can get pretty good
at the along thing.

974
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:20,193
Cece...

975
00:41:23,097 --> 00:41:25,732
It was an accident.

976
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:29,220
You were hurt, and Nisha was hurt.

977
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,704
And you have to get a new heart

978
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,706
because Nisha would want you to.

979
00:41:36,034 --> 00:41:37,937
- And because I need you.

980
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,514
I need your help.

981
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:43,983
I am married to my work,
and I don't want to be.

982
00:41:46,387 --> 00:41:49,615
So, if you're still interested...

983
00:41:50,624 --> 00:41:53,159
Have a seat.

984
00:41:53,194 --> 00:41:54,594
But most things are better

985
00:41:54,628 --> 00:41:56,162
when they're shared with someone else.

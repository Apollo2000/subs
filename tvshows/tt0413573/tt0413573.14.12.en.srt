To do what exactly?

147
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:04,303
A traditional vaginoplasty...

00:06:04,337 --> 00:06:06,171
using ileum or the sigmoid colon...

149

gives you the feel of a vagina,

150

for prolapse and narrowing
or obstruction.

152
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:16,982
So, the goal is to find
a tissue that's smooth,

153

that secretes moisture

and repairs itself.

155
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:25,157
And I believe that tissue
is the peritoneum.

But the peritoneum protects
the internal organs.

Yes, but we'd only take a small portion.

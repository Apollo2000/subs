Top o' the morning, my little shamrocks.

5
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,362
Happy St. Paddy's Day.

6
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:29,713
- (kisses)
- (kids groan)

7
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,748
(gasps) None of you are wearing green.

8
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:34,331
I pinch you, I pinch
you, I pinch you, and you.

9
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:35,668
Ah, you pinched my boob.

10
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,498
Yeah, bring it down a notch, lady.

11
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,498
- When did you get up?
- 4:30.

12
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:40,980
I wanted to make corned beef hash.

13
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:42,878
Hash? Isn't that illegal?

14
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,678
It was, then it wasn't. What a ride.

15
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:46,800
An Irish coffee for you, Bob.

16
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:48,234
W-Wait-wait, there's whiskey in this?

17
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:49,401
What? No.

18
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:51,784
Is that what an Irish coffee
is? I was just calling it that

19
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:53,704
'cause I accidentally dropped
some corned beef in it.

20
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:55,768
(gulps) Yeah, yeah.
You-you dropped a lot.

21
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,870
Thank you, though,
for making all of this,

22
00:00:57,895 --> 00:01:00,624
but we're just gonna keep
St. Patrick's Day up here, right?

23
00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:02,792
No dyeing stuff green in the restaurant?

24
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:04,930
What? No. Just the beer.

25
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:06,045
- (groans)
- You'll love it.

26
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,110
Well, I'm glad you're
excited about today

27
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,070
because I'm really not
looking forward to going

28
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:12,314
to the depressing restaurant
liquidation auction.

29
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,910
Why is it depressing?

30
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,136
'Cause you're going
to a failed restaurant

31
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:17,400
to pick over its remains
for some cheap plates?

32
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:19,525
It's like taking the
boots off a dead guy.

33
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,329
And then serving food in those boots.

34
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:23,125
I'd buy plates at a
restaurant supply place,

35
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,564
but I heard you can
get 'em at an auction

36
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:26,056
for, like, a third of the price.

37
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:28,001
All right, Dad, let me
see your auction face.

38
00:01:28,026 --> 00:01:30,891
My auction face? Um, okay, this?

39
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,789
- That's it, I'm coming.
- You want to come?

40
00:01:32,814 --> 00:01:35,414
You need me to come. You
can't go in there alone.

41
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:37,000
With that face, they'll eat you up.

42
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:39,180
- And that hair. Sorry.
- I want to go.

43
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:41,174
I want to hear the
auctioneer talk really fast

44
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:42,255
and say a bunch of numbers.

45
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,309
100, 100. Do I hear 100? 100...

46
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:46,254
Sold, to the man with the hot son.

47
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:47,994
I could go for some auction action,

48
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:49,750
watch Dad get his "aucsh" on.

49
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,634
Plus, a failed restaurant liquidation?

50
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,369
Huh, it'll be like time-traveling
into our own future.

51
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:56,014
God, I hope it's not our future.

52
00:01:56,054 --> 00:01:57,050
Don't worry, Dad.

53
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,394
Future Gene is gonna be
a famous reggaeton star,

54
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:01,079
and you can live in his guesthouse.

55
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:02,753
You'll have to earn
hot tub access, though.

56
00:02:02,778 --> 00:02:03,995
- Wink, wink.
- Mm-hmm.

57
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,694
(overlapping chatter)

58
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:08,944
I have the light, people.
It's my turn to go.

59
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:11,626
- I know you can hear me.
- Maybe they're just shy.

60
00:02:11,658 --> 00:02:13,751
I bet they're going to the
St. Patrick's Day street fair

61
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,494
- on Front Street.
- Or it's a really inelegant

62
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:17,204
- flash mob?
- (car horn honks)

63
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:18,704
Happy St. Paddy's.

64
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:21,454
- Erin go bragh.
- More like "Erin go butt."

65
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,504
- Yup.
- I think this is my new favorite holiday.

66
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,806
- (grunting)
- Beachum Barbecue.

67
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:27,714
Huh, this might've
been a barbecue place?

68
00:02:27,754 --> 00:02:29,204
You cracked it, Tina.

69
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:30,971
And we're here to pick
the meat off their bones.

70
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:32,554
- It's so fitting.
- (groans)

71
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,224
Next item up for bid is lot three:

72
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:37,264
salt and pepper shakers, 30 sets.

73
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:38,915
Do I hear five dollars?

74
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,934
Okay, here they are...
No cracks, no chips,

75
00:02:41,984 --> 00:02:43,720
- but this definitely feels creepy.
- AUCTIONEER: Sold,

76
00:02:43,745 --> 00:02:46,040
for six dollars. What a steal.

77
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,782
I really thought
they'd go for more. Wow.

78
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:49,274
Okay, I can live with creepy.

79
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:51,485
(gulps) Ah...

80
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,034
Nothing like green beer
to get you in the spirit

81
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,877
of ol' St. Pat, huh? You
gonna join me, or, uh,

82
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:58,034
am I celebrating alone
like a sad person?

83
00:02:58,084 --> 00:03:00,129
Sure, what the heck?
I'll have a green beer.

84
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:01,512
It's only work.

85
00:03:01,537 --> 00:03:04,557
Gosh, it's a shame we only
get to dye beer once a year,

86
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:07,084
and that I'm not supposed to
dye anything else in here green.

87
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:08,870
Huh, what else can you dye green?

88
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,854
Lots of things, like, maybe
the mustard and the ketchup?

89
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,745
- That'd be cute.
- I'd eat green mustard.

90
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,261
Doctor's always telling me I got
to get more greens in my diet.

91
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:18,207
But Bob doesn't want
to dye anything else.

92
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:20,449
Damn Bob and his
mysterious hatred of green.

93
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:21,724
I am so over that guy.

94
00:03:21,749 --> 00:03:24,934
Maybe he wouldn't mind
if we just did one bottle.

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,535
Mmm. Oh, I can really
taste the food coloring.

96
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,652
Mmm, yeah, I had to use a lot. Ha,

97
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,363
- your mouth.
- (laughs) Your mouth.

98
00:03:32,388 --> 00:03:34,388
- Oh, God, look at us.
- Ah...

99
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:35,703
We look so Irish.

100
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,456
Wow. Think about all the
meals they cooked in here,

101
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:40,951
all the hopes and dreams
of whoever owned this place,

102
00:03:40,976 --> 00:03:42,226
poof, gone.

103
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,863
Actually, I don't want to
think about it. Oh, God.

104
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:47,896
- Dad, do you need a hug?
- No. Maybe.

105
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,122
Come here, you son
of a bitch. (grunting)

106
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:50,663
Why do you think it
went out of business?

107
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,942
Do you think they just
kept forgetting to switch

108
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:53,604
the sign to "open"?

109
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:55,382
I don't know. Maybe
people just stopped coming.

110
00:03:55,406 --> 00:03:57,036
Maybe the chef lost his touch.

111
00:03:57,076 --> 00:03:59,786
Maybe it was just a
lot of little mistakes,

112
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:01,101
but maybe they added up

113
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:03,936
and one day it all just
came crashing down. (laughs)

114
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:06,389
These slotted spoons are very slotted.

115
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:07,505
No slot shaming.

116
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,732
Um, did anyone else
think that guy's mustache

117
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:12,241
- looked a little weird?
- Who, Dad? You get used to it.

118
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,096
No, that guy.

119
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,056
Look, color's odd, shape's odd.

120
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:19,295
- It's peeling off a tiny bit.
- Oh, yeah.

121
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,905
It's a lip wig. I like it.

122
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,071
- All right, let's go in.
- Wait, kids.

123
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,858
Uh, no, no, no, don't bother him.

124
00:04:24,883 --> 00:04:26,013
Hey. So what's up?

125
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:27,608
Slotted spoons, that's your thing?

126
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:29,553
I love it. What else you gonna bid on?

127
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:31,920
Ah, you know, whatever
I can get a good deal on.

128
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:35,455
(laughs) Yeah. Perhaps a good
deal on a new fake mustache?

129
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,858
Uh, sorry about her.
Uh, y-your mustache

130
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:40,873
- doesn't look, um, that fake.
- Is it obvious?

131
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:41,672
Cutting off the price

132
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:43,221
- tag would have helped.
- Right, right.

133
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:45,928
So what's with the super
convincing disguise?

134
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,608
This is... this is my restaurant.

135
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,139
Oh, no. Uh, this is your place?

136
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,246
It was. Now it's the bank's.

137
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:55,319
- So you're a Beachum?
- Yeah. I'm Jules Beachum.

138
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:57,077
I basically grew up in this place.

139
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:59,191
Oh, uh, I'm Bob. So what happened?

140
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,186
Wh-Why'd you close?
Sorry, is that rude?

141
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:04,321
I just, I really need to
know because of, um, fear.

142
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,358
After my father retired, people
thought it changed around here.

143
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:09,253
They started coming less and less,

144
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:10,444
and I got behind on bills.

145
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:13,569
And one day, it was, it was just over.

146
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:16,028
Maybe we should start
paying our bills, Dad.

147
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:18,475
This is so sad. I-I'm so sorry.

148
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,960
So what kind of restaurant you got?

149
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:22,945
I assume you have one, judging
by your clogs and your fear.

150
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,756
Yup. Uh, it's a burger place.
So what are you doing here?

151
00:05:26,781 --> 00:05:28,834
- I'm here to get one thing.
- It on?

152
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:31,822
No. My family's flattop grill.

153
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:33,231
Oh, yeah. Makes sense.

154
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:35,796
All the history, all the
blood, sweat and pork butt

155
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,098
my family poured out onto this grill.

156
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:41,686
- Anyone else getting hungry?
- The flavors that took years to develop.

157
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:44,031
Those flavors belong to my family.

158
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:46,225
Uh, yeah, if there
was a fire in my place,

159
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,967
the flattop would be
the first thing I grab.

160
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:50,178
Oh, and also my kids. And-and my wife.

161
00:05:50,203 --> 00:05:52,733
- Aw.
- And the leather jacket I made you?

162
00:05:52,758 --> 00:05:54,848
Okay, so if you're here
to bid on the flattop,

163
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:56,833
I'm still not getting the disguise.

164
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:59,226
I'm not gonna bid on the flattop.

165
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:02,327
- Okay...
- You promise you won't act weird?

166
00:06:02,352 --> 00:06:04,514
Um, that's a weird thing to say.

167
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:05,928
- I'm gonna steal it.
- What?

168
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:08,051
- Nice.
- No, no, no, don't do that.

169
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,796
You promised you wouldn't act weird.

170
00:06:09,821 --> 00:06:11,246
Um, no, I-I didn't.

171
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:13,166
I'm just waiting for
them to put it on a dolly

172
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:15,352
and wheel it into the dining
room when it's up for bid.

173
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:16,420
A-And then what?

174
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:19,596
I run down the street with it to
my car, if I haven't been towed.

175
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:22,246
- I had to park in a no-no spot.
- This is a terrible plan.

176
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:24,511
It's been a tough couple of weeks, man.

177
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:27,716
I just don't want to feel like I
let my family's dream slip away,

178
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:29,378
and I got nothing to show for it.

179
00:06:29,403 --> 00:06:32,026
Look, I completely get that,
but not the other stuff,

180
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:34,230
- the stealing stuff.
- Well, now you know my plan,

181
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:36,026
so you're a part of it, like it or not.

182
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:38,726
No, I'm not... I'm-I'm
definitely not a part of it.

183
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:40,001
Yes, we are!

184
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:41,986
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Let's do this!

185
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:45,456
And then let's hit the museum
and take a nudie painting!

186
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:50,538
Next item, lot 22. Bus tubs.

187
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:52,971
I-I'm not gonna commit
grand theft flattop.

188
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,046
- I just came for plates.
- Face it, Dad,

189
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:57,397
the restaurant gods didn't
bring us here to get plates.

190
00:06:57,422 --> 00:06:59,022
Yeah, we're supposed to help Jules

191
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:00,631
steal back his family jewel.

192
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:03,608
Shouldn't sad restaurant
people help each other out?

193
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,374
There are better options
other than stealing it.

194
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:07,185
Y-You-you could
talk to the bank?

195
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,209
Oh, yeah, sure, yeah, they're
super nice about stuff, right?

196
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:11,314
That's their thing.

197
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:13,314
Or you could wait for someone to buy it

198
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:15,232
and then ask if you can come visit it?

199
00:07:15,257 --> 00:07:17,107
Yeah, nothing's really
beating "steal it."

200
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:19,534
No, we can't steal the
flattop. That's stealing.

201
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:21,427
Look, Jules, even if
you did do your plan,

202
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:23,115
you also have no plan.

203
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,760
The plan is that we work together

204
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:27,568
to get the biggest thing out
of here without getting noticed.

205
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:29,643
Too bad Jules doesn't
want his family whisk

206
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:32,130
'cause that'd be just,
like, plop, down the pants.

207
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:34,443
And if anyone asked, "Is
that a whisk in your pants?"

208
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:36,076
we'd say, "That's my wiener, sir,"

209
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:38,021
and we'd tip our cap and off we'd go.

210
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:40,083
Bob, just help me steal my flattop,

211
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:42,693
and if this ever happens to
you, I'll help you steal yours.

212
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:44,810
No. This isn't a suicide pact.

213
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:47,333
Is it even stealing if
it's your family's flattop?

214
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:49,978
Well, technically, it's
stealing from the bank,

215
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,730
which makes this like bank robbing,

216
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:52,925
which makes this great.

217
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,419
Oh, my God, it is
just like bank robbing.

218
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:57,886
- Yeah.
- And anyone notice a missing whisk?

219
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,816
- Gene, put it back.
- Oh, boo.

220
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:04,159
Green fries? Are you kidding
me? What a day to be alive.

221
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,144
All right, now that we're
officially doing this...

222
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,784
Even though Bob didn't want us to...

223
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,581
Should we, you know... ?

224
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:11,042
- What?
- Dye the burgers.

225
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:14,011
(laughs) What color? Oh, right. Green.

226
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:16,548
Yeah, once the lunch rush
hits, if Bob comes back

227
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:19,089
and sees these people ordering
green burgers left and right,

228
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:21,714
he'll say we should dye the
meat green every St. Paddy's Day,

229
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:22,933
probably Christmas, too.

230
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:25,862
And Arbor Day, Labor Day, Green Day Day.

231
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,109
Ah, that ought to do it.

232
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:30,134
And mix, mix, mix, mix, mix, mix, mix.

233
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,209
Uh, too much green, got
to add a little beef.

234
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:35,339
(grunts) Ah, too
beefy, needs more green.

235
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:39,066
(grunts) Just a little
more meat to balance it out.

236
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:43,206
Now it's fun. And now all
our ground beef is green.

237
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,021
What was the old
color? I don't remember.

238
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:48,597
Next item, lot 30, more bus tubs.

239
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:51,003
Do I hear ten dollars?

240
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:53,011
Pretty please? That's
an auctioning term.

241
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:56,214
Okay, stealing the flattop...
Let's go over the pros and cons.

242
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:58,029
Con... You could get arrested.

243
00:08:58,054 --> 00:08:59,604
So, con... you become a con.

244
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:02,209
- Mm-hmm. And pro... ?
- There is no pro.

245
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:04,597
Maybe we should help him,
Dad. This could be you.

246
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:06,214
He even has a fake mustache like you.

247
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,925
My mustache is real, Tina.

248
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,539
You keep telling yourself that, pal.

249
00:09:09,564 --> 00:09:12,089
You know what, Bob? You're
right. It's a dumb plan.

250
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:14,042
I just thought I could
save at least one little bit

251
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,284
of my family's dream, but
that's not gonna happen.

252
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:17,705
Let's take a little break, shall we?

253
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,299
Give you all a minute to
find your money. (chuckles)

254
00:09:20,324 --> 00:09:21,824
And give me a chance to call my mom.

255
00:09:21,864 --> 00:09:22,909
She doesn't know I do this.

256
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:24,980
She thought I said "actuary,"
and I never corrected her.

257
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:27,469
- Oh, my God, now's my chance.
- No, no, wait, no.

258
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,878
- Bob, Bob, grab the other end.
- Oh, God.

259
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,198
I don't want to do this.
I don't want to do this.

260
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:34,081
Quick. (grunts) Let's
get this onto the dolly.

261
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,761
I can't believe I'm
doing this. (grunting)

262
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:39,183
I mean, you're barely
doing it, no offense.

263
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,544
Okay, let's just roll it
right out the back door.

264
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:45,769
(groans) No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

265
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,706
- I'll navigate.
- This is great, Jules.

266
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:50,612
This is working. Oh,
man, this feels good.

267
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:53,277
(laughs) Shut up, shut up.

268
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:56,749
What the heck is going on?

269
00:09:56,774 --> 00:09:58,539
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

270
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,364
Yeah, it's padlocked.
Wait. Jules Beachum?

271
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:03,906
Yes, it's me, Jules Beachum.

272
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:05,914
Yeah, no, I know. That's
why I said your name.

273
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,882
Step away from lot 92.

274
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,195
This grill belongs to my family.

275
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,382
No, it belongs to the bank,
and soon to one of these people.

276
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:16,045
Uh, hi. I-I know it looks like
I'm helping Jules steal this.

277
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,789
I'm not. I-I was falling,
and my hands landed on it.

278
00:10:19,814 --> 00:10:21,531
Come on, Bob, front door, front door.

279
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:24,279
- Go, go, go!
- (grunts)

280
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:25,664
But he's in front of the door.

281
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:28,094
Remember when I said you had a bad plan?

282
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:30,119
This is what bad plans look like.

283
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:32,354
- Stop. Just stop right there.
- I'm so sorry.

284
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:34,531
Kitchen, kitchen. Back in the kitchen.

285
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:36,242
Retreat, retreat!

286
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:38,460
All right. That'll buy us a minute.

287
00:10:38,485 --> 00:10:40,054
AUCTIONEER: Give up,
Jules, you're trapped.

288
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,829
He's right. There's no other door.

289
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:43,274
Can we just not do this?

290
00:10:43,324 --> 00:10:44,420
- Quick, in here.
- What the... ?

291
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:47,074
- (groans)
- TINA: Is it gonna fit?

292
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:49,101
- Just barely.
- Oh. Hang on.

293
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,244
(grunting)

294
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,140
- Why'd you open a window?
- 'Cause they'll think

295
00:10:53,164 --> 00:10:54,413
- we escaped through there.
- Right,

296
00:10:54,438 --> 00:10:55,999
but the grill can't
fit through that window.

297
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:57,234
You're overthinking this, Dad.

298
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:00,265
Open window equals "Maybe
they went that way."

299
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:03,140
- (grunts) Where'd they go?
- Look.

300
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:04,717
They must have gone out that window.

301
00:11:04,742 --> 00:11:06,429
The grill can't fit through that.

302
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:07,843
Maybe they folded it?

303
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,409
They folded a steel grill?

304
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:10,913
I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

305
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,144
Should we call the police?

306
00:11:12,184 --> 00:11:13,554
Eh, that'll be a whole thing.

307
00:11:13,604 --> 00:11:16,085
Let's go back to the auction
and deal with this later.

308
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,184
My idea going once, going
twice. Sold. Let's do my idea.

309
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:20,809
I can't believe you
talked us into this, Dad.

310
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:22,754
It's very irresponsible of you.

311
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,299
Shame on you. Bad boy.

312
00:11:24,324 --> 00:11:27,434
I don't like any of
you. Except maybe Tina.

313
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,089
- Hey. - Ouch.
- Yes.

314
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,059
This is all great, day's
going great. Just great.

315
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:36,215
What is this place, a spice dungeon?

316
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,364
It was my family's hiding spot
for the ingredients that we use

317
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:40,495
in our top secret barbecue sauce.

318
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,294
- Powdered orange drink mix?
- Well, don't shout it.

319
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,489
- (whispers): Sorry.
- Mm, mm.

320
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:46,374
Oh, yeah, this would
go great on finger meat.

321
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,439
So you make your secret
sauce from all this?

322
00:11:48,464 --> 00:11:51,724
Yep. 49 ingredients
in very precise amounts

323
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:54,354
that my dad wrote down in his
very hard-to-read handwriting.

324
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:57,354
You read this. Does that
say "teaspoons" or "teacups"?

325
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:59,169
I-I think it's "teaspoons."

326
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:01,249
Wait a minute. Maybe
it does say "teacups."

327
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:03,234
So, you don't know the right amounts?

328
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:06,139
Well, honestly, I put this
in, I don't put this in.

329
00:12:06,164 --> 00:12:07,419
I can't taste the difference.

330
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:09,324
- Wait, really?
- Yeah, it's not my thing.

331
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:11,914
It was... I guess it was never my thing.

332
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,284
What? Wh-What do you mean?

333
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:15,164
This place was my parents' dream.

334
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:16,422
It wasn't, like, my dream.

335
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:18,264
Then why are we stealing your flattop?

336
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:19,844
I just thought I needed, uh...

337
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:22,004
to keep some piece of this place.

338
00:12:22,044 --> 00:12:23,124
Yeah, the heaviest piece.

339
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:24,414
So, what is your dream?

340
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:25,794
Yeah, it's-it's silly.

341
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:27,344
It's, uh, beekeeping.

342
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:30,284
- My dream is to keep bees.
- Keep bees?

343
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:31,554
Yeah. It's been a hobby. Fell into it.

344
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:35,159
It was a rocky start. I had
two bees in a jar and they died.

345
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:36,919
And you don't mash 'em up to make honey.

346
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:39,474
- Nobody tells you that.
- Nobody should have to.

347
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:41,424
But then I got a book
and I got a hive and I got

348
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:43,209
one of those cool suits, which I love.

349
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:45,314
I love wearing it, and I
think I look good in it.

350
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:47,152
And, yeah, my dream is to go pro.

351
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:49,534
But it's just really, really
hard to milk bees to get honey.

352
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:51,154
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

353
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:53,574
- I don't do that anymore.
- AUCTIONEER: Lot 76,

354
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:55,075
a set of plates in excellent condition.

355
00:12:55,114 --> 00:12:57,114
- Huh?
- Do I hear $40?

356
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:58,204
Oh, come on. $40?

357
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,394
- I was willing to pay $50.
- No?

358
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:01,954
- Okay, well, how about $30?
- (whimpers)

359
00:13:02,004 --> 00:13:04,550
$30 over here. $30 going
once, $30 going twice.

360
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,662
Here.

361
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:08,924
Sold,
for the surprisingly low price of $30. Wow.

362
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:10,464
(groans)

363
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,360
What do we even need plates for?

364
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:14,374
Yeah, laps are the plates of the body.

365
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,279
What secret ingredient is this?

366
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:18,014
Oh, those are my dad's ashes.

367
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:20,184
-Aah!
-I'm kidding. I think it's pepper.

368
00:13:20,224 --> 00:13:21,589
My dad's dog Pepper.

369
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:23,224
<i>LINDA: I don't get it.</i>

370
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:25,657
How come these green
burgers aren't selling?

371
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:28,154
Beats me. What's not
fun about green meat?

372
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:30,379
- (entry bell jingles)
- Happy St. Paddy's Day.

373
00:13:30,404 --> 00:13:32,009
Uh, happy St. Paddy's Day to you.

374
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:35,144
So, you're in luck. Our
burgers today are green-colored

375
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:36,829
in honor of the late St. Patrick.

376
00:13:36,854 --> 00:13:39,074
He only ate green foods.
So what can I get you?

377
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:40,868
Oh, uh, no green burger for me.

378
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:43,813
- Regular burger would be great.
- Yeah, same for me.

379
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:46,416
Are you crazy? It's the
one day a year you can eat

380
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:48,229
a green burger and not get super sick.

381
00:13:48,254 --> 00:13:51,485
That is true. A-And what if I told you

382
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,760
that we don't have regular
burgers, just green ones?

383
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:56,134
Uh, we would not eat here?

384
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,563
What if you closed your eyes

385
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,485
and pretended it was a brown burger?

386
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,087
- We'll, um, come back tomorrow?
- Maybe?

387
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:04,697
-You need to try 'em. How you gonna know?
-I don't need to try it.

388
00:14:04,722 --> 00:14:06,618
Are you gonna go through
life never trying anything?

389
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:08,403
-You're pushing. It's, it's a pull.
-Don't go.

390
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:09,603
Don't leave. Don't go.

391
00:14:09,643 --> 00:14:10,596
- I'm pulling.
- Have a beer.

392
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:12,268
What's going on with everyone today?

393
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:13,784
Where's the St. Paddy's Day spirit?

394
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:15,924
I'm gonna have to toss out
15 pounds of green meat.

395
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:18,104
Too bad the St.
Patrick's Day street fair

396
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:19,448
isn't right here on Ocean Avenue.

397
00:14:19,473 --> 00:14:21,463
I bet those people would
gobble up green meat.

398
00:14:21,488 --> 00:14:24,448
Huh. What if we go to them?

399
00:14:24,473 --> 00:14:25,968
How would we... How we gonna do that?

400
00:14:25,993 --> 00:14:28,612
I'll make slider burgers
and pass them out there.

401
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:30,543
- Right.
- Sure, we won't make money

402
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:32,323
and that's bad and Bob won't like that,

403
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:34,010
but it'll be great advertising.

404
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:36,854
Eh, you know what we do? We tell
'em it's ground-up leprechaun meat.

405
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,431
Exactly. And tomorrow we'll be packed.

406
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:41,682
Drunk people always
remember things the next day.

407
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:42,797
They sure do.

408
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:45,633
(groans) Oh, what do we do?

409
00:14:45,658 --> 00:14:47,643
Should we call Mom, tell
her we live here now?

410
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:49,418
We could last for days in here.

411
00:14:49,443 --> 00:14:51,313
Spices are food, right, Dad?

412
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:52,933

- Nice save.
- Okay, hear me out.

440
00:15:57,912 --> 00:15:59,309
- Okay.
- We give up.

441
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,979
- Give up?
- And then we leave this room.

442
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,245
- Leave this room?
- Look, Jules, I-I don't know

443
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,762
how we're gonna get this
flattop to stay in your family.

444
00:16:05,787 --> 00:16:07,481
At this point I think we're just trying

to keep you from being arrested.

446

Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah,
right, right, right, yeah.

447
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:14,143
But if we can talk the auctioneer
out of calling the police,

448
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,418
I think we could find a
good home for your grill.

449
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,255
Yeah, maybe it'll live
on a farm somewhere.

450
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,247
Like our Sea-Monkeys.

451
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:21,504
No, I don't want it
going to some reseller,

452
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:23,693
ending up somewhere
it's not gonna be loved.

453
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,759
I promise we'll try and get
it in the hands of someone

454
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:27,480
who's gonna use it,
someone's whose dream

455
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:29,823
- is having a restaurant.
- Maybe you're right.

456
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:32,808
I guess I should let this
thing live on someplace else.

457
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,888
Okay, I think I'm ready to let it go.

458
00:16:34,913 --> 00:16:36,271
We're taking Pepper out of here, right?

459
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,809
Good point. Wait, is that Pepper?

460
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,518
Or is that Pepper? Which one's Pepper?

461
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:42,183
This one's either paprika or dog.

462
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,293
Well, well, well, look who's back.

463
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:46,591
TINA: We didn't actually fold the
grill and climb out the window.

464
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:48,633
Oh. None of us thought you did.

465
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:50,513
Uh, hi, yeah. So, um...

466
00:16:50,538 --> 00:16:52,832
We're really sorry about
the whole flattop thing.

467
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:54,441
Hopefully you didn't call the police.

468
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:57,615
And please don't, since
we're, um, a-apologizing.

469
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,853
(sighs) I won't call
the police if you promise

470
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:01,857
you're done with this little freak-out.

471
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:03,052
Yeah. We're done.

472
00:17:03,077 --> 00:17:04,497
- So, can I sell it?
- Wait.

473
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:06,362
Can I just say something first?

474
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:09,260
- This flattop is special.
- Hey, I was gonna say that.

475
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:11,145
This flattop is special.

476
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:12,442
Let's start the bidding at a thousand.

477
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:14,333
Wait, wait, wait. I-I made a promise

478
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:16,490
that I'd try to get this to
someone who will appreciate it.

479
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:17,635
Not just a reseller.

480
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,091
- Hey.
- Sorry. You're great.

481
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:22,848
- At reselling, I think.
- Thank you.

482
00:17:22,873 --> 00:17:25,286
(sighs) Look, this flattop is special.

483
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,996
I have one just like it,

484
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:28,938
and we work hard to
make good food on it.

485
00:17:28,963 --> 00:17:32,357
So, if there's anyone here who
would really love this flattop

486
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:34,762
and, a-and-and scrape
it a little more...

487
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:37,349
This one looks like someone
fell behind on that...

488
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:39,365
Anyway, please bid on this.

489
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,888
- $20,000.
- Gene.

490
00:17:40,913 --> 00:17:42,579
Does anyone here own a restaurant

491
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,380
or-or trying to start a restaurant?

492
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:45,839
That's not really how we do this.

493
00:17:45,863 --> 00:17:47,483
You're kind of stepping on my thing.

494
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:49,653
Do I hear a thousand?

495
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,169
- I'll go a thousand.
- What are you doing, Jules?

496
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:54,833
You promised me, Bob. No resellers.

497
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:56,198
Whoa, whoa.

498
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,968
No, no, no, no, no. No, no.

499
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:01,396
Go, flattop, go! You're free now, boy.

500
00:18:03,677 --> 00:18:07,365
Ow, my joints. Running
downhill, I hate it so much.

501
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,325
Grab it. Jules, get in front.

502
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,470
Grab the sides.

503
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:12,403
Oh, thank God, nobody got hurt.

504
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:14,803
Aw, man, it hit my car.

505
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:17,349
That's your car? It's
really small, Jules.

506
00:18:17,374 --> 00:18:19,789
- This was never gonna fit in there.
- But on the plus side,

507
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:21,619
you'll always have that
dent to remember it by.

508
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:22,774
And you didn't get a ticket.

509
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,731
- Oh, yeah, you did.
- You got two.

510
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:27,356
LINDA: Bob's Burgers. Free samples.

511
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:28,888
They're tiny, they're green.

512
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:30,613
You're drunk. I'm tipsy.

513
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:31,733
Free green meat.

514
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:33,573
BOTH: Free green meat.

515
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,719
- Let's go.
- Free green meat.

516
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:35,799
- You know you're hungry.
- Free green meat.

517
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,943
You're gonna throw up.

518
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:38,678
- Free green meat.
- She's throwing up.

519
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:42,046
She's puking all over.
That is disgusting.

520
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:44,688
Look at that damage. I
won't be able to move this.

521
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:47,463
- I'm out.
- Okay, let's try this again.

522
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:49,963
Do I hear, uh, $300?

523
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,423
- I'll bid $300.
- Do I hear $350?

524
00:18:52,488 --> 00:18:54,046
No? Why would I?

525
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:55,553
Sold, $300.

526
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,302
Please, tell me you have a restaurant?

527
00:18:57,327 --> 00:18:59,206
I'm opening one up. A cheesesteak place.

528
00:18:59,231 --> 00:19:02,143
That's great. See, Jules, your
grill's gonna make cheesesteaks.

529
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,363
Yeah, I'm calling it
Yummy Yummy Cheesy Beefs.

530
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:07,523
- Okay.
- And my hook is gonna be,

531
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,317
instead of serving 'em on hoagie buns,

532
00:19:09,342 --> 00:19:10,903
I'm gonna use waffle cones.

533
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:13,940
Uh, maybe don't tell us
any more of your fun ideas,

534
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:15,703
but, uh, good luck with that.

535
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:17,418
Point is, it's-it's living on.

536
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:18,993
So, how are you feeling?

537
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,182
- Okay, I think.
- You know, Jules, your parents

538
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:23,137
would want you to follow your dream.

539
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,703
I want that for my kids.

540
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:26,835
You have kids? I thought
those were just your friends.

541
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,372
- Uh, they're not my friends.
- (laughs): Yeah, no.

542
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:31,966
- I mean, we're work friends.
- GENE AND LOUISE: Eh...

543
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:35,054
So, if your heart's telling
you to be a beekeeper...

544
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,218
- I just wish I wasn't allergic.
- (sighs): Oh, my God.

545
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:38,468
But that makes it exciting.

546
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:40,868
Mm, call us when you
get that honey, honey.

547
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,163
I guess we'll just tell your
mom the plates were cursed.

548
00:19:44,188 --> 00:19:45,603
There's no way of explaining

549
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,643
how many bad decisions
we made back there.

550
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:49,216
You might not have
gotten a deal on plates,

551
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:51,733
but you did help a guy
follow his bee dream.

552
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,444
And also helped another
stranger with his dream...

553
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:54,526
Yummy Yummy Cheesy Beefs.

554
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:55,588
And we're going there when it opens

555
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:56,839
'cause that place sounds perfect.

556
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,427
Dad, you're so good
at touching strangers.

557
00:19:59,452 --> 00:20:01,277
I feel alive or something.

558
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:03,493
I stared our restaurant's
death in the face

559
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:04,848
and I'm stronger for it.

560
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:07,615
Maybe I'll try not to constantly
think we're gonna fail.

561
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,130
Or if I do, I won't say it out loud.

562
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:10,896
Save it for my wedding speech.

563
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,285
Why is the restaurant closed?

564
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,680
Where's your mother?

565
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,035
And why does it look like
a Shrek exploded in here?

566
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,099
Oh, my God. Your mother went rogue.

567
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:20,553
No, she went brogue.

568
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:22,052
Irish? Brogue?

569
00:20:22,077 --> 00:20:23,693
- Get it?
- Nice one, T.

570
00:20:23,718 --> 00:20:26,183
- (groans)
- LINDA: Come inside, everyone!

571
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,693
I'll fire up the grill. Who
wants a St. Paddy's Day melt?

572
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,443
- Lin?
- Hi, Bobby!

573
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:32,023
We got some customers. Look.

574
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:34,483
- I see that.
- They're drunk and hungry.

575
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:36,678
- And not too rowdy.
- Great.

576
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,878
But we don't have to
make green burgers, do we?

577
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:40,878
- Green burgers for everyone!
- Yep. Yep.

578
00:20:40,913 --> 00:20:43,413
TEDDY: Hey, we're starting a conga line!

579
00:20:43,438 --> 00:20:45,438

2
00:00:20,718 --> 00:00:22,638
Gene, Tina, hurry up.

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,476
Those eggs aren't gonna eat themselves.

4
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:27,068
But they will eat this
bacon. Eat it. Eat it!

5
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:28,639
I'm leaving for school in three minutes

6
00:00:28,664 --> 00:00:30,374
with or without you,
and I'm the only one

7
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:31,789
- who knows the way.
- We know the way.

8
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:33,830
You turn left where that
cloud looks like a dolphin.

9
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:35,855
Louise, what's the big
rush to get to school?

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,187
Because I only get to
be principal for one day,

11
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:39,633
and I don't want to miss a minute of it.

12
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:41,492
Oh, yeah, your big prize.

13
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:43,977
For selling the most candy
bars in that school thing.

14
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,132
My little Glengarry Glen Louise.

15
00:00:46,157 --> 00:00:48,197
I busted my ass hawking that choc.

16
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,190
And possibly broke some laws.

17
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,969
Four bucks for a candy bar?

18
00:00:52,994 --> 00:00:55,704
I can get you onto
Sweet Street for three.

19
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:58,581
Instead of a dumb tip for my mom,

20
00:00:58,606 --> 00:01:00,986
how about some chocolate for your mom?

21
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:03,681
Chocolate bars! Get your chocolate bars!

22
00:01:03,706 --> 00:01:06,432
Very unofficial treat of the Wonderdogs.

23
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:07,827
Hello. Bye!

24
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:09,692
Wait a minute. You sold me so many.

25
00:01:09,717 --> 00:01:12,387
And I'm beginning to think
there never was a golden ticket.

26
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:14,912
So, sweetie, what are
you gonna do as principal?

27
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:16,643
Oh, you know, abuse my power

28
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:18,208
- to the fullest extent.
- Cool.

29
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:21,107
But my number-one goal?
The Cabinet of Confiscation.

30
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:23,172
What's the Cabinet of Confiscation?

31
00:01:23,197 --> 00:01:26,487
It's a year's worth of priceless
loot confiscated from students.

32
00:01:26,512 --> 00:01:29,772
All in one place:
Principal Spoors' office.

33
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:32,119
The fidget spinners
alone are worth millions.

34
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:34,064
We're talking inappropriate comic books,

35
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:36,049
fireworks, fake vomit.

36
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:37,180
That's my favorite kind of vomit.

37
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:38,789
Um, Louise, I guess something else

38
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:40,611
you could get out of being principal

39
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:43,926
is learning about, you know,
leadership and responsibility.

40
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:46,245
Oh.

41
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,376
Uh, yeah, I agree. Good stuff, Bob.

42
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,878
Uh, I'm the good parent.
Everyone remember that.

43
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,924
Let's roll! I'm driving.

44
00:01:54,393 --> 00:01:55,699
Morning, Ms. Schnur.

45
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:57,985
Coffee, two sugars.
Actually, seven sugars.

46
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,471
You know what? Just make it sugar.

47
00:01:59,504 --> 00:02:01,189
- Excuse me?
- We're about to dive into

48
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:02,964
my First Hundred Minutes agenda,

49
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,289
so you may want to hit the
bathroom before we start.

50
00:02:05,314 --> 00:02:07,484
First off, I only go at home.

51
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:10,134
Kids aren't the only ones who
have trouble going at school.

52
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,079
Second, I don't work for you, Louise.

53
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:14,401
How about a little less chitchat, babe?

54
00:02:15,064 --> 00:02:17,144
- Weird.
- There she is.

55
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:18,759
Principal for a Day.

56
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:20,104
Uh, why is my door locked?

57
00:02:20,194 --> 00:02:21,774
- Your door?
- Principal?

58
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:24,259
You know you're not
really principal, right?

59
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:28,114
- It's a ceremonial role.
- Ceremonial?

60
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:29,525
You get to supervise the flag-raising,

61
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,970
water the school plant,

62
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:32,745
phone in today's
attendance to the district.

63
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,830
That's a fun voice mail to leave.

64
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:36,850
Ordinarily, Principal Spoors

65
00:02:36,874 --> 00:02:38,164
would walk you through your day,

66
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,439
but he's attending a
leadership conference.

67
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:41,849
Leadership.

68
00:02:41,874 --> 00:02:43,294
- Wha... ?
- Nothing.

69
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,479
All right. Let's get this
crap show on the road.

70
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:46,884
I've got counseling to do.

71
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:48,459
I'm breaking in a new therapy doll:

72
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:50,614
Online Shamin' Damon.

73
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:01,619
Whew! What a full day
of being principal.

74
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:04,694
It's only 9:15. I
haven't done anything yet.

75
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,639
You still have the
flag-lowering at 3:00,

76
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:09,004
so get your backpack and go be

77
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:10,954
a regular below-average
student for six hours.

78
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:12,960
What a rip-off!

79
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:20,044
Ms. Schnur, do you have
a bobby pin I can borrow?

80
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,199
Like, this one?

81
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:23,570
I could probably spare that one.

82
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:25,595
Ooh, that's a nice paper clip.

83
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,620
- You've got taste, lady.
- Thank you.

84
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:32,109
Ms. Schnur, your nephew...
Has he done anything lately?

85
00:03:32,134 --> 00:03:34,014
Nathan? Oh, my God.

86
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,249
- Where to begin?
- Just begin.

87
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:37,789
He got into magic camp, this kid.

88
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:39,194
- Mmm.
- Not the sleepover one.

89
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,202
Uh, he's got some issues, but...

90
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:43,644
Hi, Teddy.

91
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:44,709
Why are you, um...

92
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:46,210
Do you...  do you need something?

93
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:47,444
No, uh, just watching.

94
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,269
Sometimes I pretend this
cutout is a TV screen

95
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:52,089
and I'm watching a cooking
show called Mustache Kitchen.

96
00:03:52,114 --> 00:03:53,824
- Ooh, I'd watch that.
- Uh...

97
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,155
I mean, they're-they're hit or miss,

98
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,560
but this episode's pretty good.

99
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:58,712
Bob's flipping burgers,
moving stuff around.

100
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:01,060
-Oh, my God.
-Where'd you learn your spatula technique?

101
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:03,714
I mean, is it all in the
wrist? Your delicate wrists?

102
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:05,409
Or the forearm? How do you do it?

103
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:08,439
I-I don't know. I mean, I don't
really, uh, think about it.

104
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:11,004
I just, uh, do it, I think.

105
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:12,239
Oops. Huh.

106
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:14,181
- Huh...  - Huh,
that's-that's weird.

107
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:16,724
All right, um, this
next flip will be fine.

108
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:18,764
Oh, crap, I broke that one in half.

109
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:20,039
Bob, what's going on?

110
00:04:20,064 --> 00:04:21,829
- What'd you do to those burgers?
- I don't know.

111
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:23,524
I was fine, then Teddy started asking me

112
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:25,144
stupid questions and got me...

113
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:26,330
- Not stupid.
- Thinking about it,

114
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:27,944
and now I can't flip a burger.

115
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:30,729
No, no, no, Teddy.
Don't ask Bob questions.

116
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:32,169
His brain's not built for that.

117
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:33,904
When I met him, he could tie a tie.

118
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:35,494
Then I asked him to show me how,

119
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:37,284
and he couldn't tie
a tie for five years.

120
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:40,084
Boy, this is a really
interesting Mustache Kitchen.

121
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:42,414
And then last month, Nathan entered

122
00:04:42,544 --> 00:04:43,914
the New Yorker caption contest...

123
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:45,544
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- And was robbed,

124
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:48,054
in my opinion and everyone's opinion.

125
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:50,264
- Cabinet of Confiscation.
- The winning one

126
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:53,004
- was not even good.
- Combination lock? No!

127
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:54,884
What are you doing in here?

128
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:57,054
I'm being the fricking principal.

129
00:04:57,184 --> 00:04:58,304
But you're not, though.

130
00:04:58,394 --> 00:04:59,530
My God, Spoors' private bathroom.

131
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:01,144
I've never seen the inside.

132
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:02,789
Spoors doesn't share his bathroom

133
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:05,434
with his poor secretary
with the shy bladder?

134
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:08,144
It's not my bladder. But no, he doesn't.

135
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:10,364
Ms. Schnur, I'm here. You're here.

136
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:13,089
The bathroom is here. And
Principal Spoors isn't.

137
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:15,938
So why don't you tell me
the combination to that lock?

138
00:05:15,963 --> 00:05:19,464
- Only Spoors knows it.
- Ugh! All right.

139
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:22,059
Pivoting to the rest of my agenda.

140
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:24,452
Ah. I would like some blank

141
00:05:24,477 --> 00:05:26,519
"from the office of the
principal" letterhead.

142
00:05:26,544 --> 00:05:28,829
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:31,860
How about you enjoy some
time in the private bathroom

144
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:34,765
while I enjoy some time cranking
out some very official memos.

145
00:05:34,964 --> 00:05:36,094
Everybody wins.

146
00:05:36,174 --> 00:05:37,764
The toilet loses.

147
00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:39,885
There's a stack of
letterhead in that drawer.

148
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,949
Looks like we've both
got some work to do.

149
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,854
See you on the other
side...  Principal Louise.

150
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,914
Check it out, peeps. New class schedule.

151
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:53,944
Straight from the principal's office.

152
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:56,614
Double recess? No more study hall?

153
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:59,104
How do you like our
educational system now, Norway?

154
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:02,838
And double lunch. Now I can chew
my food like I'm supposed to.

155
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,834
Wow. Louise is actually doing it.

156
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:06,414
If she's really gonna be the principal,

157
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,899
I'm gonna be the prance-able.

158
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:12,109
Now I can drive Uber for
15 minutes instead of ten.

159
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:13,544
Wh-What's all the hubbub?

160
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:15,324
Louise can't do this.

161
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:17,649
It's "from the office of the principal."

162
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:19,224
It looks official, right?

163
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:22,069
If we want it to, which we do.

164
00:06:22,094 --> 00:06:23,764
She's gone rogue.

165
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:26,619
- No prancing in the hall!
- Ah, boo.

166
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:28,119
Bob, we're getting

167
00:06:28,144 --> 00:06:29,064
a little behind here.

168
00:06:29,144 --> 00:06:30,774
This one guy's been waiting.

169
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,599
I'm running out of
excuses, so I told him

170
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:34,754
our regular chef is away
and you're his dumb twin.

171
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:36,424
I'm doing my best, Lin.

172
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:38,469
Damn it!

173
00:06:38,494 --> 00:06:40,354
Bob, I-I think I know what this is.

174
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,759
- You've got the yips.
- Yips? What are yips?

175
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:44,814
They're a mental block
that pro athletes get.

176
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,969
Like that baseball catcher
who got so in his head,

177
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:49,204
he couldn't even throw the
ball back to the pitcher.

178
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:51,899
He had to walk it back
while everyone booed.

179
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:53,609
Flip yips!

180
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:55,874
Flipping burgers is literally
the only thing I'm good at.

181
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:58,594
Teddy, what do those sports guys
with the yips do to get better?

182
00:06:58,634 --> 00:06:59,990
Oh, there's all kinds of therapies.

183
00:07:00,014 --> 00:07:02,764
They change their grip,
do breathing exercises,

184
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,029
hypnosis, but mostly
they retire in shame

185
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:06,354
'cause none of that stuff works.

186
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:08,224
Oh, crap.

187
00:07:08,314 --> 00:07:11,104
Ah...  I just came over here
for some peace and quiet.

188
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:14,499
My restaurant's packed and loud. Zoom!

189
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:17,444
- Go away, Jimmy.
- Yeah, go away. It's a bad time.

190
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:19,389
So, like, uh, every day?

191
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:21,144
Nothing's going on with
Bob, that's for sure.

192
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:23,469
Oh, yeah, Bob looks sweatier than usual.

193
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:25,124
What, is he having a baby back there?

194
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,494
- Bob's got the yips, Jimmy.
- Lin, stop.

195
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,519
He can't flip a burger,
but we still love him.

196
00:07:29,544 --> 00:07:31,504
Bob's got yips!

197
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:33,989
Like that, uh, catcher
I used to boo. Hilarious.

198
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:37,536
-Can I get a burger?
-Ooh, geez. I don't know. Can he, Bob?

199
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:39,419
Hey, yip yip yip yip yip yip
yip yip yip yip yip yip yip!

200
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:41,594
Yeah, you have the go-ahead.

201
00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:43,200
You can start building
the pool right away.

202
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:45,344
And we're gonna go
with three crazy slides.

203
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:46,934
I don't want sane slides.

204
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:49,104
Okay, Principal Louise. Fun's over.

205
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:51,814
Uh, my office hours aren't
till this afternoon, Phillip.

206
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:53,334
Oh, I guess I could come back...  No!

207
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:55,104
What am I saying? Get out of that chair.

208
00:07:55,194 --> 00:07:58,064
Why don't you have a lollipop
and we'll talk this over.

209
00:07:58,154 --> 00:08:00,234
Talking it over, no. Lollipop, yes.

210
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:02,654
Well, I'm not budging
from this seat, so...

211
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,969
Just roll with it, Louise.

212
00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:07,324
Damn it. This is lime, not sour apple.

213
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:11,059
You're not supposed
to go in that bathroom.

214
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:12,954
- How was it?
- Paradise.

215
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:14,439
Where's Principal Louise?

216
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:16,254
There is no Principal Louise.

217
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,989
Attention, faculty and students.

218
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:21,189
This is Principal Louise.
Recess is now tripled.

219
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:23,070
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

220
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:24,134
Louise, what if...

221
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:26,024
- we turn PE into...
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

222
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:29,579
Oh, and PE will now be
sensual reggae dance hour.

223
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:30,494
Mm!

224
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:32,789
Ooh, Louise, can it be Wacky Hat Day?

225
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:34,790
Oh, it's just that, Gene,
where are people supposed

226
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,234
to get hats on short notice?

227
00:08:36,314 --> 00:08:37,694
Please give me this!

228
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:41,444
- It's Wacky Hat Day.
- Yes!

229
00:08:41,484 --> 00:08:44,654
- Louise, Mr. Frond is coming.
- Also, Mr. Frond has hidden

230
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:46,624
a five-dollar bill in his shoe.

231
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:49,164
First student to get it out
of there can take it home!

232
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:52,664
- I don't have money in my shoes!
- Give it to me!

233
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:55,804
She's getting away!

234
00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:59,464
New policy. Henceforth, all
teachers have to speak...

235
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:02,424
"Have to speak with an
Italian accent." Cool.

236
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:05,859
"Passing notes is allowed."
Nice. That's my medium.

237
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:09,320
"Gum chewing is now a class."
Oh, my God, I might graduate.

238
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:11,949
First lunch is over.

239
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:15,184
Second lunch begins. Bon appetoots!

240
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:19,104
♪ ♪

241
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:21,364
Attention! All tetherballs 
shall be untethered

242
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:24,697
- and set free!
- It's chaos.

243
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:26,283
_

244
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:28,284
I'm Tammy, and I'm here with Louise,

245
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:30,334
our popular Principal for a Day.

246
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:33,084
I'm also popular. Did you
think I would ever talk to you?

247
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:36,809
Of course I hoped not, Tammy,
but I'm everyone's principal.

248
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,649
Hmm. Jocelyn is in the hall,

249
00:09:38,674 --> 00:09:40,384
getting some reactions to your day.

250
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:41,949
I'm passing some of my best notes.

251
00:09:42,094 --> 00:09:45,054
Yeah, Zeke's on fire. Highly quotable.

252
00:09:45,174 --> 00:09:47,304
Wacky Hat Day has been a huge success,

253
00:09:47,384 --> 00:09:48,804
despite what you might have heard!

254
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:50,434
The scores on the quiz I gave today

255
00:09:50,514 --> 00:09:51,934
were the highest of the year.

256
00:09:52,014 --> 00:09:54,684
I think the extra recess
really helped the kids focus.

257
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:56,404
- What did I get?
- Let's talk off the air.

258
00:09:56,484 --> 00:09:57,494
Oh.

259
00:10:00,194 --> 00:10:01,944
The news studio.

260
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:04,839
You can't go in there. The light is on.

261
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:06,324
Ah! I've got you! I...

262
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:08,379
Where's Louise? She was just on TV.

263
00:10:08,404 --> 00:10:10,064
She left already. We're not live.

264
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:12,219
We're, like, on a delay,
in case kids swear.

265
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,624
- Damn it!
- Yeah, like that.

266
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:16,084
You know what, Schnur?

267
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:18,454
I kind of got into this
principal thing for myself,

268
00:10:18,544 --> 00:10:22,214
but I feel like I'm actually
helping people? Is that crazy?

269
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:24,109
The amount you
have done in one day.

270
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:26,804
- And the amount you've done.
- Thank you.

271
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:29,094
Hey-oh. Looking for Principal Spoors.

272
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:31,024
- You're not him.
- No, I am not.

273
00:10:31,054 --> 00:10:32,514
I know that because you're a kid.

274
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:34,724
And because Principal
Spoors is my brother-in-law.

275
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:37,694
- Who is that?
- I'm Don, the new guidance counselor.

276
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:40,789
But we already have a
guidance counselor, Mr. Frond.

277
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, that's probably
the guy getting fired

278
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:43,274
so I can have his job.

279
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:45,094
Mr. Frond's getting fired?

280
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,129
Am I dreaming?

281
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:47,864
You're real, right?

282
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:50,943
- Oh, I try to keep it real.
- Yeah, you do.

283
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:55,482
So you're Principal
Spoors' brother-in-law?

284
00:10:55,507 --> 00:10:58,124
Yeah. He married my sister.
Or I married his sister.

285
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:00,545
Anyway, one of those sisters
nagged him into giving me a job.

286
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:04,083
Oy, Spoors always picks days
he's out for people to be fired.

287
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:06,424
Then he makes me do it. Wimp.

288
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:08,739
You're gonna fire Mr. Frond right now?

289
00:11:08,764 --> 00:11:10,974
Can, uh, I watch?

290
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:13,474
First, Mr. Frond has to
give Don his orientation.

291
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:16,119
The fired person
orients the hired person

292
00:11:16,144 --> 00:11:18,144
before they know they're fired.

293
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:19,999
You get a much better
orienting that way.

294
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:21,814
Yeah, I can see that.

295
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:23,169
Hi, Mr. Frond.

296
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:24,354
This is Don.

297
00:11:24,444 --> 00:11:26,114
He is joining our counseling department,

298
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:28,589
and that's all I'm gonna
say about that for now.

299
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:30,614
Finally, some help around here.

300
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,430
I've been begging
Principal Spoors for months.

301
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:34,021
Yo-boy.

302
00:11:34,046 --> 00:11:36,044
Okay, I'm gonna have to
orient you quickly, Don,

303
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:38,204
because I'm dealing with a
bit of an emergency today.

304
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:39,954
Any questions before we get started?

305
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:42,254
Yes. Should I be paying attention,

306
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:44,174
or is it enough if I
nod every now and then

307
00:11:44,254 --> 00:11:45,334
like I'm getting it?

308
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:47,504
- Um, pay attention?
- Mm-hmm.

309
00:11:47,594 --> 00:11:51,014
Look at him. Mr. Frond
has no idea what's going on.

310
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:52,804
He's orienting his own executioner.

311
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:54,634
Like the old Domino's Pizza crust

312
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:57,344
teaching the new Domino's
Pizza crust how to be crusty.

313
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,079
So now's our chance to bust

314
00:11:59,104 --> 00:12:01,564
the Cabinet of Confiscation wide open.

315
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,009
Forget combinations. We
need overwhelming force.

316
00:12:05,154 --> 00:12:08,684
Ah, Mr. Branca. Do you have
a crowbar we could borrow?

317
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,129
A personal crowbar or a work crowbar?

318
00:12:11,154 --> 00:12:13,864
Beware, my personal crowbar is haunted.

319
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:15,494
Okay, your work crowbar, then.

320
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:17,204
Oh, I got that one downstairs.

321
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:19,059
- Can we go get it?
- No, it's here.

322
00:12:19,084 --> 00:12:21,414
"Downstairs" is what I call my pants.

323
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:22,979
Crap!

324
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:24,784
Stupid! No, no!

325
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:26,979
Can I interest you in
the Burger of the Day?

326
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:28,190
- Oh, double crap!
- It's...  fries.

327
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,424
Wait! I did it!

328
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:31,314
Lin! I figured it out! Come see!

329
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:32,844
- Oh, thank God.
- Yay, Bobby!

330
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:34,394
It's just a little bit different.

331
00:12:34,514 --> 00:12:36,684
I slide the spatula under
the burger like normal.

332
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:38,054
Sure, right.

333
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:40,054
Then I bring in the second spatula.

334
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:41,434
Second spatula?

335
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,879
And I kind of push it
from one to the other.

336
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,064
Then I rest for a sec. Whew.

337
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:49,129
Then I turn the handle
of both spatulas...

338
00:12:49,154 --> 00:12:52,644
Delicate...  Ta-da!
Well? What do you think?

339
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:55,129
It makes me feel...  sorry for you?

340
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,074
It's kind of the burger-man equivalent

341
00:12:57,099 --> 00:12:58,969
of walking the ball back
to the pitcher, right?

342
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:00,874
-You think I don't know that, Teddy?!
-Aah!

343
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:02,494
Something's wrong with my brain!

344
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,269
It's a very simple task,
and I'm not even close.

345
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:07,424
I'm broken! And you did this!

346
00:13:07,504 --> 00:13:09,214
You did this, Teddy!

347
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:10,829
Bob, Bob, Bob, hey.

348
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:13,774
- Easy. Come here.
- Oh! Hold me!

349
00:13:13,844 --> 00:13:16,384
There, there. There he is. Ow! Ow!

350
00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:17,974
Easy with those spatulas!

351
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:20,094
It's slow, but I think
we're getting there.

352
00:13:20,144 --> 00:13:22,104
That's the name of my one-man show.

353
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:24,974
So how about I take all
the truly messed-up kids

354
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,984
and you tackle Peter Pescadero?

355
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:28,944
He's got a weird belly button,

356
00:13:28,984 --> 00:13:31,064
and about every three
weeks or so, a kid sees it.

357
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:32,420
I don't know. My belly button's perfect,

358
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,074
and he might sense that.

359
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:36,904
Ms. Schnur will take your
picture for your I.D. card.

360
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:38,889
And that completes your orientation.

361
00:13:38,914 --> 00:13:40,619
Oy. So, Mr. Frond...

362
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:42,179
What's that?

363
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:45,204
Louise! The Cabinet of Confiscation!

364
00:13:45,254 --> 00:13:48,094
- Mr. Branca's work crowbar!
- Did you do it?

365
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,268
Not yet. I was just in my windup.

366
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:53,004
- Do what?
- Aw, you poor, poor man.

367
00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:54,754
Poor me? Poor you!

368
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:56,124
All right, I'm just gonna say it.

369
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:57,804
Don is here to replace you.

370
00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:00,134
Nice try. Don is completely unqualified.

371
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:02,014
That's not what my mom says.

372
00:14:02,144 --> 00:14:03,894
Damn it, I meant to say "your mom."

373
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:06,414
Mr. Frond, Ms. Schnur's gonna
ask you to take a walk with her.

374
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:07,581
No, she's not.

375
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:09,379
Let's take a little walk, Mr. Frond.

376
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:10,954
Seriously?

377
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:13,484
That's how I feel any time
I have to walk anywhere.

378
00:14:13,614 --> 00:14:16,034
- But I love my job.
- Ew.

379
00:14:16,114 --> 00:14:17,364
Fine.

380
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:20,114
Make sure Eli gets his placebo Ritalin.

381
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:21,704
It's, uh, a raisin.

382
00:14:21,744 --> 00:14:23,374
If Jessica gets ragey before lunch,

383
00:14:23,454 --> 00:14:26,204
it's just low blood
sugar. Give her a raisin.

384
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:27,874
Mr. Frond will be okay, right?

385
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:30,014
He could probably do with some time off.

386
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:31,874
And Don, he's gonna
work out great for us

387
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:33,044
as a guidance counselor.

388
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:34,884
He's dumb, and he doesn't give a crap.

389
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:37,344
Unlike Mr. Phillip
"Cares Too Much" Frond.

390
00:14:37,464 --> 00:14:39,014
I've never heard his full name.

391
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:41,054
- It's pretty.
- He's always busting his butt,

392
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:43,514
doing his best to actually counsel kids,

393
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:46,114
the big, dopey son of a...

394
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:49,234
I don't feel as great 
about this as I want to.

395
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:50,984
Whew. I'm glad to hear you say that.

396
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:53,345
It's kind of what I was feeling,
but you're the principal,

397
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:55,004
and I guess I'm
intimidated by authority.

398
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:57,441
I was totally on the same page, too.

399
00:14:57,466 --> 00:14:59,014
Uh, glad you both finally came around.

400
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,089
Huh, something's written
on a piece of tape

401
00:15:01,114 --> 00:15:02,164
on the back of this lock.

402
00:15:02,204 --> 00:15:03,874
"One, one, one, one."

403
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,519
He wrote the combination
on the back of the lock?

404
00:15:06,544 --> 00:15:08,094
And we never turned the lock over?

405
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,443
And he couldn't remember
"one, one, one, one"?

406
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:16,107
It's everything we ever dreamed of.

407
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:18,134
- Whoopee cushions.
- Cans of Jolt.

408
00:15:18,214 --> 00:15:20,674
Rubber snake. Oh, no,
that's a dead real one.

409
00:15:20,804 --> 00:15:22,434
Guys, listen.

410
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:25,029
We can either have the
best afternoon of our lives

411
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:27,814
playing with this stuff,
or we can save Frond's job

412
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:30,144
while I'm still principal.
There's not time to do both.

413
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:31,994
Can I at least make the dead snake

414
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,040
- sit on the whoopee cushion?
- All right, real quick.

415
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:36,341
Okay, let's go.

416
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,576
Principal Spoors
comes back tomorrow.

417
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:44,787
So we've only got to the end
of the day to make Don gone.

418
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:46,716
It's almost 2:00.
There's no time to waste.

419
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:49,254
Wait. Wasting time.
That gives me an idea.

420
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,983
What's the biggest time
waster of all at school?

421
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:54,498
That thing I do where I take
all my pencils to the bathroom

422
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:55,943
and give them each a little bath?

423
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:57,468
No, assemblies.

424
00:15:57,493 --> 00:16:00,535
As principal, I'll
call a special assembly

425
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,863
to give Frond a fond farewell.

426
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:04,768
A Frond-well, for short.

427
00:16:04,793 --> 00:16:06,453
And to welcome the
new guidance counselor.

428
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:08,548
Oh, my God, that sounds like...

429
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:10,913
just a super thoughtful thing to do?

430
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,778
It won't be thoughtful.

431
00:16:12,923 --> 00:16:14,963
But it will be super.

432
00:16:14,988 --> 00:16:18,108
Okay, sounding more ominous
now, the way you said it.

433
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:21,144
Bob, Linda! I think I got it!

434
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:23,223
- What? What, Teddy?
- All Bob can think of

435
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,068
is how he's gonna mess up the burger.

436
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:28,262
So he does! He needs something
else to fill his brain.

437
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,537
Like that baseball
movie with Kevin Costner.

438
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:32,562
- Oh, yeah, Bill Durham.
- Bull.

439
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:34,757
Don't say that till
you hear the idea, Bob.

440
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:37,047
No. The mo...  the char...  Forget it.

441
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:39,312
So, not Bill Durham, but
the other guy, the pitcher,

442
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:40,537
was crazy wild.

443
00:16:40,562 --> 00:16:41,982
So to take his mind off it,

444
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:43,153
that lady gave him her underwear.

445
00:16:43,177 --> 00:16:44,837
Bob's not wearing my underwear.

446
00:16:44,862 --> 00:16:46,862
I got them stretched out
just the way I like them.

447
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:49,231
No, no. You don't have
to wear Linda's underwear.

448
00:16:49,256 --> 00:16:51,388
-Okay.
-I'm talking about Jimmy's Pesto's.

449
00:16:51,435 --> 00:16:53,904
Oh, my God. Wait. How did you get those?

450
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,672
I bribed his bartender
Trev to sneak them out

451
00:16:55,742 --> 00:16:57,122
of Jimmy's gym bag.

452
00:16:57,147 --> 00:16:59,607
Now I got to build Trev a
pretty intricate doghouse.

453
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:01,058
Well, I'm not wearing those, either.

454
00:17:01,082 --> 00:17:02,542
Bob, you gotta try.

455
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,487
Put that Pesto in your
pants. It's our only hope.

456
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:06,357
Are they clean?

457
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:09,357
They are not.

458
00:17:09,382 --> 00:17:11,932
Hi. Acting Principal Louise here.

459
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:15,972
You're welcome. As you may have heard,

460
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:18,852
Mr. Frond is leaving the
school he's been at forever.

461
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:21,827
He's the pest in the vest
who's always distressed.

462
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:23,982
He's Mr. Frond. A few words?

463
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:27,717
Uh, I'm disappointed but undaunted.

464
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:30,612
So, tomorrow, I get up, get dressed,

465
00:17:30,637 --> 00:17:33,277
blank space, blank
space, go to bed early.

466
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,422
Oh, my God, I have no idea what to do.

467
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:36,912
Except keep it from Mother.

468
00:17:36,992 --> 00:17:39,269
- Hot mic, Mr. F.!
- Huh? Oh, yes.

469
00:17:39,294 --> 00:17:41,212
I-I'm gonna go pack up my office.

470
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,712
That zen garden isn't gonna travel well.

471
00:17:43,737 --> 00:17:45,817
Now let's meet our
new guidance counselor.

472
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:48,302
Don. Where do you guys go to school?

473
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:50,676
Oh. Here. Right.

474
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,340
Jokes. Thank you. Good night.

475
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:54,262
Don, since you're up
here, maybe you could take

476
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:55,942
a few counseling
questions from students?

477
00:17:56,052 --> 00:17:58,002
Oh, I don't think anybody
wants to, uh, hear...

478
00:17:58,027 --> 00:17:59,907
- We got one here, Don.
- Okay.

479
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:02,482
My hamster got killed by our Roomba,

480
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:04,394
and I'm having trouble moving on.

481
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:07,022
Young girl's first
experience with death. Don?

482
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:09,507
Uh...  I'll have to come
back to that, I think.

483
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:12,151
Young man here has a
question about puberty.

484
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:14,677
Ever since I started
getting hair on my...

485
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:16,468
You know what? Let's go back
to the, uh, hamster girl.

486
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:17,678
I have one over here, Don.

487
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:19,162
A friend of mine is asthmatic,

488
00:18:19,187 --> 00:18:20,977
and his parents are divorced.

489
00:18:21,002 --> 00:18:23,292
He's wondering if maybe
it's the asthma's fault?

490
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,147
- Uh...  yeah, maybe.
- What?

491
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:28,112
My brothers are twins,
but there's only one of me,

492
00:18:28,137 --> 00:18:30,857
and it feels like a rip-off.
Where's my twin, Don?

493
00:18:30,882 --> 00:18:32,012
Where's my twin?

494
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:33,842
I'm right here, Jay-Ju. I got you.

495
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:35,432
You don't look like me!

496
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:37,392
Not a criteria for friendship. I get it.

497
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:39,432
Can I...  can I get a glass
of some water, please?

498
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:41,932
We're a school, not a
five-star restaurant, Don.

499
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:45,092
He was lying there
with his little legs in the air.

500
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:47,247
Just like when I found Grandpa.

501
00:18:47,272 --> 00:18:50,692
Why does everything die?

502
00:18:50,717 --> 00:18:53,722
You know, I think...  mic...  cut out...

503
00:18:53,747 --> 00:18:55,547
Uh, no. Mic's working fine for me.

504
00:18:55,572 --> 00:18:57,662
All right, Don, answer the questions.

505
00:18:57,687 --> 00:19:00,715
How's banana hands doing? Zoom!

506
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:03,362
Show's over, Jimmy. Bob got yip therapy.

507
00:19:03,387 --> 00:19:05,057
Yeah, right.

508
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:06,712
No, Jimmy, I'm back.

509
00:19:06,752 --> 00:19:08,082
Square in the middle of the grill.

510
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:09,777
- That's my Bobby.
- Fluke.

511
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:12,262
Fluke you, Jimmy. Bob's all better.

512
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:14,947
- And it's thanks to you, pal.
- Thanks to me.

513
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:17,122
You helped me in a very intimate way.

514
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:18,737
Don't say "intimate." Come on.

515
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:20,012
You eating? It's on me.

516
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:21,747
The burgers are on me.

517
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:23,578
I'm not talking about
something else being on me.

518
00:19:23,602 --> 00:19:24,812
But I...  could.

519
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:26,062
You know, you're being weird.

520
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:28,062
If I wanted weird, I'd listen to Trev

521
00:19:28,087 --> 00:19:30,127
talk about some crazy
doghouse he's getting.

522
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:33,007
I've enjoyed our brief time, Jimmy.

523
00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:35,192
Go back to underwear you came from.

524
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,062
Stop saying things I-I don't get.

525
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,479
I'm leaving. Have fun
with your stupid words.

526
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:40,492
Bye.

527
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:42,702
Hey, Bob. Any way I could
get a turn in those things?

528
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:43,978
I got to fix a roof tomorrow.

529
00:19:44,002 --> 00:19:45,662
I could use any help I could get.

530
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,082
- Mmm...
- Aw, Bob, let Teddy wear 'em.

531
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:49,397
He's gonna do a roof.

532
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,842
All right. But I want them back.

533
00:19:51,882 --> 00:19:52,938
- You're the one who copies me.
- You copy me, Jocelyn.

534
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:54,737
Sorry. Who had brown
hair until she met me

535
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:56,408
-and now she's blonde?
-I'd have to look at you to copy you.

536
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:58,278
-I don't even like to look at you. Whatever.
-Whatever.

537
00:19:58,302 --> 00:20:00,012
Best friends in crisis. Don?

538
00:20:00,052 --> 00:20:03,566
I...  I left...  an ice
cream cake in my trunk.

539
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:06,522
All right. It's not a friend.

540
00:20:06,602 --> 00:20:08,232
It's me.

541
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:11,272
Good assembly. Did Peter
Pescadero confess to a crime?

542
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:13,651
Ah. Don just quit.

543
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:15,087
Says a tree fell on him.

544
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:16,956
- Aw.
- Great, great.

545
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:18,232
Now let's find Mr. Frond.

546
00:20:18,257 --> 00:20:20,297
He left the assembly early. Come on.

547
00:20:20,322 --> 00:20:23,401
- Mr. Frond, stop.
- Not now, Louise.

548
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:25,832
I just want to go home and
get in the bath with my cats.

549
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,437
We've got a major situation.

550
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:29,767
- Don quit.
- What? He did?

551
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:31,992
So the school needs
a guidance counselor.

552
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:34,331
I'm only gonna be principal
for three more minutes.

553
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:36,857
I want the last thing I
do to be hiring you back.

554
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:39,382
You have no authority to
offer me a job, Louise.

555
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,515
- Hmm, in that case...
- I accept. Thank God.

556
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,827
Good negotiation.

557
00:20:42,852 --> 00:20:44,908
Maybe you should've asked
for a better parking place?

558
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:46,892
Come on. Let's move you
back into your office.

559
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:49,037
It's a good thing you didn't
grab all your stuff yet.

560
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,200
- This is all my stuff.
- Oh.

561
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:53,152
You know, Louise, as a principal today,

562
00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:55,398
you were actually pretty good.

563
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,717
Thanks, Mr. Frond.

564
00:20:56,742 --> 00:20:58,702
You're pretty good. For noticing that.

565
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:01,007
Whoops! It's fine. Don't look.

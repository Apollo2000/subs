Okay! Okay! Can everyone hear me? Hello?

12
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,345
Thanks, everyone, for helping
us celebrate Marcus' birthday.

13
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,548
As a special birthday
surprise for you, Marcus,

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,284
we got you your favorite entertainer.

15
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:56,087
Everyone, please
welcome Chuck E. Cheese!

16
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,458
Hey... Check. Check.

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,628
Yes! Yes!

18
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:10,568
Thanks... celeb... Marcus' birthday...

19
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,969
What's wrong with him?

20
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,672
Can't you tell? He's
high on painkillers!

21
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,308
Ugh. Ugh. Hold on.

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,477
Shit.

23
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,181
Okay, let's... Let's do this.

All right, kids...

26
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,498
Uh, why don't we head back
to the party and cut the cake?

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,799
I don't want cake!

28
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:44,552
Who could eat cake at a time like this?!

29
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,471
Another drug overdose?

30
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:49,706
Most likely.

31
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,307
Percocet and OxyContin

32
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:53,442
found wrapped in his cheese cloth.

33
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:55,745
Prescription drugs but
with no prescription.

34
00:01:55,747 --> 00:01:58,715
You guys know where all these
illegal meds are coming from?

35
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:00,583
Most likely from the prisons.

36
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:02,251
Whenever there's a drug epidemic,

37
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:04,286
you can usually trace it
back to people who've been

38
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:07,423
thrown away by society
and forgotten about.

39
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:28,409
Can I help you?

40
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:29,978
Yeah, I'm here to visit my grandpa.

41
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,813
Oh, how nice of you.

42
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:34,716
All right. Arms in the air.

43
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:36,852
What's the present?

44
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:38,319
Just some Hummels.

45
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:39,654
More Hummels?

46
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:42,089
Why are senior citizens so infatuated

47
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:44,325
with these little German statues?

48
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:47,362
All right. Go on. You got 10 minutes.

49
00:02:59,608 --> 00:03:02,542
- Grandpa?
- Billy!

50
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:04,478
Finally you're here to visit.

51
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,914
Did you bring grandpa a present?

52
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,916
Yeah I got what you wanted.

53
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:14,254
Aw, Merry Wanderer and Happy Traveler?

54
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:15,889
These Hummels suck!

55
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:17,123
That's what the guy gave me!

56
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,858
It's okay, Billy.

57
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,894
I'm just gonna need you
to deliver another one

58
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:23,297
of Ms. McGullicutty's crochet pillows.

You don't understand
how it works in here!

62
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,404
Ms. McGullicutty is top bitch.

63
00:03:31,406 --> 00:03:35,842

Again?!

Dude, how many crappy crochet pillows
do you have to give out for him?

72
00:04:02,736 --> 00:04:04,402
I don't know. It's what he wants.

73
00:04:04,404 --> 00:04:06,271
I feel bad for him, all
right? I think he's miserable.

74
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:07,772
He's old. He's supposed to be miserable.

75
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:09,407
Look, I just got to make
this exchange for him

oh, I think this is her now.

00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:22,420
Cool. Do you have the Hummel?

87
00:04:36,002 --> 00:04:37,801
Old people love Hummels, dude.

88
00:04:40,673 --> 00:04:42,907
Students, faculty, and staff,

89
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:45,776
today, we are facing an epidemic
of catastrophic proportions.

90
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:47,578
I know I am not alone
in mourning the loss

91
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,081
of one our greatest
entertainers, Chuck E. Cheese.

92
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,450
Had we known the personal
hell he was going through,

93
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:54,852
perhaps we could have helped.

94
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:56,353
But too many were more than eager

95
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:58,221
to supply Chuck E. With the opioids

96
00:04:58,223 --> 00:04:59,956
that caused his untimely death.

97
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,125
Chuck E. was not the first
entertainer in our community

98
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:03,527
to die from this epidemic.

99
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:05,295
Let us not forget

100
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:06,530
Dinkie Dook the clown,

101
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:08,064
dead of a Roxanol overdose

102
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:10,666
at Tommy Schneider's
bar mitzvah last March,

103
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:12,435
Shimmer and Shine, who both collapsed

104
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,704
from massive amounts of
oxycodone in their systems

105
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:16,907

106
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:19,342
Spiderman, cut down in
his prime by Demerol,

107
00:05:19,344 --> 00:05:21,544
and just recently, Swiper the Fox,

108
00:05:21,546 --> 00:05:26,048
dead of multiple opioids found
inside his crochet pillow.

109
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,518
How many more entertainers must we lose

110
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,052
before we take action?!

111
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:34,023
It is time to declare war
on opioids in our society!

112
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:41,696
Dude, what the fuck, Stan?!

113
00:05:41,698 --> 00:05:43,665
I didn't know, all right?!

114
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,534
You didn't know you were
slinging drugs for your grandpa?

115
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:47,336
It didn't occur to me as a possibility.

116
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:48,770
Dude, did you hear everyone in school?

117
00:05:48,772 --> 00:05:50,239
They're coming after you.

118
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:51,473
You killed Swiper the Fox,

119
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:52,942
and we were standing there with you!

120
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:55,644
You got to tell people we
had no idea what was going on!

121
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,446
I had no idea what was going on!

122
00:05:57,448 --> 00:05:58,914
Hey, fellas!

123
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:03,117
Boy, that Marcus kid
is on the warpath, huh?

124
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,519
He's really motivated.

125
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:06,269
I mean, screw that kid,
but I guess it's good

126
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:09,791
somebody's finally doing something
about these goddamn drug dealers.

127
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,830
Well, see ya, fellas!

128
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:21,102
Our only way out is to
go to the police right now

129
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:22,670
and turn Stan's grandpa in!

130
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:24,272
No, we don't have to do that.

131
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:26,907
Let me go talk to him.
I can put a stop to this.

132
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:28,709
Grandpa, what the hell
have you gotten me into?

133
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:30,611
Shh! Quiet, they'll hear you!

134
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:33,013
There were drugs in the
crochet pillow, weren't there?

135
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:34,381
Do you know people are dying?!

136
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:35,950
What do you want me to do, Billy?

137
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:38,118
You see Mrs. McGullicutty over there?

138
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,187
Whoever has the best Hummel collection

139
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:43,858
is top bitch in this place,
and she's got the best.

140
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,560
She's ruthless, and she
has those old lady farts.

141
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:49,229
You know old lady farts, right?

142
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:52,165
Where they're so loose they don't
even acknowledge they happened?

143
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,334
Oh, hello, Mr. Marsh.

144
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:59,139
Ah! Mrs. McGullicutty.
How are you feeling today?

145
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:00,907
I'm doing very well.

146
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:04,744
Have they given you Percocet
for that knee of yours?

147
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:07,179
Oh, uh, yeah, here. I just got it.

148
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:08,447
Here you go.

149
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:09,816
Oh, you'd almost think

150
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:12,084
you were trying to keep them from me.

151
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:14,721
Oh, uh, ma'am?

152
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:16,355
My grandpa actually
really needs those drugs.

153
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:17,657
He's in a lot of pain.

154
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:19,858
Ooh, and who is this little rascal?

155
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,561
That's just my grandson.
He... He's worthless.

156
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:24,263
How sweet.

157
00:07:24,265 --> 00:07:27,466
Hmm? Coming to visit your
old papa in the joint, huh?

158
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:29,701
You love your papa, don't you?

159
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:34,840
You'd hate to see him suffer
even more than he already is.

160
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:36,808
You watch your ass, Marsh,

161
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,578
or I'll have you sent to the quiet room.

162
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,950
Wh... What is she talking
about? What's the quiet room?

163
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:47,385
I told you... She has
all the pull in here.

164
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:51,523
You go against what she
says, you end up in solitaire.

165
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:54,192
No. No, please! I-I didn't do anything!

166
00:07:54,194 --> 00:07:55,626
It's all right, Mr. Standish.

167
00:07:55,628 --> 00:07:57,128
You just need a little quiet time.

168
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,865
I don't even know how to
play solitaire! Please!

169
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:06,204
I understand that, today, they are
performing Chuck E. Cheese's autopsy?

170
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:08,373
Oh the kid's party performer, yeah.

171
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,075
As a concerned member of the
public, I wish to be present.

172
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:14,478
Uh, sorry, children aren't
really allowed in autopsies.

173
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,814
Then I shall wait here to
learn the coroner's findings!

174
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:18,883
Toxicology report shows subject

175
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:22,019
had massive amounts of opioids
in system at time of death.

176
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:24,722
Now proceeding.

177
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:36,366
Have these put in the garbage.

178
00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:37,767
What did you find, coroner?

179
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:39,035
Who is this?

180
00:08:39,037 --> 00:08:41,371
There is an epidemic
in our community, sir!

181
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:43,406
Some of us actually care
to confront the problem.

182
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:45,108
Now, damn it, what did you find?

183
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,843
Nothing out of the ordinary.

184
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:48,845
The subject died of a simple overdose.

185
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:51,214
We found nothing else
except for two Hummels

186
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:53,182
in the subject's rectal cavity.

187
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:55,351
Hummels? In his rectal cavity, you say,

188
00:08:55,353 --> 00:08:57,621
and you do not find this
'out of the ordinary'?

189
00:08:57,623 --> 00:08:58,887
Not at all.

190
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:00,323
We've found Hummels in nearly all

191
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:02,091
the birthday entertainer's
anal cavities.

192
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:04,560
It's very common in
our overdose victims.

193
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:05,861
Hmm...

194
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:07,896
A bit too common, don't you think?

195
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:14,403
Guys, why does grandpa have
to be in the nursing home?

196
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:15,638
Can't he live with us again?

197
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,405
Stan, grandpa has a lot of needs

198
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:19,341
that we can't provide him here.

199
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:21,243
He needs professional supervision.

200
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:24,715
Is that really it? Because I-I just
feel like we kind of threw grandpa away

201
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,857
- and forgot about him.
- Oh, really?

202
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:28,517
Do you have any idea
how much money we pay

203
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,452
to have grandpa in that place?

204
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:32,487
Your grandpa is styling.

205
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,856
Can you imagine being able
to just sit around all day

206
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:37,125
and not have to do anything
but eat and watch TV?

207
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:39,427
Yeah, I'd probably go crazy
and want to kill myself.

208
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:41,796
Jesus, Stan, it's not like he's in jail.

209
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:43,365
Yeah, it's kind of like jail.

210
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:44,599
You should go visit him.

211
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:45,634
I can't.

212
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:47,202
I'm too busy busting my ass

213
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:48,636
to pay the bills for that place

214
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:50,604
and to pay for your guitar lessons.

215
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:52,273
I don't have guitar lessons.

216
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:54,876
I don't want to go
there. It's depressing.

217
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:57,745
Aw, you tricked me.

218
00:09:57,747 --> 00:09:59,480
Hello?

219
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:02,216
Dude! Did you give Butters
a crochet pillow to drop off?

220
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:04,152
Dude, I don't have a choice.

221
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:05,819
I have to get the
Hummels for my grandpa.

222
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:07,154
Well, you need to get Hummels

223
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:09,323
without making Butters a drug dealer.

224
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:10,724
Drug dealer?!

225
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:11,958
All right. All right.

226
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,628

Hey, we have this week's
delivery of medications.

259
00:11:27,576 --> 00:11:28,542
Bring 'em in!

260
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:45,059
Aah!

261
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:46,460
Hello, Mr. Marsh.

262
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:47,861
Oh, he-hey, Marcus.

263
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:49,229
I understand you've become

264
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:51,165
quite the Hummel collector lately.

265
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,900
What's the fascination with Hummels?

266
00:11:53,902 --> 00:11:57,104
Nothing. I... Look, I just
really like Hummels, okay?

267
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:58,339
I'm just... I'm really into Hummels.

268
00:11:58,341 --> 00:12:00,941
Ah. I see. So then you should be able

269
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:03,610
to tell me what this Hummel is called.

270
00:12:03,612 --> 00:12:04,811
That... That's, uh...

271
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:07,481
Come on! If you're a Hummel expert,
then you should know it's name!

272
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:09,483
It's... It's Whistling in the Rain.

273
00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:12,285
Wrong! It's called Stormy Weather.

274
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:15,421
- Do you know where it was found?
- No.

275
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:19,592
It was found deep in the
anus of one Chuck E. Cheese,

276
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:21,694
the renowned entertainer
beloved by millions!

277
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:24,197
If you know something about the epidemic

278
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:27,066
that is killing artists,
then you better cough it up.

279
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:29,768
Marcus, trust me, you
don't want to get involved.

280
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,871
I became involved when Chuck E. Cheese

281
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:34,974
collapsed like a rag
doll before my very eyes!

282
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:39,114
If you had any involvement,
I will bring you down!

283
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:48,053
Well, it was really
great seeing you, Dad.

284
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:50,088
Guess we oughta hit the road soon.

285
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,757
You finally come to visit
and leave after 10 minutes.

286
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,126
Oh, Jesus, now we know

287
00:12:54,128 --> 00:12:56,228
where Stan gets his guilt trips from.

288
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,629
Mmmm.

289
00:12:57,631 --> 00:13:01,266
It seems somebody's been
a little naughty lately.

290
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:04,569
Oh, Mrs. McGullicutty,

291
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:05,603
how are you?

292
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:07,071
Mmmm.

293
00:13:07,073 --> 00:13:09,774
My, what a lovely Hummel collection

294
00:13:09,776 --> 00:13:11,342
you're starting to amass.

295
00:13:13,212 --> 00:13:17,749
Almost smells brand new, doesn't it?

296
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:20,785
Like it was purchased
right from the factory.

297
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:26,157
Ooh, and who are these lovely people?

298
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,427
Family that came to visit, no doubt?

299
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:32,029
Yes. Yeah, we love coming here.

300
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,997
Ah, family.

301
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:36,333
I remember when I was a little girl.

302
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,870
My brother used to
play such tricks on me.

303
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:42,238
Try to fool me.

304
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,742
Try to get out from
his responsibilities.

305
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:47,110
I'm giving you Hummels.

306
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:48,845
What's it matter where they come from?

307
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:50,480
Oh.

308
00:13:50,482 --> 00:13:54,150
It doesn't matter to me,
but it matters to them.

309
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:56,319
The big guys.

310
00:13:56,321 --> 00:14:01,091
You see, what they want is
more people who are addicted.

311
00:14:01,093 --> 00:14:02,992
To crochet pillows.

312
00:14:02,994 --> 00:14:05,128
Got it?

313
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,830
Nice to meet you fine folks.

314
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:10,500
We're never visiting here again.

315
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:15,137
Oh, ho! You're dead, Butters!

316
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:16,639
Aw, geez.

317
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:18,140
Guys! Guys, I need your help!

318
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:21,010
If it has to do with your
heroin operation, count us out.

319
00:14:21,012 --> 00:14:22,011
I just talked to my grandpa.

320
00:14:22,013 --> 00:14:24,747
There's more at work here than
just old people pushing pills.

321
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:27,816
Stan, we told you we
don't want to be involved.

322
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:29,151
The head bitch of the nursing home

323
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:30,419
is gonna take my grandpa down...

324
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:31,453
Maybe my whole family!

325
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,155
Get outta the way, dude!

326
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:34,856
But I know what to do!

327
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:36,758
Whoever has the best Hummels
controls the nursing home.

328
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,775
We gotta steal this
lady's Hummel collection

329
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,049
and give it to my grandpa.

330
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:42,030
Dude, Stan, even if
we wanted to help you,

331
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:43,665
which we don't, there's no way

332
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,533
We can sneak into an old folks home,

333
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:46,935
distract all the old people,

334
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:48,503
and take an old lady's Hummels.

335
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:50,739
Oh, wait, there totally
is a way you could do that.

336
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:52,373
Yeah? What... What is it, Cartman?

337
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,142
Dude, we're not getting involved!

338
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,177
Cartman, if you have
an idea, please tell me.

339
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:57,445
I need you.

340
00:14:57,447 --> 00:14:59,648
I know how to distract old people.

341
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,516
Aw, shit.

342
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,253
Yes?

343
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:07,054
We're at Mimi Thompson's party.

344
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:08,922
Peppa Pig just collapsed on stage!

345
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:12,726
Oh, my God! Don't let anyone
near Peppa Pig until I arrive!

346
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,863
Move aside! Let me through!

347
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:18,632
Aw, Peppa. Peppa, can you hear me?

348
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:23,737
My name is Marcus Preston.
Can you understand me?

349
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,539
Where did you get the drugs, Peppa?

350
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,940
Was it from Stan Marsh?

351
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:28,542
Yo, man, what you talkin' 'bout?

352
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:29,977
Get me a fucking ambulance.

353
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:31,545
Shh! Peppa, focus.

354
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,547
Soon you'll be in Heaven,

355
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:36,283
jumping in all the muddy
puddles you can imagine,

356
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:39,085
but first, you must tell me...

357
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:41,688
Where do the Hummels go, Peppa?

358
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,690
All right, let us
through. Get away, kids.

359
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,559
Peppa, now! Why Hummels?

360
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:46,993
You've got to squeal!

361
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:49,262
Old people!

362
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:51,831
Old people... love Hummels.

363
00:15:55,336 --> 00:15:56,635
It's okay.

364
00:15:56,637 --> 00:15:59,405
She's with Chuck E. Cheese now.

365
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:06,516
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, hello.

366
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:08,751
We are adorable children
here to entertain old people.

367
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:10,586
Didn't think we had
anyone scheduled tonight.

368
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:12,221
Are you with the Protestant youth group?

369
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:15,390
Yes, that's right. We are young prostitutes
here to volunteer however we can.

370
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,759
Fine.

371
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:19,028
Round 'em up! We got another kids choir!

372
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,295
Come on! Let's go!

373
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:22,297
Children's choir in the commons.

374
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,633
- Aw, damn it.
- Shit.

375
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:26,697
Darling children are gonna
sing for you. Move your asses!

376
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:28,303
Aw, not again!

377
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:31,773
All right, seniors, how
are we feeling tonight?

378
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,875
Our youth group has
come to lift your spirits

379
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:36,044
with some songs to take
you down memory lane.

380
00:16:36,046 --> 00:16:39,147
We hope you can enjoy
some nice old-people music.

Hello, Mr. Marsh.

411
00:18:12,273 --> 00:18:13,339
Marcus.

412
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:15,941
I told you I'd bring you down.

413
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:18,510
Marcus, it's not what you think.

414
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:20,012
I'm trying to make things better here.

415
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:21,380
Oh, I'll bet you are.

416
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:23,715
You, your grandpa, all the people here

417
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:25,350
are going to jail!

418
00:18:25,352 --> 00:18:26,618
I'm calling the police.

419
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,986
You can put an end to this place,

420
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:29,588
but you won't be stopping the problem!

421
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,556
These people are victims too, Marcus.

422
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:33,024
Victims of a way bigger game

423
00:18:33,026 --> 00:18:34,693
being played by way bigger people.

424
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:37,061
Oh, you're a fine one for speeches...

425
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:39,263
When it comes to saving your own ass.

426
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:40,866
It's not for me, Marcus.

427
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:44,369
Look, I know you loved Chuck E. Cheese.

428
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:48,639
I know you'd do anything

429
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:50,975
to bring down the people
who took him from you.

430
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:57,615
That's why you have
to go further, Marcus.

431
00:18:57,617 --> 00:19:00,584
Take it to the people who
profited from Chuck E.'s addiction.

432
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:04,622
He was just a mouse...

433
00:19:04,624 --> 00:19:09,059
who wanted to make people happy.

434
00:19:11,531 --> 00:19:13,564

Hey, where y'all going?

440
00:19:24,843 --> 00:19:26,576
Back to our rooms.

441
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:29,279
You kids are absolutely awful.

442
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:35,451
What the... Someone is in my room!

443
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:41,257
Whaaaaat?!

444
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:45,127
Billy, what are you doing here?

445
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:46,429
Surprise, Grandpa.

446
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:48,030
I got what you needed.

447
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:50,399
Huh?

448
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:51,800
Billy!

449
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:53,936
Mrs. McGullicutty's Hummel collection!

450
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:55,304
You got it for me!

451
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:56,805
Yeah, Grandpa.

452
00:19:56,807 --> 00:19:58,474
Now you can put a stop
to all this, right?

453
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:01,610
Yeah. I just might be able to.

454
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:07,649
What are you doing, Grandpa?

455
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:09,084
I told you, Billy...

456
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:12,454
These Hummels hold a special
power with old people.

457
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:14,556
You!

458
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:16,992
Go on, get outta here.

459
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:19,494
You really thought stealing my Hummels

460
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:22,063
will make YOU the head
bitch in this place?!

461
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,999
Yeah, I think it will.

462
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:28,769
Ooh!

463
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:29,670
Aah!

464
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:30,671
Ohh!

465
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:33,441
Ooh!

466
00:20:44,687 --> 00:20:48,455
Now you know how we do
shit in the nursing home.

467
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:51,025
That's pretty sweet.

468
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,032
You get your paws off of me, young man!

469
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:01,367
There, there, Mrs. McGullicutty.

470
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:03,006
Everything's gonna be all right.

471
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,571
No! Not Solitaire!

472
00:21:05,573 --> 00:21:09,542
I won't play it! You can't make me!

473
00:21:09,544 --> 00:21:12,378
Congratulations on becoming
head bitch, Grandpa.

474
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,846
Thank you, Billy.

475
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:15,881
Now, if only we could take down

476
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:18,484
the real douche bags
who profit from all this.

477
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,818
Aw, don't worry.

478
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,120
I have a feeling that's about to happen.

479
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,164
Ladies and gentlemen...

480
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,034
My name is Marcus Preston.

481
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:38,370
I have some questions.

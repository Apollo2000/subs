00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:30,447
Yeah!
How you like that, bitch?!

159
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,330
Will you assholes
knock it off?!

160
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:34,747
Don't you know every time you
wave Confederate flags around

161
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,228
you make the rest of us
look stupid?!

162
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:38,619
Those things
are replacing us!

163
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,306
Put the flag down unless you
wanna get pepper sprayed.

164
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,460
I'll pepper spray you,
sonabitch!

165
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,557
- Oh, ah, damn it!
- you!

166
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:46,978
- Ah, damn it!
- Take that!

167
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:48,653
Knock it off! Ow!

168
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:56,658
The complaint states that your
protest has resulted in damages

169
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,080
in excess of $50,000

170
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:01,525
We have a right to protest,
Your Honor!

171
00:08:01,577 --> 00:08:03,979
- Yeah, they took our jobs!
- You tell 'em, Darryl!

172
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:07,423
Order. We will
now hear from the plaintiffs

173
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:09,150
who are seeking damages...

174
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:11,056
Your Honor,
we have a TV show

175
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:13,462
called "White People
Renovating Houses."

176
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:16,431
We named it that well before
these guys decided

177
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,908
to start taking <i>our</i> brand
and run it through the gutter.

178
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:21,565
People are going to start
associating

179
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:24,705
"White People Renovating Houses"
with their hateful stupidity!

180
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:27,098
Well, just change the name
of your show then.

181
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:28,518
- Yeah!
- That's right!

182
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:29,947
- That's right!
- Took er der!

183
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,338
All the other names
were taken Your Honor.

184
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:34,158
Everyone's got
a flipping show.

185
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:35,455
"Gay People
Renovating Houses,"

186
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:37,368
"Las Vegas People
Renovating Homes,"

187
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:38,672
"Texas People
Flipping Houses,"

188
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,200
"Little People
Flipping Big Houses"...

189
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:41,634
Everything else was taken,

190
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:43,978
and, damn it, we've built
our show into something!

191
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,376
We're trying to help people,
and it's impossible

192
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,197
with these guys waving
a Confederate flag

193
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:49,533
every chance they get.

194
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:52,316
- Hey, there's a bee in here!
- I'll get it!

195
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:55,890
- Take that, bee!
- Yeah!

196
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,978
Dude, what's happened?

197
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,533
It was awful, you guys.

198
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:06,173
It was so vicious
and hateful.

199
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:08,369
- What was?
- Heidi.

200
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:10,681
We were just trying to have
a nice lunch

201
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:14,537
and she... started going off
on me like a Jekyll and Hyde.

202
00:09:14,813 --> 00:09:16,673
It's been going on
for a long time...

203
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:20,900
Heidi's... mentally abusive,
guys... there I-I said it.

204
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,205
Heidi abuses you?

205
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:26,644
She... does these things
to slowly tear me down.

206
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:28,689
Everything's a head game
with her.

207
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,565
You don't understand what
it's like to live with it.

208
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,923
You don't understand.

209
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,275
So what do you
want from us?

210
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,626
I know...

211
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:37,330
that the person Heidi
wants to be is still in here.

212
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,439
But she needs help.

213
00:09:39,532 --> 00:09:42,314
I have to get her that help,
but I'm scared.

214
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:44,337
Can I count on
you guys' support?

215
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:46,806
How do you change someone
who's mentally abusive?

216
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:49,392
I don't know...
but Alexa will.

217
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:51,462
Alexa's sweet.

218
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:58,352
We just gotta hunker down
and stick together here!

219
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:00,155
What's the use, Darryl?

220
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,344
Ain't nobody takin' us
serious-like.

221
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:06,016
Hey, waiter! This soup is too
hot, I cain't even eat it!

222
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:08,125
I'll cool it down!
Yeah!

223
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:13,188
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Stop it! Stop it!

224
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:14,882
I came to make a truce.

225
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,789
Now look, there's been
a lot of hurt here.

226
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:21,156
Hurt from both sides.
It's time to end it.

227
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:25,344
What if I told you
I could get you all jobs?

228
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,586
- Huh? Jobs?
- Get us jobs?

229
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,109
You're fulla shit.

230
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:31,945
No. I've spoken to everyone
in the community,

231
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:34,774
and they've agreed to go along
with my plan.

232
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:37,866
I believe I have a solution
to all of this.

So, Heather and Mike,
what we're thinking

271
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:10,969
is to take out
this wall

272
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:12,844
between your kitchen
and your living room

273
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,734
to give you a more open concept
with space to entertain.

274
00:12:16,782 --> 00:12:18,274
So, let's talk
about materials.

275
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,969
What did you pick out,
Sharon?

276
00:12:20,036 --> 00:12:23,605
I was gonna do a Bella Terra
quartz for the countertops.

277
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:26,391
Hey, Darryl,
add Bella Terra quartz slabs

278
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:28,609
to our shopping list.

279
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,922
Doot-doot.

280
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:33,179
I've added Bella Terra slabs
to your shopping list.

281
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,352
And what about
the backsplash, Sharon?

282
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:38,297
I was gonna go with these
Carrara subway tiles.

283
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,328
Hey, Darryl,
add Carrara subway tiles

284
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,994
to our shopping list.

285
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:47,289
Hey, Darryl.
Add Carrara...

286
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:50,037
Fine! I've added Carrara
gay-wad pussy tile

287
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,656
to your shopping list!

288
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,266
That's...
That's not what I said.

289
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:58,229
Hey, Darryl,
add Carrara subway tile

290
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,625
to my shopping list.

291
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,027
I ain't doin' it!

292
00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:03,470
This job is
degrading and menial!

293
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,978
Well, what kind of job did you
think you were gonna get?

294
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:09,610
Hey, Darryl,
what kind of job

295
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:11,494
did you think
you were going to get?

296
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:14,087
Somethin' that
was Goddamn dignified!

297
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:17,728
Hey, Darryl, sorry, but you
did not go to college,

298
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:19,938
so you have to take
the jobs you can get.

299
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:22,261
I'm sorry!
I do not get that!

300
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:23,735
Hey, Darryl.

301
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:25,806
Hey, Darryl.

302
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:27,509
What?!

303
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:28,945
Coal mining
and truck driving

304
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:31,321
are not exactly
jobs of the future,

305
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:35,859
so add Carrara subway tile
to my shopping list.

306
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:43,985
Everything's my fault.
You're right.

307
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:47,142
Everything that you
did to me... I deserved it.

308
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:48,618
Uh, what?

309
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:49,927
It's not you.
It's me.

310
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:52,509
I just have to learn
to not make you so angry.

311
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:54,953
I'll do the best I can.

312
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:58,806
No, it's not that.
Relationships are 50/50, Eric.

313
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,711

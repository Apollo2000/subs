to refer to our cafeteria

in your school paper.

00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:17,498

about the rights of people
with disabilities.

36
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:25,498
When you use the "R" word
to describe

37
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:28,498
the school's lunch policy,
it can hurt people's hearts.

Can you understand that at all?

39
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:31,498
That was an Op-Ed piece
in the paper

40

written by a first grader

41
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:34,498
who found the school lunch
policy to be ridiculous,

42
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:37,498
and he thought "r-retarded" to
be the best word to describe it.

43
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:39,498
As the editor of the paper,
I didn't think it was right

44
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,499
to censor the words
the student used.

ignores individuality,

disability with being --

and it -- and it -- Spot!
I need a spotter!

Spot me!
Somebody spot me, bro!

of a derogatory hate speech

and loneliness,

Principal Victoria,

480
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:32,361
if everything you've said
is true,

481
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,361
then why doesn't anyone
know about it?

482
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:36,361
There are people
who know,

483
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:38,361
but they have to stay
very hidden.

484
00:18:38,362 --> 00:18:41,361
I'm just having a hard time
swallowing all this.

485
00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:43,361
And between me
and this one over here,

486
00:18:43,362 --> 00:18:44,361
we can swallow
just about anything.

487
00:18:44,362 --> 00:18:47,361
[ Chuckles ]
God, you're such an asshole.

488
00:18:47,362 --> 00:18:49,963
Mr. Garrison,
I wasn't fired.

489
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,361
I was replaced.

490
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:55,361
This goes much higher
than anyone knows.

491
00:18:55,362 --> 00:18:58,283
I came to this town

492
00:18:58,362 --> 00:19:00,361
really thinking I could make
a difference.

493
00:19:00,362 --> 00:19:03,361
I've been called a bigot towards
persons with disabilities.

494
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:06,361
I've been called
a...pussy crusher

495
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:07,361
because of the behavior

496
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:10,361
of a very few individuals
in my PC frat.

497
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:13,361
Jimmy Valmer
is off the school newspaper.

498
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,361
I want you to take over.

499
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,361
Oh, boy!

500
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:18,361
And I will be reviewing
your paper to make sure

501
00:19:18,362 --> 00:19:21,361
nobody is ever attacked
the way I was again.

502
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:23,361
I think this will be
the beginning

503
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,361
of a beautiful friendship.

504
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:27,361
Jimmy almost made me
lose confidence,

505
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:29,361
but I know who I am.

506
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:31,361
I know <i>what</i> I am.

507

MAN: Dude! Bro!

508
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:33,361
Oh, bro.

509
00:19:33,362 --> 00:19:35,361
I went online
to read a news story

510
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:37,361
about immigrants
being discriminated against.

511
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:39,361
Yeah.
Well, and so I clicked
on the headline,

512
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:41,361
but it turned out
to be an ad for Reddi-wip,

513
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:43,361
so then I clicked
on the "X" button
to make it go away,

514
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:45,361
but then it was a link
to another ad,

515
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:46,361
and when I tried
to cancel that,

516
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:48,361
another window came up,
and it was this.

517
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:50,361
Dude,
what the [bleep] bro?

Holy shit.
What?

530
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:23,361
Can you excuse me
for a moment?

531
00:20:23,362 --> 00:20:26,361
Okay.

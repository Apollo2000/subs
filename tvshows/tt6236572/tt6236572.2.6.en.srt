1
00:00:00,054 --> 00:00:03,132
<i>Do you know what's going on with
Dr. Dunn in the conference room?</i>

2
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:06,127
<i>He's leading an investigation
into Betty Lisko's death.</i>

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,380
And then a warm feeling
of peacefulness

4
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:11,815
will take you slowly into
sleep.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,859
Why did you have to kill
someone at the hospital?

6
00:00:15,936 --> 00:00:18,549
If they figure it out,
I'll deal with it.

7
00:00:18,796 --> 00:00:20,948
Are you opening up a spa?

8
00:00:21,016 --> 00:00:22,330
A hospice.

9
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:24,812
This is for those who've come
to terms with their illness.

10
00:00:24,889 --> 00:00:28,166
They can come here
to die in peace.

11
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:31,698
You can stop the chemo.

12
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:33,822
And you can say good-bye
the way you want.

13
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:36,258
I would want it to be a party.

14
00:00:36,385 --> 00:00:38,010
A performance.

15
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:40,778
I know I've taken you
for granted recently.

16
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:42,846
And I'm sorry for that.

17
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:45,263
Hello?

18
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:46,893

I need to talk to Mary.</i>

19
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:48,784
I'm sorry, baby.
I really...

20
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:51,707
I have to go.

21
00:00:55,237 --> 00:00:56,821
Okay, you need surgery.

22
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:58,065
You do it, all right?

23
00:00:58,133 --> 00:00:59,729
Anything you want is yours.

24
00:00:59,854 --> 00:01:01,479
Just help me.

25
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:03,276
I know how to get Olivia.

26
00:01:04,868 --> 00:01:05,969

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,018
I wouldn't go that far.

33
00:01:29,193 --> 00:01:30,721

34
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:31,941
I don't know.

00:01:32,032 --> 00:01:33,590
Mmm.
They're filler flowers.

You deserve better than that.

37
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:36,821
Well, what about these?

38
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,747
I heard
Madonna hates hydrangeas.

39
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:42,135
Mmm, relax, Madge.
She's just jealous.

40

I really can't figure
these out.

43
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:49,393
They're so aggressive.

44
00:01:50,955 --> 00:01:53,532
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Okay.

45
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:54,803

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,938

Mm-hmm.

You didn't do anything wrong.

66
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:23,955
Yeah, but I am a big believer
in guilt by association.

67
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:26,128
The hospital like
to blame nurses

when things go wrong.

69
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:31,658
Here's what you say.

70
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:34,041
That you saw me in the ICU...

71
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,237
Which is true, right?

72
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:38,135
Yeah.

73
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:40,485
And I'll tell them
I was visiting a patient

74
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,283
that was transferred.

75
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:45,114
Remember when I told you
that I admired

76
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,323
that maverick attitude of yours?

77
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,330
I take it back.

78
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:52,088
If we stick to the story,
we'll be fine.

79
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:55,448
Do you really think
you can get away with this?

80
00:04:01,861 --> 00:04:03,791
Ready for you,
Dr. Harris.

81
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:10,635
Take a seat.

82
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:16,178
So, we're looking into
the death of Betty Lisko,

83
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,846
who died here in the hospital.

84
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,541
I know.

85
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:23,118
So you may know that we believe

86
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:25,291
someone assisted in her death.

87
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:28,526
You were in the ICU that night.

88
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,057
I was visiting a patient, yeah.

89
00:04:31,596 --> 00:04:33,885
And did you go into
Betty's room at all?

90
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:35,721
No, I didn't.

91
00:04:36,104 --> 00:04:39,299
Did you see anyone else enter
or leave the room?

92
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:41,260
No.

93
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,557
So you had no contact
with her at all, then?

94
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:50,190
Why are you doing this?

95
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:54,983
Because we believe
someone killed Betty Lisko.

96
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,096
After she tried to kill herself.

97
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,540
If you wanna get into 
a debate

98
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:00,345
- about assisted suicide...
- I'd love to.

99
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:02,393
Let's have a reasonable
discussion about death.

100
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:04,170
You start.

101
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,424
Okay, I will.

102
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:10,032
Death gives life meaning.
Let's agree on that.

103
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,760
Let's agree that life
is precious because it ends.

104
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,111
From what I hear,

105
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:17,971
Betty Lisko died like everybody
else who ever lived ever.

106
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,346
But she chose
to take her own life.

107
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,712
And now you wanna prosecute
someone for helping her do

108
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,971
what she wanted to do.

109
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,791
So what you're really saying is,

110
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:28,632
this wasn't her choice to make.

111
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:31,377
- Mary, calm down.
- No, she wanted to die.

112
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:32,936
Betty wanted to die.

113
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:34,729
She tried her best to do it.

114
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,083
She suffered
catastrophic injuries.

115
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,698
The rest of her life
would have been

116
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,580
a physiological and
psychological nightmare.

117
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:45,041
You know, people used to die
from accidents.

118
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:46,498
They used to die suddenly.

119
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:47,732
But now in this country,

120
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:49,571
almost everyone dies
hooked up to machines

121
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:51,039
designed to prolong their lives

122
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:53,033
when there's no life
left to live.

123
00:05:53,463 --> 00:05:55,207
That's the system
you're upholding

124
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:57,346
by conducting
this stupid, pointless,

125
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,047
narrow-minded investigation.

126
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,432
So just stop it.

127
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:04,753
I wanna find out
who killed Betty Lisko

128
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,846
so the hospital
doesn't get sued.

129
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:13,830
I don't belong here.

130
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,057
I'll send you my resignation
by the end of the day.

131
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:28,002
- Did you...
- No.

132
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,041
I quit.

133
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:31,643
Oh, my God.

134
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:33,705
It was a long time coming.

135
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,118
You know where to find me.

136
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,541
Yeah, but I'm not
dumb enough to go there.

137
00:06:39,628 --> 00:06:41,143
So, is this good-bye?

138
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,135
Hardly.

139
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,369
You and Des still
owe me 50 grand.

140
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:47,058
With interest, I assume.

141
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:49,768
Yeah, you know it.
So get cracking.

142
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:54,619
Have you seen your mom at all?

143
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,026
No.

144
00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:58,182
Not since that night.

145
00:06:59,346 --> 00:07:00,737
Been at my dad's.

146
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:02,674
Ignoring her calls.

147
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:07,650
You know,
at the end of the day,

148
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:11,204
people disappoint you
and let you down, so...

149
00:07:11,937 --> 00:07:14,121
Okay, Holden Caulfield.

150
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,299
You think I sound crazy?

151
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,987
No.

152
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:23,832
Actually, it sounds like
you're trying to get

153
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:26,760
all the toxic people
out of your life.

154
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,651
Exactly, yeah.

155
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,166
Except for Naomi.

156
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:33,494
You're still talking to her.

157
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,588
Shit, do I sound jealous?

158
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:38,705
No, it's okay.

159
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:40,768
I'm sorry.
She just gets under my skin.

160
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:43,346
Yeah, because she's a lunatic.

161
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:45,611
Hey.

162
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:48,510
It's hard with Naomi
because I feel like

163
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,237
if I wasn't her friend,

164
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:52,494
she wouldn't have anybody,
and...

165
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:56,424
She's damaged or something.

166
00:07:56,938 --> 00:07:59,393
My dad says she gets it
from her mom.

167
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:04,002
Heather, you don't need
to be jealous, okay?

168
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:36,612
Are you trying to hurt me?

169
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:38,924
Always better
to rip it off fast.

170
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:40,065
Sure.

171
00:08:40,215 --> 00:08:41,932
You're healing well.

172
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:44,012
Patio looks good, too.

173
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,080
I see you've mopped up
all the blood.

174
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:48,540
All you need is some bleach
and a friend.

175
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:51,627
Or an assortment
of terrified employees.

176
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:54,385
You think I'm friendless?

177
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:57,049
You're wrong.
Mary's my friend.

178
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,584
Oh, I'm joking.
I know you both hate me.

179
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:05,268
We wanna talk to you
about your offer.

180
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:06,690
Mmm?

181
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:09,041
What'd you have in mind?

182
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:13,143
Pentobarbital.

183
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,240
You want drugs?

184
00:09:15,377 --> 00:09:19,065
We're looking to expand,
and we have patients in need.

185
00:09:19,752 --> 00:09:23,424
Pentobarbital is not
the easiest drug to come by.

186
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:26,768
And, as you know,

187
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:30,033
my suppliers are a little
unnerved at the moment.

188
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:33,651
I was actually thinking about
getting out of the business.

189
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:35,401
We've done a lot for you.

190
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:37,868
Saved a life.
Ended a life.

191
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:40,151
You can look at it
as good karma.

192
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:42,041
Before you retire.

193
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:43,807
How much do you want?

194
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,963
Enough that
we don't have to ask again.

195
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:55,229
Okay.

196
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,369
For you.

197
00:09:57,488 --> 00:09:59,022
Thank you.

198
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,908
How many people
are you planning to kill?

199
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:04,189
As many as possible.

200
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,994
I'm gonna kill them
by the bucket load.

201
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:07,612
With their consent.

202
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,338
Your compassion is inspiring.

203
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,713
Look at that.

204
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,487
I can smell the testosterone
from here.

205
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,510
This is like a man cave
in the forest.

206
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:33,348
Oh, you really like
chopping wood, huh?

207
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,009
- Des.
- Oh, I'm just remarking.

208
00:10:35,086 --> 00:10:37,690
It's a stark contrast
to Olivia's.

209
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:39,714
It's very elegant
where she lives.

210
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:41,279
I know, I've been there.

211
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:42,383
You have a better view.

212
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,776
She has a pool, though.

213
00:10:43,895 --> 00:10:45,721
And matching cups.

214
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:50,518
So, what'd she say?

215
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:53,408
She said she can make it happen.

216
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:55,880
So, we wait for her to call,

217
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,690
and when she says
she has the pento,

218
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:59,580
you arrest her.

219
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:01,658
Eh, not exactly.

220
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:03,593
What does that mean?

221
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:06,614
I need you to wear a wire.

222
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,953
- Let's go, Mary.
- Wait, wait.

223
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:12,901
You never said anything
about that.

224
00:11:13,191 --> 00:11:15,016
We need proof of exchange.

225
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:17,018
Then I can arrest her.

226
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:18,135
Come on.

227
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:20,903
- Listen just a minute.
- No.

228
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,653
No, he doesn't get to change
the plans all willy nilly.

229
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:24,831
It'll be safe.

230
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:25,987
I'll be watching.

231
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:27,365
I'll be listening
the whole time.

232
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:29,119
Fine, I'll go.
Wire me up.

233
00:11:29,337 --> 00:11:31,199
I agreed to help.
I'm in this as much as her.

234
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:32,597
Look, no offense,
Desmond,

235
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:35,119
but last time you wore a wire,
it didn't go so well.

236
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,135
All right?
It has to be Mary.

237
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:39,085
Olivia trusts you.

238
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:45,018
Okay, so,
when all of this is over,

239
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,838
the police will leave us alone,
right?

240
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:51,541
No more charges,
no more investigation?

241
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:52,901
Yeah.

242
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:55,237
Once we have the supplier,

243
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,690
it'll all be over.

244
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:58,198
You're sure?

245
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,824
You don't have to worry, okay?

246
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:01,612
And neither does
your friend here.

247
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:04,940
Mary, I'm in this with you.

248
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:06,901
You have my word.

249
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:09,235
Okay.

250
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:17,393
That was all very
cloak and dagger.

251
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:19,268
You do love the drama,
don't you?

252
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:20,811
You're one to talk.

253
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:23,112
The way you were swinging
your dick around back there.

254
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,259
I'm not gonna change
your mind, am I?

255
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:28,963
Do you have a better idea
on how to deal with Olivia?

256
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:30,855
Not off hand, no.

257
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:33,002
But give me a couple of hours
and a white board...

258
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,893
Das, she won't leave us alone.

259
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,237
We killed someone for her.

260
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:40,231
My daughter won't talk
to me anymore.

261
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,402
She's ruining our lives.

262
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,565
This is a mistake
you've made before.

263
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:46,385
- What?
- Trusting Ben.

264
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,330
I'd be inclined to say
it's your fatal flaw.

265
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:51,005
More like his is trusting me.

266
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:52,432
He's a cop.

267
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:54,651
That's his fatal flaw.

268
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:04,791
Hi, guys.

269
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:06,705
Oh, my God.
I have to show you this video

270
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:08,557
that my friend sent me
the other night.

271
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,841
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop.

272
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:11,357
We were actually
trying to work.

273
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,146
I don't know why
I just love cat videos so much.

274
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:14,388
I just... I don't know.
Something about them.

275
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:15,512
It just gets me.

276
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,533
<i>You need to think about it.</i>

277
00:13:18,026 --> 00:13:19,596
<i>Do you have any questions?</i>

278
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:22,673
<i>Yeah, why a drink
and not injections?</i>

279
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,178
<i>'Cause I researched it, right?</i>

280
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:25,646
<i>And it's better to...</i>

281
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:27,119
What is this?

282
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:30,440
This is your mom's
extracurricular activity.

283
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,987
<i>Well, I think doctors
feel it's important</i>

284
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:34,955
<i>for patients to choose
their death.</i>

285
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,665
<i>I get it.
I gotta pull the trigger.</i>

286
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:39,260
She kills people.

287
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,260
<i>Okay, so how does it work,</i>

288
00:13:41,573 --> 00:13:43,260
<i>uh, the dying part?</i>

289
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:45,896
I thought you should know.
It's pretty toxic.

290
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:48,903
<i>Well, in Switzerland,
a doctor would give a patient</i>

291
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,557
<i>a lethal dose of...</i>

292
00:13:58,586 --> 00:14:01,365
What would God think of this?

293
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:06,123
Wow, you just lost
the one friend you had left.

294
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:08,430
Congratulations.

295
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:27,138
Okay, fine.
It's a good plan.

296
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:30,445
I'm sorry, were we in the middle

297
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:31,551
of a conversation?

298
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:33,130
No, but I have a few notes,
okay?

299
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:35,497
We're gonna register
the hospice in my name,

300
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:38,252
and you and Mary are gonna be
my very silent partners.

301
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:39,484
So you're in.

302
00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:40,896
And the name's gotta go.

303
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:42,186
Heavenly Bridge?

304
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:44,466
Heavenly Bridge sounds like
a bloody cult.

305
00:14:45,262 --> 00:14:47,044
Well, I could change the name.

306
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:49,193
Deep Six Lodge?

307
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,928
Dirt Nap Farm?

308
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,263
- What?
- End Game House.

309
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,310
You'll find it.

310
00:14:57,185 --> 00:14:58,369
What the hell?

311
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:00,104
You pitched hard, I said yes,

312
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:02,310
and now I'm feeling, like,
a vague sense

313
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:04,193
of disappointment here.

314
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:08,607
Do you know what
Mary's doing today?

315
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:11,015
She's wearing a wire

316
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:14,247
and walking blindly into the
lair of a murderous drug lord.

317
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:16,443
Lady.
Drug lady.

318
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:18,590
She's insane.

319
00:15:18,979 --> 00:15:21,247
My partner is insane.

320
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:24,036
You are a little late
to the party on that one.

321
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:32,646
Of course.

322
00:15:33,372 --> 00:15:35,919
She's my fatal flaw.

323
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,841
Hello?
Sorry we're a little late.

324
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:43,794
Who is that?

325
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:46,107
It's our first clients.

326
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,005
Will you stay?

327
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:55,326
Please?

328

<i>A lethal dose
of sodium-pentobarbital</i>

329
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:09,380
<i>to drink.</i>

330
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:12,079
<i>There is no... no pain,
no suffering.</i>

331
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:13,314
<i>You just fall asleep.</i>

332
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:16,474
<i>An option is to go
to Switzerland</i>

333
00:16:16,544 --> 00:16:18,914
<i>and be what they call
a death tourist.</i>

334
00:16:18,982 --> 00:16:20,451
<i>Fly there, die there.</i>

335
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,294
What are you watching?

336
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:24,191
<i>I mean, go to Switzerland
just to die?</i>

337
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:26,654
A snuff film starring you.

338
00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:29,759
<i>This is obviously
a very serious decision, so...</i>

339
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,568
Is this real?

340
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:33,396
<i>Tell you the truth...</i>

341
00:16:33,464 --> 00:16:34,885
Yes.

342
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:37,021
Who are these people?

343
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:41,015
The man with
the British accent is Des.

344
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,826
He's my friend and my partner.

345
00:16:42,894 --> 00:16:45,208
- In crime.
- Assisted suicide.

346
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:49,576
And the other man
is a police officer.

347
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,452
- You killed a cop?
- No.

348
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:53,201
Jess, no.

349
00:16:53,728 --> 00:16:56,763
He wasn't dying.
He was working undercover.

350
00:16:57,355 --> 00:17:00,482
So... but does that mean
you're going to jail now?

351
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,123
No, baby,
I'm not going to jail.

352
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,263
- Jess, I'm so sorry.
- No.

353
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:10,597
No, how am I supposed to
explain this to people?

354
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,326
Yeah, my mom, she kills people
on the side.

355
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:15,811
- That's just no big deal. She just...
- You don't have to lie for me, ever.

356
00:17:15,878 --> 00:17:17,730
That's all you've done to me.

357
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:24,011
I didn't know how to explain it.

358
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:28,480
I didn't know what you'd think.
I was afraid.

359
00:17:31,632 --> 00:17:33,425
I'm your mother.

360
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:36,120
I'm supposed to be
a role model.

361
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:37,933
A good person.

362
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:39,839
Are you?

363
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:42,605
A good person, I don't know.

364
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:44,908
I have no idea.

365
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:51,879
You know about my mother, right?

366
00:17:51,956 --> 00:17:53,253
How she died?

367
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:56,276
You killed her.

368
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,128
I helped her.

369
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,386
I helped her
because I loved her.

370
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:04,331
She was in so much pain, Jess.

371
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:06,360
And she wanted it to end.

372
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:16,203
All I know is that
this is a...

373
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:20,198
It's a big part of who
I am now.

374
00:18:23,313 --> 00:18:25,542
I wish you'd just told me,
though.

375
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:28,237
I wish I had, too.

376
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:30,886
Before I lost you.

377
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:35,776
Mom, you always told me
to be open.

378
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:37,838
And honest.

379
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:45,132
If this is really who you are,
then stop lying about it.

380
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:46,372
Okay?

381
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:47,667
Okay.

382
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:52,683
Jess, I'm taking care
of all of this.

383
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,683
Okay.

384
00:18:57,724 --> 00:18:59,417
Thank you.

385
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:08,383
I'm seeing mandalas.

386
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:09,607
Mandela?

387
00:19:09,684 --> 00:19:11,316
Right, I'm an admirer.

388
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,281
Big fan, but what do you mean?

389
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:15,451
Uh,
photos of the great man?

390
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,818
He means mandalas,
sacred diagrams of the cosmos.

391
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:20,052
Yes, exactly.

392
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,068
I'm not sure if we...
The death retreat

393
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:25,323
has the capabilities for
sacred diagrams at this point.

394
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:26,987
They're just fancy circles.

395
00:19:27,112 --> 00:19:28,869
I see everyone holding hands.

396
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:30,151
Yes.

397
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:34,419
And I'll be lying right here
on the stage.

398
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:36,304
We'll need more marigolds
for the trees.

399
00:19:36,381 --> 00:19:37,434
Check.

400
00:19:37,502 --> 00:19:40,263
Stage?
A literal stage?

401
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,611
The crowd can gather here.

402
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:49,200
If I may interject,
how many people

403
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:51,002
are we expecting
at this event?

404
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,509
Because this is more of a, uh,

405
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,368
- clandestine kind of place.
- Desmond,

406
00:19:56,548 --> 00:19:58,095
stop killing the vibe.

407
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:01,547
The marigolds are
gonna be gorgeous.

408
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:04,599
Your sister told me about the
Day of the Dead festivities.

409
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:06,564
I am very inspired
by the whole thing.

410
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:08,254
Yes, let's talk about makeup.

411
00:20:08,322 --> 00:20:10,896
Those eerie, you know,
crazy skeleton faces.

412
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:12,240
Is that too much?

413
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:14,288
Maybe a subtler version.

414
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:15,798
We're gonna need to find
a makeup artist.

415
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,439
Well, I'm...
I'm a makeup artist.

416
00:20:17,931 --> 00:20:19,814
I would love to help you,
if you would like.

417
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:22,250
Yes, I would love that.

418
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:23,673
Let's discuss.

419
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:26,212
I can even show you
some pictures, references.

420
00:20:26,345 --> 00:20:27,790
You show me
whatever you want.

421
00:20:33,606 --> 00:20:35,679
Is this where they always go?

422
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:38,124
It's one of the places.

423
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,140
Just in case you get a pat down.

424
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:43,179
Will that happen?

425
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:45,171
No.

426
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:47,008
I mean, I would love to,

427
00:20:47,085 --> 00:20:49,476
but now's not the time,
you know?

428
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:53,437
You're shaking.

429
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:57,241
Mary, it's gonna be fine.

430
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,292
All right, as soon as you get
into that warehouse...

431
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,858
I ask for the drugs.

432
00:21:02,163 --> 00:21:03,819
We make the exchange.

433
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:05,569
You come in.

434
00:21:07,352 --> 00:21:08,694
Exactly.

435
00:21:09,223 --> 00:21:11,390
Gonna need a safe word, too.

436
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:13,374
Just in case.

437
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,819
Safe word like like in S&M?

438
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,749
Kind of.

439
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,470
Something unusual that you
could slip into conversation.

440
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:27,999
Karma.

441
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:30,460
Karma?

442
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,616
It tends to come up.

443
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,922
Karma it is.

444
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,687
So, if you think
that she's made you,

445
00:21:41,302 --> 00:21:42,530
or you're in any danger,

446
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:44,732
you say the word
and I will be there.

447
00:21:46,257 --> 00:21:48,421
Oh, I'm so nervous.

448
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:51,249
Did you get scared?
Undercover?

449
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,069
I liked it.

450
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:55,554
Being afraid?

451
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,827
Being clear.

452
00:21:58,386 --> 00:22:00,780
Mary, I get to do all this
crazy shit, too,

453
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:04,898
but at the end of the day
I know that I'm gonna be safe.

454
00:22:05,426 --> 00:22:07,562
I know which side of the line
I'm on.

455

<i>♪ To find the center ♪</i>

456
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,061
My boss.

457
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:26,941
You good to go?

458
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:28,372
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

459
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:29,911
Yeah, we're good.

460
00:22:56,868 --> 00:22:58,532
Hi, Mary.

461
00:23:03,384 --> 00:23:04,657
Hi.

462
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:07,720
You'll be happy to know
I've been feeling great all day.

463
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:10,663
The body's amazing, isn't it?

464
00:23:10,735 --> 00:23:12,165
Just wants to heal.

465
00:23:12,316 --> 00:23:15,064
As your physician,
I'm delighted.

466
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:17,728
So, is my stuff here?

467
00:23:18,282 --> 00:23:20,610
You're not really that naive,
are you?

468
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:32,674
Where are we going?

469
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:34,327
Do you really care?

470
00:23:34,816 --> 00:23:37,111
My mother told me never
to ride with strangers.

471
00:23:37,188 --> 00:23:38,897
But I'm not a stranger, Mary.

472
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:40,631
You've been inside me.

473
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:42,858
Do you want it or not?

474
00:23:43,428 --> 00:23:44,649
I want it.

475
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:46,758
<i>Then get in the car.</i>

476
00:24:04,602 --> 00:24:05,863
What do you think?

477
00:24:05,994 --> 00:24:07,119
Safe house?

478
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,522
Stash?

479
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:11,194
Yeah, maybe,
but it's not part of the plan.

480
00:24:11,262 --> 00:24:12,477
This is Fordham.

481
00:24:12,545 --> 00:24:14,716
Follow vehicles to our location.

482
00:24:18,682 --> 00:24:20,420
Where are we going?

483
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:23,285
The promised land.

484
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,306
You know what
I was saying before

485
00:24:26,374 --> 00:24:28,108
about getting out
of the business?

486
00:24:29,147 --> 00:24:30,967
It was just a moment of doubt.

487
00:24:31,577 --> 00:24:33,647
I could never really leave
all this behind.

488
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:36,280
We are who we are.

489
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:38,673
It's just so much more fun
out here on the fringes,

490
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,217
don't you think?

491
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:43,139
I don't know,
my life is pretty normal.

492
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,842
<i>Sure it is.</i>

493
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:47,271
<i>I have to thank you.</i>

494
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:48,416
<i>For what?</i>

495
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:49,772
<i>You freed me.</i>

496
00:24:50,028 --> 00:24:52,881
<i>From death.
From Travis.</i>

497
00:24:53,353 --> 00:24:55,366
From my brother.

498
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:01,866
He must have loved you.

499
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,069
He was all about brunettes.

500
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:06,831
And the tiny ones.

501
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:08,436
Can we change the subject,
please?

502
00:25:08,513 --> 00:25:09,871
Did he love you, Mary?

503
00:25:10,022 --> 00:25:11,553
I barely knew him.

504
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:13,897
You were exactly his type.

505
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:15,506
And not just physically.

506
00:25:15,987 --> 00:25:19,295
You were mysterious, calculated,

507
00:25:19,406 --> 00:25:20,764
a true Machiavellian.

508
00:25:20,881 --> 00:25:22,293
Are we going to your safe
house or something?

509
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,581
You'll see.

510
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:25,710
You know,
I actually really admire

511
00:25:25,847 --> 00:25:28,311
the way you keep your hands
all nice and clean.

512
00:25:28,452 --> 00:25:30,493
<i>Why do the dirty work when
you can have someone else</i>

513
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:32,149
<i>do it...
Oh, just stop it, please.</i>

514
00:25:32,217 --> 00:25:34,428
<i>Oh, come on, Mary.</i>

515
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:37,345
"Cop pulled the trigger,
but I let Grady

516
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:38,833
bleed out and die."

517
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:43,264
<i>That's what you said to me
the first day we met.</i>

518
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:45,917
<i>I got you to be
my gun with Travis,</i>

519
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:48,725
<i>just like you got that cop
to be yours.</i>

520
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:52,030
You think that,
but you're wrong.

521
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,702
Am I?

522
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:56,250
What the hell
is she talking about?

523
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:00,717
I don't know.

524
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:02,592
<i>You looked me in the eye
and told me</i>

525
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:04,405
you killed my brother.

526
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:07,795
I did everything
I could to save him.

527
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,847
Stop.

528
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:31,118
You know what makes me crazy?

529
00:26:31,195 --> 00:26:35,085
Just wanna sit up on my throne,

530
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:38,731
but there is always
some bitch gunning for me.

531
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:40,351
I do believe in karma.

532
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:41,625
What?

533
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:43,468
<i>You asked me before
if I believed in karma.</i>

534
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:45,630
- <i>I do.</i>
- That's it. That's her safe word.

535
00:26:46,684 --> 00:26:48,106
I didn't hear it.

536
00:26:50,356 --> 00:26:52,153
Ben, what are you doing?

537
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,098
What are we doing?

538
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,036
Getting a car wash, dummy.

539
00:27:15,815 --> 00:27:17,711
And I was being so good to you,

540
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:19,379
getting all your pento.

541
00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:21,005
They can't hear us?

542
00:27:21,324 --> 00:27:22,794
Not in here.

543
00:27:34,768 --> 00:27:36,169
What's our play?

544
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:38,974
Shit.

545
00:27:45,578 --> 00:27:48,450
I was gonna let you walk away.

546
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:51,444
You were never gonna
let me walk away.

547
00:27:51,521 --> 00:27:53,279
It was never gonna be enough.

548
00:27:53,442 --> 00:27:55,364
So you go running to the cops.

549
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,052
You actually think
they're gonna help you?

550
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,497
It was that or kill you.

551
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:05,688
Why did you save me, Mary?

552
00:28:05,794 --> 00:28:08,161
- Because that's who I am.
- Bullshit.

553
00:28:08,535 --> 00:28:10,247
Don't pretend to be an angel.

554
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:13,067
You did it
so you could watch me suffer.

555
00:28:13,685 --> 00:28:15,980
You wanna know why
I saved your life?

556
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,438
Because I didn't wanna
turn into you.

557
00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:22,739
You crossed that line a year
ago when you killed my brother.

558
00:28:22,816 --> 00:28:24,105
This was my way back.

559
00:28:24,173 --> 00:28:25,931
There is no way back.

560
00:28:28,005 --> 00:28:29,849
We're in this together now.

561
00:28:30,372 --> 00:28:32,318
Now we can finally
have that play date.

562
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:33,583
In jail.

563
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,020
On visiting day.

564
00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:37,169
I'm not going to jail.

565
00:28:37,564 --> 00:28:40,833
Then we better get
our stories straight right now.

566
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,739
Get out of the car.
Put your hands in the air.

567
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:16,559
Stop.

568
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:20,906
Turn around.
Slowly.

569
00:29:55,782 --> 00:29:57,524
Am I under arrest?

570
00:30:00,413 --> 00:30:03,876
My boss wants to ask Olivia
a few questions first.

571
00:30:04,673 --> 00:30:06,509
Particularly about you.

572
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:09,045
And what we heard over the wire.

573
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:11,184
You feeling okay about that?

574
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:12,876
What are you doing?

575
00:30:13,426 --> 00:30:14,964
Just giving you a chance to tell

576
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:16,938
your side of the story, Mary.

577
00:30:19,206 --> 00:30:21,691
Mary's my friend, that's all.

578
00:30:22,743 --> 00:30:25,187
- We have daughters close in age.
- Mm.

579
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:28,968
Do you get pentobarbital
for all your friends?

580
00:30:29,045 --> 00:30:30,344
Pento-what?

581
00:30:31,244 --> 00:30:33,110
I don't know what
you're talking about.

582
00:30:35,173 --> 00:30:36,439
Right.

583
00:30:36,594 --> 00:30:39,110
Okay, then let me ask you
about your husband.

584
00:30:39,485 --> 00:30:42,618
Your friend Mary told us that
you wanted him dead.

585
00:30:44,357 --> 00:30:45,852
I was kidding.

586
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:48,488
Women joke about killing...

587
00:30:48,565 --> 00:30:50,623
Their husbands all the time.

588
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:54,561
It was just a misunderstanding.

589
00:30:54,638 --> 00:30:55,892
I'm sorry.

590
00:30:55,969 --> 00:30:58,698
Good, so what happened
in the car wash?

591
00:31:05,244 --> 00:31:06,969
So, after all of this,

592
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,548
you're gonna align yourself
with her?

593
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,688
I'm not aligned with anyone.

594
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:23,071
You know what?
I'm done protecting you.

595
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,591
Yeah, I got that.

596
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,758
Guess it's karma.

597
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:32,563
What Olivia said about Grady,

598
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:35,212
you let him bleed out and die,

599
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:38,266
the second I heard it,
I knew it was true.

600
00:31:38,876 --> 00:31:41,204
'Cause that's who
you really are, isn't it?

601
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:46,626
Are we done?

602
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:51,079
Lift up your skirt.

603
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,368
Yeah, we're done.

604
00:32:20,853 --> 00:32:22,829
I know you killed Travis.

605
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:25,610
I'm gonna prove it.

606
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,594
Okay, just relax.

607
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:45,305
Breathe in.

608
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,594
Breathe out.

609
00:32:49,485 --> 00:32:52,430
So?
Does the beat go on?

610
00:32:53,615 --> 00:32:55,133
It does.

611
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,383
It does.
Your vitals are good,

612
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:01,157
but don't exert yourself
too much today. Okay?

613
00:33:01,225 --> 00:33:03,126
Lean on us.
It's what we're here for.

614
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:04,315
Mm.

615
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:07,040
Before, when I thought
about my death,

616
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:11,878
I... the best I could imagine
was buying a one-way ticket

617
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,196
to Switzerland.

618
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:16,141
I would die there alone.

619
00:33:17,505 --> 00:33:19,222
But this...

620
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:22,954
Surrounded by everyone I love.

621
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,263
I'll be eternally grateful.

622
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:28,852
We're grateful to you, too,
Brendan.

623
00:33:28,946 --> 00:33:30,477
Me?
Why?

624
00:33:31,337 --> 00:33:32,823
For inviting us to the party.

625
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:34,078
Mm-hmm.

626
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,273
What up, bitches?

627
00:33:38,344 --> 00:33:40,430
All right, Mr. DeMille.

628
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:42,456
Are you ready
for your close up?

629
00:33:42,524 --> 00:33:44,531
A woman after my own heart.

630
00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:48,630
I'm next.

631
00:33:48,774 --> 00:33:50,026
And just so you know,

632
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,167
gold is my color.

633
00:33:51,235 --> 00:33:52,656
Oh.

634
00:33:56,697 --> 00:33:59,203
I'm so glad you're here.

635
00:34:00,781 --> 00:34:02,336
Me, too.

636
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:06,344
You crazy kids still need
a name for this place?

637
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,150
Well, Des's last pitch was
Home of the Grave,

638
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:10,672
so, yeah.

639
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:13,172
'Cause I was thinking, uh...

640
00:34:13,936 --> 00:34:15,358
Joy's.

641
00:34:17,565 --> 00:34:19,649
That's perfect.

642
00:34:21,245 --> 00:34:23,711
I think Mom would like it.

643
00:34:31,617 --> 00:34:33,441
I'll be back in a minute.

644
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:46,508
I would die here.

645
00:34:47,454 --> 00:34:49,610
We'll put you on the wait list.

646
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,402
I thought we were done
with the appliances.

647
00:35:01,622 --> 00:35:02,997
It's your pento.

648
00:35:03,606 --> 00:35:05,247
Enough for a lifetime.

649
00:35:05,872 --> 00:35:08,013
I'm a woman of my word.

650
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:11,935
Thank you.

651
00:35:19,724 --> 00:35:21,778
So you're gonna
kill someone here?

652
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:23,858
It's a closed event.

653
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:25,849
Loved ones only.

654
00:35:26,814 --> 00:35:28,716
I can respect that.

655
00:35:29,971 --> 00:35:31,755
You really should.

656
00:35:33,294 --> 00:35:35,158
I meant what I said, Mary.

657
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:37,927
I admire you.

658
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:40,466
In the middle of all of this,

659
00:35:40,544 --> 00:35:42,294
you never lost control.

660
00:35:43,117 --> 00:35:44,927
And you got everything
you wanted.

661
00:35:45,528 --> 00:35:49,849
Made me realize I'd been far
too dependent on other people.

662
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:55,435
Which is why you should know
I kept a box of pento for myself.

663
00:35:56,968 --> 00:35:58,393
Why?

664
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,028
So I don't have to call you
every time I have a problem.

665
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,935
And we've still got
a few problems.

666
00:36:10,278 --> 00:36:12,073
I'll see you around, Mary.

667
00:37:28,485 --> 00:37:29,978
There you are.

668
00:37:30,587 --> 00:37:32,220
I just needed a minute.

669
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,165
You look nervous.

670
00:37:34,743 --> 00:37:37,282
Yeah, well,
what we're about to do is

671
00:37:37,828 --> 00:37:39,634
a little more elaborate
than usual.

672
00:37:39,853 --> 00:37:41,517
It does seem...

673
00:37:41,978 --> 00:37:43,532
A bit terrifying.

674
00:37:44,071 --> 00:37:46,165
In our own messy way,
it feels kind of...

675
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:47,845
Inevitable.

676
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:53,417
Last I heard, our stage manager

677
00:37:53,485 --> 00:37:54,885
was calling a rehearsal.

678
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:57,041
Hollering, more like.

679
00:37:57,243 --> 00:37:59,469

- I'll be right there.

before you die</i>

722
00:41:14,236 --> 00:41:17,525
you see your life,
a spat of film strip,

723
00:41:17,721 --> 00:41:20,049
the bad and good,

724
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:24,104
nightmares and dreams,

725
00:41:25,244 --> 00:41:27,338
<i>unfolding before you.</i>

726
00:41:36,207 --> 00:41:39,590
Your first dog.
Your first cigarette.

727
00:41:40,324 --> 00:41:41,902
Your first love.

728
00:41:46,699 --> 00:41:49,246
<i>A friend who became a stranger.</i>

729
00:41:50,117 --> 00:41:52,707
The tree you planted
when you were five.

730
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:57,410
These moments come up
and grab you.

731
00:41:57,595 --> 00:41:59,574
Live and steady.

732
00:41:59,827 --> 00:42:02,219
And then they let go.

733
00:42:02,496 --> 00:42:04,592
Receding into the past.

734
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:10,965
Before parting ways,

735
00:42:11,105 --> 00:42:13,246
your body is weightless,

736
00:42:13,558 --> 00:42:17,552
hovering in place for what
feels like an eternity.

737
00:42:19,051 --> 00:42:22,209
This is so you have
enough time to say good-bye.

738
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,226
But you don't realize it.

739
00:42:29,522 --> 00:42:31,584
Because it's all of a moment.

740
00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:36,105
A speck in time
in which you exist.

741
00:42:40,028 --> 00:42:41,613
<i>And then not.</i>

742
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:45,387
Just a moment.

743
00:42:47,084 --> 00:42:48,980
Before it's all over.

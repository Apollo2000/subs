1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,889
Hey, this is joel collins. I met a nurse
named annie. How did you get this number?

2
00:00:04,913 --> 00:00:06,480
She said you could help me.

3
00:00:06,515 --> 00:00:08,582
I believe we should be in
control of our life.

4
00:00:08,617 --> 00:00:12,052
And our death. That's liberty.

5
00:00:12,087 --> 00:00:13,553
And dying isn't a crime.

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:16,123
No, but helping people die
makes you a criminal.

7
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:17,691
<i>My god. You had sex with him.</i>

8
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:18,770
And now you think you two are
gonna live.

9
00:00:18,794 --> 00:00:20,994
Happily ever after. He's dying.

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,095
Can you tell me again?

11
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:23,964
You told me how they do it in
switzerland,

12
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:26,800
But I really want to hear how
you're gonna do it.

13
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:29,169
Des, he's a cop.
I almost killed him.

14
00:00:29,204 --> 00:00:31,004
Get out now.

15
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,540
She's by her car,
can't see what she's doing.

16
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,475
Please don't go. Augh!

17
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,045
God, des, say something!

18
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,013
I really think
we need to help charlie.

19
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,985
Sid, would you get dr. Mary
harris of 228 maple drive.

20
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,453
What she came here for tonight?

21
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:47,821
Smile.

22
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:49,222
You sound like your mom.

23
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:51,158
<i>I told her I took her drugs
from the shed,</i>

24
00:00:51,193 --> 00:00:53,393
<i>And she said
she wouldn't tell anyone.</i>

25
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,228
If I cleaned up my act.

26
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,264
Wait. She knew about it?

27
00:00:56,298 --> 00:00:59,399
I, troy dixon,
choose to take my life.

28
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:02,769
I think you might know
my husband, troy dixon.

29
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:05,205
You don't get to play god, mary.

30
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
None of us do.

31
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,275
You got the wrong girl.

32
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,409
<i>Listen to me.</i>

33
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:12,312
Right now,
they don't have anything on us.

34
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:14,648
So we just need to be smarter.

35
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:06,099
I thought death always knocked
three times.

36
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:10,303
Guess you're safe... For now.

37
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,139
Larissa? Still asleep.

38
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,007
God, she sleeps like a teenager.

39
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:15,308
She is a teenager.

40
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,177
Yeah.

41
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:18,945
It's for after irene,

42
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:21,248
Assuming we don't end up in
jail.

43
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:22,482
New patient, new phone.

44
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,352
Smarter.

45
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:27,521
You know, I was thinking about
irene.

46
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:30,924
If my family had the gene,
I'd want to know.

47
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,425
I say wait for the symptoms.

48
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:35,228
Yeah, in the meantime, eat,
shag, and be merry.

49
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:36,574
Wouldn't you want to know
what kind of future.

50
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:38,098
You're facing? God no.

51
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:39,332
No, ignorance is bliss.

52
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:41,902
So early.

53
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:43,904
Morning, sleepy.
There's coffee in the kitchen.

54
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:45,038
We're off. Okay.

55
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:47,641
Keys? They're on the table.

56
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,910
Good luck.

57
00:02:52,314 --> 00:02:55,816
So domestic.

58
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,559
Hey, here she is.

59
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:09,563
She's leaving.

60
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:18,638
Don't get your hopes up.

61
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:21,107
She hasn't killed anyone in over
a week, right?

62
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:25,879
Must've been so hard for her.

63
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:37,424
All right, mary, where are you
taking us?

64
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,700
Yeah, that's the same nursing
home surveillance saw her.

65
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:49,603
Going through a few days ago.

66
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:51,071
She visit anyone?

67
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:55,175
Yeah, visitor's log says 103.

68
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:01,781
It's on the left.

69
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:04,417
Right here. Right here.

70
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,019
"Exposing her milky white..."

71
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,521
Can I help you?

72
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:10,023
What's happening, larissa?

73
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:11,736
I don't know, grandma.
I'm detective gaines.

74
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,393
This is my partner, detective
wesley.

75
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:14,728
You can't just barge in here.

76
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:16,441
You could've given my
grandma another stroke.

77
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,865
Apologies, but we're looking
for dr. Mary harris.

78
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:20,467
We have reason to believe she's
here.

79
00:04:20,502 --> 00:04:22,869
No, mary lent me her car to
visit my grandmother.

80
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:24,504
She hardly ever comes to visit.

81
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:26,306
I have to wait forever between
chapters.

82
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:27,986
Yeah, because I don't have a
car, grandma; I told you that.

83
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,477
Okay, do you know where mary
is right now?

84
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:32,078
No, I barely even know her.

85
00:04:32,114 --> 00:04:33,524
I mean, I, like, try to be
friends with her,

86
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:35,782
But she's aloof, like a cat.

87
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,019
That's why it was weird that she
lent me her car, but, you know,

88
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:40,086
People can surprise you.

89
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:41,755
So can cats.

90
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,623
So you have no idea where she
is?

91
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,892
She left with my
boyfriend des this morning.

92
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:48,295
But I don't know
where they went.

93
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:56,336
Are they in some kind of
trouble?

94
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:13,720
Hi.

95
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:15,855
We started early.

96
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:17,924
I hope you don't mind.

97
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,025
Not at all, no.

98
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:21,328
Day drinking is a highly
respected pastime.

99
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,263
Where I come from.

100
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,734
How are you feeling, irene?

101
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:30,971
I woke up this morning.

102
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:34,874
Feeling incredibly peaceful.

103
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,378
Said she hasn't felt this way
since our wedding day.

104
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:41,381
Is that a compliment?

105
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,384
People always talk about
jitters,

106
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:48,154
But I never had any of that.

107
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,024
On my wedding day,

108
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,761
I felt absolutely certain.

109
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:57,530
We were making the right
decision.

110
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:01,968
To spend our lives together.

111
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,050
You look beautiful, irene.

112
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:53,753
Well, you never know who
you're going to see.

113
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,989
On the other side.

114
00:07:01,763 --> 00:07:05,732
I know what I want my last words
to be.

115
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:07,534
Are we ready?

116
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:11,538
We are.

117
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:20,113
There is beauty in the
inevitable.

118
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:42,368
This car smells like cherries.

119
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:43,436
Can we keep it?

120
00:07:43,472 --> 00:07:45,872
No, honey. It's a rental.

121
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:47,474
Hi, dr. Harris.

122
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,608
Hi, naomi.

123
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:49,954
My mom just wanted to say
thank you.

124
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:52,879
For letting me stay
over this weekend.

125
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:55,215
No problem.

126
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:58,251
Sweet ride.

127
00:07:58,286 --> 00:08:01,121
It's a rental.

128
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:02,322
So what are they doing?

129
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,657
Are they going on a
trip or something?

130
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,025
No. My mom's just, like,

131
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:08,139
Obsessed with design shows,
so she's helping kevin...

132
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:10,130
We got to go get educated.

133
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:12,265
Have a nice day.
My mom is such a liar, okay?

134
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,399
We're skipping school.

135
00:08:15,137 --> 00:08:17,871
Wait. I wrote a poem.

136
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:19,266
Can I read it?
Yeah, let's hear it.

137
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,911
"The spark turned cold,
a darkness bright.

138
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:27,914
"You had no voice,
we had no choice.

139
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:29,983
A ghost in my heart."

140
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:31,484
It's about casper.

141
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,853
Do you like it?

142
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,524
Cambie, it's really good.

143
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,460
Thanks.

144
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,470
I'll see you after school, okay?

145
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:51,571
Okay.

146
00:08:51,606 --> 00:08:54,607
Have a nice day.

147
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:09,355
<i>Hello? - Hi, ben. It's mary.</i>

148
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:10,990
I need to talk to you.

149
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,226
<i>But not here.</i>

150
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:29,609
You look well.

151
00:09:29,644 --> 00:09:31,255
You know, I've had about all
the games I can take.

152
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,081
For one morning, mary,
so what do you want?

153
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,550
I need your advice.

154
00:09:37,586 --> 00:09:41,421
Everywhere I go lately,
I feel like I'm being watched.

155
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,557
So I've thinking, maybe I have a
stalker.

156
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:46,726
Maybe he's dangerous.

157
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:48,294
Should I file a police report?

158
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,796
Yeah, you should.

159
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:52,432
I can have officers
at your home, at the hospital.

160
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,768
Anywhere you go, the cops will
be right there.

161
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,876
Why can't you just accept that
you were wrong about me,

162
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:06,679
That I'm just a doctor who
sometimes volunteers.

163
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:09,115
With the terminally ill and that
you're just a cop.

164
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,351
With a bad lead?

165
00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:14,220
And we just ride off into the
sunset.

166
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:16,723
Or maybe get a drink?

167
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:21,761
A week ago, you were ready to
give me.

168
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:24,998
Some kind of eternal cocktail.

169
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:26,410
If you hadn't figured out I was
a cop,

170
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:28,001
You'd be in jail right now.

171
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:30,336
Or maybe I'd be talking to my
lawyer about how the cop.

172
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:31,682
Who was supposed
to be investigating me.

173
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:33,072
Had sex with me instead.

174
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:35,041
I can live with that. I can.

175
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:36,643
But can you live
with what you've done?

176
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,578
I haven't done anything.

177
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:42,749
My only crime was to feel sorry
for a desperate, dying man.

178
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:44,884
Do you feel sorry for all of
your patients, mary,

179
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,486
Or was I special?

180
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:52,258
You were the one that got away.

181
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:57,730
What messed you up, mary?

182
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:01,234
What? What messed you up?

183
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:02,902
You think you're above the law.

184
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:04,837
You're risking your life, your
daughter's life.

185
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,206
What messed you up?

186
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:11,110
You deceive people for a living.

187
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:13,946
Ben... is that still your name?

188
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,251
You do what you want,

189
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:19,497
But I think it's in your best
interest.

190
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:20,653
If this case goes away.

191
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:39,205
<i>I was awake all night.</i>

192
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,342
Worrying about irene,
about everything.

193
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:44,811
It was perfect.

194
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,114
No cops this time?

195
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,951
Would I be handing you this
envelope if there were?

196
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:54,520
I told you, the cops
don't have anything on us,

197
00:11:54,556 --> 00:11:59,192
And I know how to stay ahead of
them.

198
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:01,005
But, annie, I don't want you
lying awake all night.

199
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:04,230
If you can't do
this anymore, I get it.

200
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:13,106
Morgan lewis.

201
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:15,041
Cystic fibrosis.

202
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:18,978
33. He's young.

203
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:20,580
Well, I've been treating him
for years.

204
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,715
He was in here last week.
He said that he feels like.

205
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:25,785
He's drowning in slow motion.

206
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,020
He's ready.

207
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:32,225
You know I started carrying
my passport around?

208
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,328
Just in case.

209
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,896
Where would you go?

210
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:39,832
China, I guess.

211
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:41,567
The devil you know, right?

212
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,241
Are we crazy?

213
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:51,377
Yep.

214
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,585
We need a new plan.

215
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:01,087
She'll slip up. They always do.

216
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:02,321
No, man, she's different.

217
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:04,023
She's smart. She's careful.

218
00:13:04,058 --> 00:13:06,025
She knows what to say,
what not to say,

219
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,338
The whole counseling cover
story.

220
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:08,761
Yeah, you're right.

221
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:11,264
There's no way that joel was her
only patient after ethan.

222
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,266
No, no way.
There's got to be more.

223
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:14,534
I have an idea.

224
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:17,270
Let's run through our
sudden-death reports,

225
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:20,072
See if any connect back to eden
general.

226
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:22,241
Okay.

227
00:13:26,714 --> 00:13:28,354
<i>I still don't understand how
you got this.</i>

228
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,851
You said you work with
kids, but then you hardly ever.

229
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:33,453
Leave the apartment, except with
mary.

230
00:13:33,488 --> 00:13:39,425
And then the shoulder,
the cops...

231
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:40,771
If we're gonna be in a
relationship,

232
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:46,065
I think you should
be honest with me.

233
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,535
Okay.

234
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:52,538
Okay, listen,

235
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:56,342
Truth is, I don't work
with kids.

236
00:13:56,377 --> 00:14:00,012
Mary and I are
end-of-life counselors.

237
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,048
We... we help people who are
dying.

238
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,852
We talk to them,
show them their options.

239
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,987
Dark.

240
00:14:08,022 --> 00:14:10,056
Yeah. Yeah, it is, sure,

241
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:13,392
But that's why I didn't tell you
about it in the first place.

242
00:14:13,428 --> 00:14:16,462
But you know what?
Now that we're talking about it,

243
00:14:16,498 --> 00:14:19,765
We're thinking about
opening up our own practice,

244
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:23,703
A haven
for the hopeless, if you will.

245
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,305
That is so great, des.

246
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:27,618
It's like with my grandma,
you know?

247
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:29,675
Sometimes all she wants is some
company.

248
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:38,117
Sharing is so hot.

249
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:39,385
Yes, it is.

250
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,089
<i>What do we have?</i>

251
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:46,025
Sid thomas-haye, gunshot wound
to the upper thigh.

252
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,171
Looks like a
through-and-through injury.

253
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:48,227
Vitals are stable.

254
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:51,731
Start an iv. Run normal saline.

255
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,244
Officers.
This patient's in our custody.

256
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,567
Yeah, I got that. What happened?

257
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,469
Caught him in a shoot-out in
south warren.

258
00:14:56,504 --> 00:15:00,373
Had some drugs on him, so he's
looking at five years.

259
00:15:00,408 --> 00:15:01,741
Look, I get you have a job to
do,

260
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:02,786
But can you give us a bit of
space?

261
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,477
All right, sorry.

262
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,990
Relax your eyes.

263
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,997
I know you.

264
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:26,832
Let's get a mask on him.
I know you.

265
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:30,503
Put your head down.
Breathe deeply.

266
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,542
Okay, get an x-ray to make sure
there's no bone damage,

267
00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:39,378
5 milligrams of morphine,
and draw blood work.

268
00:15:39,414 --> 00:15:40,880
Got it.

269
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,865
[M beeps]

270
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,767
<i>Dr. Harris to icu.</i>

271
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:54,502
<i>Dr. Harris to icu.</i>

272
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,303
What about the risks?

273
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:57,972
Well, sure, it's another
operation,

274
00:15:58,007 --> 00:16:00,241
So there's always a possibility
of complications.

275
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:02,076
Organ damage, stroke, death.

276
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:03,711
Someone's been googling?

277
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:06,881
Matt, you just have to have
faith that dr. Taylor's.

278
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,849
Gonna bring you through this.
Right, doctor?

279
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,985
Hi, sonia. Matt.

280
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,164
Matt's gonna have his surgery
tomorrow.

281
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:14,355
For one second can we talk
about a complication.

282
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,290
And I end up in a coma or...

283
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:17,958
Or breathing through a tube or
something.

284
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:19,093
I don't want that.

285
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:21,295
Well, that's very, very
unlikely.

286
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,898
But it's possible, right?

287
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:28,969
Yes, it is possible.

288
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:31,806
And it's normal to be playing
out worst-case scenarios.

289
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:33,607
In times like this.

290
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:36,610
But I assure you you've got the
best doctor in the city.

291
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:38,279
You're in great hands.

292
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:42,983
My goodness.

293
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,852
Matt. What's going on?

294
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,020
Matt? Matt.

295
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:47,299
The wound in the heart has
reopened.

296
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:48,634
Let's get him to the o.R.
Stay with me.

297
00:16:48,658 --> 00:16:52,660
We are gonna take matt down to
surgery right now.

298
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:54,428
Matt. Let's go. Let's go.

299
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:55,863
Find out what o.R. Is open.

300
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:57,932
Don't you worry. We're gonna
take good care of him.

301
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:01,135
Let's go. Let's move it.

302
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:10,244
These are depressing the
out of me.

303
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,048
Yeah, it's like some morbid
game of "where's waldo?"

304
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,287
There are a lot of suicides.

305
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:23,090
Yeah, this woman starved
herself to death.

306
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:27,561
53, severe stroke, paralyzed,
except for one hand,

307
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:31,065
Which she used to pull the
feeding tube out every time.

308
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,666
Her care worker put it in.

309
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:34,768
Care worker's only doing her
job, man.

310
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,582
Yeah, I know, but, I mean,
I'm just saying, you know,

311
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:39,440
Who has the right to decide when
it's your time to go?

312
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,041
Certainly not mary.

313
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,978
Yeah.

314
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,448
Troy dixon.

315
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,050
Why do I know that name?

316
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:52,253
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

317
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:02,296
Okay, watch your back.
We're coming through.

318
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,564
Thank god.

319
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,344
He's been whining for a doctor
for a half hour.

320
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:06,433
Busy day.

321
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:09,670
How soon do you think he can
be discharged?

322
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:11,038
Probably tomorrow morning.

323
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:13,073
If we can keep him alive until
then.

324
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:14,508
We have to.

325
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:17,511
Then we get him tied to his
shooter, and we're golden.

326
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:24,118
Doc, I got a bad feeling.

327
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:25,452
In my chest,

328
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:28,822
And my heart is beating really
fast.

329
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,593
Kay, let me listen.

330
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,504
That feeling in your chest,
it's anxiety,

331
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,272
Pretty common after something
like this.

332
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:48,409
Maybe you should do some more
tests.

333
00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:50,911
We already have.
Your x-rays show no.

334
00:18:50,947 --> 00:18:52,513
Bullet fragments or bone damage.

335
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,349
I think maybe I should stay
here.

336
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,684
You're fine.

337
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,086
You'll be able to limp out of
here tomorrow.

338
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:01,288
Great.

339
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:03,924
You ever see a dead man walking?

340
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,801
Try to get some rest, okay?

341
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:16,036
You've been through a lot.

342
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,974
Hey, I figured it out.

343
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:23,577
You came by grady's place last
week.

344
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:26,380
You bought a ton of barbs.

345
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,717
Mouse ears.

346
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:34,455
No, that wasn't me.

347
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,789
Troy dixon, the football player?

348
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:36,857
Yeah, I remember him.

349
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:38,692
We don't often get celebrities.

350
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:40,160
Pancreatic cancer.

351
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:42,129
It's an ugly disease,
a real dog.

352
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:44,343
Yeah, I'm sure. Look, it says
I in your coroner's report.

353
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:45,632
That he had bloodshot eyes.

354
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:48,068
Yeah, you often see blood
around the irises.

355
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,548
When a patient's
struggling to breath.

356
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:54,041
Okay, but that can also be a
sign of overdose, right?

357
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:56,076
What are you implying,
detective?

358
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,779
Well, I'm... i'm just saying I
can see why someone in troy's.

359
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:00,359
Case may want to check out a
little early.

360
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,593
And I'm trying to rule out
whether he had.

361
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,083
A little help or not.

362
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,954
Well, that's my job, and
I did rule it out.

363
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:10,424
Troy dixon was in the late
stages of a terminal disease.

364
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,959
His wife confirmed that his
breathing.

365
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:13,494
Had been labored that day,

366
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:16,263
And I concluded it was natural
causes.

367
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,132
And you're absolutely sure?

368
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:19,933
We have a saying in my line of
work.

369
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:23,570
"If you hear hoofbeats,
think horse, not zebra."

370
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,720
Relax.

371
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:41,989
I told them I was your brother.

372
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:43,223
I don't have a brother.

373
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,436
Couldn't tell them I was here
to see sid,

374
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,628
Not with all these police
around.

375
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,597
You know, I never should have
sent him into south warren.

376
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:52,766
I saw this opportunity to expand
my business,

377
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:56,036
And I thought he could handle
it.

378
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:58,272
This is my fault.
He's gonna be okay.

379
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:00,340
We're just waiting on a few more
tests.

380
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:05,212
I need you to be straight with
me, mary.

381
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:07,381
But I don't give a about this.

382
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,916
Patient-doctor confidentiality.

383
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:11,452
You tell me the truth.

384
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:13,053
Really, he's gonna be fine.

385
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,725
All right.

386
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:19,793
Thank you.

387
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:24,465
Thank you.

388
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,202
I'm just doing my job.

389
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:30,337
You know, the police think
they're heroes.

390
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,606
Going after a guy like sid.

391
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:33,919
But they don't want to do
anything about the beast.

392
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:38,612
That's inside the addict
demanding to be fed.

393
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:40,147
They just want to pull away the
plate.

394
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:41,915
I really have to get back to
work now.

395
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:46,920
I need you to get sid out.

396
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:52,793
Either the guy that runs south
warren is gonna finish the job,

397
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:55,329
Or the police are gonna lock him
up.

398
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:58,599
And this is on me, and I need to
protect him.

399
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:00,701
That's not my problem.

400
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:07,674
I think you're gonna do what I'm
asking you, mary.

401
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,676
I'm not helping you.

402
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,485
Only when cornered.

403
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:28,032
I turned around,
and he was right there.

404
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,288
I can't just ignore him.

405
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:30,656
Yes, you can. You have to.

406
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:33,893
He has on us, on me.

407
00:22:33,928 --> 00:22:36,495
We don't know if he's gonna use
it to get what he wants.

408
00:22:36,531 --> 00:22:39,098
Grady can't expose you without
exposing himself.

409
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:41,367
He won't risk it.

410
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,135
We need a new supplier.
Great idea.

411
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:45,204
I'll put an ad in the paper.
Des, I'm serious.

412
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,906
I don't need another reason to
be looking.

413
00:22:46,941 --> 00:22:48,240
Over my shoulder right now.

414
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:50,020
Okay, look, we have enough
pento to get through.

415
00:22:50,044 --> 00:22:51,344
The next few jobs, right?

416
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:54,547
I'll look for a more affable
drug dealer,

417
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:58,551
But in the meantime,
you stay away from grady, okay?

418
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:02,455
Then we can focus on what
matters.

419
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,857
Morgan lewis.

420
00:23:04,892 --> 00:23:08,060
Cystic fibrosis.

421
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:15,001
You know, carly,
I saw your husband.

422
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:16,435
Play football in college.

423
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:18,671
He had a 75-yard once.

424
00:23:18,706 --> 00:23:19,772
I was at that game.

425
00:23:19,807 --> 00:23:20,973
He almost set a record.

426
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:23,676
He had a real gift.

427
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:26,312
So what is this about?

428
00:23:26,347 --> 00:23:29,915
Well, troy was treated at eden
general, correct?

429
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:34,754
He ever talk to you about any of
his doctors or nurses?

430
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,522
I mean, the staff loved him.

431
00:23:36,557 --> 00:23:39,525
He took pictures,
signed autographs.

432
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,994
But when it got really bad, he
just wanted to go home.

433
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,031
He didn't want people to
remember him like that.

434
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:47,199
His medical record said he had
about six months,

435
00:23:47,235 --> 00:23:48,868
Maybe even a year.

436
00:23:48,903 --> 00:23:50,547
Didn't find it a little strange
that he died.

437
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:52,405
Only after two months?

438
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,973
Only two months?

439
00:23:54,008 --> 00:23:55,207
Try two years.

440
00:23:55,243 --> 00:23:57,176
That's how long he spent
fighting.

441
00:23:57,211 --> 00:24:00,946
I understand that troy was
alone when he died.

442
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,883
He thought I needed a break.

443
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:05,151
And he seemed fine.

444
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:06,830
Well, you told the coroner
that his breathing.

445
00:24:06,854 --> 00:24:09,355
Had been labored all day.

446
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:11,157
What is this really about?

447
00:24:11,192 --> 00:24:12,936
Well, we're just trying to
clarify the circumstances.

448
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,860
Of your husband's death.

449
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:16,762
Troy had cancer.

450
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:18,230
He died.

451
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:20,166
Seems pretty clear to me.

452
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:24,637
I'd like to go now.

453
00:24:27,442 --> 00:24:30,009
Well, there are other ways to
get information on troy.

454
00:24:30,044 --> 00:24:31,677
She's hiding something.
Damn straight.

455
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:33,223
She was probably sitting right
there when it happened.

456
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:35,292
If she helped, it will mess up
that life insurance check.

457
00:24:35,316 --> 00:24:36,849
Yeah, exactly.

458
00:24:38,286 --> 00:24:40,186
Dr. Harris.

459
00:24:40,221 --> 00:24:43,456
Sonia, hi. How are you doing?

460
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:45,825
Are you okay?

461
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,661
He was... he was buying me a bike.

462
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:51,831
Off craigslist, you know?

463
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,399
That's why he was getting out
cash.

464
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:57,903
That's why... I mean, 'cause I
wanted a stupid vintage bike.

465
00:24:57,939 --> 00:24:59,905
It's not your fault.

466
00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:03,642
He's on life support.

467
00:25:03,678 --> 00:25:08,214
But dr. Taylor says there are
more surgeries that can be done.

468
00:25:09,684 --> 00:25:13,185
He needs my consent.

469
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:18,324
I know what... what matt said
before the surgery.

470
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,028
But I think he was really
scared,

471
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:26,832
And... and he had lost his faith.

472
00:25:26,868 --> 00:25:29,735
And I couldn't live with myself
if I made a decision.

473
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,438
Based one something he said in a
moment of fear.

474
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:36,275
Well, what should I do?

475
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,778
It's not for me to decide.

476
00:25:39,814 --> 00:25:40,846
But you're a doctor.

477
00:25:40,882 --> 00:25:43,048
You deal with this stuff every
day.

478
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:46,619
How... how do you decide when to
keep going.

479
00:25:46,654 --> 00:25:49,355
Or when to stop?

480
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:55,561
You know, a patient said to me
once,

481
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:59,665
"there's beauty in the
inevitable."

482
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,268
She was facing death,
and she had accepted that.

483
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:04,303
She had come to the end.

484
00:26:04,338 --> 00:26:07,006
And there was more that I could
have done for her as a doctor,

485
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:10,976
But it wasn't my place to
question her decision.

486
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:14,580
It's like ecclesiastes 3:11.

487
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:17,116
I don't know that one.

488
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:21,954
"He has made everything
beautiful in its time."

489
00:26:21,989 --> 00:26:24,290
God has a plan.

490
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:27,226
And it's not our place to
question it.

491
00:26:27,261 --> 00:26:30,963
We just have to trust in his
wisdom.

492
00:26:34,435 --> 00:26:37,069
Then there's your answer.

493
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:42,975
<i>I've been obsessing about it
all week.</i>

494
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,277
<i>I don't know.
I mean, it makes sense,</i>

495
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:48,547
The phone, the cash, the drugs.

496
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,816
Yeah. These eggs are gross.

497
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:53,652
And she lied for you,
which is crazy.

498
00:26:53,688 --> 00:26:56,222
I... i don't know what I should
do, like...

499
00:26:56,257 --> 00:26:57,990
Don't do anything, okay?

500
00:26:58,025 --> 00:27:00,159
The best thing to do when your
mom's a drug dealer.

501
00:27:00,194 --> 00:27:02,361
Is to just pretend it's not
happening.

502
00:27:02,396 --> 00:27:03,896
Yeah, but it's dangerous if
she...

503
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:06,632
Jess, you can't tell anyone,
okay?

504
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,868
It would ruin your life,
and mine.

505
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:13,405
Yeah. So...

506
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:16,041
Any idea how we're going to pay
for this?

507
00:27:16,077 --> 00:27:18,110
Thought you had money.

508
00:27:18,145 --> 00:27:20,112
I lied.

509
00:27:20,147 --> 00:27:23,449
It's okay.
We can just dine and dash.

510
00:27:23,484 --> 00:27:25,017
You're insane. No.

511
00:27:26,554 --> 00:27:28,420
Naomi. Naomi. No, no, no, no.

512
00:27:28,456 --> 00:27:30,623
Come on. What are you doing?

513
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:36,795
Ladies, you forget to settle up?

514
00:27:36,831 --> 00:27:38,998
No, we left the money on
the counter.

515
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,432
Hey, hey, stop.

516
00:27:40,468 --> 00:27:44,770
Hey, you two, stop. Stop.

517
00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:48,707
What seems to be the problem?

518
00:27:48,743 --> 00:27:50,442
This doesn't concern you, sir.

519
00:27:50,478 --> 00:27:52,378
Well, these are my nieces,
so yes,

520
00:27:52,413 --> 00:27:54,413
I think it concerns me.

521
00:27:54,448 --> 00:27:57,583
These girls left without paying.

522
00:27:59,153 --> 00:28:02,888
Girls, I told you to wait inside
for me.

523
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:08,994
You know, these girls are...
They're home-schooled,

524
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,364
So things fall between the
cracks.

525
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,634
So what... what do you need, 20,
30 bucks?

526
00:28:16,937 --> 00:28:17,970
40.

527
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,573
You girls ate a lot?

528
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,047
Make sure the waiter gets
tipped.

529
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,455
My god. Thank you.

530
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,456
Yeah, thanks.

531
00:28:37,491 --> 00:28:39,792
Who are you?

532
00:28:39,827 --> 00:28:41,593
Why... why did you do that?

533
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:44,530
Well, maybe I'm a good
samaritan.

534
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,271
I was sure she'd pick chad,
but she chose brandon.

535
00:28:52,306 --> 00:28:56,742
No matter how many times you
tell me, it'll never matter.

536
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,977
But it's the final rose.

537
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,150
<i>Hello. - Hi, mary.</i>

538
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:07,986
<i>Check your messages.</i>

539
00:29:08,022 --> 00:29:12,324
How did you get this number?

540
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,020
We're moving you to a private
room.

541
00:29:33,055 --> 00:29:34,655
Why? What's going on?

542
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,930
He doesn't need immediate
attention, and we need the bed,

543
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,325
So we're sending him to icu.

544
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,128
They know he's coming.

545
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:57,055
Excuse me, we're gonna need to
ride with him.

546
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:58,412
No more room. Take the next one.

547
00:29:58,447 --> 00:30:00,314
Room 141.

548
00:30:02,451 --> 00:30:04,217
<i>Chris daniels, call 156.</i>

549
00:30:04,253 --> 00:30:06,653
<i>Chris daniels, 156.</i>

550
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:08,188
Room 141.

551
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,663
Just before the chairs on your
right.

552
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,732
Okay, stand down.

553
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:23,203
I'm still alive.

554
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,006
You mind shutting the door on
the way out?

555
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:28,108
I'm gonna take a little nap.

556
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:30,744
I'm not sure I want to hear
about hull's date last night.

557
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,012
You jealous?

558
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:33,981
Guaranteed I get more women
than both of you.

559
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:58,438
Sid, come on.

560
00:30:58,474 --> 00:30:59,606
Put this on.

561
00:31:12,154 --> 00:31:13,320
What? Relax.

562
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:15,022
She's probably playing hard to
get.

563
00:31:15,057 --> 00:31:16,223
Probably.

564
00:31:16,258 --> 00:31:18,291
So what do you think a good
follow-up emoji is?

565
00:31:18,327 --> 00:31:20,093
Do that one. This one.

566
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,139
No, I'm not doing that.
That's just... no.

567
00:31:21,163 --> 00:31:22,662
Yeah, do it. Do it.

568
00:31:22,698 --> 00:31:23,663
What am I in grade six?

569
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:25,032
That one.

570
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:26,500
This one? Definitely.

571
00:31:26,535 --> 00:31:28,568
This?

572
00:31:32,574 --> 00:31:34,508
I'll take him from here.

573
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:36,343
I thought I was doing this.

574
00:31:36,378 --> 00:31:38,912
I need to end this.

575
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:51,458
Open the door.

576
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:59,332
I think I should put you on
the payroll, dr. Harris.

577
00:32:04,473 --> 00:32:05,605
Okay, we're done.

578
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:07,641
And if you ever go near my
family again,

579
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,054
I'm calling the cops.
Come on, mary.

580
00:32:09,078 --> 00:32:11,111
Us criminals have to stick
together.

581
00:32:16,118 --> 00:32:19,052
Drive.

582
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:38,338
I have to go now.

583
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,844
Stay.

584
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,051
Thanks for this, man.

585
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:52,853
I owe you one.

586
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,657
What were you doing in south
warren, sid?

587
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:02,362
I was meeting a new client...

588
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,999
A potential new client.

589
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,071
What did you think was gonna
happen,

590
00:33:11,106 --> 00:33:13,440
That you could just steal my
product and walk into south

591
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:15,675
Warren, and they're gonna
welcome you with open arms?

592
00:33:18,147 --> 00:33:19,779
This really doesn't concern me.

593
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:21,715
I work hard to stay clean.

594
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,850
I run my business.
I pay my taxes.

595
00:33:23,886 --> 00:33:27,387
And now you're in the system
again.

596
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,656
And see, I can do that math,
sid.

597
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:31,458
Two drugs convictions plus a
weapons charge.

598
00:33:31,493 --> 00:33:33,071
That equals you making a deal
with the police.

599
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:34,928
Come on, grady.

600
00:33:34,963 --> 00:33:37,464
Look, I know I've done some
stupid, all right?

601
00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:39,399
But I would never do that.

602
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,236
I'll do the time.

603
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:45,739
You drop me to the police
station right now.

604
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:49,276
It's too late.

605
00:33:53,415 --> 00:33:54,548
You can go.

606
00:33:57,753 --> 00:33:59,252
Take care of that leg, okay?

607
00:34:00,689 --> 00:34:02,989
Fresh bandages every day.

608
00:34:03,025 --> 00:34:05,425
Keep it elevated to reduce the
swelling.

609
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,593
We have a coroner's letter to
release all the documents.

610
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:03,450
Pertaining to troy dixon,

611
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:05,752
Nurses, doctors, anyone who
might have come into contact.

612
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:07,020
With him while he was here.

613
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:08,855
What is this regarding?

614
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,924
It's regarding an ongoing
investigation.

615
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:14,561
We can't get into details right
now.

616
00:35:14,596 --> 00:35:15,596
All right, stay here.

617
00:35:15,631 --> 00:35:18,765
I'm gonna make a phone call.

618
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,735
Excuse me.

619
00:35:24,673 --> 00:35:26,172
I have to go. Wait a minute.

620
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,742
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

621
00:35:28,777 --> 00:35:31,044
I can't... i can't do this right
now.

622
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,379
What's wrong? Nothing.

623
00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:35,548
I... i... I just have to get home
to my kids right now.

624
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:37,450
Okay, okay, okay, just wait.

625
00:35:37,486 --> 00:35:41,821
Okay, look, just let me give you
my number, okay?

626
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:44,624
This is my personal cell.

627
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,660
If you need anything...

628
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:50,297
If you need anything at all,
you just call, all right?

629
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,902
Improvising.

630
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:13,003
Did you get it? Yeah.

631
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:15,605
Let me see. Here.

632
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:18,775
I'm instagramming the
out of that.

633
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,043
Look at this one. All right.

634
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:21,144
Your turn now, darlin'.

635
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,245
No. Go, be a model.

636
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:23,446
No, no, no. I can't do that.

637
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:24,814
Look. Lookit.

638
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,983
Stop it.
Look at this one, though.

639
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:28,451
Hey, mom, look at this. So cute.

640
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:30,654
Okay, change of plans.
I have to work this weekend.

641
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,556
So go inside, pack your stuff.

642
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:35,825
I'm taking you to your dad's.

643
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,060
But you said we were gonna...

644
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:39,362
Cambie, we don't have time for
this; Go inside.

645
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:42,699
Jess, I need to talk to you.

646
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,301
I think she's in trouble.

647
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:46,603
I know you skipped school today.

648
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:47,815
What? I don't know what you're
talking about.

649
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,673
Don't even try.

650
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,586
Now, jess, when you're at
school, I know you're safe,

651
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,820
And when you're not, I don't
know that,

652
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:53,988
So you can't do that, all right?

653
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,712
You can't skip school.

654
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,647
You're such a hypocrite.

655
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:00,116
What's that supposed to mean?

656
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:03,887
Well, do think what you're
doing is really safe, mom?

657
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:19,336
Mary, hi.

658
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,804
Hi.

659
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:21,871
Is kevin here?

660
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,641
Kevin is at at the home depot.

661
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,242
Is everything okay?

662
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:28,378
Well, there's something going
around the hospital,

663
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:29,446
And we're short-staffed.

664
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,414
I've been called in. Okay.

665
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,850
The girls are in the car.

666
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:36,152
You have to work all weekend?
Yeah.

667
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:39,489
I know you two are working on
the house, but...

668
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,291
Free labor, right?

669
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:43,660
I'd be so grateful.
Of course. No problem at all.

670
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,895
Look, working mom. I get it.

671
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:49,566
Girls. Be happy to take them.

672
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,871
Hey, mom. Hey, sweetheart.

673
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:58,208
Bye, mary.

674
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,977
I'm so sorry I snapped at you
before, okay?

675
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:02,979
It's okay.

676
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:05,382
Like my lips?

677
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:08,385
I love them.

678
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,452
Go in.

679
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,758
Thank you. Yeah, no problem.

680
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,092
You know, I get it.

681
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:19,529
When I was single, I know,
it was super hard.

682
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:22,265
Yeah, it's really hard.

683
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:37,414
I thought you quit.

684
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:39,482
I did.

685
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:42,552
Took it up again, because...
Let's see.

686
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:45,622
Grady's using my daughter to
blackmail me.

687
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,257
The cops are all over the
hospital.

688
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:50,927
I lost my burner phone,
and yeah, sid's dead.

689
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:54,564
What... What happened?

690
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,901
See, that's exactly what I've
been trying to figure out,

691
00:38:57,936 --> 00:39:02,872
How I ended up risking my job
and my life and my kid.

692
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:05,141
To help a psycho drug dealer
murder someone.

693
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,676
Right in front of me.

694
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:09,512
And the only thing I could think
of is you.

695
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,650
Wait, you're blaming me for
this?

696
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,785
I wouldn't even know grady if
it weren't for you.

697
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:18,655
No, no, no, no, no.

698
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,368
You know grady, because you
wanted to start this business.

699
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:21,791
You brought me into this,
remember?

700
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:23,571
I brought you in because you
lost your medical license,

701
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:25,606
And I was trying to help you
feel like a doctor again.

702
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,297
No, bull.

703
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:28,998
This was never about me.

704
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,600
This was your crusade.

705
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:34,104
Because I wanted to help
people, give them a good death.

706
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:38,308
And to work out that
about your mom?

707
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:39,976
Your complex with the law.

708
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,711
Come on, admit it.

709
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:44,013
You get off on getting away with
it, don't you?

710
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,448
I care about people.

711
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:48,051
That's why I became a doctor,
a real doctor.

712
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,755
Easy, easy.

713
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,425
Okay, mary, yeah,
you're the real doctor.

714
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,371
You just care about people.
Everything's my fault.

715
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,673
Even though I'm the one that
told you.

716
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:00,196
To stay away from grady.

717
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:03,233
And I told you he came after
my kid.

718
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:06,236
I didn't have a choice.

719
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:11,040
I don't know.
I feel like you chose all of it.

720
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:11,467
Thanks for coming.

721
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,903
Yeah.

722
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:15,705
I was worried about you.

723
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,444
I saved some for you.

724
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:31,688
What's with the motel?

725
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:35,124
I don't know. I guess I needed
to get away from it all.

726
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:41,764
Things got complicated for you?

727
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:48,538
"Life is a ride in the dark."

728
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:51,174
That's what my mom used to say.

729
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:58,181
Why were you at the hospital?

730
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:00,316
I was working.

731
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,518
Why were you so upset?

732
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:10,393
I lost a patient.

733
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,395
Do you want to talk about it?

734
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,030
No.

735
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:22,872
Do you think that we could
ever truly be honest.

736
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:26,576
With each other?

737
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:30,813
No.

738
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:33,316
That was honest.

739
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:39,322
Why did you ask me here, mary?

740
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:40,623
I didn't want to be alone.

741
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:43,927
Why did you come?

742
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:36,079
Watch a new episode of mary kills
people, next wednesday on global.

go faster. Surf cheaper.

745
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,020
I don't think I've met anyone
like you in my life mary.

746
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:46,155
This perfect little doctor.

747
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:47,457
With a nice house.

748
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:48,858
And a pretty little daughter.

749
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,394
And you are right there
on the edge.

750
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:52,628
Yeah I am.

751
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,064
Your client is the primary
suspect.

752
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:56,599
In a murder investigation.

753
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:57,533
You need to stop.

754
00:43:57,535 --> 00:43:58,835
I don't want to stop.

755
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:00,737
I think there's something
wrong with me.

756
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:01,804
Mary harris,

757
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,940
She was investigated for the
murder of her mother.

758
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:05,341
No, her mother died of cancer.

759
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:06,843
She is manipulating you.

1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:03,139
Morgan Lewis. Cystic Fibrosis.

2
00:00:03,174 --> 00:00:04,273
He's ready.

3
00:00:04,308 --> 00:00:05,941
You collapsed during
your performance.

4
00:00:05,977 --> 00:00:07,442
Did you take anything?

5
00:00:07,478 --> 00:00:09,177
That stuff that was
in your shed.

6
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:11,813
- Is this your mom's?
- I just think

7
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:13,248
<i>- we should put it back.
- I do know</i>

8
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:16,584
that my mom is crazy,
and she is a lawyer.

9
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,387
Sid Thomas-Haye, gunshot wound
to the upper thigh.

10
00:00:19,422 --> 00:00:22,757
You came by Grady's place last
week, mouse ears.

11
00:00:22,793 --> 00:00:25,359
- I need you to get Sid out.
- That's not my problem.

12
00:00:25,395 --> 00:00:28,561
I think you're gonna do
what I'm asking you, Mary.

13
00:00:28,597 --> 00:00:30,475
- I'll take him from here.
- Two drug convictions

14
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:31,865
plus a weapons charge,
that equals

15
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:33,211
you making a deal
with the police.

16
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:34,868
Come on, Grady.

17
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:38,305
How I ended up risking my job,

18
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,775
my life, my kid
to help a psycho drug dealer

19
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:43,609
murder someone
right in front of me,

20
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,845
and the only thing
I could think of is you.

21
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,280
This is my number.

22
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:50,582
If you need anything at all,
you just... you call, all right?

23
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:52,785
Why'd you ask me here, Mary?

24
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:54,921
Why did you come?

25
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,069
Hey.

26
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,838
I thought you'd left.

27
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,073
I did.

28
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,808
Got coffee.

29
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:20,777
I didn't know how you took it,
so I guessed black.

30
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,915
Black is right.

31
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,657
I know I called you last night,
but I shouldn't have.

32
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:36,625
That's okay. I get it.

33
00:01:38,263 --> 00:01:40,596
Yeah, I get it, you know,

34
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:44,167
harsh light of day and all.

35
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:50,740
I just thought, I don't know,
we could hang out and talk.

36
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:56,745
I kind of get the feeling that
you need someone to talk to.

37
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:00,916
I can't.

38
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:04,319
Are you working?

39
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,922
Yep.

40
00:02:08,992 --> 00:02:11,658
Yeah, me too.

41
00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:20,001
Yeah, I kind of get the
feeling you're always working.

42
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:43,989
The good news or the bad news?

43
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:45,958
Bad news.

44
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:47,426
We're out of muffins.

45
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:49,295
Damn it.

46
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,595
The good news?

47
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:52,464
Troy Dixon was diagnosed

48
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:54,800
with depression a few months
before his death.

49
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:57,369
Based on this and the parallel
to the Ethan Grant case,

50
00:02:57,405 --> 00:03:00,371
I got approval for a wire.

51
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:02,473
I'm gonna crack
this Desmond Bennett.

52
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:05,944
Frank, Mary called me
last night.

53
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,650
Tell me you did not have sex
with this woman again.

54
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:13,929
I can get her to confess.

55
00:03:13,954 --> 00:03:17,087
Yeah? Is there truth serum
in your dick?

56
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:18,788
You're a God damn
liability, man.

57
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,790
Come on, man, she called me
because she was alone.

58
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,093
She was afraid,
and for some reason,

59
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:26,196
I don't know,
I make her feel safe.

60
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,630
I will get her to talk.

61
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,399
Do your damn job.

62
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:32,369
Get a confession.

63
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:26,619
What are you doing here?

64
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:29,922
I love this view.

65
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:35,728
Why are you here?

66
00:04:35,763 --> 00:04:37,630
Did you know that the penalty
for dealing pento

67
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:39,565
is the most severe
in the legal system?

68
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,234
More than heroin.

69
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:45,570
When Des came and asked if
I could get him some pento,

70
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:47,539
I thought, "That's odd."

71
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:49,241
You know, it's not a drug people

72
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:51,543
often use recreationally,

73
00:04:51,578 --> 00:04:53,648
but drug choice is subjective,

74
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,814
and who am I to judge?

75
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,782
But then one day, you showed up
at my door,

76
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:01,152
and you were asking for pento.

77
00:05:01,187 --> 00:05:03,854
You, Dr. Mary Harris.

78
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:05,322
Remember yesterday,
when I told you

79
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:06,790
to leave me and my family alone?

80
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:08,459
I meant it.

81
00:05:08,494 --> 00:05:09,993
Ooh.

82
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:11,462
And what is pento used for?

83
00:05:11,497 --> 00:05:14,565
It's used for capital
punishment, euthanasia.

84
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,999
Death.

85
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:19,702
It's used for killing people.

86
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:21,071
So here's what I think.

87
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,746
I don't think Des
is using pento.

88
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:25,867
In fact, I think
he's probably sober.

89
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,710
He looks fantastic.

90
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,480
But I think you and Des
have a little side business,

91
00:05:30,515 --> 00:05:33,014
where you're sending people off
into the long good-night.

92
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,585
Grady, you really need to stop
messing with me.

93
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,852
Why?

94
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:40,850
Because it's making me
want to kill you.

95
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:50,164
I don't think I've met anyone
like you in my life, Mary.

96
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,301
I mean, you seem so straight,

97
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:55,936
this perfect little doctor

98
00:05:55,972 --> 00:06:00,174
with an nice house and
pretty little daughters,

99
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,345
but I see you, man, you are
right there on the edge.

100
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,613
Yeah, I am.

101
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:07,747
I mean, I like what you're
doing, it's good.

102
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:11,851
It's a little dark,
but I'm into it.

103
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:14,053
I want a cut.

104
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:16,089
'Cause that's the way I work.

105
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,448
So the next time you come to me
to buy pento,

106
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:21,361
you be prepared to negotiate.

107
00:06:23,431 --> 00:06:25,531
Mary.

108
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,905
<i>Hey, this is Jess.
Text me, it's faster.</i>

109
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:37,743
Hey, Jess, it's me.

110
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:39,612
You're not answering your phone.

111
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:42,847
Maybe you're still mad at me.

112
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:47,818
I just wanted to see...
make sure you're okay.

113
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:49,220
If we're okay.

114
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:51,422
Call me back, all right?

115
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,924
Love you.

116
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:43,114
Your shoes, dear.

117
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,684
You need a new pair.
You're on your feet all day.

118
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:47,909
- I know.
- Good shoes pay for themselves.

119
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:49,810
Well, my money's tied up
at the moment.

120
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,778
Annie?

121
00:07:51,814 --> 00:07:53,880
When you're done, come and
see me in the boardroom.

122
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,649
The boardroom? Why so official?

123
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:57,351
It's confidential.

124
00:07:57,386 --> 00:07:58,752
Am I getting a raise?

125
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:01,788
No.

126
00:08:57,342 --> 00:08:58,808
Hey.

127
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:00,343
It's, Detective Wesley.

128
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,612
I need you to do a local check
for me, okay?

129
00:09:02,648 --> 00:09:06,283
It's north of the city.
876 Bridgton Road.

130
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:10,754
Call me back with it, okay?

131
00:09:34,177 --> 00:09:36,577
You know you're aiming
for the can, right?

132
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:37,845
Well, then, show men.

133
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,414
You just have to be
one with the gun.

134
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:40,782
It's an extension of you.

135
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:44,752
Just... just be the gun.

136
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:50,762
Mary.

137
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:55,362
What are you doing here?

138
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:56,797
Who is this?

139
00:09:56,832 --> 00:09:57,798
Who are you?

140
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,566
Is that gun registered?

141
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:00,967
What are you, a cop?

142
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:03,113
Ben, Nicole. Nicole, Ben.

143
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,403
My sister.

144
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,496
My... stalker.

145
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:11,009
Yep, he's a cop.

146
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:13,045
Mary, Mary.

147
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,015
What have you gotten
yourself into?

148
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,132
You realize you're trespassing, right?

149
00:10:25,484 --> 00:10:26,716
Yeah, I do.

150
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:27,952
So why are you following me?

151
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:30,687
We said good-bye, decided this
was a mistake, remember?

152
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:33,424
I remember, I just...

153
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:37,592
don't really care.

154
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:40,128
What's with the gun?

155
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:43,499
It's a new hobby.

156
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:46,469
Are you in some kind of danger?

157
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:53,741
All right, listen.

158
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:56,210
The hardest thing about
shooting a weapon

159
00:10:56,245 --> 00:10:58,545
is controlling
your subconscious.

160
00:10:58,581 --> 00:11:00,881
So just relax.

161
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,283
Okay?

162
00:11:02,318 --> 00:11:05,853
Breathe.

163
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:06,903
Aim.

164
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:11,858
When you're ready,

165
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:13,893
slow and steady,

166
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:16,863
pull the trigger.

167
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:22,169
Am I making lunch
for two or three?

168
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:24,171
Three.

169
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:45,156
That's a '63 Vintage Telecaster.

170
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:47,958
You play?

171
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:50,362
Always wanted to,
but I never found the time.

172
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:53,298
Yeah, time is funny that way?

173
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:57,268
There's either too little
or way too much.

174
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:07,478
That's nice.

175
00:12:07,513 --> 00:12:09,546
What is it?

176
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:11,315
"In My Time of Dying."

177
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:19,589
So...

178
00:12:19,624 --> 00:12:23,860
You're a progressive
end-of-life counselor?

179
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:25,328
Yeah.

180
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:27,430
We like to think of ourselves
as a...

181
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:29,565
an alternative
to palliative care.

182
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:34,404
Your, your file says that
you were diagnosed

183
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:36,671
with cystic fibrosis
when you were two?

184
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:38,574
Yeah.

185
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:40,675
I was born sick.

186
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,143
Born broken.

187
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,130
Wasn't supposed to make it
this far.

188
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:47,183
You're 33, right?

189
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:49,150
You've already beat the odds.

190
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,521
You ever consider
a lung transplant?

191
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:56,291
Was at the top of the list
two months ago.

192
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:59,326
Doctor said I was too sick.

193
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,963
I wouldn't survive the surgery.

194
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,700
Yeah.

195
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:06,933
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,036
I've had a good run.

197
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:12,238
Live fast, die young, you know?

198
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:15,074
I mean, don't get me wrong, um,
I mean living's great.

199
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:20,580
I'm just ready.

200
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,520
Okay.

201
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:30,188
Okay.

202
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:32,330
I'm gonna have to talk
to my colleague.

203
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:33,722
We'll figure out a time.

204
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:39,097
We will help you.

205
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:43,068
Thanks, man.

206
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:51,408
Where is your colleague?
I thought she'd be here.

207
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:55,413
She's busy today.

208
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:57,615
Actually...,

209
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,917
we had a fight.

210
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:05,788
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,873
I'm sure she'll be here
for the main event.

212
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:15,465
You should apologize.

213
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,200
Take it from a dying man.

214
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:21,637
Sometimes friends are the only
things that keep you going.

215
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,677
Thanks.

216
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:55,503
In all my years
working in hospitals,

217
00:14:55,537 --> 00:14:57,470
I've never had to deal
with like this.

218
00:14:57,506 --> 00:14:59,439
Excuse my language.

219
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:00,808
What's going on?

220
00:15:00,843 --> 00:15:02,718
We need to talk about
Sid Thomas-Haye,

221
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:05,245
the patient who disappeared
yesterday.

222
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:06,780
I don't know anything
about that.

223
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:09,083
Well, we're working alongside
the police, who are idiots,

224
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,849
doing an internal investigation.

225
00:15:10,884 --> 00:15:13,552
So I'm gonna ask you
a few questions.

226
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:16,089
Sure. Ask away.

227
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:20,560
Sid was transferred from
the ER to ICU, correct?

228
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:23,162
Correct.

229
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:29,235
And the transfer was requested
by Dr. Mary Harris?

230
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,736
Yeah.

231
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:32,571
But his injuries
weren't life-threatening.

232
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:35,440
So why did Dr. Harris transfer
him to intensive care?

233
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,543
I don't know.

234
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:39,009
I'm a nurse.

235
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:42,847
I do what I'm told.
I take instruction.

236
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:47,385
You don't think that request
was just a little unusual?

237
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:52,223
I really couldn't say.

238
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:54,574
I barely know Dr. Harris.

239
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:02,399
<i>You've reached Dr. Mary Harris.</i>

240
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:04,467
<i>Leave a message.</i>

241
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:06,336
So I met with Morgan.

242
00:16:06,371 --> 00:16:07,903
Nice guy. Musician.

243
00:16:07,938 --> 00:16:10,373
He wants to wave the white flag.

244
00:16:10,408 --> 00:16:11,707
So he gave me his guitar,

245
00:16:11,744 --> 00:16:15,712
a Tele-something or other,
as a deposit.

246
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:18,713
Anyway, I thought I'd call,
see when you're available.

247
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:26,554
You know what I was
thinking about?

248
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,990
About how when two bucks fight...

249
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:32,026
or anything with antlers,
really...

250
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:34,695
you know, sometimes they get
their antlers locked together.

251
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,930
And they can't unlock them, and

252
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:39,600
they can't live like that,

253
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:42,269
so they both just die.

254
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:45,372
Locked together.

255
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:47,541
I don't know, point being,

256
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:50,010
if they lock antlers,

257
00:16:50,045 --> 00:16:51,877
they both go down.

258
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,743
You got me, Officer.

259
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,546
I was talking on the phone.
Old habits die hard.

260
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:31,149
Desmond Bennett.

261
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,217
Do I know you?

262
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,085
I'm Detective Frank Gaines.

263
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,755
Is there a problem,
Detective Frank Gaines?

264
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,835
I'm going to need you to come
with me to the station.

265
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,425
For talking on the phone?

266
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:42,760
Please, step out of the car.

267
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:45,662
Come on. Let's go.

268
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,164
No, thanks.

269
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,968
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to insist on it.

270
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,169
What's going on?

271
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,537
I'll explain on the way.

272
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,605
Am I under arrest?

273
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,850
If it'd make it easier for you,

274
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:59,308
I can do that.

275
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:03,687
No.

276
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:05,614
No, this is bullshit.
This is harassment.

277
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:06,927
I'm not going anywhere with you.

278
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:09,352
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

279
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:11,253
Tried to do this the nice way,
but,

280
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:14,723
we can do it the hard way.

281
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,566
Here you go, mate.

282
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,705
It's fabulous.

283
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,408
Gourmet.

284
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:34,677
You a football fan?

285
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:37,279
And I don't mean that English
"Footy" bullshit.

286
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:39,682
I mean pigskin, cheerleader,

287
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:42,017
pompon football.

288
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:45,287
Troy Dixon football.

289
00:18:45,322 --> 00:18:48,823
Yeah, yeah, we know about Troy.

290
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:50,792
Listen, look, I understand.

291
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:52,137
You want to help people,
you know,

292
00:18:52,161 --> 00:18:53,828
end their pain and suffering.

293
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:56,330
I went through it
with my grandpappy.

294
00:18:56,366 --> 00:18:59,100
Yeah his death dragged
on and on.

295
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:00,968
I remember thinking, "I wish..."

296
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:02,169
"I wish there was something,

297
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:03,904
someone to help him."

298
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:08,876
I am so sorry for your loss.

299
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:14,080
Come on, Des.

300
00:19:14,116 --> 00:19:15,849
You and Mary, your business.

301
00:19:15,885 --> 00:19:17,584
Mary and I sometimes volunteer

302
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,719
with people that are dying.

303
00:19:19,754 --> 00:19:22,121
We talk to them. That's all.

304
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:23,890
Like how you talked
to my friend Joel?

305
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:27,794
Is conversation against the law?

306
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:33,065
You know, Mary was with
my partner last night.

307
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,435
Yeah, yeah, she called him all
messed up about something.

308
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,769
Just think you should know,
because

309
00:19:37,805 --> 00:19:41,673
I think you should know
the truth, Des.

310
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:49,514
My partner, Ben...
that's his real name...

311
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,950
he's one of the best
UC guys out there.

312
00:19:51,985 --> 00:19:53,984
He can crack anyone.

313
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:57,755
By sleeping with them.

314
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,857
If it helps, yeah.

315
00:19:59,892 --> 00:20:01,859
Yeah.

316
00:20:01,894 --> 00:20:03,994
Look, I'm saying,
how do you know that Mary

317
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:08,466
isn't bearing her pretty little
soul to him right now?

318
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,870
You should talk to me.

319
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:16,377
I'm only trying to help you.

320
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,046
Okay.

321
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:27,583
Okay, I have a question.

322
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:30,352
Shoot.

323
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:33,321
Do you even need
a high school education

324
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,332
to be a cop, or do they let
just anybody join?

325
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,090
Gonna be telling jokes
when you're on trial for murder?

326
00:20:44,115 --> 00:20:47,368
Well, I mean, trials could
use more humor, right?

327
00:20:48,938 --> 00:20:51,839
I'd like a lawyer.

328
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,745
Mary, what's going on?

329
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,547
You only show up here
when something's wrong.

330
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:00,915
That's not true.

331
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,360
You want to learn
how to shoot a gun.

332
00:21:02,384 --> 00:21:04,283
You have a cop following you?

333
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,853
Tell me.

334
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:08,321
There's nothing to tell.

335
00:21:08,356 --> 00:21:10,721
Bitch, please.
I know when you're lying.

336
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:13,292
You taught me how to lie,
remember?

337
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,400
Okay, but you have to promise
to stay cool, all right?

338
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:24,069
I was born cool.

339
00:21:24,104 --> 00:21:26,304
You were there.

340
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,255
I started providing
a service for people.

341
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,910
People who want to die.

342
00:21:30,945 --> 00:21:33,178
And I help them.

343
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:35,880
I'm sorry, what?

344
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:40,217
I kill people.

345
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:41,519
How?

346
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:43,521
There's a drug. It's fatal.

347
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:45,149
- Mary...
- I know.

348
00:21:45,174 --> 00:21:47,792
I know.

349
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:49,761
But these people need me, okay?

350
00:21:49,796 --> 00:21:52,629
No one else will help them.

351
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:56,099
I'm a doctor, and it's medicine.

352
00:21:58,537 --> 00:22:01,337
Is he investigating you?

353
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:03,339
Yeah.

354
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,809
My God.

355
00:22:05,844 --> 00:22:07,544
This is bad.

356
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,112
I mean, you could go to jail.
What about Jess and Cambie?

357
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:12,387
Nicole, you said
you would stay cool.

358
00:22:13,618 --> 00:22:15,585
What are you gonna do?

359
00:22:26,163 --> 00:22:28,979
I was thinking maybe
we could go for a walk.

360
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:32,968
Yeah. Sounds good.

361
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:41,275
Okay, turn it.

362
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,884
I'm gonna kill myself
from boredom.

363
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:46,589
Okay, we need to plan an escape.

364
00:22:46,628 --> 00:22:49,083
Dad, can we go to the beach,
please?

365
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,818
Beach?

366
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:52,419
What are you talking about?

367
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,454
You're learning fundamental
skills here.

368
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,624
Yes, measure twice, cut once.

369
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,191
I really have it for life.

370
00:22:58,227 --> 00:23:00,060
I promise.

371
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,561
That's not reno-attire.

372
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:04,163
- I know.
- I got called into work.

373
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:05,865
My God, this is so unfair.

374
00:23:05,892 --> 00:23:08,361
You guys are making us
be child slaves

375
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:10,302
on this beautiful summer day.

376
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:14,007
All right, we are young,
and we are restless.

377
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:15,665
- And dramatic.
- Yeah.

378
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:17,143
No kidding.

379
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:19,811
Look, we're pretty much done
here, so, um,

380
00:23:19,847 --> 00:23:23,115
can, you drop the girls
off at the beach?

381
00:23:25,786 --> 00:23:27,318
Yes.

382
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:29,287
Let's go.

383
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,992
So that's the house you
and your sister grew up in?

384
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:36,293
Yeah.

385
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:38,863
With your parents?

386
00:23:38,898 --> 00:23:41,565
Didn't I tell you
we were raised by wolves?

387
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,269
So that's why you're so guarded.

388
00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:48,372
We lived there with my mother.

389
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:51,142
She passed away when I was 16.

390
00:23:51,177 --> 00:23:52,909
Cancer.

391
00:23:52,944 --> 00:23:56,112
And Dad left long before.

392
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:57,781
How about your parents?

393
00:23:57,816 --> 00:24:00,316
Janet and Gil Wesley,

394
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:02,986
they are retired,
and they live in Florida.

395
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:04,988
You ever been to Florida?

396
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:07,991
No. No.

397
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:11,660
Maybe we could go someday.

398
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:15,263
Can I ask you something?

399
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:16,999
Yeah, why not?

400
00:24:17,034 --> 00:24:19,612
How many people have you helped?

401
00:24:21,772 --> 00:24:23,172
I don't know what you mean.

402
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:24,284
Okay, let me put it this way:

403
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:25,907
How many people have you killed?

404
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:29,510
How many people have you killed?

405
00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:31,312
Two.

406
00:24:31,347 --> 00:24:33,547
Two's a lot.

407
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,548
Self-defense?

408
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:35,584
Yeah.

409
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:39,918
One of them wasn't, though.

410
00:24:41,891 --> 00:24:44,157
This undercover operation,

411
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:45,759
I got pretty close
to this suspect,

412
00:24:45,794 --> 00:24:47,560
I got close to his family,

413
00:24:47,596 --> 00:24:51,765
and then he killed himself.

414
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,667
Why do you count that?

415
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,336
Because I became his friend,

416
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:58,004
and then I sent him to jail,

417
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,072
and that's where it happened.

418
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:02,674
Many ways to kill a man.

419
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,977
You didn't kill him.

420
00:25:05,012 --> 00:25:07,780
You couldn't save him either.

421
00:25:07,815 --> 00:25:09,481
It was his choice.

422
00:25:10,517 --> 00:25:12,024
Ethan Grant?

423
00:25:14,856 --> 00:25:16,720
Did he have a choice?

424
00:25:18,358 --> 00:25:20,191
I don't know who that is.

425
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,054
Well, Ethan Grant is the son
of Lucas Grant.

426
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,729
Judge Lucas Grant.

427
00:25:24,765 --> 00:25:27,799
And he believes
his son was murdered.

428
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:32,237
You know, Ethan,
he had this journal.

429
00:25:32,272 --> 00:25:35,005
I mean, he didn't name names,
but he wrote about

430
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,241
this doctor and this nurse
who were helping him out,

431
00:25:37,276 --> 00:25:40,043
and that's why
I went undercover.

432
00:25:41,113 --> 00:25:43,247
The thing is, Mary, I mean,

433
00:25:43,282 --> 00:25:45,916
there's no case,
'cause you're smart.

434
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:47,517
You're good.

435
00:25:47,552 --> 00:25:49,019
But then,

436
00:25:49,054 --> 00:25:52,088
we came across Troy Dixon.

437
00:25:52,123 --> 00:25:54,290
And then this all got very real.

438
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:55,892
You shouldn't be
telling me this.

439
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:58,127
No, I shouldn't.
I shouldn't be telling you this,

440
00:25:58,163 --> 00:25:59,862
I shouldn't have seen you
last night,

441
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:04,000
I shouldn't be here right now.

442
00:26:04,035 --> 00:26:05,334
Well, maybe you're here because

443
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:08,436
you don't think
there should be a case.

444
00:26:10,908 --> 00:26:13,008
I'll let you get that.

445
00:26:19,783 --> 00:26:21,149
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey.</i>

446
00:26:21,185 --> 00:26:24,652
Did a search for you on that
address, 876 Bridgton Road?

447
00:26:24,688 --> 00:26:26,954
Yeah, all right, thanks.
I already know who lives there.

448
00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:28,689
<i>Yeah? Nicole Mitchell?</i>

449
00:26:28,724 --> 00:26:31,325
Mitchell, not... not Harris?

450
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,795
No, definitely Mitchell.

451
00:26:34,831 --> 00:26:37,131
Okay, can you do a search
for any records

452
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:38,933
on Mary Mitchell?

453
00:26:38,968 --> 00:26:41,001
<i>Sure thing.
I'll call if I find anything.</i>

454
00:26:41,037 --> 00:26:43,569
- Yeah, is... is Frank around?
- He has your boy

455
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:45,771
Desmond Bennett in
the interrogation room.

456
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:47,240
Okay, all right, um,

457
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:51,477
get him to give me a call
when he's out, okay?

458
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:54,113
I know all about you, Des.

459
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:56,115
Big shot plastic surgeon,

460
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:57,317
lost your license because

461
00:26:57,352 --> 00:26:58,884
you were operating
while you were high.

462
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,518
I mean...

463
00:27:00,554 --> 00:27:04,289
It's hilarious, I mean, that's...
That's pretty funny, right?

464
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:06,258
- Yeah, yeah.
- You make a living putting

465
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,499
double-D's in 20-year-olds,

466
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:09,166
and you can't even
get that right.

467
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:10,137
Ha!

468
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,630
I mean, come on.

469
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:15,467
But here's the thing.
Here's the thing.

470
00:27:15,502 --> 00:27:18,502
Mary, I believe
she wants to help people.

471
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:20,872
I do, I do, but you?

472
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:23,241
Nah. Not that deep.

473
00:27:23,276 --> 00:27:26,480
You lost your job, and you found
out what Mary was doing,

474
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:28,473
and you saw an opportunity.

475
00:27:28,498 --> 00:27:30,292
I mean, that's all these people
are to you.

476
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,293
A steady stream of income.

477
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,748
How pathetic.

478
00:27:33,773 --> 00:27:35,451
Wow. Staggering.

479
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:40,190
You... you have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

480
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,192
So... so you care?

481
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,727
You're God damn
right that I care.

482
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,630
You know, these people are...
Are in pain.

483
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:51,166
And suffering. And scared.

484
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,348
They're going through something
that most people

485
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:55,371
are too afraid to even mention,
much less face.

486
00:27:55,396 --> 00:27:57,544
They... they need someone that...

487
00:27:57,569 --> 00:27:58,908
that they can talk to!

488
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,576
They need someone...

489
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:03,913
Yeah? What do they need?

490
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,680
Help.

491
00:28:05,716 --> 00:28:08,616
And you help them,
don't you, Des?

492
00:28:08,651 --> 00:28:12,353
You help them.

493
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:14,155
Gentlemen.

494
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,958
This interrogation is over.

495
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:22,479
So, on what grounds are
you holding Mr. Bennett.

496
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:25,108
Nice shoes.

497
00:28:25,144 --> 00:28:26,476
Yes, they are.

498
00:28:26,512 --> 00:28:28,078
Too bad they don't come
in your size.

499
00:28:28,113 --> 00:28:29,779
I like you.

500
00:28:29,814 --> 00:28:31,348
- Don't talk.
- Okay.

501
00:28:31,383 --> 00:28:32,927
No, unless you want to charge
Mr. Bennett,

502
00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:34,729
and I don't think you do,
because then I would have to

503
00:28:34,753 --> 00:28:36,119
go into the whole SIU
investigation

504
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:37,720
into your conduct last year.

505
00:28:37,756 --> 00:28:40,456
That kid who almost died
in your custody?

506
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:44,460
You didn't have grounds
to hold him either, did you?

507
00:28:44,495 --> 00:28:45,994
Or you can do whatever you like,

508
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:49,432
and I'll apply for
a habeas corpus.

509
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:51,434
Fine.

510
00:28:51,469 --> 00:28:53,869
But before you start filling his
head with crazy ideas,

511
00:28:53,904 --> 00:28:55,904
I have an offer.

512
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,107
Your client is a primary suspect
in a murder investigation.

513
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:01,008
He doesn't have to be
if he cooperates.

514
00:29:01,044 --> 00:29:03,111
- Define "Cooperate."
- He wears a wire.

515
00:29:03,146 --> 00:29:04,912
Gathers evidence
against his partner.

516
00:29:04,948 --> 00:29:07,549
We offer him immunity.
Offer dies at midnight.

517
00:29:08,952 --> 00:29:10,751
We will get back to you.

518
00:29:10,787 --> 00:29:13,154
Do.

519
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,888
Door?

520
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:16,590
Mr. Bennett?

521
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,258
Of course.

522
00:29:18,294 --> 00:29:20,894
I'll just... leave.

523
00:29:43,651 --> 00:29:45,218
- Ladies.
- Hey.

524
00:29:45,253 --> 00:29:47,153
I didn't know you'd
be here, Tristan.

525
00:29:47,188 --> 00:29:49,053
Yeah. Naomi texted me.

526
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:50,288
Jeez!

527
00:29:50,324 --> 00:29:53,758
Said you guys needed to escape
from reno-jail?

528
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:58,396
So, your mom

529
00:29:58,432 --> 00:30:00,332
is dating your dad, right?

530
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:02,867
Yeah, they're all
in love and shit.

531
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:05,869
So you guys are pretty much
sisters now?

532
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:09,106
We... we're not like
sisters, no.

533
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:13,054
Hey, look, this is that stuff
I was telling you about.

534
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,979
- Let me see it.
- What are you doing with that?

535
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:17,881
It's okay... I took too much
the first time.

536
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,495
Yeah, yeah, you ended up
in the hospital.

537
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,084
I looked it up, okay?

538
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,420
And apparently,
if you only take a little bit,

539
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,356
there's a euphoria.

540
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,793
My... what the hell, Jess?
What is your problem?

541
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:33,062
You have a death wish.

542
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:36,266
I'm over it, okay?
I'm so over it!

543
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:43,539
You good?

544
00:30:43,574 --> 00:30:45,507
Are you cool?

545
00:30:49,513 --> 00:30:51,480
Thank you.

546
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,384
So.

547
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:58,619
You're the best criminal lawyer
in the city.

548
00:30:58,655 --> 00:31:01,055
Yeah, some people think so.

549
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,456
- Why?
- Well, because

550
00:31:02,492 --> 00:31:04,858
that's what I told Richard
I wanted.

551
00:31:04,894 --> 00:31:06,827
Yes, he told me that
he represented you

552
00:31:06,862 --> 00:31:08,362
in your malpractice suit.

553
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:10,798
Which I lost.

554
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:12,733
And now, you're being
investigated for murder.

555
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:15,735
I'm having a very
litigious year.

556
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:18,638
You know, this is such
bullshit, you know?

557
00:31:18,674 --> 00:31:20,318
They should be focusing
on real murderers...

558
00:31:20,342 --> 00:31:22,375
I'm gonna stop you right there.

559
00:31:22,411 --> 00:31:25,245
I only want to know
what I need to know.

560
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,580
I'm gonna ask you
some questions,

561
00:31:26,615 --> 00:31:28,015
and I'm gonna give you
some options.

562
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:29,716
All right?

563
00:31:31,018 --> 00:31:32,184
So the cops are investigating

564
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,854
you and your partner for murder.

565
00:31:35,889 --> 00:31:37,456
Assisted suicide.

566
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:39,725
That depends on
how you look at it.

567
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,194
Now, hypothetically speaking,

568
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,863
if there was any validity
to their claims,

569
00:31:44,898 --> 00:31:49,267
and you were out there
helping people die,

570
00:31:49,302 --> 00:31:51,902
you're doing this what, out of
the goodness of your heart?

571
00:31:51,938 --> 00:31:54,272
That, and a...

572
00:31:54,307 --> 00:31:57,842
one-time fee of $10,000.

573
00:31:57,877 --> 00:32:01,312
That complicates things.

574
00:32:01,348 --> 00:32:03,180
Are these people terminally ill?

575
00:32:03,216 --> 00:32:04,648
Yeah.

576
00:32:04,683 --> 00:32:06,383
Well, a few could be debated,

577
00:32:06,418 --> 00:32:10,120
which is the nature
of the problem.

578
00:32:10,155 --> 00:32:13,957
Which brings us back
to our immunity offer.

579
00:32:13,992 --> 00:32:17,427
Would you consider wearing a
wire on your partner?

580
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:21,464
I don't think I could do that.

581
00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:23,716
Do you think your partner
would say the same?

582
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:29,938
In my experience,
an offer like this

583
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:31,615
goes to the most willing party.

584
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:35,944
So, you have until midnight

585
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,274
to decide whether that's
going to be you

586
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:39,807
or him.

587
00:32:46,055 --> 00:32:48,388
So, how was your walk?

588
00:32:50,994 --> 00:32:52,888
Wow, it was that good?

589
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:56,363
What do you do, Nicole?

590
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,699
I make people beautiful.

591
00:32:58,734 --> 00:33:00,301
Hair, esthetics.

592
00:33:00,336 --> 00:33:02,836
I have a salon in the house,
pays the bills.

593
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:05,406
Kind of.

594
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,008
So how did you two meet, anyway?

595
00:33:08,043 --> 00:33:09,677
It's a long story.

596
00:33:09,712 --> 00:33:11,077
I have time.

597
00:33:11,113 --> 00:33:15,548
Well, your sister was
actually my doctor.

598
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:19,118
A doctor-patient relationship?

599
00:33:19,153 --> 00:33:20,920
That's very unethical.

600
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:24,390
- Yeah, it is.
- Very unethical.

601
00:33:24,426 --> 00:33:27,092
What was wrong with you, Ben?

602
00:33:27,128 --> 00:33:29,961
I had cancer.

603
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:33,264
You had cancer?

604
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,267
And it was really bad.
I thought he was gonna die.

605
00:33:36,303 --> 00:33:38,903
It was awful.

606
00:33:41,975 --> 00:33:43,431
Then he got better.

607
00:33:44,678 --> 00:33:45,782
Yeah.

608
00:33:47,532 --> 00:33:49,532
And then you fell in love.

609
00:33:55,655 --> 00:33:57,421
I got to take this.

610
00:33:57,457 --> 00:34:00,891
Excuse me.

611
00:34:00,926 --> 00:34:03,360
Just one second.

612
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:09,131
<i>Mary Mitchell,
now known as Mary Harris.</i>

613
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:11,033
<i>She changed her name at 18.</i>

614
00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:13,470
Was investigated for
the murder of her mother.

615
00:34:13,505 --> 00:34:15,271
No, her mother died of cancer.

616
00:34:15,306 --> 00:34:17,874
Ben, her mother was found
dead in Chalk Lake

617
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,598
with her hands tied together.

618
00:34:25,483 --> 00:34:28,183
He likes you, and you like him.

619
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:30,252
And you, like, really like him.

620
00:34:30,287 --> 00:34:31,405
He's okay.

621
00:34:32,055 --> 00:34:33,983
I think you should
tell him the truth.

622
00:34:36,394 --> 00:34:38,192
- Why?
- Because he cares about you,

623
00:34:38,227 --> 00:34:40,361
and maybe he can help.

624
00:34:40,397 --> 00:34:42,196
Just tell him what you told me,

625
00:34:42,231 --> 00:34:44,399
that you're a doctor,
and it's medicine.

626
00:34:44,434 --> 00:34:46,701
That I get illegally
from a drug dealer,

627
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:48,436
who's now threatening me.

628
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:51,506
Yeah, all the more reason
to turn yourself in.

629
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:53,686
Look, I know you think that
you can control everything,

630
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,842
but you cannot control this.

631
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:59,279
And murder investigations,
they don't go away easily.

632
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:00,874
You know this.

633
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:06,953
<i>There's a transcript.</i>

634
00:35:06,988 --> 00:35:10,390
Okay. Read it.

635
00:35:10,426 --> 00:35:13,893
"When did you
notice your mother was missing?"

636
00:35:13,928 --> 00:35:15,795
"In the morning."

637
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,195
"What did you think happened?"

638
00:35:17,231 --> 00:35:18,864
"She killed herself."

639
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,300
"But she was found
with her hands tied together.

640
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:22,835
How could she have done that?"

641
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,837
<i>"Can I please go?"</i>

642
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,942
<i>"Did you tie her hands
behind her back?"</i>

643
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:27,967
<i>"No."</i>

644
00:35:28,642 --> 00:35:31,643
"So you're saying she tied
her own hands?"

645
00:35:31,678 --> 00:35:33,812
"I tried to save her."

646
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:35,613
<i>Goes on and on.</i>

647
00:35:35,649 --> 00:35:38,883
Okay, but, there wasn't enough?

648
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:40,051
Not enough to charge her.

649
00:35:40,086 --> 00:35:41,920
But enough for her
to change her name.

650
00:35:41,955 --> 00:35:43,922
Ben, you don't know
who this woman is.

651
00:35:43,957 --> 00:35:45,423
<i>She's been involved in the death</i>

652
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,691
<i>of God knows how many people.</i>

653
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:49,493
<i>She... she preys on people.</i>

654
00:35:49,528 --> 00:35:51,762
<i>She's been doing this
since she was 16.</i>

655
00:35:51,797 --> 00:35:54,998
<i>Okay, she's lying to you.
She is manipulating you.</i>

656
00:35:56,704 --> 00:35:58,180
I'll call you back.

657
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:02,712
I have to talk to you.

658
00:36:02,775 --> 00:36:04,189
Yeah, you do.

659
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:09,111
I want to be honest with you.

660
00:36:09,146 --> 00:36:11,481
Good. Hold on.

661
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:14,383
What are you doing?

662
00:36:16,454 --> 00:36:18,588
Mary Mitchell?

663
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:22,156
Your mother didn't die
of cancer, did she?

664
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:26,227
Why'd you lie?

665
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:27,829
Because it's easier.

666
00:36:27,865 --> 00:36:31,366
Easier than what, telling
people that you killed her?

667
00:36:31,401 --> 00:36:32,579
Come on, Mary.
You want to be honest?

668
00:36:32,603 --> 00:36:34,836
Let's be honest. Be honest.
Come on.

669
00:36:34,872 --> 00:36:37,170
You think you get it,
but you don't.

670
00:36:37,206 --> 00:36:39,306
Okay.

671
00:36:39,341 --> 00:36:41,384
So explain it to me.

672
00:36:43,813 --> 00:36:45,779
I think you should go now.

673
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:50,784
Know what's funny, Mary?

674
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,620
I really thought I knew you.

675
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:54,353
You do know me, Ben.

676
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:55,399
No.

677
00:36:58,876 --> 00:37:00,313
Who are you?

678
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:06,666
I'm Mary Harris.

679
00:37:06,701 --> 00:37:08,367
I'm an ER doctor.

680
00:37:08,403 --> 00:37:10,936
And I work at Eden
General Hospital.

681
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:31,912
<i>You know sometimes they get
their antlers locked together.</i>

682
00:37:31,952 --> 00:37:35,721
<i>And they can't unlock them,
and they can't live like that,</i>

683
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:37,889
<i>so they both just die.</i>

684
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:40,157
<i>Locked together.</i>

685
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:42,593
<i>I don't know, point being,</i>

686
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:44,862
<i>if they lock antlers,</i>

687
00:37:44,897 --> 00:37:47,832
<i>they both go down.</i>

688
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:13,222
You can get that.

689
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,727
It's okay.

690
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:19,806
So you want heroin.

691
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,492
Yeah, you have
a problem with that?

692
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:25,267
No, I only have a problem if
you're setting me up.

693
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,703
I'm not setting you up, Grady.

694
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:31,039
I'm trying to get high.

695
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:35,609
Is this about my conversation
with Mary?

696
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:36,844
You talked to Mary?

697
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,213
I did. This morning.

698
00:38:39,248 --> 00:38:41,215
At her house.

699
00:38:42,752 --> 00:38:44,559
I know about your business,
yeah.

700
00:38:47,023 --> 00:38:48,918
It's okay, Des.

701
00:38:50,325 --> 00:38:53,122
Although, I am unhappy
that you lied to me.

702
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:57,630
I think this might be
a really good thing for me.

703
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:59,465
Like it was meant to be.

704
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:01,702
I lose Sid,

705
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:02,813
and then,

706
00:39:04,306 --> 00:39:06,125
I meet Mary, so...

707
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:08,473
Bit fortuitous,
wouldn't you say?

708
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:11,510
Yeah, yeah, well,
I'm done with Mary.

709
00:39:11,545 --> 00:39:13,825
Done with all of it.
I'm finished.

710
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,099
Does she know that?

711
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:22,645
I'm not like her.

712
00:39:23,957 --> 00:39:27,223
She's trying to help people,
fight the good fight.

713
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:36,760
I'm just a junkie
looking for a fix.

714
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:10,366
<i>You've reached Louise Malick,
attorney.</i>

715
00:40:10,401 --> 00:40:13,001
I'll take the deal.

716
00:40:26,784 --> 00:40:28,250
What happened?

717
00:40:28,285 --> 00:40:31,351
He asked about Mom.
I guess he found out.

718
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,686
What did you tell him?

719
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,621
Nothing.

720
00:40:34,657 --> 00:40:35,923
God.

721
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:38,725
Some things never die.

722
00:40:38,761 --> 00:40:41,862
It'll die when we die.

723
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,998
We killed her, and now he knows.

724
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:46,733
No, we saved her, and you're
still saving people.

725
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:50,036
I didn't tell you everything.
I charged them.

726
00:40:51,807 --> 00:40:53,572
- How much?
- $10,000.

727
00:40:53,608 --> 00:40:56,542
Jesus!

728
00:40:58,744 --> 00:41:00,650
People pay?

729
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:05,951
You know, I don't think
I'm a very good person.

730
00:41:05,986 --> 00:41:07,419
Why, because you
provide a service,

731
00:41:07,454 --> 00:41:08,586
and people pay for it?

732
00:41:08,622 --> 00:41:09,928
Because I like it.

733
00:41:13,016 --> 00:41:17,395
It's hard to explain,
but there's something about it.

734
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:19,164
Being with them
in their last moments,

735
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,366
when everything matters
and doesn't matter.

736
00:41:22,401 --> 00:41:24,168
Mary, you need to stop.

737
00:41:24,204 --> 00:41:26,116
I don't want to stop.

738
00:41:27,907 --> 00:41:29,974
I think there's something
wrong with me.

739
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:33,410
Well, I mean, yeah. Obviously.

740
00:41:33,446 --> 00:41:35,913
Maybe there's something wrong
with all of us.

741
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:39,015
Am I crazy like Mom?

742
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:40,583
No.

743
00:41:40,618 --> 00:41:43,553
You are nothing like her.

744
00:41:52,197 --> 00:41:53,964
What the hell, Nicole?

745
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:58,033
I was just seeing if you still
had the will to live.

746
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:05,640
You do.

747
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,693
Watch the 2 hour Finale
Event of Mary Kills People.

748
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:27,617
Next Wednesday on Global.

749
00:42:27,757 --> 00:42:29,545
Well look who it is.

750
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,580
The angel of death.

751
00:42:31,781 --> 00:42:33,081

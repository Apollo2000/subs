1
00:00:07,343 --> 00:00:11,675
I, Troy Dixon, choose to take my life.

2
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:17,542
Peace.

3
00:00:35,343 --> 00:00:37,843
Pentobarbital with champagne.

4
00:01:05,376 --> 00:01:07,609
Such a mind trip.

5
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:19,042
Troy, if you're not ready, we
don't have to do this today.

6
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:21,143
Yeah, we do.

7
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:30,075
You know, when I was a kid,
I was terrified of flying,

8
00:01:30,076 --> 00:01:33,375
and when I was 14, my mom sent
me and my sister to Portland

9
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:36,442
to visit my aunt, and
I did not want to go.

10
00:01:36,443 --> 00:01:39,908
But then we were in the
air, and it was perfect.

11
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,875
We're afraid because we
don't know what to expect.

12
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:45,642
No one's been able to come back and say,

13
00:01:45,643 --> 00:01:47,542
"There's gonna be light,
there's gonna be angels,

14
00:01:47,543 --> 00:01:51,575
you're gonna love it."

15
00:01:51,576 --> 00:01:54,642
But just because there's uncertainty

16
00:01:54,643 --> 00:01:56,576
doesn't mean there's anything to fear.

17
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:09,743
I'm ready.

18
00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:39,442
How long does it take?

19
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:43,242
It's usually very quick.

20
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:27,142
Gone.

21
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:29,075
Leaving on a jet plane?

22
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,942
Got anything better?

23
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,675
I'm home.

24
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:36,109
Honey, I'll be right up.

25
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,976
She's not supposed to be home.

26
00:04:01,543 --> 00:04:02,675
You got the money, right?

27
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,175
Are you kidding me?

28
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:05,608
You're supposed to
take care of the money.

29
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:06,942
You're supposed to be taking
care of it; Got get it.

30
00:04:06,943 --> 00:04:08,509
- Stay here.
- Go get get. Go. Go. Go.

31
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:14,142
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

32
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,608
Do it.

33
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:57,943
I'm sorry.

34
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:03,442
Come on. Hurry up.

35
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:11,175
Baby, I got you a smoothie.

36
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:27,342
Honey?

37
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:31,742
You all right?

38
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:33,776
Troy?

39
00:05:37,976 --> 00:05:39,143
Come on. Come on.

40
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:55,208
Okay. Now what?

41
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:58,075
We jump.

42
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:25,578
Give me your hand.

43
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:27,344
You feel that?

44
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,244
It's called a pulse,
and when you feel that,

45
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:30,278
it means someone's alive.

46
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,578
The guy was dead. He was gone.

47
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:33,744
Nothing like this can
ever happen again, Des.

48
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:37,044
We're supposed to be ending
suffering, not creating it.

49
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:38,578
"Do no harm", remember?

50
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:40,544
No, it was never really a
guiding principle for those

51
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:43,978
of us in plastic surgery.

52
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,478
Hola, welcome to Diego's Tacos.

53
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,411
Two orders of cheese rolls,

54
00:06:49,412 --> 00:06:52,778
three beef chalupas,
two fiesta potatoes,

55
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,344
and three root beers, please.

56
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:57,911
Four, and a steak quesadilla, por favor.

57
00:06:57,912 --> 00:06:59,911
That'll be $24.15.

58
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:01,212
Gracias.

59
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:06,111
What went wrong?

60
00:07:06,112 --> 00:07:09,044
He was a big guy, a
former football player.

61
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:10,811
I guess the dose didn't keep him dead.

62
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:12,211
Drinks are the problem.

63
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:15,844
The drinks have worked
every other time flawlessly.

64
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:18,078
If we'd done an injection,
Troy would never have come back

65
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,278
from the dead, and you
know it, and I know it,

66
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,844
straight into the bloodstream flush.

67
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:22,911
We've been through this.
It has to be their doing.

68
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:25,078
Look, I know you've got
your issues with injections,

69
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,911
so I'm volunteering to do them.

70
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:29,378
I... want to.

71
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:31,978
You know, sometimes I don't if you're a

72
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,244
compassionate doctor or a serial killer.

73
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,944
Says the woman who just
smothered a guy with a pillow.

74
00:07:36,945 --> 00:07:38,911
- Des, please.
- It's all right.

75
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:40,578
You did what you had to
do under the circumstances.

76
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:42,378
All I'm saying is, there
wouldn't have been a

77
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,644
circumstance if we'd done an injection.

78
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:47,911
Prove you can take a pulse,
then we'll talk injection.

79
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:50,378
Control freak.

80
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,778
Serial killer.

81
00:07:54,445 --> 00:07:57,544
There you go.

82
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:59,978
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

83
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,278
So...

84
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,911
who's our next hit?

85
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:06,878
We're not hit men. We're doctors.

86
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:15,978
Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary.

87
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,678
I believe in Bloody Mary.

88
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,111
Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary...

89
00:08:21,112 --> 00:08:23,211
Whoa.

90
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:24,911
What are you doing?

91
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:26,678
Bloody Mary. You chant her name, and...

92
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:28,344
You see her ghost in the mirror.

93
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:30,978
Jess, why do you have to
scare your sister like that?

94
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:34,678
- I wasn't scared.
- But she wasn't scared, see?

95
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,078
Ghosts aren't real, right?

96
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:37,478
Of course not. Come on.

97
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,512
Downstairs. I got takeout.

98
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:44,311
I love Diego's.

99
00:08:44,312 --> 00:08:46,444
So does Casper. Nom, nom, nom.

100
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:49,011
Mom, Diego's again?

101
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:51,178
A week ago, you loved it.

102
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:55,678
If ghosts aren't real, what
happens to people when they die?

103
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,644
They stay in our hearts.

104
00:08:58,645 --> 00:09:01,211
What about the people in the hospital?

105
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:02,711
What do you mean?

106
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:06,344
Well, sometimes you can't
save their lives, and they die.

107
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,878
Yeah, it happens.

108
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,159
You keep them all in your heart?

109
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:13,744
Yeah, I do.

110
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:16,478
- Daddy!
- Cambie.

111
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,478
There's my girl.

112
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:18,578
Hi.

113
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:19,778
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

114
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:20,844
You guys packed?

115
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:22,311
- Nope.
- Let's go.

116
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,411
Can you please knock next time?

117
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:27,044
Thank you for taking the girls tonight.

118
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:28,811
I forgot I had this shift.

119
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:32,711
Yeah, that's been happening a lot.

120
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:34,311
What?

121
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:36,144
Well, it's just we agreed to 50-50,

122
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:37,844
and it's been more like 80-20 lately.

123
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:40,178
It's starting to add up.

124
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,844
You want more money or...

125
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:43,344
No, it's not that I want money.

126
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:44,844
It's just...

127
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:47,078
- Maybe you should get a job.
- I can't.

128
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:48,878
I mean, I'm working on the
house, and I have the girls.

129
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,444
I have the girls. I have a job.

130
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:53,644
Mary, all I hear is
how much they miss you.

131
00:09:53,645 --> 00:09:56,078
Even when they're with you,
I mean, you come home late.

132
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:57,944
You show up with fast food.

133
00:09:57,945 --> 00:10:00,012
I don't want them to
have two absent parents.

134
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:04,178
Look, I'm doing the best
I can here, all right?

135
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:06,011
Well, so am I.

136
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:08,444
Are we going?

137
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:10,878
Yeah.

138
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,244
You know what? I've got the girls.

139
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,879
Just let me know when
you want them back.

140
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:17,444
- Bye, girls.
- Bye.

141
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:18,511
- Love you.
- Love you.

142
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:23,244
Love you too.

143
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:03,878
Murder Incorporated.

144
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,611
This is Dr. Bennett.

145
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:07,144
The seals have been tampered with.

146
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:08,811
The pento was diluted.

147
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,778
- What? You're sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

148
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:13,211
- Where are you getting it from?
- My old dealer.

149
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:14,711
And the less you know...

150
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:16,778
Des, you have one job: Get the drugs.

151
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,444
W-w-w-whoa, I'd argue I do a lot more

152
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:19,978
than just get the drugs.

153
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:21,878
I operate the camera, I file,

154
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,978
I offer the occasional
witticism if the mood is right,

155
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:26,244
sometimes when not.

156
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:28,081
Besides, every other
batch has been fine.

157
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:30,014
Well, this one isn't,
so get a new supply,

158
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,048
and make it right.

159
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:40,948
Shit.

160
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,914
I can't feel anything. Is that bad?

161
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:54,214
We're gonna take good care of you, Matt.

162
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:55,681
Don't worry. We got you.

163
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:56,981
Ready? One, two...

164
00:12:56,982 --> 00:12:59,181
Call the blood bank,
four units of O-neg stat.

165
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:00,548
Yeah, I'm not sure we're
gonna have time for that.

166
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:02,681
Matt... Matt, are you with us?

167
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:05,148
Okay, stand by.

168
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:07,314
Pericardial effusion.

169
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:08,414
The knife must have punctured his heart.

170
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:10,114
- No pulse.
- We lost him.

171
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:11,914
- Thoracotomy?
- Mary, he's gone.

172
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:13,014
Let's bring him back.

173
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:14,848
Get me a thoracotomy tray.

174
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:17,914
Call a code blue, and
get RT down here stat.

175
00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:19,848
Dr. Mary Harris feeling brave today.

176
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:21,414
Yeah, I am.

177
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:24,548
It's all yours.

178
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:25,781
You saved his life.

179
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:27,381
Well, it's why we do what we do.

180
00:13:27,382 --> 00:13:28,848
Thank you, God.

181
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,748
Well, I kind of think that
we all had a little something

182
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:32,148
to do with that today.

183
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,581
What was he doing getting
getting money out of an ATM

184
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:34,881
in that neighborhood?

185
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,248
Don't worry.

186
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,114
You can yell at him when he wakes up.

187
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:40,048
Dr. Windrom to Obstetrics.

188
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:41,314
Dr. Windrom to Obstetrics.

189
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:42,748
Don't you think it's a little early

190
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:44,281
to be patting ourselves on the back?

191
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,648
Yeah, we stabilized him...

192
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:47,181
Mary, he's good.

193
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:49,214
We're good.

194
00:13:49,215 --> 00:13:51,348
Starbucks, anybody? My treat.

195
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:52,714
Triple shot, extra hot, venti...

196
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,381
- Triple shot, venti.
- Thank you.

197
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:55,548
Mary.

198
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:56,548
Nope, thank you.

199
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:59,448
All right, nothing for Mary.

200
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:20,114
My boss is watching me like a hawk.

201
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:21,514
She watches everybody like a hawk.

202
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:23,115
It's her job.

203
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,114
She kind of looks like a hawk.

204
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,015
Beady eyes.

205
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:30,514
Two new cases.

206
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:33,048
Nora's a widow, 80, acute renal failure.

207
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:35,448
She's choosing not to do dialysis.

208
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:37,148
Her only wish now is not to suffer,

209
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:38,914
which, of course, she will.

210
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:41,514
And Joel has an inoperable brain tumor.

211
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:43,514
He's been through chemo and radiation,

212
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,014
both of which were ineffective.

213
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:47,314
Life expectancy three to four months,

214
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:49,081
but he would like to check out before...

215
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:50,781
and these are his words...

216
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:53,914
"Shit gets real," which,
of course, it will.

217
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:56,981
I gave them both your number.

218
00:14:56,982 --> 00:14:58,814
Behind every great doctor...

219
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,849
Is a better nurse.

220
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:02,481
Troy?

221
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:03,614
Yeah.

222
00:15:03,615 --> 00:15:05,181
Went well?

223
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:08,748
Yeah, peaceful.

224
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:10,149
Good.

225
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:13,948
We're doing the right thing, Annie.

226
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:18,481
No, you're doing the right thing.

227
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:21,015
I'm just making copies.

228
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:36,914
I am going to die.

229
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:40,881
I am going to die.

230
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:43,915
I'm gonna die.

231
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:52,716
_

232
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:57,614
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable.

233
00:15:57,615 --> 00:15:59,248
Please leave a message.

234
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,948
Hey, this is Joel Collins.

235
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:05,714
I... I was at Eden
General the other day.

236
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,481
I met a nurse named Annie.

237
00:16:08,482 --> 00:16:10,681
She said you could help me.

238
00:16:17,382 --> 00:16:18,981
I don't think about it.

239
00:16:18,982 --> 00:16:20,514
I think it's bam, right?

240
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:22,081
Lights out.

241
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,214
Game over.

242
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,348
- I think there's more.
- More what?

243
00:16:25,349 --> 00:16:26,714
More, something more.

244
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:28,181
I don't know, man.

245
00:16:28,182 --> 00:16:29,814
It's just a fairy tale.

246
00:16:29,815 --> 00:16:32,581
Here I am thinking you're a
good old-fashioned Catholic boy.

247
00:16:32,582 --> 00:16:37,581
No, man. I am a bad, bad Catholic boy.

248
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:40,748
Come on. Let me buy you a dance.

249
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:48,048
For my friend.

250
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:57,681
You're so sad.

251
00:16:57,682 --> 00:17:00,148
I got cancer.

252
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:01,548
Poor baby.

253
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:24,181
Did you know the Greeks
have two words for time?

254
00:17:24,182 --> 00:17:27,681
Chronos and kairos.

255
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:29,181
Greeks do love their words.

256
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:33,448
Measured time and soulful time.

257
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:35,614
Chronos is, like, tick-tock, tick-tock.

258
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:38,881
But kairos is... is the
experience, you know,

259
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:40,448
time that speeds up and slows down,

260
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:44,814
expands and collapses.

261
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:45,881
You ever experience that?

262
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:47,515
Yeah, I need more pento.

263
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:53,114
You look really good, Des.

264
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,814
I mean, you've upped your pento use,

265
00:17:54,815 --> 00:17:56,781
but yet you look distractingly vital,

266
00:17:56,782 --> 00:17:59,248
like you're glowing
or something like that.

267
00:17:59,249 --> 00:18:01,681
Doesn't it look like he's glowing?

268
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:03,614
Like a candle.

269
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:04,814
What's your point, Grady?

270
00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:08,681
Is all the pento for you?

271
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:11,248
If I look clean, it's because
you watered down your supply.

272
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:13,348
I mean, I come to you
because your product

273
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:14,648
is supposed to be pure, and instead,

274
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:16,548
you give me this low-grade,
ineffectual bullshit.

275
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:19,314
I mean, what is that?

276
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:21,014
I watered it down.

277
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:23,414
I did.

278
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:24,881
Wanted to make sure that you were using

279
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:27,381
and that you weren't selling.

280
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:28,614
'Cause you know how I
feel about that, right?

281
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:30,648
I have no interest in being a dealer.

282
00:18:33,382 --> 00:18:36,015
Okay, Sid.

283
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:39,948
You know, I might not be a
fancy doctor like you, Des,

284
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:44,848
but I help people ease
their existential pain.

285
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:47,148
You know, I deepen their experience,

286
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:50,181
elevate them to the supreme moment.

287
00:18:50,182 --> 00:18:52,049
I'm all about that kairos shit.

288
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:55,982
But here I sit public enemy number one.

289
00:19:01,282 --> 00:19:02,681
That's pure.

290
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:04,582
There's no charge.

291
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:10,281
- Thank you.
- Try it.

292
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,982
Want to make sure it
lives up to your standards.

293
00:19:19,315 --> 00:19:21,115
I trust you.

294
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:25,782
Sidney.

295
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:37,482
I hate liars.

296
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,881
- Hurry up.
- Slow down.

297
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:45,314
Nobody ever comes in here. It's okay.

298
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:47,014
Okay.

299
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:48,981
I see you've got
some prime security.

300
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:49,982
Yeah.

301
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:57,114
So I literally got an F
on my essay today, an F.

302
00:19:57,115 --> 00:19:59,114
What was it on?

303
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,948
Che Guevara. I don't know.

304
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,948
He was just some
revolutionary from Mexico.

305
00:20:04,949 --> 00:20:06,481
I think it was Cuba.

306
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:08,248
Whatever, okay?

307
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,148
Anyways, he witnessed all...

308
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:12,914
he witnessed all, like, the suffering,

309
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:15,681
and, you know, injustices of the people.

310
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:18,048
And he saved them.

311
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:21,981
Like, he saved them. He was a real hero.

312
00:20:21,982 --> 00:20:23,481
Hey, look at me.

313
00:20:23,482 --> 00:20:24,814
Hey, no, stop that.

314
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:27,681
Relax.

315
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:31,914
Do you know that you are so...

316
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:33,814
pretty?

317
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,615
Shut up.

318
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,648
Wait.

319
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,914
Do you hear that?

320
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:55,381
What is that?

321
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:58,849
Sounds like it's coming from the floor.

322
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:13,682
My God.

323
00:21:18,515 --> 00:21:21,114
Is this your mom's?

324
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:23,048
What, is she an addict or something?

325
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,481
No, she would never do drugs. I...

326
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:26,682
- Should we answer it?
- No.

327
00:21:30,382 --> 00:21:33,714
Pentobarbital.

328
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:35,414
What do you think it does?

329
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:37,148
I just think we should put it back.

330
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:38,214
Come on, Naomi, put it back.

331
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:40,481
What's the matter, darlin'?

332
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:44,548
Okay, fine. I'll put it back.

333
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:47,014
Your mom is way cooler than my mom.

334
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,181
You can have her.

335
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:53,381
My gosh, mom swap.

336
00:21:53,382 --> 00:21:58,414
So you think your mom is a...

337
00:21:58,415 --> 00:21:59,814
is a drug dealer?

338
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:01,248
She's not a drug dealer.

339
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:04,749
She's a doctor.

340
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:16,214
This is a sad place to die.

341
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:18,649
What's this guy's name again?

342
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,049
Joel.

343
00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:43,914
No, thanks. I'm off the drink.

344
00:22:43,915 --> 00:22:46,581
Yeah, you know, ever
since I got the news,

345
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:48,281
I'm like, "What the hell?"

346
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:50,981
There's a sudden removal of consequences

347
00:22:50,982 --> 00:22:54,215
when... well.

348
00:22:55,715 --> 00:22:58,814
Annie passed along your file.

349
00:22:58,815 --> 00:23:01,882
I'm sorry about your prognosis.

350
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,481
Have you told your wife?

351
00:23:06,482 --> 00:23:07,781
Girlfriend or...

352
00:23:07,782 --> 00:23:10,081
No. No, there's no women.

353
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:12,948
They hear "cancer,"
they run the other way.

354
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:18,994
So, Annie, she was a little vague,

355
00:23:18,995 --> 00:23:21,628
but she gave me your number,
said you're end-of-life

356
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:25,161
counselors and that you
had some progressive ideas.

357
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:28,428
Yes, and this is intended
to be an exploratory meeting

358
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:29,894
to find out what your needs are

359
00:23:29,895 --> 00:23:32,161
and if we might be able to help you.

360
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,761
Well, I was very clear with Annie.

361
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:37,994
I'm dying. I want to die faster.

362
00:23:37,995 --> 00:23:39,628
Is that something you can help me with?

363
00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:42,394
Yeah... yeah, if we were
in... in Switzerland,

364
00:23:42,395 --> 00:23:45,794
where assisted suicide
is legal, then absolutely.

365
00:23:45,795 --> 00:23:47,928
Unfortunately, it's not the case here.

366
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:51,428
But it doesn't mean that
we can't talk about it...

367
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,961
hypothetically.

368
00:23:52,962 --> 00:23:54,928
An option is to go to Switzerland

369
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:57,361
and be what they call a "death tourist,"

370
00:23:57,362 --> 00:23:58,961
fly there, die there.

371
00:23:58,962 --> 00:24:00,161
Yeah, I don't want to do that.

372
00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:01,961
I mean, go to Switzerland just to die.

373
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:03,494
I don't blame you, Joel.

374
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:05,161
The airfare, hotel, cost of death.

375
00:24:05,162 --> 00:24:08,328
Could run you 20 grand easy.

376
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:10,762
No, you may as well stay
home, save yourself 10 grand.

377
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:14,929
I'm good for it.

378
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:22,494
So how does it work, the dying part?

379
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:25,361
Well, in Switzerland, a
doctor would give a patient

380
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:27,994
such as yourself a lethal dose

381
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:30,261
of sodium-pentobarbital to drink.

382
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,194
There's no pain, no suffering.

383
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:34,661
You just fall asleep.

384
00:24:34,662 --> 00:24:37,828
Yeah, how come that's a
drink and not an injection?

385
00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:39,194
Because I researched it, right?

386
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:41,294
And it's... it's better.

387
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:42,628
It's a smoother exit.

388
00:24:42,629 --> 00:24:46,261
Young Joel brings up a valid point.

389
00:24:46,262 --> 00:24:48,828
Well, I think doctors feel
it's important for patients

390
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:50,862
to choose their death.

391
00:24:53,995 --> 00:24:57,194
Okay, I get it.

392
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:00,428
I've got to pull the trigger.

393
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:02,828
This is obviously a
very serious decision.

394
00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:05,228
Yeah, I know that.

395
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:10,061
And to tell you the
truth, it's... it's this,

396
00:25:10,062 --> 00:25:13,194
or I guess I could buy a gun.

397
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:15,628
Don't buy a gun.

398
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:20,162
But do take the time you
need to think about it.

399
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:26,028
Do you think he'll call?

400
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:27,928
To ask you to prom?

401
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:30,494
No, to ask me to kill him.

402
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,728
How long has it been?

403
00:25:32,729 --> 00:25:34,328
Please tell me you've had
sex since your divorce.

404
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:35,594
It's a choice.

405
00:25:35,595 --> 00:25:37,694
A sexless life is an ungodly life, Mary.

406
00:25:37,695 --> 00:25:39,494
Why do you care so much?

407
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:41,261
Well, for whom the bell tolls, you know.

408
00:25:41,262 --> 00:25:44,628
One person's death is a loss to us all.

409
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:45,994
Same principle applies to sex.

410
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:47,461
You get laid, we all get laid.

411
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,594
He's a patient, and he's dying.

412
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:50,894
Exactly. You'd be doing him a favor.

413
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:52,494
I'm sure he doesn't want
to go out with blue balls.

414
00:25:52,495 --> 00:25:53,894
It's win-win.

415
00:25:53,895 --> 00:25:56,328
Wait. Have you had sex
with any of our patients?

416
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:58,994
God no, no, no.

417
00:25:58,995 --> 00:26:02,994
Death is a big turnoff for me.
I like them young and alive.

418
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:04,861
Don't forget this.

419
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:07,328
You're sure the stuff is good?

420
00:26:07,329 --> 00:26:08,928
Well, I didn't test it,
because that would defeat the

421
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:12,794
purpose of recovery, but
yeah, it's good; I assure you.

422
00:26:12,795 --> 00:26:14,061
Yeah, how are you doing with that?

423
00:26:14,062 --> 00:26:18,494
The mundanity is
the biggest problem.

424
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:21,228
Fortunately, I still have
sex to shake things up.

425
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:24,594
So do you, Mary.

426
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:37,262
- Nice shirt.
- Thanks.

427
00:26:40,462 --> 00:26:42,761
Hi. I'm Louise. I'm Naomi's mom.

428
00:26:42,762 --> 00:26:44,061
We met at the Christmas recital.

429
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:45,061
- Yes, hi.
- Hi.

430
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,461
Nice to see you again.

431
00:26:47,462 --> 00:26:49,394
And Louise is also my...

432
00:26:49,395 --> 00:26:50,828
Daddy's girlfriend.

433
00:26:52,629 --> 00:26:54,561
Hi.

434
00:26:54,562 --> 00:26:55,594
I didn't know.

435
00:26:55,595 --> 00:26:57,061
Yeah, well, it's only been...

436
00:26:57,062 --> 00:26:58,594
A couple of months. Look, it's new.

437
00:26:58,595 --> 00:26:59,828
- Yeah.
- It was a secret.

438
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:01,828
It wasn't a secret. It was just...

439
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,361
It was just finding the right time.

440
00:27:03,362 --> 00:27:05,128
So are you sure it's
only been two months?

441
00:27:05,129 --> 00:27:07,694
'Cause you're already finishing
each other's sentences.

442
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:10,194
Shh, the show is starting.

443
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:32,928
I ran out of checks.

444
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:33,929
Thanks.

445
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:40,994
It's Jess.

446
00:27:53,895 --> 00:27:57,361
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

447
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:19,894
So what is she, a real housewife?

448
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:48,994
Mom.

449
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:50,228
My God, Naomi.

450
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,394
Go. Go.

451
00:28:52,395 --> 00:28:55,694
I'm here. What happened?

452
00:28:55,695 --> 00:28:57,428
- Call in ambulance.
- Baby.

453
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:11,494
What do we have?

454
00:29:11,495 --> 00:29:12,594
A 15-year-old female.

455
00:29:12,595 --> 00:29:14,161
Naomi, my daughter's friend.

456
00:29:14,162 --> 00:29:16,294
Collapsed onstage at
their dance recital.

457
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:22,928
What do we think?

458
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,061
Overdose.

459
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,661
Could be sedatives.

460
00:29:27,162 --> 00:29:31,594
Naomi, you're at Eden General.

461
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:33,394
Dr. Harris.

462
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:35,394
You collapsed during your performance.

463
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:36,994
Did you take anything?

464
00:29:36,995 --> 00:29:39,694
I'm gonna take this to the lab.

465
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,428
Naomi, say no to drugs.

466
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:43,328
You're too pretty to die.

467
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:46,394
Honey, what did you take?

468
00:29:46,395 --> 00:29:48,928
We're going to get the results
from your lab tests anyway,

469
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:50,761
so you might as well tell me.

470
00:29:50,762 --> 00:29:53,028
Is my mom here?

471
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,694
Probably in the waiting room right now.

472
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:57,728
- Do you want me to get her?
- No, no.

473
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,828
No, you can't tell her.

474
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:01,929
Tell her what?

475
00:30:03,162 --> 00:30:05,761
I thought it was alcohol.

476
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,428
You thought what was alcohol?

477
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:08,961
That stuff.

478
00:30:08,962 --> 00:30:11,262
That stuff that was in your shed.

479
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:19,328
Does Jess know about this?

480
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:20,761
No, she has no idea.

481
00:30:20,762 --> 00:30:24,528
I just took, like, a
tiny, tiny little bit

482
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:25,928
before going onstage, you know.

483
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:28,561
I mean, I get... I get
stage fright sometimes.

484
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:30,428
It's so stupid, and I'm sorry.

485
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:31,494
I'm never gonna do it again.

486
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:33,461
Just... just please don't tell my mom,

487
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:34,594
because she's totally gonna, like,

488
00:30:34,595 --> 00:30:36,428
send me to boarding school or something.

489
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:38,928
- I have to tell her.
- No.

490
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:41,661
No, you don't.

491
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:43,494
I mean, when I go and get birth control,

492
00:30:43,495 --> 00:30:46,128
the doctors don't tell my mom.

493
00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:48,028
That's confidentiality, right?

494
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:51,794
God, you sound like a lawyer.

495
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:53,294
Is Jess on birth control?

496
00:30:53,295 --> 00:30:54,828
No, she doesn't need it.

497
00:30:54,829 --> 00:31:00,428
Look, Dr. Harris, I don't even
know what that stuff even is,

498
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:05,161
but I do know that my mom is crazy,

499
00:31:05,162 --> 00:31:07,361
and she is a lawyer, okay?

500
00:31:07,362 --> 00:31:12,394
And if you tell her, she's
gonna be all over the both of us.

501
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:33,295
My God. You scared me half to death.

502
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:36,161
Hey, are you okay?

503
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:37,828
Yeah, I'm fine. My gosh.

504
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,461
You guys are so overdramatic.

505
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:41,094
Hey, what happened?

506
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:43,394
I fainted.

507
00:31:43,395 --> 00:31:46,728
I skipped dinner, but I totally,
totally learned my lesson.

508
00:31:46,729 --> 00:31:49,828
Naomi is underweight,
which is a concern.

509
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:51,428
She's always been thin.

510
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:52,594
I mean, we both have.

511
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:55,428
Can we please just go home now?

512
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:57,294
Can we? Are you sure she's okay?

513
00:31:57,295 --> 00:31:59,694
'Cause I hate hospitals. Sorry.

514
00:31:59,695 --> 00:32:01,428
That's okay. It's common.

515
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:03,761
Yeah, she's fine to go.
Just keep an eye on her.

516
00:32:03,762 --> 00:32:05,894
Water, food, rest.

517
00:32:05,895 --> 00:32:07,561
Dr. Harris.

518
00:32:07,562 --> 00:32:10,494
Thank you.

519
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,461
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

520
00:32:13,729 --> 00:32:17,094
Buddy from this morning,
ATM, stab wounds...

521
00:32:17,095 --> 00:32:19,028
Yeah, Matt Danvers.

522
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:22,128
Right, he also has a
puncture to one of his lungs.

523
00:32:22,129 --> 00:32:23,994
So we'll monitor him for a few days,

524
00:32:23,995 --> 00:32:25,394
but he is gonna need another surgery.

525
00:32:25,395 --> 00:32:27,361
Have you told his wife?

526
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,662
Um...

527
00:32:33,062 --> 00:32:34,794
Now that it's bad,
you don't want to tell her.

528
00:32:34,795 --> 00:32:36,928
You know, it's just because
you're so much better at it

529
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:39,028
than I am, so much better.

530
00:32:45,495 --> 00:32:47,794
Sonia, hi. How are you doing?

531
00:32:47,795 --> 00:32:50,228
I... I can't even make
the simplest decision.

532
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:51,628
Mars Bar or Henry!?

533
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:54,661
It should be easy.

534
00:32:59,095 --> 00:33:01,561
Mary, it's Joel.

535
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,761
Look, I've thought about it.

536
00:33:02,762 --> 00:33:04,461
And I'm ready to take the next step.

537
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:05,561
Call me.

538
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:18,561
Yeah.

539
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:21,094
Hey.

540
00:33:21,095 --> 00:33:24,994
Hey. Can I come in?

541
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:27,862
Yeah, yeah.

542
00:33:31,895 --> 00:33:33,861
I got your message.

543
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:36,428
I was in the area, so...

544
00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:37,894
I should have called first.

545
00:33:37,895 --> 00:33:41,128
No, no, it's... it's good.

546
00:33:41,129 --> 00:33:43,961
I'm... I'm glad you're here.

547
00:33:43,962 --> 00:33:47,828
It's a lonely business, dying.

548
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:50,494
How have you been coping?

549
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:53,894
This pamphlet is full of
some enlightening bullshit.

550
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:57,194
It is, isn't it?

551
00:33:57,195 --> 00:33:59,661
Like we should all follow
the same patterns of grief.

552
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,394
But it's not like that.

553
00:34:02,395 --> 00:34:04,561
Pain is subjective.

554
00:34:04,562 --> 00:34:07,661
Suffering is subjective.

555
00:34:07,662 --> 00:34:09,428
Why are you doing this?

556
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:11,094
What?

557
00:34:11,095 --> 00:34:12,762
Saving people a trip to Switzerland.

558
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,594
Is it the money?

559
00:34:17,595 --> 00:34:20,961
No, the money...

560
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:23,128
it's just so I know people are serious.

561
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:25,262
Okay, so what is it?

562
00:34:27,362 --> 00:34:30,028
Short answer, I believe
we should be in control

563
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:31,894
of our life and our death.

564
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:34,094
That's liberty.

565
00:34:34,095 --> 00:34:35,628
And dying isn't a crime.

566
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:38,628
No, but helping people
die makes you a criminal.

567
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:41,328
You think so?

568
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:45,829
I mean, yeah.

569
00:34:52,995 --> 00:34:56,029
Is there a long answer?

570
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:03,229
Man, I can't.

571
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:06,228
I can't.

572
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,928
Mary?

573
00:35:08,929 --> 00:35:10,629
- That hurt.
- You okay?

574
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:20,462
I'm sorry.

575
00:35:51,862 --> 00:35:53,362
You don't seem sick.

576
00:35:57,262 --> 00:35:59,128
I'm sorry.

577
00:35:59,129 --> 00:36:01,129
I meant that as a compliment. I...

578
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:07,594
We should... we should
do this thing now.

579
00:36:07,595 --> 00:36:08,794
Now?

580
00:36:08,795 --> 00:36:11,694
Yeah, now. You should give me the drink.

581
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:13,361
I... I can't.

582
00:36:13,362 --> 00:36:14,761
Yeah, you can. You can.

583
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:17,061
I'm ready, so give me the drink, okay?

584
00:36:17,062 --> 00:36:19,061
- Give me the drink, Mary.
- I don't have it.

585
00:36:19,062 --> 00:36:20,428
What do you mean, you don't have it?

586
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,394
Well, there's protocol. I can't just...

587
00:36:22,395 --> 00:36:24,494
What, was... was this...

588
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:26,294
and this is all part of your protocol?

589
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:28,629
No, that... that was...

590
00:36:29,795 --> 00:36:31,195
I'm ready.

591
00:36:32,395 --> 00:36:33,562
I can't do it.

592
00:36:42,195 --> 00:36:46,761
Mary. Mary, wait, wait.

593
00:36:46,762 --> 00:36:48,228
I'm sorry.

594
00:36:48,229 --> 00:36:49,561
I'm sorry.

595
00:36:49,562 --> 00:36:51,894
I'm just... I'm really
messed up right now.

596
00:36:51,895 --> 00:36:53,494
It's okay. I get it.

597
00:36:53,495 --> 00:36:55,994
You know, for a second, I...

598
00:36:55,995 --> 00:36:57,628
I completely forgot
I was sick, you know.

599
00:36:57,629 --> 00:36:59,328
I know.

600
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:00,662
Can you come back inside?

601
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,095
Please?

602
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:12,462
I'm... I'm sorry, Joel.

603
00:37:41,995 --> 00:37:43,728
Why are you still here?

604
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:45,061
Passed her on the way out.

605
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,595
Turned the cameras on.

606
00:37:48,462 --> 00:37:50,394
You had sex with our target.

607
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:52,295
You had sex with a murderer.

608
00:37:54,429 --> 00:37:56,794
You're done.

609
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:58,328
No, no. Come on, man.
We've to get rid of it.

610
00:37:58,329 --> 00:37:59,894
I can't make that happen.

611
00:37:59,895 --> 00:38:01,661
This is the closest
thing we have to evidence.

612
00:38:01,662 --> 00:38:03,128
It's unfortunate your dick
was in her at the time, but...

613
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:04,261
Frank...

614
00:38:04,262 --> 00:38:05,502
Don't put me in this situation.

615
00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:09,294
Okay, you mean like the situation

616
00:38:09,295 --> 00:38:14,194
you put me in last year, where
I lied for you under oath?

617
00:38:14,195 --> 00:38:15,494
Come on, man. It was nothing.

618
00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:17,161
A momentary lapse of judgment.

619
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:19,128
She's gonna say you had sex, Ben.

620
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:20,994
And no one is gonna believe her

621
00:38:20,995 --> 00:38:26,194
if we get rid of the tape.

622
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:40,028
Tomorrow we get her to
deliver on the drugs.

623
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:42,361
We arrest her.

624
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:45,229
End of story.

625
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,468
Hey.

626
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:03,234
I... I just got home
and saw the light on.

627
00:39:03,235 --> 00:39:05,901
What's going on? Are you okay?

628
00:39:05,902 --> 00:39:09,001
- I think Naomi's lying.
- About what?

629
00:39:09,002 --> 00:39:10,101
I don't think she fainted.

630
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:12,334
I think she might have taken the...

631
00:39:12,335 --> 00:39:14,834
there was this stuff, these bottles.

632
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:16,834
They were right here.

633
00:39:16,835 --> 00:39:18,834
It's called pentobarbital.

634
00:39:18,835 --> 00:39:20,334
And I looked it up on the internet.

635
00:39:20,335 --> 00:39:22,201
And it said that people
use it for insomnia

636
00:39:22,202 --> 00:39:23,634
and getting high and...

637
00:39:23,635 --> 00:39:24,902
Euthanasia.

638
00:39:26,135 --> 00:39:28,334
Yeah.

639
00:39:28,335 --> 00:39:29,902
Why do you have that stuff in here?

640
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:36,735
I didn't want to tell
you girls just yet, but...

641
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:44,301
It's for Casper.

642
00:39:44,302 --> 00:39:46,234
What's wrong with Casper?

643
00:39:46,235 --> 00:39:48,168
He has cancer.

644
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:51,968
He needs to be put down, and
I wanted to do it at home.

645
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:54,334
Casper's sick?

646
00:39:54,335 --> 00:39:55,969
I'm sorry.

647
00:40:00,135 --> 00:40:01,834
Why is everything so
messed up right now?

648
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:03,501
Everything?

649
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:07,201
Yeah, you're never home,
and Dad's dating Louise,

650
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:11,668
and Naomi, she... she's just
all over the place with me,

651
00:40:11,669 --> 00:40:15,501
and I'm really worried about her.

652
00:40:15,502 --> 00:40:17,634
Jess, I'm gonna level with you.

653
00:40:17,635 --> 00:40:20,034
Life can get really messed up sometimes.

654
00:40:20,035 --> 00:40:23,668
And every now and then, it'll just...

655
00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:25,302
have its way with you.

656
00:40:27,502 --> 00:40:28,535
What do we do?

657
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:32,669
We get strong.

658
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:38,868
Why aren't you answering your phone?

659
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,368
I didn't wasn't aware I was on-call.

660
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:41,368
Why do you have a cat?

661
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:43,734
I really messed up.

662
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:45,934
Larissa, Mary.

663
00:40:45,935 --> 00:40:47,901
Cute kitty.

664
00:40:47,902 --> 00:40:49,334
Mary, Larissa.

665
00:40:49,335 --> 00:40:50,368
Mary and I work together.

666
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:52,268
You work with the sick kids too?

667
00:40:53,402 --> 00:40:54,801
Yep.

668
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:57,401
Yeah, the... I work with the sick kids.

669
00:40:57,402 --> 00:40:59,168
That is so awesome.

670
00:40:59,169 --> 00:41:00,234
Yeah, yeah.

671
00:41:00,235 --> 00:41:02,268
Listen, doll, can we reconvene later?

672
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:03,829
'Cause Mary and I have some work to do.

673
00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:19,701
Save those kids.

674
00:41:23,969 --> 00:41:25,901
- Sick kids?
- It's my alibi.

675
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:27,134
The cat, explain.

676
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:28,468
Casper.

677
00:41:28,469 --> 00:41:30,968
Can I ask you to cat-sit?

678
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:35,134
Please say yes. Don't ask why.

679
00:41:35,135 --> 00:41:37,168
I had sex with Joel.

680
00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:41,434
It's not funny.

681
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:43,334
You gave a dying man a good time.

682
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,068
- There's no harm there.
- I took advantage of him.

683
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,301
Women can't take
advantage of men sexually.

684
00:41:47,302 --> 00:41:48,334
It's biologically impossible.

685
00:41:48,335 --> 00:41:49,968
And then he lost it on me.

686
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:52,668
Yeah, well, it happens
to the best of us.

687
00:41:52,669 --> 00:41:55,901
No, I'm not talking about that.

688
00:41:55,902 --> 00:41:59,101
No, afterwards, he went crazy,
begging me for the drink,

689
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:01,168
begging to die.

690
00:42:01,169 --> 00:42:03,868
God, you're like a... a praying mantis.

691
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:06,534
You have sex with them
and then kill them.

692
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,701
We need to make this right.

693
00:42:10,702 --> 00:42:11,901
So?

694
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:15,401
So tomorrow, we end Joel's suffering.

695
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:17,268
Okay. We will.

696
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:20,501
We're good at that.

697
00:42:20,502 --> 00:42:24,134
You know, I've been thinking.

698
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:26,469
I really need to quit.

699
00:42:27,902 --> 00:42:29,468
Killing people?

700
00:42:29,469 --> 00:42:31,034
No, smoking.

701
00:42:31,035 --> 00:42:32,534
No, yeah, you're right. You should.

702
00:42:32,535 --> 00:42:34,234
It's a filthy habit.

703
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:36,601
- We can't quit helping people.
- No, of course.

704
00:42:36,602 --> 00:42:40,401
You're like Joan of
Arc, on a divine mission.

705
00:42:40,402 --> 00:42:42,368
She got burned alive.

706
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:45,668
Yeah, in a blaze of glory.

707
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:50,401
I guess we all got to go some way.

708

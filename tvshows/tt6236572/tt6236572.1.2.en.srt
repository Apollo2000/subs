1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:01,933
Two new cases.

2
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:04,202
Nora's a widow. 80.
Acute renal failure.

3
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:06,038
She's choosing
not to do dialysis.

4
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,906
<i>Joel has
an inoperable brain tumor.</i>

5
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,741
<i>I gave them both your number.</i>

6
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:11,176
Joel?

7
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,446
You had sex with our target.

8
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,348
We arrest her. End of story.

9
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,517
Is this your mom's?
She's not a drug dealer.

10
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:19,685
She's a doctor.

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,486
<i>Naomi collapsed onstage.</i>

12
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,754
Honey, what did you take?

13
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,656
That stuff that was
in your shed.

14
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,091
Please don't tell my mom.

15
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,459
I fainted.

16
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:28,727
I think naomi's lying.

17
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,040
These bottles.
They were right here.

18
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,197
It's for casper.
He needs to be put down.

19
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,565
I need more pento.

20
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,978
Wanted to make sure
that you were using.

21
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,046
And that you weren't selling.

22
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,137
I, troy dixon,
choose to take my life.

23
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,206
Pentobarbital with champagne.

24
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:52,284
Okay, ladies, let's see this.

25
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,186
And up, down.

26
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,787
And up.

27
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:57,255
And four,

28
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,292
Three, two, one.

29
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:01,993
Let's just twist. Whoo!

30
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,465
Twist it out! Come on!

31
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,236
Shake 'em!

32
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,472
Whoo! Here we go!

33
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,768
Legs feeling better, nora? Much.

34
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,569
The swelling's gone down.

35
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,339
The water always helps.

36
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,307
Well, see you next friday.

37
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,412
Good-bye, edith.

38
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,564
Edward and I used to come here
every weekend.

39
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,133
We'd sit here
just where you two are right now.

40
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,135
And watch the birds.

41
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,604
How was your swim, nora?
It was lovely,

42
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,608
Just to be in the water
one last time.

43
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,777
And thank you
for accommodating me,

44
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,446
Meeting me here.

45
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:32,951
I know it's a risk, but this is
such a beautiful place to die.

46
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,921
A little risk makes life
exciting, doesn't it?

47
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,024
Do you have any questions
or concerns?

48
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,258
Anything on your mind?

49
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,127
You've been wonderful.

50
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,096
I'm just happy
to have this choice.

51
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:55,006
Edward was a scientist.

52
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,309
He always used to tell me,

53
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:01,947
Energy is not created
or destroyed.

54
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,216
It just is.

55
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:09,754
I believe every bit of him is
still around,

56
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,756
Just in a different form.

57
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,127
That's beautiful.

58
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,796
It's true.

59
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,907
She's gone.

60
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,910
I'm sure.

61
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,878
Never gonna let it go, are you?

62
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,618
See? This is how it should be.

63
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,987
Say good-bye when you're ready
in a place you love.

64
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,957
It should be, but it's not,
so let's skedaddle.

65
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,093
Someone will find her, right?

66
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,929
God, yeah.
One hour, this place will be.

67
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,230
Swarming with people.

68
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,798
She left us a tip.

69
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,567
$5 each. Classic grandma.

70
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,302
Aww.

71
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,536
What about joel?

72
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:34,205
What about him? Come on.

73
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,643
I was reviewing the journals
on gbm tumors last night,

74
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,579
And there are several
new treatment options.

75
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,147
My god, you had sex with him,

76
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,394
And now you think you two are
gonna live happily ever after.

77
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,685
He's dying.
And you are such a woman.

78
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,153
I'm not a woman. I'm a doctor.

79
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,487
I'm doing my due diligence.

80
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,656
Yeah, you are,
duly and diligently.

81
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,281
Mary.

82
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,317
Hi.

83
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,321
Hey.

84
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,228
Do you want anything?

85
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,731
The coffee here is... it's bad.

86
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,199
It's very bad.

87
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,067
I'm used to bad coffee.

88
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,570
You know, hospitals and all.

89
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,843
I used to work in a place like
this when I was in med school.

90
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,545
<i>Covered my coffee,
covered my rent.</i>

91
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:50,482
<i>Really?
So no help from mom and dad?</i>

92
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,219
No mom, no dad.

93
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:00,492
I'm sorry it took me a couple
days to get back to you.

94
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,961
But I still want to help.

95
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,929
Great.
I mean, that... that is great.

96
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:11,736
So, as you know,
glioblastoma progresses quickly.

97
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:15,173
Everything looks fine,
and then you get one bad cell.

98
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,142
And then it multiplies,
and it multiplies...

99
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:20,979
And it multiplies, yeah.
So, why are you telling me this?

100
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,483
Joel, the thing is,
people are working on it.

101
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,086
It's actually quite exciting.

102
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,523
And a friend of mine is doing
a clinical trial next month.

103
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,259
He's looking for candidates.

104
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,860
You're serious?

105
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,128
Yeah.

106
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,279
Jesus.
Now she's trying to save me.

107
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,481
Just roll with me, okay?
I'm gonna break her.

108
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,749
Joel, wait!

109
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,689
You'd be perfect
for one of these trials.

110
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,069
I mean, you're young.
You're strong.

111
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,027
You know, I've had
so much chemo and radiation...

112
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,963
Enough to kill everything
inside of me except the tumor...

113
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,364
In my brain, which is probably.

114
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,166
The only part of me
I ever really liked.

115
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,835
I'm only trying to help you.

116
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,637
You really think
there's something to fix, mary?

117
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,407
There's nothing to fix, okay?
I'm dying.

118
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,077
So, this... this whole thing
you're doing, it's...

119
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,412
It's mean.

120
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,884
Joel.

121
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,875
I need to ask you something,
mom.

122
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,012
What is it, love?

123
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,248
Can you make me
a grilled cheese sandwich?

124
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,582
'Cause I'm really hungry.

125
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,920
You little.

126
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,758
How you doing, yvonne?

127
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,667
No more hospitals.
No more treatments.

128
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,068
No more.

129
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,038
I want to... I want to go home.

130
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,742
Okay.

131
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:37,549
I'll speak to the doctor today
and try and get you discharged.

132
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:41,386
I can connect you with
the hospital's palliative care.

133
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,057
No.

134
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,027
Charlie, no.

135
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,064
Charlie, what is it?

136
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,002
My mom wants to know.

137
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,638
How much morphine
it would take to...

138
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,714
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,683
I can't tell you that.

140
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,228
I have someone
that I can refer you to.

141
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,396
An independent
end-of-life counselor.

142
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,399
Who can give you
further recommendations.

143
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,837
Just trust me.

144
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,752
This one's urgent.

145
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,421
Yvonne kowalchuk. Als.

146
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,290
It's bad. Late stages.

147
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,392
Well, end stages, really.

148
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,860
She was released this morning,

149
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,829
And her son's been
caring for her.

150
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,336
I quit.

151
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,405
It won't last.

152
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,275
You underestimate my willpower.

153
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,210
Um, how old is her son?

154
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:15,146
Charlie. 15.

155
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,881
And he understands?

156
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,851
He supports his mother's
decision wholeheartedly.

157
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,319
He's a great kid.

158
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,290
Nora.

159
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,660
Nora? I thought
this would be for joel.

160
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,061
Joel is still with us.

161
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,497
This isn't a same-day
delivery service, okay?

162
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,310
I haven't yet confirmed
he's a good candidate.

163
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,267
He's terminal. He wants to die.

164
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,137
I know, and he's exhibiting.

165
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,673
Highs and lows,
erratic behavior.

166
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,808
I just want to make sure
he knows what he wants.

167
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,476
Okay. Whatever.

168
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,179
But I am personally vouching
for yvonne, okay?

169
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,748
It is imminent, so, please,
no foreplay.

170
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,353
I promised charlie, all right?

171
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,455
So, you do have feelings.

172
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,191
Buried somewhere deep down,
yeah.

173
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,628
I'll see her later today.

174
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,030
Thank you.

175
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,533
Good luck with withdrawal.

176
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,541
<i>Hello? - Dr. Harris.</i>

177
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,409
<i>I'm dr. Adrian carmichael.</i>

178
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,478
<i>I'm calling on behalf
of joel collins.</i>

179
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,480
<i>I understand
you're working with him.</i>

180
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,384
Yes, joel came to eden general
seeking palliative care.

181
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,819
<i>Yes, I know. He called me.</i>

182
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,420
He told me that
you're pushing him.

183
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,589
Towards clinical trials.

184
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,758
Not pushing,
but I mentioned them, yes.

185
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,193
I want to make sure he's aware.

186
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,562
He is aware.

187
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:40,832
Look... We've treated his tumor
with aggressive radiation.

188
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,467
And chemo... the whole nine.

189
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,803
Okay, but did you ever discuss
a more radical treatment.

190
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,406
Like stem cell trials, osmrs?

191
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,676
I assure you.
We've tried everything.

192
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,847
I do hope that eden general can
accommodate his needs.

193
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:59,183
<i>He's suffered enough.</i>

194
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,185
You're right.

195
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,687
Thank you.

196
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,526
Good job.

197
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,161
Yeah!

198
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,763
I miss it, man.

199
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,398
I miss it.

200
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,611
As soon as my wife divorces me,
I'm going back to undercover.

201
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,969
All right, come on.
Wendy is great.

202
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:21,072
Yeah, wendy's standing
between me and my damn dreams.

203
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,740
Your dreams?

204
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,275
Yeah.

205
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,877
You ever see
those heated driveways?

206
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,178
No, I...

207
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,248
Melts the snow right off.
Well, I want one, bad.

208
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,750
But wendy thinks
it's frivolous, unnecessary.

209
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,963
Yeah, that's because I'm the one.

210
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,064
That's shoveling
the damn driveway.

211
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,154
Every time it snows.

212
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,122
You need better dreams, my man.

213
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:45,296
I bet you know almost every
entry in that journal by now.

214
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,532
Yeah, almost.

215
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,333
You spoken to his father yet?

216
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,568
Not since the first meeting.

217
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,804
But he's coming in tonight
for a debrief.

218
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,105
I want to deliver.

219
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,540
Tonight?

220
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,075
He's a judge. He's a busy man.

221
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,242
Man.

222
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,646
Hey, when you get mary,
and you will,

223
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:05,550
You need her to tell you
exactly what she's going to do...

224
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,752
An incriminating statement
that will hold up in court.

225
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,287
I know, man.
I've done it before.

226
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,155
All right, good.

227
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,890
Just go give her
those puppy dog eyes,

228
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,425
Get this bitch to kill you.

229
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,896
Jumpy.

230
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,397
Hey, we're packed
to go to dad's.

231
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,299
You guys have any fun plans
tonight?

232
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,068
Whee! Shoes on the bed!

233
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,669
Me and naomi are going
to tristan's.

234
00:13:58,705 --> 00:13:59,937
He's having some people over.

235
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,439
Naomi and i.

236
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,174
Me and naomi.

237
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,876
How is she?

238
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,578
She's telling everybody
at school.

239
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,814
She had a near-death experience.

240
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,149
What's a near-death experience?

241
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,353
It's just a way
of getting attention.

242
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,132
You know, if anything happens
again with her,

243
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,924
You can come to me, right?

244
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,292
Yeah.

245
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,526
Hey, mama?

246
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:25,162
Yeah? Where's casper?

247
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:37,108
Put those in the bin. Thank you!

248
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,312
Whoa, you okay? Yep, I got it.

249
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,915
Hey, mary. Hi.

250
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,552
Naomi, how you feeling?

251
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,188
You know, still breathing.

252
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,258
You know you can take that off.

253
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,027
Yeah, I know.

254
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,329
I just kind of like it.

255
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,900
Our cat is dead.

256
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,503
No.
I wanted to wait a little bit.

257
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,606
Before I told her,
but she asked, so...

258
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,444
Hey. What's going on?

259
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,780
Casper died.

260
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,148
Really?

261
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,816
But he was only, what? Seven?

262
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,652
Cancer. It was all over.

263
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,821
I had to, um, put him down.

264
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,256
I think you did the right thing.

265
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,502
You know,
when they're suffering,

266
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,226
It's the only option.

267
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,796
Can I have ice cream
since I'm sad?

268
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,764
Give me a hug. Of course.

269
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,301
Love you. Bye.

270
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,736
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,877
God, I loved that dumb cat.

272
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,413
You should've told me.

273
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,815
He's in a better place now.

274
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,050
I have to get that.

275
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,919
Hey.

276
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,087
Um...

277
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,023
You're late
on your child support.

278
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,459
I just gave you two grand
in cash.

279
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,794
Right.
But when am I getting the rest?

280
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,164
I'll bring it
when I pick up the girls.

281
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,237
Yeah?
Are you on your way to yvonne's?

282
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,872
Yeah. Leaving in five.

283
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,141
<i>Okay. I'm heading there now.</i>

284
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,678
Hey, des, never get married.

285
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,781
You're the only woman
I want in my life permanently,

286
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,916
<i>Which is why I keep rejecting
your sexual advances.</i>

287
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,153
I have another call
I have to take.

288
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,288
I'll... I'll meet you there.

289
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,030
Hi, joel.
I'm sorry about earlier.

290
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:43,267
You said don't buy a gun.

291
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,136
What? You said don't buy a gun.

292
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,371
You said that you would help me.

293
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,873
I want to help you. I do.

294
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,608
You know what? It's fine.

295
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,543
It's fine. I got this.

296
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,111
<i>Good-bye, mary.</i>

297
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,582
Joel!

298
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,728
Joel!

299
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,229
Joel!

300
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,509
What are you doing?

301
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,513
What I should've done
in the first place.

302
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,450
You don't want to do this.
Yes, I do.

303
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,418
Not like this.

304
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,227
You should help me.

305
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,004
I'll help you.

306
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,444
<i>You can lie down.</i>

307
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,745
<i>Thanks.</i>

308
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,756
The money.

309
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,827
I don't want it.

310
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,329
Why?

311
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,699
I just don't.

312
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,235
What am I gonna do with it?

313
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,569
Please take it.

314
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,748
Come on, I don't want charity.

315
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,706
Please. Please.

316
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,515
<i>What medications are you taking?</i>

317
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,885
<i>Carbamazepine. Anti-seizure.</i>

318
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,987
When did you take
your last dose?

319
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,555
This morning.

320
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,326
Is there anyone
you want to say good-bye to?

321
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:52,496
Do you want to take a moment.

322
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:55,766
Or make any phone calls?

323
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,234
No.

324
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:08,045
Can you tell me again?

325
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,014
Tell you what?

326
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,183
Tell me how you're gonna do it.

327
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:16,954
What do you mean?

328
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,423
How you're gonna kill me.

329
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,127
I mean, I know you... you told me
how they do it in switzerland,

330
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:27,331
But just... i really want to hear
how you're gonna do it.

331
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:43,414
I need to wash my hands.

332
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:44,882
Yeah, the sink's right there.

333
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,518
Where's your bathroom?

334
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,153
<i>Down the hall.</i>

335
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,711
So, you took carbamazepine
this morning?

336
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,146
Yeah.

337
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,181
Can I see the bottle?

338
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,493
I need to know
what I'm working with.

339
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,484
I threw it out this morning.

340
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,552
I thought it was my last dose.

341
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,324
I need to get your file.
It's in my car.

342
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,627
Why do you have to get my file?

343
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,996
I need to confirm
your medication.

344
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:07,331
Maybe you could take a moment.

345
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:11,168
To think about what
you're grateful for...

346
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,337
All the good things in life.

347
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,017
You're gonna need a drink,
so why don't you.

348
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,674
Grab a beer from the fridge?

349
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,809
I'll be right back.

350
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,954
I've been waiting half an hour.

351
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,823
Des, he's a cop!

352
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,425
<i>Who? - Joel!</i>

353
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,561
I'm at his apartment right now.
I almost killed him.

354
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,364
How the hell do they know?
You think it's your nurse?

355
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,367
Never. She would never do that.

356
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,035
Look. I'm leaving now.

357
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,704
But we can't do yvonne.
Not tonight.

358
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,105
So go in, make nice,
and tell her.

359
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,273
<i>We'll be back next week.</i>

360
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,909
Get out, now.

361
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,730
.Yeah, talk fast.

362
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,443
She's by her car.
Can't see what she's doing.

363
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,467
<i>I'm going in.</i>

364
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,545
No. No, no, no. I'm coming down.

365
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,368
I'm coming down.

366
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:27,344
Mary! Hey! Hey!

367
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,679
God.

368
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,685
Hey. What are you doing?

369
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:39,089
So, did you think about it?

370
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,458
Think... think about what?

371
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:42,726
What you're grateful for.

372
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:44,261
Yes.

373
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,395
Yes. I'm grateful for you.

374
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:46,697
Here.

375
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,302
Joel, listen to me.

376
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,637
You're obviously upset
and struggling.

377
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,973
But, you know, to be honest,
you kind of scare me.

378
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,142
Why do I scare you?

379
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,043
I wanted to help you
and counsel you,

380
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,881
But the gun,
the erratic behavior, i...

381
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,449
I just don't feel safe.

382
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,650
I have to go now.

383
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,519
No, please don't go.
Just take the money.

384
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,787
Please. Mary.

385
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:12,790
Mary!

386
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,376
Things w-

387
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,811
She knows.

388
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,179
Nah. She likes you better alive.

389
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:38,181
She knows.

390
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,619
This is gonna be
a hell of a debrief.

391
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,420
Yeah, what time
are we meeting judge grant?

392
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:45,822
He's waiting for us now.

393
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,166
And the second I turn 18,

394
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,668
I'm gonna move to new york.
Yeah?

395
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:00,315
Hey, so, we said
we'd be home an hour ago.

396
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,572
We should probably...

397
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,340
It's fine.
They haven't even called us yet.

398
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:05,708
It's fine. It's fine.

399
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,643
So, have you seen that movie
"cabaret"?

400
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,757
No. You've seen that movie.

401
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,745
Of course you've seen
that movie.

402
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,049
Well,
I'm gonna be just like them.

403
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:16,053
Yeah.
Dancing and singing for money.

404
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,821
I get it. Yeah.

405
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:21,390
You're gonna be a star. Right?

406
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:22,692
Yeah.

407
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:25,262
Okay.

408
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,233
What are you doing?

409
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,700
It's cocaine.

410
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,743
Stole it from my dad.

411
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:41,111
You want some?

412
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,080
No, I don't. I do.

413
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,349
Hey, naomi,
you were just in the hospital.

414
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,985
You had a...
You had a really bad night.

415
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,391
What does it feel like?

416
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:59,263
It makes you feel
like you're a star.

417
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,063
Okay. Okay?

418
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,274
That's...

419
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,078
I don't want to wake her.

420
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,546
She doesn't sleep much
these days.

421
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,681
That's okay. I understand.

422
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:22,986
The thing is, charlie,
we have a bit of a situation.

423
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,022
My mom wanted me
to show you this.

424
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,700
<i>I've had a blessed life.</i>

425
00:25:40,104 --> 00:25:43,072
<i>I have my beautiful boy,
charlie.</i>

426
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:46,310
<i>And when this is all over,
he'll go live with his dad,</i>

427
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:50,279
<i>And maybe he'll even get
a better haircut.</i>

428
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:57,687
<i>I've lived exactly the life</i>

429
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,290
<i>I wanted to live.</i>

430
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:02,025
<i>When it's time,</i>

431
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:07,029
<i>I want the choice to die...</i>

432
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,000
<i>The way I want to die.</i>

433
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:26,216
How much is it again?

434
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,783
Charlie, we...

435
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,290
I'm afraid we're gonna have to
postpone your mom's appointment.

436
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,491
I don't get it.

437
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,094
We can't help your mom.
Not today.

438
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,563
Annie said you'd do it today.
She made a mistake.

439
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,801
But mom's ready. I'm ready!

440
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,737
I know. I know.

441
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:52,208
I'm... I'm sorry.

442
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:54,877
What?

443
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,746
Hey. Hey, don't leave.

444
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,350
I'm sorry, charlie.

445
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:05,321
I said don't leave!

446
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:16,132
How'd it go with yvonne?
Not great.

447
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,667
I'm here with charlie now,

448
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:19,536
And he's...
He's pointing a gun at my head.

449
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,437
What? It's a small gun,

450
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,373
But it's still a... a gun,
nonetheless.

451
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,243
<i>Tell her to come over. Please.</i>

452
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,710
<i>He said he wants you
to come over.</i>

453
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,147
Annie promised.
She said you'd help us tonight,

454
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,358
So you're gonna help us tonight.

455
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:32,683
<i>He said we're gonna help him...</i>

456
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,851
I heard.

457
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,020
What's she saying?

458
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38,754
She said, "."

459
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,757
My mom can't breathe.
She can't even move.

460
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:42,993
You have to help her.

461
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:45,962
Guys, I had to get rid
of the pento.

462
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,431
What? What?

463
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:49,498
What is it?

464
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,935
Charlie,
we don't have the drugs.

465
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:55,404
Stop messing with me.

466
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,839
I'm not, all right?

467
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,408
<i>So you can stop
pointing the gun at me.</i>

468
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,210
<i>I'm gonna leave now.</i>

469
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,011
Okay? Don't go.

470
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,513
Easy. I said don't go!

471
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:05,882
Please don't go!

472
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,583
Aah!

473
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,357
Everything's all right, mom.
It's okay.

474
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,558
Des? Des!

475
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,527
<i>Des, are you okay?</i>

476
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,328
I'm so sorry.
I didn't think it was loaded.

477
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,909
I... i've never even
held it before, i...

478
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,699
My god, des, say something!

479
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,368
Get me a towel!

480
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:27,904
Shoulder wound.

481
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,806
I'd call it a graze,
but it hurts like hell.

482
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:34,521
<i>You said it was a graze.
Is that true? Is that right?</i>

483
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:36,545
Yeah, sure.

484
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,848
Please. I have no one else.

485
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,792
I really think
we need to help charlie.

486
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,862
Okay, um, des,

487
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,764
You need to give me the name
of your dealer.

488
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,098
That's a bad idea.

489
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,835
You know another way
to get pento on short notice?

490
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,703
All right.

491
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,373
His name's grady.

492
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,741
<i>I'll send you his address,
let him know you're coming.</i>

493
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:08,078
Mary...

494
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:09,846
Mary, he's not a good person.

495
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:11,714
I can handle it.
Send the address.

496
00:29:29,442 --> 00:29:31,008
Hi.

497
00:29:31,044 --> 00:29:32,977
I'm mary, des's friend.

498
00:29:34,347 --> 00:29:36,714
Hi, mary.

499
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:38,683
Can you take your shirt off?

500
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:44,121
Are you kidding?

501
00:29:45,525 --> 00:29:47,959
No. I'm not the one laughing.

502
00:29:51,197 --> 00:29:52,997
I'm not taking off my shirt.

503
00:29:53,032 --> 00:29:57,835
Mary, in my business,
if I sell to the wrong client,

504
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,905
Then they make me live in a cage
for 20 years.

505
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,274
So, your politeness
and your modesty.

506
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:05,810
Is not a high priority for me.

507
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,279
You don't need to trust me
to take my money.

508
00:30:11,484 --> 00:30:13,918
Take your shirt off, mary.

509
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,632
Happy? Yeah.

510
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:29,266
Of course.

511
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:31,168
I have a very good life.

512
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,371
And I'm very happy
that you're not wearing a wire.

513
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,241
You don't have track marks.

514
00:30:37,276 --> 00:30:39,777
The pento's not for me.
It's for des.

515
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,481
I just gave him a full box
the other day.

516
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:47,218
He lost it.

517
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:53,157
He lost it?

518
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,627
Can I buy more from you?

519
00:30:56,663 --> 00:30:58,562
I mean, that's what you do,
right?

520
00:30:58,598 --> 00:31:00,464
Do you have any kids?

521
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:04,602
I really have to get back
to des.

522
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:05,736
He's in rough shape.

523
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:07,838
I have this little
step-niece, maya.

524
00:31:07,874 --> 00:31:09,573
She's six.

525
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:11,976
She's sleeping over.

526
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:13,911
And she just plays.

527
00:31:13,946 --> 00:31:16,213
Color for hours.

528
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,949
Love that kid.

529
00:31:18,985 --> 00:31:22,620
She's the cutest little thing.

530
00:31:27,293 --> 00:31:29,760
You're kind of cute too.

531
00:31:32,465 --> 00:31:34,365
You look good.

532
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,600
Sid,

533
00:31:36,636 --> 00:31:41,005
Would you get dr. Mary harris
of 228 maple drive.

534
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,474
What she came here for tonight?

535
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,592
You can count it if you want.

536
00:32:01,627 --> 00:32:04,261
Nah, we're good.

537
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,531
Hey, mary?

538
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:08,567
Smile.

539
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,112
Judge grant,
sorry to keep you waiting.

540
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,080
I don't mind waiting
if it's for a good reason.

541
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:27,151
"Joel" just met with dr. Harris.

542
00:32:27,186 --> 00:32:29,120
And? We're close.

543
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,222
Close?

544
00:32:31,257 --> 00:32:32,990
I don't understand how it is.

545
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:34,203
That you guys don't have
enough evidence.

546
00:32:34,227 --> 00:32:36,060
Aren't these meetings
being recorded?

547
00:32:36,095 --> 00:32:37,895
Yes, but unfortunately
we don't have.

548
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,597
Anything incriminating
on tape as yet.

549
00:32:39,632 --> 00:32:41,832
The... the suspect's working
under the pretense.

550
00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:43,934
Of being some kind
of end-of-life counselor.

551
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,070
What about the nurse
ethan mentioned in his journal?

552
00:32:46,105 --> 00:32:49,607
Annie chung. Works in the
intensive care at eden general.

553
00:32:49,642 --> 00:32:51,942
The nurse is
just the liaison, sir.

554
00:32:51,978 --> 00:32:54,211
I mean, she connects
the patients to dr. Harris.

555
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:56,147
We burn her,
we burn the whole operation.

556
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,815
Sir, look.
We know this is difficult,

557
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,428
But the best way
to bring dr. Harris down is.

558
00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:00,751
To catch her in the act.

559
00:33:00,787 --> 00:33:03,020
Gentlemen,
my son had another year.

560
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:04,388
He could've done
a clinical trial.

561
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:05,534
He could've done
a million things.

562
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:06,769
What he could not have done was.

563
00:33:06,793 --> 00:33:08,359
Give consent,
which makes this murder.

564
00:33:08,394 --> 00:33:09,693
I assure you, sir,

565
00:33:09,729 --> 00:33:12,263
If dr. Harris helped your son
die, we will prove it.

566
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:13,864
Good.

567
00:33:18,738 --> 00:33:20,871
Charlie!

568
00:33:20,907 --> 00:33:22,473
Gonna need another towel.

569
00:33:26,112 --> 00:33:28,679
Look at that.

570
00:33:28,714 --> 00:33:29,780
Does it hurt?

571
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:31,916
No. It feels lovely.

572
00:33:31,951 --> 00:33:33,317
Seriously, I-i didn't mean to.

573
00:33:33,352 --> 00:33:35,452
Shoot me? Yeah, funny, that.
And yet here we are.

574
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:38,196
There's probably a lesson
about guns.

575
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,658
Embedded in all of this,
charlie?

576
00:33:40,693 --> 00:33:42,760
My mom got the gun
after my dad left,

577
00:33:42,795 --> 00:33:44,495
Said it made her feel safer
at night.

578
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:49,900
She's close.

579
00:33:51,137 --> 00:33:52,203
How can you tell?

580
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,071
I was a doctor, too, charlie.

581
00:33:54,106 --> 00:33:57,274
Well, plastic surgeon.

582
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,343
It was all very pleasant.

583
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:00,611
Until I did something stupid.

584
00:34:00,646 --> 00:34:01,979
And they took my license away.

585
00:34:02,014 --> 00:34:04,548
Thank christ.

586
00:34:10,556 --> 00:34:12,022
Charlie.

587
00:34:13,893 --> 00:34:15,860
It's okay.

588
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,467
It's all gonna be okay.

589
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:30,708
Can I come in?

590
00:34:30,743 --> 00:34:32,676
I got it, I got it, I'm fine.

591
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:34,879
Let's just do this and get out,
okay?

592
00:34:48,194 --> 00:34:49,693
She can't swallow.

593
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:54,498
This is our first injection.

594
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:00,771
It's not quite
how I pictured it.

595
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:16,453
What are you doing?

596
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:19,423
It's her favorite song.

597
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:21,058
Jeez. Des.

598
00:35:39,612 --> 00:35:41,211
You ready to do this, or what?

599
00:35:46,652 --> 00:35:48,118
I love you, mom.

600
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:55,826
I want it to be peaceful.

601
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:57,361
It will be.

602
00:35:58,764 --> 00:36:01,665
Like slipping into a dream
at the end of a long day.

603
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,851
I promise.

604
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:58,833
You got lucky.

605
00:37:58,868 --> 00:38:00,902
Yeah. That's exactly how I feel.

606
00:38:00,937 --> 00:38:03,037
Our last job.

607
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,473
At least we went out
with a bang.

608
00:38:05,508 --> 00:38:07,041
Our last job? Well, I assumed,

609
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,811
Since your gentleman turned out
to be an officer.

610
00:38:09,846 --> 00:38:12,213
Standing there with charlie
tonight, des,

611
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,915
I know what it feels to be him.

612
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,650
I know. Except in my case,

613
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:17,952
There was no one there
willing to help.

614
00:38:19,055 --> 00:38:20,421
Listen to me.

615
00:38:20,456 --> 00:38:23,224
Right now,
they don't have anything on us.

616
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,193
So we just need to be smarter.

617
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:28,329
You know what?

618
00:38:28,364 --> 00:38:31,032
I had a few ideas
while I was bleeding to death.

619
00:38:31,067 --> 00:38:32,867
Aging baby boomers are
gonna want to die.

620
00:38:32,902 --> 00:38:34,535
In the same manner.

621
00:38:34,571 --> 00:38:35,703
Bourgeois comfort.

622
00:38:35,738 --> 00:38:37,338
Now, the swiss, they know that.

623
00:38:37,373 --> 00:38:41,275
That's why death tourism's such
a massive business over there.

624
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:43,177
And? And we should be starting.

625
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:45,980
To buy up property,
getting ready to go legit.

626
00:38:46,015 --> 00:38:47,481
I'm serious.

627
00:38:47,517 --> 00:38:50,685
I'm having a...
An entrepreneurial seizure here.

628
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,121
Let's be a...
A start-up for shutting down.

629
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:57,625
"The spa you'll never
want to leave...

630
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,993
And you won't."

631
00:38:59,028 --> 00:39:00,194
Des... if you're traveling.

632
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,196
The river styx,
why not take a yacht?

633
00:39:02,232 --> 00:39:04,198
Where's the cat?

634
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,770
I think I might have...
Left the window open.

635
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,873
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

636
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:13,986
But there's a reason I've never
been responsible for anyone.

637
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,109
Or anything else.

638
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,255
Except for lives, as a doctor.

639
00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:17,712
Yeah, look how that turned out.

640
00:39:19,015 --> 00:39:22,149
Well, it's a long way to fall.

641
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,863
Why did you do that?

642
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:37,732
I'm mad at you.

643
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,433
My god, don't be mad at me.

644
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:41,702
I hate it when you're mad at me.

645
00:39:41,738 --> 00:39:43,604
Where'd you go last night?

646
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,017
I looked for you,
and you were gone.

647
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:46,140
Yeah, I left,

648
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,975
Because watching you
be a train wreck.

649
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,311
Is just really, really tedious,
so I...

650
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,280
God, seriously,

651
00:39:52,315 --> 00:39:55,750
The cocaine wasn't even
that good.

652
00:39:55,785 --> 00:39:59,120
I mean, all that happened was,
like, everything sped up,

653
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:01,789
And my heart...

654
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,659
Come here. Feel my heart.

655
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,767
Yeah.

656
00:40:12,802 --> 00:40:14,902
You... you didn't faint.

657
00:40:14,938 --> 00:40:17,605
That other night
at our recital, did you?

658
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,206
What?

659
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:22,076
You took the... the stuff
from my mom's shed, right?

660
00:40:24,147 --> 00:40:25,746
I'm sorry.

661
00:40:25,782 --> 00:40:28,983
I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot!

662
00:40:29,018 --> 00:40:31,485
You know, I think there's
something wrong with my brain.

663
00:40:31,521 --> 00:40:32,787
I...

664
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,658
Don't tell anyone
about the drugs, okay?

665
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:42,596
Seriously,
my mom will send me away,

666
00:40:42,632 --> 00:40:44,165
And I'll never see you again.

667
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:49,236
Jess? Please?

668
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:51,205
Yeah. I won't...

669
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,373
If you stop.

670
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,608
God, you sound like your mom.

671
00:40:54,644 --> 00:40:57,111
What do you mean,
I sound like my mom?

672
00:40:57,146 --> 00:40:58,980
At the hospital...

673
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:00,982
I told her I took her drugs
from the shed,

674
00:41:01,017 --> 00:41:03,217
And she said
she wouldn't tell anyone.

675
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,087
If I cleaned up my act.

676
00:41:06,122 --> 00:41:07,355
Wait, she knew about it?

677
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,090
Yeah.

678
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:12,059
And she totally covered
for me, too.

679
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:17,131
I'm hungry. I want breakfast.

680
00:41:30,046 --> 00:41:32,847
Hello?
I, um, my name's carly dixon.

681
00:41:32,882 --> 00:41:36,817
I think you might know...
Or knew... my husband,

682
00:41:36,853 --> 00:41:38,152
Troy dixon.

683
00:41:38,187 --> 00:41:39,987
<i>I found your number
on this pamphlet.</i>

684
00:41:42,892 --> 00:41:44,058
Are you there?

685
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:11,986
Mary. Joel.

686
00:42:13,423 --> 00:42:16,590
No. Wait. You're not, are you?

687
00:42:16,626 --> 00:42:18,125
Not what?

688
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,593
You're not joel.

689
00:42:21,798 --> 00:42:23,064
Ben.

690
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:26,100
Still mary.

691
00:42:29,305 --> 00:42:30,905
I liked you better as joel.

692
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,373
You liked me better dying?

693
00:42:35,778 --> 00:42:37,578
Do you think I'm a criminal?

694
00:42:37,613 --> 00:42:39,713
What you're doing is
very illegal.

695
00:42:39,749 --> 00:42:42,083
What's illegal?

696
00:42:42,118 --> 00:42:44,785
Talking to people about options?

697
00:42:44,821 --> 00:42:48,155
About switzerland? About death?

698
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,723
If that's illegal, arrest me.

699
00:42:49,759 --> 00:42:51,792
If you think I'm a criminal,
arrest me.

700
00:42:51,828 --> 00:42:53,794
You don't get to play god, mary.

701
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,629
None of us do.

702
00:42:58,968 --> 00:43:01,368
I don't know
what to tell you, ben.

703
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,972
You got the wrong girl.

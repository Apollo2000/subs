1
00:00:02,016 --> 00:00:03,116
What is this really about?

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,227
Well, we're just trying
to clarify

3
00:00:04,251 --> 00:00:05,891
the circumstances
of your husband's death.

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:07,820
<i>Troy had cancer. He died.</i>

5
00:00:07,855 --> 00:00:09,455
Seems pretty clear to me.

6
00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:12,225
Your client is a primary suspect

7
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:13,426
in a murder investigation.

8
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,427
Define "cooperate."

9
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:15,461
He wears a wire.

10
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:20,933
I think it's
really unprofessional of you

11
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:22,568
to come to a counseling session
high.

12
00:00:22,603 --> 00:00:24,270
Don't go. Please.

13
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:29,175
I can't trust you anymore.

14
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:31,044
I guess I'd say that.

15
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:33,880
Is this your mom's?

16
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:36,115
The best thing to do
when your mom's a drug dealer

17
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,251
is to just pretend
it's not happening.

18
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:42,155
The first time I did this,
I was 16, with my mother.

19
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:44,991
Your mother didn't die
of cancer, did she?

20
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:46,526
I really thought I knew you.

21
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,195
Sid Thomas-Haye, gunshot wound
to the upper thigh.

22
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:51,531
Did you have anything to do
with that guy's disappearance?

23
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:52,532
Yes.

24
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:54,133
I'll take him from here.

25
00:00:54,168 --> 00:00:55,268
Come on, Grady.

26
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:56,335
It's too late.

27
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:06,512
God.

28
00:01:06,547 --> 00:01:07,847
Poor Sid.

29
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:10,717
We are going to get caught,
and I cannot get caught.

30
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:15,555
<i>Remember yesterday,
when I told you to leave</i>

31
00:01:15,589 --> 00:01:18,057
me and my family alone?
I meant it.

32
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:19,959
<i>I want answers about my son.</i>

33
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:21,971
What he needed was someone
to say, "Keep fighting."

34
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:24,040
Instead, he found someone
that said, "You can give up."

35
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:26,966
Well, look who it is,
the Angel of Death.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,501
I want a new partner.

37
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:37,744
<i>Do you think our past
dictates our future?</i>

38
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:39,612
<i>Everything that's happened
in our lives</i>

39
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:41,781
has brought us
to this moment here,

40
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:44,383
you asking me to help you
kill people.

41
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:48,221
That would be the past
dictating the present,

42
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:51,758
and no, I think we have
more control than that.

43
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:56,863
How much do people pay?

44
00:01:56,897 --> 00:01:58,231
$10,000.

45
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:03,236
And Desmond?

46
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,372
Des is out. He's an addict.
I can't rely on him.

47
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:09,208
I want to keep doing this,

48
00:02:09,243 --> 00:02:12,445
so I need a supplier
and I need a partner.

49
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:17,683
Why do you want me
to be your partner?

50
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:21,487
I've come to accept
certain things

51
00:02:21,522 --> 00:02:24,357
about the work I do.

52
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:25,525
It's dangerous.

53
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:32,298
I need protection,
which I think you can provide.

54
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,935
But it's up to you.

55
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:37,904
Uncle Grady?

56
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:43,176
Hey, monkey,
what are you doing out of bed?

57
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,877
I had a bad dream.

58
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:46,145
- Monsters again?
- Yeah.

59
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,180
Hey, come here.

60
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:49,682
I got ya. I got ya.

61
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:52,785
It was really scary and
they were chasing me.

62
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,587
It's okay, baby.

63
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:57,089
There's nothing wrong.

64
00:02:57,124 --> 00:02:59,592
Maya...

65
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:02,628
I'd like you to meet
my friend, Mary.

66
00:03:02,663 --> 00:03:04,330
Hi.

67
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:06,999
Hi.

68
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:09,302
You know what I do
when I have a bad dream?

69
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:14,140
I go right back to sleep,

70
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:17,143
or else the monsters win.

71
00:03:22,783 --> 00:03:24,250
To our future.

72
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:45,004
<i>Dr. Jeffrey, to Admitting.
Dr. Jeffrey, Admitting.</i>

73
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:49,876
Look, I said I was out.

74
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,846
I know, I know.
I respect your decision.

75
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,917
This is for Morgan.

76
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:01,854
He was your patient.

77
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:08,794
He talk about medieval torture?

78
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:11,864
In disturbing detail.

79
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:14,133
Big weirdo.

80
00:04:16,637 --> 00:04:18,437
Well, see ya.

81
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:20,006
Annie, wait.

82
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,375
You just said
you respected my decision.

83
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,710
It's not about that.

84
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:26,846
I have a favor to ask you.

85
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,815
A favor for you is
like the kiss of death.

86
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:33,252
I need you to go to this address

87
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:35,054
and babysit on this guy
for the day,

88
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:36,389
make sure he stays sober.

89
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:39,392
- Not interested.
- I'll pay you.

90
00:04:43,263 --> 00:04:45,235
Look, I know I'm an asshole.

91
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,172
And I've been reckless...

92
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:54,440
but everything I've done
was to try to protect us.

93
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:57,009
And I can fix this,
but I need your help.

94
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,781
Who is he?

95
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:03,382
He's a friend.

96
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:06,152
$50 an hour.

97
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:08,973
You really will be
a millionaire one day, Annie.

98
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:11,012
I know.

99
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:29,942
Hey,

100
00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:32,178
I bet this is one of them
self-melting driveways.

101
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:35,214
Yeah. I bet you should've
been a football player.

102
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:36,849
Yeah.

103
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,491
Mrs. Dixon?

104
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:46,625
What's going on?

105
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,595
We have a warrant
to search the premises.

106
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:56,068
Thank you.

107
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:02,200
Hi.

108
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:05,845
Thank you for meeting me.

109
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,881
I didn't know I had a choice.

110
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:11,550
I want to take you somewhere.

111
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:13,586
You know, you can't just
take me out of class

112
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,622
because you decided to just take
a stab at being a mother today.

113
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:18,657
You know, like, I could
have tests and stuff.

114
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,693
Do you have a test today?

115
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:23,662
- No.
- Okay. Well, then, come on.

116
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:34,874
Come in!

117
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:37,843
Christ.

118
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:47,753
Did I order you?

119
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:50,189
No. Mary did.

120
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:54,493
She hired me to help make sure
that you stay clean.

121
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:57,463
Said you had
somewhere to be later.

122
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:03,869
I-I don't know
if I'm hallucinating or dying,

123
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:06,372
but either way, I like the view.

124
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:07,873
Hello, Angel.

125
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:09,475
It's Annie.

126
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,546
And you look exactly
like I thought you would.

127
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,980
Dashing.

128
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:16,082
Depraved.

129
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:21,420
Okay, that's enough standing.
Come on.

130
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:28,661
Now, sit. Stay.

131
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:32,631
Drink this.
It's a protein shake.

132
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,933
I don't want it.

133
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:36,102
Drink it.

134
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:38,237
Fine.

135
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,339
God, you're so bossy.

136
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:42,308
Force of habit. I'm a nurse.

137
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:47,313
Wait, you're that Annie?

138
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:57,923
I'm calling my lawyer.
This is ridiculous.

139
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,225
I already told you everything.

140
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:00,369
Well, You didn't tell us
that your husband

141
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:03,162
withdrew $10,000
three days before his death.

142
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:06,031
Yeah, that's right,

143
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:08,367
we have access to his
financial records as well.

144
00:08:09,703 --> 00:08:11,637
Maybe you do need
to call your lawyer.

145
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:16,742
You didn't tell us
about this either.

146
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:19,078
I did... I didn't do anything.

147
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:22,882
You withheld information.

148
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,317
I can only think of one reason
why you'd do that.

149
00:08:25,352 --> 00:08:27,820
Because Troy had help
ending his life.

150
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:29,488
You were there.

151
00:08:29,523 --> 00:08:33,192
Yeah, well, I wasn't there.

152
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:35,794
My husband needed me
and I wasn't there.

153
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,936
A few weeks before he died,
he came apart.

154
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:46,505
He said he couldn't
take it anymore.

155
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,346
He wanted it to end.

156
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:51,911
So he asked you to help him die.

157
00:08:54,514 --> 00:09:00,853
And instead of listening
to what he wanted, I got angry.

158
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:04,990
And we had this huge fight.
I told him he was selfish.

159
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:07,359
Why didn't you tell us about it?

160
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:11,363
Because I realized
that he'd found someone

161
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:14,233
to help him do what he wanted,

162
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:16,422
someone to help him die.

163
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:20,172
And I was grateful.

164
00:09:24,578 --> 00:09:27,379
I'm sorry. It's the station.

165
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:29,148
Excuse me.

166
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,284
Wesley.

167
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:34,186
- Prentice here.
- And Hull.

168
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:36,722
<i>- Yeah?
- We found the body.</i>

169
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:38,157
Can you be more specific?

170
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,558
Sid Thomas-Haye.

171
00:09:39,593 --> 00:09:41,327
Guy who escaped
from the hospital.

172
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:44,063
Found him in a Yukon XL,
single shot to the head.

173
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:45,231
Okay, nice work.

174
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:47,433
Not so nice for him,
but could be good for you.

175
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:48,767
We found his phone.

176
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:51,537
A burner cell... clean,
except for one missed call,

177
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:52,972
<i>so we ran that number.</i>

178
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:56,275
Name came up as part
of the Harris investigation.

179
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:57,810
What's the name?

180
00:09:57,844 --> 00:09:59,812
<i>Morgan Lewis.</i>

181
00:10:04,815 --> 00:10:08,596
Got any ideas why this Sid guy and
Morgan might be connected?

182
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,235
Sid had a charge for possession.

183
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,205
Maybe he was Morgan's dealer.

184
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:37,094
We got probable cause.

185
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:39,063
Morgan, you home?

186
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:44,502
Morgan?

187
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:01,385
Frank, I got something.

188
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,038
Yeah? What do you got?

189
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,024
Car service receipt.

190
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:10,661
Looks like Morgan took a cab
to the Larimar Hotel last night.

191
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:12,530
Maybe he got drugs and a hooker.

192
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:14,065
One last hurrah.

193
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,068
I know that look.

194
00:11:17,102 --> 00:11:19,704
He went to meet Mary.

195
00:11:19,738 --> 00:11:21,939
All right, let's go
check out the Larimar.

196
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:32,750
I already told Mary,
that I don't want

197
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:35,219
anything to do
with your business or any of it.

198
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:37,288
Okay, well, you did
at one point.

199
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,056
Mary would never force anyone
into this.

200
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:40,625
Why did you do it
in the first place?

201
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,727
I work in the ICU.

202
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:46,130
I deal with the heaviest shit
in the hospital...

203
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,433
People at their worst,
their most desperate.

204
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:53,771
Before Mary, there was only
so much I could do for them.

205
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:57,375
Handing them that pamphlet,
it gave them...

206
00:11:57,409 --> 00:12:00,177
- Comfort.
- Yeah.

207
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:05,316
Also I want a million dollars.

208
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,984
What?

209
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,653
I have financial goals.

210
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,221
How much do you have so far?

211
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,634
Come on, I'm not gonna rob you.

212
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:13,791
It's too much work.

213
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:15,092
- Not enough.
- Enough for what?

214
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:16,193
Freedom.

215
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:18,129
So you're breaking the law
for freedom?

216
00:12:18,163 --> 00:12:20,097
The law is wrong,
and it will change.

217
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:21,175
Until then, there's no reason

218
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,677
that I shouldn't
supplement my income.

219
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,535
Then why stop?

220
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,605
I have this vision.

221
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,474
Me, Mary, and now you,

222
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:33,611
all of us in the woods
somewhere, like a camp.

223
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:37,048
No, a retreat. A death retreat.

224
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:38,749
People come
from all over the world

225
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:41,786
to experience
the finest death possible,

226
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,287
from the best of the best.

227
00:12:46,358 --> 00:12:47,858
Sounds kind of nice.

228
00:12:58,103 --> 00:13:00,371
Did you bring me here
to stare at the lake?

229
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,006
No, I brought you out here
to understand

230
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,974
why you're so angry with me.

231
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:07,722
You know, you're at the age
I was when my mother

232
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:11,015
was really sick,
right before she died.

233
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:13,117
Before she killed herself?

234
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:15,119
Yeah.

235
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:17,088
It happened right there.

236
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:24,399
I was 16. I was so angry.

237
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,698
I remember feeling like
everything was always about her,

238
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:30,368
you know, she was so consumed
with her own life,

239
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:33,037
her own misery, and Jess,
I don't want you

240
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:35,272
to ever have to feel that way.

241
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:37,274
I want you to know that
you can come to me

242
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,243
about anything
whenever you want.

243
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:45,349
Jess, I can tell you're in pain.
What's going on?

244
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:49,360
It's Naomi.

245
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:52,223
What do you mean?

246
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:55,693
We just have
a complicated relationship.

247
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:05,136
I love her.

248
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:10,107
Like, I mean, like,
I'm in love with her.

249
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,809
Or I thought I was,
I don't know.

250
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:15,513
I thought she...
She loved me too, but sh...

251
00:14:15,547 --> 00:14:17,481
Honey.

252
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:23,521
I'm sure she does love you
in her own way.

253
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:26,424
And if she doesn't,
it's her loss.

254
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,232
I mean, who could not love you?

255
00:14:29,094 --> 00:14:30,628
You're perfect.

256
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:31,662
I am?

257
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:36,167
Jess, you're perfect
in every way.

258
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:43,407
Why did you lie for her?

259
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:47,778
What do you mean?

260
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:49,246
Naomi took the drugs,

261
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:51,882
you know, the drugs you had
in your shed for Casper?

262
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:52,950
She told me, she told me

263
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:54,819
that you lied for her.
Why would you do that?

264
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,555
That wasn't a lie, that was
doctor/patient confidentiality.

265
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:59,623
- She didn't...
- No, that's bullshit.

266
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:01,369
A mom would tell another mom
something like that.

267
00:15:01,393 --> 00:15:03,961
Just please tell me the truth.

268
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,064
Okay.

269
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:08,828
Okay, I was scared.

270
00:15:09,568 --> 00:15:12,036
I was scared if your dad
and Louise found out

271
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,581
that I had left that stuff
lying around,

272
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:16,540
I could lose you and Cambie.

273
00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:19,243
That could happen?

274
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:20,678
Yes.

275
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,247
That's why I didn't tell anyone.

276
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:27,451
But Jess, I can, and I will

277
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:30,321
if it would make
your life easier.

278
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,160
I thought you were lying
because you were a drug dealer.

279
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:42,166
Honey, I'm not a drug dealer.

280
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,235
I know.

281
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:49,974
That must have been really hard
growing up without a mother.

282
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,177
Like, with all your flaws still,

283
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:57,248
I couldn't imagine
life without you, so.

284
00:15:58,683 --> 00:16:00,004
Well, you don't have to.

285
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:06,457
Mr. Lewis did request
a late check out, but...

286
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:07,658
It's urgent.

287
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:09,417
Since he's not answering
the hotel phone,

288
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:11,362
- I can let you in.
- Actually,

289
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,673
- we should probably go in alone.
- Yeah.

290
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:14,665
- Room 214.
- Thank you.

291
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:30,481
Shit.

292
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,449
What do you think?

293
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:39,249
I think Mary finally figured out

294
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:40,891
a way to kill Morgan.

295
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,800
Holy shit.

296
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:51,936
You got more and more beautiful
since I last saw you.

297
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,371
How do you do that?
What is your secret?

298
00:16:54,406 --> 00:16:56,040
It's youth.

299
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:57,975
And she's clever too.

300
00:16:58,009 --> 00:16:59,877
I haven't seen you forever.

301
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:01,745
Mom, can I stay for a bit?

302
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,847
Yeah, if it's okay with Nicole.

303
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:05,382
I'm gonna put you to work

304
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:07,318
if you're gonna stay,
so get changed,

305
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:08,930
and there's an extra pair
of gloves by the door.

306
00:17:08,954 --> 00:17:10,888
Okay.

307
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:14,692
Don't dig too deep, okay?

308
00:17:14,726 --> 00:17:17,895
Why? Is this where you're
hiding all the bodies?

309
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:19,263
Kind of.

310
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:25,069
Remember when Mom had
that problem

311
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:27,571
with the morning glories?

312
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:29,974
Yeah, she was obsessed.

313
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,976
I mean, they're beautiful,
but she said

314
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,447
there was too much of them,
too much beauty.

315
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,749
Yeah. If you don't control them,

316
00:17:38,783 --> 00:17:40,384
they end up taking over
the whole garden,

317
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:42,953
strangling all the other plants.

318
00:17:42,988 --> 00:17:45,456
So you have two options.

319
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,935
You can either
pull them all out, start fresh,

320
00:17:50,562 --> 00:17:52,963
or you can ride the chaos.

321
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,402
So which is it for you, Mary?

322
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:01,739
If anything ever happened to me,

323
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:04,274
you'd take care of them, right?

324
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:14,962
Normally I'm not usually happy
to see to see a dead man

325
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:17,922
but I'm happy, I really am.
Finally got a body.

326
00:18:17,957 --> 00:18:20,492
Yeah. Well, if pento
shows up in the autopsy,

327
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:22,127
then it's over, right?

328
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:24,306
She basically
handed us the case.

329
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:27,327
We rattled her with the wire,
she slipped up.

330
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:33,266
Frank Gaines.

331
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,235
Mr. Bennett. How can I help you?

332
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:40,239
Okay. Meet me at the station.

333
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:44,811
Desmond Bennett wants to make
a statement.

334
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:46,613
Probably wants to make a deal.

335
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:49,983
Can't wait to wipe that smug
British grin off his face.

336
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:52,285
Cool. I'll wait for forensics.

337
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,559
- Yeah?
- Yeah, and then I'll go

338
00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:55,622
arrest our girl.

339
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:57,624
All right.

340
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,564
My patients... Morgan Lewis,
Ethan Grant, Troy Dixon.

341
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:13,940
What's this?

342
00:19:13,974 --> 00:19:17,944
That's a video statement.
Each patient has one.

343
00:19:17,978 --> 00:19:21,581
Is physical evidence
really a good idea?

344
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:24,550
We decided we needed
an insurance policy.

345
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:26,986
In case we ever got caught,
we have a legal contract

346
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:30,289
and statement that proves
the patient gave consent.

347
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:32,166
You think this is gonna
hold up in court?

348
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:35,322
I hope I never have to find out.

349
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:40,199
How do we find our patients?

350
00:19:40,234 --> 00:19:41,668
They come to us.

351
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:43,936
Well, we're gonna have to do
something about that,

352
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:45,772
maybe hire some death dealers.

353
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:47,006
I'm not soliciting death.

354
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,941
You should be.

355
00:19:48,976 --> 00:19:50,910
What else?

356
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:04,490
Now we practice injections.

357
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:07,493
Hold your arm out.

358
00:20:07,528 --> 00:20:09,429
You're a funny girl.

359
00:20:09,463 --> 00:20:12,865
Relax, it's saline.

360
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,010
I think you misunderstand
the nature

361
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:15,401
of our relationship here, Mary.

362
00:20:15,436 --> 00:20:18,371
I provide the supplies,
you provide the service.

363
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:24,477
If we're gonna be partners,
we need to share the risk.

364
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:27,013
Same deal I had with Des.

365
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:29,348
So you need to know
how to do this.

366
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:31,984
I know how to do it.

367
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:33,653
Properly.

368
00:20:33,687 --> 00:20:35,621
Like a doctor.

369
00:20:38,258 --> 00:20:40,193
How about if I inject you?

370
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:45,364
Whole purpose is
for me to show you.

371
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:50,236
You can talk me through it.

372
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:16,162
First, you have to find
a good vein.

373
00:21:16,196 --> 00:21:19,298
Press up and down gently.

374
00:21:23,604 --> 00:21:27,540
This will expand the vein
and make it easier to see.

375
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:30,752
Just like people.

376
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:35,067
You apply enough pressure and
they show what they really are.

377
00:21:37,351 --> 00:21:38,778
Now take the syringe.

378
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:46,058
Insert the needle.

379
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:59,338
Pull back slightly
to show a bit of blood.

380
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:02,742
That's good.

381
00:22:02,776 --> 00:22:05,044
You want a slow
and steady release.

382
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:08,014
Too fast, you'll send the body
into shock.

383
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,465
You always remember
your first time, right?

384
00:22:29,536 --> 00:22:32,004
We should celebrate...

385
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,340
our partnership.

386
00:22:34,374 --> 00:22:36,309
Want a drink?

387
00:22:41,315 --> 00:22:43,149
Can I use your bathroom?

388
00:22:43,183 --> 00:22:45,117
Yeah, just down the hall.

389
00:23:17,618 --> 00:23:19,447
Let me get this straight.

390
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:23,055
Your dealer is
behind this whole thing.

391
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,523
That's right. Grady Burgess.

392
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:25,892
Because you owe him money.

393
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:30,630
All of a sudden you had to get
this off your chest?

394
00:23:30,664 --> 00:23:33,399
To be honest, it wasn't
really my idea.

395
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:35,868
After yesterday, Mary found out
that I was using again,

396
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,638
and she hired a private nurse
to come to my house

397
00:23:38,672 --> 00:23:40,640
and make sure I stayed clean.

398
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:41,874
Nice friend.

399
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:43,509
She demanded...

400
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:46,379
That I come down here and
I-I tell you the truth.

401
00:23:46,413 --> 00:23:48,775
And what is the truth, Desmond?

402
00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:02,361
Mary. Mary, I was
just about to call you...

403
00:24:02,396 --> 00:24:04,163
<i>I'm in trouble.</i>

404
00:24:04,197 --> 00:24:05,564
What... what do you mean?

405
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,168
Grady Burgess, Des's dealer.

406
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:13,639
I came to see to him
to tell him to leave Des alone.

407
00:24:13,674 --> 00:24:15,675
<i>Help me, please. He drugged me.</i>

408
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:17,777
He's going to kill me.

409
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:19,779
Okay, stay on the line, okay?
Keep talking to me.

410
00:24:19,813 --> 00:24:21,113
Where are you?

411
00:24:21,148 --> 00:24:26,085
<i>1287 Monu-ment... Monument.</i>

412
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:29,455
<i>Mary?</i>

413
00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:31,290
Mary?

414
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:33,292
Shit.

415
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:41,309
<i>So you're saying Mary had...
nothing to do with this.</i>

416
00:24:41,325 --> 00:24:43,460
That's right.

417
00:24:43,494 --> 00:24:46,396
The truth is, I couldn't pay
my drug debt

418
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:49,032
because of the whole
lost license ordeal.

419
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:51,101
Grady knew about my work
with the terminally ill.

420
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:53,303
He said that if I gave him
our client list

421
00:24:53,337 --> 00:24:55,638
that he'd forgive me my debt,
which I did,

422
00:24:55,673 --> 00:24:58,742
which was... stupid.

423
00:25:00,478 --> 00:25:02,378
Go to Grady's house.

424
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:03,913
You'll find a vault
full of drugs,

425
00:25:03,948 --> 00:25:06,583
including pentobarbital.

426
00:25:10,988 --> 00:25:13,056
You like scotch?

427
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,191
I do.

428
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,631
Here.

429
00:25:24,335 --> 00:25:26,269
Cheers.

430
00:25:33,511 --> 00:25:37,180
We're both healers, you and me.

431
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:39,452
We help people end
their suffering.

432
00:25:40,618 --> 00:25:45,722
Give them a moment of euphoria
and take away their pain.

433
00:26:06,076 --> 00:26:08,178
I thought he just wanted
to sell them pain relief,

434
00:26:08,212 --> 00:26:11,614
you know? Weed, morphine.

435
00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:13,616
I guess he saw an opportunity.

436
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:15,018
To kill people?

437
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,655
Must be
an entrepreneurial genius.

438
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:21,658
Well, if you think about it,
he... he is.

439
00:26:21,692 --> 00:26:23,459
I mean, apparently,
people are willing to pay

440
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:26,563
top dollar for a good death.

441
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:29,140
You know, it's true,
what you said.

442
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:33,303
You never forget
your first injection.

443
00:26:33,337 --> 00:26:38,341
Mine was Yvonne.

444
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:39,909
You know what that is?

445
00:26:39,944 --> 00:26:42,879
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

446
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:47,016
You shouldn't underestimate me,
Mary.

447
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,555
Yet you didn't... you didn't
think to mention any of this

448
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,324
when we were
in this very room together.

449
00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:57,727
Okay, you see, the way
I saw it, I had two options.

450
00:26:57,761 --> 00:27:02,031
One was to tell the police...
tell you that I'm a drug addict.

451
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:04,534
Two, wear the wire,
and I could prove that

452
00:27:04,568 --> 00:27:07,971
Mary and I are just ordinary
end-of-life counselors.

453
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:10,264
You lose all control,

454
00:27:11,475 --> 00:27:14,553
limb by limb, organ by organ...

455
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:18,655
until you can't breathe.

456
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,517
Is that where you come in?

457
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:23,365
To take back control?

458
00:27:25,046 --> 00:27:27,365
Or else the monster wins.

459
00:27:33,364 --> 00:27:35,177
You said that was saline.

460
00:27:37,268 --> 00:27:38,482
It was.

461
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:46,109
You're a smart man, Detective,
smarter man than I.

462
00:27:46,143 --> 00:27:48,111
Why do you think you have
nothing on us?

463
00:27:48,145 --> 00:27:50,179
Because there's nothing
to be had.

464
00:27:59,757 --> 00:28:01,976
When I killed Sid...

465
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:06,462
I looked him in the eye
and I told him

466
00:28:06,497 --> 00:28:08,554
that he was going to die.

467
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:12,110
So just tell me the truth.

468
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,572
You do realize that we can
still charge you for accessory.

469
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:18,574
Confessing won't change that.

470
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:22,946
I'm prepared to accept
whatever the punishment may be.

471
00:28:24,148 --> 00:28:27,850
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead.

472
00:28:27,885 --> 00:28:30,653
Tell me there was pento
in the needle.

473
00:28:32,723 --> 00:28:34,924
There was.

474
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:37,360
Watered down pento.

475
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,501
I don't understand
the game, Mary.

476
00:28:47,838 --> 00:28:49,305
The only crime
that Mary's guilty of

477
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,376
is trying to protect me.
Save me, really.

478
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,545
She can't help herself.

479
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:57,647
It's just what she does.

480
00:29:05,022 --> 00:29:08,019
We're not the same, you and I.

481
00:29:09,293 --> 00:29:12,113
You sell drugs to addicts.

482
00:29:12,896 --> 00:29:15,832
You murdered Sid.

483
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:18,868
You came after my daughter!

484
00:29:18,902 --> 00:29:21,871
You're not a healer.
You create pain.

485
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:27,815
I don't like games, Mary.

486
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,613
Police! Put the weapon down!

487
00:29:34,418 --> 00:29:36,219
Mary, you okay?

488
00:29:36,253 --> 00:29:38,388
Mary?

489
00:29:38,422 --> 00:29:40,656
I need something
to stop the bleeding.

490
00:29:40,691 --> 00:29:42,258
Here.

491
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:44,727
You okay?

492
00:29:44,762 --> 00:29:46,429
I'll call the ambulance, okay?

493
00:29:46,463 --> 00:29:48,531
Mary.

494
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:55,081
- Yeah, hey, this is Detective Ben Wesley.
- Help me. Help me.

495
00:29:55,106 --> 00:29:57,840
I need an ambulance
to 1287 Monument Drive.

496
00:29:57,875 --> 00:30:01,177
Yeah, male, 40s,
gunshot wound to the chest.

497
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:04,814
Help me. Help me. Help me.

498
00:30:06,817 --> 00:30:11,320
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

499
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:44,554
And then he pinned me down
and shot me with pento.

500
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:48,491
And I really thought,
"This is it."

501
00:30:48,525 --> 00:30:52,028
And it's true, you know,
that cliché?

502
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:56,365
Your life really does
flash before your eyes.

503
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,967
And then you were there.

504
00:31:00,637 --> 00:31:02,505
Look, we can take it from here.

505
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:04,474
We'll get the results back
shortly.

506
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:06,442
Okay.

507
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,081
I'm glad you're okay.

508
00:31:12,116 --> 00:31:13,695
Am I okay, Ben?

509
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:17,587
Ma'am. I'm here
to take you home.

510
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:20,323
Yeah, wait, you sure you don't
need to go to a hospital?

511
00:31:20,357 --> 00:31:22,191
I'm sure.

512
00:31:22,226 --> 00:31:24,182
I'm a doctor, remember?

513
00:31:25,062 --> 00:31:26,408
Yeah.

514
00:31:37,941 --> 00:31:39,475
Grady's gun is a 9-mil,

515
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,477
same as the bullet we found
in Sid Thomas-Haye.

516
00:31:41,512 --> 00:31:43,646
Yeah, we're gonna have
ballistics compare.

517
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,615
Okay, good.

518
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:51,220
I think we just solved a murder.

519
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:26,542
The sun is in our eyes
and in our hearts

520
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:29,412
even when it's night
and when it's dark.

521
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:32,415
The moon still glows,
the stars still shine,

522
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:35,518
Now and forever
until the end of time.

523
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:38,020
What do you think?

524
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:40,156
I think you need to dig deeper.

525
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,157
What does that mean?

526
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:42,191
I can't tell you that.

527
00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:44,493
It's just, like,
part of the journey.

528
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:46,062
You look pretty, Mama.

529
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:48,330
Thank you, baby.

530
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:50,066
I'm gonna go get my notebook,
okay?

531
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,067
I wrote more poems.

532
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:53,836
That's great.

533
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,205
So, keep an eye
on Jess and Naomi,

534
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:59,608
shut down any fist fights,
and...

535
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:01,644
Yeah, I shouldn't be too late.

536
00:33:01,678 --> 00:33:04,013
So are you still in business?

537
00:33:06,116 --> 00:33:08,818
As a doctor, I remain
a member of society

538
00:33:08,852 --> 00:33:12,688
with a special obligation to all
of my fellow human beings.

539
00:33:12,722 --> 00:33:15,162
I don't think you have to be
a doctor to have that obligation.

540
00:33:18,395 --> 00:33:19,361
What do you mean?

541
00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:21,091
I want in.

542
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:23,911
We could be partners.

543
00:33:26,903 --> 00:33:28,771
I already have a partner.

544
00:33:28,805 --> 00:33:30,739
Well, then I'll be
your receptionist.

545
00:33:30,774 --> 00:33:32,575
It doesn't work like that.

546
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:35,711
Mary, I need a career change,

547
00:33:35,745 --> 00:33:39,115
and we'd make a great team.

548
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:41,717
Let's talk about this later,
shall we?

549
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:43,686
You need me.

550
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:47,857
I love you.

551
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:49,875
I love you.

552
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:53,229
Hey, where are you going,
anyway?

553
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:55,197
A funeral.

554
00:34:09,312 --> 00:34:11,413
Think it's good for him
to watch that video.

555
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:15,151
I mean, it's... worth more
than a conviction, right?

556
00:34:17,053 --> 00:34:19,188
Grady Burgess had
the patients' videos,

557
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:21,991
the files, the pento,
the whole operation.

558
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:24,460
We have enough evidence
to close off all three cases.

559
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:31,267
We seized $1.2 million in drugs
from Burgess's place.

560
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:32,501
Thought the chief was gonna

561
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:34,203
plant a big wet one on me.

562
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:36,805
Yeah, hopefully got Des
on the accessory charge,

563
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,440
so that's good.

564
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:40,910
If it all works out.

565
00:34:40,944 --> 00:34:43,245
You know, put his ass
in jail for a while.

566
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,282
Although his lawyer did
request our files.

567
00:34:46,316 --> 00:34:50,920
As for Mary, she'll be crazy
to counsel anyone ever again.

568
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:53,923
Yeah. Yeah, she would be crazy.

569
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:02,631
<i>I don't know if anyone's
ever gonna see this,</i>

570
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:06,412
<i>but I, Ethan Grant,
choose to take my life.</i>

571
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:10,811
<i>Can I say more?</i>

572
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:14,510
<i>Can I say why?</i>

573
00:35:17,147 --> 00:35:19,048
<i>I want my family to know,</i>

574
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:24,053
<i>there's nothing that I would've
done differently, so please,</i>

575
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:28,958
<i>forget about the trials...
and the treatments and...</i>

576
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:31,694
<i>And that one more year
that I didn't get.</i>

577
00:35:31,728 --> 00:35:36,238
<i>Just... just know that...
That I love you all.</i>

578
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:40,502
<i>I have no regrets.</i>

579
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:54,783
Are you ever gonna
talk to me again?

580
00:35:54,818 --> 00:35:56,689
Talking to you right now.

581
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:01,190
I didn't mean to start
a fight with you, Jess.

582
00:36:01,224 --> 00:36:04,593
I didn't mean for any of it.
I just thought we were...

583
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:07,329
experimenting, or whatever.

584
00:36:07,364 --> 00:36:09,798
I guess it started
that way, but...

585
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,067
I thought it was more than that.

586
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:19,742
Well, it... wasn't... for me.

587
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:21,443
And that maybe sounds
bitchy or something,

588
00:36:21,478 --> 00:36:23,445
but I'm just being honest.

589
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,917
Well, I honestly think that

590
00:36:28,952 --> 00:36:30,753
you're a train wreck.

591
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,527
Hi.

592
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:47,233
Hey.

593
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:49,803
You look nice.

594
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:52,255
Thank you.

595
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:55,498
I'm glad you called.

596
00:36:56,313 --> 00:36:58,414
Yeah.

597
00:36:58,448 --> 00:37:02,418
Um, I called to give you...

598
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:04,386
this.

599
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:13,228
Found it... Grady's, yeah.

600
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:18,967
He asked me to take my shirt off
to see if I was wearing a wire,

601
00:37:19,002 --> 00:37:23,572
and the mouse ears,
I don't know.

602
00:37:23,606 --> 00:37:25,974
You don't have to do that
anymore.

603
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:27,810
Case is closed.

604
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:41,957
<i>Okay, so how does it work,
the dying part?</i>

605
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:43,859
<i>Well, in Switzerland,
a doctor would give</i>

606
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:47,763
<i>a patient such as yourself
a lethal dose...</i>

607
00:37:47,797 --> 00:37:49,198
<i>- My God.
- Of sodium pentobarbital</i>

608
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:51,533
<i>with a drink.</i>

609
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:55,671
<i>There is no pain, no suffering,
you just fall asleep.</i>

610
00:37:55,705 --> 00:37:58,674
<i>An option is
to go to Switzerland</i>

611
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:01,677
<i>and be what they call
a death tourist, and fly...</i>

612
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:03,379
So?

613
00:38:03,413 --> 00:38:06,081
Did you ever find out
if your mom was a drug dealer?

614
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:07,816
Yeah, she's like a kingpin.

615
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:08,917
She has a whole empire.

616
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:12,221
You're such an idiot.

617
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:16,358
Hey. Who's cat is that?

618
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,399
It's Casper.

619
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:33,008
I gotta go out of town,
for another job.

620
00:38:35,812 --> 00:38:37,579
How long will you be gone?

621
00:38:37,614 --> 00:38:39,145
Maybe a few months.

622
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:43,285
And who will you be this time?

623
00:38:45,655 --> 00:38:47,293
Hard to say.

624
00:38:48,591 --> 00:38:51,026
You love it, don't you?

625
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,461
What?

626
00:38:52,495 --> 00:38:55,063
The thrill of a new case.

627
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:18,387
I'll see you around.

628
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,863
Don't fall for your target.

629
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,538
What are you watching?

630
00:39:36,573 --> 00:39:38,140
Ooh. Porn?

631
00:39:38,174 --> 00:39:41,477
No, it's just something
for this case.

632
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,814
I'll get it out of you.

633
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:50,352
Right.

634
00:40:22,385 --> 00:40:24,052
You're late.

635
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:26,255
Yeah, I had to meet someone first.

636
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:29,825
Someone tall, ruggedly handsome,

637
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:31,493
carries a gun?

638
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:33,362
Keep your enemies close.

639
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:36,422
Yeah, I'll bet
you kept him close.

640
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:39,635
Duly and diligently.

641
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:43,505
Hey. I'm glad you guys
could make it.

642
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,640
Wouldn't miss it.

643
00:40:44,674 --> 00:40:48,010
Morgan was one
of our favorite clients.

644
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:52,014
Yeah. You know,
the day we met at his place

645
00:40:52,048 --> 00:40:54,049
was the day he died.

646
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:57,519
Yeah, we heard that.

647
00:40:59,055 --> 00:41:00,956
Sorry he had to go
through it alone, you know?

648
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,258
He wasn't alone.

649
00:41:04,527 --> 00:41:06,728
Well, no man is an island.

650
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:09,164
We are all... connected.

651
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:13,402
Right.

652
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:17,172
This should be a good show.

653
00:41:17,206 --> 00:41:19,775
Yeah, it's just like Morgan,
going out with style.

654
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:26,782
S-s-so, Annie was a doll.

655
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:29,651
Glad you two had fun.

656
00:41:29,686 --> 00:41:31,820
We had some interesting
conversations.

657
00:41:31,854 --> 00:41:32,888
Yeah?

658
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:35,290
About the business model.

659
00:41:35,325 --> 00:41:36,725
What we've been doing
right, wrong,

660
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:39,261
how to expand,
where to get more pento.

661
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:42,097
I had a feeling you'd get her
back onside.

662
00:41:42,131 --> 00:41:43,765
I can be very convincing.

663
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:11,426
I love funerals.

664
00:42:12,562 --> 00:42:14,039
Nothing like staring death
in the face

665
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:16,598
to make you feel alive.

666
00:42:26,776 --> 00:42:30,012
<i>Watch the Series Premiere of The Blacklist
Redemption, Thursday on Global.</i>

667
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:33,515
Scottie Hargrave is in charge of
a global intelligence

668
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,350
gathering operation.

669
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,753
You should know,
I have anger issues.

670
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:39,321
Hey. Hey. Hey.

671
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,355
Take it easy.

672
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:41,923
You're hired.

673
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:43,158
You want me to work for you?

674
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,894
We could do
incredible things together.

675
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:51,133
You really know how to
push my buttons.

676
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,004
Welcome to the family.

677

00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,907
‐ Stop that. Stop.
Stop, that hurts Mama. Stop that.

3
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,326
Jack, stop. Stop! Stop, Jack.

4
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,121
Jack, stop. Stop.

5
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,290
I said no! Come here.

6
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,585
Get in the bath now! Jack!

7
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,787
That's it.

8
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,915
Lay back. Lay back. There you go.

9
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,024
We're going in the house, yeah.

10
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,734
I got another one of those late notices.

11
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,987
Mama!
Well, then, you'd better check
your record books,

12
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,196
'cause I know I sent it over there.

13
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,073
Mama!
Under "Bev."

14
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,367
Same address... Shit.
Mama!

15
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,743
Mama!
What?

16
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,187
‐ Can I have Dorothy braids?

17
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,207
‐ Eat your breakfast.

18
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,251
Police
are still searching for a missing girl

19
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,838
- who was abducted from her home...
- What's them abducted for?

20
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:57,922
‐ Them what?

21
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,676
...fear is
a deadly attack in south Louisiana.

22
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,243
Come on with that trash.

23
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,057
Remember our conversation?
Yeah.

24
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,518
Yeah, what'd I say?
No scissors.

25
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,003
‐ That's right. No scissors.
That's good, baby.

26
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,255
Come on.

27
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:17,942
Come on.

28
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,564
Come on. Go, go, go, go.

29
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,085
Hey. Sorry we're late.

30
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,922
‐ Oh, hey, y'all. That's all right.
‐ Jack ain't feeling so good.

31
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,633
‐ Oh, it ain't serious?
'Cause Beau catches every damn thing.

32
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,843
‐ Oh, no, no. Somethin' she ate.

33
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,285
Just a stomach thing.

34
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,972
Child, baby. Look at them braids.

35
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,791
‐ Hey! Hey. She's just playing sweet.

36
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,145
What do you say to Miss Denise?
Thank you.

37
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,980
‐ You're welcome, baby.

38
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,465
‐ Go on over there and play. Go.

39
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,239
‐ Look, uh‐‐
‐ How's Beau doing?

40
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,573
I talked to my husband.
Oh‐‐

41
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:09,601
‐ Yeah, I talked to Derek.
I'm real sorry, but he's got his concerns.

42
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,668
‐ Concerns about what?

43
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,837
‐ Come on, Toni.
You know what about.

44
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,880
I just asked a question.
We just think it better

45
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,757
if Jack goes some other place
nicer than here.

46
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,385
‐ And where am I gonna get the cash
for some place nice? Rob a bank?

47
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,451
‐ That ain't my deal.

48
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,139
There's a daycare on the island.
Jesus. It's...

49
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,933
Kidz Corner.
Kidz Corner?

50
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:32,893
‐ What?

51
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,894
‐ You know I can't afford to‐‐ ‐ You
know this was only supposed to be temporary

52
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,230
after Bev. I ain't runnin' a charity.
I can't barely afford‐‐ No, I know.

53
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,648
I know.

54
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,317
She can stay till Friday.

55
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,944
‐ All right.

56
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,012
I'm real sorry.
I said all right.

57
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,687
Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

58
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,964
Jack got some sort of stomach thing.
I don't know.

59
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,236
Gee. Thanks for caring.

60
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,779
‐ She okay?

61
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,555
‐ Oh, fuck off.

62
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,369
He drunk?
Maybe.

63
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,121
Maybe dead.

64
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,607
‐ Hey, can I get the four‐tops today?
I gotta get some cash coming in.

65
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,586
‐ You gotta do Lee.

66
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,406
‐ Oh, come on.

67
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,778
‐ On, uh, two.

68
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,990
Is there a hotel here?

69
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:29,907
Huh.

70
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,013
‐ What's that?

71
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,640
‐ Ain't a real hotel town.

72
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,433
‐ Well, a motel, then.

73
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,002
‐ Motel took over by them offshore boys.

74
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,924
‐ Where do you sleep?

75
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,386
‐ Sorry?

76
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,284
‐ If there's no hotel
and the motel is occupied, then,

77
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,660
where do you sleep?

78
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,412
‐ Sleep at my house.

79
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,581
‐ Well, where is that?

80
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,565
‐ It's out a‐ways.

81
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,943
$4.26.

82
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,467
There's a diner.

83
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,095
Should be open if you're
looking for a hot meal.

84
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,039
Ain't no good, but it'll be hot.

85
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:25,732
Police are still
searching for 15‐year‐old Chrystina Harris,

86
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,485
a freshman at local
Grand Isle Central High.

87
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,487
‐ Got another one off the island.

88
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,614
‐ Got another one what?

89
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:36,284
Others fear this may
be another in a deadly string of attacks

90
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,077
by the south Louisiana killer

91
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,206
whom authorities have nicknamed
The Blind Butcher.

92
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,316
Why do they call him that?
'Cause that's how he leaves the victims.

93
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,003
‐ How?

94
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,363
Like burger meat.

95
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,034
‐ Oh.

96
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,142
Well, fuck, Janine.

97
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,001
Just let it drown.

98
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,142
Are you my daddy?

99
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,020
Hey, hey. Sorry about that.

100
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,941
Hi.

101
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,568
‐ Hi.

102
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,363
‐ Come on in.

103
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,226
Blow 'em out.

104
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,228
Ooh, yay!

105
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,005
I'm gonna go get a knife.

106
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,160
Uh...
Squirt gun.

107
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:01,870
‐ I thought it was a boy.

108
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:05,165
‐ What? Oh, no, she‐‐ She loves it.

109
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,899
She likes everything to play with.

110
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,712
She ain't picky or nothing.
Here you go.

111
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:11,963
‐ So how is your‐‐
‐ I couldn't believe‐‐.

112
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,673
‐ Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.
‐ Oh, no, I, I‐‐.

113
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,908
You go ahead.

114
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,203
‐ I said, uh, how's your grandma?

115
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,432
‐ Oh, uh...

116
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,832
‐ Her died.

117
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,603
Oh.
Yeah.

118
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,713
She passed last January.
Heart gave out.

119
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,050
Hope you like vanilla.

120
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,488
‐ So you need money?

121
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:37,697
‐ What?

122
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,491
'Cause I‐‐ things is kind of tight.
No, no, I‐‐ Oh, no.

123
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:42,955
They're always working us for cheap, and
you‐‐ - No, no, no. Jack‐‐ I just thought‐‐.

124
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,771
Jack's been asking about you, so...

125
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,817
Oh, scared, huh? Afraid, huh?

126
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,588
How long can you stay fresh in that can?

127
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,178
Come on, get up and fight,
you shivering junkyard!

128
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,972
Put your hands up,
you lopsided bag of hay!

129
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,391
Now, that's getting personal, Lion.

130
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,852
Yes. Get up and teach him a lesson.

131
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,438
Well, what's wrong with you teaching him?

132
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,148
Well, well, well, I hardly know him.

133
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,444
Well, I'll get you anyway, pee‐wee.

134
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,581
Shame on you!

135
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,042
What did you do that for?

136
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,878
I didn't bite him!
Jack, time to make doe‐doe.

137
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,296
‐ Mm‐mm.

138
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,382
‐ Don't be a pest. I said bed.

139
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,968
‐ I gotta get a bath first.

140
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,827
I always do.

141
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,722
Is my nose bleeding?

142
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,186
Well, of course not.

143
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,294
Jack? Jack, what is it?

144
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:15,920
‐ She just kept moving around.
‐ It burns!

145
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,339
Oh, hey. Hey, it's okay.

146
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,948
It's okay. Here we go.

147
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,181
Hey. Stop. What the hell?

148
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,599
Jack, stop.
Stop that.

149
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:30,351
Stop that, Jack.
Stop that. Stop! I said stop!

150
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,519
Ow!

151
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,271
Hey, get off of her!

152
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,245
Jack.

153
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,623
Jack. Jack.

154
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,751
Jack.

155
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,504
Jack. Jack.

156
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:17,339
Jack.

157
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,509
Jack.

158
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:22,886
Jack. Come on.

159
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,186
Jack. Jack.

160
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,522
Jack, you're okay.

161
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,900
Jack.

162
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,838
Okay.

163
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:43,842
Okay. You're good.
You're good. You're good. Yeah.

164
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,951
You're good. You're good.

165
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,847
You okay?

166
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,831
Okay. Yeah.

167
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,919
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

168
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:25,592
‐ Hey, uh, could Ramona watch Jack
a couple of days next week?

169
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,802
Just short‐term?
Eh, I don't think so.

170
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,180
‐ Come on. She don't got a job or nothin'.

171
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,432
‐ She's chasing after three grandbabies.

172
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,249
That's employment enough.

173
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:38,188
‐ What?

174
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,772
‐ You got a table.

175
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,683
‐ What can I get ya?

176
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,520
‐ What's good?

177
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,522
‐ Nothin'.

178
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,399
‐ They pay you to say that.

179
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,778
‐ Got zero strength to bullshit.

180
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,539
‐ I'll have a hamburger.

181
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,595
‐ You want one burger or twenty?

182
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,950
‐ Sit down and have a conversation.

183
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:34,476
‐ Yeah, I know all about conversation.

184
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,647
‐ This one's talk only.

185
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,834
‐ My foot.

186
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,158
‐ So, Toni,

187
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:14,868
how long have you worked here?

188
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,578
‐ Mm‐mm.

189
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,622
You want conversation,
you gotta make talk.

190
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,107
‐ All right. Um...

191
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,128
My name is Alex.

192
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,880
‐ Where you from, Alex?

193
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,655
‐ Uh, nearby.

194
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,343
‐ You lyin' already.

195
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,286
‐ Why do you assume that I'm lying?

196
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,144
‐ 'Cause you ain't talkin' flat.

197
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,396
Folks around here sound like
they fired the letter G

198
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,130
from working the damn alphabet.

199
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,779
I'm here doing a job.
Offshore?

200
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:52,822
‐ Mm‐hmm.

201
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,158
‐ Then you better heal up
and get a straight story.

202
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,035
'Cause trouble don't make pay day.

203
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,060
‐ Well...

204
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,789
I'm no trouble.

205
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,708
‐ Yeah, and I'm the Queen of Sheba.

206
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:07,712
‐ If I was trouble,
then why aren't you afraid of me?

207
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,489
Maybe I got a death wish.

208
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,134
‐ Is that so?

209
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:16,221
‐ Maybe. Maybe I ain't scared of bullshit.

210
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:18,038
'Cause you're chock full.

211
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,292
‐ I like you.

212
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,215
You want something from me.
What's that?

213
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,219
‐ Don't know yet.

214
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:34,972
‐ Huh.

215
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,059
Are you even old enough to smoke?

216
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,205
‐ Old enough for lots.

217
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,207
But we ain't talkin' about me.

218
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,440
‐ Mm‐mm.

219
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,715
How about a game?

220
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,659
If you could be anybody else
in the world...

221
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,473
Who would you be?

222
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,809
Life don't work like that.

223
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,128
Oh, yeah? So how does life work?

224
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,631
‐ I see it like this.

225
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,235
When you're born,

226
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,529
when you a little baby?
Mm‐hmm?

227
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,930
‐ There's a million yous you could be.

228
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,493
Doctor, lawyer, bank robber,
happy, sad‐‐.

229
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,644
All different kinds of versions of you.

230
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,207
And then you start going through life,

231
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,042
and you make this choice...

232
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,378
This one, that one.

233
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:33,548
And one by one,
those versions sort of go off,

234
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:36,408
like, they die in a sort of way.

235
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:41,663
And then finally, you end up who you is.

236
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,167
The end.

237
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,630
‐ You really think that?

238
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,549
‐ Maybe.

239
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,011
Maybe I'm just trying to make
a hundred bucks.

240
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,223
‐ Do you live around here?

241
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,518
There it is.
Well...

242
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,235
Jesus fucking Christ!

243
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,671
What the hell's the matter?

244
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,049
‐ Jack! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Baby, what is it?

245
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,367
Are you hurt? You get hit?
What the hell happened?

246
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,369
Hey! Denise!

247
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,789
Hey, I'm talking to you!
What happened?

248
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,583
‐ Your daughter's a damn psycho,
is what happened.

249
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,062
Fuck you.
Fuck me. Really?

250
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,022
Yeah, fuck you!
Really? You wanna say "fuck you" to me,

251
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,649
after all‐‐ I was watching her.
You were supposed to be watching her.

252
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,567
Well, then, what happened, 'cause she
covered in about a bucket of blood.

253
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,343
‐ She bit the mailman.

254
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,072
Yeah. With her teeth.

255
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,908
Bit into him.
Latched, like a fuckin' dog would do it.

256
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,785
‐ Well, then, what'd he do to her?
He must have hurt her.

257
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,870
‐ He put the mail in the wrong
fucking slot. I don't know.

258
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,872
He just shown up
and she went ballistic on him.

259
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,458
He must have done something. What'd he do?
Come on, Toni. Wake up.

260
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:52,502
The other day she threatened Beau
with the scissors.
What?

261
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,045
‐ He could have gotten seriously hurt.

262
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:55,338
‐ I talked that out with her.

263
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,131
You calling me a bad mother?
No. No.

264
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,758
Then what, what are you saying, Denise?
No!

265
00:19:58,782 --> 00:19:59,801
‐ What are you saying?

266
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:02,428
‐ I'm just saying something
is seriously wrong with your daughter.

267
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,871
I'm real sorry.

268
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:16,633
Fuck!

269
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,129
What?

270
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:56,798
‐ Nothing.

271
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,717
‐ What's the matter?

272
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:02,262
‐ It's cold.

273
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:06,225
‐ I don't give a shit if it's cold.
It's food. You eat it.

274
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:14,000
The Bible tells us that
no one can hide from God.

275
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,919
Why is she here?

276
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,588
‐ Look, so I couldn't get any misoprostol.
‐ What?

277
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,048
You told her?

278
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:21,841
I won't say anything. I swear.
Cool, she cool.

279
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,885
What happened?
I thought your cousin was cool.

280
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,762
‐ Well, she went to El Paso for the break.

281
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,372
- Why?
- I think to visit her dad.

282
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,850
‐ What she gotta visit her dad for?

283
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,310
I don't know.
Fuck.

284
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,728
‐ I guess it's, like,
court ordered or something.

285
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,232
Look, listen, we can do it
without the pills. - Fuck! Fuck!

286
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:38,733
How?

287
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:41,152
‐ Sunny knows.
She did it on Brittni Veaux.

288
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,971
You weren't supposed to say.
Oh, sorry.

289
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:48,451
‐ And it worked?

290
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,811
Three days after,
it just came out in the toilet.

291
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,171
‐ Look, you could call Donny again.

292
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,423
‐ I called him ten hundred times.

293
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,384
‐ You could ask your grandma.
‐ No!

294
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,034
‐ Her grandma's a Jesus freak.

295
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:10,348
...and sail west.

296
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:13,041
But the Lord found Jonah.

297
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:54,017
Adam and Eve
heard the voice of the Lord God

298
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:58,771
walking in the garden after they had
rebelled against His word.

299
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,108
They thought they could hide themselves

300
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:05,653
behind their fig leaves in amongst
the trees of the garden...

301
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,071
It's gonna hurt like hell,

302
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,491
but don't move, okay? Real still.

303
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:49,781
‐ I can't...

304
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:51,574
- I can't...
- What'd she say?

305
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,308
Stop, stop. She said stop!

306
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:03,962
‐ You want a sandwich?

307
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:05,112
‐ Yeah.

308
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,571
We closed now.

309
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,168
Got $52 cash tips.

310
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:06,399
‐ I don't want your money.

311
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,693
I want to know where Toni lives.

312
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:13,407
‐ Who is it?

313
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,935
‐ A thousand dollars.

314
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:09,105
For a place to stay and to get
my vehicle off the road.

315
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:10,422
One night.

316
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,568
This is my house.

317
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:16,112
‐ I got your address from the waitress.

318
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,804
Janine.

319
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:22,768
I won't hurt you.

320
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:26,230
I just need to get off the road.

321
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,984
Yeah? What's the catch?
There's no catch.

322
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:54,091
‐ What you got in there?

323
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:09,731
Bathroom's over there.

324
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,818
Sorry about the power.

325
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,446
‐ Thank you.

326
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,042
‐ Who are you running from, anyway?

327
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:51,273
Mama?

328
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:53,609
Hey.

329
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:55,861
Hey, baby.

330
00:28:56,612 --> 00:29:00,049
You awake? Come on, come on.

331
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:04,494
She don't do so good with men.

332
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:09,750
‐ It's okay. I won't bite.

333
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,221
What happened to your face?

334
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,641
Oh.

335
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,370
I got into a fight.

336
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:30,938
Had to sew it up.

337
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,693
Yeah, like a scarecrow.

338
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:20,232
‐ What do you want to be
when you grow up?

339
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,379
‐ I am grown up.

340
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:26,214
‐ You're just a kid.

341
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:28,448
‐ So what does that make you?
My babysitter?

342
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:33,996
I never thought about it.

343
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:37,124
Everybody thinks about it.

344
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:41,146
‐ Um, I guess, once,

345
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:45,465
I had this feeling like,
I don't know, something was coming.

346
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:51,471
I didn't know what life was gonna be,
but I knew there was gonna be one.

347
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:57,495
Then Jack came,
and that pretty much killed that.

348
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,937
‐ How so?

349
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:02,691
‐ Uh, she's messed up.

350
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:07,338
She has fits.

351
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:10,199
I don't know. I thought it was 'cause
of this or that, but...

352
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:13,035
Truth is, um...

353
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,287
‐ What?

354
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,892
‐ I think she know nobody want her.

355
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:21,126
Not me, not her daddy.

356
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:23,712
Nobody.

357
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:30,135
She's mad at the whole world
for making her get born.

358
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:35,682
I love my kid.

359
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:40,103
‐ But you're trapped.

360
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:44,650
‐ Jesus, you a shrink or somethin'?

361
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:52,616
What's in the trunk of your car?

362
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,122
‐ Can't tell you.

363
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:07,756
‐ Such a damn liar.

364
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:34,885
You wanna know what's inside of them?

365
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:42,351
Pick one.

366
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:45,103
‐ What?

367
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:47,749
‐ It's okay.

368
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:49,066
Pick one.

369
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:07,084
Good.

370
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:19,471
Open it.

371
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:46,999
‐ Please.

372
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:50,544
Please.

373
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,941
I got... I got a little girl. Please.

374
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:58,444
Please! Please. Please.

375
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,935
No, no.

376
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,163
Mama?
What?

377
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:53,542
What?

378
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:56,378
There's a lady.

379
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:03,010
‐ I hope you don't mind.
I had to borrow some clothes.

380
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:05,971
‐ Who are you?

381
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:08,807
‐ Come on. I made coffee.

382
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,270
‐ Okay.

383
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:15,355
Go watch TV.

384
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:43,050
Why don't you sit down?

385
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:46,571
‐ Who are you?

386
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:48,138
‐ I'm a friend.

387
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:52,768
‐ What was that? You talkin' code?

388
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:55,479
Where's Alex?

389
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,958
I think he's a murderer.
Bad Butcher, or whatever the hell.

390
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:04,547
‐ Yeah, Alex is a sales clerk from
Bloomington, Indiana.

391
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:07,741
And you know him?
In a sense.

392
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,702
‐ I said quit talkin' code.

393
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,502
‐ I do like you.

394
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:23,173
I know him, because...

395
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:25,568
I am him.

396
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,735
They're called "alternatives."

397
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:50,927
Modified shells that allow you
to appropriate another physique,

398
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,263
and human experience.

399
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:54,913
So, like...

400
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:58,750
...skin suits?
Yes.

401
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:04,256
You're wearing one right now?
Yes.

402
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:06,651
That's fucked.

403
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:09,178
That's what I thought, too.

404
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:13,449
‐ So, so, what?
You, you wanna take my skin?

405
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:16,685
‐ No. I just wanna tell you...

406
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:19,831
...anything you want to know.

407
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:21,982
‐ Uh... Uh...

408
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:25,753
Does it hurt?
Less every time.

409
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:27,672
How many times?
Eighteen.

410
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:29,507
‐ Shit.

411
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:31,241
So you are Alex.

412
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,285
‐ Yes.

413
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:36,538
‐ Well, who you runnin' from?

414
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:42,896
‐ Uh, his name is Mr. Grey.

415
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:54,199
He looks like a man,
but don't be fooled.

416
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:57,327
He is as far from human as they come.

417
00:41:57,351 --> 00:42:00,371
He is some kind of monster.

418
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:03,875
Maybe even the devil himself.

419
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:07,128
He'd go out nights, looking for victims.

420
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:09,797
Seduce 'em, skin 'em.

421
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:12,759
He has infinite appetite.

422
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:15,720
Pain. Pleasure.

423
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:19,122
He's obsessed with humanity.

424
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:22,560
He picked me for an accomplice.

425
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:26,380
Guess he could tell I was in the market
to shed my skin.

426
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:33,196
Eventually we acquired enough
to last a lifetime.

427
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:37,349
But done never seemed to be done.

428
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:43,272
It was the girl that made me see
he'd lost control.

429
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:47,877
She was only fifteen.

430
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,987
And he got her.

431
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:02,124
And then he became her.

432
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:06,295
I couldn't bear to see
such a young life lost.

433
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:09,941
And I had been a part of it.

434
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:11,675
It had to stop.

435
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:17,097
‐ So, what'd you do?

436
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:33,715
You killed him.

437
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:35,115
‐ Maybe.

438
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,178
I thought I saw him once.

439
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:39,304
After.

440
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:41,055
Yeah, maybe he can't die at all.

441
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:44,249
It's hard to know the rules
when you're playing someone inhuman.

442
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:49,355
Yeah, if he is alive,
he will want his stuff back.

443
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:51,048
And he won't stop.

444
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:54,301
‐ So, just give it back.

445
00:43:55,928 --> 00:43:57,095
‐ Never.

446
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:00,450
I was trapped.

447
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:03,536
Small town. Bad job.

448
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,455
Other shit, too.

449
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:11,044
But now, it's like being born again.

450
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:14,047
I can be anyone.

451
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:16,633
Feel everything.

452
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:19,469
Strike a match, and walk away.

453
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:22,204
New skin, new life.

454
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:24,581
You see?

455
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:28,502
‐ Mm‐hmm.

456
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:31,463
‐ That is what you showed me.

457
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:36,277
‐ But you killed all those people.

458
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:38,011
You helped him.

459
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:44,702
‐ Sometimes,

460
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:48,647
you have to live with what you've done...

461
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:51,251
...in order to live.

462
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,668
‐ Where we going?

463
00:45:52,628 --> 00:45:54,522
Where you wanna go?

464
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:56,274
‐ I wanna go to Beau's house.

465
00:45:56,298 --> 00:45:59,259
‐ No, no. Some place new.

466
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:03,907
Gonna get a new house.

467
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,533
New lives.

468
00:46:05,557 --> 00:46:06,659
New everything.

469
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:09,913
New names?
Yeah.

470
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:11,831
New names, too.

471
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:13,774
What do you want yours to be?

472
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,588
J‐I‐L‐L.

473
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:21,424
‐ Okay, and your mom's name?

474
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,968
‐ Her name is Isabelle.

475
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:25,178
‐ Okay.

476
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:27,371
Isabelle.

477
00:46:39,716 --> 00:46:41,194
Excuse me?

478
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:42,570
- Hi.
- Hi.

479
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:45,198
Sorry.
We're trying to get back on the One.

480
00:46:45,222 --> 00:46:46,866
Are you from here?

481
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,851
‐ No. Sorry.

482
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:55,542
We're just here seeing friends.

483
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:57,317
That's my daughter, Jill.

484
00:46:58,443 --> 00:47:01,572
We're from Denver.
I got a cousin in Denver.

485
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:03,342
‐ Oh.

486
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:07,053
‐ My cousin said last winter
they got 18 inches of snow.

487
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:09,013
‐ Oh.

488
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:11,307
Yeah. It snows a lot.

489
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:14,519
We like to build snowmen, Jill and me.

490
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:16,396
In our yard.

491
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,356
She likes to put the carrot for the nose.

492
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,984
Oh, that's cute.
Sorry?

493
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,986
‐ I said that's real cute.

494

1
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,557
<i>Four, three, two...</i>

2
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,101
one.

3
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,945
Oh, God.

4
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,951
Ten more. Then we go again.

5
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,618
Hey!

6
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:47,334
- Hey!
- There's no one out there, Scott.

7
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,429
- It's not right.
- No, maybe it is!

8
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,931
I feel like...

9
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:05,936
where my movement ends,
your movement begins.

10
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,981
Maybe they're connected,
like pieces of a puzzle.

11
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:12,025
It's like that,
it's just sharper more.

12
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,029
The fingers open and bend almost like
they're broken and just hanging.

13
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,240
Why don't you just break
your fucking fingers, man?

14
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,910
Hey!

15
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,378
Scott, maybe
we should let Rachel sleep.

16
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,088
No, she's...

17
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,673
She gonna be out cold
for at least another day.

18
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,804
I'll bet you
he's making the gas stronger.

19
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,810
Maybe she's got a movement
inside her.

20
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:50,355
Let's see, you got a bird,
he's got a sea creature.

21
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,190
I wonder what's next.

22
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:58,405
I mean, what'd you...

23
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,074
What'd you think? You think...

24
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,787
You think you're gonna
break your fingers back...

25
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:09,958
and... and this glass is gonna melt?

26
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:14,046
And a... and a door in the rock
is gonna open

27
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,382
and we're just gonna follow
a yellow brick road right out of here?

28
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,094
'Cause of some movements
that you fucking hallucinated?

29
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:26,058
How did you explain your NDE
to people in Pittsburgh?

30
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,101
I didn't.

31
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,271
Why, because people would think
you're insane?

32
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:36,193
No, because I knew better than to talk
about things you can't talk about.

33
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,527
That's it.

34
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,198
I have no idea
how to talk about this.

35
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,201
- That's why we're just doing it.
- Doing what?

36
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,660
Getting us out of here.

37
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,832
And when Rachel wakes up,
maybe she'll try it, too,

38
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,293
- and then and maybe you will.
- Prairie...

39
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,047
I liked you better
when you were blind.

40
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,622
Sorry, I don't speak Spanish.

41
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,909
Please.

42
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,165
Are you a feminist?

43
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,794
Uh, I like symmetry.

44
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,341
You were at the concert.

45
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,927
I saw you.

46
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,304
I didn't think you saw anyone.

47
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,145
I don't look in the beginning,

48
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,063
but at the end, I take in the crowd.

49
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,400
It's like sleeping with a stranger

50
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,278
and then asking their name
on the way out the door.

51
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,113
To validate the intimacy.

52
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,866
Or to invalidate it.

53
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,453
Hmm. You're a wordsmith. Like your father.

54
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,790
You know him?

55
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,333
I know his work.

56
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,336
You are a poet.

57
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,632
- No, I'm a scientist.
- Hmm.

58
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,927
That's obscure work
for a scientist to know.

59
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,430
It's part of my study.

60
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,723
What do you study?

61
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,058
You.

62
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,894
And people like you.

63
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,316
Your uncanny skill level,
given how long you've been playing,

64
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,359
is miraculous to your audience.

65
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,485
It's inexplicable.

66
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,779
Not to me.

67
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,157
It's a simple scientific connection...

68
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,494
explained... by your travels.

69
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,832
I've never been off this island.

70
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,585
Your travels in death.

71
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,424
How do you know that?

72
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,761
Three years ago you drowned,
then took up guitar.

73
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,889
It is not a miracle.

74
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,017
It is economics.

75
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,771
I'm just a poor girl
trying to escape poor circumstances.

76
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,857
Well, I can help with that.

77
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,527
I have a plane, and I can guarantee you
safe passage to America

78
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,573
in exchange for
limited participation in my study.

79
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,415
I don't want to be examined.

80
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,210
I prefer to remain unknown,
even to myself.

81
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,172
The mind is a sticky thing.

82
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,518
<i>We have found that</i>

83
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,965
<i>what we have long thought
to be everything</i>

84
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,344
<i>is only a small part of a grander whole,</i>

85
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,431
<i>only one piece of a much wider cosmos.</i>

86
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,684
<i>And to, really, kind of
communicate that idea,</i>

87
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,561
<i>we've introduced this new terminology</i>

88
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,730
<i>that our universe
is just one of many universes,</i>

89
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,026
<i>populating, possibly,
a grander multiverse.</i>

90
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,113
<i>Then you're on the verge
of a scientific revolution.</i>

91
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,449
<i>This would be,
of course, a huge revolution.</i>

92
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,495
<i>It's a revolution in a way
that would complete</i>

93
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:01,624
<i>a meta-revolution that's been
in the making for five centuries.</i>

94
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,793
<i>You know, a long time ago,
we all know that</i>

95
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,214
<i>we thought that the Earth
was the center of everything.</i>

96
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,799
<i>Then Copernicus comes along
and we learn that,</i>

97
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,302
<i>no, the Earth is going around the sun,</i>

98
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,431
<i>and then later, we learn the sun
is one of many stars in our galaxy,</i>

99
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,558
<i>one of hundreds of billions
of stars in our galaxy.</i>

100
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,041
<i>Then we learn that our galaxy is...</i>

101
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,240
Don't stop on my account.

102
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,783
Aren't we allowed
to do some fucking exercises?

103
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,452
Exercise, sure.

104
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,578
What is that?

105
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,556
What is that thing you're doing?
Where does that come from?

106
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,790
- We made them up.
- No.

107
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,417
No, I don't think you did, Rachel.

108
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,461
All respect that's due, Hap.

109
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,672
Um, how the fuck would you know
what we make up and what we don't?

110
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,965
No, I don't know,

111
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,301
but I can find out, Scott,
as you're all well aware.

112
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,505
So, somebody please tell me
what's going on right now.

113
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,431
Right now!

114
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,059
Scott?

115
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,648
This isn't helping anyone!

116
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,358
Help!

117
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,402
Rachel?

118
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,946
- Help! Help!
- Rachel. Rachel, calm down.

119
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,532
Hey! Hey!

120
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,784
Hey! Hey!

121
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,495
Help!

122
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,579
Help!

123
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,581
Hey!

124
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,431
Hey, Stan.

125
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,848
What was that racket?

126
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,851
Ah, it's just heavy metal.

127
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,812
Helps me concentrate.

128
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,730
Go figure.

129
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,649
So... how you doing?

130
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,360
What... what, uh...
Was just about to take a break.

131
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,779
- Will you smoke with me?
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

132
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,407
Listen, Hap, I feel bad
just coming up here,

133
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,742
but you're not exactly
listed in the phone book, uh...

134
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,703
Oh, yeah, that's... that's intentional.

135
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,497
Oh, big city doctor
in search of peace and quiet.

136
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,583
Yeah, I get that. I... I really do.

137
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:13,506
I tell you, I never thought I'd see
this old mine looking so... so homey.

138
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,301
Well, I like to maintain.

139
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,721
You know, I figure order outside
will generate order inside.

140
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,888
Yeah?

141
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,725
Hmm.

142
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,448
Your timber here needs a bit a work.

143
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,118
You'll wanna get that done
before the rain comes in spring.

144
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,413
Right, thanks. Well, uh, will do.

145
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,124
Let me know if you need some help.

146
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,754
Is there something
I can help you with today, Stan?

147
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,089
You don't come around much, and...

148
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,594
You know my wife, Evelyn.

149
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,139
We've been struggling with her illness.

150
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,601
ALS is a merciless disease. It's...

151
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,397
I don't know
how much more of this she can take.

152
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,902
It became impossible
for her to walk and grasp things,

153
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,154
but we still talked and talked.

154
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,990
She could laugh.

155
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,701
But now...

156
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,955
it's just so goddamn lonely.

157
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,541
It's like I'm living in a haunted house.

158
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,210
I can only imagine.

159
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,089
She's completely trapped
in her own body.

160
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,467
It's like she's living in a cage.

161
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,513
She can blink, "yes..."

162
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,766
she can blink, "no," but that's it.

163
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,478
Now, we're not crazy.

164
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,607
We just need a little bit of hope.

165
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:59,195
I don't know what to tell you, Stan,
it's...

166
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,322
It's irreversible.

167
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:04,451
I can't candy coat it.
It's a slow... painful death.

168
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,494
It's what it is, I'm sorry.

169
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,417
Uh, I feel foolish driving up here.

170
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,546
But, um... you're a doctor.

171
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,256
I'd feel even more of a fool
if I didn't try.

172
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,592
Sure, no, I'm... I'm glad you came up.

173
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:26,514
Uh... why don't I, um, look into it,
see if there's any new research,

174
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:29,351
or cutting edge things
coming out of Europe.

175
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,894
They have less regulation than us,
you never know.

176
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,732
We'd appreciate that.

177
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,821
I'm glad you stopped by.
Stan, it's good to see you.

178
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,782
I'll... I'll do whatever I can.

179
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,596
- He took him.
- I didn't hear the gas.

180
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,724
He took him upstairs.

181
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,854
<i>Police say seven people were killed</i>

182
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:30,383
<i>after a shooter opened fire inside
a shopping mall on Tuesday evening.</i>

183
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,094
<i>Authorities are searching
for the suspected shooter,</i>

184
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,197
<i>whom they say left the scene...</i>

185
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,681
<i>...before the police arrived.</i>

186
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,307
<i>He was last seen walking towards...</i>

187
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,759
Oh, so that's how they beat him?
The fucking Paleo Diet?

188
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,763
You know, bad language
obscures rather than clarifies, Steven.

189
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,472
Just tell us what's bothering you.

190
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,142
Okay, OA eats a bird,
then Homer eats a starfish,

191
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,535
and that's how they get the movements?

192
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,103
Homer didn't eat a starfish.

193
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,772
Look, which fish is not the issue.

194
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,499
Well, it makes sense
if you just think about it.

195
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,067
Oh, is this that invisible self shit?

196
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,277
Swallow before you speak.

197
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,613
I'm not on the lacrosse team.
I never learned to swallow.

198
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:34,906
Okay, easy, boys.

199
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,283
Okay, but what's Hap
gonna do to Homer?

200
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,327
Well, we know Homer's alive,
'cause OA wants to find him.

201
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,665
That doesn't mean he can't be,
like, brain damaged, or lose his legs.

202
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,416
Or maybe this is it.

203
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,169
When Homer gets trapped,
maybe it's the end of her story.

204
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,257
Shit. I gotta go.

205
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,260
You can't just drop a bomb like that
and cut out.

206
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,063
No, I'm gonna be late
for practice again. See you guys later.

207
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,854
Uh, French, hey...
Ready for the big night?

208
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:07,939
Yeah.

209
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,693
That's, um, that's quite
an interesting group you're sitting with.

210
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,322
Hey, I sort of, uh, pride myself
on my high school anthropology.

211
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,324
But for the life of me...

212
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,953
I can't imagine
what the five of you have in common.

213
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,872
Hey, man,
what happened to your head?

214
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,334
Oh... it's nothing.

215
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,961
- You sure? You okay?
- Yeah.

216
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,587
Fine. Lacrosse.

217
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,672
Yeah, 'course.

218
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,590
See you at the scholarship dinner.

219
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,516
How do you know what's right?

220
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,642
What do you mean?

221
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:50,439
Like, even just bringing this game,
it's kind of dangerous to make a mistake.

222
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,776
Where do you find the confidence
to guide another person?

223
00:19:54,777 --> 00:20:00,282
It's just a combination of instinct
and training, like anything, I guess.

224
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,039
Could life experience work like training?

225
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,290
Yeah, over time.

226
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:12,211
But you'd start out
making a ton of rookie mistakes.

227
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,755
Nice and slow.

228
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,498
You're training for something?

229
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,886
You know I have a mission.

230
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,596
Mmm.

231
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,307
What makes you so sure
the FBI can't help with it?

232
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,393
Can't help those other captives?

233
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:30,980
They're gone.

234
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,231
As in, passed?

235
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,567
No, off the board.

236
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,866
You worried the same thing
might happen to you?

237
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,951
I want it to happen to me.

238
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,038
Should I be worried, then?

239
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,290
I don't want you taken off the board.

240
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:55,963
The more days that pass here,

241
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,357
the more I think
it couldn't have happened.

242
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,009
Hey, I saw the medical reports, okay?

243
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,469
Vitamin D deficiency,
dental decay, metal residue.

244
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,953
Copper in those scars on your back?

245
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,766
You did not imagine it.

246
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,518
I couldn't have imagined love.

247
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:14,231
Well, can I ask, is he or she
one of the captives you left behind?

248
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,170
- He is.
- Okay, so let's accept, for a minute,

249
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,964
your claim the FBI can't help him.
Does that mean you have to do it alone?

250
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,532
Oh, I'm not alone.

251
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:34,501

256
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,555
I wish I could sing.

257
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,499
Can't carry a tune in a bag.

258
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,417
Still, what do you do with a choir voice?

259
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:19,505
I mean, career-wise, I mean,
we're all about industry here.

260
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,801
Michigan's economy is ranked,
what, 13th in the nation now?

261
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:24,886
Yes, sir.

262
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,638
GM, Dow, Whirlpool.
Lot of potential for you there.

263
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,056
Definitely.

264
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,309
But, if I were you,
I'd look into politics.

265
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,979
Situation with the demographic now?

266
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,899
A smart kid like you,
put yourself right into the statehouse.

267
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,400
- Thank you.
- I'd vote for ya!

268
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,194
Thank you.
Um, could you excuse me for a second?

269
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,363
Uh, sorry, I should really go see
where my mom is.

270
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,697
And he loves his mama.

271
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,784
Where do I sign the check?

272
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:53,949
He's a good kid.

273
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,422
Wine all over the place, carpet stained.

274
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:07,094
Well, you...
Next time, you have to use Tide Ultra.

275
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,459
- Tide?
- Yeah, it'll take it all out.

276
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,615
- Tide Ultra?
- Mom.

277
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,783
- Yeah!
- Tide?

278
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,018
Mom.

279
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,146
- Alfonso! Hi, baby.
- You missed half the dinner.

280
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,272
People are starting to go.

281
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,732
Okay, I'll go inside.

282
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,194
I'm just enjoying my cigarette.
Okay? Go.

283
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,861
I'm Chris. I'm Peyton's dad.

284
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,493
Okay, say bye to your friends,

285
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,121
and that fat teacher
who talked my ear off.

286
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,756
I'm gonna grab my coat.
Can I get you anything?

287
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,628
- Uh, yeah...
- No, she's fine.

288
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:45,632
What is wrong with you?

289
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:49,428
He's married, okay?
All the fucking dads here are married.

290
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,098
Why're you telling me the fucking dads
are, like I am some child?

291
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,076
No, you know,
this was supposed to be the one night.

292
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,142
What?

293
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,769
You want another medal?

294
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,146
Mom...

295
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,333
...I'm the one who has two jobs
because you can't work.

296
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,792
- Mmm.
- But it's crazy to expect you

297
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,486
to act like an adult for once. Just...

298
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,280
What? Just what?

299
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,865
I don't even know.

300
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,575
I have worked so hard for this...

301
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,370
Yes, you've worked so hard,

302
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:18,124
but you do not know what life is, Alfonso.

303
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,294
You don't know how hard it really gets.

304
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,131
What, you don't think
I had dreams like yours?

305
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:30,011
I lived in Paris, but I...
I'm here with you.

306
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,471
Is that so bad?

307
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:40,479
No, no. Listen, you are strong, yes.

308
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,400
But you do not know everything, okay?

309
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,486
You only see
what I haven't done.

310
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,697
But what about what I have given you?

311
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,699
What I have done?

312
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,162
Giving you some kind of life
that can make this happen.

313
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:00,332
Okay, I... I'm proud of you, yes.

314
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,875
You got this medal, but...

315
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,212
you don't need this
to be the man you will be.

316
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,966
Okay? You will be the man
you will be no matter what.

317
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,677
Okay?

318
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,560
Buck, can you grab my bag?

319
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,990
Come on. Can you stand?

320
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:36,243
- Mmm.
- Come on.

321
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,095
Are we the good guys, Buck?

322
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,848
Yeah, what do you mean?

323
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,519
I mean, even Hap was young
at some point.

324
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,354
Like a doctor in some ER.

325
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,191
And before that, he was a kid
in a medical school somewhere.

326
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,154
And before that, probably played
in the high school band.

327
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,157
What if, I don't know...

328
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,659
we change?

329
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,786
No...

330
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,205
We won't change like that.

331
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:05,999
No way.

332
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,358
Hi, guys.

333
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,319
Hey.

334
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:37,448
<i>People who want power will always
try to control those who truly possess it.</i>

335
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,033
Hap didn't know what was going on
in the basement,

336
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:43,036
but he knew it was dangerous
to allow it to continue.

337
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,415
It gave us strength, unity,

338
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,542
and he knew Homer was the linchpin.

339
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,464
What happens next is hard to hear.

340
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:58,802
Because it's... hard to understand
how confusing freedom is

341
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,054
when you've been a prisoner for so long,

342
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,391
<i>how hard it is to grasp
that you have choice,</i>

343
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,310
<i>that you can act,</i>

344
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:10,647
<i>how unimaginable the sun is if you've
been living underground for years.</i>

345
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,024
What?

346
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,569
Where are we going?

347
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,992
You're gonna help me with something.

348
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:36,340
If anything happens to me,
your friends all die in the laboratory.

349
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,567
They starve to death down there.

350
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,009
So, bear that in mind.

351
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,179
Oh, there's a microphone in your shirt.

352
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,182
So, I'll be with you at every stage.

353
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,936
Please don't talk too loudly.
You'll give me a headache.

354
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,072
I'm in danger.
I'm in serious, serious danger.

355
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,356
Please, just help. I need...
We need to call the police.

356
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,953
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

357
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,372
Please hurry.

358
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,554
<i>- Sí, sí.</i>
- No, no, no, no. No, no.

359
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,889
Who are you calling? Who are you...

360
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,185
They said you were having
some kind of breakdown.

361
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,606
I told them about my son, of course.

362
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,942
The golden boy with the brain damage
from the football injury.

363
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,277
They're worried about you.

364
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,281
Now, come on, Homer.
We're having a nice time, aren't we?

365
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:34,077
All you have to do is convince her
to come up to your room.

366
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,330
Then you can have a nice long sleep
with the window open

367
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,374
and the ocean breeze blowing through.

368
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,334
I'm gonna call...

369
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,504
Who? Who you gonna call?

370
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,465
- The FBI.
- And tell them what, exactly?

371
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,383
That you keep us in a cellar.

372
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,636
Where's that?

373
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,265
A mine.

374
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,683
An abandoned mine.

375
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:57,934
- A mine.
- Yeah.

376
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,352
That should be easy to find.

377
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,955
Well, how many of them could there be?

378
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,899
With that kind of dust, and those
kinds of trees? What, a hundred?

379
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,610
Approximately 500,000 in North America.

380
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,446
But the FBI, they would...
they would find them.

381
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,407
They would search
all over the country in, like, 24 hours.

382
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,867
No, less than 12 hours.

383
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,078
They'd figure it out, they'd find you,
and... and they'd rescue them.

384
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,830
You're a smart boy, Homer.

385
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:19,998
Use your brain.

386
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,167
The FBI are not coming to Cuba.

387
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,920
They're not coming to get you
and they're not coming to get me.

388
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,507
And if you somehow prevent me
from getting back there,

389
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,927
you would starve Prairie
and all your friends to death.

390
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,011
Is that what you want?

391
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,722
- I can't hear you. Is that what you want?
- No.

392
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,559
No. Me neither.

393
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,563
So, turn around
and go and finish getting ready.

394
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:45,690
Now.

395
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,305
<i>Gracias.</i>

396
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:20,767
Eat up. It's good.

397
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,234
Here.

398
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,363
There you go.

399
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:50,756
Do you smoke?

400
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,092
Try it.

401
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,636
It'll calm you down.

402
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,057
If you like it,
we can smoke cigars later.

403
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,104
She's the one we're here for.

404
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,399
She likes to dance on the veranda.

405
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:18,486
After the evening is over,
you're gonna invite her up to your room.

406
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,989
Me?

407
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:25,160
<i>She likes handsome young men.
I'll do the rest.</i>

408
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,997
So, how old are you, Homer?

409
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,586
I'm not sure.

410
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,008
Twenty-two?

411
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,820
- Twenty-five?
- I'm not sure. I don't know.

412
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,054
Maybe.

413
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,808
Have you been to Cuba before?

414
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,312
I've never even seen the ocean before.

415
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:58,109
So much you don't know.

416
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,196
Water?

417
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,659
I'm sorry.

418
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:09,830
Did you invite me up to this room
to seduce me?

419
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,457
Or do you want to be seduced?

420
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,250
Oh!

421
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,226
You are trembling.

422
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,186
Whoa!

423
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,523
Hey, hey. Come... Come, come.

424
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,996
What are you doing?
Don't worry about that.

425
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,664
Shh, you should sleep.

426
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,502
And I should go.

427
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,711
Yeah.

428
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,673
Something happened to you?

429
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,469
Yes.

430
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,722
A secret?

431
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,058
Go. Please go.

432
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,852
Please.

433
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,770
I'm sorry. Just...

434
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:35,373
They say at the bar that a crazy man
was running through the hotel earlier.

435
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,878
Maybe they just thought he was crazy.

436
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,630
Maybe he was just a prisoner
trying to break free.

437
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,184
I'm a prisoner, too.

438
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,270
Of this island.

439
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,128
You taste like cold water.

440
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,425
Say it again.

441
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,430
<i>Say it again, Homer.</i>

442
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,766
<i>What you said. You said I played like...</i>

443
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,561
<i>- A maniac. A maniac.
- No!</i>

444
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,964
<i>- You're a fucking maniac.
- Angel! Angel!</i>

445
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,691
<i>Yes, yes. Fuck, yes!</i>

446
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,734
<i>You're an angel.</i>

447
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,628
He's alive.

448
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:30,256
How can Homer do it?

449
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,218
- How could he have done that to you?
- Relax, man.

450
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:34,719
OA, what happens next?

451
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,929
No, no. I would have never given in.

452
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,681
He should have kept trying.

453
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,395
Try to imagine what it's like

454
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,689
to have been a prisoner
for all those years.

455
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,193
You're not free just because
you can see the ocean.

456
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,654
Captivity is a mentality.
It's a thing you carry with you.

457
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:08,544
Hap succeeded.

458
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,631
He broke the rebellion
by making Homer complicit

459
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,299
in kidnapping Renata.

460
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:16,469
He made us feel
we couldn't possibly be angels.

461
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,222
We were too human.

462
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:22,183
Fucking liar! I hate you!

463
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,477
Scum of the Earth.

464
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,902
OA.

465
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,325
It isn't Homer that's doing this to us.

466
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,410
It's him.

467
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,291
You told us.

468
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,753
You told us that we're down here
to find each other.

469
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,381
To find out what we are.

470
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,218
Maybe even Renata.

471
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:00,596
You said we needed five.

472
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:02,682
We're five.

473
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,684
I was wrong.

474
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,936
Look at me.

475
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,647
OA, look at me.

476
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,278
Fuck me!

477
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:23,453
It's broken?

478
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:28,374
My fucking luck.

479
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,506
Listen...

480
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,676
if he comes for me...
I ain't comin' back.

481
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,347
I'm... I'm too sick.

482
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,609
Hap, you know I won't survive
another round.

483
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,362
I ain't no championship quarterback.

484
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:58,488
You'll be fine.

485
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,030
No. Don't, don't, don't.

486
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,532
Please, just wait.

487
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:05,202
I can tell you things.
I've got information.

488
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:08,289
Look, uh, my fingers go in here?

489
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,417
See? I ain't struggling.

490
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,004
All right, it's your choice.

491
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:21,135
What's that? What is that?

492
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,762
It's gel.

493
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,431
It makes the collar
slide nicely over your head.

494
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,558
Keeps your hair in place.

495
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,184
- Uh...
- All right.

496
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,562
Head down.

497
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,273
Lower.

498
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,778
What information, Scott?

499
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:43,240
You know they're trying to escape?

500
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,534
Homer and Prairie.

501
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,330
They're, uh... they're practicing these...
these movements.

502
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:51,666
All night long, while you're asleep.

503
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,545
Yeah, they were.

504
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,339
She says it's gonna open up a...

505
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:00,883
- ...a celestial door.
- Mmm-hmm.

506
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,594
A portal that they can...
that they can escape through.

507
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,432
She thinks they're angels.

508
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,059
Is that right?

509
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,520
Lean your head back. Chin down.

510
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,229
Keep still. Stop talking.

511
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:23,072
There we go.

512
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,163
Look, I...
I gave you good information, right?

513
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:36,293
I was thinking maybe you...
you skip the experiment and, uh,

514
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:39,254
and send me back to my cell.

515
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:42,592
Well... it is good information, Scott,

516
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:45,928
but most important thing
we do here is the work.

517
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,638
Collect the data.

518
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,141
We're gonna change the world.

519
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,479
And that's it.

520
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:04,071
You... you think you know everything.

521
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,032
Some fucking doctor you are.
Did you know she can see?

522
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,122
Since her last NDE.

523
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,541
Since you whacked her in the head.

524
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:19,420
She's been playin' you for a fool.

525
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:24,384
You broke their rebellion. You did.

526
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:28,888
You broke him, and you broke her, too.

527
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,893
You showed her
that he ain't nothin' but an animal.

528
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,855
No, I changed my mind.
I want the gas! I want the gas!

529
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:41,401
You know, just because
she doesn't love him

530
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:43,604
doesn't mean she's ever
gonna love a monster like you.

531
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:45,988
You know what she calls you?

532
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,616
She calls you the "Angel Hunter."

533
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,799
Oh!

534
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,050
Oh, shit.

535
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,384
Aah...

536
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,576
You lied to me.

537
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,289
You did this.

There...

553
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,427
there are movements.

554
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,555
Five of 'em.

555
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:55,644
And you need five people...

556
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,312
at least.

557
00:55:57,396 --> 00:56:00,190
The movements, they...

558
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:05,029
they do things we... cannot imagine.

559
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:10,492
Five movements... open a...

560
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:15,247
a tunnel to another dimension.

561
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,332
Our freedom.

<i>♪ And we're going downtown ♪</i>

563
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:29,553

How we're going to save them?

575
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,612
I'm gonna teach you the movements.

576
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,655
All five of them.

577
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:33,825
We're gonna open a tunnel into
another dimension. I will travel there...

578
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,162
<i>and rescue them.</i>

1
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,937
Excuse me. Mrs. Johnson?
Nancy Johnson?

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,605
- Hi...
- Excuse me. I don't. I...

3
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,401
I... I'm Pat. Pat Knowler.
I write for the <i>Chicago Tribune.</i>

4
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,524
I'm sorry, I...
I don't have anything to say to you.

5
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:31,699
No. You don't have to say anything,
but please listen.

6
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:35,327
I specialize in long-form
investigative reporting...

7
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,079
Yeah, I've read the headlines.

8
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,202
- No.
- "Michigan Miracle."

9
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,582
No, that's not what I do.

10
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,542
I help people like Prairie
tell their stories

11
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,918
honestly and respectfully.

12
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,753
Do you know what would be respectful?

13
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,339
To let me go on shopping.

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,972
I won the National Book Award for this.

15
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,434
I'm only trying to say
that my work is not sensationalistic.

16
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,979
- I spent eight months with that family.
- I don't care.

17
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,148
Fifteen weeks on the <i>USA Today</i>
Best-Seller list.

18
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,275
Jamie Price and his family
are set for life.

19
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:15,909
Prairie... may never lead a normal life.

20
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,913
And she probably
won't be able to get a job.

21
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,958
I bet you burned through your savings
trying to find her.

22
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,377
It happens to every family like you.

23
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,544
We're fine.

24
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:28,756
Thank you for your time,

25
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,591
but if you change your mind,
my card is in there.

26
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,093
I fly out tomorrow.

27
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,283
Homer.

28
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,861
I'm sorry, I should have asked.

29
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,823
How long have you been a vegan?

30
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,116
Oh, going on five years.

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,578
But it's not a political
or spiritual decision.

32
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,499
Uh, more of a shift
to wanting to take control

33
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,417
of the kind of fuel that I...

34
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,838
Honey, are you okay?

35
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,966
- Burn your mouth?
- No, it's just...

36
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,259
This is so good.

37
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,179
Oh. I apologize.

38
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,848
It's so insensitive of me
to talk about my...

39
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,810
dietary decisions when Prairie...

40
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,353
It's okay.

41
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,774
You wrote the book about the boy?

42
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,068
Jamie. Amazing young man.

43
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,319
What is he like?

44
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,240
He was only eight when he was abducted.

45
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,868
Uh, 15 when he was rescued.

46
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,996
Sometimes when you talk to him
he seems really young.

47
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,956
And other times, really old.

48
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,332
Nothing in between.

49
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,252
What happened to him

50
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,505
makes him a creature apart.

51
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,967
On a different frequency, you know?

52
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,599
So... for the book.

53
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,559
When would you start?

54
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,187
Well, that's up to Prairie.

55
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:53,483
I would never rush this, but...
Prairie, here's the thing.

56
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:59,197
The process can sometimes
help people to heal.

57
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,533
Storytelling is cleansing.

58
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,787
But I also want to make sure
you control the narrative.

59
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,788
That you profit from it.

60
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,289
Hmm.

61
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,502
And did it heal them?

62
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,130
All the money?

63
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:19,968
It's given his family a security
that they've never known.

64
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:24,264
But more importantly,
the process of telling this story

65
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,434
has somehow exorcised it.

66
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,311
Jamie will tell you.

67
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:33,064
He says that when we typed, "The end..."

68
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,692
that meant it was truly over.

69
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,202
Sorry.

70
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,122
- I don't think that...
- What's that, honey?

71
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,198
I think this isn't gonna work.

72
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,461
But I can...
We can do it however you...

73
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,130
I can't give you
what Jamie gave you is the problem.

74
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,216
It's not about you giving me any...

75
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,968
His story has an end.

76
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,512
- Well...
- I'm...

77
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,140
This is just beginning.

78
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,562
I'm very, very... I'm very sorry.

79
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,699
<i>The first time
you fall asleep in prison...</i>

80
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,952
<i>you forget.</i>

81
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,204
You wake up a free woman.

82
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,041
And then you remember that you're not.

83
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,796
<i>You lose your freedom many times
before you finally believe it.</i>

84
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,805
You have to eat.

85
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,100
The pellets make me sick to my stomach.

86
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,601
You'll acclimate.

87
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,321
I'm gonna lose my mind down here.

88
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,116
Is that part of this?

89
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,162
No.

90
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,873
Talk to the others.

91
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,209
Keep your mind busy. I...

92
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,879
I can get you braille books.
What do you like to read?

93
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:04,341
I won't be able to live
without sunlight and air.

94
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,843
- The others have.
- The others aren't blind.

95
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,413
<i>Night slipped into day.</i>

96
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,502
<i>Day into night.</i>

97
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,386
Where is August?

98
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,638
What have you done with her?

99
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,099
I need to know that she's okay.

100
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,683
She needs me.

101
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,229
Enough, Rachel.
You know he's taken her upstairs.

102
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,231
She needs me.

103
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,280
<i>We were like the living dead.</i>

104
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,575
<i>Right next to each other, but alone.</i>

105
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,915
<i>There's nothing more isolating
than not being able to feel time.</i>

106
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,399
Let me out!

107
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,129
<i>To not feel the distance
between hours, days.</i>

108
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,765
You're alive.

109
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,434
You're alive. You're alive.

110
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,492
You're gonna get out of here.

111
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,203
Is anyone awake?

112
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,268
Jesus.

113
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,855
Did you just...
throw up in our fuckin' water?

114
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,441
I need water.

115
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,735
No drinking water right now.

116
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,154
We're using it to wash up.

117
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,771
Okay. Come on.

118
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,190
Let's go.

119
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,710
There's a door in front of you.
Push it.

120
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,931
Hold on.

121
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,643
Thank you.

122
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,356
That's enough.

123
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,101
Take the other half.

124
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,028
You won't eat 'cause the others can't.

125
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,155
Is that it?

126
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,577
Make 'em all sandwiches.

127
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,039
I don't care.

128
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,260
Big step. Hold on.

129
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,125
Here.

130
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,641
You know, somebody might want
to show some gratitude.

131
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:34,726
This is because of her.

132
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,733
It won't be a regular occurrence.

133
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,819
Why'd you have to fuck it up with mustard?

134
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,085
Look, look.

135
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,213
Hey, hey. Hey, you.

136
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,509
You don't have to bang on the glass.
I can hear you.

137
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,843
Come here. Come, come.

138
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,344
Please.

139
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,776
You got upstairs.

140
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:27,987
I did.

141
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,406
What's it like up there?

142
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,910
The sun was out.

143
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,247
You gotta get my ring.

144
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,792
I stashed it up there
when he brought me in.

145
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,044
It's in the bathroom.
You gotta bring it down for me.

146
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,755
And a bill...
A bill for water, gas, anything.

147
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,299
You gotta help me out, okay?
He trusts you.

148
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,343
What... I don't...
What are you talking about?

149
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,889
So, like, a year and 36 days ago,

150
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:59,351
this guy says he'll give me 500 bucks
to participate in this study about NDEs.

151
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:04,440
You see, Mandy, my son's mom...

152
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,402
she told me she was pregnant.
Two months along. She just found out.

153
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,406
I wanted to prove to her
that even though we weren't together,

154
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,702
I would be a great dad.
I could support our son.

155
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,954
I thought I'd do the study
and give her the 500 bucks

156
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,455
as a symbol of that.

157
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,958
So I get in the car with him.

158
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,086
And he drives me here
and I asked to go to the bathroom.

159
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:30,925
And I had this feeling, this...
this sinking feeling, uh...

160
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,222
As soon as I got to the bathroom,

161
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,141
I just stashed my championship
football ring in the medicine cabinet.

162
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,410
I knew something was coming for me.

163
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,646
I had to leave a trace,
in case I disappeared.

164
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,856
Look.

165
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,817
Look.

166
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Oh...

167
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:50,945
Oh, shit.

168
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,365
I... I forgot that, uh...

169
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:56,909
Um...

170
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,955
Well, I still have the money.

171
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,289
Isn't that fucked up?

172
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,334
Well, what are you gonna do
with your ring and a bill?

173
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,503
You're gonna mail it.

174
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,924
And you'll leave a note in it
saying to send it to Mandy.

175
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,051
She could use it to get my son, uh,

176
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,263
diapers, or clothes,
or little music tapes to make him smart.

177
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,057
Are you kidding me?

178
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,561
If I ever get up there again
I have to, like, find a phone

179
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,039
or hit him over the head with some...

180
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,775
This is more important than that,
all right? Please.

181
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:33,988
We are down here.
There is nothing to do about that.

182
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:38,242
But my son is out there every day
without a father.

183
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:44,415
It kills me every day to think
he thinks I walked out on him.

184
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,880
- How do you know it's a boy?
- What?

185
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,008
What if you have a daughter?

186
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,511
Are you listening to me?
I don't feel like you're listening to me.

187
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:58,888
I'm listening. I...

188
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,598
I just need a moment to think...

189
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,894
about my own plan.

190
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,689
Prairie, Prairie, Prairie, Prairie.

191
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,213
Fuck! No, no, no.

192
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,090
Cover your vent, Prairie.

193
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,257
What's that smell?

194
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,719
- Get on your bed. Stand on it. Now!
- No. It's not my turn!

195
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,805
Feel the wall near the ceiling.

196
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,849
The wall near the ceiling.

197
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,810
To the right, way to the right.

198
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,019
Way.

199
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,730
More to the right!

200
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,441
More. Keep going. There.

201
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,091
Homer... what happened?

202
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,385
<i>Homer?</i>

203
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,445
A family was gonna live here.

204
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,030
Probably not.

205
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,615
They just built it
and then the economy went to shit.

206
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:28,329
But if that hadn't happened,
some family would have had a life here.

207
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,891
It's not really something you think about

208
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,917
when you're looking for somewhere
to deal out of.

209
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,087
Fighting in the kitchen, kids being born,

210
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,756
heartache, sex, probably in this tub.

211
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,468
Until they don't anymore.

212
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,180
Kids movin' out. Parents getting sick.

213
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,349
People getting old.

214
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,060
You sound like one of the poetry kids.

215
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,981
Poetry kids?

216
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:59,693
You know, the ones who write poems
about, like, cutting themselves and shit.

217
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,496
You said we were gonna help people.

218
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:15,542
Did you mean, like,
Homer and Scott and Rachel?

219
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,840
So this is dangerous?

220
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,391
Families suck.

221
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:32,935
Yeah.

222
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,230
Not all of them, though.

223
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:41,027
Not the ones you build
out of strange pieces.

224
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,112
And they work.

225
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,656
They don't look like they should,
but they do.

226
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,316
Hey. Left my bag.

227
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,318
Yo, I just passed OA running out.

228
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,946
Uh, she looked upset, too.

229
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,863
Hey, what'd you do to her?

230
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,199
Nothing.

231
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,952
Don't treat me like I'm some
fucking pedophile or something.

232
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,635
Pedophiles are people who are into kids.

233
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,581
You think
you're so fucking smart, don't you?

234
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,351
You think you're the king of the world
and we're your dumb little servants?

235
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,728
- What are you talking about?
- Hey, don't forget, I know you.

236
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,340
And I know the shitty, smelly house
you crawled out of this morning.

237
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,258
I'm this close to beating the shit
out of you.

238
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,677
- Then go ahead, take a swing.
- I'm not 12 anymore.

239
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,722
I beat the shit out of you then.
I can beat the shit out of you now.

240
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,975
Right. 'Cause you never change.

241
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,727
And that's why your parents
want to send you to that place.

242
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,192
Bitch.

243
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,423
Pussy!

244
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,547
<i>Hey, again. Rod Spence.
Calling you about your brother's estate.</i>

245
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,310
<i>Could you please, uh...</i>

246
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,427
<i>Rod Spence, uh, trying you again.</i>

247
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,887
<i>Your, uh, brother's will.
Please call me back.</i>

248
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,849
<i>Hey, Otter. Theo.</i>

249
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,228
<i>Just throwing out a line
to see what comes back.</i>

250
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,070
<i>Hey, Otter. Theo.</i>

251
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,698
<i>Just throwing out a line
to see what comes back.</i>

252
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,831
<i>Hey, Otter. Theo.</i>

253
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,167
<i>Just throwing out a line
to see what comes back.</i>

254
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,753
Steven.

255
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,131
Yeah, I'm on my way. Right now.

256
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,383
Okay, good.

257
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,884
I stuck my neck out for you

258
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,011
with Principal Gilchrist and your parents.

259
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,304
- You are?
- Uh, Winchell.

260
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,971
Take the open seat.

261
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,055
And?

262
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:24,185
Hit the space bar.
It's pretty self-explanatory.

263
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,574
<i>Welcome to the Alternative School.</i>

264
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,285
<i>You're here because you aren't
the typical student.</i>

265
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,371
<i>Traditional environments
don't work for you, but that's okay.</i>

266
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:47,999
<i>At the Alternative School,
you can pick your subjects each day</i>

267
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,876
<i>and work at your own pace.</i>

268
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,546
<i>Pretty neat. Shall we get started?</i>

269
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,905
Can you see them better now,
you little bitch?

270
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,929
I didn't do anything.

271
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,933
Dude.

272
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,811
How about now?
Can you see 'em better now?

273
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,020
Just working on my geometry.

274
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,064
There's no Euclid on my tits,
you fucking freak.

275
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,357
That's my water.

276
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,507
- That's an extra week.
- How long it takes your dick to get hard.

277
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,388
What happened to you?

278
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,680
Lacrosse.

279
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,325
Steve.

280
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,036
Come sit down.

281
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,709
Is it okay?

282
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,774
Here's something I can tell you.

283
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,320
It's really hard to kill a man.

284
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,948
It's even hard to allow a man to die.

285
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,966
<i>I became his housekeeper.</i>

286
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,677
<i>And slowly learned his ways.</i>

287
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:09,016
<i>He trusted me because I was blind
and couldn't see his work.</i>

288
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,892
<i>Which is all he ever did.</i>

289
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,655
Are you sick?

290
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,158
You can tell what I'm doing?

291
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,702
No, I just...

292
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,330
used to hear that sound
all the time as a kid.

293
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,876
I don't like to sleep,
it's a waste of time, but...

294
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,253
it's necessary, so...

295
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,672
...sleeping pills.

296
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,637
That's enough for tonight.
You can finish in the morning.

297
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,108
<i>I knew what I had to do.</i>

298
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,529
<i>I just had to figure out
how to do it under his nose.</i>

299
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,575
<i>Hap got his food and supplies online.</i>

300
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,453
<i>A delivery once a month.</i>

301
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,208
<i>When I had crushed enough
sleeping pills...</i>

302
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,836
<i>I asked him to order the ingredients</i>

303
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,088
<i>for a stew my father had taught me
to make.</i>

304
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,693
Why do Russians love beets so much?

305
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,447
Beets survive frost.

306
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,326
Hmm. Of course.

307
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,703
Something always survives.

308
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:23,418
When I was a boy,
there was a PBS program that I loved.

309
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,798
Hosted by this...
this very proper British scientist.

310
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,512
And he would go to, uh,
some impossible altitude or...

311
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,223
some big desert somewhere.

312
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,808
He was always whispering...

313
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:42,103
"I'm standing here
in the remotest part of the world,

314
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,730
where nothing should survive."

315
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:49,736
There was always
some creature that was thriving.

316
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,781
No matter how harsh the environment.

317
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:59,538
I loved that show.
Gave me hope.

318
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,874
It's almost done.
You said you had fresh parsley?

319
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,127
Oh, I'm sure it's fine how it is.

320
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,384
You're looking at me.

321
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,472
Yes.

322
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:36,324
Let me get you some parsley.
It's in the back garden.

323
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,576
Just be a moment.

324
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,358
Here... fresh parsley.

325
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,944
Smells earthy.

326
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,242
I'll eat when I'm done.

327
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,705
"It's never gonna taste
as good as it does right now."

328
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,416
My dad used to say that.

329
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,389
Here. Why don't you...

330
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,559
sit down?
You've worked so hard.

331
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,124
Let's eat together.

332
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,458
You should enjoy it, too.

333
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,469
Are you okay? You're sweating.

334
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,222
I... I've been over the stove.

335
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,062
So?

336
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,981
Give me a second.
What's the rush?

337
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,778
I've never made someone
something from my childhood before.

338
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,914
It's good.

339
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,211
It's really nice.

340
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,425
You're not eating.

341
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,226
It's hard to eat.

342
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,979
It reminds me of home.

343
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,334
Are you choking?

344
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,004
What's in the soup?
What did you put in the soup?

345
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,422
Um, beets, onions,

346
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,925
vegetable stock, sour cream.

347
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,511
This vegetable stock has tomato paste.

348
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,807
I can't eat tomatoes.

349
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,100
It's okay.

350
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,559
I have an EpiPen.

351
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,706
Go and get my spare EpiPen.

352
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,377
It's in the bathroom cabinet
above the sink.

353
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,632
Don't be stupid.

354
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,425
You don't know the door code.

355
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:08,054
They're all trapped down there.
They'll... They'll starve and die.

356
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,681
Go on.

357
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,979
Forgive me.

358
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,565
Forgive me, forgive me,
forgive me, forgive me.

359
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,929
She died before you got here.

360
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,765
Her name was August.

361
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,310
Or that's what they called her.

362
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,772
Because she... she came in August.

363
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,111
Go clean up.

364
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,150
What happened?

365
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,028
He finally ass-fucked her.

366
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,738
Shut the fuck up, Scott.

367
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,450
What is it?

368
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,060
He's burying August in the morning.

369
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,043
He's outside! He's digging.

370
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,587
Okay, let's go.
Who knows how long he'll be.

371
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,131
Just like before
when I passed you the Ziploc,

372
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,967
only we're against the current now,
so it's harder.

373
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:45,230
A little more.

374
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,444
I can't. It's pushing it back.

375
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,658
All right. All right.

376
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:02,163
Think of your shoulder like it's putty.
It can stretch.

377
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,207
Just relax and then grow your arm.

378
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,637
I've got it.

379
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,639
Come on!

380
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,615
We all wanna write something.
We don't have time.

381
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,995
Who's it addressed to?

382
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,122
Verizon.

383
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:46,165
Those schmucks will think it's a prank.

384
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:47,351
No. No, they won't.

385
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,960
I used to work in a call center.
There's actual people there.

386
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,256
I need to tell Mandy
I did not run out on the baby.

387
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,499
- No, lunatic! We need to tell them...
- Shh.

388
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,010
...to get the police.
That we're trapped here.

389
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,054
Where? Where are we?

390
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,640
I was out of it. I didn't see.

391
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,559
- Out of it?
- I was high, Rachel.

392
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,271
There was a two-lane highway,
lots of dust, rocks.

393
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,316
Wait... is there a return address?

394
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,653
A PO box. New York City.

395
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:16,779
Is that traceable?

396
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:17,923
- Maybe?
- I don't know.

397
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,700
Well, we can't be more than
four hours from New York City.

398
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:21,951
Maybe five by plane.

399
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,870
- You got on a plane with him?
- You got in a car with him.

400
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,832
Describe him. Medium build...

401
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,542
Yeah, brown hair, brown eyes.

402
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,668
I think they're blue.

403
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,337
- Sharp nose.
- Not that sharp.

404
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,839
- It's distinct.
- Say that he's a doctor,

405
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,174
maybe an anesthesiologist.

406
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:39,552
And that he has a single-engine plane,
so he has a pilot's license.

407
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,555
That's good, that's good.
What do you got so far?

408
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,638
Okay.

409
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,182
"Four of us are being held captive.

410
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,309
This PO box is picked up by the captor.

411
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,894
We are held four to five hour flight
from New York City."

412
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,896
Say that he had to refuel the plane twice.

413
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,981
"Refuel..."

414
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,109
Give them...
give them my brother's address.

415
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,863
3512 Mapleton, Fort Wayne, Indiana.

416
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,949
He gonna come pick you up?
He's in a wheelchair. We need the police.

417
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,659
Fort Wayne. Prairie?

418
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,578
Nancy and Abel Johnson.

419
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,623
189 Mills Pond, Claude, Michigan.

420
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,375
Michigan. A-B-E-L.

421
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,769
- Who do you wanna put down, Scott?
- I don't wanna take up the space.

422
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,046
- There's plenty of space.
- There's no one.

423
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,922
Just tell 'em to call the FBI.

424
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,971
It's perfect. Send it back.

425
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,155
The current is strong.
Make sure you've got it.

426
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:54,994
I feel the plastic.

427
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,380
- Are you sure?
- Wait.

428
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,673
Wait, I feel...

429
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,840
I've got the corner.

430
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:01,301
You got it?

431
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,843
He's coming! He's coming.

432
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,304
I got it, I got it. I got it.

433
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,474
Wait. Wait, I lost it. I lost it.

434
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,558
Catch it downstream!
Downstream! Scott, downstream!

435
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:14,188
- To the right! To the right!
- Scott! Scott! Scott!

436
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,444
Fuck!

437
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:38,379
<i>It just... disappeared.</i>

438
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,775
Those football rings are clunky.

439
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,719
Um, wouldn't Hap have, like,
noticed it in the envelope anyway?

440
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,053
Maybe.

441
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,224
Well, you were gonna put it
in the middle of the mail pile, right?

442
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,726
Hap wouldn't notice that.

443
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,687
Oh, shut up, guys. Seriously.
You ask the dumbest questions.

444
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:59,066
- Now, how did you get it back?
- We didn't.

445
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,318
Wait, so you lost Homer's ring?

446
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:02,486
Yeah.

447
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,155
It's probably 8,000 feet underground.

448
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,202
Jesse's right.

449
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,329
I mean, it was kind of impossible.

450
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,457
An impossible hope.

451
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,085
And when it was gone...

452
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,338
everything came crashing down with it.

453
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,102
Stop.

454
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,312
You have to stop.

455
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,155
Stand up.

456
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,453
I said, stand up.

457
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,456
I can't.

458
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,377
Stand up
and put your arms in the air.

459
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:07,342
I don't... I don't...
I don't want to.

460
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:09,386
Doesn't matter. Do it.

461
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,971
Do it for me.

462
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:15,893
Get up.

463
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,480
Get up.

464
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:22,191
I can't.

465
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,401
Yes, you can. Up. Up.

466
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:29,407
Jump.

467
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:30,866
What?

468
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,368
Stop talking. Start jumping.

469
00:48:33,453 --> 00:48:34,662
Jump.

470
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,038
Again.

471
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,041
Please, I can't.

472
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,628
Oh, keep going.
Do it, Prairie. Jump.

473
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:45,840
Again.

474
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,470
Flap your arms as you jump.
Not silly, but for real.

475
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:52,930
Like your arms are giant wings.

476
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,016
Again.

477
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:58,310
Higher.

478
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:01,230
Again.

479
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,941
Again.

480
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,026
See?

481
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:14,618
You've got it. You're okay.

482
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,537
Don't fall in the water...

483
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:18,748
...or knock over a plant.

484
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,709
Am I doing jumping jacks?

485
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,670
Yeah, you're...
you're sorta doing jumping jacks.

486
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,362
Homer, I'm...

487
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,822
Don't even say it.

488
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,547
We tried to escape and we failed.

489
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,507
But we did it together.

490
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,427
We could do it again.

491
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,389
We could get outta here.

492
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,645
If I ever get out of here...

493
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,773
I'd want to sing something...

494
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,276
for my little brother.

495
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,488
Keep going.

496
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,035
I used to sing in church choir.

497
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,163
I was pretty good.

498
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:46,085
People tellin' me
I should make a go of it, so...

499
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:52,382
I took my little brother
and we snuck off.

500
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,055
It's not that we didn't love our family.
We did.

501
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,307
But there was a lot of hate in that town.

502
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,895
My father was like all of them.

503
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,734
Stole the family van.

504
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,196
Headed to Nashville.

505
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,284
I thought I could raise my brother myself.

506
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,629
But the van flipped on the highway.

507
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,049
Collapsed all around us.

508
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:44,393
But I... was floating above the car.

509
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:51,233
And I could see my little brother's
red backpack in the middle of the road.

510
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:55,487
You died and came back?

511
00:51:56,822 --> 00:52:00,993
Everyone here...
really died and came back.

512
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:03,871
Yeah, my...

513
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:07,875
my voice changed after that.

514
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,378
Became something else.

515
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,343
I don't know. He just...

516
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,430
He never got to hear it.

517
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,270
I just want a fucking cup of coffee...

518
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,190
and a cigarette.

519
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,068
Sit on a stoop in the sun...

520
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,365
in the mornin' before the city gets loud.

521
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:44,494
What about you, Homer?

522
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,748
Take my son places I've never been.

523
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:53,170
See things together for the first time.

524
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:57,257
Like, uh, the pyramids,
or the Northern Lights.

525
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,303
I'd swim.

526
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,723
In a pool or a lake?

527
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:05,808
I don't know, a lake maybe.

528
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,520
It doesn't really
make a difference. I'm...

529
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,271
not very good at it anymore.

530
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:15,025
I just like the feeling
of being surrounded

531
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:17,027
by something other than the dark.

532
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,116
What's it sound like, Rachel?

533
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,494
The song for your brother.

Thanks.

552
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,708
Oh... I needed that.

553
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,463
Is your hair different?

554
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,093
Hmm? Are you doing your hair differently?

555
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:51,848
Well, it looks nice like that.

556
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,770
All right, that's enough for today.

557
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:06,071
What did you do to August?

558
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,823
Hmm?

559
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,409
What happens after the gas?

560
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,245
Oh, that's my part of it.

561
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,582
Don't you worry about it.
The gas is so you...

562
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,167
You don't have to worry.

563
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,963
Look, Prairie, all great work...

564
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,340
important work, comes at great cost.

565
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:33,682
Run, Prairie, run!

566
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,767

[banging continues]

00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:06,900
[in English] Oh, ma'am. Please, stop.

12
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,860
I don't understand a word you're saying.

13
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,612
In English. Who are you?

14
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,198
Granddaughter missing! No come home.

15
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,700
No text. Need help.

16
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,160
I sent you email.

17
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,703
We email.

18
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,290
- You detective?
- Yeah. I told you to call the police.

19
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,043
- Did you call the police?
- No. No police.

20
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,961
Michelle invisible.

21
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,088
She's what?

22
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,923
[panting] Invisible.

23
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,635
Are you Vietnamese?

24
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,641
All right.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,397
[grunts]

26
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,193
Wait there. Don't go inside.

27
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,249
Duke!

28
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,210
Duke!

29
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:10,630
Yo, Duke!

30
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,009
Didn't you surf in Vietnam for a year?

31
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,513
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you speak any Vietnamese?

32
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,807
Maybe.

33
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,809
Come.

34
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,941
Just ask her why she didn't go
to the police, like I told her.

35
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,153
[speaking Vietnamese]

[woman speaking Vietnamese]

37
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,201
[in English] She says her granddaughter
Michelle is invisible.

38
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,370
Uh-huh. What's that mean?

39
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,999
[both speaking Vietnamese]

40
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,340
[in English] Uh, they're homeless.
They're immigrants.

41
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,302
And she says that police don't give a shit,
which I'm sure is true.

42
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,430
If they're homeless, how does she know
her granddaughter didn't come home?

43
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,265
[Duke speaking Vietnamese]

[woman speaking Vietnamese]

45
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,949
[in English] They're from Michigan.
Michelle's father disappeared, maybe died.

46
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,035
[sighs] They were evicted,
finished up in a shelter,

47
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,870
and Michelle's been sending
her grandma money.

48
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,748
Getting it how?

49
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,376
[Duke speaking Vietnamese]

50
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,255
[woman speaking Vietnamese]

51
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,469
[in English] Michelle's been getting money
from her father.

52
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,930
I don't what that means,
but it doesn't sound good.

53
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,140
[speaking Vietnamese]

54
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,444
[in English] So, the kid, Michelle,
takes off for San Francisco

55
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,321
because the money's better here.

56
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,865
She's sending more money,
texting all the time,

57
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,867
then two weeks ago, it just stops.

58
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,371
There's no more money, no more texting.
Grandma waits and then...

59
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,498
[both speaking Vietnamese]

60
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,834
[in English] Then she gets on a bus
and comes here.

61
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,796
Show me the texts.

62

64
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,555
[man] Can you read that?

65
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,432
No.

66
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,979
[speaking Vietnamese]

67
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,484
[woman in English]
Very good. Fast. Best.

68
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,778

70
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,074
[in English] Karim?

71
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,828
She wants to know if you'll help look
for her granddaughter.

72
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,706
She got any money?

73
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,500
[speaking Vietnamese]

74
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,591
- [in English] What is that?
- [woman] Ether.

75
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,887
What's ether? Is that some kind of, like,
digital currency? Is it like a bitcoin?

76
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,973
[both speaking Vietnamese]

77
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,103
[in English] She was getting it
on her phone.

78
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,022
It's basically virtual money, but...
[sighs]

79
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,525
...it says here she's got $31,000.

80
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,194
Then why is she homeless?

81
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,946
[Duke speaking Vietnamese]

82
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,285
[woman speaking Vietnamese]

83
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:31,164
[in English] Ah, she got it from Michelle,
just before she vanished.

84
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,249
[inhales sharply]

85
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,461
Ask her if she wants to know the truth.

86
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,297
Go ahead, ask.

87
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,218
[speaking Vietnamese]

88
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,931
[Duke in English]
Yes, she does.

89
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,813
You tell her most girls under 18
who go missing for 72 hours

90
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,648
are never found again
or they're found dead.

91
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,318
I can't say that.

92
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,321
I'm saying it. You're translating.
Don't sugarcoat it.

93
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:05,907
Tell her.

94
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,159

[speaking Vietnamese]

96
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,846
[in English] You look.

97
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,727
You look.

98
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,691
[Karim sighs]

99
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,240
[Karim] I know you can do your job.

100
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,368
I'm just asking you to double check,
because they might not have done theirs.

101
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,538
And what about the East Bay?

102
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,174
Is that a morgue or hospitals?

103
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,345
Yeah, because I'm getting paid.

104
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,681
Listen.

105
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,100
If she were a blonde girl
from Mill Valley,

106
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,810
the police would be doing it.

107
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,230
All right, great, thank you. I owe you.

108
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,761
[both speaking Vietnamese]

109
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:03,316
[in English] She says very kind of us to
take care of her granddaughter. In fact...

110
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,400
we did very little.

111
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,736
[both speaking Vietnamese]

112
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,739
[in English]
I need you to wait outside.

113
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,867
[both speaking Vietnamese]

114
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,579
[in English]
She says she must be here.

115
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,836
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
We had a misunderstanding.

116
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,922
[whimpering]

117
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:26,839
Mr. Karim.

118
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,175
- Mr. Karim!
- [door opens]

119
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,428
You stay, I go!

120
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,681
Well, I want you on the street, okay?

121
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:40,352
Not here, listening at the door
with your better-than-you-let-on English.

122
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,438
And give me your phone.

123
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,565
Give me your phone.

124
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,532

[both chattering indistinctly]

126
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,919
[in English] It couldn't have been easy
for you guys to...

127
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,337
Taking a stranger here.

128
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,632
The church asked who can give shelter
to Mrs. Vu's granddaughter.

129
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,592
But we both work. Long days.

130
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,345
Our son studies hard.

131
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,558
You know, her grandmother says
Michelle sent her money.

132
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,560
Made it with her phone.
You know how she did that?

133
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,814
- Was she hustling?
- What is hustling?

134
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,857
[Karim] Was she selling her body?

135
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,359
This is a Christian home!

136
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,903
Yeah, well, Christians get desperate
sometimes.

137
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,196
[woman] She was not like that.

138
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,534
She was very shy, always on her phone.
She tried not to be any trouble.

139
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,829
She did the dishes
even when she didn't eat here.

140
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,539
Where did she eat?

141
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,168
Can I see where she slept?

142
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,508
This is all she had?

143
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,222
Did she give you any money?

144
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,183
Fifty dollars. Twice.

145
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,477
- For food.
- And rent, of course.

146
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,439
Can you translate these texts for me?

147
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,816
From Michelle to Mrs. Vu.

149
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,156

I want to come home.

151
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,702
But I'm afraid that's not possible.

152
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,248
Maybe one day I will have enough money
to get us a house again."

[Karim] Mrs. Vu?

157
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,434
Here.

158
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,895
Go back upstairs.
You'll sleep there, okay?

159
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,356
I'll call you when I know more.

160
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,066
Come on.

Hey. Hey, what's your name?

Your Vietnamese name.

I don't use it.

166
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,728
What do you use?

167
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,313
Donald.

168
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,821
What did you wanna tell me?

169
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,117
Did you want to show me something?

170
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,433
[Karim] No one's lived here
for a while, huh?

171
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,493
Did she sleep here sometimes
so she could be alone?

172
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,542
- What about the construction crew?
- They never come.

173
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,340
Did she bring boyfriends here?

174
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,052
She was hanging out with older kids.
They were playing a game.

175
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,763
- What kind of game?
- A game on the phone.

176
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,725
- Did you play it with her?
- I tried. I'm not smart enough.

177
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,186
[Karim] You're not smart enough?

178
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,987
When was the last time you were here?

179
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,021
She liked it to be quiet,
so she could think.

180
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,345
Fuck.

181
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,889
You thought she was doing bad things.

182
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,390
She wasn't.

183
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,893
- How'd she get her money...
- [shutter clicks]

184
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,977
...that she gave your mom?

185
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,395
[Donald] From the game.

186
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,147
What, a hundred bucks?

187
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,357
More.

188
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,318
Thirty-one thousand bucks?

189
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,195
Maybe.

190
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,154
From a game?

191
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,199
[wind swooshing]

192
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,179
Is this hers?

193
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,432
What's the game called?

194
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,018
She said the game didn't have a name.

195
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,853
So you don't talk about it.

196
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,779
Do you know the code?

197
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,281
I won't look.

198
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,000
Is that the game?

199
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:42,918
Let me see.

Hey.

00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,531
- Hey.
- [man] I've solved them myself.

204
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,576
- I've solved everything.
- [Karim] Hey.

205
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,994
I'm not going to hurt you, okay?

206
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,954
I'm just coming closer.

[sighs] My brain can hold all the brains.
My thoughts can dry water.

209
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,174
I've seen a million versions of myself.

210
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,551
You look like you need help, bro.

211
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,219
Wanna eat something?

212
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,096
Get some sleep.

213
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,099
These are mine. I did this.

[Donald] Is he okay?

Look.

219
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,839
I... I want you to go
straight to school, okay?

220
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,133
Don't talk to anyone about this.

221
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,803
I'm gonna come
and talk to your parents tonight.

I'm gonna find Michelle.

All right?

00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,895
[siren blaring]

226
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,189
[man 1] So, the kid just... jumped?

227
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,733
- He wasn't pushed?
- No.

228
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,528
And you were in the house
looking for this missing Vu girl?

229
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,570
As I said.

230
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,155
"As I said."

231
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,074
Isn't finding missing kids our job?

232
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:37,991
Yeah.

233
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,911
And since I cost money and you don't,
why'd the grandmother come to me?

234
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,663
So she could pay somebody to give a shit.

235
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,331
Exactly.

236
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:45,916
[tongue clicks]

237
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:49,461
Why didn't they find an Asian, Karim?
Don't they not like blacks?

238
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,883
Um, we've been seeing a new strain of meth
on the streets, very toxic.

239
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,845
- Did the jumper appear...
- We checked his teeth. He wasn't a user.

240
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,097
You're working real hard
to give this guy an out.

241
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,182
Why don't you just kiss him
and make it official?

Rob, you wanna take a walk around
the block? Maybe cool the fuck down?

Seriously, you think
this kid was on something?

00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,452
[Karim] Yeah, but I don't know what.

245
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,415
Who do you think owns this house?

246
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,209
- Someone with a lot of money to waste.
- Uh-huh.

247
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,009
Can I go now?

Nah, you're gonna need to come downtown
and make a statement.

That's fine.

Oh, that's fine, is it?

251

See, that's exactly why Rob doesn't
like you, Karim, you arrogant prick.

It's really about getting here.

00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,281
That's why we all come.

326
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,207
How much can you make
playing Symphony, Fola?

327
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,125
[Fola] Well, there are five levels.

328
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,169
Level one, it's 50 bucks.

329
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,005
Level two, 500. Level three, 5,000.

330
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,174
- [Karim] How many people do that?
- Not many.

331
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,092
You?

332
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,178
- And they really pay?
- Yeah, yeah, in ether.

333
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,556
- They want people to keep playing.
- Why?

334
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,560
Level four is $50,000.

335
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:06,106
I don't know anyone who's made it
that far, except for maybe Michelle.

336
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,774
Level five is a million.

337
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,612
Here. Now that you have the puzzle
on your phone,

338
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,447
and I've gotten you to this level...

339
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,533
solve it.

340
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,204
"Above the sea, below the stars."

341
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,248
Five-letter word.

342
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,709
[cell phone chimes]

343
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,675
Augmented reality.

344
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,052
There's hidden images in the stairs.

345
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,812
Yeah, I gotta find the patterns
that fit the clue.

346
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:53,987
[bird twittering]

347
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,655
Birds.

[vibrating]

349
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,789
I, uh, forgot to mention.

350
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,668
You only have three tries.
Then you gotta wait a week to try again.

351
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,548
[sighs]

352
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,885
Back at the house,
the kids were working together,

353
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,762
but you say the game doesn't like that.

354
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,930
Yeah, well, ultimately, a puzzle

355
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,683
is a conversation
between the player and the maker.

356
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,728
The puzzle maker
is teaching you a new language.

357
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,563
How to escape the limits
of your own thinking

358
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,815
and see things you didn't know were there.

359
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,983
Sounds like God.

360
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,818
Except it's real.

361
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,113
[Karim] What's above the sea
and below the stars?

362
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,241
Above the sea, below the stars.

363
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,663
Above the sea, below the stars.

364
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:47,999
Oh, wait.

365
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:03,807
It's planes.

366
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,351

what am I not seeing?

370
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,407
Above the sea, below the stars,

371
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,492
- runway...
- You only get one more go.

372
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,494
You're not gonna help me?

373
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,747
[airplane passing]

374
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,394
It's not planes.

375
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,563
But a specific plane,

376
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,148
five letters.

377
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,775

[Karim chuckles]

380
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,461
Now you know... how good it feels.

381
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,297
What do you think of the clue?

382
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:18,798
"Three wise, man?"

383
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,307
This is as far as you got and you want
a fresh brain to help you solve it.

384
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,142
No. I want you to fall in love.

385
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,022
Yeah. Like this kid fell in love?

386
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,401
Liam was always unstable, okay?

387
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,613
You try to... climb a mountain,
some people are gonna fall off.

388
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,990
- Did Michelle fall?
- No, I think she won.

389
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,825
I think she solved the game.

390
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,660
Where's she now?
Why didn't she call her grandma?

391
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,497
- Her grandma doesn't matter anymore.
- What happens if you solve the puzzle?

392
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,208
The people who can answer that question
are the ones who've done it.

393
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:55,919
Or the person who built it.

[Nina in Russian]
<i>Yes, you betrayed me.</i>

We need to spend some time together.

Come, sit and talk with me.

We'll figure out a way
to move forward together.

408

You are my partner in all things.

I am coming.

410

But I'm telling you now,
I'm not your partner anymore.

00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:10,853
What is that?

488
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,521
Oh, it'll help calm you.

489
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,650
Oh, no, I don't... I don't need any drugs.
I have to be able to think.

490
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,736
Well, it's standard procedure
for all incoming patients like yourself.

491
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,613
- It's okay.
- No, no, I don't want any.

492
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,865
Combative patient, 5150!

493
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,869
Let me go!

494
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,830
- Hold her.
- [grunting, groaning]

495
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,292
No!

496
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,560
[chattering indistinctly]

497
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,239
[cheering]

498
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,701
[Karim] Level five's a million bucks.

499
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,246
- [man] A million bucks? No fucking way.
- I swear to God, man.

500
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,958
A homeless girl had over 30 grand.
Not from sex.

501
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,087
Come on, man, you assholes
know about apps. What is this shit?

502
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,923
- It sounds like a recruitment tool.
- But with that kind of payoff?

503
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,675
For a tech company to get a great hire
or solve a big problem,

504
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,427
30K is peanuts. It's meaningless.

505
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,763
- A million is meaningless.
- Yeah, but why not call Grandma?

506
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,098
'Cause she's driving a Maserati

507
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,850
and getting more pussy and dick
than she knows what to do with.

508
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,436
- Who needs Grandma?
- Trust me, man. This kid would call.

509
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,397
- I thought you never met her.
- I met the grandma.

510
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,733
- God, 30k?
- 30k.

511
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,402
36k.

512
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:08,739
Hey, hey, hey.

513
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,575
Who's it really paying you to be here?

514
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,620
This whole PI thing
is a cover for corporate espionage?

515
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,544
- Anyone can load pics on their phone.
- Yeah?

516
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:25,714
But only some self-styled Pied Piper
can create an app that disappears the kid.

517
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,342
You think someone designed this app
to kidnap your kid?

518
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,094
Yeah, it's my working theory.

519
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:34,557
What if the app isn't a recruitment tool?
What if it's about crowdsourcing?

520
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,434
What? Erase the boundary
between work and play,

521
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,602
- hide your sweatshop in the cloud?
- Exactly.

522
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,230
But why? What's this invisible
labor force accomplishing?

523
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,149
- Or trying to accomplish?
- I don't know.

524
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,401
Which is why this whole thing
smells like Pierre Ruskin.

525
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,154
- Is that Ruskin the rideshare guy?
- [scoffs]

526
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,447
"The rideshare guy."

527
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,657
More like
“the holy prophet of the valley.”

528
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,201
He saw ridesharing before it happened.

529
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,579
He was the angel investor
for both Uber and Lyft,

530
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,497
plus six other earth-shattering things.

531
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,166
Blockchain, cryptocurrency.

532
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,167
- Ether?
- Yep.

533
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,378
And with his first company,
Ruskin didn't hire a soul.

534
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,922
Just posted a prize
on some obscure message board.

535
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,884
Five grand
for the best low-cost carbon panel.

536
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,888
Overnight, 200 people working for him
without a soul on payroll.

537
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,931
How do you know all this?

538
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,810
'Cause I won the five grand
for the best carbon panel...

539
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,312
and his name was on the check.

540
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,064
Thank you.

541
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,733
You want to thank me?

542
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,443
Forget my name.

543
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,653
I don't know your name.

544
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:30,988
Perfect.

545
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:39,997
Hey.

546
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,541
I need an address.

547
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:44,919
Pierre Ruskin.

548
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,967
[woman] I'll tell her that you're waiting.

549
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,052
[Karim] Please.

550
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,387
[keypad beeping]

551
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,099
[door closes]

552
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,730
[woman] Nina, your boyfriend is here.

553
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,816
- Homer?
- [woman] He's very anxious to see you.

554
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,610
[Tina] And he's handsome.

555
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,653
I don't know that man.

556
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,489
- I'm in love, so if you don't want him...
- Tina!

557
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,074
It's Pierre Ruskin.

558
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:18,452
I mean, I don't want him
to see me this way.

559
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,829
Would you like me
to tell him something for you?

560
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,457
Just... that I need time.

561
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,501
Okay.

562
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,379
- More for me.
- Don't say that.

563
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,715
Morning, Nina.

564
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,887
I've got good and bad news.

565
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,014
- [Pierre] That's what she said?
- Which one first?

566
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,474
[woman 2] Sir, calm down.

567
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:41,725
<i>Calm down.</i>

568
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,185
[Pierre] Tell her that I know
what she's up to.

569
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,270
[woman 2] I'm sorry, sir.

570
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,147
[Pierre] I know exactly what she's doing.

571
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,399
I'll be back.

572
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,150
Bad.

573
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:54,405
I ran a check on Homer Roberts.
I didn't find anything in St. Louis.

574
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,699
There are two in Northern California.

575
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,245
A psychiatrist in the Bay Area
and a man in his 60s in Sacramento.

576
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,876
But the good news is, we finally
got in touch with your other contact,

577
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,670
and she's waiting to talk to you.

578

Mom! Can you see me? It's Prairie.

00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,234
Nina.

00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,402
[woman] <i>Hi, Nina.</i>

584
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,322
<i>They told me that you lost your memory</i>

00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,282
<i>and that I might be able to help you.</i>

You don't know me?

<i>I'm sorry, darling, I... I don't.</i>

589
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,503
Oh.

590
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,174
I... I didn't ever live with you?

591
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,800
So, you didn't adopt?

592
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,136
<i>I...</i>

593
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,846
<i>I did adopt.</i>

594
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,556
Um...

595
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,516
<i>I have a son.</i>

596
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,018
A son?

597
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,522
Oh, my God.

598
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,609
You adopted the baby boy.

599
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,277
From Zoya.

600
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,321
<i>What?</i>

601
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:21,325
You chose the baby boy from Zoya,
in Sheepshead Bay.

602

<i>Who are you?</i>

[sighs]

604
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,208
I... I'm trying to figure that out.

605
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:33,128
My aunt, she ran a whorehouse
in Sheepshead Bay...

Wait, I don't wanna cause you
any trouble.

608
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,426
I just need to know if...

609
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,722
When you went to the orphanage,
was there a little Russian girl there,

610
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,474
age eight, blind?

I'm so...

who you're looking for.</i>

00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:10,708

623
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,594
I have to tell you something hard.

624
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,682
They want to monitor you
for another 14 days.

625

[sighs]

626
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,980
I can't stand another day in this place.
I am not crazy.

627
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,732
I am just confused.

628
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,067
I understand,
but when you threatened the nurse in...

629
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,444
- In self-defense.
- I know.

630
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,947
But that's not how they see it.
They were trying to help you.

631
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,699
Stay with me.

632
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,034
Instead of going into a psych ward,

633
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,954
you can volunteer yourself
for a 14-day stay

634
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,373
at a private clinic on Treasure lsland.

635
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:55,586
It's rare that a bed opens up there.
Someone's pulled some strings for you.

636
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,923
We can even stop by your apartment
and collect a few things together.

637
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,676
And if I say no?

638
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:07,181
It's a 14-day hold. There is no “no.”

639
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,183
It's either-or.

640
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:15,105
- Would I have access to the Internet?
- Patients have rec room time, yes.

641
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,775
And I'd be left alone, to think?

642
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,820
It'll be like a vacation,
away from the insanity of this world.

643
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,450
The clinic.

644
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,285
Good.

645
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,665
You just need to sign here.

646
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,059
Please. Let me, Ms. Azarova.

00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,007
I live here?

650
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,885
Yes, you do.

651

[bird chirps]

653
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:35,787
After the 14-day hold,
I can come be here?

654
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,331
Sleep here?

655
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,583
It's your penthouse.

656
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,085
So, yes.

657
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,756

That's me!

660
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,949
It's from the first day of school
in Moscow. I remember this.

661

[gasps]

662
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,879
I don't know any of these moments.

663
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,552
Papa.

664
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,014
But he's so old. He's...

665
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,392
He's an old man.

666

[sighs]

667
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:48,485
She's had so much time with him.

668
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,656
Can we call him?

669
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,908
I tried to contact him...

670
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,661
when I was first assigned to your case.

671
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,082
He recently passed away.

672
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:06,837
How did he die?

673
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,219
You can tell me. I can handle it.

674
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:18,932
He was shot...

675
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,809
while taking a bath.

676
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,154
You don't remember?

[tongue clicks]

678
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:36,700

[chuckles]

680
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,251
This one's Valari.

681
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,545
We were in school together.

682
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,758
She was my best friend in Russia,

683
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,593
when I was a kid.
[sniffles]

684
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,433
They all died in a bus accident.

Oh, my God.

687
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:20,994
She isn't blind.

688
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,500
Is there any record of blindness
in Nina's chart?

689
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,335
No.

690
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:32,756
Though I can understand
how you probably feel blindsided.

691
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,926
Trauma can do that to a person.

692
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:39,346
They all died in a bus accident.
She isn't blind.

693
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,557
Oh, my God.

694
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,268
Maybe...

695
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:48,647
Maybe she didn't get on the bus that day,
the day of the accident.

696
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,606
Maybe she...

697
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,526
never died and came back blind.

698
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,445
Let me help you
put a few things together in a bag,

699
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,863
so you'll be comfortable.

Where's your closet?

I have no idea.

00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:36,736
I was gonna see
if you had any sweatpants...

All right, but how many
have a prior history of mental illness?

720
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,128
Yeah, so we don't know
it's the game cracking them up.

721
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,506
Yeah, because there are

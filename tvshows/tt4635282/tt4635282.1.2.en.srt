1
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,441
Okay, my little herpetologists.

2
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,026
Let's review.

3
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,195
Warm or cold-blooded?

4
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,363
Cold!

5
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,657
- Covered in...
- Scales.

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,201
Found on every continent except...

7
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,036
Antarctica!

8
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,996
You are brilliant!

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,289
And your snakes are tired,

10
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,172
so please return them to their homes
and we'll return to our textbooks.

11
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,756
I hear your heart beating.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,094
Don't be afraid.
I know you are a good snake.

13
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,433
<i>The attack on the school bus</i>
<i>took my friends' lives...</i>

14
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,477
<i>took my sight...</i>

15
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,188
<i>but I survived.</i>

16
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,150
<i>My father wanted to keep that a secret.</i>

17
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:11,530
<i>He smuggled me out of Russia to America,
to a boarding school for the blind.</i>

18
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,407
<i>He felt I'd be safe there.</i>

19
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:19,162
<i>My maternal aunt would check in on me
and he would join me as soon as he could.</i>

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,459
<i>Until then, I had every Sunday night
to look forward to.</i>

21
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,942
Did you like it?

22
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:52,112
<i>I could find you</i>
<i>in the midst of a million violins</i>

23
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,864
<i>if you played just one note.</i>

24
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,617
<i>Maybe three notes. But no more.</i>

25
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,952
<i>How was the food this week?</i>

26
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,537
<i>Don't wrinkle your nose!</i>

27
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,921
I'll have Auntie bring you some vatrushka.

28
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,466
<i>I told my friend I would be with you soon.</i>

29
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,218
Soon. I promise.

30
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,556
I need to be careful...

31
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,852
<i>find a new home, where we'll be safe.</i>

32
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,689
<i>It's like hide-and-seek.
Right now we are hiding.</i>

33
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,024
<i>Can you stay hidden a little longer?</i>

34
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,694
Because of you, I know I can do anything.

35
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,737
<i>You can do anything.</i>

36
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,697
Nina...

37
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,909
listen carefully.

38
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,247
No one can know who you are.

39
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:49,336
You need to stop speaking Russian
until we see each other again.

40
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,504
<i>Understand?</i>

41
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,630
Yes.

42
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,051
I have one last request.

43
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,263
Play.

44
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,071
<i>He was my lifeline.</i>

45
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,614
And I was his.

46
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:20,743
Every Sunday, we saved each other.

47
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,998
We shed our skins and plotted the future.

48
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,293
I had escaped the Voi, and he would, too.

49
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,546
We'd fool everyone together.

50
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,802
<i>But then, one day, I was called down
to the headmistress' office.</i>

51
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,646
Nina, your aunt...

52
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,274
she's here because something
has happened to your father.

53
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,234
I'm so sorry.

54
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,529
Ninachka.

55
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,531
Auntie.

56
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,123
There was an accident...

57
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,542
a horrible accident.

58
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,419
Your papa is gone.

59
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,629
He isn't dead.

60
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,257
- He's in hiding from the Voi.
- Ninachka...

61
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,180
Your aunt is here
to take you to live with her.

62
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,846
I can't speak Russian.

63
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,514
I can't go with her!

64
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,517
I'm sorry, Nina.
You have to go home.

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,104
But I don't have a home
until he comes and we make one!

66
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,274
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
I know it's been good for you here.

67
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,699
<i>I felt my father was in hiding,</i>
<i>but my aunt believed he had died,</i>

68
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,035
<i>and both of our lives
had changed for the worse.</i>

69
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,289
<i>See, as long as I was in school</i>
<i>and she was watching out for me,</i>

70
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,623
<i>my father made sure money,</i>

71
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,043
<i>more money than she had ever seen
in her entire life,</i>

72
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,795
<i>flowed into her account.</i>

73
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,339
<i>For my tuition, for her attention.</i>

74
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,049
<i>But that was all done now.</i>

75
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,314
<i>What little money was left in the account</i>

76
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,346
<i>wasn't enough to cover the burden
of raising a blind child.</i>

77
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,974
Her name is Nina.
She's my niece.

78
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,684
She is fucking blind?

79
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:15,065
Be decent. Her father, my brother in-law,
a great man, just died.

80
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,865
<i>I was really lonely then.</i>

81
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,370
<i>For the first time,
my blindness felt like a prison.</i>

82
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,000
<i>It was cold where I slept.</i>

83
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,419
<i>I rarely spoke to anyone...</i>

84
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,133
<i>except for the babies,
who would come and go.</i>

85
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,426
Believe me,
that picture doesn't do him justice.

86
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,095
Beautiful.

87
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,014
How can his mother not want him?

88
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,848
She's young, a college student.

89
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,518
No, he was meant for you.

90
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,103
We're so lucky.

91
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,106
We never thought, at this point, a baby.

92
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,315
Mmm.

93
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,626
We have his room all ready.

94
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,028
Yeah, of course.
Have you brought the money?

95
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,613
Yes, Abel brought it.

96
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,659
Um, we've... been in the car all day.

97
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,662
- May I use your restroom?
- Oh, yeah, of course. It's upstairs.

98
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,877
The first door, you can't miss it.

99
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,071
What's your name, sweetheart?

100
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,365
Shh.

101
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,118
You can talk to me.

102
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,088
I'm Nancy.

103
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,016
I'm Nina.

104
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,602
Does your mom live here?

105
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,479
No, she's dead.

106
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,203
What the hell is this?

107
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,999
Do you know why I'm here?
I'm a cancer survivor.

108
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,876
Nina?

109
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,836
It's okay, I said she could.

110
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,382
Enough, Nina. Go ask Tamara
to help you with your homework.

111
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,841
She said you are behind.

112
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,385
Couldn't we take them both?

113
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,387
Nance, this... I...

114
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,431
Abel, this child is special.

115
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,642
She... she needs more than this.

116
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,771
I can imagine it's very hard.

117
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,065
It is.

118
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,108
Both her parents have passed.

119
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,276
We'll pay you.

120
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,074
Better for you to take the baby.

121
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,650
We choose her.

122
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,117
If you want her, I can't stop you.

123
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,536
You can provide for her
better than I could.

124
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,872
Only, no one should know.

125
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,624
No one would know anyway.

126
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,085
We'll change her name.
Blank slate.

127
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:49,214
We'll... we'll make her an American girl.

128
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,593
Do you... do you wanna come live with us?

129
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,802
Yes, I'd like that.

130
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,847
Oh, your eyes are blue as the prairie sky.

131
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:02,519
Prairie. That's what I'll call you.

132
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,068
Here we go, Prairie!

133
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,030
- Careful, Abel!
- Oh, she isn't going to break.

134
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,466
- Careful!
- Are you, Prairie?

135
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,284
- No.
- No? I can't hear you.

136
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,826
- No.
- I can't hear you.

137
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,204
- No!
- I can't hear you!

138
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,289
No!

139
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,625
Okay!

140
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,046
This is your new home.

141
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,840
Well, Prairie, we take off our shoes here.

142
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,218
Let me help you.

143
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,054
Okay, can I lift this foot?

144
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,557
And lift that foot.

145
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,481
Wow! How is that?

146
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,607
Good.

147
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,360
Feel all the branches on it,
and the leaves.

148
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,448
You're climbing a tree!

149
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:01,661
"'You don't know what these beans are, '
said the man to Jack.

150
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,832
'If you plant them overnight,
by morning they'll...

151
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,211
Up, up, to the sky.

152
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:13,548
And if it does not turn out to be true,
you can have your cow back.'"

153
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,008
Okay, we'll go to the next one.

154
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,239
She's sleeping.

155
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,991
She's been doing this
for a couple of weeks.

156
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,872
I'm taping it so we can show a doctor.

157
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,791
She needs a doctor, Nancy.

158
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,761
Honey! Prairie, let go. Prairie. Nina!

159
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,178
Oh!

160
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,558
Prairie believes her father's alive

161
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,811
and sneaking her messages
about where to find him in dreams.

162
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,564
She also believes her dreams
are premonitions,

163
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,941
and that the Russian Mafia are after her.

164
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:18,154
Kids tell tall tales. I did myself.

165
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:23,493
Yes, but hers are tales of grandeur
that she believes are reality.

166
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,994
Myths that make her special.

167
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,079
So what are you saying exactly?

168
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,082
Prairie's exhibiting early signs
of serious mental illness.

169
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,794
You don't happen to know
the mental history

170
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,504
of her biological parents, do you?

171
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,464
No. Um...

172
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:41,303
But I am sure that
when she's been with us for a while,

173
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,429
she's gonna be...

174
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,073
Her new stability is essential, yes,

175
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:48,393
but the best way to support her, ma'am,
is with the right mix of medication.

176
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,896
But how...
how will medication make her better?

177
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,190
I can't medicate her. She's a child!

178
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,443
- What she needs is love.
- Okay, let me be clear.

179
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,320
Untreated, she gets worse.

180
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:04,575
Blind children are
extraordinarily imaginative,

181
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,578
but this is different, okay?

182
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,496
We're dealing with a psychosis.

183
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,001
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna
get some samples. I'll be right back.

184
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:35,732
Because we've got friends and relatives
far away from here who wanna see you.

185
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:40,403
And also, I think a good mom should have
a picture of her little girl.

186
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,071
- You ready?
- Yes.

187
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,367
One, two, three.

188
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,784
There we go.

189
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,370
<i>Nina!</i>

190
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,301
Prairie, honey...

191
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,054
have one of these.

192
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:11,100
It'll make you feel better.
Okay, there you go.

193
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,895
And here's some water.

194
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,235
Good girl. You feeling better?

195
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,320
Mmm.

196
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,798
<i>Okay, how does that feel to you?</i>

197
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,574
Good. Fine, fine.

198
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,744
- Is his collar okay?
- Yeah. It's very nice.

199
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,579
I'm starting to sweat.

200
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,682
The lights are hot, sorry about that.

201
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,017
All right, this is gonna be sweet,

202
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,041
not many grandparents come in
with their grandkids.

203
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,729
She's our daughter.

204
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,922
Open mouth, insert foot. Sorry.

205
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,341
All right, everybody, relax. Looking good.

206
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:47,178
Prairie, my dear,
toward the sound my voice. Prairie?

207
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,680
Prairie,
toward the sound of my voice, honey.

208
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:50,807
Yeah, there you go.

209
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,476
<i>I was medicated for 13 years.</i>

210
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,813
<i>It made me feel numb inside.</i>

211
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,650
<i>But it didn't stop my premonitions.</i>

212
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,528
Nina!

213
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,114
Nina!

214
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,659
Nina!

215
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,570
Papa.

216
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,550
You up, sweetheart?

217
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,552
Yeah, I'm good. I'm up!

218
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,433
Let me see in the light.

219
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,435
Oh.

220
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:24,942
This time of year is...
is always hard on you.

221
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,653
Hold on.

222
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,544
Let's not tell your father.

223
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,005
<i>The medicine dulled me.</i>

224
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,132
But it didn't stop the dreams.

225
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,553
They just kept coming, for years.

226
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,138
Because they were messages
from my father,

227
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,848
reminding me that he was alive,

228
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:59,310
that he was waiting for me,
that he was calling for me.

229
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,229
Maybe you dreamed of him
because you missed him.

230
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,317
Hmm, normal dreams
don't make your nose bleed.

231
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,239
The premonitions were powerful
because I could see in them.

232
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,285
Twenty-one wax candles, my birthday.

233
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,079
That's when we were to meet.

234
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,792
The face of a giantess,
surrounded by water.

235
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,129
There's only one place that could be.

236
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,382
I made a plan to go there.

237
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,926
Wait a minute. So you just left?

238
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,930
Come on, she didn't just run away.
Right?

239
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,848
I did.

240
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,895
I knew my father was waiting for me,

241
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,648
that Nancy and Abel
would never understand.

242
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,486
A girl I knew from school
was going to Chicago.

243
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,364
I got her to give me a ride
to the Greyhound station.

244
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,866
And from there...

245
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:58,995
I disappeared.

246
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,916
Miss, we're closed.

247
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,627
I have to ask you to get on the ferry.

248
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,588
I can't, I'm waiting for someone.

249
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,215
Maybe you've seen him?

250
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:38,511
He's tall, blonde.
His hair might be gray now, or grayish.

251
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,222
No, sorry.

252
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,932
But, miss...

253
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,019
you have to get on the ferry.

254
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,738
I turned 21 today.

255
00:19:58,656 --> 00:19:59,949
Happy birthday.

256
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,912
I wondered all day what it said about her.

257
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,999
Would you read it to me?

258
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,335
Yeah. But then you have to
get on the ferry.

259
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,713
You gotta go.

260
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:21,303
"Here, at our sea-washed, sunset gates

261
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,681
shall stand a mighty woman with a torch,

262
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,810
whose flame is the imprisoned lightning,

263
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:31,147
and her name, Mother of Exiles.

264
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,819
<i>From her beacon-hand
glows world-wide welcome,</i>

265
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:43,117
<i>her mild eyes command the air-bridged
harbor that twin cities frame.</i>

266
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:50,207
<i>'Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!'
cries she with silent lips.</i>

267
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,669
<i>'Give me your tired, your poor,</i>

268
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,588
<i>your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free,</i>

269
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,925
<i>the wretched refuse of your teeming shore.</i>

270
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:06,057
<i>Send these, the homeless,
tempest-tost to me.</i>

271
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,602
<i>I lift my lamp beside the golden door!'"</i>

272
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,957
<i>I should have gone home...</i>

273
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,336
<i>but I was heartbroken and ashamed.</i>

274
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,046
<i>Too proud.</i>

275
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:45,096
<i>I didn't wanna give up,
so I devised one last plan.</i>

276
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:51,268
<i>If I couldn't see my father,
maybe he could hear me.</i>

277
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,149
I would play my violin in the underground
until he stepped off a train,

278
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,943
heard my song, and came running.

279
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,405
And do you know?

280
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,324
My plan worked.

281
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,995
But it wasn't my father who found me.

282
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,207
It was another man.

283
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,545
The man who would change my life.

284
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,314
Oh, hey, later, French.
See you tomorrow.

285
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,441
Right.

286
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,315
We haven't done that in a while.

287
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,649
Mmm.

288
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,945
We can now.

289
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,240
Your eyes...

290
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,118
they're sparkling.

291
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,166
You want breakfast in bed?

292
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,378
Well, of course I want breakfast in bed.

293
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,734
What?

294
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,528
I went on a walk.

295
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,324
Your mom and I could go with you.

296
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,536
Alone. Sometimes, I...

297
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,580
Sometimes I just need to be alone.

298
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,003
The last time you went out on your own,
you came back with dog bites.

299
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,299
And then this thing with
Steve Winchell's teacher,

300
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,551
and now you're hiding things from us.

301
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,179
Look, I know that you're trying
to keep me safe.

302
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:37,142
And I know that I let you down.
I... embarrassed you.

303
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,354
I'm sorry, but I can't...

304
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,399
I can't live cooped up
in this house all the time.

305
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,945
Maybe the doctor in St. Louis was right,
and we... we took you home too soon.

306
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,573
Maybe you need time in medical care.

307
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,259
- Please don't say that.
- Professionals...

308
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,284
Please, I'm...

309
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,915
I'm sorry that I scared you.

310
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,711
Please don't send me away.

311
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,549
If you talk to that trauma counselor,

312
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,635
the one from the FBI,
the one that keeps calling.

313
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,763
You need someone with experience.

314
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,017
- If I do, can I walk at night?
- Prairie...

315
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,063
On my own.
Just for clearing my head, not to...

316
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,606
It's not safe, Prairie.

317
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,733
One hour.

318
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,611
She can have an hour walk. Right?

319
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,075
Maybe she needs some
wide open space, Nance.

320
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:45,919
<i>Adrian.</i>

321
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,341
Here you go, bud.

322
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,760
Eat. Let's go.

323
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,184
Come on. Last bite, last bite.

324
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,907
You gotta go brush your teeth, all right?

325
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,687
I did.

326
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,647
No, you didn't. Your toothbrush was dry.

327
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,568
All right.

328
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,199
- You good?
- What?

329
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,825
You good? Everything good?

330
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,287
My butthole stinks, but yeah.

331
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:22,998
Great. We'll have the doctor
check that out for you.

332
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,755
All right.
Hey, come on. Last bite, last bite.

333
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,218
Come on, there we go, there we go.
Gotta get to the bus stop, all right?

- Mr. Harris?
<i>- Hi, Alfonso.</i>

344
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,196
<i>This is Kevin Harris
from the Knightsman Foundation.</i>

345
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,868
Uh, hi! It's, uh... it's nice to meet you.
Well, phone meet you.

346
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,036
<i>We're very impressed by you, Alfonso.</i>

347
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,581
<i>Athletics, grades, community involvement.</i>

348
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,001
<i>And your essay about bees.</i>

349
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,503
<i>Phenomenal.</i>

350
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:33,629
Bees?

351
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:37,132
<i>Oh. Oh, my mistake.</i>

352
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,010
<i>You wrote about learning CPR!</i>
<i>Sorry.</i>

353
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:44,139
<i>Anyway, we loved it
and we want to offer you the scholarship.</i>

354
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,893
<i>How's that feel?</i>

355
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,522
Wow, that's, uh... Wow.

356
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,107
<i>That's what we like to hear.</i>

357
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,027
<i>Your</i> abuela <i>will be over the moon.</i>

358
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,613
He's actually gotta get back
to class, Mr. Harris.

359
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,781
Uh, keep up those grades.

360
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,032
We'll follow up soon.

361
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,826
Uh, this means a lot to me. Thank you.

362
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,830
<i>Welcome to the Knightsman family, Alfonso.
You have a great day.</i>

363
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,417
You got it.

364
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,297
What matters is you got it.

365
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,424
It's okay. It's a lot to process.

366
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:23,512
Uh, do I need to do anything?
Like, write 'em a letter, something?

367
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,013
Just e-mail and accept.

368
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,182
There's also a dinner, always awkward.

369
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,937
And of course, carry a full course load,
uh, abide by the character clause.

370
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,647
Oh. I don't know what that means.

371
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,050
Ah, just don't do anything weird.

372
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,859
Don't get in trouble with the cops
or anything. It'll be fine.

373
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,408
Yo, you spell "Voi" with a "y" or an "i"?
I can't find anything.

374
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,453
Maybe it's with Russian letters.
Open your mind.

375
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,794
Hey. I, uh...

376
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,464
I got your text.
That bus is messed up, right?

377
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,006
Yeah. Fucked up.

378
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,844
Uh, can I... Can I sit here?

379
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,515
- Can you help us look shit up?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.

380
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,809
You gotta help us find some shit.

381
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,645
Yeah, we haven't found anything
on Nina Azarov yet.

382
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,605
Well, she was a kid.
Maybe her dad scrubbed it

383
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,566
- so she couldn't be traced.
- Mmm.

384
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,568
Uh, I'll look up "Azarov mine."

385
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,945
I mean, she said her father
had a mine, right?

386
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,197
- Yeah. Yeah, good idea.
- Mmm-hmm.

387
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,745
She trying to get you out of Asheville?

388
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,121
Fat chance.

389
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,707
But just 'cause they haven't come yet,
doesn't mean they won't.

390
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,417
Plan on talking to your parents?

391
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,543
What's Asheville?

392
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,714
Uh, it's like boot camp,
or military school.

393
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,800
- You know, for bad kids.
- Are you even trying to find anything?

394
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,469
Try some Russian shit.

395
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:53,101
Hey, you sent me that Snapchat?

396
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,812
- Oh, yeah.
- No, I don't want to look at that.

397
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,065
I know. We're tracing her story.

398
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:00,192
Like, nothing so far,
uh, except for the bus.

399
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,068
- Which is huge.
- Yeah.

400
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,326
You'll be there tonight, right?

401
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,791
That guy thinks he's the shit, doesn't he?

402
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,585
He's a fucking dick
if he doesn't come back.

403
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,928
Come sit, baby.

404
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,680
<i>Maman</i> has a headache.

405
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,438
Is something wrong?

406
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:40,732
No, no, actually,
uh, I have good news.

407
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,777
- Ah?
- Really good news.

408
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:48,449
- I got the call today, from that trust.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh?

409
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,492
And I got the scholarship.

410
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,788
I can go to any school in Michigan,
for free.

411
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,123
So you don't have to worry about anything.

412
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,337
Nothing, <i>Maman.</i> Not even a cent.

413
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,382
So you're done with Harvard?

414
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,304
Uh, well, I...
I haven't heard back from them.

415
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,766
But this is an option, a really good one.

416
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,977
I just want the best for you, baby.

417
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,107
We'll make it without you...

418
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,277
By the skin of our teeth, we will.

419
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,424
Well, I can drive down some weekends,

420
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,615
and we can go to Carlos'
baseball games together.

421
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,451
Baby, you know I can't go
to those things in my condition.

422
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,011
If you really feel like
you have a condition,

423
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,996
you should let me take you to the doctor.

424
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,622
See?

425
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,253
What am I going to do without you
worrying about me all the time, huh?

426
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,800
Well, that's what I'm saying.
You know, I'll be close.

427
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,802
Michigan.

428
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,351
I'm proud of you.

429
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,356
And you deserve
everything in the world...

430
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,817
and more.

431
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,279
<i>Merci, Maman.</i>

432
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,117
A favor, my star?

433
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,453
Pick up milk?

434
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,706
I can't have my coffee
in the morning without it.

435
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,375
Yeah. Sure.

436
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,132
Hey, hey, French. Hey!

437
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,635
Hey.

438
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,469
Yeah, I thought I saw you there.

439
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,182
So I... I like cold stuff in the cold.

440
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,265
Cool.

441
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,813
You're bringing milk?
That's... that's weird.

442
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,731
Oh, no, uh, I'm not going.

443
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:53,073
You're worried being at the house with her
will mess up getting into college, right?

444
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,868
Yeah, well, I just got a scholarship,
actually. Full ride.

445
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:58,495
Wow.

446
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,997
If anyone would, it would be you.

447
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,211
You know, my parents
kind of want me to be you. It's...

448
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,255
- Really?
- Yeah.

449
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:13,051
Uh, first they wanted me
to be Christine Yee, but...

450
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,725
There's a character clause
for the scholarship?

451
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:23,144
I mean, I know they have one
for the Mabel Allen.

452
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,772
Wow, you know your shit.

453
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,859
Yeah, it's like...

454
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,988
they think people like us will just
slide into being criminals

455
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,281
unless they specifically prohibit it.

456
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,575
You gotta read up.

457
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:40,662
Yeah. If I'm caught at a house
with drug deals, it's over, you know?

458
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,746
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's different for someone like Steve.

459
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,207
He's fucking his own life up.

460
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:47,544
And I'm just trying not to fall into
the default of getting my life fucked.

461
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:49,504
Well, if that makes sense.

462
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,964
No, that makes sense.

463
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,133
It's just...

464
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,136
Aren't you curious
as to how it ends?

465
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,347
- What, her story?
- Mmm.

466
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,891
No, I... I don't really care.

467
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,809
Her story, but...

468
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,186
Us.

469
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,108
I mean, don't you think that...
she picked us for some reason?

470
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:19,242
Like, Steve's probably a murderer, and,
uh, Jesse's totally checked out of life,

471
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:22,621
and Ms. Broderick-Allen is weird and sad,

472
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:26,082
and I'm... well, you know.

473
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,584
I don't need help.

474
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,797
- No, I know, I wasn't...
- No, I do everything on my own.

475
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,717
I know. I...

476
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,515
Yeah. Well, I gotta get this back
in non-ice cube form. So...

477
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,059
Okay.

478
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,996
Damn it.

479
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,666
Buck!

480
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,501
Buck!

481
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,387
Come on, let's go.

482
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,901
Oh, that's cool.

483
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,654
Got fucking frostbite last night.

484
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,954
If we're gonna keep doing this,
you can't deal outta here.

485
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,414
What's it to you?

486
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,458
You just can't.

487
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,213
Guys, OA said we only have an hour.

488
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,049
- Let's not waste time.
- Whatever, man.

489
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,136
But that means your supply
is cut, too, Buck.

490
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,637
Including the testosterone.

491
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,825
I can tell you everything
that I did wrong.

492
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,575
I didn't eat when I was hungry.

493
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,535
Didn't sleep when I was tired.

494
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,370
Didn't get warm when I was cold.

495
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,704
It made me weak.

496
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,959
But the biggest mistake I made
was believing

497
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,836
that if I cast a beautiful net...

498
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,964
I'd catch only beautiful things.

499
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,479
Your music, it's...

500
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,316
Russian, yes?

501
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,278
Are you Russian?

502
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,531
Me? No. I'm American.

503
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,615
Hap...

504
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,536
...is my name.
Dr. Hunter Aloysius Percy,

505
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,330
so, Hap for short.

506
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,041
Can I... Can I help you with something?

507
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,250
No, no, no.

508
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,004
Can I ask you something?

509
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,465
I'm sorry, I'm late. I have to go.

510
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,425
Did you always play that well?

511
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,219
Or did something happen to you?

512
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,698
It did, didn't it?
Something happened to you and then you,

513
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:36,142
then you could play...
transcendently like that.

514
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,605
Did... I'm sorry.
Did... did you have an NDE?

515
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,814
I don't know what that is.

516
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,233
Uh, a near-death experience.
Did you die?

517
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,444
Then come back to life?

518
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:05,130
- You okay with lemon?
- Yeah.

519
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,548
All right. Here we go.

520
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,259
You take this, put it up to your mouth,

521
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,677
and you just slurp the oyster down

522
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,763
like you're sucking sea water
out of a shell.

523
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,767
Oh.

524
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,398
All right, I hated my first one, too.

525
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,650
Uh, can we get some fries, please?

526
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,333
But everything good in this world takes,

527
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,712
uh, getting used to.

528
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,822
Right, I remember my first coffee
in college.

529
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,051
I wanted to throw up.
But by the end of medical school,

530
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,077
I couldn't get out of bed
without a double shot.

531
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,621
That's a lot of school for someone
who said they hated it.

532
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,582
Well, I didn't... I just didn't understand

533
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,960
why I wasn't supposed to ask the questions
that had no answers.

534
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:47,213
They're the most interesting questions,
aren't they?

535
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,673
What is consciousness?

536
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:53,678
Where does consciousness go after...
you know, after this place?

537
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,761
Hmm.

538
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,889
But you know. Right?

539
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,058
I mean, when you were...

540
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:01,769
Let me ask you a question,
when you returned after dying, was that...

541
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,023
Did you feel like that was a choice?

542
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,192
- You experienced it as a choice?
- Yeah.

543
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,859
Wow. Wow.

544
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,529
You called it a near-death experience?

545
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,697
- Yeah.
- So you had one?

546
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,034
Uh, here, ketchup at midnight,

547
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,494
mustard at four o'clock,
mayo at eight o'clock.

548
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,955
Good stuff, okay?

549
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,916
Did I have an NDE? No.

550
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,252
I didn't, but I, uh...

551
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:31,924
It's pretty much all I...
Well, it is all I think about.

552
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,468
What my life's about.

553
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:40,266
So I was an anesthesiologist in the ER,
and the first time I heard... uh...

554
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,727
a patient flat-line, I thought...

555
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:47,440
like, I almost heard... something.

556
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,900
You know? Something...

557
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,944
I don't know. Something.

558
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,258
So I went to this bunch of doctors,
summoned my courage.

559
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,343
I asked them, they're like,

560
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:59,869
"Eh, yeah, everybody thinks
they feel something."

561
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,997
No, I heard... a whoosh...

562
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,627
of something leaving the body,

563
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,422
and the whoosh... of it coming back.

564
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:19,054
Now if they came back,
it means they went somewhere.

565
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,641
Where did they go?

566
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,274
We could prove that.

567
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:32,860
Wow.

568
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:37,157
I... I did what any reasonable scientist
would do.

569
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,493
I walked away from the ER
and I started what has become

570
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:45,790
a... a lifetime of study of,
uh, NDE survivors.

571
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,001
So you know people like me.

572
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,630
Yeah.

573
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,759
Yeah, well, I'm... I'm doing a study
right now with three people just like you.

574
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,137
Well, one of them is
particularly like you.

575
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,723
She came back with, uh,
special skills, musical ability.

576
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,099
Like, what is that?

577
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:08,271
Perfect pitch, in her case,
but there are others I've met who've...

578
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,897
People come back with, uh,

579
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,444
mathematical or artistic, or, you know,
um... linguistic abilities.

580
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,279
It's... It's...

581
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,947
That's not what makes them amazing.

582
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,074
What makes you incredible...

583
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:25,163
is that you have traveled outside this...

584
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,457
...coma...

585
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,710
that we're all in.

586
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,003
You know?

587
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,090
Ever since I left Russia,

588
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:39,260
the only thing I've thought about
every day is how to find my father.

589
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,888
And he was the only person
who never made me feel like

590
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,640
I was demented or...

591
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:45,850
No, of course not.

592
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,394
You should never have been medicated.

593
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,270
Never.

594
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,274
Why, because you're...
you have vivid dreams?

595
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:54,900
That's insane.

596
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,781
Sorry, this is so strange to hear that...

597
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,826
I am weird, but that you like weird.

598
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,203
No, weird is good.

599
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:10,124
I mean, there's some pathetically
ordinary guy somewhere

600
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,018
wearing a T-shirt with that
emblazoned on the front:

601
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,753
"Weird is good."

602
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,014
I have to go.

603
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,892
Can I get the check, please?

604
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:32,522
I have to fly home tonight,
get back to work.

605
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:33,939
Um...

606
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,610
I have something
I think you might like. Um...

607
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,612
It's kind of an offshoot of my work.

608
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:43,908
So, I was here, I sold a patent
at a conference yesterday, and...

609
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,619
- Can I show you something?
- Yeah, yeah.

610
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,120
Yeah? Okay.

611
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:51,707
Here.

612
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,918
Okay, let's get this stuff out of the way.

613
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:59,549
So, like I said, a lot of it is about
trying to hear the whoosh, okay?

614
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:04,345
I'm just gonna put that right in there.

615
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,180
Okay, is that in?

616
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:14,522
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

617
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,106
All right, now...

618
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:19,193
You switch it on down there.

619
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:24,532
This can make a heartbeat audible
at 500 feet.

620
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,535
- Just press this?
- Uh-huh.

621
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,011
That! She's move... Someone's moving.

622
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:46,220
Yeah.

623
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,936
Younger maybe? Like a kid?

624
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,896
Absolutely, absolutely.

625
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:01,110
You know, a heartbeat is...
is more unique even than a fingerprint.

626
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,362
Here, try this.

627
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,544
- Wow!
- Yeah.

628
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,270
That's what you sound like.

629
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,107
That's what I sound like.

630
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:49,700
Take me with you.

631
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,495
Study me.

632
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,456
Are you sure?

633
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:04,549
How long?

634
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,968
No headwinds. Just a few hours.

635
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,183
Put your hands to the right.
There's a window there.

636
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:18,354
Pull it. Okay, slide it down and back.
There's a latch in the middle.

637
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:23,067
Keep going, there you go,
and pull it up and over and back.

638
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,612
Up and over and back, all the way.
Push the window.

639
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,532
Push, go on.

640
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:54,724
Okay, here we are.

641
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,480
Glad I left the heat on. I don't know
what you would've thought of me

642
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,523
if you walked into a freezing house.

643
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:10,490
Oh, there's a bed downstairs in the lab,
hope that's okay.

644
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,538
It's so quiet.

645
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,000
There aren't any roads nearby?

646
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,461
Uh, that and there's
insulated glazing on every window.

647
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,130
The winters here are brutal.

648
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,508
Glass of water.

649
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:31,510
Can I use your phone,

650
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:33,888
just to call my parents
and tell them I'm okay?

651
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,515
Yeah, sure.

652
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:42,229
Here, let me take that.

653
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:49,153
And, uh, there's a chair
right behind you now. Okay.

654
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,824
- You want help to dial?
- Oh, no.

655
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,117
Okay.

656
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,731
<i>♪ Operator ♪</i>

657
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:29,026
<i>♪ Oh, could you help me place this call? ♪</i>

658
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,740
<i>♪ See, the number on the matchbook
Is old and faded ♪</i>

659
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,744
It just keeps ringing.
They're probably on the other line.

660
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:42,081
Well, we'll call them again tomorrow.
We don't want 'em to worry.

661
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:44,375
So...

662
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,086
long day for you, must be tired.

663
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,838
- Can I show you downstairs?
- Yeah.

664
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:49,964
All right.

665
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,264
Okay, it's two sets of stairs.

666
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,015
First one's the easy one.

667
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:03,518
There's a handrail on your left.

668
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,355
Okay, got it?

669
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,400
And then there's a spiral coming up.

670
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,448
Okay. Here, you're about halfway down.

671
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:23,330
Oh... I'll take your bag.

672
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,124
Sorry.

673
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,459
Smells like rock.

674
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,254
Shale.

675
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,714
Here.

676
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,423
I built this lab myself.

677
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,551
Okay, there's a big step coming up.

678
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,055
Is that running water?

679
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:43,475
Yeah. It's a natural spring.
I just left it.

680
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,811
Never the same river twice, as they say.

681
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,607
And... hold on, here we are.

682
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:54,111
Okay.

683
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,614
There's a bed three steps ahead of you.
Turn around.

684
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,866
Okay.

685
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:09,669
You are an incredible asset, Prairie.

686
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:15,758
I'm... I'm so lucky that I met you,
and to be working with you.

687
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,054
Thank you.

688
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,267
You get some rest.

689
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,186
Good night.

690
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,803
Hap?

691
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:16,819
Okay, okay.

692
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,404
Let me walk you through this,

693
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:20,739
'cause I know where your head's at.

694
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,157
"This is not happening."

695
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:23,408
It is.

696
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,745
"This is a dream."

697
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,662
You are wide awake.

698
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:29,081
"Someone will find me."

699
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,626
"Why am I locked in a cage?"

700
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,840
Well... you'll find out soon enough.

701
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:42,886
Know this: It may be a while
before he comes for you.

702
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,306
And as you think about
every step that led you here,

703
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:51,645
you'll eventually realize
it's no one's fault but your own.

704
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:56,859
Your thoughts are gonna
try to take you down. Don't let them.

705
00:53:58,027 --> 00:53:59,736
You'll find your freedom.

706
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,113
In sleep.

707
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:03,282
In your dreams.

708
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,701
It's how we stay sane.

709
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,581
What's your name?

710
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:16,837
Prairie.

711
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,883
Prairie.

712
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:23,844
My name is...

713
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,514
Homer.

714
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:45,971

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,099
-You give up?
-Best of three.

3
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,120
OK, first to the quarry.

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,680

"The Deer Hunters"

8
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,799
The rooks have had a go, then.

9
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,109
Yep.

10
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,199
-Any ID?
-Yeah, driver's licence.

11
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,829
Shane Thurgood.
He's got a flat in the city centre.

12
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,780
Well, someone get over there, then.

13
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,530
So if the birds were having a go
at daybreak...

14
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,919
-time of death?
-Past peak of rigor mortis.

15
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,129
Chest split into clot and serum.

16
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,189
-So less than 24, more than 12.
-Yeah.

17
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,259
Would I be clutching at straws
to say cause of death

18
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,719
was shotgun wound to the sternum?

19
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,159
Biggish bullet to the liver,
no exit wound.

20
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,379
Soft-nosed round, then, eh?

21
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,470
-Get you!
-She told us.

22
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,750
Out here,
my money's on a hunting rifle.

23
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,830
We're looking for a cartridge,
yay big,

24
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,240
preferably with prints.

25
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,720
We'll do our best.

26
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,340
Wanna get a metal detector up here.
That'd help.

27
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,170
What about the car?

28
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,769
Well, we're trying to shift it
but the battery's gone.

29
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,160
-What, left the lights on?
-Aye, maybe.

30
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,170
So it came after dark.

31
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,470
What you got?

32
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,729
Nothing.

33
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,120
The herd have been through here.

34
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,810
Can't see bugger all.

35
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,490
There's tyre tracks up the lane from
the victim's car and the quad bikes.

36
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,100
Plus,

37
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,310
I found these house keys
in the jean pocket.

38
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,999
The quad tracks -
that's the kids, yes?

39
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,300
Yeah.

40
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,099
So the killer either travelled
with the victim...

41
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,700
..or came on his own two feet.

42
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,649
Get over yourself, man!

43
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,339
It's animal feed.
Look, soya without the latte.

44
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,719
Yeah?

45
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,270
There's a bag of those pellets
in the car boot.

46
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,470
Say he's poaching.

47
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,999
Well, poachers don't live
in the city centre.

48
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,599
He's got the feed.

49
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,550
He's luring them for an ambush.

50
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,659
All right, so say he's got a gun.

51
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,539
Someone uses it against him.

52
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,779
He's taken it from the scene,
obviously.

53
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,069
Well, it's worth a punt.

54
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,299
See if he's got a gun licence.

55
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,659
Not that that means anything.

56
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,849
And I want a thorough search
of the surrounding area.

57
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,509
Does that include Cumbria,

58
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,969
or just the half of Northumberland
we can see from here?

59
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,780
Cumbria?
Never heard of it!

60
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,099
Did you see anyone
on the way up here?

61
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,169
Farmer? Hikers?

62
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,929
I don't think so.

63
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,119
Take your time, there's no hurry.

64
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,180
It's a blur, really.

65
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,639
What did you do
when you came across the body?

66
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,009
Rang Mam.

67
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,419
-You didn't touch anything?
-No.

68
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,579
-No way.
-Good girl.

69
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,529
And you've been here ever since?

70
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,849
Yeah, till Mam got here.

71
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,410
Nearly had a heart attack
when she rang.

72
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,459
So you called us
and then came up here?

73
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,389
Yes,
I was just down the road.

74
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,440
I do breakfasts on the estate.

75
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,139
The season must be in full swing.

76
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,440
Very much so.

77
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,310
Do you recognise him at all?

78
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,149
Well, he...
lives in the village, doesn't he?

79
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,699
I know him. Shane Thurgood.
He lives at his granddad's place.

80
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,009
Right.

81
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,119
So he can give us next of kin.

82
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,759
No, granddad's passed.

83
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,869
Shane came back to do the probate,
I think.

84
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,589
-How do you mean, came back?
-He lived here as a kid.

85
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,210
Well, up till college or whatever.

86
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,850
But I can't say we were
on more than nodding terms.

87
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,460
Tyre tracks here,
at least.

88
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,520
-Lights are on.
-Left in a hurry.

89
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,340
Right. Anything that can tell us
about Thurgood's family.

90
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,269
RE: PROBATE APPLICATION
COMPLETE

91
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,920
Ma'am, you should see this.

92
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,050
The door's been forced.

93
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,880
Break-in?
It's got to be connected.

94
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,579
He's out poaching...
the killer finds him...

95
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,389
comes back here
to cover the evidence.

96
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,370
Or find something,
something they wanted.

97
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,240
Is it fur?

98
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,870
No, it's too long.

99
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,160
I think it's human hair.

100
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,249
Right, door-knocking
round the parish.

101
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,219
House-to-house, pub, post office,
if they've still got one.

102
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,179
All the usual standard questions.

103
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,139
Did they know him, what did he do,
and when did you last see him?

104
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,049
At this stage,
let's say "missing".

105
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,649
-Cos village folk believe anything?
-Kenny's right, they'll all know.

106
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,669
Here we go -
uses of hair.

107
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,859
Voodoo.
Wig-making.

108
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,309
Crop protection.
Acts as a repellent.

109
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,129
-Explains a lot, Ken.
-Against deer.

110
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,630
They won't go near anything
that smells of people.

111
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,270
So if hair repels them
and fodder attracts,

112
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,029
confuse the beast,
you've got him where you want him.

113
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,330
Right?

114
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,320
With me.

115
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,400
Here we go.

116
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,049
OK...
Joseph Thurgood.

117
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,889
Probate transfer.

118
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,699
Was Shane the only beneficiary?

119
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,009
We're trying to trace
his next of kin.

120
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,249
I'm pretty sure it was just him.

121
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,669
Obviously, Joe's son and
daughter-in-law predeceased him.

122
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,389
Shane's parents are dead?

123
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,009
Yes, collision on the A69.

124
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,100
He was nine, I think.

125
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,780
What was he like, granddad?

126
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,059
I think the polite term
is "curmudgeon".

127
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,849
Certainly not your first choice

128
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,740
to raise a bereaved child.

129
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,939
Did Shane have a partner?

130
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,189
If there was, they never came up.

131
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,339
So he was planning to live there
alone?

132
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,889
No, he said he was going to sell
it. He was pretty sure about that.

133
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,009
So did he instruct an agent?

134
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,889
He didn't need to.
Peyton's, the estate owners,

135
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,789
offered the asking
price plus 20 per cent.

136
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,349
No one else got a look in.

137
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,149
And you were negotiating the deal?

138
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,329
I was.
He pulled out.

139
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,010
-Why?
-No idea.

140
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,810
I presumed
he couldn't bear to part with it.

141
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,889
Nobby No-Mates,
as far as I can gather.

142
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,909
Well, you're not trying hard enough!

143
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,419
Beaky lot, round that way.
Come on!

144
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,699
I'm telling you. There's not even
crackpots with conspiracy theories.

145
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,450
Well, it's changed since my day.

146
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,140
Any death guaranteed
someone saying it's witchcraft.

147
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,009
So if he's got no connections,

148
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,849
is it odd he wants to stay
all of a sudden?

149
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,399
Do the place up,
open a B&B, yoga courses.

150
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,700
That's why people move these days.

151
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,619
Biggest piece of bullet I can find.

152
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,759
Disintegrated in all directions.

153
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,829
So without the cartridge, we're
screwed on the ballistics front.

154
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,430
-Pretty much.
-Well, at a wild guess?

155
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,789
High-powered .308
with a soft-nosed round?

156
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,589
He's been talking to Shep
and all, then.

157
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,769
From the damage I can
tell you dum- dum bullet,

158
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,249
so probably homemade.

159
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,179
-They're banned, aren't they?
-Not against animals.

160
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,349
What about angle of entry,
range and all that?

161
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,680
Close range, two or three feet.
Not intending to miss.

162
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,400
Don't worry,
first one's the worst.

163
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,580
Photo.

164
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,759
Where he died,
I think it's his own land.

165
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,079
Have you got details of the probate?

166
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,680
Yeah, it's just here.

167
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,490
There.

168
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,889
Yeah, it comes with
a few hundred acres of scrub.

169
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,559
Granddad's had it since the '50s.

170
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,069
If a deer comes on your land,
that's no poaching, is it?

171
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,659
Ma'am, Kenny's
inside the property in the town.

172
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,960
Will you put him through?

173
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,070
-Kenny, what's the flat like?
-Thurgood lives alone.

174
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,609
Not house proud.

175
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,069
What do the neighbours
have to say about him?

176
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,690
<i>He's a loner,
but not unfriendly.</i>

177
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,259
<i>They recognised him
at the newsagent,</i>

178
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,319
but first name turns only.

179
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,979
<i>Did they tell you anything useful,</i>
like his job?

180
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,610
<i>He claimed to be
some sort of novelist.</i>

181
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,729
<i>What, as a hobby or published?</i>

182
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,189
He had one published,
apparently.

183
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,949
But I've never heard of him.

184
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,970
Well, rules out children's books,
then, eh?

185
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,779
Mark?

186
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,420
Bank account, credit cards,
all recent transactions.

187
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,069
How was he supporting himself?

188
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,780
-And how he maintaining two properties?
-Exactly.

189
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,540
Today?

190
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,290
How far's this from the murder site?

191
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,480
It's about a mile.

192
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,910
Still warm.

193
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,039
Probably torched last night.

194
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,640
No, I'd say the night before.

195
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,380
Busy place for the middle of nowhere.

196
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,339
-Look at this.
-More animal feed.

197
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,449
Casting further afield.

198
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,309
And they shot out the tyres.

199
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,909
SOCO picked up at least
six cartridge cases.

200
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,680
Champion, just need to find one
now at the murder scene.

201
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,880
Cor, he really went to town on this,
though, didn't he?

202
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,760
It wasn't a mistake,
that's for sure.

203
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,239
Is that hiding something
or just for the craic?

204
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,149
It's not much of a trophy, is it?

205
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,920
A clapped-out set of bull bars.

206
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,489
Shep, what have you got?

207
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,489
Well, number plate's local,
registered to a Linus Campion.

208
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,129
According to the PNC,
the vehicle was reported stolen.

209
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,939
-When?
-This morning, first thing.

210
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,849
But I ran this Campion,
he's got form for twocking.

211
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,399
Insurance job.

212
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,109
So when did we last have contact
with this bloke?

213
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,800
He was brought in last year
for poaching.

214
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,750
What was that you were saying
about witchcraft?

215
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,050
Not for you, is it?

216
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,000
It's a scarecrow.

217
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,789
-Morning.
-Don't tell me, pet.

218
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,730
-Neighbourhood Watch?
-Northumberland & City CID.

219
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,219
Sorry, I thought you were
noise patrol.

220
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,340
Could you turn that down, love?

221
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,430
So which one of you
is Linus Campion?

222
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,859
What have I done now?

223
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,779
-Do you know Shane Thurgood?
-He's dead, isn't he?

224
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,999
Well,
did you know Shane Thurgood?

225
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,479
Did when I was a kid. Why?

226
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,220
-When did you last see him?
-No idea.

227
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,489
Seen him out and about on the fells
a few times but he wasn't chatty.

228
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,200
What, not chatty with you
or not chatty in general?

229
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,890
A bit of both.

230
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,780
-Did you see him Tuesday night?
-No.

231
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,339
So what were you doing?

232
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,320
Watching Thor on Netflix.
Have you seen it?

233
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,659
You selling any venison today?

234
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,510
Try your luck end of season.

235
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,119
Those crows out front.

236
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,599
-What do you shoot them with?
-A rifle.

237
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,920
-I've got a licence.
-Can I see it?

238
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,980
Chickens don't grow on trees.

239
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,619
Shut your noise, Hursty.

240
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,270
We don't want the nice lady
thinking you're daft.

241
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,280
-.308?
-Legal?

242
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,079
Do you keep it in a secure locker?

243
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,189
Most of the time.
What's this about?

244
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,199
You called about your missing truck.

245
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,509
Oh, yeah.

246
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,819
Well, we found it -

247
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,889
burnt-out, up the fell
with a stag in the back,

248
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,399
shot by a rifle just like yours.

249
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,449
-That sounds like poachers, then.
-That's what we thought.

250
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,010
When did you notice it was missing?
You only called in this morning.

251
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,359
The truck was stolen,
I reported it.

252
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,089
It's not that big a sin, is it?

253
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,539
Except your pick-up isn't insured,
Mr. Campion.

254
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,929
Nor did it have an MOT,
which is a very serious offence.

255
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:11,519
Which is why we're go continue this
conversation under caution in Newcastle.

256
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,820
Come on.

257
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,339
Right, soft lad,
a few misdemeanours.

258
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,649
Campion, on the other hand...

259
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,000
Want a lever arch or box file?

260
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,819
The vet find anything in the stag?

261
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,579
No, same story.
Not enough bullet intact.

262
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,930
And the casings around the truck
don't match their rifles. Sorry.

263
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,120
We'll take Campion first.

264
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,809
Why report it stolen?

265
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,089
I mean, no tax, no nothing.

266
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,129
You're just putting your hand up
for a driving ban.

267
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,909
No comment.

268
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,219
It's not like you don't know

269
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,949
your way around a charge sheet.

270
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,250
No comment.

271
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,880
Still, poaching just a slap
on the wrist these days, isn't it?

272
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,980
Does that mean you were worried about
getting done for something worse?

273
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,910
A lot worse?

274
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,320
Like what?

275
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,650
The murder of Shane Thurgood?

276
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,960
No comment.

277
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,690
Another "No comment".

278
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,619
Ma'am?
Ballistics report.

279
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,310
Thank you, DC Shepherd.

280
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,330
What is it?

281
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,820
"Chicken, Tuna, Veggie option."

282
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,020
You've got a match to me,
haven't you?

283
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,059
He hasn't got mental health issues,
has he?

284
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,449
I don't want to end up
in front of a tribunal.

285
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,259
Nah, he's just an eejit.

286
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,289
Hursty's admitted he and Campion

287
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,349
were on the fells
night of the murder.

288
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,769
And there's me just
doing an email for the insurers.

289
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,189
They both had rifles.

290
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,689
So let's take him back there,
walk him through it.

291
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,070
Nice one, Shep.

292
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,880
Only came out for a couple of hinds.

293
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,230
There he is,
dead as a yoyo.

294
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,249
We'd only gone
and shot a bleeding stag.

295
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,580
I was gutted,
tears in my eyes.

296
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,719
We're very moved.

297
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,729
-Then what? Nicked off?
-Linus went ape at me.

298
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,769
-And where was he?
-There, playing at keeping lookout.

299
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,669
Swears he hears a vehicle.

300
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,069
So we shove it
in the back of the pick-up -

301
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,669
I mean, I shove it in,
doing all the donkeywork as per.

302
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,809
You're not gonna leave it
for the birds, are you?

303
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,419
Oh, no.
So then what?

304
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,339
We load up the beast, all good.

305
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,599
And then, boom!
It all kicks off.

306
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,450
-What, shots?
-Right by my ear.

307
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,019
For all his talk, he's not much
of a shot, that Barnes.

308
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,840
-Barnes?
-Peyton's head gamekeeper.

309
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,750
Peyton?

310
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,319
Will Peyton,
Lord of the manor.

311
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,229
-At least, he acts like it.
-Peyton.

312
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,339
-Didn't they bid on Shane's land?
-I'll check.

313
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,799
-You didn't see Shane Thurgood?
-No.

314
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,769
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

315
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,330
Not on the moor?

316
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,200
Not on the way back?

317
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,480
And when we see the pick-up
getting torched, we split up,

318
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,109
made our way home separately.

319
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,120
Via the pub, obviously.

320
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,870
-I'll send Edwards down the pub, shall I?
-Yeah, right.

321
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,000
Of course, Campion
could've met Thurgood later.

322
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,699
-Right. Coffee with milk.
-Thanks.

323
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,360
Ponce-a-ccino with gingerbread.

324
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,899
And an application for a restraining
order for our Mr. Campion.

325
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,629
It wasn't processed?

326
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,939
Close call. We let him off
with a stiff talking-to.

327
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,909
No wonder domestic violence
goes under reported.

328
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,450
Who's his missus?

329
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,980
-A Vanessa Barnes.
-Who?

330
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,470
That's Saskia and Louis's mam.

331
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,280
So they were your kids
found Shane's body?

332
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,180
-Aye.
-Didn't mention it.

333
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,120
Thought you knew.

334
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,930
And you're separated from their mam.

335
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,949
-Divorced.
-Married young.

336
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,260
-What were you, 17?
-16.

337
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,959
Shotgun wedding.

338
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,740
Well, the marriage didn't go very
well at all from what we can see.

339
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,170
There's still a bit in there.
It sets the scanner off at airports.

340
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,419
Who shot you?

341
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,289
Allen Barnes.
That's her dad.

342
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,149
-What, the gamekeeper?
-Proper nutter.

343
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,859
Said he'd aim properly next time

344
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,910
if I went near his daughter again.

345
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,580
Or my kids.

346
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,379
Sorry, Sass.

347
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,580
I don't know what's
happening to your dad.

348
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,400
Sass!

349
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,720
Not scared of Barnes, then.

350
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,940
Poacher's daughter.

351
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,320
Tough as old boots.

352
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,890
Ness?

353
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,810
I think the police are here.

354
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,180
I'll deal with it.

355
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,699
Northumberland & City Police.

356
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,450
Wait a moment, please.

357
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,659
Take more than a dum-dum
to knock him out.

358
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,389
That one's not for shooting.

359
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,139
That's for stalking,
following the trail.

360
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,539
"The Emperor Hadrian".

361
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,199
What kind of a daft name's that
to call an animal?

362
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,029
Couldn't agree more.

363
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,069
We call him Brian.
Were you looking for me?

364
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,419
-And you are?
-Clara Peyton.

365
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,190
-DCI Vera Stanhope.
-DS Joe Ashworth.

366
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,769
Is this about poor Shane?

367
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,979
Sorry,
he's all over the village.

368
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,779
We'd like a word with your head
keeper, Allen Barnes.

369
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,089
I'm afraid he's out on the moor
with a client at the moment.

370
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,930
Dad's stalking, right?

371
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,099
Sorry, you're Allen Barnes' daughter?

372
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,729
Yeah, well, one of them.
I've a sister, Ness.

373
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,069
I think you've met her?

374
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,600
Aye, Sassi and Louis' mam?

375
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,509
So this is a family business, then?

376
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,939
I know. Old-fashioned
but it works for us.

377
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,599
Look, I'm sorry, but my dad never
takes his mobile with him, so...

378
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,189
Does he make an itinerary?

379
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,259
Our friend here
doesn't really have a routine.

380
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,739
We've not seen hide nor
hair of him for two months.

381
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,309
He could be forever.

382
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,889
But I could take a number
and give you a ring as soon as...

383
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,400
No, don't you trouble yourself, love.

384
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,830
Is there somewhere we can wait?

385
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,280
Of course.
Follow me.

386
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,390
Down!

387
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,140
There.

388
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,310
How well did you know
Shane Thurgood?

389
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,429
Now or in the past?

390
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,730
Both.

391
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,779
In the past...

392
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,900
..we were in the same class
for ten years.

393
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,679
When Dad started training him,
we -

394
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,980
Training him?

395
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,309
For what?
To shoot?

396
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,450
To stalk, yes.

397
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,210
Well, he became
part of the furniture.

398
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,370
How do you mean?

399
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,370
Spent most of his time here.

400
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,550
I think that was avoiding his
grandfather more than being with us.

401
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:24,369
So really you'd consider him
to be a family friend?

402
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,219
As a teenager, yes.

403
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,590
But I wouldn't say we knew him now.

404
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,800
That's strange.
Your sister said she hardly knew him.

405
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,510
Right.

406
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,810
Well, I suppose it's all relative.

407
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,529
-Hello?
-Police. Here about Shane.

408
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,769
-Of course.
-Mr. Peyton.

409
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,100
Awful, awful news.
How can we help?

410
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,699
Did you know there was trouble on
your land the night of the shooting?

411
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,009
What sort of trouble?

412
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,679
Some poachers had their truck
burnt out no far the crime scene.

413
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,100
Right. And Shane was mixed up
in that, was he?

414
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,599
You know, I'm not sure
Dad was even out that night.

415
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,759
We have a witness says he was.

416
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,200
Right. Well,
I'm sure he can help, then.

417
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,279
Poachers are an
occupational hazard.

418
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,149
We don't take them too seriously.

419
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,340
So could you show us
where your guns are kept?

420
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,010
-Mind the step.
-Right.

421
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,620
Joe, get all those vehicles checked.

422
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,240
Allen's HQ.

423
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,559
Mark, I need you
to run a few checks.

424
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,780
Guns are in the locker, obviously.

425
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,669
-Could I have the key?
-No. There's only one, as per.

426
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,320
And Dad never lets it
out of his sight, so...

427
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:06,529
That's blooding
after your first kill.

428
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,529
It looks more brutal than it is.

429
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,199
But keeping up tradition,
I see.

430
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,400
Sass? She's not afraid of anything.

431
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,200
And the lad?

432
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,759
-Louis?
-Where's he?

433
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,050
He's not quite made it
to the wall of fame.

434
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,090
When did you last see Shane Thurgood?

435
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,559
Eight or ten weeks ago.

436
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,420
We went to visit the farm.
He was there.

437
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,819
-And you didn't see him again?
-No.

438
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,039
I did most of the negotiation
via email.

439
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,459
And you didn't meet during the sale?

440
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,769
No, Clara handled all the paperwork.

441
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,970
But you authorised
an increased offer twice.

442
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,309
Well, no, we both did.
I'm not the boss.

443
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,809
How did you feel
when the sale fell through?

444
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,659
Well, to be honest,
it was quite infuriating.

445
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,949
Not the old farm, obviously, it was
the land we really wanted to secure.

446
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:06,150
This place is massive.
Why d'you need the extra space?

447
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,420
Doesn't exactly enhance
the surroundings, does it?

448
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,439
How long's it been like this?

449
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,330
Too long.

450
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,479
I don't like to speak ill
of the dead,

451
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,789
but old Joe Thurgood
was running a scrap fiddle.

452
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:57,620
All this tat should, by law,
be properly disposed of.

453
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,649
The herd, in its wisdom,

454
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,509
decided this was
the preferred route.

455
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,850
If you're in the stalking business
and this is the trail, you follow.

456
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,580
Wild beasts...
contrary bunch.

457
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,029
What do the clients think
of an eyesore like this?

458
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:18,080
They're polite. It doesn't scream
bucolic, though, does it?

459
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,019
So we thank God we've
got Emperor Hadrian

460
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,620
to balance things out.

461
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,439
So there's no trophy
for shooting the Emperor?

462
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,319
Lord, no.
He's worth much more alive.

463
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,309
People from all over the world
only see photos.

464
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,660
I've only seen him three times
and I market the fellow.

465
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,259
So poachers shooting your stag

466
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,360
would be more than
an annoyance for you?

467
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,500
They come across the Emperor...

468
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,120
could scupper your whole set-up.

469
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,440
Sassi said the rooks had got him.

470
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:10,460
-How are the kids doing?
-She's a toughie.

471
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,080
Tougher than the lad, anyhow.

472
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,479
Did you ever see him out on the moor,
Shane?

473
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,330
Occasionally.
In the distance.

474
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,139
So you didn't speak to him at all?

475
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,599
If I was out there,
I was with a client.

476
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,380
You don't charge by the hour
and then stop for small talk.

477
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,969
But you did know him
when he was a lad, right?

478
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,409
For a while.

479
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,859
He came to me.

480
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,960
I blooded him,
toughened him up.

481
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,469
-Into the family tradition, eh?
-I did my best.

482
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,399
It didn't do much good.

483
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,510
Upbringing like he had...

484
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,479
..meant he was in on himself,
you know?

485
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,710
I mean, he was good-hearted.
But his mind was messed up.

486
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,699
I feared for him in the town,
I really did.

487
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,420
He did all right.
Published author.

488
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,119
Was he any good, stalking?

489
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,899
Yes. He had an instinct
for the animals.

490
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,650
So was he with the poachers
you confronted?

491
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,179
-Narrow it down for me.
-Tuesday night.

492
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,999
They were shot at
and had their pick-up torched,

493
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,699
just a few miles
from where Shane was killed.

494
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,999
I can't see Linus Campion
pressing charges, can you?

495
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,449
No, but I might.
Attempted murder.

496
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,480
I was just trying to scare them!

497
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,389
As for your question,
no, Shane wasn't with them.

498
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,299
Shane was shot with a hunting rifle.

499
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,259
Something with a soft-nosed round,
probably a .308.

500
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,689
Good. That means it's not my gun
you're looking for.

501
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:49,969
Well, we'll just get that confirmed
by Ballistics, if you don't mind.

502
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:53,579
Could you get Shep to come
and pick up Mr. Barnes' rifles?

503
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,560
Be my guest.

504
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,720
Soft-noses are for clients.

505
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:14,430
You're not saying you shoot clean
with an ordinary bullet, Mr. Barnes?

506
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,570
Only that'd be illegal, wouldn't it?

507
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:32,239
So was Shane part of the furniture
or a neighbour from hell?

508
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,279
Even a neighbour from hell,
you'd show an ounce of grief.

509
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,160
Louis is not playing happy families,
is he?

510
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,469
OK, what do we know about him?

511
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,019
Tragedy strikes, age 11.

512
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,579
-Goes to live with his granddad.
-Yeah

513
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,879
Allen Barnes tries to take him
under his wing.

514
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,759
He shows promise in the field.

515
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,970
Lays his head down at the Peyton
Estate, thank you very much.

516
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,639
Then as soon as he's old enough,

517
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,389
he drops it all
for a life in the city.

518
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,669
Now does that suggest
something happened here

519
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,510
under Barnes's watch?

520
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,150
How did he manage for money?

521
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,909
Big charge debts on his plastic.

522
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,999
-Living hand to mouth, then?
-For some time,

523
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,019
-as far as I can see.
-So it's all going down the pan

524
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,320
in Newcastle.

525
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,389
And then, stroke of luck,
granddad pegs it.

526
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,849
Comes home, sells the farm,
pays off his debts.

527
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:41,069
Needs to sell but changes his mind.

528
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,510
Why would you linger somewhere
that you weren't happy as a kid?

529
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,560
Joe...

530
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,999
..put old ghosts to rest...

531
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,600
..forgive.

532
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,560
Why can't we put anyone
at the scene of the crime that night?

533
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,449
Why has no one come forward?

534
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,849
We've talked to all the locals.
They say he kept himself to himself.

535
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:10,029
Not in the village, Kenny,
in Newcastle.

536
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:13,719
You can't spend 20 years in the city
and not meet someone along the way,

537
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,839
make some human contact.

538
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,039
And what's his novel all about,
eh?

539
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,150
Don't tell me, loneliness.

540
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,339
Well,
there's no reviews on Amazon.

541
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:28,159
But it's on its way from
a second-hand place in Dunstable,

542
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,240
whatever that means.

543
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,230
Right, go home, Kenny.

544
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,789
You too, Joe.
Go on.

545
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,219
Come on,
give us another ten minutes.

546
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,069
It'll get us out of story time.

547
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,599
Well, there's devotion for you.

548
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,800
I wouldn't mind but we're still
on The Philosopher's Stone.

549
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,590
Young man,
head full of dreams.

550
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,959
Wants to be a novelist.

551
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,239
Has his first novel published - good.

552
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,160
And then what?

553
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,880
Kenny...

554
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,799
..were there other articles, short
stories, in that flat in Newcastle?

555
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,400
Nothing, ma'am.

556
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,800
That must rankle,
mustn't it?

557
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,110
Make you feel down?

558
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,879
You will go home tonight, won't you,
get some kip?

559
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,069
Joe, I'm dead on my feet.

560
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,280
-Good night, love.
-Good night.

561
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,620
-Anything?
-There's no reply.

562
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,209
Nothing since the first text.

563
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,459
-What was she thinking?
-She was thinking it was secured!

564
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,999
All right, and that's my fault, is it?

565
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,750
Come here!
Police!

566
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,400
<i>Take it easy, all right?
Take it easy, relax.</i>

567
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,430
<i>Take it easy, OK?</i>

568
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,159
We'll go down the stairs
one step at a time.

569
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,730
Ma'am?
You OK?

570
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,240
Well, I'm dying of thirst
but apart from that...

571
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,210
Secure the flat.

572
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,359
You still here?
Get him down to the station!

573
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,360
-He's says he's got a key.
-What?

574
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,500
Try it.

575
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,859
What were you looking for in there?

576
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,169
He rang me.

577
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,829
He wanted me to send
up a reference book.

578
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,219
Rang you?
When?

579
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,160
Tuesday morning.
Call him, check.

580
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,450
How do you know Shane Thurgood?

581
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,579
He's my pot man.
Well, was.

582
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,589
Sacked him.
We're still mates, though.

583
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,610
-Ask him!
-We can't do that.

584
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,330
I'm afraid he's dead.

585
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,510
Found his body up on the fells.

586
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,540
I've got a copy of it here
somewhere.

587
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,250
He signed it for me.

588
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,419
I'm guessing you can't
cos you're on duty.

589
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,550
No, go on, love.
He's driving.

590
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,660
What?

591
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,490
Thanks, Terry.

592
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,829
When did you last see him?

593
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,480
It was a while back.

594
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,619
But we emailed a bit.

595
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,119
What was the book
he wanted you to send him?

596
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,239
Some Celtic folklore one.

597
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,919
Said he couldn't get
what he needed on the internet.

598
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,350
Why didn't he pop into town
and fetch it himself?

599
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,629
I got the impression
he was trying to keep a low profile.

600
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,849
Owed various people various sums.

601
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:48,359
He owed me at least 500.

602
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,240
Anyone in particular?

603
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,300
Somebody called Don, I think.

604
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,839
Did he ever mention
selling his granddad's place?

605
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,059
Yeah. When he died,
it was like he'd won the lottery.

606
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,439
Not in a mean way,
but I don't think they were close.

607
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,830
And did he say why
he decided to pull out of the sale?

608
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,379
He said he'd fallen
back in love with the place.

609
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,480
He was a bit of a romantic
like that.

610
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,190
Poor guy.

611
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,200
"Queen Mab's Fool"
"For whom it did concern"

612
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,289
So we've matched
Barnes's bullet casing

613
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,409
-to the truck shooting.
-Now there's a surprise.

614
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,519
Still nothing ballistics wise
to link anyone to Thurgood's death.

615
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,149
In layman's terms we've got nowt.

616
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,529
Maybe you're right,
it does lie in the city.

617
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:10,069
Did you check the camera footage
from outside his street?

618
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:13,039
For when he was being done in
30 miles away?

619
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,399
Just check days before, days after.

620
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,059
No, I think Kenny's right.
The village - that's his world.

621
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,079
I read his novel.

622
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,909
Autobiography, more like.

623
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,359
It's all about out there,
it's like...

624
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,540
..like it's got a hold on him.

625
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:31,610
And we're back to witchcraft.

626
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:36,839
Queen Mab, I Googled.
Celtic folklore.

627
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,349
Now, she pops up again
in Romeo and Juliet.

628
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:42,799
And this plot is a variation
on that theme.

629
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,259
But I'm making it sound
worse than it actually is.

630
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,819
So who was his Juliet?

631
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,909
Exactly. That's question number one.

632
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:51,850
Question two is: who is this Don

633
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,230
who's chasing him for money?

634
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,529
It could be Donald Colley. At least,

635
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,480
he's paying the money to the agents
for Thurgood's flat.

636
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,100
"Colley Press"?
So Don's his publisher?

637
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,449
-Who is it?
-Mr. Colley?

638
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,600
Northumberland & City Police.

639
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,880
I need to see some ID.

640
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,320
That's terrible news.

641
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,060
Bella?

642
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,640
Shane Thurgood's died.

643
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:01,520
That's a lot of effort wasted.

644
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,909
These are police.

645
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,890
He was shot in the chest.

646
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,599
Mab did well.

647
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,199
Folklorey stuff was going down
a storm back then.

648
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,509
-Thanks.
-And, of course,

649
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:16,399
The story was interesting,
a very powerful love story.

650
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,119
That was the crossover appeal.

651
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,709
There was a big marketing push
about it being autobiographical.

652
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:26,330
I wouldn't make too much of that.
He was always thin on the detail.

653
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,149
When was this?

654
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,489
When were the bombs in London?
It was around then.

655
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:32,079
-'05?
-'05.

656
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,889
We were keen to build momentum
but he got sidetracked.

657
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,349
It happens.
A bit of success,

658
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:39,709
they lose incentive
till the cash runs out.

659
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,369
A year or so ago he comes back,

660
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,779
pitched for a follow-up
but wanted an advance.

661
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,619
-So you paid his rent?
-Yes.

662
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:49,849
He did a bit of bar work on the side
for living expenses but, yes,

663
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:53,819
the rent was our way of paying him
and giving him somewhere to write.

664
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,699
-What was the follow-up like?
-It never appeared.

665
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,719
He kept promising,
but nothing.

666
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,929
Another personal book, he said,

667
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,689
though what exactly
he meant by that...

668
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,510
Promises -
he was big on those.

669
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,359
-But you continued to pay?
-Well, yes...

670
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,959
It never reached a point
where writing off the loss

671
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,490
outweighed potential earnings
from a sequel.

672
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,279
That's frustrating for you.

673
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,020
Well, I wouldn't be in this business
if I wasn't used to authors, but...

674
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:25,880
Yes, yes, yes,
we were feeling very let down.

675
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,600
Well, nothing's been damaged.

676
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:38,110
Lucky for you lot.

677
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,210
We'll be holding on to the rifle
you used on the truck.

678
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,319
Impressive kit you've got here.

679
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,210
-What are you, ex-army?
-Military police.

680
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,040
Ever shot a man dead?

681
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,070
Me neither.

682
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:17,659
Now was he taking advantage
of their good nature?

683
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,369
Or was he planning to deliver?

684
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:21,169
Not exactly a motive
for murder, is it?

685
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:22,540
A missed deadline?

686
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:24,959
Kenny, who else have they got
on their book?

687
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,959
You've got it. Jealous
rival claims he stole his story.

688
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,600
Yeah, you said nicked it off
Shakespeare. Should I look him up?

689
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,720
Just him, by the look of it.

690
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,109
He's their big seller.

691
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:40,410
Was.

692
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,930
That place is a tip.
They're not making any money.

693
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,299
Do a credit check,
Companies House and what have you.

694
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,400
And let's have another look
at our victim's bank statements.

695
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,499
I'm just leaving the estate now.

696
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,769
Listen, Thurgood spent a grand in
the Apple store in the Eldon centre.

697
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,119
<i>-Find out what he bought.</i>
-Will do.

698
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,689
It's got to be a computer
or a laptop, hasn't it?

699
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:06,320
Or seven iPhones.

700
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:09,879
But we didn't find anything
at the farmhouse, did we?

701
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,720
Unless that's what they took.

702
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:18,109
Well, our bookish friends are
being chased by the bailiffs.

703
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:22,250
Bunch of CCJs. They haven't paid
themselves a salary for two years.

704
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,219
OK.

705
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,729
Joe, go stick your foot in the
bailiffs' door.

706
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,030
See how they like it.

707
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:41,149
Colley's?
Yeah, I know 'em.

708
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,880
Sneaky so and so's.

709
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,719
She's a sly little madam, is missus.

710
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,829
Did you ever come across
a Shane Thurgood?

711
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:50,889
Did he ever pay up for them
or anything like that?

712
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:53,599
Don't recognise the name.
Who is he?

713
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,429
He's one of their authors.
He lives up by the fell, Hepbridge.

714
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:00,710
The village I know. It's where I
gave her the notice of repossession.

715
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,909
-She's been up there?
-Yep. I followed Mrs. Colley up.

716
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:07,019
Like a dog with a bone, me.

717
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,120
-When was this?
-Tuesday.

718
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,409
Being broke isn't a crime.

719
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,710
-No, but burglary is, pet.
-I didn't burglary anyone.

720
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,839
I went round to check he was OK.

721
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,899
I admit I took the laptop
to look at -

722
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,389
-That's theft.
-But I wasn't stealing it.

723
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,899
Come on, love!
You're not daft.

724
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,339
You took it from the property
without the owner knowing.

725
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,069
He wouldn't have minded.

726
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,499
I was helping him.

727
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,360
Get Shep to call round
to Mrs. Colley.

728
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,060
Save you the trouble
of returning it yourself.

729
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,390
So...
what's it like, his new work?

730
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,979
Sentimental.

731
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,719
A cruel king and a boy,

732
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,040
and some magic beastie.

733
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,559
He said it was personal?

734
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,110
Possibly.
There's not much to go on.

735
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:01,230
A few chapter notes, a few paras.

736
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,689
It was all a bit Lassie
for my taste.

737
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,990
-You do sound bitter.
-I am.

738
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,740
We put all our faith in him.

739
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,600
So you admit to taking the laptop.
Anything else?

740
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:16,030
-Some notebooks.
-Why'd you take those?

741
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,519
Did you think they'd be worth
something posthumously?

742
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,229
If that's an innuendo
I was involved

743
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,579
-in his death...
-It's not an innuendo, love.

744
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,220
It's a direct question.

745
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:31,430
No, I didn't murder him,
for heaven's sake.

746
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:36,560
Yes, we thought we might be able to
make something from the notebooks.

747
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,120
They're all handwritten, of course.

748
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:46,520
Good luck with that.

749
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:52,979
I can't read a word of this.
Can you?

750
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,280
Give it here.

751
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,660
"I never...

752
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,429
"I never hurt no man for no...

753
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,549
"good season"?

754
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:05,869
"Steaming"?

755
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,420
"I never hurt any man
for no good reason."

756
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,139
-Easy.
-Oh, is it?

757
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,559
Well, there you go,
then, Mr. DC Clever Dick.

758
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,560
Get that typed up and stick it
on the computer, there's a love.

759
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,530
Don't go knocking it.
It's a big development, this one.

760
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,510
-Ma'am.
-What?

761
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,989
What am I looking at?

762
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:29,639
Footage outside the victim's flat
in Tyneside.

763
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,689
When's this taken?
24 hours before the time of death.

764
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,300
Let me guess -

765
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,860
-Barnes?
-Nope.

766
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,860
His daughter.

767
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:42,970
Ness?

768
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,350
-Sass, stop!
-There we go.

769
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,080
-Not so bad, is it?
-It's not funny!

770
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:20,050
Looking for your mam.

771
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:23,009
Yeah...
she's somewhere.

772
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:25,719
You looking to be blooded,
are you?

773
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,229
No chance
I'm not interested.

774
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:29,810
Good for you.

775
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:33,599
Louis reckons he saw the Emperor.

776
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,459
Stands up like an
idiot in assembly,

777
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,629
mouthing to the whole
bloody school.

778
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,279
-I saw him.
-Why would the Emperor

779
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,579
show his face
to a hummel like you?

780
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,070
-Shut up!
-I'm just saying what Dad said.

781
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:47,049
What's a hummel when it's at home?

782
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:50,070
-It's a...
-It's a stag without any antlers.

783
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,000
That's a popular term of abuse
round here, is it?

784
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,710
It's what they call me.

785
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,480
Here, wipe that muck off your face.

786
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,379
No school today?

787
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,260
Don't go to school.

788
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,500
-Go to a centre.
-Why, did you get chucked out?

789
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,910
Just sticking up for myself.

790
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,410
The bullies giving you grief,
were they?

791
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,129
Yeah.

792
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,559
They said I'd be safer
at the centre.

793
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,699
And what's the centre like?

794
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,450
What do you think?

795
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,190
That you'd rather be home here
with your family.

796
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,520
-I like it outside.
-Me too, love.

797
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:46,379
-Gonna join the business?
-No, thanks.

798
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,250
20 grand to hunt
some knackered old stag?

799
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:53,170
-He's not even that massive.
-And you've seen him, the Emperor?

800
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:57,719
So he claims.

801
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,050
Big imagination, this one.

802
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,220
You want me?

803
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,330
Yeah, just to check a few things.
Nothing urgent.

804
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,160
So it was just a coincidence?

805
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,549
Am I not allowed
to go to Newcastle now?

806
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:35,349
First you say you barely knew him,
barely on nodding terms.

807
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:38,579
Then it comes to light
he's practically one of the family!

808
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,839
You're on CCTV on his street
24 hours before he dies.

809
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,729
We're not jumping to conclusions.

810
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:45,509
You're not being straight with us.

811
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:48,420
-Were you having an affair with him?
-No.

812
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:51,120
I'm happy being single, thanks.

813
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,960
-Have you read his book?
-Couldn't get through it.

814
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:08,589
Is the girl in it based on you?

815
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:11,060
The daft one who whines a lot?
No.

816
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,819
I just went to talk to him.

817
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,220
I called.
He said he was at his flat.

818
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,939
Why was he there?
I thought he was settled here.

819
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,360
Picking up some "resources".

820
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,620
So what was on your mind?

821
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,319
Tell him to back off Clara.

822
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,540
-He was stalking her.
-Your sister?

823
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:20,409
Stalking's too strong a word.

824
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:22,359
That's just Ness being dramatic.

825
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:25,929
-What was he doing?
-Trying to win me over.

826
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:28,520
Gifts, poems, that sort of thing.

827
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:32,320
-Was he in with a chance?
-No. I'm married.

828
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,859
Are you the girl in his book?

829
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:38,799
Look,
the book was sweet,

830
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,900
but it doesn't mean
it's based on anything.

831
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,949
So if I asked around,

832
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:46,930
nobody'd remember
you two stepping out as teenagers?

833
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,760
Maybe we dated a bit, but at that
age, you date everyone, don't you?

834
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,379
Did your dad put a stop to you
and Shane

835
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,040
like he did your sister and Campion?

836
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:02,470
That's not all made up,
is it, the book?

837
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:08,979
The tyrannical father, lovers
torn apart. That's not fiction.

838
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:13,390
Are you the reason Shane pulled out
of the sale of the farm?

839
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,040
Possibly.

840
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:19,750
-And was that all in vain?
-Yes.

841
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,490
I don't believe you.

842
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,659
It's a nice story, pet,

843
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,400
but come on!

844
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,790
On a couple of occasions,

845
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,450
I probably
responded more than I should have.

846
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,620
I was flattered.

847
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,019
Were you having an affair
when he died?

848
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,909
No, I stopped it.

849
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:46,189
Which is why he was trying
to get my attention,

850
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,059
which is why Ness intervened,
telling him to back off.

851
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:52,550
Would poaching catch your attention?
Get his own back?

852
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,380
No.
He wouldn't hurt the herd.

853
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,519
He was a stalker,
not a killer.

854
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,389
What do you think he was doing
on the moor?

855
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:03,760
Genuinely? No idea.

856
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,840
Where were you Tuesday night?

857
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,980
We were hosting a supper party.

858
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,060
We will have to verify that.

859
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,460
I know.

860
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:22,410
Is there any way that can be done
without Will finding out?

861
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,949
It's not our job to spare
people's feelings, you know.

862
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:38,010
It's not our job
to ruin marriages either.

863
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:41,030
Is there a way of asking
that without...

864
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,220
No. No, there's not,
I'm gonna have to ask.

865
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,359
Gives him a motive, doesn't it?

866
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,970
Absolutely.
He might know. Guys normally do.

867
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:16,930
Thank you.

868
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,189
We do appreciate your discretion.

869
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:22,759
Well, we don't want to frighten off
the tourist trade.

870
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,449
Well, they're all intrigued.

871
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:25,929
We're in the wrong business -

872
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:29,139
we should host one of those
murder mystery weekends.

873
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,050
How is business?

874
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,410
Well...
we survived the recession.

875
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,439
Learnt a few lessons.

876
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,099
-Haven't we all?
-All hands on deck, eh?

877
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,990
Yep.
Kids up chimneys.

878
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:48,690
Do you think Shane Thurgood
was poaching?

879
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,429
Honestly - yes.

880
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:54,899
But I very much doubt Allen
had anything to do with his death.

881
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,429
No, that's not what I'm asking.

882
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,679
I'm sorry. I just assumed...

883
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,409
Surely Barnes wouldn't kill a man
just to save your business?

884
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,179
That's taking loyalty a bit too far.

885
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,299
Exactly. At the end of the day,
Brian's just an attraction.

886
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,579
I often joke we'd be better off
with a rollercoaster.

887
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,649
Your nephew said he saw the Emperor.

888
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:15,560
Louis?
Well...

889
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,779
I mean... pinch of salt there,
don't you think?

890
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,250
Said he was getting on a bit.

891
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,960
So what'll you do
when he's gone?

892
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:25,700
Ask me another.

893
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:29,750
What was your relationship
with Shane Thurgood?

894
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,420
We didn't have one.

895
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,850
-Never even spoken?
-No.

896
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:41,190
Why not?

897
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,759
I think he was in love with my wife.

898
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,360
It put me off him.

899
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,990
Were those feelings mutual?

900
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:57,360
I never asked.

901
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,700
I hope not.

902
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,530
I really hope not.

903
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:16,219
Where were you Tuesday night
when he died?

904
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:18,290
Tuesday night is curry night.

905
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,749
Ask any of the guests.

906
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:24,320
We were giving it our hostess
with the mostest.

907
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:37,249
I want every guest
questioned again,

908
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,599
every second accounted for.

909
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,299
Did Peyton leave the meal
for a significant time,

910
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,139
either to go to the cellar for
something or out for a crafty smoke?

911
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,849
Anything that might suggest either

912
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:51,239
he or wifey had
a window of opportunity.

913
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,759
-Ma'am.
-What have we got?

914
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,369
The pages from the notebook
the victim was writing.

915
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:59,279
-In that spidery script? Any good?
-It's about a bully.

916
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,169
Is there anything in it for us,
anything to help?

917
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:04,640
Possibly. Look at the second page.

918
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:07,360
Page two.

919
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:12,069
"The King liked to dress up fine

920
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:14,480
"and charm the ladies
when he could,

921
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:17,399
"but the boy had smelt the blood

922
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,860
"on that man's clothes."
Blimey.

923
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:23,059
"He was sure some
of it was his own."

924
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:24,369
A bit creepy.

925
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:26,129
Shane as a boy,
with his granddad?

926
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,560
What,
holed up in that cottage?

927
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:31,840
Look at them.

928
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:37,360
I think you were right.
He knew.

929
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:40,250
Is that for our benefit,
do we think?

930
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,940
I'd say not.

931
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:51,300
OK. Let's just say it's not
the husband in a jealous rage.

932
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:53,610
What have we got?

933
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:55,920
Well, there's Barnes.

934
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:59,980
If Shane was stalking the stag
and seducing his daughter,

935
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:03,029
is that motive enough
for him to kill him?

936
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:04,729
A warning that went wrong?

937
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:07,839
Wel, he did it to Campion, didn't he?
For laying hands on his other lass.

938
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:12,980
Aye, but that was domestic violence
and therefore entirely justified.

939
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,380
But Shane wasn't like that, was he?

940
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:20,770
By all accounts.

941
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,420
Wouldn't hurt an animal.

942
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:31,490
-Where's Shep?
-I'm here, I'm here.

943
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,699
Did you pick up that laptop
from the Colley's

944
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,879
or are you waiting till they delete
the hard drive?

945
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,239
I got sidetracked down the lab.

946
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,859
-There's new evidence.
-I expect it's good.

947
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:42,959
The tyre prints outside Shane's
cottage match Colley's car.

948
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,219
-That's your new evidence?
-Also

949
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:48,109
match the head
keeper's vehicle.

950
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,579
Half the village
drive Land Rovers.

951
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:02,469
-You drive one yourself!
-What were you doing at his place,

952
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:03,770
Mr. Barnes?

953
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,020
Why lie?

954
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:16,020
Why say you only saw him on the moor
once or twice?

955
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,140
What are you hiding from us?

956
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:25,179
I can see it must rankle,

957
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,699
him coming back after
all these years.

958
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,090
Pupil turned master.

959
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:33,149
Shane was good.

960
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:35,129
A better tracker than I ever was.

961
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:37,660
-But he wasn't a poacher.
-What?

962
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:41,469
His house -
dirty great bag of human hair.

963
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:44,379
What did he want that for,
if not to manipulate the herd?

964
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,349
Taking the Emperor off our land.

965
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:47,709
-To get back at you?
-No.

966
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,580
So you confronted him.

967
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,900
Actually...

968
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:01,060
I asked him quite politely.

969
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:04,379
He said...

970
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:07,760
he'd got wind
of a change of strategy.

971
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,780
Go on.

972
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:13,260
Peyton Estates.

973
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:16,679
Might look like they're
doing all right,

974
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,269
but the recession
knocked it out of them.

975
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:21,549
-We know that.
-You do?

976
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:22,969
I didn't.

977
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:26,169
Did you know they were
putting the Emperor up for bounty?

978
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:30,540
This bloke from a German bank
offers 20K for him.

979
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,669
Will agreed,
apparently.

980
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:35,629
Said they had to cash in before it
was too late.

981
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:38,750
"Simple economics of return
on an investment."

982
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,879
And they kept that from you?

983
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,500
Only one out of the loop,
apparently.

984
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:52,820
So you're saying Thurgood
wasn't hunting the Emperor,

985
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:57,260
-he was trying to protect it.
-Aye.

986
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,920
I don't kill men, Mrs. Stanhope.

987
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,840
What about a man who was having
an affair with your daughter?

988
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,080
They re-kindled it, did they?
I thought they might.

989
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:26,390
Once again,

990
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,300
I can't see
what's under my own nose, can I?

991
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:39,169
So Thurgood was murdered here,

992
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:41,159
and less than a mile
that way

993
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,929
you've got Allen Barnes
shooting at Linus Campion.

994
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:45,919
And a mile that way,

995
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,439
you've got Peyton quietly
contemplating

996
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,470
his wife's infidelity.

997
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,609
We got 21 diners

998
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:56,810
say the Peytons had their
hands full serving vindaloo.

999
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:59,359
We know that Barnes hasn't an alibi.

1000
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,330
We know that Barnes has a temper.

1001
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,170
And we know that Barnes is a shot.

1002
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,059
And yet still...

1003
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:09,220
I think he's telling the truth.

1004
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:14,250
-So?
-So we're nowhere.

1005
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,160
The middle of bloody nowhere.

1006
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,620
Oh, where's the magic
when you need it?

1007
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:27,820
Where's the bloody phone line
when you need it?

1008
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:30,099
Who you trying to bloody call?

1009
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:34,340
DC Bloody Shepherd,
see if she's picked up that...

1010
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:37,450
-You what?
-That laptop...

1011
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:44,220
-Come on!
-What?

1012
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:49,530
We need to get back to the station.
Get on to Social Services.

1013
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:53,280
Oh, how can I be so bloody stupid?

1014
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:59,750
You gave me a fright.

1015
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,729
Congratulations.
You're on YouTube.

1016
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:05,309
Really?

1017
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,389
I could actually use a
man about the house...

1018
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:08,699
for about 12 minutes a day.

1019
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,999
You had one.
You threw him out, remember?

1020
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,750
I know.
I know that.

1021
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:15,600
Not like that.

1022
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:20,460
You're worse than Louis, you are.

1023
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,660
-You have to get a proper grip on it.
-Really? Says who?

1024
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:30,450
See?
Nothing to it.

1025
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:42,060
Busy, busy, busy.

1026
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,290
You know, we had a witness
in here the other day.

1027
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,320
Your dad, as it happens.

1028
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:52,179
He wasn't very forthcoming.

1029
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:55,400
But he caved in in the end,
so I let him go.

1030
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:59,619
And there you were, the little
welcoming party waiting outside.

1031
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,509
I didn't think much of it
at the time.

1032
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:04,229
He didn't think much of you either,
to be honest.

1033
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:06,400
I'm sorry, love.
Have I touched a nerve?

1034
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:10,120
-Proper little daddy's girl.
-No.

1035
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:16,180
Only, I'd have thought,
after what he did to your mam...

1036
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:20,199
-He wouldn't...
-Wouldn't...what?

1037
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,690
Hit you?
Well, that's good.

1038
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:25,799
-So your mam had it coming, did she?
-No.

1039
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,989
That's enough. I'll stop this
unless you formally charge her.

1040
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:30,290
We understand.

1041
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,200
We didn't mean to cause any offence,
did we, ma'am?

1042
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,260
No, we do understand.

1043
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:43,650
I mean, having an abusive man
in the house will take its toll.

1044
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:45,760
Being a daughter...

1045
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:51,399
And being a daughter, you've
seen him at his worst, haven't you?

1046
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,320
No matter how much
your mam tries to hide it.

1047
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:59,439
So you know what the smart thing
to do is, love?

1048
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,149
-Don't know what you're on about.
-Cut him loose,

1049
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:03,469
cut him out,
like a cancer!

1050
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:06,330
-Can I say that?
-Say what you like.

1051
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,490
But there's another part of you,
isn't there?

1052
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:13,290
That says you're the only girl...

1053
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,970
the only girl in the whole wide world
who can save him. Hm?

1054
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:25,209
And believe me, love, you
wouldn't be the first to think that.

1055
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:27,450
I think we've heard enough.
Come on.

1056
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:33,779
So you go out on your quad bikes,
you and your brother Louis.

1057
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:35,539
You found this dead man.

1058
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:38,110
You called us from
the murder scene.

1059
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,620
Yeah.

1060
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,649
But there's no signal at the murder
scene, or anywhere near it.

1061
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:50,300
So how did you do that,
make a call without a signal?

1062
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,829
Sit down, love.

1063
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:56,590
Mrs. Jackson, please.

1064
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:11,149
-I called.
-I know you did.

1065
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:13,389
You called the emergency services.

1066
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:15,290
I heard it.
Well done.

1067
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:18,290
But where did you make the call from?

1068
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,949
-Home.
-Home?

1069
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:26,959
So you went out on your bikes

1070
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:30,159
and saw the dead body
and then you went home.

1071
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,330
Now, don't be frightened, love.

1072
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:37,320
Just tell me, how long was it
before you made that call?

1073
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,360
-About an hour.
-An hour?

1074
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:47,850
And what did you do in that hour, hm?

1075
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:59,490
It was for my dad.

1076
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,810
<i>What was for your dad?</i>

1077
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:10,539
Sassi, I'm sorry, love,
but I need to hear you say it.

1078
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:12,910
What was for your dad?

1079
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:17,820
He shot Shane Thurgood.

1080
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:50,450
Come on, love, help us out here.

1081
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,519
-There. Under that tree.
-Good girl.

1082
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,690
OK, under the tree.

1083
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:17,889
What were you thinking of?
Sweetheart?

1084
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,399
We're gonna need to talk to your son.
Where is he?

1085
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,019
No.
Both of them?

1086
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:25,359
-Can't say till I've spoken to him.
-But he hates his dad!

1087
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,750
-That's what you think.
-No.

1088
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:31,949
Louis was always frightened of
Linus. He wouldn't protect him.

1089
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:36,010
I want you to bring him into the
station, just so he can corroborate.

1090
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:46,759
We've found the murder weapon,
Mr. Campion.

1091
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:49,430
-No comment.
-Oh, crumbs.

1092
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,700
The weapon you used to shoot
and kill Shane Thurgood.

1093
01:14:55,710 --> 01:14:59,569
No.
Nah, I'm not even listening to this.

1094
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:01,759
We've got you in the fells,
in your truck,

1095
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,969
-poaching.
-I was in the area, so what?

1096
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:05,279
Poaching -
I already told you.

1097
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,399
And an eyewitness
who saw you pull the trigger.

1098
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,700
What?

1099
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,620
Hang on...

1100
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,999
Are we talking about Sass here?

1101
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,089
-My daughter, did she put you up to this?
-Why would you say that?

1102
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:20,109
She came out with this crap the
other day.

1103
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:22,499
-I put her straight.
-Yes, I bet you did.

1104
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:25,340
She didn't see me. She wasn't the
one who was up there, was she?

1105
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:30,390
-So who was?
-Nobody.

1106
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,500
Who?

1107
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,540
My son.

1108
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:40,839
Louis?

1109
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,840
I took him up to blood him in.

1110
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:47,250
You took that lad poaching?

1111
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,220
Why didn't you mention
any of this before?

1112
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:53,540
He was hardly there.

1113
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,840
He's having trouble at school.

1114
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:58,430
He's soft.
I thought it might help.

1115
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:00,419
First chance he gets,

1116
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,019
jumps out the truck and
legs it into the night.

1117
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:04,499
When was this?

1118
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,889
Around the time his granddad
shot up the truck.

1119
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:08,289
He's the one you should be after.

1120
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:11,690
Where'd he run off to in the middle
of the night, your son, hm?

1121
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,799
Any idea?

1122
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,620
Into the hills,
I dunno.

1123
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,200
Back to his mam,
no doubt.

1124
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:35,170
-Did he take a weapon?
-Aye.

1125
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,880
So what?
He couldn't hit a barn door.

1126
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:46,339
Has Ness Barnes
brought her son in yet?

1127
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:49,640
She called to say she'd looked
everywhere, but couldn't find him.

1128
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,190
-Hello?
<i>-Up her</i>e.

1129
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:10,100
-Has Louis turned up yet?
-No.

1130
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:11,710
Sassi?

1131
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:16,590
Now, Sassi, I need you to tell me
the truth.

1132
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:22,549
Are you absolutely certain
you saw your dad kill Shane Thurgood?

1133
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:24,950
You watched him pull that trigger?

1134
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:29,560
Well...

1135
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:33,299
..not...
not me.

1136
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,600
Louis?

1137
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:37,210
Yes.

1138
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:40,899
Louis told you
he saw your dad kill Shane?

1139
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,250
He was in a state, to be honest.

1140
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:47,010
He's always needed me
to look after him.

1141
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,220
So Louis told you what he saw.

1142
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:56,509
And then he told
you to hide the gun,

1143
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:59,790
as a secret, for your dad?
Yeah.

1144
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:08,010
Sassi...

1145
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:12,360
Do you know where Louis is?

1146
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:16,720
No...
I don't know.

1147
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:21,920
<i>Louis!</i>

1148
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:28,830
Louis!

1149
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:45,739
-Any sign of the lad?
-No. Nothing.

1150
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:48,529
He's not at the murder site
or Thurgood's scrap yard.

1151
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:51,249
There's a lot of land to cover,
and the temperature's dropping.

1152
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:52,550
Excuse me!

1153
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,099
I'm sorry.
It's just -

1154
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,539
there is somewhere
we used to go when we were small,

1155
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,699
sort of scare each other
half to death.

1156
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:02,660
-Where's that, love?
-At Auntie Clara's.

1157
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:04,270
Peyton's.

1158
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,560
Sassi, hop in.

1159
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:19,120
So, your brother and the Emperor.

1160
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:22,709
Do you think Shane Thurgood
could have taken him to see it?

1161
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:25,130
Do you think it's possible
they were friends?

1162
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:28,499
It's possible.

1163
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,359
Shane was writing a new book.

1164
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,669
And?

1165
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:35,850
Here, read.
Second page.

1166
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:39,419
"The King liked to dress up fine

1167
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:41,029
"and charm the ladies
when he could,

1168
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:43,319
but the boy had smelt the blood
on that man's clothes."

1169
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,490
"He was sure some of it
was his own."

1170
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:48,749
Now you look at this.
Look here.

1171
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,399
The blood on your dad's apron.

1172
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:54,109
I thought he was writing the book
about himself,

1173
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:57,060
but I now think he was writing
about somebody else.

1174
01:19:58,290 --> 01:19:59,749
My brother.

1175
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:01,050
And...

1176
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,800
My dad.

1177
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:18,669
I need everyone away from the house.

1178
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:21,699
This is my livelihood.
Have you any idea what you're doing?

1179
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:24,270
As I said,
it's just a precautionary measure.

1180
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,429
Jesus.

1181
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:29,119
May I suggest we all repair
to the pavilion,

1182
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,079
where my wife has prepared
a small surprise?

1183
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,970
Just get everyone out of here.

1184
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:39,430
Saskia, could Louis have got in here
without the grown-ups knowing?

1185
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:42,939
Yeah, there's a back way, behind
the old kitchen.

1186
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:44,240
Thanks, love.

1187
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:46,310
Wait.

1188
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:51,630
What you said before about the girl
who thinks she can save her dad?

1189
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,180
Was that you?

1190
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,790
-Yes, love.
-And did you?

1191
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:02,249
-Save him?
-No, love, I didn't,

1192
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:05,199
because in the end,
he didn't want saving.

1193
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,180
They never do.

1194
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:14,020
Ma'am?
There's blood on the walls.

1195
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:41,750
What the hell has he done?

1196
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,100
-Louis?
<i>-Don't come any nearer!</i>

1197
01:22:26,110 --> 01:22:27,689
Hey...

1198
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:29,990
I'm not tracking you here,

1199
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:31,880
I'm just...

1200
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:33,920
It's just...

1201
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:37,479
Well, your family
are all worried about you,

1202
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:40,250
they just want to know you're safe.

1203
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:47,260
You miss him, do you?
Shane?

1204
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:56,039
<i>-Don't come in!</i>
-All right, love.

1205
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,730
No, I'll just stay here, then,
shall I?

1206
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:06,850
I didn't mean it.

1207
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,790
<i>I know you didn't, lad.</i>

1208
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:13,899
<i>Shane was the last person
you wanted to hurt.</i>

1209
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,910
<i>He was your friend, wasn't he?</i>

1210
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,750
<i>He taught you
how to track the deer.</i>

1211
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:23,180
More than that.

1212
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:29,550
<i>-He showed you the Emperor.</i>
-Yeah.

1213
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,360
What was he like, hm?

1214
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:37,550
Is he as big as they say?

1215
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:40,800
Bigger.

1216
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:46,000
Hard not to be believed...

1217
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,240
..trusted.

1218
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:53,360
They laughed at me.

1219
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,680
<i>What, at school?</i>

1220
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,590
<i>Your family, your dad?</i>

1221
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:02,539
Everyone.

1222
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:05,849
If just one person...
just one person

1223
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:09,100
had stood up and said,
"I believe you...

1224
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:12,630
..I believe in you..."

1225
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:28,730
Can I come in, Louis?
I just want to see you're OK.

1226
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,480
He was writing a book about you,
did you know that?

1227
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:46,880
And him.

1228
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:51,600
And any other kid
who felt the way you did.

1229
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:59,819
I know you didn't mean to shoot him.

1230
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:02,230
You were after an animal,
weren't you?

1231
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,940
I just wanted people to believe me.

1232
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:12,659
<i>And there was Shane,
up on the moor that night,</i>

1233
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:16,660
<i>trying to lead the Emperor
away to safety,</i>

1234
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:19,490
<i>where no one could shoot him.</i>

1235
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,180
<i>And there you were.</i>

1236
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:27,539
Now, what is the first rule
of hunting, hm?

1237
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:31,580
Never grab the man with a gun,
right?

1238
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:36,490
<i>Did he try to disarm you, love...
after you shot the stag?</i>

1239
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:38,900
He tried but...

1240
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:43,450
..I fell back and it went off.

1241
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:47,800
And I...

1242
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,100
He...

1243
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:55,700
He was my friend.

1244
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,259
Not your fault, son.

1245
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:16,010
It was an accident.

1246
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:19,200
A tragedy.

1247
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:34,669
They'll have to believe us
now...

1248
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:35,970
won't they?

1249
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:44,050
Yeah. They
will.

1250
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:12,269
What's it in aid of,
this mystery tour, anyway?

1251
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:15,999
We are tracking the Emperor.

1252
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,979
-You what?
-What's left of him.

1253
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:20,480
Louis said he was up here somewhere.

1254
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:28,610
How does it end, this book that
Thurgood was writing? Do we know?

1255
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:33,059
Well, the boy drives the beast
over the border.

1256
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:35,499
It's last seen in open country.

1257
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:39,109
And then with one last shout
from the boy...

1258
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:43,240
the animal runs...
it runs.

1259
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:47,409
Really?
Or did you just make that up?

1260
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:49,670
What?
Of course not.

1261
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,880
Ask Edwards,
he'll back me up.

1262
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:05,400
There's your Emperor.

1263
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:12,240
The fight in that thing.

1264
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:15,650
How far are we from the murder scene?

1265
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:19,629
About 12 miles.

1266
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:22,770
12 miles it ran,

1267
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,899
after that boy shot it.

1268
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,930
12 miles.

1269
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:32,059
Soft jury, he'll get off.
It's manslaughter.

1270
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:34,190
-He didn't mean to do it.
-I know.

1271
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:43,130
-So?
-So?

1272
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,340
So nothing.

1273
01:28:46,650 --> 01:28:47,950
Come on.

1274
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:03,160

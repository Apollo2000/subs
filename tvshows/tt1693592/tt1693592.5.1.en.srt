00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,680
Dad.

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,100

7
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,990
- Kenny.
- Ma'am.

8
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,719
- How many?
- Er... only the one.

9
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,699
- Well, only one so far.
- Right.

10
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,559
Head count a priority,
mate, fast as we can.

11
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,919
This is DCI Stanhope.
Ma'am, this is DS...

12
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,550
- I know who you are.
- Great to meet you.

13
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,099
- How did you find Galway?
- You know, green.

14
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,869
So, who's in charge here?

15
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,399
Bloke in the white helmet.

16
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,259
No, I meant of the caravan park.

17
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,269
- We're tracking down the owner.
- Right.

18
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,169
Well, fast as you can,
then, mate.

19
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,330
Top priority: blues.

20
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,559
I've already been shouted
at by Forensics.

21
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,020
Soon as you can.

22
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,299
I was gonna introduce you.

23
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,350
- How was...?
- You know.

24
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,599
Do we know the ID of the deceased?

25
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,909
Not yet. We're matching
it to the guest list.

26
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,759
So...
a holidaymaker?

27
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,989
Well, not for sure. It's about
20-80 residents to guests.

28
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,550
Right, good.
Well done.

29
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,229
So all in hand, then?

30
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,040
Yeah, we're on fire, aren't we?

31
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,699
So to speak.

32
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,109
The message she left was a
bit muffled, so it's...

33
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,619
Adrian what?

34
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,980
No, Aiden.

35
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,140
Right.

36
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,680
Aiden.

37
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,239
I'm guessing this one's the body.

38
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,399
Yep.
She had no chance.

39
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,990
- She?
- They can tell, from what I gather.

40
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,779
And there was no-one
in either of these?

41
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,539
No, he's on an early delivery,
luckily.

42
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,840
We've gone to pick him up.

43
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,119
- So, was there an explosion?
- Yeah.

44
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,500
Water's heated by an LPG tank.

45
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,199
- They know what triggered that?
- We do.

46
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,500
This one.

47
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,279
If you'd like to step through
to the kitchen diner, madam.

48
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,430
Might not want to inhale.

49
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,290
Cannabis.

50
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,720
No wonder you're all so relaxed.

51
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,879
Have Fire confirmed
this as the source?

52
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,809
Given me a "highly likely".

53
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,310
They think a spark was carried
from here to the others.

54
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,849
How much is this?
Personal supply

55
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,319
plus some for your mates?

56
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,449
Yeah, this level of wattage
on the system says amateurs.

57
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,159
I mean, what moron would leave
500 watts by an LPG tank?

58
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,599
The kind of moron that wants
to cause an explosion.

59
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,759
Just go for the tank
direct, wouldn't you?

60
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,679
Why would you wait
for a burn-out?

61
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,859
Give you a chance to get out.

62
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,819
You're thinking deliberate?

63
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,720
No, I'm thinking... I don't know.

64
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,370
Bar a crack of lightning, could
have been anything set it off.

65
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,910
Marcus.

66
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,589
I wouldn't just yet.

67
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,079
I know female.
That's about it.

68
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,699
I got female.

69
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,599
- Age?
- Over 20, best guess.

70
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,459
So, died before or during the fire?

71
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,469
Well, the body was found in bed.

72
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,559
There's no sign she
tried to escape.

73
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,169
There's no apparent
blood stains,

74
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,670
no obvious trauma wounds.

75
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,159
Unless they're on the other side, it
looks like during the fire she was...

76
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,159
Can you get to the underside now?

77
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,920
- No, that's not possible.
- Got you.

78
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,000
Leave you to it, then.

79
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,559
Right, treat as a major incident,

80
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,620
suspicious until we find otherwise.

81
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,560
No more bodies on site, they reckon.

82
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
Canisters in every one.

83
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,980
Could have wiped out
the whole place.

84
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,839
- Close shave.
- Not for someone, it wasn't.

85
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,500
Not for someone.

86
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,959
Any intelligence
on drug dealing?

87
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,339
Not on the radar as yet, but just
been on the phone to Community.

88
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,559
CSOs were up here last night
to support noise abatement.

89
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,460
Stag party gone wild.

90
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,339
- Did we bag this lot up?
- I'll find out.

91
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,009
Do you want it processed for DNA?

92
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,639
- Yeah. Why not?
- Oh, my. What on earth...?

93
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,959
- Who's that? Is that the owner?
- No.

94
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,779
Owner's en route from Netherfield.

95
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,539
That fella's just back from his
shift to find himself homeless.

96
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,840
He lived next door.

97
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,619
This tree was a memorial for my wife.

98
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,620
'Ey, I'm sorry, love.

99
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,879
This was our place. Look at it.

100
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,830
20 years up in smoke.

101
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,669
Well, at least
you're in one piece.

102
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,659
They kept me awake so
I went into work early.

103
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,029
I never do that.

104
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,999
What's this?
The stag party?

105
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,079
I'd shouted at them, but...

106
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,380
If they hadn't...

107
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,649
Is it their bonfire?
Is that what it was?

108
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,119
We don't know,
love.

109
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,550
Do you know who they were?

110
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,719
I'd know 'em by sight
if I saw a picture.

111
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,260
Yeah. Did you know the deceased?

112
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,680
- You what?
- 'Ey, I'm sorry, love.

113
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,479
Your neighbour?

114
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,880
What? No.

115
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,439
No, no, there are no
neighbours this side.

116
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,119
We found a body, a woman.

117
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,439
- Who?
- Dunno.

118
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,740
I thought we'd just lost things.

119
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,839
Well, I'm sorry for the
things you've lost, sir.

120
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,880
This way, sir, please.

121
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,429
Right, check with his company

122
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,559
what time blokey here
started his deliveries.

123
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,790
We're gonna need
descriptions of the stags.

124
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,439
Is that him owns the park?

125
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,209
Yeah,
he's been at Netherfield Hall.

126
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,019
Jim Viner.
Daughter's Claire.

127
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,679
- Netherfield? Is that that spa place?
- Spa and golf, I think.

128
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,980
Right.

129
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,039
- Mr. Viner, DCI Vera Stanhope.
- Did a guest die? Is that right?

130
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,390
Er, there has been
a fatality, sir, yes.

131
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,939
But those two I don't even let.

132
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,790
They haven't had the upgrade.

133
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,149
- It's not Malcolm, is it?
- No, he's been accounted for.

134
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,709
He was on an early shift.
Matching to the guest list,

135
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,369
the person we couldn't
place is Sally MacCarrol.

136
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,529
No, Sally's not a guest.
She lives here.

137
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,909
- Do you want me to ring her?
- Please, love.

138
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,059
- Have you asked Deena?
- Who's Deena?

139
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,970
My sister.
She'll know. Come on.

140
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,900
Deena!

141
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,490
Are you awake?

142
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,500
Where's her stuff?

143
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,399
Dad, what if she took herself
off into a chalet?

144
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,180
She couldn't have.
That was all talk.

145
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,999
Still voicemail, I'm afraid.

146
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,339
Dad, Sally's not picking up either.

147
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,640
All done.

148
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,409
OK, let's not panic.

149
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,280
They're probably
just both down the Metro.

150
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,559
Is it possible either of them could
have gone off somewhere together?

151
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,959
Last-minute sort of thing?

152
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,059
Actually, yeah, that's a
good thought. Could be that.

153
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,959
So them being absent isn't
really out of character?

154
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,169
No. I mean, they're both single.

155
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,800
They both stop out sometimes.

156
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,450
This is them, if it helps.

157
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,529
That one's Deena.
The one on the left.

158
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,989
Right.
So she's what?

159
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,360
- Late 20s?
- 34.

160
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,999
- Can I hang on to this, love?
- Yeah.

161
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,559
How long have they been mates?

162
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,479
Er, well, since Sally came,
so that's about eight months.

163
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,319
Do either of them work on Sundays?

164
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,799
Well, Sally might.
She's a carer.

165
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,639
I've the name somewhere.

166
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,279
But Deena doesn't.
She...

167
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,519
She helps here sometimes
with the changeovers,

168
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,919
but she doesn't have a...
you know, a job job.

169
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,710
So she's unemployed?

170
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,759
Now, why do you think she might
have moved into a chalet?

171
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,839
Well, she just talked about it.

172
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,859
Yeah,
but she wanted a deluxe job,

173
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,369
not to slum it up the hill.

174
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,090
Yeah, but it's possible she could
have moved into an empty one.

175
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,180
Well, it's possible, yeah, but...

176
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,580
Try her again, Claire.

177
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,079
Have you got a stag party
staying at the park?

178
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,419
We're not on that circuit,
thank God.

179
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,329
Only we had reports
of one kicking off.

180
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,939
Unless it were Ryan's lot.

181
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,499
No, they were going into town.

182
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,619
- Who's Ryan?
- Her fella.

183
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,879
His stag was last night.

184
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,750
They're not gonna
come here, are they?

185
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,599
He DJs on the side.
He can get in anywhere.

186
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,519
- Well, have you spoken to him, love?
- I've left messages.

187
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,960
He's probably sleeping it off.

188
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,750
Look, can I not just see this body
and get it over and done with?

189
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,560
We'd rather deal with
it via DNA, sir.

190
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,379
And I'm sorry,
I'm gonna have to ask,

191
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,359
is there anything
you can tell us

192
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,900
that might help
us with ID?

193
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,810
Well, what about her bracelet?

194
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,610
It...
it's got a bird on it.

195
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,070
We got it for her 30th.
She never takes it off.

196
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,179
Why didn't you ask
about the cannabis?

197
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,380
Because I want to
see if they tell me.

198
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,850
- Are you new to murder?
- No.

199
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,879
Been on firearms, gun crime, drugs.

200
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,460
Plenty of bodies.

201
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,380
This it?

202
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,519
Yeah, that's a bird.

203
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,199
Do you want me to break
it to the family?

204
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,179
No, I don't,
not without DNA confirmation,

205
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,489
not when there's
another person missing.

206
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,489
These things may be ten a penny.

207
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,849
She might have given
it to her mate.

208
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,609
The day she died? That's
a bit of a coincidence?

209
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,860
Aye. And so is moving into
a chalet that gets burnt down.

210
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,489
Sorry. They're going to
cut out the wall there.

211
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,360
That's the only way we can get her out.

212
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,380
Hang on. That's the
outside of the door.

213
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,400
Someone had locked her in.

214
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,949
First priority, the lass
on the right here.

215
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,829
Sally MacCarrol, missing person.

216
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,369
Now, we've got teams scouring
the nearby undergrowth,

217
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,809
so fingers crossed we
don't find another body.

218
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,719
Now, the other first priority...

219
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,089
is the lass here, possible
murder inquiry.

220
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,319
Now, this is Deena Viner,

221
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,910
thought to be the body found
in the burnt-out chalet.

222
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,230
Cause of death as yet unknown.

223
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,369
Actually, Marcus just called.

224
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,729
Blood's carboxylated
indicating smoke inhalation.

225
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,039
So died in the fire.

226
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,079
He won't say until he's
in the lungs, but yeah.

227
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,479
Right, so cause of death:
smoke inhalation.

228
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,669
Cause of the fire:

229
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,279
thought to be a burn-out

230
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,789
from a lighting rig in
the adjacent chalet,

231
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,969
being used as a cannabis factory.

232
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,539
I say factory, I mean
cottage industry.

233
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,950
However, she was locked in.

234
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,959
Why and by whom?

235
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,449
Who had access to the keys?

236
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,349
Does that mean the burn-out
was deliberate?

237
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,130
And who was growing the
cannabis? And who knew?

238
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,429
- Where are we with the stags?
- Groom is Ryan Synnott.

239
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,899
Ryan Synnott?
That the daughter's bloke?

240
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,559
Yeah.
Dad owns the Seven Sisters pub.

241
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,459
Lives there,
by Mileside Beach.

242
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,209
That's not trouble, is it, Ken?

243
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,619
- No.
- Stag party are staying there,

244
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,879
but they got a minibus
up country early doors.

245
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,489
- Any other background?
- Other noise complaints,

246
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,869
- handled by the council.
- And the owner of the caravan park,

247
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,469
Jim, was spoken to by Community
about six months back.

248
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,349
Spoken to?

249
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,359
What does that mean
when it's at home?

250
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,169
It just says, "Spoken to
on Parkinthorpe Cliffs".

251
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,679
No other info.

252
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,349
It's a site for al-fresco lovemaking.

253
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,499
Oh, trust you. Go there
often, do you, Kenny?

254
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,469
Check it out.
I'll be right.

255
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,469
Owner and daughter were out of town
for the duration, weren't they?

256
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,569
Car doesn't budge
from Netherfield Hall

257
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,929
from Friday lunch until we pick
'em up.

258
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,059
Hotel's got him on
the Wi-Fi in his room

259
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,409
and the daughter's
in the bar until two.

260
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,939
Doesn't matter.

261
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,719
It's bound to be
an insurance jobby.

262
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,779
Nine out of ten fires
are all about money.

263
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,589
Now, you have a point.

264
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,880
Kenny, check the family,
the money, the business.

265
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,839
Ma'am.

266
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,910
- What about CCTV? Anything?
- Yes.

267
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,659
Cameras in reception.

268
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,869
That's all we've got of her.

269
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,299
Pack of paracetamol, half empty.

270
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,559
This is, what, 12 hours
before she died?

271
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,039
Looks happy enough, doesn't she?

272
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,719
Ma'am, the stags are
on Hattington Sands.

273
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,099
Right.
Come on, Sergeant.

274
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,400
We're going to the beach.

275
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,100
Come out!

276
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,380
- Come out!
- Get out!

277
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,480
Come on!

278
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,529
There were about five of them. One
of them I've seen about quite a bit.

279
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,399
Look, I don't want to tell tales,
but his name's Ryan Synnott.

280
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,910
Goes out with Jim's
daughter, I think.

281
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,259
Did you see Deena at all?
Or Sally MacCarrol?

282
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,569
No.

283
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,539
No, I wouldn't have called the
police if I'd seen Deena with them,

284
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,840
cos I'm fond of her.

285
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,320
Is that why they burnt me down?

286
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,199
Cos I called you lot.

287
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,500
- Well, is Claire all right?
- I think they're pretty shocked.

288
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,650
She tried ringing me. I just
thought she were fussing.

289
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,039
Was it a regular?

290
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,099
Well, Claire's Aunt Deena

291
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,099
is unaccounted for,

292
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,889
as is her friend,
a Sally MacCarrol.

293
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,999
Yeah, they were with us.
We met them at the pub.

294
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,159
Well... So, can you say
where you last saw them?

295
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,470
Yeah, it was at the park.

296
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,649
We met them there
after the Sisters.

297
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,519
Right. So it was definitely
your lot, then,

298
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,070
the bonfire.

299
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,520
We must have left it burning.

300
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,160
I'm so sorry.

301
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,249
Is it my fault?

302
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,600
That's what we're trying to
find out. How did you get that?

303
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,499
Brained myself showing off
in the pool, ended up in A&E.

304
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,479
Look, if I left it to burn,
if it's my fault...

305
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,609
We're nice lads, not yobs.

306
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,439
How much had you
been drinking?

307
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,079
Started downstairs at
the Sisters about eight.

308
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,539
Then, after closing,

309
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,149
moved on to the caravan park,
so a lot.

310
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,639
Why not go to town?
Wasn't that the plan?

311
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,209
We bumped into some
lasses Ryan knew.

312
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,819
It was one of their ideas.

313
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,079
Seemed better than
some sweaty club.

314
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,949
Did you go up to the park
for any other reason?

315
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,250
No...

316
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,760
Deena just kept nagging
us so we just gave in.

317
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,119
How much had she been drinking?

318
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,879
To be honest, she can
be pretty hyper, so...

319
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,879
It's hard to say.

320
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,889
It wasn't
anything mental, though.

321
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,329
The guy that got upset,
he was just overreacting.

322
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,089
Deena went off somewhere.

323
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,940
Sally went to bed. I went home.

324
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,359
And the rest just took Ben to A&E.

325
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,660
So,

326
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,089
you might have been
the last person

327
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,389
to see Sally or Deena alive.

328
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,690
No...

329
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,660
- Sally's not dead.
- How do you know that?

330
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,469
Does this...

331
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,100
Does this have to come out?

332
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,760
Excuse me.

333
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,550
- Claire, what are you doing?
- Riley, move!

334
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,800
Claire.
Claire, hey, wait!

335
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,760
- Claire...
- Don't.

336
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,240
- She's beaten us to it.
- Claire, wait.

337
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,680
Claire, are you all right?

338
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,810
Look at me.

339
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,039
Sally's up there.

340
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,360
She's...
She's fine.

341
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,290
It's Ryan.

342
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,670
I don't want to talk to him.

343
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,950
- And you are?
- I'm Riley.

344
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,959
He's Ryan's brother.

345
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,279
Yeah?

346
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,980
We'll get you a car home, love.

347
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,279
Where are you heading?

348
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,200
Back to the park.

349
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,719
<i>Meanwhile, holidaymakers
in the park have suggested</i>

350
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,639
<i>the body of a woman was found</i>

351
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,209
<i>not long after the fire service
brought the blaze under control.</i>

352
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,980
Sally MacCarrol?

353
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,620
DCI Vera Stanhope. Can we
have a little chat, love?

354
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,959
It's not Deena, is it?

355
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,429
Well, we're still awaiting
DNA confirmation on the body.

356
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,139
But I checked in on her.

357
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,429
It said she was on Mileside Beach
eight o'clock this morning.

358
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,739
Look it up.

359
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,939
Well, the person we found
was dead before that.

360
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,941
I've got this app.
I made her put it on

361
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:18,309
in Ibiza in case
we got separated.

362
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,250
Look.
She's here somewhere.

363
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,249
- She'll have come to find me.
- Well, ring it.

364
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,550
Right.

365
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,180
Don't touch.

366
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,450
- Whose room is this?
- Ryan's.

367
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,169
And was Deena in here
with you at any point?

368
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,209
No, we were in the bar.

369
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,899
How did this get here, then?

370
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,480
Pathology have got a confirm
on the DNA. It's her.

371
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,910
Sorry, love.

372
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,459
Who else has access
to the chalet keys?

373
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,359
All the staff plus me
and Claire and Deena.

374
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,589
And Sally.
She mucks in occasionally.

375
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,989
They're in a cabinet.

376
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,139
We'll have to take
that away for examination.

377
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,859
When did you arrive
at the hotel?

378
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,849
We left here Friday morning.

379
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:36,299
It was a two-night thing. We're
having the wedding there.

380
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,619
Claire gets a freebie.
Like a...

381
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,239
A weekend for the bride and
the mother of the bride.

382
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,239
My wife's not around,
so... so I went.

383
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,060
- Where is your wife?
- Died 2003.

384
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,910
I told Claire two
nights was too much.

385
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,970
What happened?

386
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,280
Dad.

387
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,079
They've done the DNA.

388
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,380
It's her.

389
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,990
Right.

390
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,679
Are we sure it's not a mix-up?

391
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,799
Because why she was up there...

392
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,439
I'm sorry, sir.

393
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,740
It's our belief that
your sister has died.

394
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,860
Dad.

395
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,370
It's OK.
I'm all right.

396
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,379
Right, get on to a magistrate. I
want that pub thoroughly searched.

397
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,769
See if we can link anything
more than the phone to Ryan.

398
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,439
- OK.
- Oh, Bethany, have we checked the insurance?

399
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,919
Yeah, it's public liability only.

400
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,400
He won't get back a penny.

401
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,939
What are you doing, love?

402
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,689
I'm sorry.
I know you're busy.

403
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,159
- But I need to know something.
- Right. What's that?

404
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,039
Was it electrics?
The fire?

405
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,449
No.
Why do you ask?

406
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,679
Well, Ryan keeps his stuff in there.

407
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,279
My dad don't know but I let him.

408
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,999
What do you mean, exactly? Stuff?

409
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,499
He grows weed.

410
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,709
And if it set something off,

411
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,170
I don't want to cover for him.

412
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,780
Right.
Thanks, love.

413
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,209
Motive.
What have we got?

414
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,269
Ryan Synnott let it
burn out to destroy it.

415
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,069
Deena was collateral damage.

416
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,969
You don't destroy a personal supply.

417
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,479
Maybe he panicked
when the PC showed up.

418
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,999
What? To the crack squad
at noise abatement?

419
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,519
I don't buy it. Anyway,
why was she locked in?

420
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,389
- I dunno. You tell us.
- Deena knew too much.

421
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,859
- About what?
- About the pair of 'em, their affair.

422
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,059
- Well, who says she gave a damn?
- Deena was her auntie.

423
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,219
That means nothing.
Not her mam, is it?

424
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,999
However, one of the stags, Ben,

425
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,550
said she was gobbing off about
people cheating on her.

426
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,919
Now he tells us.

427
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,729
- Any other nuggets?
- She gets shirty about it.

428
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,329
They lock her in to shut her up.

429
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,509
Go and do
the dirty, forget they've left the lights on.

430
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,130
- Oh, full of theories, aren't you?
- Someone's got to be.

431
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,659
- Bethany, you can go and interview Ryan.
- Yeah?

432
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,879
And get me the blood results
on alcohol levels.

433
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,480
Mark, DNA on the key.

434
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,359
And you can get down to this hospice
Sally claims to have worked at.

435
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,879
- Can I not come and interview her?
- No, you cannot.

436
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,339
We need some background on the
woman. Somebody's got to do it.

437
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,289
- Anything specific?
- If we knew that,

438
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,000
we wouldn't have to look.

439
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,949
- She doesn't like them cheeky.
- I'll bear that in mind.

440
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,900
Don't worry. First three
years are the hardest.

441
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,260
Dad.

442
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,480
Just give me a minute.

443
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,299
<i>Had you planned it,
the lads coming back?</i>

444
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,609
No. Sort of.

445
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,790
She knew the stags
would be at the pub.

446
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,249
She wanted to have a pool
party, like we did in Ibiza.

447
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,359
So you hadn't arranged it
with the lads beforehand?

448
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,959
No.

449
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,750
She talked 'em into it.

450
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,210
We came back.
A bit of skinny-dipping.

451
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,950
Then I lost track of her.

452
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,260
- I thought she'd crashed out.
- Did you know she'd moved into a chalet?

453
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,980
Yeah.

454
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,619
I think she wanted
her own space.

455
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,959
Why's that?

456
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,250
Just to have it, I think.

457
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,870
I mean, Jim's a nice bloke, but...

458
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,559
.. he hovered.

459
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,999
That's the word she used.

460
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,520
I don't think it was
a big issue, though.

461
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,909
So, you went skinny-dipping,
she disappeared and then what?

462
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,690
You went back to the pub
with Ryan. Is that right?

463
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,279
It was a one-off.

464
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,590
We haven't been seeing
each other or anything.

465
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,239
Did Deena know what you were up to?

466
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,439
- Yeah.
- What did she think about that?

467
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,330
She turned a blind eye.

468
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,859
She was hacked off
with Jim and Claire

469
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,660
for not taking her to the hotel.

470
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,650
How much had she been drinking?

471
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,220
She wasn't a big drinker.

472
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,890
I've got witnesses saying
she was all over the shop.

473
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,559
- I don't think it was the booze.
- Cannabis?

474
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,370
No, no.
God, no.

475
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,959
She was feeling rough

476
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,869
so I gave her some of
my migraine tablets.

477
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:37,079
They're quite strong.
That and a Night Nurse.

478
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,679
She was dead set on going out.

479
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,980
I think...

480
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,999
Maybe it reacted with something.

481
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,639
Did you know she'd already dosed
herself up on paracetamol?

482
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,940
No.

483
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,240
No, I didn't.

484
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,270
Is that why she didn't wake up?

485
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,560
Who said she didn't wake up, love?

486
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,460
Good morning.

487
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,820
We spoke earlier.

488
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,070
I'm here to see the warden.

489
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,360
DS Healy?

490
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,889
I understand Sally MacCarrol
was an employee of yours.

491
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,949
Yes, that's right. For a while, yes.

492
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,209
- How long was she here for?
- Well, now...

493
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:27,899
sadly we had to let her
go about eight months ago.

494
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,039
She said she was NVQ
qualified and she wasn't.

495
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,450
Right.
So she was sacked?

496
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,100
No...

497
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,579
One of the patients she was caring
for left her some money.

498
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,230
It wasn't a huge amount but...

499
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,359
the family seemed to think that
something untoward had gone on.

500
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,519
It soured the atmosphere.

501
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,229
So, what happened to the money?

502
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,999
I asked her to return it.

503
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,990
She refused.
We parted company.

504
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,710
Thank you.
Thank you for your time. OK.

505
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,869
There's no significant
alcohol intake.

506
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,359
Right. So what was
making her act up?

507
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,029
Was it the medication?

508
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,039
It's not really psychotropic.

509
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,799
It's there, but at a low level.

510
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,810
- What about other recreational?
- No, no trace.

511
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,039
Come on, Marcus.

512
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,339
You're one of the few I can rely
on to come up with the goods.

513
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,960
I've gone up the league, then.

514
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,399
Well, how's Joe getting on?

515
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,560
Oh, he doesn't want
me checking up on him.

516
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,130
He's got Celine to do that.

517
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,570
Nah, he's moved on.

518
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,619
So, can I at least have
confirmation, cause of death?

519
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,990
All right.

520
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,779
I knew the tanks were risky.

521
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,469
I'm sorry.
I thought I'd been careful.

522
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,180
Why was this in your room?

523
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,879
She just left it at the bar.
I was just gonna pass it on.

524
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,740
But the app puts her phone
on the beach at 8am.

525
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,329
I wouldn't know anything about
that. I was surfing at the time.

526
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,180
So it just returned itself to your
room, put itself back in the drawer?

527
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,829
I mean,
I know they're clever,

528
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,620
but teleportation?

529
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,970
Well, then, I'd have to say,
"No comment".

530
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,990
I'll be with you in a jiffy,
pet.

531
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,779
He's sorry.

532
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,839
He said he was careful
cos he knew it was risky.

533
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,140
So that's all right, then.

534
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,389
Has he fessed up?

535
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,509
No, he's just given it "no comment".

536
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,510
Is he protecting someone?

537
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,979
Well,
ask him about him and Sally.

538
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,279
Maybe it runs deeper than a one-off.

539
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,230
Ma'am, there's a partial
match for Sally on the key,

540
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,679
but also for other
people who had access

541
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,919
plus persons unknown, so...

542
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,010
So you're telling me
nothing? Brilliant.

543
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,279
Ma'am, DS Healy on line one.

544
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,700
Who?
What does he want?

545
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,489
Yes.

546
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,149
She's done a regular
cash payment

547
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:17,849
to both an S MacCarrol
and an R Synnott.

548
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,989
Kenny, you were right.
Fire, always money.

549
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,859
Plus, she wrote to the
manager here a while back

550
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,279
saying to give Sally
access to her bank account

551
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,849
in the event of her death.

552
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:31,259
<i>So was I right to send</i>
you down there or what?

553
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,080
Get it all back here.

554
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,020
You're welcome.

555
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,319
Was it for weed?

556
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,039
No, I don't sell it.

557
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,959
So,
why was she giving you money?

558
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,559
- We've seen her bank statements.
- I didn't know that she was.

559
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,749
I don't find that plausible, Ryan.

560
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,559
- Are you protecting someone?
- No.

561
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,410
- Are you protecting Sally?
- No.

562
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,570
Why was she giving you money?

563
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,690
She was helping me out.

564
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,560
Only, in this letter
she wrote to the bank

565
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,829
she asked for it to continue

566
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,810
in the event of her death.

567
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,779
There was nothing in that.

568
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,589
No, that was just
her being daft.

569
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,900
Well, that's a big gesture.
Only known her eight months.

570
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,250
That's just what she was like.

571
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,009
So,
what was on her mind,

572
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,180
do you think,
when she wrote this?

573
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,220
In my last job...

574
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,839
a patient had left
me some money and...

575
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,070
she knew it had helped me out
so she was just copying that.

576
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Did she know you got the sack?

577
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,580
No.

578
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,829
I felt ashamed.

579
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,839
Plus you were unqualified,
of course.

580
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,959
Now, here's a thing.

581
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,760
Someone had locked
Deena into her chalet.

582
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,980
What?

583
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,050
Yeah.

584
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,500
- No!
- Yes.

585
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,799
- Who?
- Well, you tell me, love.

586
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,709
Well, it wasn't me.
Why would I do that?

587
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,689
Well, one reason might be

588
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,249
so you could cop off
with Ryan undisturbed.

589
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,509
- I wouldn't do that.
- Or another reason might be

590
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,069
you locked her in
to keep her safe,

591
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,989
stop her legging it to the pool
while you were copping off.

592
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,359
- I still wouldn't do that.
- Wouldn't you, love?

593
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,400
She was my mate.

594
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,999
The money Deena
gets once a month,

595
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,119
not from work, a trust fund?

596
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,560
A trust fund?

597
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,809
- Not millionaires, are they?
- What, a lottery win?

598
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,399
DS Healy?

599
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,529
I knew you'd find something.

600
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,880
- Well done.
- You got enough to charge either of them?

601
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,399
Well, that depends what Mark
has for us from Forensics.

602
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,759
Well, they can't pretend
it was an accident.

603
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,719
That's one thing.
Traces of accelerant,

604
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,980
probably petrol,
found in front of the chalets.

605
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,759
OK, I'll get samples from
all suspect vehicles.

606
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,519
Right,
and their clothes from the night.

607
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,820
Ma'am.

608
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,070
No, hang on, hang on.

609
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,560
Accelerant?

610
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,429
That means it wasn't a
slow burn, as we thought.

611
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,259
I mean, the fire could only
have been started 20 minutes

612
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,139
before the fire
brigade were called.

613
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,009
- So after six.
- Right.

614
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:24,450
So who can we place at
the park around six, hm?

615
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,919
Apart from 500 holidaymakers.

616
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,679
Couldn't say for definite.

617
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,639
I mean, the time line from
the stags has inconsistencies.

618
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,540
Have we got any witness at
all who wasn't off their face?

619
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,660
Was there a designated driver?

620
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,799
Hello, love.

621
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,469
The boss is out.
He's back at five.

622
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:03,490
Are you the driver of the
stag do from Seven Sisters?

623
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,109
Yeah.

624
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,319
Overnight booking,
that correct?

625
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,309
So, where did you go after
leaving the caravan park

626
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,410
and dropping them back at the pub?

627
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,729
A&E.

628
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,909
The tall one hit himself on the pool.

629
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,369
- Did they all go?
- Yeah, all of them.

630
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,719
No, no, not the one who
was getting... You know.

631
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,479
- The one with the girl.
- Do you know where they went?

632
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,559
Yeah, I dropped 'em off at the pub.

633
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,959
Did you see them again after that?

634
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,919
Yeah, yeah, in the window.

635
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,629
The others woke
'em up to get back in.

636
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,199
And what time was that?

637
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,760
Well, I was back here
for 6:45, so 6am-ish.

638
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,199
How were they as a group?

639
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,629
Compared to what I've
seen? Small fry.

640
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,270
Bit of a spray, invoice for the
damage. There's no harm done.

641
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,729
Yeah, it's...

642
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:00,460
Well, it's my insurance, in case
the boss thinks it was my fault.

643
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,940
It's here somewhere.

644
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,759
There you go.

645
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,719
<i>Come on, pool party!</i>

646
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,800
- 10:30. Is that right?
- Yeah.

647
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,879
Five minutes later, she was here.

648
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,049
<i>Go on, get out of my
sight. I hate you!</i>

649
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,969
Did you see who
she was talking to?

650
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,369
No, I just wanted her to get down.

651
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,749
She starts crying.

652
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,239
Normally,
the groom's the one in tears.

653
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,889
And did she say what
she was upset about?

654
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,949
Break-up with her boyfriend.

655
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,569
I don't think it was serious.

656
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,680
How did we miss a boyfriend?

657
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,329
How did we miss a boyfriend, hm?

658
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,839
The family never mentioned one.

659
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,209
- Mates didn't mention one.
- Driver could be wrong.

660
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,659
Why conceal it from your friends
and family? She's a grown woman.

661
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,880
Grown woman? She was bouncing
off the top of a limo.

662
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,399
She's 34, still living
with her brother.

663
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,750
I mean, that's a bit...

664
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,130
.. odd, isn't it?

665
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,259
Even these days.

666
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,780
Then there's that letter
she wrote to the bank.

667
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,619
What do you want to do
with Sally and Ryan?

668
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,309
Release or keep for
another 24 hours?

669
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:32,390
Well, we can't place
them at the fire.

670
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,919
So get Kenny to release her

671
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,800
and charge him for intent
to supply cannabis.

672
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,499
- Have we checked Facebook?
- The boffins are on it.

673
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,770
Password on everything thus far
has been Effron, so with any luck.

674
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,999
Ask Sally MacCarrol

675
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,829
if Deena has a boyfriend
under wraps.

676
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,739
And get him to press Marcus
for sexual activity.

677
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,049
Hear that?

678
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,950
Don't think she
meant it that way.

679
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,229
They found two tickets for
the cinema on her phone,

680
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,279
Friday week.
Edwards has gone down there.

681
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,159
Right, well,
anything to build a picture.

682
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,859
It doesn't give us the why,
though, does it?

683
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,319
I mean, why kill some
girl out on the lash?

684
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,979
Listen, it's not easy getting
into the head of a killer.

685
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,489
They don't think the way we do.
That's the problem.

686
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,960
Actually...

687
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,740
You're gonna hear this, so
I should probably tell you.

688
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,899
A couple of years back...
I shot a dealer.

689
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,379
Yeah, I know you did.

690
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,399
Waiting to see if I'd tell you?

691
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,559
- You're getting the hang of it.
- He had a gun.

692
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,670
I know, I read the report.
Self-defence, proportionate force.

693
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,510
Not that we let the criminals
get away with that, mind.

694
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,250
You coming or what?

695
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,810
Deena could have been
lying, of course.

696
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,930
Or the limo driver could have
got the wrong end of the stick.

697
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,229
Anyway, let's keep pushing
with the accelerant,

698
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,000
see what that gives us.

699
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,479
What?

700
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,039
The cinema ticket bloke
recognised the photo.

701
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,699
Said she comes regular as clockwork,
once a week, with her little brother.

702
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,080
With her little brother?

703
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,279
What happened to the boyfriend?

704
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,479
- Are you sure?
- That's what he said.

705
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,909
He said they watch all the new
releases the day they come out.

706
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,210
Big fans.

707
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,459
And did Deena tell him
it was her little brother

708
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,539
or was that just the
ticket fella's assumption?

709
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,519
What she said. I double-checked.

710
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,020
A list of Deena's
text messages, ma'am.

711
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,909
Brace yourself. I believe they're
what they call saucy.

712
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,680
Well, I don't know what it
is you're reading, Kenny.

713
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,129
"Glad you liked it. There's
more if you want it."

714
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,820
Mind like a sewer.

715
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:59,650
"Glad you liked it."
What's it? A gift?

716
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,909
12th.
Did she buy anything on the 12th?

717
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:07,109
There's an email showing a
receipt from an online store.

718
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,879
Electrical goods, ֲ£344.

719
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,119
Well, get onto the store,
see what costs ֲ£344.

720
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,820
Xbox or iPad.

721
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,990
One-nil to the overgrown schoolboy!

722
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,599
That cash transfer to R Synnott,

723
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,950
- how do we know that's Ryan?
- We don't.

724
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,060
We don't.

725
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,349
Riley's in there

726
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,759
and there's a barman that said
he'll be his responsible adult.

727
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,800
- Yeah, well, he'll do.
- Yeah, the boffins have played a blinder.

728
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,319
2:30×m she changes
her Facebook status

729
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,659
on her laptop in the chalet.

730
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,680
"In a relationship
with Riley Synnott."

731
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,349
Ma'am!

732
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:56,100
Gets deleted off her mobile
0800 the next day.

733
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,630
I just thought, the statement
Malcolm Raggert gave me,

734
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,449
where he describes a lad,
17-ish,

735
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,750
on site at about 4×m.

736
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,449
Right. Get Raggert in to do an ID.

737
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,850
- Ma'am.
- Thanks, Ken.

738
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,139
So, do you want to tell
us about Deena Viner?

739
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,329
We were just mates, really.

740
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,719
We'd see films and stuff.

741
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,560
It was just a laugh.

742
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,280
Why was she putting money
into your bank account?

743
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,630
I was... I was giving
her driving lessons.

744
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,799
17? You got a licence?

745
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,109
No.

746
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,929
Why didn't she pay cash?

747
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,860
I'm saving up to go travelling.

748
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,199
Driving lessons? Kept that
quiet. It's first we've heard.

749
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,429
Yeah, well, she said
not to tell her brother.

750
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,909
- Why?
- I don't know.

751
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:53,279
She said she weren't
allowed to drive.

752
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,199
- Why not?
- I dunno. I didn't ask.

753
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,600
I just...

754
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,870
I just took the money.

755
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,039
Why did she tell people you
were her little brother?

756
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,839
I don't know.

757
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,240
It was...

758
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,479
It was just a joke,
you know. She's...

759
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,859
Oh, I can't describe it. She's...

760
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:16,430
She's funny,
in a good way.

761
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,889
Tell us about Facebook.

762
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,219
I think she put a little
message on there for you.

763
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,410
All of a sudden,
puff, it's gone.

764
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,949
I deleted it.

765
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,750
What did you do with the phone?

766
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,100
I put it in Ryan's room
to give to Claire.

767
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,510
Have a little look at this.

768
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,250
<i>Get out!
Go on, get out of my sight!</i>

769
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:43,139
Now, who's she shouting at?

770
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,470
I've asked all the others but
none of them seem to know.

771
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,559
She invited me back with her.

772
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,400
Said she wanted to show me
she'd got her own place.

773
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,359
I wasn't...

774
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,149
I wasn't
sure if she meant...

775
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,119
you know, but I had
to put her straight.

776
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,100
All right?
She's too old.

777
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,159
I was... I was just being nice.

778
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,850
I was... I was just
helping her driving.

779
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,530
Do you recognise any of these lads?

780
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,959
Anything there?

781
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,070
- Go back.
- OK.

782
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,399
That's the lad there.

783
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,239
- You sure?
- Yeah.

784
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,759
- You at the stag do?
- No.

785
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,319
No?

786
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,019
Only I've got a witness saying
he saw you at the caravan park.

787
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,399
- So were you at the stag do at the bonfire?
- Yeah... yeah.

788
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,119
I... Well...

789
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,279
No, I wasn't invited.

790
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,969
I went up later to
give her her phone back.

791
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:50,390
That's nice of you.
What time was that?

792
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,590
About...
About six-ish.

793
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,409
Six-ish?

794
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,829
That's a bit early
for a lad your age, isn't it?

795
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:00,639
I wanted to apologise.

796
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,079
And did you?

797
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,559
No. No, no.
I looked for her.

798
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,159
I knew she'd moved into
this cabin up the hill.

799
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,459
When I knocked, it was
just some old bloke.

800
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,779
- What, Malcolm Raggert?
- I don't know his name. He...

801
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,739
He just shouted at me and said
he'd call you lot again.

802
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,840
There's... There's really
nothing else to tell you.

803
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,629
He sees she's put it on
Facebook.

804
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,239
He freaks out.

805
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,319
He goes back to
the caravan park.

806
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,079
There's a massive confrontation.

807
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,539
Nicks her phone, torches the place.

808
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,259
What, kills her in
anger cos of Facebook?

809
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,959
Humiliation,
loss of face.

810
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,350
Oh, come on, he's a teenager. This
stuff's life or death to 'em.

811
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,379
He'd have had to have gone all
the way back to the caravan park,

812
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,610
found some chalet he's never clapped
eyes on before, get the accelerant.

813
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,479
Too much planning for
heat of the moment.

814
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,130
Well, it works if we can prove
he's lying about the time.

815
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,519
Ma'am, Marcus wants you at the lab.

816
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,299
He has to show you something.

817
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,180
Ma'am, do you want to bring in Riley?

818
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,450
Look, I could stretch
to heat of the moment

819
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,500
if it was a knife or whatever.

820
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,659
But even with the time
gap...

821
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,200
Nah, leave him be.

822
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,999
Cause of death, please.

823
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,599
And don't tell me hit
by a bolt of lightning.

824
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,559
Well, I've ruled out that. That's
as much as you're getting for now.

825
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,090
- Glad we made the trip.
- However...

826
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,680
I found this metal
plate in her skull.

827
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,300
The scar tissue covered it, so
I missed it first time round.

828
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,449
- Have we got the GP records?
- What do you think?

829
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:01,850
I'll chase them.

830
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,299
So, when was that put there?

831
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,909
Week ago?
Month ago? What?

832
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,350
I'd say decades.

833
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,040
So, at some point,

834
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:14,529
she sustained...
a what?

835
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:16,710
A significant head injury.

836
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,260
That no-one has told us about.

837
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,300
Why?

838
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,299
Well, as bombshells go,
I've had worse.

839
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,249
That's not the bombshell.

840
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,999
- There's no smoke in the lungs.
- I thought the blood results -

841
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,719
I know, but she was sat before
a bonfire, wasn't she?

842
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,720
Look, I said I'd not confirm
until I was 100% sure.

843
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,790
What are you telling me?

844
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,140
Dead before the fire?

845
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,040
Dead before the fire.

846
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,919
<i>Now, the fire didn't kill her</i>

847
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,359
<i>but that doesn't mean
the fire was unrelated.</i>

848
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,360
And until we have cause of death,
everything is back in play.

849
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,559
What's the intelligence
on this brother?

850
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,799
I remember workaholic.
Anything else?

851
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,330
Well, he's not making much
of a profit by the looks.

852
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,859
Wage bill's gone
down to zero since...

853
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,169
eight months back.

854
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,209
What? The park's fully booked.

855
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:35,899
Doesn't matter. He's not
covering his overheads.

856
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,659
I might know why.
I just got an ear-bashing
from Licensing.

857
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:41,379
They wanted to know if booze
was being sold during the fire.

858
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,779
Why do they want to know that?

859
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,089
They took away his alcohol
permit eight months back.

860
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,499
- Rubbish! There's a bar there, brand-new.
- Doesn't matter.

861
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,550
No longer allowed
to sell, apparently.

862
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,190
Well,
there's your profit margin.

863
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,139
Licence was revoked
for underage drinking

864
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,049
after noise issues.

865
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:59,719
They're on a final
warning for closure.

866
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,120
Hang on. There's a receipt
in Deena's file.

867
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,449
300 quid,
booze at a cash and carry.

868
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,999
400 quid,
swimming pool suppliers.

869
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,820
Let me have a look at that.

870
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:15,050
So, was he selling booze on the QT?

871
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,150
She's bailing the business
out on the card.

872
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,899
Does that put him in the frame?

873
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,539
Not really, especially as he's
30 miles away from the scene.

874
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,840
He's got nothing to gain
as there's no insurance.

875
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,180
He's right.
Here.

876
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,499
Unless Deena was the insurance.

877
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,109
Didn't you say
she had a trust fund?

878
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:37,939
There's a lawyer in town. She's
getting us the paperwork.

879
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:41,619
Still, your own sister. You'd
have to be pretty desperate.

880
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,159
Ma'am?

881
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,860
Sorry,
there's an enquiry to Community

882
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:49,220
about the encounter with
Jim on Parkinthorpe Cliffs.

883
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,069
It's a known suicide spot.

884
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:55,599
Not just for lovers,
then, Kenny?

885
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,539
Now, the family didn't disclose
Deena's head injury.

886
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,299
Is that significant?

887
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,200
Here, I've found her neurologist.

888
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,479
Private practice paid
for by the brother, Jim.

889
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,890
Good.

890
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,550
Let's go and see him, then.

891
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,079
<i>Deena Viner had
a head injury.</i>

892
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,049
<i>Yes,
a motorbike smash.</i>

893
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:20,019
Ripped half of her skull.
That's her, isn't it?

894
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,609
- When was the smash?
- I was an SHO,

895
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:24,469
so it would have been late
'90s.

896
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:27,639
Seen her probably once a year since.

897
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,519
Was she on the bike or hit by one?

898
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,259
That I wouldn't know. But
just let me just check.

899
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,819
Would there have been
any lasting damage?

900
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,799
There was some impairment,
not life-changing,

901
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,509
but I would say definitely
left her with delay.

902
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:43,619
What, like learning difficulties?
- - No, not that extreme.

903
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,819
She might strike you
as immature, perhaps.

904
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,699
It damaged the part of the
brain that controls impulses.

905
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,659
- How do you mean?
- Well, she might have gambled

906
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,499
or displayed inappropriate behaviour
but nothing immediately obvious.

907
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,490
Why, has she got herself
into trouble?

908
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,120
Damages to the frontal lobes.

909
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,599
Coma for three weeks.

910
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,150
Fell off the motorbike.

911
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,899
Is there anything else you can tell
us that we can cross-reference?

912
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,259
I mean, presumably she
was riding pillion?

913
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,019
Picked up by paramedics at
a caravan park on the coast.

914
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,519
- Does that help?
- Yeah, that sort of thing.

915
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,990
Driver also treated for a broken arm.

916
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,200
Her brother, Jim Viner.

917
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,969
I suppose, if he was her carer,

918
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:30,179
could that give him
motive to kill her?

919
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,859
Got too much, couldn't cope
with the responsibility.

920
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:36,499
Well, Sally said he hovered.
Does that fit?

921
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,539
It does if he became resentful.

922
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,809
He would have felt guilty at least.

923
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:44,080
Could that trust fund be
compo for the bike accident?

924
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:48,299
Now, that is a good thought.

925
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,350
Well done that man.

926
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,380
Let's go and ask the family
some difficult questions.

927
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,019
No, go on, you enjoy yourselves.

928
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,819
Only a murder scene.

929
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,399
Shut up,
they've paid for their holiday.

930
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,709
They want their money's worth.
I would.

931
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,399
Did you enjoy yours?

932
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,500
That wasn't a holiday.
It was a funeral.

933
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,659
Auntie Vera.

934
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,639
I tell you,
seeing your name

935
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,339
in giant chrysanths
is a bit depressing.

936
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,179
I'm sorry. Were you close?

937
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,750
No, not really.

938
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,979
She used to make me go spudding.

939
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,379
That was my dad's
idea of a holiday.

940
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,739
Right.

941
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,419
Did you get coal for Christmas too?

942
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,049
Yeah, had to dig for
that ourselves an' all.

943
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,729
<i>- Get out!
- No, Dad!</i>

944
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:45,569
- Hold on, is that them?
- Leave it,

945
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,059
- Dad.
- Clear off, now!

946
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:50,189
- Dad, leave it. Dad!
- No, stop!

947
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,350
You set foot in here again,
I'll kill you!

948
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,050
Wedding's off.

949
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,550
What can you tell me
about Deena's accident?

950
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,869
I were only four, so
I don't know about it.

951
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:07,379
Did it not get talked about?

952
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,489
I think everyone just
wanted to move on.

953
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:10,979
How did it affect her?

954
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,579
My mum said a couple
of times it changed her,

955
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,889
made her an handful.

956
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:17,449
But they were just pleased
she survived the coma.

957
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,209
Look,
it's not a secret or anything,

958
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:20,739
so why do you need to know?

959
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,310
We're just trying to build a picture.

960
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,360
She were just...

961
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,150
She were just Deena.

962
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,489
Tell me about the incident,

963
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:36,619
when you lost
your booze licence.

964
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,459
That were my fault.

965
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,119
I put her on the bar.

966
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,229
She got overexcited,
couldn't handle it.

967
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:46,080
- How old were the drinkers?
- 17, so not kids, just...

968
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:50,219
She preferred younger people,
not in an odd way.

969
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,029
She just liked their company.
Felt more herself, I think.

970
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:56,940
Get drunk with teenage lads,
go skinny-dipping, whatever.

971
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:02,420
Anyway, one of the mums found out, thought
it were inappropriate, complained.

972
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,250
How did your dad feel about it all?

973
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,050
Honestly?

974
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,550
It were all too much for him.

975
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,180
He tried to kill himself.

976
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,680
He thinks I don't know that.

977
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,980
But I do.

978
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:29,299
It just strikes me as odd
you didn't mention it.

979
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,190
I just find people make
assumptions,

980
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,540
think she's barmy.

981
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,289
You don't think it impacted
on the way she behaved?

982
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,759
Not really.

983
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,579
Is that what the medics think?

984
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:44,350
They only want to see problems,
not how far she's come.

985
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,230
Apart from the driving,
she led a normal life.

986
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,730
She had mates.

987
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,719
She worked. She went on holidays.

988
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,070
She was just a lovely,
sweet, kind person.

989
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:03,059
But wasn't it her behaviour
lost you your licence?

990
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,149
She'd just get carried away,
that's all.

991
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,259
Well, that must have
hurt financially.

992
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,560
No bar?

993
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,330
It wasn't ideal, I'll give you that.

994
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,119
Did you ever use her cards

995
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,499
or ask her to help
you financially?

996
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,059
No, never.

997
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,559
I would never do that.

998
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,390
Her money was her money.

999
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,619
Only there's a couple of recent
transactions on her credit card.

1000
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,249
400 quid, pool supplies.

1001
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:38,899
500 pounds cash and carry.

1002
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,060
- What do you think of that?
- Right.

1003
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:48,100
20 quid, 20 quid.

1004
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,299
30 quid.

1005
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,700
50 quid.

1006
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,159
Her beer
for her mates

1007
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,779
for her sodding pool party.

1008
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,450
Dad, what's going on?

1009
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:01,999
She reckons I've been dipping into
Deena's trust fund for this.

1010
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,739
Are you barking?

1011
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,899
Dad would never touch
her money. Never.

1012
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,350
- Calm down.
- No.

1013
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,729
Is this what you lot do?
Just pick on the relatives?

1014
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,779
He's been asking me all-sorts.

1015
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,089
DS Ashworth's just
doing his job, love.

1016
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:18,209
Well, it doesn't look like it.
He's bereaved!

1017
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:20,979
My life's been completely
blown apart.

1018
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,819
And you lot just swan in
and stamp all over us.

1019
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:25,929
- That's enough, Claire.
- The more you tell us,

1020
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:28,659
- the easier it'll be.
- Well, ask the lawyer.

1021
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,119
She'll tell you.

1022
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,240
He couldn't touch her money,
even if he wanted to.

1023
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:45,019
Somehow, Jim gets wind of
a party at the caravan park.

1024
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,399
Sees Deena's brought
yet more trouble.

1025
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,079
Thinks it's the end anyway,

1026
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,689
so decides to cut his losses,
do her in.

1027
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:54,339
Kills her rather than
himself, you mean?

1028
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,099
Yeah, well, his suicide attempt

1029
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,019
and the business put
on a final warning,

1030
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,169
that does tally time-wise.

1031
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:02,729
Must have been pretty desperate.

1032
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,979
Yeah, well, didn't jump,
though, did he?

1033
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,700
Maybe he thought of another way.

1034
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,999
But how did he get cross country?

1035
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,699
His car doesn't budge
from the hotel car park.

1036
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,619
Have we checked vehicle flow?

1037
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:19,379
Yeah, there's a Megane that
stops on the embankment

1038
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,459
on the dual carriageway
down the hill.

1039
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,930
We're doing resolutions
on the plate, but...

1040
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,060
What about her, the daughter?

1041
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,729
Well, again the hotel says

1042
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:31,939
that she was on the
dance floor till 2×m.

1043
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,349
Yeah, well,
that doesn't mean anything.

1044
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:35,550
She could have had an
accomplice at the scene.

1045
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,929
Let's get on to dad's phone.

1046
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,689
It's just...

1047
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:43,979
Look, I'm sorry.
This is just how it is, love.

1048
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,650
Two steps forward, one step back.

1049
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,939
Find the bullet. Ballistics
match it to the weapon.

1050
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,150
- Fingerprint it and you're sorted.
- Well.

1051
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,490
Who's DS Ashworth?

1052
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:59,290
Joe?

1053
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:03,290
He's...
He's the old you.

1054
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,419
'Ey, I'm sorry.
Did I...

1055
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,050
No, doesn't matter. Where is he now?

1056
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:11,490
Big promotion.

1057
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:16,339
Nice house next to an "outstanding".
Another girl on the way.

1058
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:19,050
Oh, yeah?
I'll stick with you, then.

1059
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:24,510
Let's see what this
solicitor has to say.

1060
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,389
Known the family a while, then?

1061
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:33,629
I drew up the original agreements
when the parents got elderly.

1062
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:36,799
- The money's the money from their house.
- Right.

1063
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,000
We thought it was compensation.

1064
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,589
So, could Deena access
the fund herself

1065
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:44,379
or did it go straight
into her account?

1066
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,680
The latter.

1067
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,659
What if she wanted more?

1068
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:52,859
She could consult with the trustees
but we're a pretty tight-fisted lot.

1069
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:56,379
- Who are the trustees?
- Myself and a couple of family friends.

1070
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:59,710
- And is Jim next of kin -
- Malcolm and Lesley Raggert?

1071
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:03,739
Is that Malcolm Raggert,
who lives at the caravan park?

1072
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,379
I believe it is, yes.

1073
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,980
He moved there full time
after his wife died.

1074
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,670
- And when was that?
- Eight, nine months ago.

1075
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,939
How did she die?

1076
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:19,039
Pneumonia? Septicaemia?
One of the two.

1077
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,349
One of those horrifying
'go into hospital,

1078
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:23,299
six weeks later,
you're dead' things.

1079
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:27,009
And are Jim and Malcolm still
friends, as far as you know?

1080
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:28,419
As far as I know.

1081
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,830
They definitely were
when we drew this up.

1082
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,020
Thanks, love.

1083
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,999
Kenny, tell her.
We picked up Malcolm Raggert

1084
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,759
at work the day of the fire.

1085
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,419
Yep. Uniform found him there.

1086
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,449
The first thing we did
after we secured the scene.

1087
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:47,139
Yeah, but did you check
what time he got there?

1088
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:49,119
No, we brought him in
as a victim of crime.

1089
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,879
Now, after I spoke to Raggert,

1090
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,159
I specifically asked
you to double-check.

1091
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,829
- Did you do that?
- No, I...

1092
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:57,570
I went with you to the family.

1093
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,739
<i>Fiasco.</i>

1094
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,620
Pull up his statement.
Read it back to me.

1095
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,079
"Blaring music.
I remonstrated with partygoers.

1096
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,339
"I was awoken by a
boy in a red jacket

1097
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:12,150
"knocking on my door.
Left for work around 4:30."

1098
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,720
And what time did Riley
say he was there, hm?

1099
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,820
After six.

1100
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
Find me Raggert.

1101
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,360
Right, find him.

1102
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,600
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1103
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,259
You know I just want
to check a little

1104
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,679
discrepancy on your statement.

1105
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:32,750
You told us you left for an
early delivery round at 4:30.

1106
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,639
Only we've a witness reckons

1107
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,049
he saw you at the
park nearer six.

1108
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:39,359
What witness?

1109
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,269
That young lad you
picked out for us.

1110
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:43,469
The one you said you spoke to.

1111
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:46,909
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm so... I'm sorry.

1112
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:49,679
I was confused.
Yeah...

1113
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,659
Nearer six is probably
more likely, yeah.

1114
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,390
Just borrowed this from your van.

1115
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,420
Look at that.

1116
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,009
Well, look at that.

1117
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:06,350
It says here you clocked
in to the depot at 7:50.

1118
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,929
So, would that tally with
what you're telling me now?

1119
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:12,299
That you left
for work later

1120
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,609
than what you said
in your statement.

1121
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:15,919
Yeah.

1122
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,510
Well, like I said, you know,

1123
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,829
nearer six is
probably more likely.

1124
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,800
Yeah, well, that's that.

1125
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,750
So, why do you think you made
a mistake in your statement?

1126
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,450
I were thrown.

1127
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,750
You know, given the
circumstances and everything.

1128
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:47,039
Ma'am.
Malcolm clear it up for you?

1129
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,399
Yes. Lying through
his teeth, of course.

1130
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,439
He's coming in to go
through his statement.

1131
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,319
Right. This is...
Jim's mobile.

1132
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,559
He gets five messages
on Malcolm's number

1133
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,219
between midnight and 4×m.

1134
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,879
None of them answered.

1135
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,999
Also, he's not been paying his rent.

1136
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,829
Been living here free for
the last eight months.

1137
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:09,799
Eight months? It's all hanging
round this eight months, isn't it?

1138
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,719
Deena goes and loses their licence.

1139
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,900
Jim goes to the edge.

1140
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,599
Mr. Viner?

1141
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:22,739
Sorry.
It's just we understand

1142
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,759
Mr. Raggert made several calls to you.

1143
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,759
I know, about the noise.

1144
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,510
My phone was off.

1145
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,659
If I'd have picked it up,
I'd have come running.

1146
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,770
Hm. Why was your phone off?

1147
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,080
I needed a break.

1148
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,959
Why do you waive
Mr. Raggert's rent?

1149
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,750
He was struggling.

1150
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,170
He wasn't really able to function.

1151
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,060
You know, after his wife died.

1152
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:53,320
He had to take a delivery job.

1153
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,560
Do you expect anything in return?

1154
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,840
- No. No, I don't.
- No?

1155
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,890
- Are you sure?
- What's this in aid of?

1156
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,299
You don't think Malcolm
did it, do you?

1157
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,600
No.

1158
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,719
No,
he's not a suspect at the moment.

1159
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,159
He told me he was at work.

1160
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,210
Do you think he should be a suspect?

1161
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,340
I don't know.

1162
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,899
- I couldn't say.
- How close are you?

1163
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,310
He gets tetchy with me
occasionally, but...

1164
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,400
we're mates.

1165
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,879
What's my finances got
to do with anything?

1166
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,689
Well, I'm just trying to establish

1167
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:50,729
if you felt indebted
to him in any way.

1168
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:52,039
I don't.

1169
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:55,139
No? Well, he supported
you when your wife died.

1170
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:56,909
You were a trustee for his sister.

1171
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:58,219
- So?
-- So,

1172
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,239
did the pair of you hatch a plot

1173
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,240
to get the park
out of trouble?

1174
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:05,899
You do his dirty
work while he was away.

1175
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,399
That's ridiculous.
Absolutely not.

1176
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,819
Help out your oldest mate
in his hour of need.

1177
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,229
No, no way. Look, I don't
even like the fella.

1178
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:16,280
Honest to God, he's the last person
I'd help out with anything.

1179
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,869
That supposed to make me
less suspicious, is it?

1180
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:22,839
Only he told me you
were on good terms.

1181
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,909
So what's he done to
get your back up, hm?

1182
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:27,799
Parties.

1183
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,800
Raving lunatics, thugs.

1184
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:34,139
People copping off
in the pool, drugs.

1185
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,930
You know there were drugs there, don't
you? I mean, it ruined everything.

1186
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,359
Right, keeping it simple, Malcolm's
in a rage about the noise.

1187
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,059
Deena's the ringleader.

1188
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:45,369
He can't sleep.

1189
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:49,359
He gets woken up by Riley,
loses his rag and boom, torchio.

1190
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,319
Let's just see what they
say rather than us guess.

1191
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,039
You do it yourself, you know.

1192
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,710
Yeah, well,
that is entirely different.

1193
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,360
Mr. Synnott?

1194
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,299
Could we have a word, love?

1195
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:25,639
We've just got a couple more questions
about Saturday night at the bonfire.

1196
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,729
Where were you when Malcolm came out?

1197
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:29,939
I was just having a
chill-out by the fire.

1198
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:32,330
I was talking to Sal.
And...

1199
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,719
Malcolm just starts freaking out.

1200
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,889
Starts saying he's
gonna ring you lot.

1201
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:39,199
Yeah, go on.

1202
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,219
Well, Deena comes back from the pool.

1203
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,589
We tell her he's threatening
to call the cops.

1204
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:47,369
And then she starts kicking off
about Ryan cheating on Claire.

1205
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:50,549
It wasn't like that. He's got
the wrong end of the stick.

1206
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:53,489
For crying out loud, Ry!
Somebody's died.

1207
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:55,889
Yeah, I know.
She wasn't having a go at me.

1208
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:57,719
She was just arsed at Malcolm.

1209
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,679
He'd... been a bit of a killjoy.

1210
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,949
That's wishful thinking,
mate.

1211
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:05,059
She was banging on about
people playing around,

1212
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:07,060
said she wanted to
have it out with him.

1213
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,760
Thanks.

1214
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,559
Right, let's push Raggert on whether
or not he talked to Deena.

1215
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,739
Er, this is Jade, the PCSO who was
on patrol at Parkinthorpe Cliffs.

1216
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:23,699
Jim Viner, the talking-to.

1217
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,949
Just tell the DCI what you told me.

1218
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:27,689
Are you sure it was the same man,
love?

1219
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:29,679
It was a while back,
eight months.

1220
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,089
I remember it cos I was on my own.

1221
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:34,149
It's only my second jumper.

1222
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:37,379
- Did he say he was going to jump?
- He did seem very down.

1223
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:40,089
He told me his wife had
just died suddenly.

1224
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:42,719
No, not his wife,
his partner.

1225
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,859
Did he say her name?

1226
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:46,409
No.

1227
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:48,069
Just that she was
the love of his life

1228
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:50,069
and he wanted
to be with her.

1229
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:54,130
Did he happen to mention
how she died, love?

1230
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,850
- Was it pneumonia?
- That's it, pneumonia.

1231
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,780
That's good.
That's very good.

1232
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,430
So you were having an affair
with Lesley Raggert.

1233
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,260
I thought no-one knew.

1234
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:23,539
It's not something I want
people to know about.

1235
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:27,670
Big thing to keep to yourself,
though, isn't it?

1236
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,590
I mean, not letting on,
even after she died.

1237
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,959
Nearly took you over
the edge, didn't it?

1238
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,479
It was the keeping up appearances.

1239
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,550
I couldn't handle it.

1240
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,120
I'd lost...

1241
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:46,250
Well, she was like a second
wife, in some ways.

1242
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:52,050
And you just kept it between
the two of you. Is that right?

1243
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,389
We both had other people
who needed us.

1244
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:59,059
We thought...

1245
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:01,150
you know, maybe in
the future, sometime.

1246
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,919
But it turned out there wasn't one.

1247
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,499
Do you think Malcolm knew?

1248
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,059
Well, Deena thought he did.

1249
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,690
Yeah,
but what do you think?

1250
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,920
Well, he asked me to read
at Lesley's funeral,

1251
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:18,190
thanked me for being
such a good friend.

1252
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,730
He'd have had to have been off
his rocker to do that if he knew.

1253
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:27,210
I think Deena might have told
him the night of the fire.

1254
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,039
Right.

1255
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,170
Do you think that's possible?

1256
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,420
I suppose.

1257
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,180
I suppose it's all my fault,
then, really, isn't it?

1258
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:48,030
- I can't recall anything.
- Can't you?

1259
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,269
Only we've a witness

1260
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:53,079
saying she kicked off after
you called the police,

1261
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,219
wanted to have it out.
So,

1262
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:57,679
did Deena come and talk to you?

1263
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,509
- Maybe briefly.
- And said what?

1264
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:03,569
- I didn't listen. She was drunk.
- Oh, you remember that.

1265
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:06,559
Did she tell you your wife
had been cheating on you

1266
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,920
with your old mate Jim?

1267
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:13,979
- She repeated a rumour, yeah.
- A rumour.

1268
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,959
It was something
people had said before

1269
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,369
but I don't think it was true.

1270
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:20,259
Yeah, well, even so, how did
you feel when she said it?

1271
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:21,950
Upset, obviously.

1272
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,490
We were all friends.

1273
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:28,809
It's not nice when people
cast aspersions.

1274
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:30,679
You told me before
you didn't like him.

1275
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,950
That was because he let things slide.

1276
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,259
That caravan park was our sanctuary.

1277
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:39,730
When Lesley got ill, that
was where she wanted to be.

1278
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,219
- Anything on Raggert's van?
- Just started on it.

1279
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,659
- What's that in the corner?
- What, that?

1280
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:00,960
Yeah.

1281
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:03,760
Is it petrol?

1282
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:06,900
Yes, it is.

1283
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,210
- But it's empty.
- I want prints ASAP.

1284
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,490
Right, then, Mr. Raggert...

1285
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,139
If we find this was used
to start the fire...

1286
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:25,139
And we will find out.
We can match it.

1287
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,179
.. it'll be much,
and I mean much, better for you

1288
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:30,109
if you come clean.

1289
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:32,099
I didn't know Deena
had moved down there.

1290
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,279
She was there two days.
You didn't notice?

1291
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,039
Not gonna torch my own stuff, am I?

1292
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,979
You might,
if you felt deceived,

1293
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:40,119
if something
precious was ruined.

1294
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,779
I wasn't deceived.
I didn't want to live

1295
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:43,389
next-door to a drug den.

1296
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:45,699
So is this you admitting
to starting the fire?

1297
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:47,139
I didn't say that.

1298
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:49,609
It was by the kids'
playground, for God's sake.

1299
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:52,330
So you were being community-minded?
Very nice.

1300
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,500
So, why not complain
to your old mate Jim?

1301
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,569
Well, if he wasn't gonna
fix my hot water,

1302
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:03,300
he was hardly gonna deal
with drug dealers, was he?

1303
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,869
I'm sorry, love. I don't believe you.

1304
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:10,219
You see, I think you were
rattled by the rumour

1305
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:13,759
and you started the fire to
stop the rumour spreading.

1306
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,539
Get back at your old mate
and silence Deena for good.

1307
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:18,840
All right!

1308
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,070
Maybe I did start the fire.

1309
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,990
I didn't know anyone was in there.

1310
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,009
Somebody had to act.

1311
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:34,199
I wanted to get rid of
the drugs, not kill Deena.

1312
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,500
OK.

1313
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,640
So how, hm?

1314
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:45,999
- How did you kill her?
- Is that a trick question?

1315
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,449
No, no.
How did she die?

1316
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:50,150
I don't understand.

1317
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,280
I told you, I started the fire.

1318
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,409
I just...
I went mad for a moment.

1319
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:59,560
The noise, the disrespect.

1320
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,450
It just sent me over the edge.

1321
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,940
Update, ASAP.

1322
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,479
Look, here.

1323
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,569
He's just admitted
to killing her,

1324
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:15,049
for the sake of
the caravan park.

1325
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,639
Fantastic.

1326
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:21,300
The only thing is, he's insisting
it was the fire that did it.

1327
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:27,219
They can't link him to
the key. They've tried.

1328
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:29,830
They Quasared all round the cabinet
again but still nothing.

1329
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,119
The Megane that stopped for about
30 seconds on the A road,

1330
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,979
it was too dark to see
if a passenger got out,

1331
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:36,759
but we've finally
tracked it backwards.

1332
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:39,970
It came from Netherfield
Hall, about 4×m.

1333
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:41,960
Jimbo.

1334
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:47,860
That's Claire's car.

1335
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:56,289
- Are you all right, love?
- No. It's my dad.

1336
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:58,190
I can't get hold of him.

1337
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,800
Look.

1338
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:02,719
"Sorry"

1339
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,910
I'm scared he's going
to kill himself.

1340
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:15,599
Right, and ANPR.
I want him found.

1341
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,429
He's tried it before.

1342
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,919
Yeah, thanks, Kenny. No, it's
all right, love. We'll find him.

1343
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:25,159
Now, just think. Is there anywhere
else he might have gone?

1344
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:28,290
- I don't know.
- Well, have a little think.

1345
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:32,049
Ma'am,
major incident at Abbey Point.

1346
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:33,690
Fella's got himself up on the wall.

1347
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,789
Dad!

1348
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,959
Let me go!
Get off!

1349
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,630
- Hey, boss!
- Come on.

1350
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,050
Mr. Viner.

1351
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:55,699
Jim, love, come on down.
There's no need for this.

1352
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:59,699
Come on, love. Come on.
There's no need for this.

1353
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:02,980
Hey, boss!
Vera, get back!

1354
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:05,470
No, Vera!

1355
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,459
We can sort this out.

1356
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,060
- I'm sorry.
- No, come on, love.

1357
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,990
Look, we can sort anything out.

1358
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:21,190
My dad used to come up here.

1359
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,300
Nick the birds' eggs.

1360
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:29,550
There's protected species
nesting here.

1361
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:32,539
Dad, please!

1362
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:34,419
You hear that? That's your daughter.

1363
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:37,170
If you do this, she's going
to see everything and...

1364
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:40,120
she doesn't deserve that, love.

1365
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,159
Lesley wouldn't want that.

1366
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,920
- Dad!
- Now, come on, love.

1367
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,420
Hey, boss.
Boss!

1368
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,519
Here, help me out here,
love, will you?

1369
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,200
Give us a hand.

1370
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:02,350
That's it, love.

1371
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,990
Now, you come with me, love.

1372
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,590
Come on, Jim.
That's it.

1373
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,950
- That's it, love.
- Give us your hand.

1374
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,559
Come on.
That's it.

1375
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:13,960
Steady.

1376
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,330
That's it.
Ma'am.

1377
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,020
Come on.

1378
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:39,180
And I thought my old
lot were macho idiots.

1379
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,200
We'll interview him first
thing in the morning.

1380
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,379
And get him a psych evaluation.

1381
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,619
Get someone a psych evaluation.

1382
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,150
I heard that.

1383
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,319
They've tracked the Megane
to an address in Jesmond.

1384
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,429
- Kenny's heading there now.
- Right, good.

1385
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:11,409
And where's Marcus on cause of death?

1386
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:14,750
He's struggling. Says it might be
impossible, state the body's in.

1387
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:20,909
Did the fire department put out the bonfire
or was it the stags themselves?

1388
01:18:20,910 --> 01:18:22,219
It's Bethany.

1389
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:25,479
Wants to know if we're charging Malcolm
with murder or manslaughter.

1390
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:28,649
Murder! You don't set
fire to a caravan park

1391
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:30,389
full of gas canisters and people

1392
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:33,060
and then get surprised
when someone gets hurt.

1393
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:38,279
Those LPG heaters
weren't sound, were they?

1394
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,210
- Hadn't had the upgrade.
- No.

1395
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:41,910
Why?

1396
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,200
Hot water.

1397
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,910
Malcolm complained about hot water.

1398
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,799
Now, Forensics bagged
up that rubbish.

1399
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,109
- Right?
- Yeah.

1400
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:56,160
- All the empties?
- It's at the lab.

1401
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:04,280
lan.

1402
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,310
- What are we looking for?
- This.

1403
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:14,699
Look.
"Netherfield Hotel".

1404
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,559
Can I have the prints on this,
love?

1405
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,860
Front of the queue.-

1406
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:29,520
Where's Ryan?

1407
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:31,160
Upstairs.

1408
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,100
Ryan, love.

1409
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,230
Just want to ask you a couple
of questions about your stag do.

1410
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,140
Now, how much had you drunk?

1411
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,299
- A lot.
- A lot of champagne?

1412
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:57,039
- No.
- I think you had champagne.

1413
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,889
No, we didn't. We didn't
have any bubbly.

1414
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:04,399
- Did the girls have champagne?
- No, not that I'm aware of.

1415
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,009
Did you see a bottle, though?

1416
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:08,430
It's hard to say.
I mean, I was...

1417
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,020
That's all right, love.

1418
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,500
I don't think you did have champagne.

1419
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:18,129
But you told my DC here

1420
01:20:18,130 --> 01:20:20,450
that you'd been careful.

1421
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:24,459
But why had you been careful?

1422
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:28,389
Well, I knew the
electrics were dicey.

1423
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:31,380
The heaters, the whole thing,
it were just...

1424
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:33,299
It was a bad idea.

1425
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,749
How do you mean, exactly,
with the heaters?

1426
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:37,140
They could leak gas.

1427
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:40,059
Used to get a headache
when I went in there.

1428
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:42,840
Did you share that information
with anyone, love?

1429
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:45,280
Yeah.

1430
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:48,489
The blood results.

1431
01:20:48,490 --> 01:20:51,039
Carboxyhaemoglobin.

1432
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,109
Now,
could that be from exposure

1433
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:56,049
to a lower level
of carbon monoxide

1434
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,599
over a longer period,

1435
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,999
rather than a quick
fix from the bonfire?

1436
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,389
Could be, but she'd
have known about it.

1437
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:06,580
She would have had headaches
and flu-like symptoms...

1438
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:12,429
<i>Hence the paracetamol.
Has someone fessed up, then?</i>

1439
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:14,069
Not yet, Marcus.

1440
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:15,640
Not yet.

1441
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,900
Mr. Raggert.

1442
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:30,479
When Jim didn't return your
calls, what did you do?

1443
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:33,599
- Called Claire.
- Did you speak to her?

1444
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,399
Left a message.

1445
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,069
Told her Ryan was on the loose
with a lot of half-naked girls.

1446
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:40,850
Fat lot of good that did.

1447
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:44,160
None of them give a damn
about my suffering.

1448
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,900
Thanks.

1449
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:03,069
- Kenny.
- The Megane driver

1450
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:05,429
was a guest
<i>at a wedding in Netherfield.</i>

1451
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:07,999
<i>She saw Claire trying
to drink-drive.</i>

1452
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,299
<i>Yeah, she offered her a lift
home and dropped her on the A road.</i>

1453
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,600
Thanks, Ken.

1454
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:23,220
Netherfield Hotel.

1455
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,300
Must have brought it back with me.

1456
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:30,299
Only we sent this for
forensic examination

1457
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:32,459
before you arrived
back on the Sunday.

1458
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:35,150
So...
how did it get there?

1459
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:40,349
I think you came back
earlier that morning

1460
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:42,229
because you heard
Ryan was there.

1461
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:44,679
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

1462
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:48,169
But there was no-one there, so
I just tidied up and I left.

1463
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:50,899
Did you see Deena?
Or talk to her?

1464
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,209
No.

1465
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:55,750
- She were asleep in her chalet.
- Why not tell us that?

1466
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,909
Was that because you'd locked her in?

1467
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:02,930
Only we've got your DNA on the key.

1468
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,999
I use that key all the time.

1469
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,699
- Did you lock her in?
- Yes.

1470
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,479
- Louder, please.
- Yes!

1471
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,459
But just because I were worried

1472
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:19,310
that she were off her face.
I thought she would hurt herself.

1473
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:24,199
Is it my fault she didn't escape?

1474
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,980
Oh, she was dead before
the fire started, love.

1475
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,610
Carbon monoxide.

1476
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,299
- Water heaters.
- That's awful.

1477
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,450
Poor Deena.

1478
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,340
If I'd have known, I'd have...

1479
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,109
Please don't tell my dad.

1480
01:23:46,110 --> 01:23:47,699
He'll blame himself.

1481
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:51,059
Well, ultimately,
he'll blame you, love,

1482
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:54,620
because we know Ryan warned
you of the danger.

1483
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,970
I forgot.

1484
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,450
You were drunk,

1485
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,279
your fiance cavorting
behind your back.

1486
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:08,179
Yet again Deena scuppers
it all for you.

1487
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:10,119
One weekend away

1488
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:14,629
and there's police and drugs,
sex in the pool.

1489
01:24:14,630 --> 01:24:17,519
You thought it was
game over, didn't you?

1490
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,239
Well, yeah.

1491
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,030
But it's a business.

1492
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:24,409
I care but I wouldn't
kill someone over it.

1493
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:27,139
No, I meant game over for your dad.

1494
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:29,700
You thought it would
push him over the edge.

1495
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:34,039
You thought it was a close
thing last time, didn't you?

1496
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,649
When she lost him his licence.

1497
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:38,480
Well, that's what you
told my sergeant here.

1498
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:42,239
I didn't switch anything
on in the cabin.

1499
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:44,900
Did you warn her of the danger?

1500
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,540
No.

1501
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:51,659
Did you wake her up while she
was sleeping in the chalet?

1502
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:55,809
Did you do anything at all to help
her get out, even though you knew?

1503
01:24:55,810 --> 01:24:58,590
See, you could have saved her life.

1504
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,760
Did you choose to do so?

1505
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,710
I didn't.

1506
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:07,940
No.

1507
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:12,350
Was her behaviour so
bad she deserved to die?

1508
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,350
It wasn't a punishment.

1509
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,110
I did it to help my dad.

1510
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,209
Years he'd felt responsible for her.

1511
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:24,479
Years she'd played up.

1512
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:28,229
When I saw how they'd trashed
the place, I'd just had enough.

1513
01:25:28,230 --> 01:25:31,499
The ingratitude, after all
he'd done to put her first.

1514
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,169
Always put you second.

1515
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,550
No, not just me.

1516
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:37,749
My mum, when she were alive.

1517
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:40,200
Deena's always been a burden.

1518
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,620
Anyway...

1519
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,500
I don't think she'd have suffered.

1520
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:50,539
- It's painless, isn't it?
- Not really.

1521
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:53,350
It causes seizures in the brain.
It would have been painful.

1522
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,500
I were just scared for my dad.

1523
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:01,390
Anyway, you got it all wrong, love.

1524
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:06,790
Deena's behaviour... Oh, your
dad could cope with that.

1525
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:10,820
No, that's not why he tried to
kill himself eight months ago.

1526
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:15,030
No, he was having a relationship
with Lesley Raggert.

1527
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:16,860
Years.

1528
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:21,889
It was her dying that
pushed him to the brink.

1529
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:25,579
You killed your Auntie
Deena for nothing, pet.

1530
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:26,880
No.

1531
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,620
My God.

1532
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,200
My God.

1533
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:32,080
Come on.

1534
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,150
Cornettos are on me.

1535
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,440
Here you are, love.

1536
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:41,759
Aiden, you...

1537
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:46,189
And we should notify someone
about that lie on her CV.

1538
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:49,059
- I've already emailed them.
- Well done.

1539
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:52,549
Not sure I want her looking
after me in my dotage.

1540
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:56,079
I'm not sure she'd want to
look after you in your dotage.

1541
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,680
Joke.

1542
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,050
I'm sorry.

1543
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:09,910
For mucking us about with Malcolm.
It won't happen again.

1544
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,850
Better not.

1545
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,629
Get over yourself.

1546
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:22,219
You're new. It's normal to
wade in with your size nines.

1547
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:24,919
- They've all done it.
- What, your DSes?

1548
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,620
All bar none.

1549
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,090
Anyway, you was having a bit of a tough
time before you came to us, so...

1550
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,950
I'll give you the benefit
of the doubt.

1551
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,829
Are you going to have to
go and explain yourself?

1552
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:41,219
You know, official walk off a cliff?

1553
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:44,580
I expect there'll be some
sort of refresher course.

1554
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:47,930
I'll just send you.

1555

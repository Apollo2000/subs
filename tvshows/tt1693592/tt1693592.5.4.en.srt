00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,639
Hey, come on, pet.
Let's get you home.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
Come on.

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,239
Lila, it's out of order.

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,329
I'll go up top.
I'll only be a minute.

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,630
OK.

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,279
Hi, this is Owen's phone.

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,500
<i>Sorry I can't take your call
at the moment.</i>

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,500
Dad?

10
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,540
Dad...

14
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,799
Er, excuse me,
back in your car, madam.

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,490
- The road's closed.
- Land Rover.

16
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,209
Empty one.

17
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,599
Find a space,
then find me.

18
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,120
No... Excuse me.

19
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,959
- Ma'am.
- Please.

20
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,669
- Can I get through?
- No, I'm sorry.

21
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,979
Please,
I'll be two minutes.

22
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,719
Sorry, you can't.
It's a crime scene area.

23
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,359
Well, how long do I have to wait?

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,660
Hello, George.

25
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,900
Evening, ma'am.

26
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,950
Nice and calm.
Well done.

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,200
Tell that to the folk who are
backed up on the ring road.

28
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,990
He could have waited
till Sunday morning.

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,559
Anyone see him come down?

30
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,199
No-one that's come forward.

31
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,320
That couple there, they were
two storeys up, driving round.

32
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,170
Other than that, nothing.

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,900
Right.

34
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,039
- Is that the daughter?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,959
Was her prom night.

36
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,800
Thankfully, she didn't
see it. He went up top.

37
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,930
Ma'am, this is Lila.

38
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,479
Lila, this is DCI Stanhope.

39
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,449
Hello, love. I'm sorry.

40
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,880
Is it your dad...
who fell?

41
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,870
Right, now, listen to me, love.

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,170
We're going to get someone
to come and pick you up

43
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,679
but it'll be really
helpful if you could tell

44
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,199
my officer here
everything that happened.

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Can you do that?

46
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,679
How did he fall?

47
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,080
Well, that's what I'm
going to find out.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,120
Was he up there on his own?

49
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,479
I don't know.

50
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,360
I was in the car.

51
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,719
- They won't leave him there, will they?
- No, love.

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,199
There's some special officers
on their way here

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,870
and they're going to
be taking your dad away.

54
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,780
- It's my daughter!
- My mum.

55
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,800
- Go on, then.
- All right.

56
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,479
- What's happened?
- I didn't see it.

57
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,139
- Where's your dad?
- We went for chips.

58
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,440
- Where's your dad, luv?
- Mrs. Thorne, love.

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,710
You can't go through.

60
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,520
Right, here we go.

61
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,599
He's face up at least.

62
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,500
Check his pockets, Kenny.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Parking ticket.

64
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,719
Smashed.

65
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,080
- See if you can get that fixed.
- Will do.

66
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,790
Awkward place to pick.

67
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,040
If he did pick it.

68
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,049
So what's with the limp?

69
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,759
I was playing five-a-side.

70
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,690
Dirty players, those firemen.

71
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,540
Well, that's where he paid.

72
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,839
Now this suggests he
didn't jump, doesn't it?

73
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,599
How does it suggest that?

74
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,960
Well, why would you pay for parking?

75
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,079
And why has he come
all the way over here?

76
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,550
Please don't do that!

77
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,109
Right,
make this the primary scene.

78
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,719
But get them to sweep the whole area.

79
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,119
And get them to check the outside.

80
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,919
In case he clung on.

81
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,490
Could it have been an accident?

82
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,820
Don't know.

83
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,509
Why,
what are you thinking?

84
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,479
Maybe he was trying to escape from
something coming towards him,

85
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,180
might chance it on the flyover.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,300
Maybe...

87
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,279
He's landed head first.

88
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,759
That suggests he didn't just
climb over and step off.

89
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,010
- So, pushed?
- Don't know.

90
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,050
But from the way he landed,
I'd say he went off backwards.

91
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,879
Look at that.

92
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,750
What's he seen?
Kenny, go back.

93
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,039
Here, watch. Now,
he's seen something.

94
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,959
And it's not someone asking
for change, is it?

95
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,579
Are we sure it's not the daughter?

96
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,399
No. She said she was in the
car on the floor below.

97
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,839
Are there any other cameras
covering this area?

98
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,359
No. They only coverage is on the
entry barrier and payment machines.

99
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,059
You've ruled out everyone
else in the vicinity?

100
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,149
- Yes, we have.
- So if someone came on foot,

101
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,599
like up the stairs,

102
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,699
they wouldn't necessarily
be seen on here?

103
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,439
Not necessarily, no.

104
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,649
So how long was this
before he falls?

105
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,099
About five minutes.

106
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,159
According to one of the drivers,
said he landed on the car.

107
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,410
So, he sees something,
he hurries towards it,

108
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,899
something happens
and over he goes.

109
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,450
Got to be linked.

110
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,159
Get uniform asking questions,

111
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,910
and I want a trace on every
car coming in and going out.

112
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,080
We've missed someone.

113
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,909
What's that?

114
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,599
Windscreen wiper. Severed an artery.

115
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,439
Might have killed him if
he hadn't landed head first.

116
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,639
Does head first suggest pushed?

117
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,199
Not necessarily.

118
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,479
It suggests he didn't step off.

119
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,829
But... He could've dived.

120
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,079
I've seen that before. Like
they're going into water.

121
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,680
No, he'd have hit the flyover.

122
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,159
Were there any signs
of an altercation?

123
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,240
No, no defensive injuries.

124
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,390
So if he was pushed,

125
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,639
it wasn't off
the back of a fight.

126
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,999
No.

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,039
And there were no other injuries
sustained tonight.

128
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
However, there are these.

129
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,799
How long have they been there?

130
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,159
Within the last month.

131
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,079
What does that suggest? That shape.

132
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,159
That he fell backwards
onto something solid.

133
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,019
Or was pushed backwards
onto something solid?

134
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,010
"Made contact with".

135
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,419
That's as certain
as I can be for now.

136
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,859
He'd been drinking. Couple
of glasses of red tonight

137
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,359
but I'd say more than
that on a regular basis.

138
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,319
What, problem drinker
or just your average?

139
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,399
Depends on your
definition of average.

140
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,359
He was definitely over
the limit to drive.

141
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,000
But went out anyway.

142
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
But that tells us something.

143
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,900
Don't know what...

144
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,959
- Hi.
- DCI Vera Stanhope.

145
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,659
You're...
Cameron, is that right?

146
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,459
- Yeah. Do you need me?
- Is your mam in?

147
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,759
She's just gone to bed. Could
you come back in a bit?

148
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,050
Yeah, well, we would, love.
It's just...

149
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,820
It's best if it's still
fresh in the mind.

150
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,600
Why did your dad pick you
up early from the prom?

151
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,359
I didn't get the message
till after my class.

152
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,119
Her form teacher rang.

153
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,820
Owen picked it up first.

154
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,060
Why did your teacher ring?

155
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,220
Just some girls in my class.

156
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,159
- You know, saying stuff.
- It's just comments.

157
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,930
We've been dealing with it.

158
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,249
Hey, you've done so well.

159
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,000
Did you see anyone else around?

160
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,290
I didn't see anything.

161
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,790
What did you get
up to last night?

162
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,040
I was round my mate Greg's.

163
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,350
Yeah, I came back just ahead
of my mum and the police.

164
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,450
I'll give you his number.

165
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,390
Would your dad normally
stay in on a Saturday?

166
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,060
Yeah.

167
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,220
Sometimes he went down the Ship,
but not that much recently.

168
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,580
He was trying not to drink.

169
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,230
Had he made plans for the weekend?

170
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,719
There was talk of bowling today.

171
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,699
And on Mondays he goes down
to the beach and cleans up.

172
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,199
Some eco project thing.

173
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,319
No signs of depression or...
previous attempts?

174
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,660
No, nothing.

175
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,460
Nothing like that.

176
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,100
He just wouldn't of.

177
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,659
He weren't the type.

178
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,470
Did you get a sense he was under
stress at all, at work maybe?

179
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,450
Management were on his back
for a while, I know that.

180
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,719
But he said it'd blown over.

181
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,039
What did he do?

182
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,960
- Worked at the docks, didn't he?
- Yeah.

183
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,800
What about longer-term plans?

184
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,900
Well, there's Lila, obviously,
and they were adopting her.

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,560
Right, how long has she
been with your mum and dad?

186
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,380
Three years.

187
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,160
Will that still happen, the adoption?

188
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,960
- This won't delay it, will it?
- I don't know.

189
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,750
I can't think that it would.

190
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,050
I feel like I should be doing
something, but I don't know what.

191
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,039
We found some bruising
on your husband's body.

192
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,810
Do you know what that might be from?

193
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,700
Yeah.

194
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,190
He fell over, coming out of the Ship,
the pub, about three week ago.

195
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,870
Not like drunk, just like accidental.

196
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,370
I think that's what he said.

197
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,440
We might also have to look
at the possibility...

198
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,350
.. that someone else was involved
in your husband's death.

199
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,500
What, like some random
person just knocked him?

200
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,119
- Like who?
- Had he fallen out with anyone?

201
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,420
No.

202
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,880
Not that I know of.

203
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,959
Did Helen speak to
anyone from the docks?

204
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,239
Yeah. They're having
a do in his honour.

205
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,180
Right, so was well liked.

206
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,790
Also, Lila.
She's fostered.

207
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,820
- Is she?
- They're going to adopt her.

208
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,490
Right, so can we dig with
the family services?

209
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,500
Right, get Helen onto that an' all.

210
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,059
So not apparently suicidal,

211
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,959
no known disputes.

212
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,119
Where are we on the CCTV trawl?

213
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,159
Still trawling the CCTV.

214
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,519
Is that his phone records?

215
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,279
Not yet, but we had a print
match come up from the body.

216
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,199
Community picked up
a bloke after a fight

217
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,599
on Bloomfield Street
about three weeks back.

218
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,299
So, could that be the
bruising on his back?

219
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,500
Could be. Except this bloke was
calling himself Owen Pearson.

220
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,200
This is Owen Thorne, right?

221
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,240
Yeah, it is.

222
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,569
- Anything on the other fella in the ruck?
- No.

223
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,079
So he's lied to the
police about his ID.

224
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,439
Why would he do that?

225
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,549
He told the police the
fight was his fault.

226
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,559
"Was just a bar room debate.
Got out of hand."

227
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,759
So he drinks, he fights, he
lies to his wife about it.

228
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,309
Now, that's not exactly the picture

229
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,360
we're getting from home, is it?

230
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,780
Ma'am.

231
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,220
- Where was the fight?
- Just on the corner there.

232
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,950
I think you should come in.
It's a good turnout.

233
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,859
Popular, then.

234
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,020
Company's put some
money behind the bar.

235
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,209
Hi. What can I get you?

236
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,510
Don't tempt me, love.

237
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,950
No, we're investigating
the death of Owen Thorne.

238
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,359
- Right.
- Did you know him?

239
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,649
Yeah. He's been coming
in here for years.

240
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,370
When was he last in?

241
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,619
He hasn't been in for a while.

242
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,159
What, not since the fight out front?

243
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,930
Don't know about a fight.

244
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,750
Ask them.

245
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,729
I know no-one wants to speak ill

246
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,850
but, come on, lads,
a man's died.

247
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,300
- That's why we've turned up.
- Not for the free bar?

248
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,799
All right, let's start
with the scrap outside.

249
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,100
Anyone see it?

250
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,720
You might save us getting the wrong
end of the stick, that's all.

251
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,359
Did he do something
we should know about?

252
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,250
No, the opposite.

253
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,650
His mind wasn't on the job...

254
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,150
and there was an accident.

255
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,670
March back.

256
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,550
He didn't check the safety
equipment and a lad died.

257
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,070
- And you think...?
- Blood on his hands,

258
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,550
to call a spade a spade.

259
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,679
Anyone else feel like this?

260
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,279
Not anyone.

261
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,580
Everyone.

262
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,699
Owen Thorne fell to his death

263
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,769
from the top of Eastgate car park.

264
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,339
Now, there's some
indication he encountered

265
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,019
an as yet unidentified
person or persons

266
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,619
shortly before his death.

267
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,889
Now, the trajectory of his fall

268
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,979
suggests he fell backwards.

269
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,789
But his injuries
are not conclusive

270
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,149
with him having been pushed.
But until we know otherwise,

271
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,219
we're treating his
death as suspicious.

272
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,519
Now, have we got a less grisly photo?

273
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,459
Something that gives
a sense of the man...

274
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,019
Selfie from the daughter.

275
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,009
Taken and posted
on social media

276
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,090
about 20 minutes
before death.

277
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,439
Well, he looks happy
enough, doesn't he?

278
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,740
They both do.

279
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,229
Now, the family seem to
think everything was fine.

280
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,129
But preliminary inquiries

281
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,249
suggest his colleagues
blamed him

282
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,969
for a fatal accident at work.

283
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,289
Young lad called Tom
McKittrick, killed in March.

284
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,419
Helen, did you get on
to the docks management?

285
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,909
Yeah, they're saying
we need to speak to HSE.

286
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,899
- I get the impression they're...
- Stonewalling.

287
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,259
- Yep.
- Right, let's get down there.

288
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,599
Get a bit awkward, see if we
can talk to the lad's family.

289
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,259
So is that our line of enquiry?
Linked to this lad's death?

290
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,159
Till we've got something better.

291
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,299
Argument over a parking space.

292
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,609
That'll be it.

293
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,579
Very emotive, parking.

294
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,789
Now, where are we on his phone?

295
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,229
They got the SIM out.
We're waiting for the provider.

296
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,019
Right.
Hey, where are you going?

297
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,819
You stay here. Get
that leg up, Hopalong.

298
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,219
Kenny, you're with me.

299
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,729
Family services want to know

300
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,139
if we judge the home to be "a
suitable environment" for Lila?

301
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,659
Suitable, how?

302
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,319
I think what they're
driving at is,

303
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,150
are the family under suspicion?

304
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,289
Are they?
What about the son, Cameron?

305
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,459
Have we verified he
was with his mate?

306
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,179
Uniform are there as we speak.

307
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,619
- Is he adopted?
- Yeah. And they've also fostered quite a few.

308
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,779
That's why they're asking
us before piling in.

309
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,559
Right, and what about Mam?
Where was she on the night?

310
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,379
Hattington Leisure Centre.

311
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,379
Dance instructor's coming
in to give a statement.

312
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,229
Right. So are they
under suspicion or...?

313
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,539
Well...

314
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,379
Tell the truth: at the present time,
the family are not under suspicion.

315
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,680
OK.

316
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,820
Right.

317
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,359
Head office haven't rung me.

318
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,750
Oh, we didn't tell them
we were coming, love.

319
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,179
You should really speak
to someone from London.

320
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,969
We just want to see his office,

321
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,419
see if we can get an idea
of his day to day, you know.

322
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,880
Are his family OK?

323
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,160
Very shocked.

324
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,059
I would send a card, only...

325
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,350
Well, what do you say?

326
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,200
Right.

327
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,710
He was only in Friday.

328
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,200
Was he... himself?

329
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,019
I'd say he's definitely
been quieter recently.

330
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,120
But maybe there was a
lot going on at home.

331
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,380
And what about at work?

332
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,890
There was a fatality on
his watch, wasn't there?

333
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,509
You'd have to ask head office.
I'm not across the case.

334
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,390
If you can just give us the basics.

335
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,259
A lad,
Tom McKittrick,

336
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,399
got trapped under a crate.

337
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,109
His side tried to make
out the rig was faulty.

338
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,219
And "his side" being?

339
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,510
There's been a compo case.
Finished last month.

340
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,659
They tried to say it was dodgy,

341
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,659
but all the safety
checks were sound and...

342
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,459
And was it Owen's job
to do the safety checks?

343
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,300
Yes. Sign them off and log them
on the system, which he did.

344
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,299
That's why they found in our favour.

345
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,600
That and...

346
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,560
And what?

347
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,739
They found cannabis in Tom's blood.

348
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,699
After he died.

349
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,419
I'm not saying he was at fault but...

350
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,200
So, why are the people
here blaming Owen?

351
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,939
Tom's dad,

352
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,240
Mick,

353
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,939
he's been here years. People
might have listened.

354
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,459
And is this Mick here today?

355
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,650
No.
He left in June.

356
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,720
I think the polite word is breakdown.

357
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,939
So how does Mick's
compo being refused

358
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,460
tally timewise with that fight
outside the dockers' pub?

359
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,979
I think it was the day after.

360
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,859
So likely to be linked.

361
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,160
Aye, maybe.

362
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,859
Didn't get the money,
lost his rag.

363
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,380
A dry run for Saturday night.

364
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,790
Mick McKittrick?

365
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,219
- Yeah.
- Need to talk to you, love.

366
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,950
- DCI...
- Is this about Tom?

367
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,250
Have you found summat?

368
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,539
Is she all right?

369
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,840
His Ellie.

370
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,350
Shocked, I think.

371
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,000
That'll be tough for her.

372
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,550
I know how that one feels.

373
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,659
Why do you need me?

374
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,889
Well, it's our understanding

375
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,979
that you blamed Owen
for the death of your son.

376
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,339
I do, yeah.

377
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,919
- Yeah, I did.
- Can I ask why?

378
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,539
Look, Tom knew what he was doing.

379
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,040
So it stands to reason the
equipment wasn't right.

380
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,779
He'd watched me do
it since he was a kid.

381
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,350
Then why did the company say
that the check had been done?

382
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,150
They would, wouldn't they?

383
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,039
He'd been slacking off for
months, was common knowledge.

384
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,119
Why do you think the
lads are all on my side?

385
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,980
- In what way slacking off?
- I don't know. He'd checked out.

386
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,520
His mind was elsewhere.

387
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,989
15 years I've known him
and he wouldn't admit it.

388
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,480
Pulled rank on me,
lied to my face.

389
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,850
I deserved better than that.

390
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,609
- Did you have a ruck about it?
- No.

391
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,269
What about outside the Ship
about three weeks back?

392
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,570
No.

393
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,020
What about Saturday
night? Where were you?

394
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,640
I was at home.

395
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,800
Up Jacob's Creek
without a paddle.

396
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,930
I'll get Mick's phone checked
out, and his car.

397
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,059
Get the CSOs that cautioned
the fight brought in.

398
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,810
We'll do an ID.

399
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,639
Now,
Owen...

400
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,899
told community the
fight was his fault, right?

401
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,200
Yeah.

402
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,249
Now,
if Mick had gone for him outside

403
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,510
that pub and Owen didn't say...

404
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,530
could that be because he felt
guilty about the cover-up?

405
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,360
Maybe.

406
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,990
Explains why he took the blame.

407
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,139
- Possibility, isn't it?
- Yeah.

408
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,739
Maybe that's why
he didn't mention

409
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,590
the accident to his family.
Couldn't look 'em in the eye.

410
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,319
Bring the family back in.
Let's get a formal statement.

411
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,339
And get on to HSE, see if you can
clock anything they've missed.

412
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,900
No, not the crack team
from the safety squad?

413
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,119
Voilא.
Owen's phone.

414
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,689
- Good as new.
- Get anything off it?

415
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,299
Seven calls from
a withheld number

416
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,610
within the 10 minutes
prior to his death.

417
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,050
So someone was badgering him.

418
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,849
Right, see if you can trace that
withheld number. Top priority.

419
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,210
Oh, no, hang on. Kenny, give
me McKittrick's phone.

420
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,939
Right.

421
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,250
Let's see if Owen's on here.

422
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,000
Yep.

423
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,739
Mick McKittrick.

424
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,350
So it wasn't Mick ringing
him on the night.

425
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,979
What about texts?

426
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,309
Deleted from the handset.
Getting them from the server.

427
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,320
He cleared his handset?

428
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,940
Well, what was he up to?

429
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,820
Eye off the ball at work,
drinking,

430
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,150
family all saying
"Nothing to see here".

431
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,899
Did we place Cameron
at his mate's house?

432
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,699
Yeah. Greg confirmed and the
neighbours saw him returning,

433
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,050
shortly before we arrived
with the mum and his sister.

434
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,530
Do you want something?

435
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,579
Sorry... Bethany said to come
as soon as I found anything.

436
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,979
Well, I've been trawling
through the street CCTV.

437
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,280
Right.

438
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,979
Yeah, that's Owen.

439
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,739
- Who's the other fella?
- I don't know.

440
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,950
Well, get this blown up,
see if uniform can get an ID.

441
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,259
I know him!

442
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,469
Logan Tilley. Drug dealer.

443
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,499
Minor league.
More a delivery boy than a player.

444
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,419
Well, Owen didn't have anything
in his bloodstream, did he?

445
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,720
No.

446
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,300
So what's his business
with our victim?

447
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,650
Anyone?
Police!

448
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,579
- Right, put a call out for him.
- Ma'am.

449
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,020
Oi, I've got my eye on that!

450
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,100
Hi, it's me. Can you get me
an all-points on Logan Tilley?

451
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,559
Right,
uniform are out looking for him,

452
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,449
but there's been a development
on Mick McKittrick.

453
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,719
He's used his
travel pass on a bus

454
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,299
from Hattington to Newcastle
about 6pm.

455
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,019
So, he lied about where he was.

456
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,300
And we can place him in Newcastle
at the same time as Owen.

457
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,660
And I felt sorry for him an' all.

458
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,700
Here we go.

459
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,650
There he is.

460
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,310
Just take him through.

461
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,399
What's his excuse for lying to us?

462
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,120
Riding the buses
to save on heating.
Said he forgot.

463
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,490
You weren't at home. We know
that. So where were you?

464
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,810
Come on,
it's for your own sake.

465
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,009
Look, you're well
known to have a grudge,

466
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,609
so we've got our motive.

467
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,999
So, come on, Mick,
stop me chasing my tail.

468
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,580
Where were you?

469
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,050
I valet cars,
near the station.

470
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,359
I've started claiming disability,
so I didn't want to say.

471
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,390
Ooh, taking advantage of
the great British taxpayer?

472
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,750
They've cut the legal
aid. I'm desperate.

473
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,480
I thought I'd pay the money
back when I got the compo.

474
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,579
So, check out the car wash.

475
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,639
And while you're at it, take
in my motor. There's a love.

476
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,599
Get 'em to pull a hoover through.

477
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,280
Keys are in my coat.

478
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,839
- What have we got?
- Logan's file.

479
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,099
No violence.
Mainly drug offences.

480
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,929
Intent to supply,
possession.

481
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,389
Court appearance
for child neglect?

482
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,699
Yeah.

483
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,259
Lost custody in March 2012

484
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,669
after child was left home alone.

485
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,930
Currently in...
foster care.

486
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,840
That's Lila's dad, isn't it?

487
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,250
Just bumped into him
while I was getting chips.

488
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,160
OK.

489
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,499
So why didn't you mention it, hm?

490
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,179
I thought I did.

491
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,480
No.

492
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,369
Did you speak to him yourself, love?

493
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,010
Dad...
Owen...

494
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,789
- wouldn't let me.
- Why not?

495
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,970
Just knew I'd get upset again.

496
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,450
You didn't know she'd seen him.

497
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,950
She hadn't mentioned it...

498
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,570
but she's traumatised.

499
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,750
Maybe that's why.

500
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,339
Had she been in touch with him?

501
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,440
No.
We'd have come down on that.

502
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,980
Does she ever conceal things?

503
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,400
No.

504
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,250
Not any more.

505
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,849
Since we've had her,
she's a changed girl.

506
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,450
Responsible, kind, confident.

507
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,150
That's why we're so proud of her.

508
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,429
- Had you been in regular contact?
- No.

509
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,899
Not at all.

510
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,109
So when did you last see him?

511
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,660
You know, prior to the chippy.

512
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,820
When I got to the prom...

513
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,300
Logan was waiting for me.

514
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,100
Said he wanted to see me in my dress.

515
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,680
Take me in.

516
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,779
Dads weren't even supposed
to be there.

517
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,530
Owen would have come
if they were.

518
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,279
Anyway,
he started slagging off Owen,

519
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,919
saying he didn't care
about me and stuff.

520
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,080
I got upset,
he left.

521
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,650
My form teacher rang
and Owen picked me up.

522
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,209
Do you think he followed
you to the car park?

523
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,539
I don't know.
But...

524
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,169
He wants me to live with him.

525
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,999
He's not going to do something
that gets himself in trouble.

526
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,939
- Do you want to live with him?
- No.

527
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,989
I want them to adopt me.

528
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,870
They're the ones that love me.

529
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,750
He doesn't.

530
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,840
Lila,
if you've not been in contact,

531
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,460
how did he know about the prom?

532
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,419
He looks at my feed.
All the time.

533
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,720
Makes comments.

534
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,340
He just won't leave me alone.

535
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,520
"Best night ever!"

536
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,619
"Best family ever."

537
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,839
Told uniform it was
to send a message

538
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,569
to the girls in her form.

539
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,449
Send a message to her
dad more like.

540
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,859
Not exactly to rub
his nose in it

541
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,519
but to make her point.

542
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,820
Poor lass.

543
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,950
Hold it. That one's
taken at the car park.

544
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,220
So if Logan saw that,

545
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,500
he could have tracked
them to the car park.

546
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,689
Well, I'm banned from the
city centre, aren't I?

547
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,349
- I've got an ASBO on me.
- Well, you broke that.

548
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,559
You tracked your daughter to
her school dance, city centre,

549
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,219
and you were caught
on CCTV in the alley,

550
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,419
back of Castle Street chippy.

551
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,739
Right, so I'm not allowed
to eat chips now?

552
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,759
Where you had an altercation
with Owen Thorne.

553
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,579
- So?
- So,

554
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,450
So, he was found dead
20 minutes later.

555
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,610
I didn't know that.

556
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,640
Is Lila all right?

557
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,630
Not really.

558
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,759
Well, does that mean they
won't get to adopt her?

559
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,580
Is that what you want it to mean?

560
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,450
Why did you go and see her?

561
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,959
I just wanted to say goodbye
before the adoption, that's all.

562
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,619
To see her in her prom dress.

563
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,299
Why? Last time you had a contact
appointment, you failed to turn up.

564
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,719
But that's because I had
to sign this thing in.

565
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,339
See,
they screwed me over.

566
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,679
I asked for an appointment
I could make.

567
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,620
What did you say to
Owen in the alley?

568
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,940
I just wanted to apologise
to my daughter, that's all.

569
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,680
I know I upset her.

570
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,650
But he sent me packing,

571
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,590
made me look daft.

572
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,570
And he loved that, didn't he?
A power trip.

573
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,439
- And you just left it at that, did you?
- Yeah.

574
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,320
I called him a filthy pervert
and then I went on my way.

575
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,720
I mean,

576
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,110
what kind of a man wants to live
with other people's children, hm?

577
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,739
Look,
he's got her sucked in.

578
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,059
Just take a look at
her Facebook page.

579
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,859
It's all "Best ever dad!"

580
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,020
But they don't love her like I do.

581
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,479
They're not her blood.

582
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,459
And did you love her when you left
her without food for days on end,

583
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,800
whilst you went on a bender?

584
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,260
I had an illness.

585
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,900
When she's older, she'll understand.

586
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,289
Right,
arrest him on suspicion of murder

587
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,969
and get him a solicitor.

588
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,779
Get DNA swabs couriered
over to Marcus.

589
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,479
And get a blood test done.
Let's see if he's clean.

590
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,789
- Got all that?
- Got it.

591
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,059
Right, now, we are moving
our focus to this fella,

592
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,299
Logan Tilley.
That's Lila's father.

593
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,919
Now, possible motive:
an argument over Lila.

594
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,459
Maybe trying to scupper
the adoption altogether.

595
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,819
That was the tagging company.

596
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,879
Good. Can they place
Tilley at the car park?

597
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,629
No. Their GPS puts
Tilley in Morrisons

598
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,820
at the same time Owen's putting
money in the machine.

599
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,760
Right.

600
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,509
OK.
Change of plan,

601
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,089
don't arrest him on
suspicion of murder.

602
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,050
Caution him for breaking the ASBO.

603
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,520
Well, we're back to square
one, then, aren't we?

604
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,869
Ma'am. Ma'am.
Mobile data's come through.

605
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,019
The victim's last text was
to someone called Hannah.

606
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,329
Hannah who?

607
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:17,430
He says, "Sorry, can't make it
tonight. Bit under the weather."

608
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,430
"Under the weather"?

609
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,980
Well, no-one else has mentioned Owen
being under the weather, have they?

610
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,399
So is that before
or after the message

611
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,339
to pick up Lila from the prom?

612
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,780
It's before. Hannah
replies "No worries."

613
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,400
And a photo comes
up with her contact.

614
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,729
Right, well, ring her.

615
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,380
- Let's get her in.
- Phone's out of service.

616
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,780
Sim's been taken out.

617
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,080
Hannah...

618
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,829
Is this about Logan?

619
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,179
No.

620
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,159
No, we're no longer treating
him as a suspect.

621
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,469
See?

622
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,799
It were never going to
be your fault. Never.

623
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,420
You got that?

624
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,700
We were wondering if
you could ID someone.

625
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,429
I don't know her.
Who is she?

626
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,430
Just someone we're trying to trace.

627
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,300
Why?

628
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,480
How about you, pet?

629
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,320
No, I don't recognise her.

630
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,249
Well, we think your husband
was in communication with her

631
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,999
just before he died.

632
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,699
Now, did he tell you
he was meeting anyone?

633
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,059
No. He said he was staying in.

634
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,179
Is it possible he could
have lied about that?

635
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,930
Or changed his plans?

636
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,789
Maybe.

637
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,100
If he had a good reason, I suppose.

638
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,280
Cam, is this girl a friend of yours?

639
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,509
No. No.
She...

640
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,019
She, erm... I think she volunteers
with Dad down at Jump Start.

641
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,879
Right.
Well, that makes sense.

642
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,609
He did some mentoring.
With a homeless charity.

643
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,319
Yeah. He met loads
of people down there.

644
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,629
Yeah.

645
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,350
Right. Well, thanks very
much. We'll look into that.

646
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,760
I did wonder if it was the same
Owen when I heard it on the radio.

647
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,090
It's sad. It's really sad.

648
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,510
How long did he volunteer?

649
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,359
Perhaps a year, maybe longer.

650
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,839
He was very good.

651
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,249
He was quite experienced
with young people

652
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,579
who were troubled.

653
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,590
Did this girl volunteer with him?

654
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,659
No, that's Hannah Ferris.

655
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,549
She was a service user.

656
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,850
Right.

657
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,619
So did you pair them up?

658
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,160
He brought her in to us.

659
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,850
Is that what normally happens?

660
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,949
No.
Normally social services

661
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,859
refer care leavers.

662
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,859
But she was begging, I think.

663
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,379
She was in a terrible state,
weighed about six stone.

664
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,189
He asked us to get her
into accommodation.

665
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,219
Did that strike you as odd?

666
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,019
Not really. I mean, we knew him.

667
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,039
She was desperate.

668
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,820
It seemed legitimate.

669
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,000
It was, wasn't it?

670
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,699
It's not exactly the five-star
treatment, is it?

671
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,650
If he was trying to
pull a fast one...

672
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,089
She pays on time.

673
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,389
Any trouble, incidents?

674
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,179
No, not like some.

675
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,379
- How long has she been living here?
- Been here nearly six months.

676
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,179
Works funny hours.

677
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,650
Doing what?

678
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,249
Is she local?

679
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,509
I'd say she's Mancunian
from her accent.

680
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,950
Have you seen this fella?

681
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,899
Aye, yeah, I have.

682
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,979
Parks his Chrysler out front.

683
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,359
Well, once, more than once?

684
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,559
Once a week maybes.

685
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,510
He said he was a mate but I
presumed he was, you know...

686
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,750
A client.

687
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,590
- Hannah Ferris?
- Yeah.

688
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,779
DCI Stanhope.

689
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,590
We're investigating the
death of Owen Thorne.

690
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,359
Right, yeah.
I heard.

691
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,939
What do you want me for?

692
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,680
Could we have a little chat?

693
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,880
OK.

694
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,900
Could you check with my supervisor?
Only, I've had my break.

695
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,059
Do you remember receiving
this text from Mr. Thorne?

696
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,699
"Sorry, can't make it tonight,
bit under the weather."

697
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,419
Now, that was sent
7:30 Saturday evening.

698
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,890
Yeah, course.

699
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,809
Why were you meeting up?

700
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,699
It was my birthday.

701
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,969
A bunch of us were
meeting in the pub.

702
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,229
He said he might drop in
if he was in the area.

703
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,239
Can we see your phone?

704
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,159
I lost it Saturday night.

705
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,889
I think it got nicked.

706
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,459
How did you and Owen first meet?

707
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,499
This charity, Jump Start.

708
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,139
Now, that's not what they told us.

709
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,579
Well, it was.

710
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,319
I was begging.

711
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,449
He found me and they
sorted me out a room.

712
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,019
And when was that?

713
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,739
About six months back.

714
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,609
And you've been friends since?

715
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,579
Not friends.

716
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,859
We just met up every so often.

717
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,910
Talk about "life skills".

718
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,280
Where did you meet?

719
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,139
He'd pick me up, we'd go
to coffee shops and stuff.

720
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,969
- So you met at home?
- Yeah. It wasn't a big thing.

721
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,689
If I'm honest, I think he was trying

722
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:51,339
to tick a box that he'd
helped vulnerable adults.

723
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,919
They were adopting. Looks
good on the form.

724
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,450
Your landlady thought he
might have been "a client".

725
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,139
No, he bloody wasn't.

726
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,959
For God's sake! I'm not
some sort of crackhead.

727
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,699
I barely knew him, if I'm honest.

728
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,219
That didn't stop you inviting
him to your birthday party.

729
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,279
- I invited loads of people.
- Bit weird, isn't it?

730
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,789
- Man twice your age.
- It's not weird at all.

731
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,240
I wasn't sleeping with him if
that's what you're getting at.

732
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,979
Ask 'em. Go on, ask them.

733
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,699
Ask Caz, ask Mario.

734
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,159
He's my manager. He's twice my age.

735
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,690
They all came.

736
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,939
Owen said he was sick.

737
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,499
I was like, "No worries".

738
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,819
Why are you even asking me?

739
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,539
Well, he didn't mention to his
family that he was meeting you.

740
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,419
Now,
why do you think that is?

741
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,190
I don't know.
Maybe...

742
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,950
he had other plans
or just forgot.

743
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,459
Can I get back to it?

744
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,910
Honestly, I don't know any
more about how he passed.

745
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,250
Where are you from originally?

746
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,750
What's that accent, Manchester?

747
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,350
Rochdale, but yeah.

748
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,589
I had some mates come
to college up here.

749
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,150
Sort of fell out with them.

750
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,690
Well, we will be checking your
movements on Saturday evening.

751
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,179
Look, it's not ideal, is it, pet?

752
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,309
A B&B on the Longley Road.

753
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,039
Can you not go home?

754
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,659
You got any family?

755
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,020
My mum...
passed away.

756
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,539
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

757
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,210
I got back on my feet.

758
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,190
Could you pass on my condolences
to Ellie and stuff?

759
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,419
- He talked about his family, then?
- Yeah.

760
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,479
Banged on about how love can
turn people's lives around.

761
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,100
Soppy git like that.

762
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,379
- Where's Bethany?
- She's double-checking alibis.

763
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,249
Right. You can do it.

764
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,509
Get on to the Care
System in Rochdale.

765
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,369
See if they can trace Hannah Ferris.

766
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,629
She says there's
nothing untoward and,

767
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:18,189
do you know what,
I'm inclined to believe her.

768
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,699
But then...

769
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,579
You know, a man that
age, a young lass.

770
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:25,359
Not open about her,
deletes her from his phone.

771
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,859
It all just smacks of
inappropriate, doesn't it?

772
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,819
And if he was, you know,
with younger women,

773
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,050
do we need to alert the Social
to safeguard the others?

774
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,059
Yeah, I think you do.
Err on the side of caution.

775
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:41,379
Ma'am, this just came in
from Forensics. A footprint.

776
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,099
They only found it
last night with the UV

777
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,389
right by the edge of
where he fell from.

778
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,059
And not just passing by,
they reckon.

779
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,309
That shape and size...

780
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,299
Got to be a woman's, hasn't it?

781
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,059
Ma'am, the pay-as-you-go that
called the victim on the night

782
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,139
was bought last year from a phone
shop in Heaton Chapel in -

783
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,670
- Manchester.
- Yes.

784
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,490
Brilliant, Kenny.
Brilliant.

785
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,459
We think it might have
been Hannah's phone

786
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,739
that called him
just before he died.

787
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,719
Please tell me her alibi
isn't stacking up.

788
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,699
Sorry. Work have got photos of
her downing shots on the night.

789
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,459
<i>Put her in Labyrinth</i> in Hattington
around time of death.

790
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,880
Right, get back to the
office when you can.

791
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,000
Ma'am!

792
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,639
What are you doing here? I thought
you were checking alibis.

793
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,949
I was checking Ellie's.

794
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:31,209
But I just drove over from
Hattington Leisure Centre.

795
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:35,190
It took me seven minutes less
than Ellie said it took her.

796
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,750
- Were you speeding?
- No.

797
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,659
Right.

798
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,750
So at a whisker,
she could have got here early,

799
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,419
pushed him over, or whatever,

800
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,769
and then doubled back
to make eyes at uniform

801
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,159
on the cordon.

802
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,990
- At a whisker.
- Well, a whisker is all it takes, pet.

803
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,730
OK, what about this?

804
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,799
Hannah's calling him over and over.

805
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,819
Why?
Let's not speculate.

806
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,449
We know she's drunk,
so maybe that's enough.

807
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,059
Mam turns up,

808
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,169
susses he's on the phone
to Hannah.

809
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:11,249
Jumps to conclusions,
rightly or wrongly.

810
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,029
Decides to confront him with it.

811
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:15,119
Follows him up to the
top of the car park.

812
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,409
- So that's what he sees on the CCTV?
- Yeah, well, it makes sense.

813
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:21,850
She confronts him,
there's a row and...

814
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,739
I don't buy it.
Timing's too tight.

815
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,899
- Sure she left at the end of the class?
- Yeah.

816
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,050
Where's that statement from
the fitness instructor?

817
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,600
There you go.

818
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,720
Oi!

819
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,459
I've not messed up the timing.
I spoke to her.

820
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,569
No, but you've missed
something else, pet.

821
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,230
- What?
- Get your coat.

822
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,690
That's her, isn't it?

823
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,560
Right, I might limp out there
on my own for this one.

824
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,069
<i>Hi, luv, it's only me.</i>

825
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:25,629
<i>Listen, I don't know if you
got the message about Lila?</i>

826
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:29,139
<i>If you don't call us back in 10 minutes,
I'll get myself over there. OK?</i>

827
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,440
<i>Have fun.</i>

828
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,429
Don't delete it, will you?

829
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:36,719
It's just... I nearly
did... Just automatic.

830
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,360
I won't delete it.

831
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,960
Why do you need to hear it?

832
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,279
Well, you told me you
picked up the message

833
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,859
about Lila at the end of the class?

834
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,650
And you drove straight up?

835
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:54,049
Yeah, and we checked with...
Jenny, was it?

836
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,209
- Jenny, yeah.
- Yeah, she confirmed you left at the end.

837
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:58,519
Exactly.

838
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,940
But can I read you her statement?

839
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,340
She says,

840
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,869
"Ellie told me she was going
to pick up Lila early,

841
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:12,859
so I cancelled the
Turkish in the break."

842
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,190
Yeah, we were going to
go for a meal after.

843
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,100
"And then after class Ellie
left straight away."

844
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,139
That's what I said, wasn't it?

845
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,550
Well, no.

846
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:28,520
No, you said you picked up the
message at the end of class.

847
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,990
But if she cancelled the
Turkish in the break,

848
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:36,540
you must have got the
message halfway through.

849
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,090
So why didn't you leave immediately?

850
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,890
Why was that?

851
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,720
I just wanted to do the class.

852
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,509
Ah, now, you see,

853
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:55,400
it strikes me you're
pretty devoted to Lila.

854
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,250
So it would have to be
a bigger reason than that

855
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:04,310
to leave the lass
in town in tears...

856
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,990
Were you angry with her, hm?

857
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,959
Or him?

858
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,260
No.

859
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,489
You see, love,

860
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:19,890
it's plausible we can place you in
the car park at the time of death.

861
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,739
So it'd be much
easier for both of us

862
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,510
if you'd just come clean.

863
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,450
Owen's not always
where he says he is.

864
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,710
There were a parking fine.

865
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,050
I found it hidden in his drawer.

866
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,240
For a time he was supposed
to be on shift.

867
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,780
And that night,

868
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,910
I got the feeling he were planning
something he weren't telling me.

869
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:56,100
So you thought,
if he picked Lila up,

870
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,899
then he wouldn't be
able to do whatever

871
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,900
it was you thought he might be doing?

872
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,499
Now, why didn't you tell
us that at the start?

873
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,010
I hoped it were paranoia.

874
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,340
Was he cheating on me?

875
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,200
I don't know, love.

876
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,240
Do you think he was?

877
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,689
I'm sensing it was awkward.

878
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:41,049
She had her suspicions.

879
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:43,099
Left it so he'd do the pick-up.

880
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,019
So admitted to motive?

881
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,980
At a stretch.

882
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,409
But I'm not getting the feeling

883
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:52,939
she'd be wound up enough
to give hubby a shove.

884
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,709
A woman scorned and all that.
Strength of 10 men.

885
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:59,179
Nah. I think she was more in denial.

886
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:02,819
Or what was it Logan
Tilley said about Lila?

887
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,129
"He had her sucked in."

888
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:08,240
Maybe Owen was just one of those blokes
that gets away with everything.

889
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,829
I don't know.

890
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,339
Maybe he was a good bloke

891
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,170
and this was just
a random encounter.

892
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,380
And that footprint, nothing
to do with him,

893
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:22,659
just to do with some other poor
soul trying to top themselves.

894
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,739
Or maybe he topped himself
over the sight of this.

895
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,909
90 quid for a tyre
over the line!

896
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:30,840
I've had worse.

897
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,550
Let me have another look at that.

898
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,899
5th of March.

899
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,219
8×m till midday parked
in Lovel Avenue.

900
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,979
- Doesn't ring a bell. Where's that?
- Not the place. The date.

901
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:49,259
It's when the crate fell
on that lad and killed him.

902
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,620
When Owen was supposedly
doing the safety checks.

903
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,979
<i>We can place Owen offsite</i>

904
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,839
at the time he was supposedly
checking the safety of the rig.

905
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,359
Do we know why Owen was
parked where he was?

906
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,339
Lovel Avenue,
right beside the car park at A&E

907
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,199
- at Mountford General.
- - He was at the hospital?

908
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,989
We're checking inpatients.

909
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:13,290
Right.

910
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,909
Kenny, how did the safety
squad miss this?

911
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:20,079
Well, he clocked in at the docks. And
the check was registered on the software

912
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,650
that monitors the procedures.

913
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,989
Could that be tampered with?

914
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,239
Head office said it's inputted
from a computer on site,

915
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,180
so I'm guessing, aye.

916
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,840
Right.

917
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,640
Gloria.

918
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:46,170
- No.
- OK.

919
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:50,460
Now, the day that lad was killed.

920
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,900
Did you sign Owen
in as being at work

921
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,369
when he wasn't?

922
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:59,050
Cos somebody did.

923
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,280
He rang first thing.

924
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,520
Said he was running late.

925
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,719
Some family crisis or other.

926
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,329
I said I'd clock him in anyhow,

927
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:20,530
so he wouldn't have
to use his leave.

928
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,019
I know it's wrong.

929
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:26,789
I just thought I was turning a blind
eye. He was usually reliable.

930
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,320
We heard he was slacking off.

931
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,440
If he was, I had not picked up on it.

932
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:38,049
Mm. So you went into the system
and falsified the checks?

933
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:41,050
He said he'd done it,
just hadn't had time to log it.

934
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,469
- Do you still believe that?
- I did.

935
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:47,959
But...
maybe he convinced me.

936
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,770
To what?
Cover it up?

937
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,359
Never mind the truth, never
mind Mick McKittrick?

938
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,559
At the time I was trying
to do him a favour.

939
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,759
I knew he was stressed at home.

940
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,229
He thought he could lose his daughter
if he was under a cloud.

941
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,389
It seemed like too big a price

942
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:07,279
just cos he'd not ticked
a box on the system.

943
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,470
I believed it at the time.

944
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,290
So what was the family crisis?

945
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,840
I don't know.

946
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,779
What, all that hoo-ha
and you never asked?

947
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,660
We didn't go over it and over it.

948
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,800
It was a white lie...

949
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,850
that snowballed.

950
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,859
Gloria Edwards covered up for Owen,

951
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:40,459
clocked him in
when he was at the hospital.

952
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,169
Now, would you check her alibi?

953
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:45,449
Says she was eating alone
at a restaurant on Quayside.

954
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,259
- So she was in the area?
- She was in town, yes.

955
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,169
- Mystery woman on the roof?
- Yeah, could be.

956
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:51,629
I mean, she
could have got there on foot.

957
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,319
What is it, a 10-minute walk?

958
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,449
What about the cover-up's
turned sour?

959
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:58,179
She's threatening to blow the
lid on it, or he is or both are,

960
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,719
have a massive row and over he goes.

961
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,029
Yeah, maybe.

962
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:05,630
But then you'd think they'd want
to stick together, wouldn't you?

963
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,619
Get on to the hospital, find
out why Owen was there.

964
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,909
And Helen,
get on to health and safety,

965
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:15,510
tell them we've got new
information on Tom McKittrick.

966
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,400
That's one thing we
can resolve at least.

967
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,200
It doesn't mean the rig was faulty.

968
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,179
But, well...

969
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:37,880
Doctored paper trail,
you'd definitely have a case.

970
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,999
I'm not sure I could face it.

971
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,449
You might get your compo.

972
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:48,880
I didn't want the money. I wanted
to know it wasn't Tom's fault.

973
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,659
Doesn't take away the
cannabis, does it?

974
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,260
No, well...

975
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,539
I should have known.

976
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,700
Somehow stopped him.

977
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,090
What was Owen doing?

978
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:10,499
Was he down the Ship?

979
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,060
Well, we think he might
have been at the hospital.

980
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,059
So, it... it might be
a good reason, like?

981
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,080
I mean, not just he
didn't give a damn?

982
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,939
I can barely remember last
week, let alone March.

983
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,739
Was there some kind of family
problem that morning?

984
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,179
No.
I'd remember.

985
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:57,379
Mrs. Thorne, think.
Please. It's important.

986
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,689
Do you think I'm lying?

987
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:00,969
Well, I think if there
was a family problem,

988
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:03,549
particularly one involving
an A&E admission,

989
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,039
you might want to conceal it.
Yes.

990
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,449
Why? Why would I do any of this?

991
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:10,399
Well, for starters social
services were watching you,

992
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,959
assessing you week in,
week out.

993
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,660
And you had a lot riding
on that going well.

994
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,019
Now, did something happen to Lila?

995
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,320
No!

996
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:22,439
If something happened,
we'd have been honest.

997
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,249
We didn't go round telling
lies, covering stuff up.

998
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,009
You told me this
morning your husband

999
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,990
wasn't particularly
open with you.

1000
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:32,129
It's this girl.
What were he doing with her?

1001
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:33,509
We don't know for sure.

1002
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,319
- Tell me.
- Mum, he wouldn't have.

1003
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,739
- He loved you.
- Give me her number, I'll ask her.

1004
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,049
- Just get it out in the open.
- You can't do that.

1005
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:41,239
- What do I do?
- Just sit here in limbo,

1006
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,009
waiting for the
next slap in t'face?

1007
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:45,739
Is it down to you they're putting
the adoption on hold?

1008
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,909
It might be, yes.

1009
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:51,249
We're obliged to tell them we're still
making inquiries into your family.

1010
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,350
- I'm sorry.
- Well, thanks for that.

1011
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:55,880
Thanks.

1012
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,070
That was the only thing
keeping her going.

1013
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,259
Her name's Gloria Edwards.

1014
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,070
Yes, I saw her.

1015
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,039
She was on her own.

1016
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,719
Did she make a reservation?

1017
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,639
Table five is set
aside for walk-ins.

1018
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,349
So probably not.

1019
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:31,050
But she was here,
for sure.

1020
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,660
Here you are.

1021
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,500
Right.

1022
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,979
So the day Owen
goes AWOL from work...

1023
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,499
.. and he's parked outside
Mountford General,

1024
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,939
there's a female admitted
under the name of Ferris

1025
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,959
- for alcohol poisoning.
- Hannah?

1026
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,969
Well, the patient's taken home
before she can be properly admitted.

1027
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:11,459
So the nurse writes her
off as a time-waster.

1028
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,109
But we know that Hannah
gets off her face.

1029
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,859
- So...
- So?

1030
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:18,539
I'm thinking Hannah
gets messed up.

1031
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,449
She wants attention,

1032
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:22,689
she wants him to come
running after her.

1033
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:25,659
- What, she's pretending?
- Well, maybe it's a false alarm.

1034
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,339
He gets back to work by midday.

1035
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,489
But he can't tell
'em the real reason

1036
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,610
why he's late for the safety
checks because...

1037
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,550
- .. well, he's in a relationship.
- Right.

1038
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,990
You know who she put down?
Her fancy man, as next of kin.

1039
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,419
Come on, boss, even you've
got to be impressed with that.

1040
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:45,339
I am, pet.
I am.

1041
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,699
Except you're missing the obvious.

1042
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:51,739
He's not her fancy man,
he IS her next of kin.

1043
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,040
Come on!

1044
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,239
My mum found his details
on the internet.

1045
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,809
You said your mum was dead.

1046
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,449
Before she died.

1047
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:12,139
I found them stored on the
laptop. I came looking.

1048
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,869
So all that stuff about
you begging was a lie?

1049
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:16,679
He wanted to give
me money for rent.

1050
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,160
I said no.

1051
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,919
But I was hard up,

1052
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,380
so I let him refer me to the charity.

1053
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,979
Was he glad you made contact?

1054
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:29,870
Yeah, we had a big family party.

1055
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,980
Look, I was a mess.

1056
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,600
He wasn't exactly thrilled but
he wasn't made of stone either.

1057
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,219
Why did you come looking?

1058
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,830
I just did.
Wouldn't you?

1059
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:48,329
I'm not saying everyone
has to be 2.4 kids.

1060
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:50,739
But you need to know where
you come from, don't you?

1061
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,699
And where do you come from?

1062
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,299
A one-nighter.

1063
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,149
He was quite open about that.

1064
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:57,639
Before they adopted Cameron,

1065
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:00,450
him and Ellie, I think,
were having a bit of a bad time.

1066
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:03,839
I think with the fertility
treatment and all that.

1067
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,799
Anyway, this one night he goes
out, gets it on with my mum.

1068
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,210
Bang.
That's me, one-hit wonder.

1069
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,120
You can see why he didn't
want his wife to know.

1070
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,660
It's not nice, is it?

1071
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:26,499
So he didn't actually have
a relationship with your mam?

1072
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,019
No.

1073
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,829
He knocked her up...

1074
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:32,699
She asked but he wasn't interested.

1075
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:35,939
So she moved to Manchester
to start again.

1076
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,850
Got married...
for about two minutes.

1077
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,979
It's like she told me.

1078
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:45,009
Getting pregnant with
me ruined her life.

1079
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:48,290
But, you know, I'm over it.

1080
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:57,620
Why did she look for
him on the internet?

1081
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,899
Torture herself I think.

1082
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,230
She was a bit crackers if I'm honest.

1083
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,940
How'd your mam die?

1084
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,820
Topped herself.

1085
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,710
Do you blame your dad at all?
For the rejection.

1086
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,570
Not so as I'd kill him.

1087
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:28,609
How'd you feel about him
missing your birthday, hm?

1088
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:31,059
Something came up probably.

1089
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,109
We weren't his priority.

1090
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:35,550
Honestly, I didn't mind.

1091
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,660
Right.

1092
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,799
Why were you hospitalised?

1093
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,059
- When?
- Few months back.

1094
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,539
March.

1095
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:46,180
No.
Don't know anything about that.

1096
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,199
I'll chase the hospital,
see if she's lying.

1097
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,829
Well, that doesn't alter the fact
that at the time of death

1098
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:58,869
she was in a club with her mates.

1099
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:01,530
Think, what does this mean?

1100
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:04,890
Him having another kid.

1101
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,819
Biological one at that.

1102
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:12,259
It certainly gives Mam something
to be hacked off about, doesn't it?

1103
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,779
Possible.

1104
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:17,250
Let's bring her in,
do a formal interview.

1105
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:21,259
Or should I be looking at Lila?

1106
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,499
A girl that age capable of...?

1107
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,900
Ma'am, this fella's
been waiting an hour.

1108
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,619
It's that docker.

1109
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:32,090
- Are you waiting for me?
- Yeah.

1110
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,899
We've heard.

1111
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,869
You've heard what?

1112
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:39,159
That you've got
Mick his evidence.

1113
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,219
Right, yes. Yes, we have.

1114
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,750
That's good news.

1115
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:47,120
Well, where I'm from, one
good turn deserves another.

1116
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,739
I saw the fight.

1117
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:55,169
- The fight outside the pub?
- Yeah.

1118
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:57,429
And he wasn't being vicious.
He just...

1119
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:59,259
pushed him and Owen
fell on his back.

1120
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,019
Bang, straight on the kerb.

1121
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,079
Didn't know his own strength,
I'd say.

1122
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,610
Who pushed him?
Was this Mick McKittrick?

1123
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,440
No.

1124
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:15,180
It was Cameron,
his son.

1125
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,259
He's not picking up his mobile.

1126
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:35,079
This Greg definitely
vouched for Cameron?

1127
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,850
- Yeah.
- Get Kenny to double-check.

1128
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,699
Did you trace his
mobile on the night?

1129
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,700
No, cos his friend vouched for him.

1130
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,490
Lila...
Lila, love...

1131
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,290
I'm looking for Cameron.
Do you know where he is, love?

1132
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,139
Yeah.
He's working.

1133
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:59,489
Great.

1134
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:01,019
Thanks.

1135
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,899
At Hattington Golf Course.

1136
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,200
Right.

1137
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,190
Are you all right?

1138
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,200
No.

1139
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,120
What's up?

1140
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,810
They're saying they have to move me.

1141
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,700
I'm sorry.

1142
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,129
I'm sorry.

1143
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,459
I'm going to have to
ask you something, pet.

1144
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:31,980
Now, did Cameron and
Owen have a falling out?

1145
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:34,339
Within the last month.

1146
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:37,399
Right, are you going
to ruin HIS life now?

1147
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,009
No. I'm only asking
because a witness said

1148
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:41,829
he thought they might
have had a fight.

1149
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:43,880
- Did they?
- They did, yeah.

1150
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:45,960
What was it about?

1151
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,980
Dad was cheating on Mum.

1152
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,259
With that homeless girl.

1153
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:54,419
Saw his car outside where she lives.

1154
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,179
Cam went ballistic about it.

1155
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:58,080
Owen told him he'd got it wrong.

1156
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:00,909
We believed him.

1157
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:02,210
Right.

1158
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,629
But you know different, don't you?

1159
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,830
That's why you're looking
for her, isn't it?

1160
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,699
He's on compassionate leave.

1161
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:18,659
His sister was under the
impression he was working today.

1162
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:21,179
Yeah, I mean, he did come on
earlier but I sent him home.

1163
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,489
Why's that?

1164
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:24,349
He were caddying for some
fellas on a corporate.

1165
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:26,339
But he started to get upset.

1166
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:28,059
Lost it with them,
I think.

1167
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:29,800
Right, thanks, mate.

1168
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,479
Unaccounted for since
11am this morning.

1169
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,019
We need to speak to him in connection
with an assault on his dad

1170
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,720
three weeks prior to the murder.

1171
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:55,219
DCI Stanhope.

1172
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:58,339
<i>Hello,
it's Jayne-Anne from Jump Start.</i>

1173
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:01,299
We've had a lad in looking
for info on Hannah Ferris.

1174
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,300
- Right, what did you tell him?
- Nothing. We have procedures.

1175
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,719
But he was quite angry.

1176
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,139
<i>I think he may have been Owen's son.</i>

1177
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:10,440
Thanks, love.

1178
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:22,049
Let's see if we can find
Hannah before Cameron does.

1179
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:23,950
Bring her in as a precaution.

1180
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,320
Hello?

1181
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,640
Hannah?

1182
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:12,780
He'll have seen this.

1183
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:18,099
SEAT Leon, registration
Alpha Charlie Foxtrot.

1184
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,459
Male, early twenties.

1185
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,790
Possibly with Hannah Ferris.

1186
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,179
- Scrap that.
- It's all right.

1187
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:27,579
- Alone.
- It's all right.

1188
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:30,619
We think Owen's son Cameron
has been looking for you.

1189
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,429
They've found the car
but not the driver.

1190
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:34,359
That's good.
If he's on foot it'll be easier.

1191
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,699
He's back in coverage.

1192
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:38,899
- We've got him down by the docks.
- Right, get uniform down there.

1193
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,339
But don't scare him off.

1194
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:44,180
Might have a bee in his bonnet and
we don't want anyone getting stung.

1195
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,490
Keep your distance.
We're on our way.

1196
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,520
Why were you looking for Hannah?

1197
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:09,690
I just want a straight answer.

1198
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:11,939
Mum's tearing herself to bits.

1199
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,079
Is that why you knocked
your dad about last month,

1200
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,380
to get a straight answer?

1201
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:19,690
You see, we find these
things out eventually.

1202
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,939
Was he lying to me?

1203
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:24,419
I grovelled to him
because I thought I'd got it wrong.

1204
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:28,539
Well, as far as we can tell,
he was not having an affair.

1205
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,659
Not with Hannah, anyway.

1206
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:33,110
Why are you so sure
he was carrying on?

1207
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,160
I'm not.

1208
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:39,769
Look,

1209
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:43,559
if I tell you,
you can't tell Mum, OK?

1210
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,469
She's hurt enough as it is.

1211
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:46,980
All right, come on.

1212
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:52,330
The day he died,

1213
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:54,690
a reminder popped up on his phone,

1214
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:58,470
a booking for a restaurant
in Quayside.

1215
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:02,200
Now, if he wasn't up to something,
why didn't he tell us about it?

1216
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,480
Aiden...

1217
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:15,019
Get uniform down to the docks,

1218
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:17,419
tell them to bring
Gloria Edwards in.

1219
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:20,579
I think Owen might have been
meeting her at the restaurant.

1220
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,169
And, Helen, get on to Ellie,

1221
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:23,920
tell her her son's here.

1222
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:33,059
OK, thank you.

1223
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,369
Ma'am.

1224
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:37,059
The manager's saying there's
no booking in the name of Edwards.

1225
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:40,150
However, there was a booking
in the name of Ferris.

1226
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:46,920
Well, why would Hannah
have been there?

1227
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,989
Unless...
Hold on.

1228
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:56,719
Helen, did you find a record
of Hannah's mother's suicide?

1229
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,629
I didn't get a call back from
Manchester. I've been chasing...

1230
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,350
So we don't know for
certain she's dead.

1231
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,619
Right.

1232
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:26,479
Is your mother
Gloria Edwards

1233
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,210
who works with
Owen at the docks?

1234
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:34,650
You can tell me now or
I can look up the records

1235
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:38,690
and then arrest you for perverting
the course of justice.

1236
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:45,560
Yes!

1237
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:50,000
She went back to work there
in the last year, yes.

1238
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:54,450
Is Ferris your real name?

1239
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,550
It's the name of the
bloke she married.

1240
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,900
She does use it sometimes.

1241
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:05,510
Now, why did she come back
up here from Manchester?

1242
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:10,059
I was here. She wanted
to be close to me.

1243
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,629
Now, you see,
I think she came back up here

1244
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:15,690
- to reconnect with Owen.
- Maybe.

1245
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:17,739
Hiding to nothing there.

1246
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:21,230
I told you, she likes
to torture herself.

1247
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:23,699
Why did you tell us she was dead?

1248
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:25,019
I told you.

1249
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:27,529
Dad didn't want Ellie
knowing anything about me.

1250
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:29,910
So you were protecting
his family?

1251
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:35,030
See, I think you're
protecting your mam.

1252
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:37,250
But from what?

1253
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,889
We've checked with the restaurant.

1254
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,889
There was a birthday
meal booked for three,

1255
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:48,699
name of Ferris, cake on order.

1256
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,839
And neither you nor Owen turned up.

1257
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,859
I never had any other expectation.

1258
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,919
- So why book it?
- I didn't, Mum did.

1259
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,300
He wasn't interested,
I wasn't.

1260
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,379
I think she felt I was
too forgiving on him.

1261
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,989
She wanted him to prove he cared.

1262
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:10,509
To lie to his wife.
"Put us first."

1263
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:13,330
I told you,
she's crackers.

1264
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:16,019
And you weren't bothered?

1265
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,560
Not at all?

1266
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,509
I didn't want to turn
his life upside down.

1267
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:23,719
He loved his family.
I understood that.

1268
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,360
And he didn't love YOU?

1269
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,450
We barely knew each other.

1270
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:33,320
I'm not saying he didn't care but...

1271
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:38,560
Anyway, he politely
declined last minute.

1272
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:43,800
So why did your mam still
go to the Quayside?

1273
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,699
She just didn't get the message
till she got to the restaurant.

1274
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,450
Far as I know, she turned
around and went home.

1275
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:54,480
Ma'am,
uniform can't locate the...

1276
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,560
the suspect at the docks.

1277
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:10,899
I just wanted to offer
my condolences.

1278
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,290
In person.

1279
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:14,700
I'm Gloria.

1280
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,059
From the docks...

1281
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:20,780
Right.
Thank you.

1282
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:23,819
I were about to head out.

1283
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:25,370
I have to pick up my son.

1284
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,310
Would you like me to drive you down?

1285
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:31,750
It wouldn't be any trouble.

1286
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:42,859
Come on, love.

1287
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,599
- Where might she have gone?
- I don't know.

1288
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,779
I'd advise you to
stop protecting her.

1289
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:48,889
Course I'll protect her.
She's my mum!

1290
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:51,279
Ma'am.
They can't find Ellie at the house.

1291
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,039
But they found
her phone smashed

1292
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,599
with an aborted call to 999.

1293
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,839
Where is she?
Ask her where she'd go.

1294
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,249
<i>- Come back!</i>
- Ask her!

1295
01:14:58,250 --> 01:14:59,949
Not in here, son.
Get him out.

1296
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:01,909
- Get him out.
- Come on.

1297
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:05,749
<i>- She knows!</i>
- Hannah, help us out here, will you, love?

1298
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:09,620
Where shall we look?
Is there somewhere she
had a connection with?

1299
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,869
There's a causeway.
She talked about it before.

1300
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:18,170
What?

1301
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,790
Driving off it.

1302
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,319
Where are we going?

1303
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,849
Don't know.

1304
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:42,690
You can get out if you want.

1305
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,994
My daughter will be
waiting for me.

1306
01:15:44,995 --> 01:15:48,079
Well, if it's your
daughter needs attention,

1307
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,480
I'll drop everything, shall I?

1308
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:54,439
"We're not his priority."
That's what Hannah said.

1309
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:57,469
She told me! She bloody told
me her mother was still alive

1310
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,779
and I didn't spot it!

1311
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:01,689
That was her at the hospital,
not her daughter.

1312
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,379
Patient called Ferris.

1313
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:05,350
Crying alcohol poisoning.

1314
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,549
Only, that was a con, wasn't it?

1315
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:10,390
She calls, he comes running.

1316
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:14,579
<i>All units. DC Blake thinks they've
spotted her on the B23. Eastbound.</i>

1317
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:17,989
- That's back the other way.
<i>- .. assistance. Over.</i>

1318
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,890
I know these roads. Hang
on to your eyebrows.

1319
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,899
It was going on for years.

1320
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:36,730
- Right under your nose.
- I don't believe you.

1321
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,509
- It's all rubbish.
- It's not.

1322
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:41,819
He was waiting till Lila was sorted.

1323
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:43,459
That was all you cared about,
wasn't it?

1324
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:45,209
Staying together for
the sake of the kids.

1325
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:48,369
- It was tough for him.
- That's not what he said!

1326
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,399
You weren't seeing
him for years.

1327
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,029
Believe what you want.

1328
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:54,720
Never know for sure,
will you?

1329
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,360
- Go on, floor it!
- No, I don't want to encourage her.

1330
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:21,750
What's she doing? What's she doing?

1331
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,300
Ellie?

1332
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,049
It's all right.
Deep breaths.

1333
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:14,910
Help's here.
You're all right.

1334
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,020
It's all right.

1335
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,010
Ignore her, love.

1336
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:04,650
You did the right thing.

1337
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,459
So you're at the restaurant.

1338
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:20,350
No-one turns up.

1339
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,950
What happens next?

1340
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,879
I get the message, I go home.

1341
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,799
I don't believe that's true.

1342
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,429
Give us another one.

1343
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:32,730
Thanks.

1344
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,359
OK, then.

1345
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,259
Now, your daughter told us

1346
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:43,199
you like to track
Owen on the internet.

1347
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,119
Torture yourself with
what he's up to.

1348
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:50,960
So erm... let's have
a little look at this.

1349
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:56,500
Right, I think this
came up on your phone.

1350
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:04,499
Owen Thorne tagged having
a laugh in the city centre

1351
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,350
when he should've been with
you in the restaurant.

1352
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,350
Told lies, didn't he?
Said he was under the weather.

1353
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,889
This is rubbing it in,
isn't it?

1354
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:16,719
I didn't care.

1355
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,159
I just went home.

1356
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:21,430
No, you didn't, love.
You rang him, didn't you?

1357
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:26,139
And my money's on you told him
you were coming for a showdown.

1358
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:29,159
No, like I say, I went home.

1359
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,999
Well, that's funny,
cos GPS

1360
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,060
has mapped this phone,
your phone, to Eastgate.

1361
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,659
You phoned him seven
times in 10 minutes.

1362
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:42,159
- You were at the scene.
- No.

1363
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,019
- You were upset.
- I didn't give a damn.

1364
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:47,059
- And you'd gone to confront him.
- How would I do that?

1365
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:48,929
Have you seen the size of him?

1366
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:51,190
And the size of me.

1367
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,450
Hannah's also told us

1368
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,529
you have a history
of attempted suicide.

1369
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:04,030
Is that right?

1370
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:11,519
So did you threaten to throw yourself
off the top of that car park, love?

1371
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,720
Is that why Owen
was at the barrier?

1372
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,400
I just couldn't take it any more.

1373
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,680
Seeing what he was doing to Hannah.

1374
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,990
What?

1375
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:39,309
What was he doing to her?

1376
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:41,190
It ruined her.

1377
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,859
The rejection.
It ruined her.

1378
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:50,410
And the blatant lying.

1379
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,950
"Under the weather".

1380
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,429
Thinks it won't affect her.
Thinks she'll laugh it off.

1381
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:01,850
She won't.
Didn't eat for two years.

1382
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:05,059
I had to cope single-handed.

1383
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,920
That must have been tough.

1384
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:14,039
But is it possible that it's
you who felt rejected?

1385
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,679
That it was your hurt, not Hannah's?

1386
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,479
Me?

1387
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,399
I couldn't give a toss.

1388
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:24,359
I just went there to have
it out once and for all.

1389
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:27,159
He always put them first.

1390
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,519
Didn't matter who he had
to shove out the way.

1391
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,309
They weren't even his blood.

1392
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:35,559
So you went just to scare
the daylights out of him?

1393
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:38,400
At that moment, I meant to do it.

1394
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:46,760
Don't!

1395
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,620
But he sat next to me.

1396
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,950
Said he wanted me around.

1397
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,340
I...

1398
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,650
.. don't know...
how he slipped.

1399
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:37,060
But...
as we stood up...

1400
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,990
.. his balance went and...

1401
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:51,200
The last thing he did
was try to save my life.

1402
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,560
You know, love,

1403
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:05,540
I really would like to
think that were true.

1404
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:09,879
But that would be you having
the last word, wouldn't it?

1405
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,600
Against them.

1406
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:16,050
You see, if he'd slipped,

1407
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,680
chances are he'd have
landed feet first.

1408
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:24,070
But head first?

1409
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:28,279
Now that suggests something else.

1410
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,580
Either he dived...

1411
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:36,050
.. or you gave him a big old push.

1412
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:57,409
But thanks for clarifying
all the other details, pet.

1413
01:24:57,410 --> 01:24:59,450
I'll get back to you on them.

1414
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:02,090
Thanks, Gloria.

1415
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:00,780
We...

1416
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:03,099
just wanted to say thank you.

1417
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:04,839
For co-operating with them.

1418
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,790
I know that can't have been easy.

1419
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:19,550
If you want to stand up front
with us, that's fine.

1420
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:21,919
I know he wouldn't just want

1421
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,520
you to be a face in the crowd.
Not forever.

1422
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,360
That's something, anyway.

1423
01:26:49,870 --> 01:26:52,279
Do you think he'd have made
it right with them all after?

1424
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,910
When Lila was sorted and
all the dust was settled.

1425
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,079
Maybe.

1426
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:01,299
But in my experience, dust
never settles really, does it?

1427
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:02,600
In life.

1428
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:06,389
Come on.
We don't have to stay.

1429
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:07,990
Best private, I think.

1430
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:12,990
Let's go and have a drink to
the dust never settling on us.

1431
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,380
Boss.

1432
01:27:42,210 --> 01:27:43,510
Thanks.

1433
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,499
We could go for a proper
drink if you like.

1434
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,679
Or have you got to be somewhere?

1435
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,679
I never turn down a pint.

1436
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:56,559
- On me, though.
- Absolutely, mate.

1437
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,959
I've not exactly been
indispensable, have I, with my leg?

1438
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,269
No.

1439
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:03,739
That'll teach me
to try and equalise.

1440
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:06,950
Oh, I think you've equalised, pet.

1441
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,380
You've saved a life now, haven't you?

1442
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,020
So you're quits.

1443
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:20,280
Come on.

1444
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:33,580

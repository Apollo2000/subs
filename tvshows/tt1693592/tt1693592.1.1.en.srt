00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,750
"Where ru? Had a great night XXX"

4
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,020
Hiya.

5
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,700
Luke?

6
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,920
Laura?

7
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,500
What you doing?

8
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,880
Luke?

9
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,380
Luke, son!

10
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,180
Luke...

11
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,680
Luke.

12
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,310
Son.

13
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,250
Luke darling.

14
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,920
Luke!

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,850

Based on the book "Hidden
Depths" by Ann Cleeves

18
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,310
Two minutes
of your life!

19
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,510
He doesn't deserve this,
you know. No-one does.

20
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,290
You never met him.

21
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,060
No. You're right.

22
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,260
I just didn't know
who else to ask.

23
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,100
Yeah, come here, come here.
Just give us it here.

24
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,830
Howay, then.

25
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,190
Thanks, love.

26
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,100
Should we say a
prayer then or what?

27
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,980
- You not coming, then?
- What?

28
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,770
No. I'll just...

29
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,360
Come on.

30
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,590
You're all right. I'll just...

31
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,960
Here.

32
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,330
- Yeah.
- Drink up.

33
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,850
Cheers.

34
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,140
Glad that's over.

35
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,110
Why this place?

36
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,610
Dad always liked a full breakfast.

37
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,080
Hello? Chief Inspector
Vera Stanhope.

38
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,000
Vera?

39
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,220
Time of death?

40
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,190
Midnight, give or take...
God.

41
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,660
And again.

42
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,360
- Thanks, love.
- You're welcome.

43
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,620
When I find the bugger
who gave me this cold...

44
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,760
Pardon me.

45
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,500
Well, there's one
mystery cleared up.

46
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,090
Say hello to your wife
and kids for me, Billy.

47
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,610
How old is Jack now?

48
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,230
His name is Raymond.

49
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,420
So...

50
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,530
we've ruled out suicide?

51
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,840
Evidently.

52
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,150
Thin abrasion round the neck.

53
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,120
Strangled? A wire or what?

54
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,280
Skin's not broken, so unlikely.

55
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,230
Some kind of thin rope, I imagine.

56
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,550
So not drowned?

57
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,120
No, death was moments before
the body entered the water.

58
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,110
I'm speculating...somewhere in the
house.

59
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,890
Then carted in here and dropped in
the tub.

60
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,220
Not dropped.

61
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,910
Placed. Precision.

62
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,790
And those flowers?

63
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,360
Shop-bought...? Oh, no.

64
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,420
They're wild flowers, must be.

65
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,760
Meadow flowers.

66
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,390
- We'll need an expert.
- OK.

67
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,520
Nice-looking.

68
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,190
Luke Armstrong.

69
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:49,380
15 last April.

70
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,740
Almost look younger,

71
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,710
don't they, after...

72
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,090
OK, erm.... Home alone, the lad?

73
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,770
No. Laura, kid sister.

74
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,780
She was in there...

75
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,080
Right.

76
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,920
Entry? Our killer?

77
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,110
Kitchen window open, apparently.

78
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,180
That was usual, was it?

79
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,250
Leaving the window open?

80
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,880
Well, her daughter's asthmatic.

81
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,520
So...

82
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,830
the killer comes through the window.

83
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,430
- Prints?
- Partial footwear impression.

84
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,000
Must be some kind of walking boot?

85
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,710
Yeah, looks like it.

86
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,510
What about the girl?
She must have heard something.

87
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,990
Spark-out apparently.

88
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,450
Asleep? And we believe that?

89
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,360
Teenagers. Believe anything.

90
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,020
Should do nicely, for publicity.

91
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,550
I'll have a word.

92
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,310
And mum?

93
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,310
Where's mum?

94
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,540
I should phone the
school, should I?

95
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,090
- Is that what you do?
- It's all taken care of.

96
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,750
Right.

97
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,520
<i>Mind how you go there.</i>

98
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,880
I know he was down in
the dumps lately, but...

99
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,800
Julie,

100
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,660
your son...

101
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,990
didn't take his own life.

102
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,260
<i>OK. Ready to move the body.</i>

103
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,540
Right. Come on. Let's take
ourselves off for a bit.

104
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,950
Come on, pet.

105
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,320
I got home...

106
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,310
must have been 11:30.

107
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,820
Bus or taxi?

108
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,550
Yeah, it was a bus. Gary...

109
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,910
he works on the sound
desk at the Sage.

110
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,680
- Your fella?
- Aye.

111
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,150
Well, he had to get back and

112
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,510
help out after the show, so...

113
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,310
he left us at a taxi
rank at the Quayside.

114
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,880
I'm a bit short, to
tell you the truth.

115
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,530
I didn't want to seem like
I was begging for a handout,

116
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,320
so I waited till he
wasn't looking, then I...

117
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,820
- Ah, right. You got the bus instead.
- Aye.

118
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,650
Anything catch your
eye? Cars? Faces?

119
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,770
There was a jeep kind of thing
at the bottom of the street.

120
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,600
- Jeep?
- Yeah.

121
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,030
- You mean a Land Rover?
- Aye, that's it.

122
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,960
Colour?

123
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,920
Green...

124
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,770
brown maybe.

125
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,160
If I'd drunk a bit less,

126
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,720
kept a clear head, then maybe...

127
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,280
You said...

128
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,970
Luke had been a bit down lately.

129
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,140
Aye, well, he's... Luke's very...

130
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,560
He was...

131
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,810
very sensitive.

132
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,470
I know we always say
that, don't we, but he...

133
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,020
he was.

134
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,290
But why now in particular?

135
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,140
Well, his friend Tommy

136
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,680
drowned in the summer and
Luke, poor lad, saw it happen.

137
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,350
- Tommy Sharp?
- Aye. Aye.

138
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,480
I kept telling him,
'Son, it's not your fault.'

139
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,670
Do you think, if I'd just
waited for that taxi...

140
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:13,235
No. Don't do that.

141
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,590
20 quid from the Quayside to Blyth,
it's not even...

142
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,210
I don't deserve kids...

143
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,820
I don't.

144
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,580
My beautiful boy.

145
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,880
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh, God.

147
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,340
What happens now?

148
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,810
You try to get some rest.

149
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,710
If you remember anything at all,
you've got my number.

150
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,020
Aye.

151
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,860
What's he doing here?

152
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,350
Gary?

153
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,380
I'm so sorry.

154
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,980
- Hiya!
- Mum!

155
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,080
How are you? You all right?
Did you have a good day?

156
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,510
- Good?
- It was good.

157
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,060
- Did you get on well?
- I don't know.

158
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,240
- No, have you not decided yet?
- No.

159
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,310
You must be James's mum.

160
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,040
Hi. Yeah. Felicity. How you doing?

161
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,460
- I'm Lily Marsh.
- All right?

162
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,880
I'm James's new teacher.

163
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,840
- Oh, yeah.
- About the beach hut?

164
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,150
What about it?

165
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,250
- He did tell you, didn't he?
- What's that?

166
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,650
James, I don't believe you!

167
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,110
I'm sorry. It's just
we were talking in class

168
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,140
about where we all lived
and I happened to mention

169
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,450
I was in between digs, you know,

170
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,820
and James here pipes up and
says you were after a tenant.

171
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,590
You cheeky monkey.

172
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,650
Well, you know, I don't know.

173
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,250
You're not after a tenant, then?

174
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,900
Well, we have talked about
it, I suppose, you know. But...

175
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,520
I'm so sorry, I should
have called direct.

176
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,770
If I run. I might
still catch that bus.

177
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,080
No, no, listen, you know.

178
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,170
I expect we can fit you in
our busy schedule, can't we?

179
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,730
- Really?
- Jamie?

180
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,420
Come on!

181
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,750
Open up!

182
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,250
Jamie, the key's under the mat.

183
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,480
Here.

184
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,790
On the head.

185
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,120
Oh, sorry.

186
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,170
- It's very nice.
- It's peaceful, you know.

187
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,100
A lot of privacy if
that's what you're after.

188
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,280
So there's sitting...

189
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,620
area,

190
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,650
shower, fridge, all mod cons.

191
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,160
Thank you.

192
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,630
You're very kind,
letting me in like this.

193
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,480
You're welcome.

194
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,860
Beautiful flowers.

195
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,880
I always love roses, don't you?

196
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,090
OK. Rise and shine.

197
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,830
Holly, what were they?
Shop-bought or what?

198
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,310
Gathered by hand, according to
Forensics.

199
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,110
But I spoke to a botanist
at the uni an hour ago.

200
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,670
He's tied up for the rest of the
day,

201
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,630
but I described them over the
phone and he said that they were -

202
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,260
Wildflowers, found in every
ditch in Northumberland.

203
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,570
Basically, yeah.

204
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,630
15 years old.

205
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,710
He was targeted. Why?

206
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,460
Anything at all?

207
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,780
His head teacher said Luke

208
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,120
had learning difficulties.

209
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,550
Got behavioural reports
going back a year or two.

210
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,050
OK. He was bored. Bit lost.

211
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,180
Wrong postcode for dyslexia.

212
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,380
Dad's in his grave.

213
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,780
Mum's hanging off her hinges,
worships the bones of him.

214
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,640
And someone climbs in the window,

215
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,020
strangles our lad
with a length of rope,

216
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,570
and then places him in a warm tub

217
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,080
like some poncey
installation at the Baltic.

218
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,620
And then there's his
class mate. Tommy Sharp.

219
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,450
- Tommy Sharp.
- Davy's lad.

220
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,890
Oh, look. It woke up.

221
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,840
Tell 'em, Joe.

222
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,610
Tommy drowned four months back

223
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,790
whilst playing with
our victim by the sea.

224
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,140
Coroner's verdict: misadventure.

225
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,360
Now, no blame was attached to Luke.

226
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,950
They were class mates,
best friends apparently,

227
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,470
and according to one eyewitness

228
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,080
they were playing peacefully.

229
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,710
Tommy got carried out by the
current, Luke went in after him.

230
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,100
He was lucky not to drown himself.

231
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,020
Charlie, blag a copy of the coroner's
report.

232
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,660
- Will do.
- And then comes the memorial.

233
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,780
Same place as Tommy drowned... Joe.

234
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,540
Flowers on the water.

235
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,350
They're not wildflowers.

236
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,710
No, they look shop-bought to me.

237
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,020
So, are the flowers on Luke

238
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,270
some sort of homage
to this other lad?

239
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,160
Or revenge? Reprisal?

240
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,320
That's a question
I'm hoping to put...

241
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,550
..to this man.

242
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,740
It's Tommy's father. Davy Sharp.

243
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,510
Walked out of prison nine days ago.

244
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,490
Been off the radar ever since.

245
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,920
'Your characters...

246
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,710
"are more real...

247
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,360
"than anyone except...

248
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,670
"I suppose...

249
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,710
"Because, under...

250
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,160
"..made it kinder.
What was I thinking?

251
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,790
"He would count it a blessing...

252
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,910
"..if I fell under
a bus.

253
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,050
"But I will not go quietly."

254
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,300
Let me out!

255
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,700
Let me out of here!

256
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,260
Please! I can't breathe.

257
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,220
Help me!

258
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,260
Oh, Dad.

259
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,460
This is where he was spotted
the last couple of days.

260
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,920
Hello, Davy.

261
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,870
What you doing here?

262
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,360
Your family's worried sick.

263
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,710
This one of Tommy's
old haunts, is it?

264
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,650
His name was Thomas.

265
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,760
I need to talk to you

266
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,180
about your son's
friend, Luke Armstrong?

267
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,130
I'm afraid he died Thursday night.

268
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,950
Murdered in his own bed.
What do you think of that?

269
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,090
- How did they kill him?
- A length of rope.

270
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,080
You were angry with Luke
for your son's death.

271
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,480
It's all in the report.

272
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,410
Thomas Sharp slipped
and fell in the water.

273
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,050
His best friend Luke
tried to save him,

274
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,180
but he drowned anyway.

275
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,560
Still... Life goes on, eh?

276
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,250
A neighbour just told my sergeant

277
00:20:52,655 --> 00:20:55,650
that you were seen
spying on Luke's house.

278
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,930
He never told his mother, like you.

279
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,990
He didn't want to frighten her.

280
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,730
What were you
following him for, Davy?

281
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,040
I wanted to hear him say
that he tried his best.

282
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,450
Ma'am.

283
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,480
Hey! Don't you touch that.

284
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,770
What were you doing
on Thursday night?

285
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,420
- Thursday?
- Anyone see you?

286
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,810
- Vouch for you?
- Hey! Get your hands off that!

287
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,970
Don't you touch that.
I want yous out of here!

288
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,430
I want yous out now!
Get out!

289
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,750
You'd better arrest him, Joe.

290
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,980
He could do with a decent meal.

291
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,760
There we go.

292
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,380
I think it's a ring ouzel.

293
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,290
It's a blackbird.

294
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,310
Ring number 64.

295
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,680
Full female.

296
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,520
128.

297
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,280
There you go.

298
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,310
- Cheers!
- Never.

299
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,760
No, it's true. One year to go.

300
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,210
It's not like it's a trade secret.

301
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,520
Right...

302
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,510
- What do you think, Jim?
- It's brilliant.

303
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,860
It's not just any clock.

304
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,340
You've got to wind
it up to the hour...

305
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,360
- Gary's idea.
- I can see that.

306
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,490
Chaffinch. Chaffinch?

307
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,800
Song thrush.

308
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,670
Well, that is...

309
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,090
And every hour
it's a different garden bird.

310
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,290
- ..obscene.
- Just what you always wanted.

311
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,760
Peter?

312
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,940
It's not much. It's...

313
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,540
It's a paper bag. Very promising.

314
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,880
Did you do this?

315
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,220
We all look half our age!

316
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,360
Well, we were.
It's from an old Polaroid.

317
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,110
It's our first ever trip. Do you
remember?

318
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,710
- Up in Skye.
- Yeah.

319
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,030
Skye.

320
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,230
Thank you, Clive.
Where do we hang it?

321
00:23:19,255 --> 00:23:21,730
It's a shoo-in for
the outdoor khazi.

322
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,260
- Very funny.
- He's just jealous.

323
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,890
Oi, where are you sneaking off to?

324
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,690
- Nowhere.
- I'll come with you if you like.

325
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,280
No, Gary, you stay put.
Don't go too far, my love.

326
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,760
Mum!

327
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,880
Dad!

328
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,980
Mum!

329
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,260
That's our eyewitness.

330
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,160
James Calvert, aged nine.

331
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,410
One for you, I think.

332
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,270
Lily Marsh was his teacher.

333
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,520
- What?
- At the local school in Hepworth.

334
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,540
She ever teach Luke Armstrong?

335
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,640
There's no chance. She
was only there six weeks.

336
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,520
Part of her training, apparently.

337
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,340
What the...

338
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,920
Hey!

339
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,620
Get off! Which one
of you dozy dickwipes

340
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,400
came up with this brave notion?

341
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,570
Nobody touches the body
till Forensics get here.

342
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,990
That's what they said.

343
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,790
Get Billy Cartwright on the phone.
Now!

344
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,000
Better?

345
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,320
Now, that is moist.

346
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,460
Aren't you clever!

347
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,120
Thanks.

348
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,720
That was a stroke of luck for us,

349
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,330
your lad chancing on the victim.

350
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,210
It's one way of
putting it, I suppose.

351
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,100
One more hour,
she'd have been swept out to sea.

352
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,410
Yeah.

353
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,880
Mind you, the boys were going
to walk up to the castle, so...

354
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,120
I suppose someone would have seen
her.

355
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:02,210
- How is he?
- Just gone down.

356
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,520
Really?

357
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,810
- My little boy.
- He'll be OK.

358
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,540
A thing like this, though, you just
don't know what goes in, do you?

359
00:26:10,095 --> 00:26:11,720
Jamie adored her.

360
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,390
I saw her, you know.
She was here yesterday.

361
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,200
- You never said.
- Yeah.

362
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,610
She'd heard about the beach hut

363
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,190
and she came to the house.

364
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,950
I was waiting to hear from her.

365
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,440
- I'm going to go and see him.
- Sweetheart, he'll be fine.

366
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,750
I'll just be a minute.

367
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,070
Dr. Calvert...

368
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,880
You ever meet the victim?
Through the university, perhaps?

369
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,470
I'm Botany.

370
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,210
Wrong end of campus.

371
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,110
I think your sergeant
said she was

372
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,290
studying English, wasn't she?

373
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,200
What a thing.

374
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,950
There's still time to
go down to the castle...

375
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,110
- ..if we're all done here.
- That's not really on, is it?

376
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,820
No?

377
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,040
Sorry.

378
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,710
So, just to be clear none of you,

379
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,040
gentlemen, had ever met the victim?

380
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,880
Gary's the lady's man.

381
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,090
He's joking.

382
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,940
I thought I knew
your face.

383
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,970
Yesterday morning you
were waiting outside

384
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,340
Julie Armstrong's house.

385
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,630
Yeah?

386
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,370
What time did you get up here?

387
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,710
Today?

388
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:33,790
It'd be about two o'clock,
was it?

389
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,210
I've been at work all morning.

390
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,480
So, what? I mean...

391
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,160
You work at the Sage
Gateshead,don't you?

392
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,450
That's right. I was
devastated about her boy.

393
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:48,650
She's none too bright herself.

394
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,080
That one yours, is it, sir?

395
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,960
Yeah, how did you know?

396
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,480
Mind if my lads have a nose inside?

397
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,080
No, if it helps.

398
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,660
- Thursday night.
- What?

399
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,730
You spent the evening with Julie.

400
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,680
Then dropped her at the taxi rank.

401
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,440
Aye, yeah. I fancied a walk.

402
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,480
She was under the impression
you had to get back to work.

403
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,010
Was she?

404
00:28:17,975 --> 00:28:19,450
No, no, I...

405
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,180
It was a big night. It was a lot to
take in.

406
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,650
I just needed to clear my head.

407
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,700
21 years of age, no kids yet.

408
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,940
She had all that ahead of her.
A waste, don't you think?

409
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,440
So, she was in the water,
what...?

410
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,580
A minimum two hours, but she passed
her last breath earlier still.

411
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:53,550
- When?
- 10, 10:30 yesterday morning.

412
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,210
She died elsewhere.

413
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,810
I imagine she was dragged. See?

414
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,490
Same as Luke.

415
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,520
Carried over the rocks
from the car park?

416
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,930
A strong fella.

417
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,090
But the last sighting
of her was 10:30?

418
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,400
Yeah. The night before, leaving

419
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,370
the Crown Posada in
the centre of town.

420
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,390
What happened to her overnight?

421
00:29:11,495 --> 00:29:12,850
She may have been confined.

422
00:29:13,692 --> 00:29:15,860
Incarcerated. Any idea where?

423
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,560
I found paint flakes
under the nails.

424
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,180
Could be the boot
of a car.

425
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,490
Land Rover?

426
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,080
Couldn't say.

427
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,410
- Same killer?
- Same murder weapon.

428
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,780
Or similar. A thin rope.

429
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,520
You recall these contusions
round the victim's neck?

430
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,320
And flowers? Those we could save.

431
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,130
Heather, thrift, rock rose.

432
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,830
Again, picked not shop-bought.

433
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,350
- A match?
- Yeah.

434
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,390
- I suppose that rules out Davy Sharp.
- For this poor lass.

435
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,010
He was with you, wasn't he?

436
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,790
Not that I want to tell
you your job, but...

437
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,710
Good for you.

438
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,320
Somebody make some
sense of this. Joe?

439
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,910
A teenage boy, trainee teacher...

440
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,850
never met. Never spoke,
as far as we know.

441
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,190
Both nice-looking, blonde.

442
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,090
I don't suppose there was any...

443
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,950
you know, interfering.

444
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,210
Sergeant, you're a gentleman.
No, no sign of sexual assault.

445
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,910
Although,

446
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,130
I imagine the young lady was...

447
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,290
dressing up for someone.

448
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,420
He's off in a hurry, isn't he?

449
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,190
Now here's Julie...

450
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,010
..pretending to get a taxi.

451
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,810
A couple of drunks.

452
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,590
Should be ashamed of themselves.

453
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,450
Here's Gary, minding
his own business.

454
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,700
Here he comes.

455
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,340
Now he's running. He's in a hurry.

456
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,240
Why he's such a hurry?

457
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,470
Now, where are you going?

458
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,170
As far as Gary knew,
she was getting a taxi.

459
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,560
I mean, how was he to know she
was getting the slow bus home?

460
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,530
He texted her twice
on the way of home

461
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,880
asking her not how she
was, but where she was.

462
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,860
What's this? Are
you pulling a sickie?

463
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:35,090
I'm on leave. I'm supposed to be.

464
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,680
The head's engaged.
We're not even packed yet.

465
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,610
For the hospital.

466
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,040
Plus the mother-in-law's
turning up

467
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,370
at five with a case
full of ravioli.

468
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,680
Lucky old you.

469
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,980
Look at that.

470
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,310
I think they're waving at you.

471
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,650
Come and say hello.
They won't bite.

472
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,490
Another time, perhaps.
I've got that much paperwork to do.

473
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,220
More interviews. An all-nighter
I expect. You go on. Go.

474
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,040
You make the most
of your family time.

475
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,950
Listen, I could send
them to the cinema.

476
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,520
- We've two hours, max.
- Well, if you think

477
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,360
you could manage it, pet...

478
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,760
Here.

479
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,190
- What's that?
- For the cinema. Take it.

480
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,010
You're very kind.

481
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,880
That wouldn't even buy
the popcorn.

482
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,490
What's this got to do with Gary?

483
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,980
Probably nothing at all.

484
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,810
You shouldn't do that.

485
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,680
You shouldn't put thoughts
like that into my head.

486
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,080
Gary is a good man.

487
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,910
This lass,

488
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,090
- have you ever seen her before?
- No.

489
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,390
No, I haven't.

490
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,850
Laura?

491
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,540
- Who is she?
- Is she familiar at all?

492
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,160
I almost forgot. This letter came.

493
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,600
Here.

494
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,940
Condolence?

495
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,040
No, it's addressed
to our Luke. See?

496
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,610
They've got the
address wrong, you see.

497
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,680
20 Alba Street instead
of 20 Alba Terrace.

498
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,420
When did it come?

499
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,810
It was yesterday I think. Was it?

500
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,420
What do you think?

501
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,080
Innocent enough.

502
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,210
How much rent was she paying?

503
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,990
£580 a month.

504
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,540
Steep for a trainee teacher.

505
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,850
Posh end of town.

506
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,010
And she was moving out, was she?

507
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,840
Not according to the flatmate.

508
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,340
But she was behind with
her rent, apparently.

509
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,470
So why the sudden urge to move

510
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,410
into the Calverts' beach hut...

511
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,770
..the day before she died?

512
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,580
Listen, not much longer.
We're just finishing up here.

513
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,550
OK, head off. Enjoy your half
day.

514
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,170
- You're very kind.
- I know.

515
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,980
Yeah, just one or two things...

516
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,100
He's local.

517
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,780
It's unsealed, so there's
no trace of saliva.

518
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,590
Smart-arse.

519
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,950
Same as Luke's.

520
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,620
Two down.

521
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,680
Who's next?

522
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,300
Ma'am?

523
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,010
I thought I knew his name.

524
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,350
Samuel Parr, local author,
one of the birdwatchers.

525
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,480
Hi, is Julie there?

526
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,380
Julie?

527
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,260
It's Gary.

528
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,290
Sorry?

529
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,050
Yeah, can you put her on?

530
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,590
I just said, didn't I? She
can't come to the phone now. Bye.

531
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,110
Thanks, love.

532
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,020
Thank you.

533
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,740
Did you write this?

534
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,260
Shop signing.

535
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,120
It's how we shift books these days.

536
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,580
Standard issue. Total bollocks.

537
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,640
Yeah, the ideal reader is
one who leaves you alone.

538
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,190
'Keep in touch'?

539
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,360
Hang on.

540
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,270
There's an outside chance
she's in here somewhere.

541
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,070
It's fan mail.

542
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,780
Daft as it may seem.

543
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,860
I don't know what
they expect from me.

544
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,140
Lily...?

545
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,630
Marsh.

546
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,510
Are you sure you've never met her?

547
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,040
She's not my sort at all, if
that's what you're getting at.

548
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,690
Then how do we like
our women, Mr. Parr?

549
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,490
You'd be surprised.

550
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,960
These letters...

551
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,690
..you ever write back?

552
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,510
Seldom even read
them, to be honest.

553
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,260
You're not tempted,
all that devotion?

554
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,020
My vanity is more specific.

555
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,850
Certain people, certain times.

556
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,990
This the wife?

557
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,420
Late wife.

558
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,580
Sorry.

559
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,060
That's OK.

560
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,750
Paid to snoop.

561
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,340
Here we go.

562
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,780
Anything good?

563
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,840
I've yet to see them fully clothed.

564
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,860
I thought you told
us they were farmers.

565
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,640
That's what my dad said.

566
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,150
Poor sod.

567
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,810
Probably couldn't bring
himself to utter the truth.

568
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:12,100
Nothing he hated worse
than being laughed at.

569
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,880
Where did he...?

570
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,440
Where did he what? Cook?
Clean? Wash his knickers? What?

571
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,560
Where did he die?

572
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,320
In that chair.

573
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,550
I'm joking.

574
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,680
First landing.

575
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,880
Who found him?

576
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,620
Nobody.

577
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,480
Listen, you're not serious about
wanting to move up here, are you?

578
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,210
He's only been gone two minutes.

579
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,760
Six weeks.

580
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,390
All it wants is just
a bit of tidying up.

581
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,240
Speaking of which, come here.

582
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,880
There's an evil smell, and I
can't get the bloody door open.

583
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,000
So you want me to have a look?

584
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,680
Well, seeing as you're here.

585
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,990
There's two kinds of birdwatcher,
Joe.

586
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:42,040
One lot, ganning
about with their pagers

587
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,790
and their funny little lists,

588
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,040
along comes a bird,
not even a rare bird...

589
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,740
You see 'em out on
the hard shoulder,

590
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:53,530
bins out, mouths open,
dead to the world.

591
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,670
The other lot...

592
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,340
Dad's lot,

593
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,950
dragging me out of
bed seven years old,

594
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,260
half asleep in the back of the car

595
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,180
while he's up a tree

596
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,260
stealing eggs off some raptor.

597
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,880
It was never enough just to
look. He had to tear it apart,

598
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,310
see how it worked.

599
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,920
He was a bully.

600
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,710
Or maybe he was just scared.

601
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,270
Scared of dying alone in a big empty
house.

602
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,850
Did you get a chance to say goodbye?

603
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,680
I don't think goodbye
would have covered it.

604
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,260
What's that?

605
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,510
Mist net.

606
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,180
It's what they use to trap migrant
birds.

607
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,580
Take it up to the lab, will you?

608
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,750
- A murder weapon?
- It's standard equipment.

609
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,380
Still, there's no harm in asking.

610
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,820
So we're back onto those witnesses,

611
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,620
Peter Calvert and his groupies?

612
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,740
This is not some pet prejudice.

613
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,470
She was put in that rock pool

614
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,780
for them to find.

615
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,320
I'm sure of it.

616
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,020
What?

617
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,260
I'm just saying...

618
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,500
it's the first murder
since your dad passed away,

619
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,740
and it's all about birdwatching.

620
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,640
Maybe it is about birdwatching.

621
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,460
What?

622
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,160
That was quick.

623
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,270
No, hold on, I'll come with you.

624
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,410
Smart girl, Holly.

625
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,650
Hard work and an open mind.

626
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,780
I was just the same
when I was her age.

627
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,810
Right. Course you were.

628
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,660
Mr. Craven's a... What is it?

629
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,960
A psychiatric social worker.

630
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,620
She was the most beautiful
girl I'd ever seen.

631
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,410
So why dump her, Mr. Craven?

632
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,100
Well, too much, too young.

633
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,630
Plus, I needed to
focus on my A-levels.

634
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,170
So I pulled the plug.
I tried to, anyway.

635
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,230
Lily went off at the deep end.
There was letters, e-mails.

636
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,240
She scared me half to
death, to be honest.

637
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,520
She was obviously having
some kind of breakdown.

638
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,440
I think she was even
in here for a spell.

639
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,080
These corridors
must be teeming

640
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,220
with your cast-offs, Mr. Craven?

641
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,710
- Not really.
- Friday night.

642
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,990
Can you account for
your whereabouts?

643
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,640
- Friday...
- Oh, erm... I checked.

644
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,950
He was here all night and

645
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,550
the next morning,
weren't you, Mr. Craven?

646
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,420
So Lily was obsessive,

647
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,680
clingy. That's got to be useful.

648
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,510
- Take a look at these.
- What are they?

649
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,210
Letters. Lily Marsh to Samuel Parr.

650
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,570
I can't think why. He's no Tom
Clancy.

651
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,100
She seems to have been seeing someone

652
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,460
up to a couple of weeks ago,
an older man.

653
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,290
- OK.
- And get Charlie

654
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,400
to chase up how she was
paying the rent, will you?

655
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,460
This boy friend, you're
thinking sugar daddy?

656
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,280
Yeah, it would make sense.

657
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,060
Have you got any
ideas who he is, ma'am?

658
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,190
I'm drawing up a shortlist.

659
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,980
OK.

660
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,180
What's Joe up to today?

661
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,580
Sin bin.

662
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,210
Keeps him sharp.

663
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,500
Joe.

664
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,690
And there, sir. Right, cheers.

665
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,970
Registered to a Mr.
and Mrs Blakeworth.

666
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,580
Unlikely suspects,
seeing as they got back

667
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,010
from Tenerife two hours ago.

668
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:30,010
- Prints? Forensics?
- No, no prints.

669
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,540
Paint flakes in the boot.

670
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,770
Lily Marsh, was she in the boot?

671
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,570
It's not confirmed,
but it looks like.

672
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,080
And?

673
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:38,690
They found this,
back seat.

674
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,840
Mist net.

675
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,050
Item: One stolen Land Rover.

676
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,400
- Mist net.
- Possible match for weapon.

677
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:01,380
Ruling in our confederacy
of birdwatchers.

678
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,060
Lily Marsh.
Where are we at with the older man?

679
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,090
There's no names in the letters to
Samuel Parr,

680
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,040
but she talks about him in the first
letter.

681
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,500
- 'Generous and kind,' she says.
- Dated?

682
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,700
Six months back, April 17th.

683
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,300
Two weeks later she's in the posh
flat.

684
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,750
Joe. Money?

685
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,370
There's between 400 and 600 quid

686
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,980
going into her account every month.

687
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,950
Cash deposits, before you ask.

688
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,510
The last one was
£300, six weeks ago.

689
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,820
Six?

690
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,030
So older man ends it.

691
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,110
Or tries to.

692
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,890
And we know Lily didn't
take kindly to being dumped.

693
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:41,490
What else in those letters?
Any mention of Luke Armstrong?

694
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,800
No.

695
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,810
So what's the link?

696
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,880
Luke and Lily. Anybody?
Daft as you like.

697
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,190
Gary Wright?

698
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,610
We've already ruled
out his Land Rover.

699
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,360
- Aye, but he loves the women.
- Who doesn't?

700
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,980
Maybe he's at it with Lily.

701
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,040
He moves on to Julie.

702
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,970
Lily wouldn't let go.

703
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,990
What, so he murders her?

704
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,640
Heather.

705
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,770
Autumn hawkbit.

706
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,940
A bit of wild sorrel.

707
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,420
Nothing you can pin down
to a particular place?

708
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:20,790
No,

709
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,610
pretty bog-standard
this time of year.

710
00:45:23,062 --> 00:45:25,440
There's no significance
you can see?

711
00:45:26,175 --> 00:45:27,475
As in?

712
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,080
Well, the choice of flowers,
the arrangement?

713
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,400
It seems like...

714
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,330
they're laid out...

715
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,170
for taste more than anything else.

716
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,610
Taste?

717
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:42,030
Yes, presentation.
The look of the thing.

718
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,550
I see.

719
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,850
You'd need to ask Felicity.
She's the real gardener.

720
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,020
Good for you.

721
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,350
A strong marriage.

722
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,250
Those friends of yours
must be dead jealous.

723
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,210
Hardly. I'm forever
farming her out.

724
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,260
She reads all Sam's stories,

725
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,430
and dishes out tea and sympathy

726
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:05,840
when Gary's latest
love affairs go south.

727
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,680
I expect Gary has the pick of
them, does he? His line of work?

728
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,450
I don't think it's half
as glamorous as that.

729
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,690
Look, I really must get started.

730
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,550
Is this what you call a full house?

731
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,760
These days, yes.

732
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,580
Right...

733
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,870
- She sent you alone?
- Aye, just the once.

734
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,300
Let me guess.
Issues around delegation?

735
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,270
You know that thing she
does? The country hick thing.

736
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,940
Doesn't fool me.

737
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,920
Had Peter fooled, though.

738
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:01,410
He's no fool in that picture.

739
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,000
No.

740
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:06,810
Look how his eyes follow
me around the room.

741
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,250
They do, don't they?

742
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,760
As if rebuking me for my
idle thoughts. (CHUCKLES)

743
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,705
- That's Clive for you.
- Clive?

744
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,630
Artist, stray dog, son that
never was.

745
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,010
Mind you, Gary's no better.

746
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,490
He's a bit rock'n'roll,
is he, Gary?

747
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,710
It's one way of putting it.

748
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,370
They both sulked for
years when I showed up.

749
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,940
And what about Samuel Parr?

750
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:35,670
Sam?

751
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,850
Sam's a bit more normal.

752
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,400
So,

753
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:42,710
Detective Sergeant,

754
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,560
what can I do you for?

755
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,160
The young woman who died, who was
interested in your beach hut.

756
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,950
I don't know, that was
just a mix-up, I think.

757
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,910
She said that Jamie, my son, had...

758
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,220
How's he doing?

759
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,940
- He's getting there.
- Good.

760
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,450
Thanks.

761
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,660
You see, the thing is, that er...

762
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,540
There's no evidence she planned

763
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,850
to quit her flat,

764
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,810
so I wondered if you thought she
was ever really serious at all?

765
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,790
- About?
- Moving up here.

766
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,680
Not especially.

767
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,790
No, I don't.
In fact, I almost wonder

768
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,030
if she was just checking us out.

769
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,080
Maybe she'd had a
row with her boyfriend

770
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,160
or flatmate or...

771
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:28,890
I don't know.

772
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,190
- Well?
- Well, what?

773
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,790
- Did she ravish you?
- Oh, just the once.

774
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,050
She had some interesting
things to say about you.

775
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,890
Mr. Stringer, how are you?

776
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,440
You certainly put
the wind up Peter.

777
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:49,750
Called ahead, did he?

778
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,350
Just now. I shouldn't mock,
should I?

779
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,170
Good friends, you and Dr. Calvert?

780
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,680
The best. And Felicity.

781
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,280
Point of fact, these past months...

782
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,620
Well, my mother, you see,

783
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,580
she's been under the same roof...

784
00:49:05,835 --> 00:49:07,450
well, all my life.

785
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,770
- She's not been well?
- She forgets.

786
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,380
You go on making
excuses for them, then...

787
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,970
I wake up, middle of the night,

788
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:19,100
3:08 it was, front door wide open,

789
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:21,160
frost on the windscreen,

790
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:22,970
and I finally track her down.

791
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,330
83 years old.

792
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:27,540
She's waltzing up the central
reservation in her night-dress.

793
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,550
- Nightmare.
- And Felicity

794
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,950
drove me round all the homes.

795
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:33,510
And she gave me the courage

796
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,640
to see I wasn't
letting anyone down.

797
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,120
So it's just yourself now,
then, is it, Mr. Stringer?

798
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:42,560
Well, I've been keepping over

799
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:46,360
at Peter and Felicity's when
I'm not staying at Sam's.

800
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:52,290
I find to my horror that I'm...

801
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,530
I'm not much good
at living alone.

802
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:57,180
I-I know. Certifiable these days.

803
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:58,590
Hardly.

804
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:00,850
You too?

805
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,160
It's not for the
faint-hearted, is it?

806
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,470
No. No, it's not.

807
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:08,430
How about Gary Wright?

808
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,420
You're not tempted
to sleep on his sofa?

809
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,260
The state of his flat?

810
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,070
My immune system couldn't
take the beating. Besides...

811
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,260
Well, it's like Clapham
Junction in there.

812
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,690
- Blondes, brunettes, redheads.
- Oh, lucky fella.

813
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,630
Are you sure you've
never seen her before?

814
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:37,080
Gary didn't take her home,
maybe from a club or...?

815
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,250
I don't think so.

816
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,460
Would you tell me if he had?

817
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,060
Why are you bothering with all this.
We were just witnesses.

818
00:50:45,495 --> 00:50:46,795
How about...

819
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:49,860
Luke Armstrong?

820
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,280
That one...

821
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:59,520
Thomas Sharp. A waste of a life.

822
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,670
He grew up round
the corner from us.

823
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,490
We didn't think much of the family.

824
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,540
Mum had the police out a couple

825
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,280
of times on account of
all the noise, but...

826
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:09,710
Thomas was canny enough.

827
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,100
- Where will you go?
- Wherever the wind takes me.

828
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,540
Davy, this anger you've got,

829
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,540
it's not the only way
of keeping hold of him.

830
00:51:23,015 --> 00:51:25,820
I will not believe that
Thomas just fell in the water.

831
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:28,110
- He had a father who loved him...
- Don't.

832
00:51:28,832 --> 00:51:30,720
Don't think you can just fix it.

833
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,190
- I can't see straight without him.
- No, I know. I know that.

834
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,300
I open my eyes, and
it's all black and white.

835
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,780
Like one of his bloody pictures.

836
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,640
Go on.

837
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,560
I'm not eating that.

838
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,390
- It's off.
- Suit yourself.

839
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,330
Off, my arse.

840
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,660
Don't fall for the big lie.

841
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,030
These cakes will last
for weeks. Hold that.

842
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:24,610
- You're mad, you are.
- Not mad, I'm cheap.

843
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,030
- I love these.
- Yeah?

844
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,390
I'm told Thomas was
never without his camera.

845
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,920
Only none of his family
seem to know where it is.

846
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,630
I hate having my photograph taken.

847
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:50,200
I always look so clumsy, somehow.

848
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,770
Me too.

849
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,810
You look very relaxed here.

850
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,130
And here.

851
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,230
Thomas put you at
your ease, did he?

852
00:52:59,575 --> 00:53:00,875
I suppose.

853
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,690
You were very close,
you and Thomas?

854
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,120
Yeah.

855
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,000
Do you miss him?

856
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,440
Yeah.

857
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:25,060
- Your mum know about the pair of you?
- No.

858
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,250
Please...

859
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,350
We only did it the once,

860
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,360
please don't tell her.

861
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,340
None of my business.

862
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,660
I really need to find
that camera, though.

863
00:53:41,095 --> 00:53:43,910
- I haven't got it.
- But you know where it is.

864
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,770
They had a fight.

865
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,650
A fight? Thomas and your brother?

866
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,520
Yeah.

867
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,770
The camera went in the water.

868
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:58,020
And Thomas...
jumped in after it?

869
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:01,470
So that's how he drowned!

870
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:05,080
- Trying to save his camera?
- That's what Luke said.

871
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,020
He made me swear not to tell

872
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,110
or he'd blab to Mum.

873
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:10,890
About you and Thomas?

874
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,690
What were they fighting about?

875
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,730
Luke wouldn't say,

876
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,530
but...

877
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,280
Go on.

878
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,450
All I know is, Thomas showed
me these pictures on his camera

879
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,310
a few weeks before he drowned.

880
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,740
There was this couple,

881
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,740
you know...

882
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,150
So he'd been peeping,

883
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,570
had he, with his camera?

884
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,380
Every Friday afternoon.

885
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:46,290
He was laughing,
like it was so funny.

886
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:48,510
And he said, did I
want to come and watch?

887
00:54:49,295 --> 00:54:51,780
He said he had a plan.

888
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,580
'A bit of a laugh', he said.

889
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,290
- What kind of laugh?
- I don't know.

890
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,990
And did you...go with him?

891
00:54:59,355 --> 00:55:01,280
I'm not a pervert.

892
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,540
This couple, in the photographs,

893
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:08,090
did you recognise them?

894
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,210
She was really pretty.

895
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,790
Lily Marsh?

896
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,160
Maybe, yeah.

897
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,260
Lily Marsh in the
photograph? Are you sure?

898
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,010
Well, I think so.

899
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,370
Her mouth, you know.

900
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,120
And what about the man with her?

901
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,650
- I'd never saw him before.
- Old or young?

902
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,250
Old?

903
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,450
I-I don't know.

904
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,520
The photos were all blurry.

905
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:45,110
Blurry?

906
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:54,810
Can you stop...?

907
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,470
Can you stop the bus, please, mate?

908
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,320
Thanks.

909
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,890
So maybe that's why
they were fighting,

910
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:10,010
- the day Thomas drowned...
- Well, I don't know, do I?

911
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,660
I've worn you out, haven't I?

912
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,390
- I keep thinking...
- About...?

913
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:21,830
Yeah.

914
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,130
In your home?

915
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,080
Yeah.

916
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,840
I keep thinking that
if I close my eyes...

917
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:31,150
Right.

918
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:34,400
My own daughter's next
in line, is she? Come on.

919
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,190
- Go on, pet.
- Come on.

920
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,120
Nothing's clean, is it?

921
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,860
Everybody's tainted.

922
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,790
I'd hate to be you.

923
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:44,370
I'd hate to be
trapped in your skin.

924
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,760
You're poison.

925
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,590
I need that camera!

926
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,550
You're hardly going to find
it here. It's been months.

927
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,120
It'll be halfway to Denmark by now.

928
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:05,990
It's our best link yet,
Lily Marsh in those pictures.

929
00:57:06,455 --> 00:57:09,710
The two boys, Luke and
Thomas, behind the lens.

930
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:14,350
Lily Marsh and the older man
out here, somewhere, "al fresco".

931
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,430
Hi, Joe, it's me. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Desk jockey.

932
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,300
I'm just checking
what we're looking for.

933
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:35,980
Black SLR zoom lens, right?

934
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:37,640
Guess what I'm looking at.

935
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,140
Found 12 weeks back by
a Mr. J Edwards in Blyth

936
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:43,160
and it's been sat in
Lost Property ever since.

937
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,780
You trust me?

938
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,560
Don't you?

939
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,350
Is this the same model as Thomas's?

940
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,180
Be careful with it.

941
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:20,390
Forensics want it back tip-top.

942
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,420
- What's up with you?
- It's Wednesday, isn't it?

943
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:27,530
Wednesday. The due date?
For the baby?

944
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,070
You know, I was there for
Michael, but I missed Jessie.

945
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,040
It's just nice to be
around, be... you know.

946
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,580
I tell you why
it's blurry.

947
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,600
At the end of the zoom,

948
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:27,740
no matter how firm you hold it,

949
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:30,240
the image starts to shake. Right?

950
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:35,110
So, if Thomas was crouching here...

951
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,930
Let's have a little look.

952
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,220
- Mum!
- She's off gallivanting.

953
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:59,290
Bye, Gran.

954
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,980
When you showed Lily round,

955
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:39,080
did you get the impression it was
the first time she'd been there?

956
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,490
- How do you mean?
- Did it seem familiar to her?

957
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:42,810
How would that be possible?

958
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:45,090
What do you do on
Friday afternoons?

959
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:47,310
- I beg your pardon?
- Do you have a regular appointment?

960
01:01:48,072 --> 01:01:51,270
Yes, I do. I teach
art, Hepworth library.

961
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,670
- What? What does it matter?
- I need your permission

962
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,290
to search the beach hut. I
want everything cordoned off,

963
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,110
- the whole site.
- Of course.

964
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,470
- But why?
- Where's your husband now, Mrs. Calvert?

965
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,350
At work. I don't know, he's, he's...

966
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:05,350
Left at the crack of dawn, and...

967
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,900
Why...why do you need to know?

968
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:11,110
We think there's a small chance
it's where Lily Marsh died.

969
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:20,960
Come in.

970
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,890
It's probably nothing at
all, but you did say...

971
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:25,720
Anything at all.

972
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,020
Can I just say,

973
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:31,100
I feel so stupid,
yelling at you like that.

974
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,990
I had it coming.

975
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,140
Sometimes I just get
lost in the chase.

976
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,860
You should hear 'em at work.

977
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,510
They think I was raised by wolves.

978
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,150
- Here it is.
- Don't touch it!

979
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:45,650
Sorry.

980
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:49,650
Seem to spend half
my life wearing these.

981
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,050
Not very fetching, are they?

982
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:56,660
- When did it come?
- This morning, I think.

983
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,020
Just some silly prank.

984
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,410
Did you call Laura on her mobile?

985
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,020
It's switched off.

986
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:16,850
But she got off to
school all right?

987
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:21,180
Yes. Well...

988
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:23,930
I-I think so. I...

989
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,540
I erm...I only got
back half an hour ago.

990
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:30,820
You stayed the night at Gary's?

991
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,060
Yes.

992
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,780
And... does Laura...

993
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:37,250
- take the school bus?
- Aye.

994
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,410
That's good, that's good.

995
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:44,070
We'll just call, make doubly sure.

996
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:46,430
I told you, her
phone's switched off.

997
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:49,720
- No, the school. Have you got the number?
- Right. Sorry.

998
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:51,510
Yeah, it's programmed on the phone.

999
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:55,620
She's forgotten her inhaler.

1000
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,930
We've got another card,

1001
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:08,910
addressed to Laura Armstrong.

1002
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,770
And she's missing, Joe. Didn't
turn up for school this morning.

1003
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,070
Get yourself down there,
talk to the school friends.

1004
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:20,620
If we're lucky, she may have
taken herself off to the shops.

1005
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,750
And get Calvert in for questioning.

1006
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,100
A 14-year-old
girl appears

1007
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:30,820
to have been abducted this morning,

1008
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,780
our last circumstantial
witness to the fact

1009
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:36,440
that Lily Marsh and an older man

1010
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:38,570
had sex in your beach hut

1011
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,220
every Friday afternoon

1012
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:42,140
while your wife was away at her art
club.

1013
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:44,910
- This is insanity.
- So, this morning?

1014
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,500
I told you,

1015
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:50,090
I drove to the campus at
eight, opened up the department.

1016
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:53,880
I'm a key holder. It's on the bloody
roster!

1017
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:56,840
Do you consider yourself an important
man?

1018
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,990
A successful man, Dr. Calvert?

1019
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:03,320
-  What kind of a question...?
- I Googled you.

1020
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,550
Height of impertinence, really.

1021
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,200
'Made a notable contribution

1022
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:11,550
'to British botanical
studies in the '80s,

1023
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,370
'but more recent work

1024
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:16,040
'is generally regarded
as a consolidation.'

1025
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:18,150
Now I'm guessing...

1026
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,760
that's bad, is it?

1027
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:21,070
The consolidation?

1028
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,490
Three cheers for the early promise,

1029
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:28,650
but, oh, all those half-empty
lecture halls,

1030
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,810
bored skinny girls texting

1031
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:32,120
their boyfriends.

1032
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,290
- You gonna just sit there?
- Was it standing room only,

1033
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,600
he was back in the day?

1034
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:37,510
Remind you, my client is
here of his own volition!

1035
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,010
And along comes Lily.

1036
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:43,310
Oh, I bet you were
more than flattered.

1037
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,600
- What nearly-man wouldn't be?
- OK. We're done here.

1038
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:48,760
We'll be in touch.

1039
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:53,480
Interview terminated 11:05.

1040
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,770
It's only her second
day back at school.

1041
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,690
Maybe the sight of all
her friends all at once,

1042
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,840
maybe she couldn't
face it,

1043
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,990
and thought, 'I'll go for a walk'.

1044
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:07,050
- You think that's possible?
- Until we learn more,

1045
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,560
I think there's every chance.

1046
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,260
And when she gets back, she's
gonna want you there on duty.

1047
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:14,690
- No excuses.
- You are going to find her, aren't you?

1048
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,980
Julie, you remember I showed you
a photograph of a young woman?

1049
01:06:26,895 --> 01:06:28,880
- On Sunday I showed you...
- Yes, yes.

1050
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,480
Well, we believe she
was having a relationship

1051
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,170
with a married man, an older man...

1052
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,630
..and that your son

1053
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,310
and Tommy Sharp witnessed
them and took photographs.

1054
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,750
Laura saw those photographs.

1055
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,380
Now,

1056
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:49,790
we think...

1057
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:52,150
the boys approached this man...

1058
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,540
I'm sorry, it's a lot to take in,

1059
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:57,930
but if there's
anything, anything at all

1060
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,620
you know or you've heard...

1061
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,320
Get somebody to give Julie
a lift home, will you?

1062
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:14,630
Sure.

1063
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,580
Don't you worry.

1064
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,540
'Dirty bastard.'

1065
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,650
'Dirty little bastard.'

1066
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:30,910
At Thomas's memorial.

1067
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,260
Down by the sea?

1068
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,750
Yeah, aye, he was in a right mood.

1069
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,350
Our Laura turned round to him and
said,

1070
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,960
'You can't talk about
the dead like that.'

1071
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:42,620
But he said that he wasn't
talking about Thomas.

1072
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:44,100
He was talking about some fella

1073
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:46,440
he'd just met at the memorial.

1074
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,400
The man was at the memorial?

1075
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:50,870
That's what he said.

1076
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,860
- Did you see him?
- No.

1077
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,530
Did Luke say who the man was?

1078
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,180
No.

1079
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,650
Where is she?

1080
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,480
Bathtub, rock pool, what next?

1081
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:17,760
Bodies of water. Think.

1082
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:21,810
Rivers, ponds, waterways,
get everybody onto it, Joe.

1083
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,090
<i>Just down there, sir.</i>

1084
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:31,020
I want somebody on
those tyre tracks.

1085
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:32,530
<i>Right, ma'am.</i>

1086
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:49,650
Davy...

1087
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,930
I don't understand why he'd want to
hurt Laura.

1088
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:05,530
I don't think he was
trying to hurt her.

1089
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,310
I think he was fighting to save her.

1090
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,380
We've found a girl's shoe, ma'am,

1091
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:16,690
but no sign of a body.

1092
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,060
Julie.

1093
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,260
Now, Julie...

1094
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,850
..we want just a simple...

1095
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:34,190
yes or no.

1096
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,230
It's my bairn's. It's my bairn's!

1097
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,510
No, no. Come on, Julie.

1098
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,220
It's OK. It's all right, Julie.

1099
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,940
- It's all right now.
- Is she in there?

1100
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:51,250
It's all right now.

1101
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:52,810
Come on.

1102
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,050
It's all right. Come on.

1103
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,720
Lily's ring...

1104
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:05,790
bought on your
credit card.

1105
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:08,260
Look, all this...

1106
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:11,870
it'll destroy my wife.

1107
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,340
Where is she?

1108
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:17,500
- Where's Laura Armstrong?
- Who?

1109
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:20,120
OK.

1110
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:24,630
You and Lily fell passionately
in something or other.

1111
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,880
- Yes.
- TGI Friday in the beach hut.

1112
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:28,310
- Yes?
- Yes.

1113
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,230
Until the rose lost its bloom,

1114
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,050
the less you wanted,
the more she needed.

1115
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:35,250
- Yes. Yes.
- Threats, pleading.

1116
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:38,360
Oh, don't look now, she's only
got a job teaching your child.

1117
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:39,770
- Yes.
- You must have been...

1118
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:41,230
Terrified, yes.

1119
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:46,680
- Marriage not safe.
- That's it. That's it. That's all there is.

1120
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:49,950
No. Thomas Sharp. Luke Armstrong.

1121
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,690
Two lads taking photographs

1122
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,000
- of you and Lily...
- Photos?

1123
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:54,520
Did they swear in
like a pair of Mafiosi,

1124
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:55,830
demanding hush money?

1125
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:58,470
Of course Thomas drowned. Stroke of
luck.

1126
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,120
- What are you talking about?
- You were there to see him off at the memorial.

1127
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:03,450
'Dirty bastard!' That luke

1128
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,760
- called you.
- What memorial?

1129
01:11:04,992 --> 01:11:07,980
- I was never at any memorial.
- You were there!

1130
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:10,930
- Luke saw you! He spoke to you.
- Look in my diary.

1131
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:12,250
See for yourself.

1132
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,890
Madrid, a conference.

1133
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,650
300 witnesses plus.

1134
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:26,160
If that's any help to you.

1135
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:31,480
Please, don't tell Felicity!
You'll tell her yourself.

1136
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,160
If Calvert wasn't at
the memorial, who was?

1137
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,450
And where are those photographs?

1138
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,990
She'll be dead by nightfall.

1139
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:00,390
Get in the car, ma'am.

1140
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,020
Charlie, hello.

1141
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,220
Yeah.

1142
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:10,450
All right. Thank you.

1143
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,750
Samuel Parr still unaccounted for.

1144
01:12:15,155 --> 01:12:16,710
And as for his wife...

1145
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,600
she overdosed on a bottle of pills

1146
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:20,460
and drowned in her own bath.

1147
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,270
Look at them,

1148
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:41,650
the dad, the mam and
the two little bairns.

1149
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,150
Do you think one of them
could have murdered Lily?

1150
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,410
- Por Peter's sake?
- Yeah, if you were that devoted...

1151
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,560
But Luke?

1152
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:52,240
Laura? Why would Peter Calvert

1153
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:54,030
want them dead?

1154
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:03,150
<i>'This is Sam Parr. Leave a message
and I'll phone you when I get back.'</i>

1155
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:05,310
<i>Sweetheart, it's me.</i>

1156
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,360
<i>Listen, Peter's in some
kind of trouble and I...</i>

1157
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:10,160
<i>I don't know, I...</i>

1158
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,230
<i>I keep trying your mobile.</i>

1159
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,250
<i>If this is about the
story, then I'm sorry,</i>

1160
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,560
<i>it's none of my business. OK?</i>

1161
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:18,570
<i>Just don't just shut me out.</i>

1162
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:20,460
<i>I can't stand it when you do that.</i>

1163
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,780
<i>Please,</i>

1164
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:23,410
<i>just call me.</i>

1165
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,780
Felicity? The loyal wife?

1166
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,160
What story?

1167
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,390
'He carried her over the spit of
rocks as if she were sleeping...'

1168
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,680
What is this?

1169
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,750
'It seemed fitting

1170
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:09,270
"that as he wrapped her
body in a lover's embrace,

1171
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:11,190
that she would die here,

1172
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:12,710
'like this,

1173
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,790
'surrounded by flowers...

1174
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,670
'The waves crashed

1175
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:21,790
'against the castle keep...'

1176
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:28,510
- Come on!
- Why the castle?

1177
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,350
It's an old haunt of my father's.

1178
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,260
They keep it on as
a nature reserve.

1179
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:34,760
Sea-watchers, mainly.

1180
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,670
- Joe's phone.
- Ma'am.

1181
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,570
- Holly.
- We found Samuel Parr.

1182
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:42,950
He's been at his wife's grave.

1183
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,750
It's the anniversary of
her death, apparently.

1184
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,550
- What, since this morning?
- Yeah, all day.

1185
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:52,860
So, what do you want
us to do with him?

1186
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,940
Well, thank him for his trouble
and take him home, I would.

1187
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,250
<i>OK.</i>

1188
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,900
Joe's answering service! What?

1189
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,950
I'm sorry, love.

1190
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,460
Right.

1191
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,970
- That was your midwife.
- You what? And?

1192
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:21,150
Your wife's waters just broke.

1193
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:26,250
- Look, I'll understand...
- Just shut up. Please.

1194
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,600
Two lads fighting by the shore.

1195
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,090
Lily and that man in the beach hut.

1196
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,870
A dirty bastard throwing
flowers at the memorial.

1197
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,880
The coroner's report.

1198
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,680
I asked Charlie to get
at the coroner's report

1199
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:55,710
- into the drowning.
- It might have slipped his mind.

1200
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:58,250
Slipped his mind?
I need that report!

1201
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,680
There might be one in the back.

1202
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:01,200
Where? Well, stop the car.

1203
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:03,440
- Wait, I cannot pull over...
- Pull over!

1204
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,870
'According
to the eyewitness,

1205
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:26,180
"the deceased and Luke Armstrong
were playing peacefully by the shore.

1206
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,180
'The deceased slipped
and fell into the sea.'

1207
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,380
But they weren't playing peacefully.
Laura told me!

1208
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,950
They were having a fight.

1209
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,750
But why would the
witness lie about it?

1210
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:39,590
Quid pro quo.

1211
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,310
Because the witness
was a dirty bastard

1212
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,590
who was willing to
keep his mouth shut

1213
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:49,340
so long as Luke Armstrong
did the same for him.

1214
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,310
Well, who was he? Who
was the eyewitness?

1215
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:53,050
Get in the car.

1216
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,100
Quiet!

1217
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:11,740
<i>Please. Please, just let me go.</i>

1218
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,780
Laura?

1219
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,200
Let her go.

1220
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,990
This one never saw you,

1221
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:29,840
she can't hurt you.

1222
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,130
<i>Luke will have told her.</i>

1223
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:35,720
No.

1224
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,750
You were looking for
a bird, weren't you,

1225
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,210
one Friday, looking for a bird.

1226
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,120
But when you looked out

1227
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:49,390
and glanced on the beach hut...

1228
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,080
there they were
through your binoculars,

1229
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:55,340
Peter having sex with Lily Marsh.

1230
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:56,990
<i>She was all over him!</i>

1231
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,930
Her mouth...

1232
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:02,350
all over him.

1233
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:05,020
On her knees.

1234
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,760
Disgusting at first

1235
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:11,070
and then...

1236
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:17,980
Clive.

1237
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,650
Well, you were lonely.

1238
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:24,330
Mam not there for you.

1239
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:31,340
It was mad. Incredible.

1240
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:35,340
I...I did try to tell Peter that I'd
seen them,

1241
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:37,660
but, I mean... (LAUGHS)

1242
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,320
..who's got the words
for a thing like that?

1243
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,140
But you went back, didn't you?

1244
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,380
Again and again. How long?

1245
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,460
Weeks? Months?

1246
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,720
<i>I was just looking.</i>

1247
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,090
But you weren't alone, were you?

1248
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,270
Two lads with a camera.

1249
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,690
Luke and Thomas, they'd
caught you spying.

1250
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:10,090
And now Thomas had you
on camera, didn't he?

1251
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,920
Click click. Peeping Tom.

1252
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:16,940
Dirty bastard!

1253
01:20:17,275 --> 01:20:18,575
Clive!

1254
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,420
Clive, where are you?

1255
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,820
Clive!

1256
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,060
Clive!

1257
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,540
Clive. Let her go.

1258
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:37,980
Clive?

1259
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:43,060
The way Thomas looked at me.

1260
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:44,610
The triumph.

1261
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:48,190
He was going to show Peter, he was
going to show the whole street.

1262
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:49,980
Drop it off with the paper round.

1263
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:51,290
What stopped him?

1264
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:54,090
The other lad.

1265
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,400
Luke...

1266
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,100
he stood up to Thomas, didn't he?

1267
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:01,130
They had a fight, the
camera fell in the water.

1268
01:21:01,915 --> 01:21:05,770
- Luke took your side.
- Yes. And I paid him back, didn't I?

1269
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:09,080
At the inquest, I lied for him.

1270
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:13,840
But it... it was like
he... he couldn't forgive me.

1271
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:16,380
Like I'd made him push his friend in
the water.

1272
01:21:16,515 --> 01:21:18,270
You should have heard him going on,

1273
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:19,930
and I knew, I knew!

1274
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:22,650
that one of these days
he'd come after me.

1275
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:25,590
He wasn't some bird of prey.

1276
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:27,790
He was just a lad.

1277
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,810
It's all right,
Laura. It's all right.

1278
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,880
Get him, Joe, stop him!

1279
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,620
Clive, stop!

1280
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,220
No!

1281
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,620
No!

1282
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,500
No!

1283
01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:58,520
Joe! Cut the net!

1284
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,390
- Cut the net, Joe!
- I'm trying!

1285
01:22:01,870 --> 01:22:03,960
Cut the net, Joe!
(CHOKING)

1286
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,740
Laura!

1287
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,400
It's all right.

1288
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,860
It's possible

1289
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:06,440
I may have confided about Lily.

1290
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,180
Clive was like that.

1291
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,210
Someone you could let off steam to.

1292
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:17,340
It's not like I asked him
to go out and finish her off.

1293
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:20,740
No, you didn't have to.
Clive worshipped you.

1294
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:23,285
- Please!
- He was besotted.

1295
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:26,970
Well, who do you think he
was watching every Friday?

1296
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,840
Clive had his own reasons
for wishing to harm...

1297
01:23:38,075 --> 01:23:40,290
Yeah, Luke Armstrong, yes.

1298
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,300
But it was your girl
trouble got him started.

1299
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:46,780
Just a few words from
an old friend in need.

1300
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:51,480
You turn murder into a
noble cause, Dr. Calvert.

1301
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:55,420
First Luke. And then Lily Marsh.

1302
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,740
Wipe out the whole blessed memory.

1303
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,510
I hope you don't
mind my asking, but...

1304
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:13,730
how did she take it?

1305
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:16,720
- What?
- The wife.

1306
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:18,590
You and Lily?

1307
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:23,410
She didn't seem all that
surprised in the end.

1308
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,580
No, I have a feeling she's
known for quite a while.

1309
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,330
Yes, well, she's very forgiving.

1310
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:32,080
Well, she would be.

1311
01:24:32,795 --> 01:24:35,510
Those in glass houses, Dr. Calvert.

1312
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,340
What?

1313
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,950
- You all right, love?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

1314
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,730
- How's it going?
- Hey, Joe, just in time.

1315
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,420
What's going on?

1316
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:25,910
I'm giving the old bugger
his marching orders.

1317
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,380
Hey, Joe, this is
Jack and Josephine.

1318
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,560
- You all right?
- Try saying that in a hurry!

1319
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,660
They're actually
a very nice couple.

1320
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,420
You think I'm mad, don't you?

1321
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,650
Moving into a big empty house.

1322
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,680
You'll soon fill it.

1323
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,620
We had a baby girl, by the way.

1324
01:25:57,650 --> 01:25:58,950
Thanks for asking.

1325
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,430
That's brilliant.

1326
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,180
That's brilliant.

1327
01:26:08,290 --> 01:26:10,010
Have you thought of a name yet?

1328
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:11,690
Francesca.

1329
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,170
You know, after the mother-in-law.

1330
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:17,530
- With the ravioli?
- Aye.

1331
01:26:18,432 --> 01:26:20,790
That's great.

1332
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,580
There's some bubbly
somewhere.

1333
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:24,020
No, no. I was just passing.

1334
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,830
- Good weight, was she?
- Aye. 3.6.

1335
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:34,780
Course it's all grams and kilograms
these days.

1336
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:36,840
I said, 'I only do imperial'.

1337
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,760
Our Jessie was er...seven and a half
pound.

1338
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,670
Michael was 6lb 12oz,

1339
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:46,550
but of course he was a
bit premature, as you know.

1340
01:26:46,995 --> 01:26:48,850
Anyway, listen, the
reason I popped round...

1341
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,670
Don't feel you have to say yes.

1342
01:26:55,490 --> 01:26:57,350
I know you're not a
great one for the bairns.

1343
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,640
It's just that Celine and I were
wondering

1344
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:04,610
if you'd ever do us the honour...

1345
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,700
Here.

1346
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:22,280
- This the bonny lass, is it?
- That's er... Forensics.

1347
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,740
Took them off Thomas
Sharp's camera.

1348
01:27:26,235 --> 01:27:27,750
About bloody time.

1349
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,760
Caught in the act.

1350
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:37,410
- Of peeping?
- Of being alone.

1351
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,580
Not for the faint-hearted.

1352
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,940
I never told you, did I?

1353
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:55,290
It was the same place
we dumped my mother.

1354
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:57,610
What's that?

1355
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:59,950
Dad's ashes.

1356
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,600
They weren't running
the ferry in those days.

1357
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:05,410
We went out in a little tugboat.

1358
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:10,250
Course I don't remember it
myself, like. I was too young.

1359
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:11,970
There's a photograph somewhere.

1360
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:16,580
Was there something else?

1361
01:28:17,315 --> 01:28:18,615
No, no.

1362
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,090
You enjoy your dinner.

1363
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:36,460

2
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:19,122
Taliban Compound Helmand Afghanistan

3
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,316
An occasion such as this is always
one of conflicting emotions,

4
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,999
as we celebrate the safe
return of our comrades

5
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,749
and the honours
that they have gained in the field.

6
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,678
We also remember the
injured and the fallen.

7
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,473
Shine up the old silver,
looking good, looking sexy!

8
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,957
Ladies and gentlemen - the
Royal Ordnance Fusiliers.

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,668
Has anybody seen the enemy?

10
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,395
Light House, 500m, rapid fire!

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,914
Move!

12
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,076
Here you are, boss. Have some rounds.

13
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,838
- Take that, Terry Taliban!
- This one's for Ollie!

14
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,677
Charge!

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,876
Man down! Man down!

16
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,791
 Wanna go home!

17
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,790
 Let me go home

18
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,358
 Let me...
 Let me go home

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,834
Yeah! Yeah!

20
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,474
 I feel so broke up

21
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,356
 I wanna go home

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,791
I hope he hasn't decided to stay.

23
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,035
Two tours of Afghan? Not likely.

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,831
Come here.

25
00:02:45,328 --> 00:02:59,852

26
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,311
Morning.

27
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,039
No.

28
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,071
No, they can be awkward buggers.

29
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,633
Listen, call Joe.
Tell him I'll pick him up on the way.

30
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,117
- You did it?
- Aye.

31
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,116
- How much?
- A pound.

32
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,957
That's what we used to get, Joe.

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,958
Yeah, well, inflation hasn't
hit the fairy world yet.

34
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,031
Go, then. Go to your other woman.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,798
- Babe, I'm between a rock and a hard place.
- Hm...

36
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,671
Well, I hope I'm the rock.

37
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,438
- Hi, Vera.
- Celine.

38
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,591
Mum, Mum, the tooth fairy
forgot to take the tooth!

39
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,911
She'll come back for it, pet.

40
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,399
Well, I wouldn't worry about it. She
was going to find out sooner or later.

41
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,350
Breakfast?

42
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,558
It's an army death. You'd have thought
military police would handle it themselves.

43
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,830
Boy soldiers playing at policemen.

44
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,589
Fine at banging up a couple of drunk
squaddies on a Saturday night.

45
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,716
But unexplained deaths...

46
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,751
out of their league.

47
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,710
Isn't it their case, though,
if it happens on military property?

48
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,557
Aye. Letter of the law, you're right.

49
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,230
But what happens in reality
is we both do what we're good at.

50
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,355
We do the investigating, and they
do the marching and the saluting.

51
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,351
Excuse me, sir.

52
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,309
- Captain Shepherd, SIB.
- Vera Stanhope.

53
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,430
- Chief Inspector, ma'am.
- DS Ashworth.

54
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,471
- Joe.
- Most people call me Shep.

55
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,750
And this is Lieutenant Colonel Chapell,
CO of the regiment.

56
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,031
Detective Chief Inspector,
welcome to Otterford.

57
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,799
A suicide, of course, is bad for morale.

58
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,035
So we're grateful to you
for your assistance.

59
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,548
Let's hope we can resolve this
as soon as possible.

60
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,556
If you need anything, please ask.

61
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,672
In the meantime, I leave you
in Captain Shepherd's capable hands.

62
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,517
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel.

63
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,680
And as soon as we've established
that the unexplained death is a suicide,

64
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,438
you'll be the first to know.

65
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,791
Right, Shep.

66
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,475
Staff Sergeant James Deverson.

67
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,351
Everyone called him Dev.

68
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,789
RLC, Military Cross.

69
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,116
He was EOD. Sorry, ma'am, bomb disposal.

70
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,516
Two tours to Afghanistan, and Iraq before that.
Recently returned.

71
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,552
Military Cross? That's
a big deal, isn't it?

72
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,593
- Aye, you got to the Palace for it.
- He was down there only last week.

73
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,113
- So where is it?
- He would have been wearing it last night.

74
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,869
- Anyone come across this medal?
- No, not yet, ma'am.

75
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,273
- Family?
- Married. Two kids.

76
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,437
- Were they...?
- No, they live off with the wife's mother.

77
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,869
- Weapon?
- It's a Browning, 9mm.

78
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,993
Standard army issue. It's got a silencer
on it, so he didn't want to be heard. His?

79
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,431
We don't carry weapons outside of theatre. He
had to have checked it out of the armoury.

80
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,233
- No note?
- None we've found, ma'am.

81
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,955
There might be something on that.
Have someone bag it up.

82
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,031
- Who discovered him?
- A new-minted sergeant out of Catterick.

83
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,038
He was supposed to move in
with his wife and baby this morning.

84
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,198
What, he was... shipping out again?

85
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,318
He was hanging up his boots.
15 years. His last night on barracks.

86
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,111
Ooh! Nice-looking lass.

87
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,148
- The wife?
- I'm afraid I'm not long in Otterford.

88
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,997
Sorry, didn't hear my alarm.

89
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,555
Well, you have to wake up in your
own bed to hear the alarm, Billy!

90
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,831
Better suit up.

91
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,433
Right, thoughts?

92
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,948
He's an armaments officer.

93
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,959
They know how to get access to all the equipment.
It looks like suicide.

94
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,993
After making it alive through a
couple of tours to Afghanistan?

95
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,759
Afghan affects people in
different ways, ma'am.

96
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,076
You see it here, when they come back.
Leaves its mark.

97
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,951
Ma'am.

98
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,878
- Looks like a squat.
- Aye, it's a bit grim, in't it?

99
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,115
Billy's got something
for you downstairs.

100
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,151
It smells in here.

101
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,912
Get Forensics to check
for traces of vomit.

102
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,835
No, it's too low.

103
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,394
Look, if I'm going to shoot myself...

104
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,592
firstly, I'm tense, so
I'm sitting up straight.

105
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,837
Second, I want my wrist behind the shot
because of the recoil.

106
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,269
So I hold it lower, shoot upwards.

107
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,072
Now, look at him.

108
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,476
Exit wound is too low.
It's the base of the skull.

109
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,038
But if he was asleep, head back, mouth
half open, like he was found...

110
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,435
And someone else shot
him through the mouth.

111
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,471
You think he was murdered?

112
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,359
It's too like a suicide...
to be a suicide.

113
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,353
State of shock. I said I'd
drive her home in a bit.

114
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,358
- Where's Shep?
- Getting the rest of the Sandancers together.

115
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,072
- The what?
- Dev's bomb team.

116
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,236
"Sandancer" must have
been their call sign.

117
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,111
Must have been a Shields lad, eh?

118
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,196
She said she'd meet us
up the mess up the way.

119
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,992
Right.

120
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,474
Get the statements first, then the gun.

121
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,838
Get Shep to take you to the armoury.

122
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,316
Eh, you'll be like a
kid in a sweetie shop.

123
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,232
Ma'am.

124
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,549
Morning. Thanks for coming.

125
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,559
This is Detective Chief lnspector Stanhope
of the Northumberland and City CID.

126
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,909
- Ma'am.
- Captain.

127
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:12,911
I expect some of you have heard that Staff
Sergeant Deverson died early this morning.

128
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,832
Initially, his death was
thought to be a suicide...

129
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,838
but we now have reason to believe
he was murdered.

130
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,032
So, which of you were with Staff Sergeant
Deverson after the meal last night?

131
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,831
Come on, show of hands.

132
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,918
So after the fireworks
at the Collingwood Memorial?

133
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,032
- Back to camp.
- What time?

134
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,071
I thought you liked real men, ma'am.

135
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,156
He's a bit boy band, is he not?

136
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,476
Answer Sergeant Ashworth's question,
Corporal Grafton.

137
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,594
I don't know what time.
Why don't you check with front gate?

138
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,515
So you'd been drinking since the meal?

139
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,949
And what makes you think
we only began then?

140
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,152
And what happened after?

141
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,510
- We all came home.
- Together?

142
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,794
- I don't remember.
- No, after the fireworks?

143
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,388
Yeah, I remember heading
over to the fireworks.

144
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,908
So how did you get home after?

145
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,951
Did Dev and Vince take you back?

146
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,472
We all signed in.
Then said our goodbyes.

147
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,317
What about Budgie?

148
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,796
He could hardly stand. Poor bastard.

149
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,149
Where did you wake up
this morning, Budgie?

150
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,151
The block. My own bed.

151
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,191
You can't remember getting there?

152
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,477
It always makes me feel
that little bit calmer.

153
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,911
I read once it's the positive ions
generated by the pounding of the waves.

154
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,554
But I think it's the wind.

155
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,354
Blows the cobwebs out of your head.

156
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,917
I don't know what to think.

157
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,072
First the chaplain came, saying he's
shot himself, and then you say...

158
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,829
You weren't with your
husband last night?

159
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,915
But I thought it was a celebration
dinner, to welcome the lads home?

160
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,794
Er... an army thing. Not for wives.

161
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,793
- So where were you?
- Home. You can ask my mum.

162
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,948
- You don't think that I had anything...?
- No. But I have to ask, pet.

163
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,194
You don't like it at the
barracks much, do you?

164
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,117
It's just with him being away
on tour so much, we felt...

165
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,159
it would be better if
I stayed with my mum.

166
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,318
And it's better for the kids not to be
surrounded by it all at the barracks.

167
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,635
But this time he was home for good?

168
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,392
I've longed for that
for years, and now...

169
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,155
And there weren't any problems?

170
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,791
With anyone in the regiment or his team,
I mean?

171
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,310
No. Not that I know of. Why?

172
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,634
What about in Afghanistan?

173
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,152
He didn't like to talk about out there and I...
I didn't want to know.

174
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,589
- Letters?
- Well, it's emails now.

175
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,676
But he was never much for writing.

176
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,236
When he had his soldier head on, which was
24/7, there's not much time for family.

177
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,431
Joe?

178
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,231
Right, I'm on my way.

179
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,273
The Browning 9mm is standard army issue
since the Second World War

180
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,515
but they're being
decommissioned in batches.

181
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,552
The one that killed Deverson
should've been done eight months ago.

182
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,068
- So someone took it instead?
- Mm-hm, yeah.

183
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,432
- What am I looking at?
- The officer that signed it out.

184
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,152
James Deverson?

185
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,239
He'd have known it would be decommissioned.
So it must've got lost in the bureaucracy.

186
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,396
Excuse me.

187
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,596
- What about forensics? Prints on the gun?
- Yeah, only Deverson's.

188
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,478
So the killer knew he had the gun. Knew
not to leave prints on it, obviously.

189
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,072
Silencer?

190
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,032
Not army issue,
not according to the armaments officer.

191
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,470
Home-made or modified. Expertly done.

192
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,353
But something an ATO like Deverson
would know how to make?

193
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,276
Mm-hm.

194
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,871
What about the team?

195
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,356
Corporal Vincent Grafton.
He's not giving anything away.

196
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,914
Lance Corporal O'Connor
claims that he drank so much

197
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,030
he blacked out and can't
remember a thing.

198
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,877
That's fortuitous.

199
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,833
Shep checked with the front-gate log. He
signed in with Dev at 10 past midnight.

200
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,314
As forthe others, didn't
hear or see anything.

201
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,237
- Did you get prints and swabs?
- Mm-hm.

202
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,795
Ma'am. Lieutenant Colonel Chapell.

203
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,950
He's right, we've nothing.

204
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,908
Nothing from his men,
nothing from the wife.

205
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,913
The only prints on the gun they
appropriated from the armoury are his.

206
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,599
He seems very keen for us
to believe it's suicide.

207
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,234
There's a lot riding on Billy's theory.

208
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,195
It's not a theory, it's a fact. You did tell
him I'm a pathologist, not a homeopath?

209
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,549
Besides, what's he going
to threaten you with?

210
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,751
You're outside his bailiwick, aren't you?
Outside everyone's.

211
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,995
But he can still make things difficult.

212
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,352
Here.

213
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,031
- What's that?
- Little present. Front tooth. Most of it, at least.

214
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,550
Found it in the back ofthe victim's head.
If you were going to do it yourself,

215
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,353
you wouldn't shoot yourself
through half-closed teeth.

216
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,789
So what are you saying?

217
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,552
Deverson conks on the bed, still in
his full formal gear from the meal.

218
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,113
Middle of the night, gets up, vomits,

219
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,958
comes downstairs for a glass of water,

220
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,468
sits in the chair to stop
the world spinning?

221
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,478
Forensics confirmed there were
traces of vomit in the bedroom.

222
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,397
Yeah, but Deverson didn't vomit.

223
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,159
Had half a keg of beer in his gut
when we opened him up.

224
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,430
Had to mop the place clean after.

225
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,553
And here's me thinking
you'd been partying in the morgue again.

226
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,390
So there was someone else
in the house with him?

227
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,758
Put that down, Kenny. This is an
incident room, not a greasy spoon.

228
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,076
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a visitor.

229
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,669
Captain Shepherd
from Her Majesty's Royal Military Police

230
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,188
is going to assist us
in our investigations.

231
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,791
Now...

232
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,470
Staff Sergeant James Deverson,
known to everyone as Dev.

233
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,750
Recently awarded the Military Cross.

234
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,793
- Speaking of which, any sign yet?
- No, nothing in the scene-of-crime report.

235
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,632
Now, the killer wanted us to believe
he'd committed suicide. Why?

236
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,117
- Make him look like a coward.
- Personally, I think it takes some courage.

237
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,756
But the common view, of which you are the proud
possessor, Kenny, is that it is cowardly.

238
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,472
What is that?

239
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,354
That's the high-speed broadband upgrades
we're crying out for, ma'am.

240
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,472
Well, I'm sure it's going to assist
greatly with all your tweeting.

241
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,034
But would someone tell 'em to shut up?

242
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,793
Now, then... he was
killed with a handgun

243
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,150
that Deverson himself
signed out of the garrison armoury.

244
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,276
So who would want him dead?

245
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,995
Wife - Laura? Motive?

246
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,072
- Him never being around.
- So why kill him when he finally comes back?

247
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,190
Playing away from home
as well as working.

248
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,233
Hm? He was clutching her
photo, when he died.

249
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,400
No, she seemed genuinely distraught, plus her
mother confirmed she was at home that night.

250
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,791
What about members of his team?

251
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,992
Vince Grafton, his infantry escort,
Dev's bodyguard when he was defusing.

252
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,394
Lance Corporal Kevin O'Connor.

253
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,194
Fusilier, point man to the team,
nicknamed Budgie.

254
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,629
Now, both of them had a
skinful that night.

255
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,037
Grafton claims they came back around midnight,
said their goodbyes. He went back to his block.

256
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,911
Budgie doesn't remember a thing.

257
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,839
But the traces of vomit tell us there was
someone in the house with him that night.

258
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,270
Did you get Forensics
to crosscheck with their samples?

259
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,599
Aye. They said they'll try their best, boss. But,
apparently, there's a variety of DNAs in vomit.

260
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,599
- Depends on what you put in.
- Oh. Thanks for that!

261
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,670
Did either of you get any sense that any
of them held any grudges against him?

262
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,474
All the soldiers I spoke to yesterday seemed
to respect him, look up to him, even.

263
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,718
Vince, I don't know whether it's his soldier's
code, keep it in the family sort of thing,

264
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,991
but Vince did say that
Dev could be a mean bastard sometimes.

265
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,508
- Meaning?
- He clammed up after that.

266
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,235
Said he meant nothing by it.
They were all under stress out there.

267
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,512
- Did you check Deverson's military record?
- Yeah. It's exemplary.

268
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,518
Does it say what he got
the Military Cross for?

269
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,471
Mm. Heroism under enemy fire.

270
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,750
His team were lured into a trap.

271
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,395
His second in command Oliver Barton
triggered an IED.

272
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,351
It was pressure released.
He was blown up.

273
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,755
Dev had to defend his
team from the Taliban,

274
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,076
extract his comrade's body and his men
without further casualties.

275
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,511
There's a full report here from Lieutenant
Colonel Chapell, CO at Otterford.

276
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,751
Brave man.

277
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,398
- Any of the team mention this Oliver Barton?
- No.

278
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,429
- Did you know him, Shep?
- No, I'm only in the post a few months.

279
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,356
Right, Kenny, I want checks on Vince
Grafton and this Budgie O'Connor.

280
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,075
Shep, I want background
on this Oliver Barton.

281
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,716
I want the logbook from the front gate,
CCTV tapes from the night before last.

282
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,070
I want a list of everyone
who went in or came out of the barracks.

283
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,511
- Joe, any mention of next of kin for Barton?
- Yeah, there is.

284
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,551
- I want someone to talk to them.
- Me, ma'am.

285
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,352
Where are they?

286
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,188
The Cadvar Estate.
He's the estate manager there.

287
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,515
- What, the Cadvar?
- Yeah.

288
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,438
- Do you know it?
- Mm, years back.

289
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,397
I'll tell you what, we'll take
this one, Joe. Sorry, pet.

290
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,159
- Ma'am.
- Thanks.

291
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,555
Kenny, Deverson's laptop.

292
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:42,197
Emails..See if there was anything going on in Afghanistan.
Bullying, that sort of thing.

293
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,913
And see if he was carrying
on, like you suggest.

294
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,071
Er... password?

295
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,358
No, that's what the detective part
of detective constable means, Kenny.

296
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,074
Significant dates, kids'
names, anything at all.

297
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,758
Come on, we've got work to do.

298
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,749
Keith and Diana Barton. He's a former sergeant
major in the Royal Ordnance Fusiliers.

299
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,920
He retired from the regiment 15 years ago.
Now he runs shooting parties on the estate.

300
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,591
So how is it you know this place again? Was it
coming to balls here when you were a lass?

301
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,030
My dad, he had a bit of a racket going
with the shoot manager.

302
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,071
Must be this Barton.

303
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,871
Whenever he spotted a peregrine's
or a goshawk's nest, he'd call my dad.

304
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,595
Up he'd come and take the eggs,
and the young, if there were any.

305
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,756
Why did he want to get rid of them?

306
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,076
Birds of prey pick off the
chicks they breed for the shoot.

307
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,231
Old bugger made me turn a blind eye.

308
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,551
Up you get, up! Good girls.

309
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,475
- Mr Barton?
- A moment.

310
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,958
Blanking in the woods before tomorrow's shoot.
Stop the birds straying.

311
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,076
DCI Vera Stanhope.

312
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,395
Stanhope?

313
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,476
- Anything to...?
- Aye, daughter.

314
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,988
Ah, so the poacher's
girl's a gamekeeper.

315
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,110
Better watch what I say!

316
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,436
Actually, we're here to talk
about Oliver, your son.

317
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,197
Have you got a minute?

318
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,317
The day he got his tapes at Otterford.

319
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,989
- Thank you, Mrs Barton. You shouldn't have.
- It's Diana, please. It's nothing.

320
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,830
You served with the Royal Ordnance Fusiliers
too, Mr Barton, out of Otterford?

321
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,472
- I did my time.
- He's being modest.

322
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,431
Rose to sergeant major, didn't you, sir?

323
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,152
Thanks.

324
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,714
And you still retain
links with the regiment?

325
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,798
Cut off my leg, and you'd see Royal Ordnance
Fusiliers written right through me.

326
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,435
So you would have been at the dinner
the night before last?

327
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,471
Oh, we wouldn't miss it.

328
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,552
It was our chance to, you know...
remember Ollie.

329
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,079
Well, you've sacrificed more than most.

330
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,111
Yes. Yes, we have.

331
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,836
Did you come straight home after?

332
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,029
We went to Dominic's
for a nightcap. Why?

333
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,833
- Dominic?
- Lieutenant Colonel Chapell.

334
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,556
I was his platoon sergeant on his first tour.
He was fresh out of Sandhurst.

335
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,476
I thought you wanted
to talk about Ollie.

336
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,110
I'm afraid to have to
tell you that yesterday

337
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:54,395
the body of your son's immediate superior,
James Deverson, was found at the barracks.

338
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,150
Well, as I said, I am - we
are - close to Dominic.

339
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,310
He called me yesterday. Deverson
was Ollie's colleague, after all.

340
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,955
Which is why I want to talk to you
about Ollie's death.

341
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,719
- It's a needless bloody waste!
- Keith, please.

342
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,875
He did stand on an IED,
didn't he, Mr Barton?

343
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,309
And then Deverson extracted his body
and the team?

344
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,272
That's what they gave him
the MC for, wasn't it?

345
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,358
- You don't think that is what happened?
- How can we know what happened?

346
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,518
Now Deverson's dead too, what more can we tell you?
We weren't there, were we?

347
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,473
No, I understand that, and I'm sorry
to have brought it all back to you.

348
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,511
It's not like it ever goes away.

349
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,871
I'll see you out.

350
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,311
Thanks.

351
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,390
- So it's a big shoot?
- Two days.

352
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,991
- Your guns?
- The estate's.

353
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:03,114
Don't worry, they're all registered and licensed.
Just giving them the once-over before tomorrow.

354
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,071
They must be big business, these shoots.

355
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,634
It helps maintain the place,
keeps some of us employed.

356
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,274
This one's private,
for his lordship and his friends.

357
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,517
I'd better get those dogs up there,
so there are still birds to shoot at,

358
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,473
make sure there's enough game for them to feel
like the last of the great white hunters.

359
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,351
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye.

360
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,391
Thanks, Mr Barton.

361
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,955
So how come
you know so much about the army?

362
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,073
I used to love everything to do with the army
when I was a kid. It seemed like a way out.

363
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,190
Why didn't you choose that as a career?

364
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,438
Celine. Imagine her letting me go to
Afghanistan six months at a time!

365
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,837
Their loss! Now, get Shep to
check their alibis with Chapell.

366
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,236
And Laura Deverson told us
the dinner wasn't for wives.

367
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,790
- Is the Provo about?
- Yeah, he's around. I'll give him a ring

368
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,831
Right.

369
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,478
Laura 2000. Dev's email.

370
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,590
He married Laura in 2000.

371
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,030
Eh, you're not just a pretty
face, then, Kenny. Hm?

372
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,758
- What does it tell us?
- Now, that's the problem.

373
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,712
It's mainly spam, phishing scams.

374
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,752
He didn't seem to use it much, though.
Only the emails, that is.

375
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,509
Eh, don't think you can get all lads mag
just cos Holly's no longer here.

376
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,593
- Is there nothing to his wife, even?
- No, EOD, boss.

377
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,552
- Explosive Ordnance?
- No, no, no. "Everyone's divorced."

378
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,670
It's an army joke Shep told us.

379
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,314
Oh, telling each other
jokes now, are we?

380
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,599
Just because he's not emailing his missus
doesn't mean they're getting a divorce.

381
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,792
- It's not like he's emailing anybody else.
- Maybe he didn't have high-speed broadband.

382
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,515
Well, you'd better check, see if there's
any sign of divorce proceedings.

383
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,755
Solicitors, banks, that sort of thing.

384
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,679
Boss? Turns out there were
traces of blood in that vomit.

385
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,472
From an ulcer.

386
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,636
- They've got a match?
- Uh-huh.

387
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,431
Budgie!

388
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,839
You need to put that beer down, Budgie,
and come with me.

389
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,080
Do you understand why
you're here, Kevin?

390
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,629
- Kevin, do you understand?
- Don't call me that.

391
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,114
OK. Budgie.

392
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,318
How did you come by a name like that?

393
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,318
Dev said I was like a
canary down a mine.

394
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,792
If my Val started tweeting.

395
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,550
- Your what?
- Vallon. Metal detector.

396
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,479
Oh, so you went out in front, did you,
looking for lEDs?

397
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,355
So why didn't he call you Canary?

398
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,518
Because I'm a Fusilier. Nicknamed the
Budgies because of our dress hats.

399
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,235
Typical British army, Dev said,
always messing up on equipment.

400
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,317
"They send me a budgie
instead of a canary."

401
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,317
Have an ulcer, Budgie?

402
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,033
Only you told my sergeant here you couldn't
remember what happened the night before last.

403
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,678
But we found vomit with traces of blood,

404
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,075
your blood, at Dev's house.

405
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,909
So do you remember going back to Dev's?

406
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,391
Well, what were you doing there?

407
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,513
I asked, Budgie, what
you were doing there.

408
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,159
I want to confess to the murder of
Staff Sergeant James Deverson, ma'am.

409
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,795
After the dinner, we
went out on the piss.

410
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,391
Drinking all day. Been like that since Afghan.
Need to knock myself out.

411
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,239
But out at them fireworks,
the legs went from under me.

412
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,111
And then what?

413
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,355
And then Dev took me home.

414
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,391
His home?

415
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,910
Gave me some tabs... to help me sleep.

416
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,835
He had trouble and all
himself like that.

417
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,717
Said for me to take the bed.
Said he didn't use it any more.

418
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,388
Then the next thing I know I'm come to and I'm
staring at Dev, and he's shot through the head.

419
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,471
And I know it's me that's done it.

420
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,752
But it looked like suicide.

421
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,551
- You knew he had a gun?
- Some lads bring mementos back from Afghan.

422
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,639
- His gun was army issue, Budgie.
- I mean, they have kit, their own kit.

423
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,797
- What about the silencer?
- What do you want from me? I did it!

424
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,354
I shot him, I took his
gun and I shot him.

425
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,196
What, you don't think I'm capable? Hm?

426
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,389
And then I made it look like suicide, just like
you said, and then I scarpered, back to my block.

427
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,279
Dev rated you. You did
two tours together.

428
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,677
But he could be hard on you, Budgie,
couldn't he? Hm?

429
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,070
- Cos sometimes I messed up.
- That why you killed him?

430
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,193
- We wouldn't have all got through without Dev.
- But you didn't all get through, did you?

431
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,708
Ollie didn't make it.

432
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,752
We're just trying to understand
why you killed him.

433
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,792
You talk like he was a
second father to you.

434
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,634
Was it because he was leaving the army?

435
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,311
Leaving you?

436
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,910
- You take his medal, his Military Cross?
- No.

437
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,758
- Not even as a memento?
- No, I didn't mind his leaving. OK?

438
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,591
What about Ollie?

439
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,993
What about Ollie's death?

440
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,511
Did you blame Dev for that?

441
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,077
No.

442
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,079
No, that was my fault.

443
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,709
It was me that got Ol killed.

444
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,399
Ollie! Ollie!

445
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,670
Dev was the hero.

446
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,790
He got us and Ollie's body out of there.

447
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,031
I didn't spot them other lEDs.

448
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,831
I told him that the path was clear.

449
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,508
Ma'am, Chapell's confirmed
1:45am.

450
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,878
Right. Kenny, has Billy
confirmed time of death?

451
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,390
Between 1 and 2am, ma'am.

452
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,479
- And I checked CCTV.
- 1:48am.

453
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,999
- What about Chapell himself?
- He's the commanding officer, ma'am.

454
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,953
- Well, no-one's above suspicion, Shep.
- But I thought we had our man anyway.

455
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,468
Found at the crime scene.
Valium. 10 grain.

456
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,193
There was enough Valium in the vomit
to knock out a horse.

457
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,708
And as you know,
Dev was long dead before dawn.

458
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,671
What are you thinking?

459
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,430
I'm thinking whatever Budgie's done,
or thinks he's done,

460
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,516
he didn't do this.

461
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,197
This didn't happen in
some drunken brawl.

462
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,309
This was a clinical job.

463
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,874
You can take that. I'm
going to discharge him.

464
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,552
Ashworth.

465
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,229
Ma'am, it's Keith Barton downstairs. I
asked him to pop by with Ollie's laptop,

466
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,750
just in case there was anything on it -
bullying, troubles, like you said.

467
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,792
Now, that's what I like to see.
Bit of initiative.

468
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,351
Tell him I'll be downstairs in a sec.

469
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,551
No, there's hundreds of 'em, boss.
Come on, boss, we can't get him.

470
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,160
He's out there. He's dead. He's one of ours.
Come on, lads!

471
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,671
I don't know what happened, boss. I cleared them.
I've cleared the lEDs, I'm telling you!

472
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,711
Come on, Budgie, man up!

473
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,832
We can't move.
Ollie's out there! Ollie's out there!

474
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,236
Let go of me. Please, please!

475
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,397
Please, Budgie. Please.

476
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,071
It's not gunfire, Budgie.

477
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,070
No.

478
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,351
It's just drilling.

479
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,512
Is it loud noises... like drilling?

480
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,994
Bring it all back for you? Is it?

481
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,357
Your fireworks? Is that what
happened that night, Budgie?

482
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,919
The fireworks?
You didn't want to be on your own?

483
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,470
Or maybe... maybe Dev thought you
shouldn't be on your own. Hm?

484
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,353
So he took you back
to his place instead?

485
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,755
But some time in the night you woke up, and
that's when you saw him, didn't you, Budgie?

486
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,836
And you thought you'd done it, hm?

487
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,915
Budgie, he'd been dead for hours.

488
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,111
Stand down, Budgie! Stand down!

489
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,549
Joe, easy!

490
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,994
OK, Budgie. OK.

491
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,717
But I saw myself do it.

492
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,035
You didn't kill him, Budgie.

493
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,228
I can still see him,
lying there in the sand.

494
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,072
His limbs like a jigsaw I
can't put back together.

495
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,399
Who?

496
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,191
You mean Dev?

497
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,918
Or Ollie?

498
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,271
The dead don't leave you.

499
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,631
What are you looking at?

500
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,959
Go and get me a large
drink and a psychiatrist.

501
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,109
At last, the cry for help.

502
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,511
I'll make you a wee cup of tea, ma'am.

503
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,273
I know that it would've been
Dev's last will and testament

504
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,993
that we get absolutely
hammered in his memory.

505
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,554
OK. To Dev.

506
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,273
To Dev!
- Sandancer legend.

507
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,279
Don't they give these lads any kind of
help, after all they've been through?

508
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,950
Counsellors are available, but soldiers have
to know they've got a problem to consult them.

509
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,072
And if they do, it's still seen
as a sign of weakness by some.

510
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,156
I'll make some calls tonight.

511
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,712
Thanks for the lift.

512
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,548
- You don't want to overdo the exercise.
- I've still got 10km to run when I get home.

513
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,876
- What, are you being punished for something?
- Iron Man challenge.

514
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,195
Well, cannot let the RMPs down.

515
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,674
Show the grunts what us monkeys can do.

516
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,711
That's what they call us!

517
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,954
- Where's Budgie?
- Off with the birds.

518
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,719
I sent him a text. Told
him where we were.

519
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,631
Joe?

520
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,638
Just to let you know,
Ollie's emails have been cleaned out.

521
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,636
His folders, his trash-can, everything.

522
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,558
And it wasn't done two months ago
before he died.

523
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,955
- It was done today.
- Oh?

524
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,989
- Well, Mum or Dad?
- His dad seemed fine about bringing it in.

525
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,112
Well, let's pay them
another visit tomorrow.

526
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,878
And Laura Deverson.

527
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,198
Now, Joe, you get yourself home
to Celine and the kids.

528
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,993
- Good night.
- Night. Night.

529
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,911
Where are we going, lads?

530
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,071
Right, I'll see you losers later.

531
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,429
- Where are you off?
- Oh, aye, Grafton, where are you off to?

532
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,317
- How does it compare?
- Different angle to the first.

533
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,833
Upward. Entered jaw here,
exited skull... here.

534
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,314
Might also have been awake
when it happened.

535
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,351
Gun?

536
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,470
Silencer. It's just like the other one.

537
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,796
It's not army, though.
Not British army, anyway. Russian maybe.

538
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,469
A little memento from Afghanistan.
Isn't that what he said?

539
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,594
Oh, well, see what there
are in the way of prints.

540
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,872
- Note?
- No.

541
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,034
- So what are we saying? Same killer?
- Or a copycat.

542
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:25,471
Apart from the angle of shot,
but crouching down could explain that.

543
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,431
Any sign of a break-in?

544
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,436
None I can see.

545
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,114
- Who found him?
- Vincent Grafton.

546
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,955
I thought maybe I'd better check on him.

547
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,234
Was the door locked or unlocked?

548
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,911
Open.

549
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,714
Why did you think you
needed to check on him?

550
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,672
I thought maybe he'd bugged out or...

551
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,029
Or what? Killed himself?

552
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,712
He was a soldier, and a good soldier.
He wouldn't have done that.

553
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,313
I was just checking he
wasn't ill or something.

554
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,511
What did you do last night?

555
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,229
I was out. Drinking to Dev.

556
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:35,116
- After?
- Came back here. Went to bed.

557
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,151
Ma'am...

558
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,550
Why was he in uniform?

559
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,751
We were a guard down.
Must have had to do last-minute stag.

560
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,553
Well, we'll need the logbook
from the front gate, Shep.

561
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,434
Right. And the CO wishes
to speak to you, ma'am.

562
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,357
Is it OK, if I...?

563
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,714
Thanks.

564
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:17,909
This latest death is terrible. For the barracks, for
the regiment, as well as being a tragedy in itself.

565
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,839
Yet I can't help but think
that it might have been prevented.

566
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,633
If you had not gone around
chasing phantom murderers,

567
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,150
then perhaps Corporal O'Connor might not
have taken his life in the same way.

568
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,954
We believe somebody killed these men
and might kill more.

569
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,434
And I might be able
to get to the heart of the matter

570
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,040
if you and your men
showed a little more cooperation.

571
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:42,871
I'm sorry. I don't understand, Chief Inspector.
Hasn't Captain Shepherd been of assistance?

572
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,070
Oh, Captain Shepherd's
been a great help.

573
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,716
Though I believe
that something happened in Afghanistan.

574
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:56,759
Something that links the deaths of these two
soldiers, but nobody's prepared to talk about it.

575
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,553
And what do you suppose
that something is?

576
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,194
Oliver Barton.

577
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,479
I've written a full report.

578
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,671
- I've seen it. It's in Deverson's file.
- Then you know what occurred.

579
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:13,431
I spoke to Keith Barton, and he was
reluctant to endorse the official version.

580
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,916
So I did a little bit of reading up
on military procedure last night

581
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:22,557
and I discovered it was Deverson's job to
ensure that the incident site is safe.

582
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,717
Chief Inspector, I do not believe
that you have the authority...

583
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,910
Did Deverson follow procedure?

584
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,712
Maybe not to the letter, but...

585
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,876
So he could be seen to be responsible?

586
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,355
Barton was Deverson's number two.

587
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,836
Even if he technically should not have
been the one to secure the ground,

588
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,836
he had the skill-set to do so.

589
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,113
So it is only in the letter of the law that Keith
Barton and his family might have a case.

590
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,431
What sort of a case?

591
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,317
They were pursuing the matter?

592
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,271
I cannot speak for them.

593
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,069
On the night that James
Deverson was killed,

594
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,237
you invited the Bartons back
to your house for drinks.

595
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,030
- Did you talk about Ollie?
- Amongst other things.

596
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,039
They wanted you to push for an inquiry.

597
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,471
And you told them no.

598
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,831
What time did they leave?

599
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,598
As I told Captain Shepherd,
45am.

600
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:37,560
Shep, you stay here, take statements -
Dev's team, what's left of them.

601
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,591
Anyone who saw Budgie last night.

602
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,551
And guns.

603
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,878
You've got to find all these personal
arsenals before anyone else gets hurt.

604
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,476
Er, are Keith or Diana home?

605
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,796
No. Dad's with the shoot
and Mum's at the cash-and-carry.

606
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,238
Can I help?

607
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,032
Peas in a pod?

608
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,397
The terrible twins,
Mum always used to call me and Ollie.

609
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,034
And you're with the Royal
Ordnance Fusiliers too?

610
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,878
Medical Corps, but I'm
based at Otterford.

611
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,718
Still completing my training
at Newcastle City Hospital.

612
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,672
Ah! What, then you'll go to Afghanistan,
will you?

613
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,995
If I'm needed. It's sad to say,

614
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,396
but theatre of ops is one of the best
places to learn new theatre skills.

615
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,431
What was it you wanted?

616
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,278
Could we have a look at Ollie's room?

617
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,311
See if we can get some idea.

618
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,476
He still had a room here?

619
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,391
Yeah.

620
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,112
But why?

621
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,037
We're looking into your brother's death,

622
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,959
and trying to find out
exactly what happened in Afghanistan.

623
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,511
We were very different, me and Ol.

624
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,915
I'd bury myself in some science books,

625
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,078
and he'd be into the back of an old
computer or radio or circuit board.

626
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,513
Dad wanted us to go to uni
and then on to officer training.

627
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,348
He'd risen up through the ranks. He
wanted his sons to go further than him.

628
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,152
That's perfectly natural.

629
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,875
But Ollie knew what he wanted. He didn't
want to be ordering men to do things.

630
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,037
Be in there, getting his hands dirty,
doing them himself.

631
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,916
He signed up as a private after school.

632
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,311
Ollie had just been selected for his
final training to become an ATO.

633
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,909
So he'd have then been qualified
to do Dev's job?

634
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,356
Deverson insisted that he'd only go
back out if Ollie was his number two.

635
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,789
- Or what?
- He'd quit.

636
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,150
But Ollie could have said no, right?

637
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:15,199
Dev would have made sure that was
him finished in ordnance disposal.

638
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,952
Deverson must have thought
highly of him, all the same.

639
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,355
You have to trust the men
you're out there with.

640
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,278
What do you think happened
in Helmand, Alex?

641
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,515
Look, your parents think Ollie's death
might've been preventable.

642
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,835
They think there might be grounds
for an inquiry.

643
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,351
So why don't you tell us what you think
happened out there, and maybe we can help.

644
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,671
Deverson defused an IED.

645
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,396
They did the controlled explosion, but then
he sent Ollie in to give the all-clear.

646
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,469
That's Deverson's job, as officer
in charge, to give the all-clear.

647
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,074
But how would Deverson know
there were more lEDs?

648
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,237
He'd been up to the incident site.
He'd seen the lie of the land.

649
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,953
If there were any more ground signs
of devices, he'd know.

650
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,798
You think he wanted Ollie killed?

651
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,588
Well, I'm not saying that.

652
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,839
And now that Deverson's dead,
we'll never know.

653
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,436
Were you here the night
Deverson was killed?

654
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,153
- Anyone vouch for you?
- Yeah.

655
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,237
Er... no.

656
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,030
My parents were here earlier in
the evening before the dinner.

657
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,038
- What about last night?
- I was on duty at the hospital.

658
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,116
And your parents? Where were they?

659
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:43,790
They were up at the main house. There was
a dinner for the first day of the shoot.

660
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,835
Ollie's laptop that your father brought in
to us yesterday, the emails had been wiped.

661
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,031
Know anything about that, Alex?

662
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,551
You've got to help us here.

663
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,270
It was nothing to do with Afghanistan.
It was girlfriend stuff.

664
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,515
Private, that's all.

665
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:11,672
He's dead. Is he not
entitled to his dignity?

666
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,711
Uh-huh. All right.

667
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,756
No, that's great. Thanks, Kenny.

668
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,598
Cadvar House confirmed
the Bartons were there last night.

669
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,154
- Alex Barton?
- The hospital says he was on night shift.

670
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,191
- Laura Deverson?
- At home.

671
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,153
- Oh. Anything on divorce proceedings?
- Kenny says no sign.

672
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,239
- And the good news?
- Vincent Grafton.

673
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,835
You might be interested in this, then.

674
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,710
I did a search of the lines,
looking for illegal firearms.

675
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,272
Well, where do you come across
a collection like this?

676
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,759
You'd be surprised what $20 will get you
at a souk in Basra or Sangin.

677
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,314
Did you talk to the others
who were with him last night?

678
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,558
Uh-huh. They said he left them down at the
quayside around midnight. But look at this.

679
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,591
From the logbook at the front gate.

680
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,272
Right, then, Vince,
I think you'd better come with us.

681
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,832
You arresting me?

682
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,190
Can do, if you like, unless you've got
licences for your little arsenal.

683
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,955
So you were out on the lash
on Dean Street last night?

684
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,670
Had a few bevvies.

685
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,393
Only signed back in at 11:30pm.

686
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,436
Check it back at 11:30?

687
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,155
If that's what it says.

688
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:06,309
Oh, only the name before yours
gets back at 12:20am.

689
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,952
Your colleagues said they left you down
at the quayside. Were you with anyone?

690
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,072
- Maybe I got lucky.
- A woman? She have a name?

691
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,032
You don't think much of women, do you,
Corporal?

692
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,551
I like them. Lots.

693
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,672
I just don't want to get too close to them.
They mess you up, when you're a soldier.

694
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,029
Like Ollie?

695
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,310
I don't know what you're talking about.

696
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,318
Well, he had girlfriend
problems, didn't he?

697
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,912
Yeah.

698
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,428
He had some problems
with his bird before...

699
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,232
before the last tour.

700
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,748
So? It's pretty common in our line.

701
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,149
What's her name? Ollie's girlfriend.

702
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,556
- She have one?
- I'm sure she did. But I didn't know her, did I?

703
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:14,953
Listen, Vince, Budgie was killed with a
weapon you smuggled back from Afghanistan.

704
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,151
Your prints are all over it.
So I suggest you start telling us.

705
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,270
So what if Budgie was shot with my gun?

706
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,435
Doesn't mean I did it. He knew I had them guns.
Loads of the guys did.

707
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,029
- Where were you last night?
- I was with someone, wasn't I?

708
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,877
You stop off at a hotel or a B&B?

709
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,275
I was down the front. Didn't get back till dawn.

710
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,317
My mate Kez was on stag at front gate
that morning. Ask him.

711
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,278
Kenny, I've got to check something.
Watch our back, will you?

712
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,072
Yeah, sure.

713
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,317
What happened in Afghanistan
the day Oliver Barton died?

714
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:02,591
Listen, Vince, I'm not interested in the
rights or wrongs of what goes on out there.

715
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,077
But I believe that the death of Budgie and
of Deverson have something to do with it.

716
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,194
Dev changed, the last tour.

717
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,350
He was still the best
at his job and all.

718
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,598
You could put your house on him
to get you through.

719
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,678
But outside, he didn't join in.

720
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,953
No banter.

721
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,592
Distant.

722
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,151
Especially with Ollie.

723
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:04,273
Do you blame Deverson for Ollie's death?

724
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,951
Or do you blame Budgie?

725
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,354
The sentry admits
he entered the wrong time on the log.

726
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,356
Said it was well after
dawn when he got back.

727
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,916
Yeah, can we trust that? These lads would
rather go to jail than tell us the truth.

728
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,792
Get Shep to check the CCTV.

729
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,471
- You still think he did it?
- Aye.

730
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,876
- Where are you off to?
- Evening shift will be starting.

731
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,115
You can knock off when you've done that.

732
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,471
Stupid!

733
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,318
Have you got a moment?
- Er, yeah.

734
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,478
Right, Budgie's death,
forget about Deverson's for the minute...

735
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,431
What do the forensics tell us?

736
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,515
- Yeah, angle of shot suggests he was awake.
- Right.

737
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,439
- Teeth weren't broken or burnt like Dev's.
- Right. What else?

738
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,789
Which means his mouth
was open for the gun.

739
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:42,430
Er... yeah, sorry. Er... no
sign of a struggle either.

740
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,396
Yeah, if it wasn't for the other death,
I'd have said he took his own life.

741
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,193
Here's me feeling so smug.

742
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,519
Because Deverson's death looked too
like a suicide to be a suicide,

743
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:02,315
I've only gone and assumed Budgie's was the
same because it looked so much like Dev's.

744
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,230
Budgie wanted us to arrest him.

745
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:09,716
To save him from himself.

746
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,471
Thanks, Billy.

747
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:27,796
So let's proceed on the assumption
that Budgie's death was not murder,

748
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,070
though that doesn't
rule out a connection.

749
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,236
All these lads were
members of the same unit,

750
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,636
close colleagues of Oliver Barton,
whose death they all witnessed.

751
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,992
Ma'am, computer forensics have recovered
Oliver Barton's deleted emails.

752
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,192
We might have our connection.

753
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,437
I'll see you in a minute.

754
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,198
What, you're not coming?

755
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,231
No, you go and charm her first.

756
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:05,836
I'm sorry that he killed himself,
but I didn't know him that well.

757
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,717
Dev didn't talk much about the others?

758
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,315
He said he had a private
self and a soldier self.

759
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,715
He thought he could switch one off
and the other on.

760
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,432
And when he was on tour?

761
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,838
No demands from us on his private self,
so he could be all soldier.

762
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,795
It must be difficult being away from each
other for such a long period of time.

763
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,831
Him not writing much.

764
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,911
You got into his email account?

765
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,191
He did still care about you, Laura.
He...

766
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,719
He was holding this picture...
when he died.

767
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,430
So much of my married
life I've been alone.

768
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:11,189
While Jim was off saving the world, I was
stuck in his house, in his barracks,

769
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,879
being father and mother to his kids.

770
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:20,230
And the funny thing is, I don't even
understand what we're doing there.

771
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:25,912
Afghanistan. It's their country. If they want to
live like that - killing and murdering, maiming...

772
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,515
So why do we have to go
and sort it out for them?

773
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,518
Why does my husband
have to go and sort it out for them?

774
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,630
You did get close to Ollie
Barton, didn't you?

775
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,073
Yeah. He knew what it was like for me.

776
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,111
And then it became something else?

777
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,800
Now, why didn't you tell
us this before, Laura?

778
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,752
Because it wasn't like that.
For me, at least.

779
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:03,910
You can't understand how trapped, how penned
in on every side I was, I am... I still am.

780
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:10,638
Between children and the army and Dev
and expectation...

781
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,396
And when Dev found out, what did he do?

782
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,514
He went round to Ollie's and threatened
him, threatened to kill him.

783
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,551
He had a gun. He kept
a gun in the house.

784
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:27,674
And they got into a fight.
The RMPs had to come and sort it out.

785
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,712
- They said they'd put him on a warning.
- It's not in the file.

786
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,788
He was their star-turn. Clearing
mines, saving lives, winning medals.

787
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,829
But then again, maybe Jim
just sorted it himself.

788
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,317
Like he sorted it for all the wives to have nothing
to do with me after. Like he sorted it for Ollie.

789
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:47,835
You think he knowingly
put Ollie's life in danger?

790
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:53,512
I don't know what to think, I just know
that Jim insisted Ollie went on that tour.

791
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,958
the little red hatchback,

792
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,911
that's your car, is it, pet?

793
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,712
Yeah.

794
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,991
Only I was talking to your neighbour,
Mrs Preston.

795
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,156
She's very observant.

796
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:17,353
She said your car was gone until the early
hours the night your husband was killed.

797
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,832
I went out, yeah.

798
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,440
Now, that's different
from what you told us before.

799
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:27,109
- I was with Alex.
- Alex Barton? Ollie's brother?

800
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,833
He'd found out about me and Ollie
from Ollie's emails,

801
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,429
and he wanted to ask me
if the family could use them

802
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,233
as evidence for an inquiry
into Ollie's death.

803
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:41,588
Evidence that your husband
had a motive to harm Ollie?

804
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,357
- And what did you tell them?
- How could I look my kids in the eye?

805
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,791
Turning against their father. I couldn't do that.
I couldn't do what they were asking me.

806
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,638
- They?
- Alex and Ollie's parents were there for a bit.

807
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,353
- And then they went to dinner.
- And you stayed with Alex?

808
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,709
We were just drinking wine
and remembering Ollie.

809
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:03,754
And I drank too much,
so Alex drove me home.

810
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,870
- In his car?
- In mine.

811
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,480
- What time was that?
- Midnight, just after.

812
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:12,035
- Then what?
- He got a cab and went home.

813
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,598
So?

814
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:26,236
Why would Alex clear his brother's emails
when he wanted Laura to go public with them?

815
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,555
Because she said no.

816
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,830
Because Dev was dead.

817
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,552
It only embarrasses her.

818
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,909
What, and he didn't
want to embarrass her?

819
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:44,871
Deverson puts Ollie in danger in Afghanistan,
getting him back for sleeping with his missus.

820
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,956
Ollie dies.

821
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,709
His soldiers support
his story because...?

822
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,832
Because Ollie had broken trust.
It's a code of honour.

823
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,348
Or maybe they don't all agree.

824
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,598
Vince Grafton thinks Dev
could be a mean bastard.

825
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,355
Maybe he thinks
that Dev would put him in danger.

826
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,109
Then Vince can't hack it when Dev gets his
Military Cross, knowing what's gone on.

827
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:11,790
Or maybe he's paying them back for endangering
him with their private squabbles.

828
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,956
Thinks women are trouble, doesn't he?

829
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:34,073
- You showed Laura this photo?
- Mm-hm.

830
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,680
- Did you tell her where we found it?
- Yeah.

831
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,675
- How did she take it?
- She was surprised,

832
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,392
given everything that's gone on.

833
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,911
Deverson was estranged from his wife
. She's had an affair with one of his mates.

834
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,676
Yet the night he dies,
he falls asleep clutching her picture...

835
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,872
- He still loves her?
- Or maybe the killer put it there.

836
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:58,799
- And where does the killer get it?
- The wall?

837
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,559
Not the sort of picture
you'd put on the wall, Joe.

838
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:07,879
You can leave that. Not the same
without something to dunk anyway.

839
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,198
Ma'am!

840
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,278
Come on!

841
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,312
Chief lnspector.

842
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,112
No-one in.

843
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:34,391
No, Alex is up at the hospital
and Keith's away with the shoot.

844
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,000
He won't be back till after dark.

845
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,390
Alex said you called yesterday as well.

846
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:45,514
Well, we're still trying to piece together exactly
what happened to your son in Afghanistan.

847
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,677
Does that mean there might be an inquiry
after all?

848
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:54,829
Oh, well, it's not for me to decide, pet,
but if we could uncover further evidence...

849
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,592
Can we talk?

850
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,637
It's very beautiful here, in't it?

851
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,716
Is it?

852
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,751
Yeah, I suppose it is.

853
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,790
I suppose I should count myself lucky
to live in such a place.

854
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,951
But I don't feel lucky.

855
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,754
I feel like I've given my whole life
in the service of this country.

856
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,274
First trailing after
Keith with the boys,

857
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,710
while he's posted to Germany and Ireland
and God knows where.

858
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:32,712
And then, when we finally come home
and make a home,

859
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,955
you know, a real home...

860
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,631
my...

861
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,351
my own little boy...

862
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,148
You know,
when I hear some boy's won a medal,

863
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,953
I think about his wife and his mother.

864
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,513
I think of all the tears that have
been shed in the winning of that medal.

865
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,519
Were you upset that Laura Deverson
wouldn't allow you

866
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,712
to use her affair with your son
as evidence to push for an inquiry?

867
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,751
No, I wasn't.

868
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,995
I don't condone her actions, but I
just thought it was unfair to ask her.

869
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,471
She's a soldier's wife...

870
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:30,951
and the lover of another
soldier, apparently. My son.

871
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,792
And I expect she's suffered greatly.

872
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,030
But your husband and Alex?

873
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,077
Oh, well, Keith wanted to go ahead
and make it public anyway.

874
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,032
And... Alex, I don't know.

875
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:50,996
And by the time I saw him the next day,
James Deverson was dead.

876
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:56,478
Did your husband discuss an inquiry with
Dominic Chapell at his house, after the dinner?

877
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,511
- Yeah, they talked, yeah.
- Yeah, and?

878
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,350
And Dominic said he couldn't help us.

879
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:12,912
Mrs Barton, Diana, I don't suppose
you have a hairbrush of Ollie's,

880
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,916
or a lock of hair?

881
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,598
For DNA.

882
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,236
No, I'm afraid...
I'm afraid I didn't keep a lock of hair.

883
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,078
Well, anything at all
that might have traces?

884
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,476
His army kit, perhaps.

885
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,556
No, I washed and mended his uniform.

886
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,071
I'm sorry, pet.

887
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,632
What about his teeth?

888
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:45,038
- Excuse me?
- His baby teeth. Do you still have them?

889
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,111
Thanks, Mrs Barton.

890
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,111
Right, I'm taking them
straight to the lab.

891
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:12,358
Get them to crosscheck those teeth
with the blood on the original of this.

892
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,789
Stand over them while they
do it, if you have to.

893
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,115
- Where are you going?
- Shep.

894
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:21,597
See if Laura Deverson's story's true
about Dev threatening Ollie with a gun

895
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:25,076
and, if so, why any report of it's
been removed from the file.

896
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:29,955
The keeping of soldiers' records is not
my responsibility, Chief Inspector.

897
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,438
Captain Shepherd has found you made
special pleadings to her predecessor

898
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:39,792
not to have the charge of affray
added to Dev's record.

899
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:45,797
It was a personal conflict, out of
character, no reflection on his soldiering.

900
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,832
Plus it would have reflected badly
on the regiment.

901
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,635
And there'd be no chance of him winning any
honours, let alone the Military Cross after that.

902
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,797
I did not think it was relevant
to your investigation.

903
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:01,391
It is not for you to decide what is or
is not relevant to my investigation.

904
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,557
Now, is there anything
else you have withheld?

905
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,878
Chief Inspector, you are meant to be
investigating the death of these two men.

906
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:13,038
Instead, you seem intent on questioning
military operation and procedure,

907
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:16,436
which lie beyond the range
of your jurisdiction or competence.

908
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,755
You're in no position
to question my competence.

909
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:23,872
Captain Shepherd, I must ask you
to resume charge of this investigation,

910
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,876
as I should have insisted
from the outset.

911
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,032
Now, if you don't mind.

912
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,833
I'm afraid I cannot comply
with this request, sir.

913
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,791
It is not a request, Captain.

914
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,753
Sir, you have no procedural authority
over RMP.

915
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,917
No, but you do have authority
over this investigation.

916
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,997
Under the Provost Martial's
ruling of 2009,

917
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:50,353
in all serious crime relating to the military in
the UK, the civilian police will take the lead.

918
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:52,629
Sir.

919
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,829
Hey, Shep, I hope that hasn't ruined
your chances of promotion.

920
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:08,113
Well, like CID, we're independent of the powers that be.
At least, that's the theory.

921
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:12,756
We've got our match. Two different blood
traces on the photo. Dev's and Ollie Barton's.

922
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,112
And I confirmed with Laura that she gave the
photo to Ollie before he went to Afghanistan.

923
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,833
- Ollie had it on him when he died.
- That's the motive.

924
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:23,270
Revenge for the death of
Oliver Barton in Helmand.

925
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:30,433
Now, the killer planted the photo on Deverson as
a sign, thinking that since Laura's his wife,

926
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,755
no-one but them's going
to see it as such.

927
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,590
Who had access to Ollie's
personal effects?

928
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:38,108
They would have been
returned to his family.

929
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,395
Let's pay a little
visit to the hospital.

930
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,400
We talked about Ollie,
mainly, and family.

931
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,837
Around midnight, I drove her in her car back
to her place, and then I got a cab home.

932
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,475
So you left your house with
Laura Deverson at midnight.

933
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,670
Arrived at her house at 1 am.

934
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,315
What time did you get home, Alex?

935
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,351
- Around 2:30.
- Took a detour?

936
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,359
- Stop by the barracks, settle an old score?
- No.

937
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,118
What, then?

938
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,116
I was waiting for the cab.

939
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,151
What did you do while you waiting?

940
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,552
Talked.

941
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,272
Talked?

942
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,992
Where?

943
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,951
Laura's car.

944
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,991
What about?

945
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,996
Ollie.

946
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,395
Eh, that's a lot of talking about Ollie.

947
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,516
- Nothing else?
- It's difficult.

948
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,596
It's complicated.

949
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,632
Aye, it would be, holding a torch
for big brother's girlfriend.

950
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,119
No.

951
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,913
It wasn't to protect Ollie's privacy
you wiped his emails.

952
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,428
It was to cover their
affair and your tracks.

953
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:21,437
I don't have to say anything, do I?
I don't have a lawyer present.

954
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,517
I haven't arrested you yet.
Would you prefer that?

955
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,393
- Joe...
- OK. OK.

956
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,716
It's because...

957
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,593
because I could see the whole thing
had caused her so much pain.

958
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:38,790
And after that night,
after hearing her side,

959
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,230
I thought my dad should just give up
looking for an inquiry.

960
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,794
It was your dad pushing
for the inquiry, was it?

961
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,637
And me.

962
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,398
But I was doing it for him.

963
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,679
After that night,
I thought it just prolonged the pain.

964
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,671
I told him, before he
left for the dinner.

965
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,314
And then when I heard
that Deverson was dead,

966
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,352
it just seemed cruel
to drag Laura through it again.

967
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,076
What about the photo of Laura?

968
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,078
- What photo?
- The one with Ollie's things from Afghanistan.

969
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,951
I've never seen it.

970
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,073
- Well, it would have been sent to his next of kin.
- I'm not his next of kin.

971
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,511
I don't care how long it takes,
I want every little detail, Joe.

972
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,516
And don't take any slaver from him.

973
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,551
You going to be all right on your own?

974
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,470
Kenny says that the
cab company confirmed

975
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,796
that a passenger was picked up
30am

976
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,355
and that they dropped off
around the Cadvar Estate around 2:30am.

977
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,595
So there is no way
they had time to take a detour

978
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,710
around the Otterford
Barracks in that time.

979
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,638
And Shep's checked,
there's no record of Alex Barton

980
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:01,753
- entering or leaving the camp by foot that night?
- No, none.

981
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,598
- What about Chapell?
- There's still no sign.

982
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,916
Well, get her to call him again.
I don't care if he's invading France.

983
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:11,919
If he's not with her in five minutes,
I'll have him arrested for obstruction.

984
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,712
Chief Inspector?

985
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,194
Which way was the hunt
headed, Mrs Barton?

986
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,231
Oh, it's at Cadvar Woods. Why?

987
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,271
Thanks, pet.

988
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,231
What's going on?

989
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,871
Mum?

990
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:41,956
I was in a meeting with military officials, Captain Shepherd.
What was it that couldn't wait?

991
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,797
The night that Deverson was murdered,

992
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,877
you invited the Bartons to your house
after the dinner at the hall.

993
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,832
It was more like Keith insisted.
He wanted to talk about his son.

994
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,997
- And how far is your house?
- 20 minutes by foot. Five minutes by car.

995
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,031
You drove? You took them in your car?

996
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,631
Could you show us?

997
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,993
- You said in the statements that they walked away at 1:45? - Yes.

998
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,713
Did they walk back from your house
to the car park?

999
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:31,198
Diana was tired. She was wearing heels.
Keith decided to go back for the car.

1000
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,555
- And would they pass by this way?
- It's one way they could have come.

1001
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,391
Is this the most direct way?

1002
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,431
Keith Barton!

1003
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,354
Mr Barton!

1004
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,391
How long was he gone?

1005
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,997
Hard to say. 20 minutes...

1006
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:14,114
Was it not more like half an hour or 40 minutes,
and that's why they were so late leaving?

1007
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,435
You and Barton go back
a long way, don't you?

1008
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:19,552
He was platoon sergeant on
your first tour, wasn't he?

1009
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,830
I've committed no crime, Sergeant.

1010
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:25,270
I was asked what time they left
and I have told you accurately.

1011
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,911
Gibbet.

1012
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,712
Where we hang the vermin.

1013
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,558
Scares others off.

1014
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:48,995
I know it's frowned on, but nature
doesn't operate by man's laws.

1015
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:53,470
Your father would have understood that.

1016
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,114
Put the gun down, Keith.

1017
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,634
I'd have done anything for them, my boys.

1018
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,951
Same as in the army.

1019
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:12,909
The only way a unit survives is by
standing together. Whatever it takes.

1020
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,716
Dad!

1021
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,117
Now it's all changed.

1022
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,151
All hearts and minds.

1023
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,190
Ollie and I disagreed on that.

1024
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:28,233
He thought you could reason with the
enemy, make them see you're right.

1025
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:35,632
But then he gave his heart to a woman,
and look what her husband did.

1026
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,918
He insisted on Ollie going
on that second tour.

1027
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,951
So he could fix him.

1028
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,031
So I fixed him.

1029
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,837
Natural law.

1030
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,471
Dad!

1031
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:57,112
Keith, don't! Don't!

1032
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,469
Do you think I'm going
to sit there and watch,

1033
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,717
while the murderer of my son
is awarded a medal for bravery?

1034
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,228
- Dad!
- Oh, so you took it, did you, Keith?

1035
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,350
- Dad, please!
- You took his Military Cross?

1036
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:11,188
I looked for it, but I expect
even he was ashamed to keep it.

1037
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:14,277
It is not your fault Ollie died.
Please don't do this.

1038
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,751
Stop!

1039
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:27,357
They say it's just a flesh wound.

1040
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,437
Like you said, it takes
guts to go through with it.

1041
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,032
It'll take more than guts
to live with what he's done.

1042
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:15,633
May God give you his
comfort and his peace.

1043
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:21,595
His light and his joy in
this world and the next.

1044
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:30,156
And the blessing of God Almighty,
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit

1045
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:33,351
be among you and remain with you always.

1046
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,998
- Amen.
- Amen.

1047
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,751
Vince.

1048
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,833
Look, I know it doesn't
compare, what we do.

1049
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:13,431
But what we're fighting for, both of us in our
own way, it's for more than just our mates.

1050
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:19,800
And though it's not always pretty,
we're both good at what we do.

1051
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:37,151
So you let him off the weapons charge?

1052
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:40,795
Yeah, on condition he has his
little mementos decommissioned.

1053
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,351
So, Shep, what's next for you?

1054
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:47,671
Oh, you know, 15k run,
see what's on my desk.

1055
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,391
Glutton for punishment, you!

1056
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,669
Still, if you're ever
looking for something,

1057
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:58,156
you know, when you're done
with your marching and your saluting,

1058
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,794
or if your senior officers
stand in your way...

1059
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:05,080
you look us up, hm?

1060
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,315
Hey, your garden is transformed.

1061
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,711
Well, had to be done.

1062
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:40,117
That shrub got so overgrown,
it kept banging on the window.

1063
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,357
Kept thinking it was Heathcliff
coming to take me away!

1064
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:48,594
- So where's this stuff you want moving?
- Ah. No bob-a-job today, pet.

1065
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:51,473
That was just a ploy
to get you over here.

1066
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,034
- Ta-dah!
- Look at that.

1067
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:58,153
Lunch. Return the compliment.

1068
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,111
Well, that's lovely, boss. But salad?

1069
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:03,152
Yeah, I know. The end of the world.

1070
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:11,757
Eh, come on, I'm feeling all demob happy,
as if I've made it through basic training.

1071
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:16,594
Eh, that's it. Come here.

1072
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,431
Where is he?

1073
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,351
Where are you?

1074
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,356
Give up.

1075
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,356
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

1076
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,391
- Come on, Jimmy!
- Come on, Jimmy!

1077
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,151
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

1078
01:28:00,209 --> 01:28:38,120

2
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,170
Matt!
Wake up.

3
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,400
- What time is it?
- Daytime.

4
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,490
Where's everybody else?

5
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,640
They bailed on us.

6
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,280
Come on.

7
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,400
My old man used to
bring us up here.

8
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,729
Said a mean old troll
lived in the caves.

9
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,820
Gave me nightmares for weeks.

10
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,280
Summat in there.

11
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,450
In the corner.

12
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,178
Looks like a person.

13
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:38,100
What, with the beady
eyes of a cave troll?

14
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,240
Do you see it?

15
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,080
Yeah.

16
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,590
It's just some bin bags.

"Tuesday's Child"
Season 6 - Episode 02

20
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,090
Good morning, Ma'am.

21
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,440
Is it?

22
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,599
Do you know this place?

23
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,050
Lovers' Corner.

24
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,909
Local uniform says
it's a hangout

25
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,739
for bored teenagers.
They come up here to party.

26
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,999
They've gotta go somewhere,
I suppose.

27
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,539
These the two lads
who found him?

28
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,819
Yeah. Richard Whenby
and Matthew Lansard.

29
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,419
- Were they up here partying?
- Yeah.

30
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,449
Look at the state of this.

31
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,040
More DNA here than Friday
night up Bigg Market.

32
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,099
IC1 male.

33
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,550
Late teens, early twenties.
Ma'am.

34
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,809
No ID.

35
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,970
- No phone?
- No phone. No wallet.

36
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,939
And he was dumped?

37
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,659
Wrapped up in bin bags?

38
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,850
Sealed tight,
just like a mummy.

39
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,830
The cold in the cave
slowed decomposition,

40
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,909
but judging from the discolouration
around the head and the neck here,

41
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,369
estimated time of death
some time Tuesday morning.

42
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,980
So two days?

43
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,819
He looks about the same age
as those lads who found him.

44
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,219
- Is he one of their mates?
- They say they don't know him.

45
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,309
What have you got
cause of death?

46
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,659
Blunt-force trauma
to the cranium.

47
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,730
Two fractures.
One on the crown, not so deep.

48
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,759
Another, deeper,
at the back of the skull.

49
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,699
So hit twice
over the head.

50
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,579
From behind. Also there's a minor
fracture on the bridge of the nose.

51
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,699
Is that from being punched
or falling face first?

52
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,749
I mean, there's dirt
around the nose and mouth.

53
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,110
So, probably the latter.

54
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,979
Unless there's any other
signs of a struggle?

55
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,830
There's some older cuts and
scratches on his hands but...

56
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,009
Why hasn't any
wildlife been at him?

57
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,669
He was wrapped up air-tight

58
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,219
until the lads came
and opened him up.

59
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,859
Whoever left him here
stuck him in the corner

60
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,219
where nothing
picked up his scent.

61
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,990
Yeah, well,
that's something, I suppose.

62
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,829
Now, there's dirt on
the back of his calves.

63
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,049
So probably dragged up here.

64
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,399
Have we checked the area?

65
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,979
First officers on
the scene walked it.

66
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,359
There are no obvious
drag marks or footprints.

67
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,220
The poor lad.

68
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,240
Marcus...

69
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,820
What's that?

70
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,739
Maybe he was wearing it.
Broke off when he was killed?

71
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,140
Or maybe the killer
was wearing it.

72
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,209
Or maybe the killer
left it on him.

73
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,250
Ma'am...
Can I show you something?

74
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,249
Ma'am.

75
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,039
Just wanted to say that...

76
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,300
thought you did really well
yesterday at Bethany's inquest.

77
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,799
I imagine...
I imagine it was difficult.

78
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,650
Well, we did our homework.

79
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,260
It was fine.

80
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,800
Thanks, Marcus.

81
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,070
So, not dumped here.

82
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,250
- Killed here.
- Let's get this sealed off.

83
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,060
Ma'am?

84
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,200
Well,
there's some loose topsoil.

85
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,219
Digging?

86
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,860
- Don't know.
- Maybe they got disturbed.

87
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,910
Yeah, maybe.

88
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,779
Marcus said last Tuesday.

89
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,619
Now, last Tuesday was cold,
wasn't it?

90
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,159
Frost. The ground would
have been too hard to dig

91
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,819
and if you needed
to hide a body,

92
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,150
that cave is as good
a place as any.

93
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,389
Premeditated, then?

94
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,259
Well, if the killer had
bin bags and duct tape.

95
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,910
Well, could've left the body
there, went back to the car.

96
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,150
Or nipped to B&Q.

97
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,360
Hello, lads.

98
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,880
DCI Vera Stanhope.

99
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,399
Now, you told my officer

100
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,479
you stayed up here last night?

101
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,570
- Yeah.
- On your own?

102
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,890
On our own.

103
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,659
- Where do you live?
- Corlington.

104
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,799
Corlington, well,
that's a fair few miles.

105
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,109
How'd you get up here?

106
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,110
- We walked.
- In a mate's car.

107
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,089
They're taking photos of
the tyre tracks, Rich.

108
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,590
They'll find out.

109
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,900
So, what, you up here partying,
were you?

110
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,579
Partying?
No.

111
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,079
Just a few mates, a few drinks.

112
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,189
Now, that lad in the cave.
I know you took a peek.

113
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,260
Are you sure you don't know him?

114
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,299
No, don't know him.

115
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,089
Right, well, I'm going to need the
names of your drinking buddies.

116
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,399
OK?

117
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,480
Can we get a lift
back to town after?

118
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,859
What?

119
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,529
- Do you reckon they're involved?
- If they are,

120
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,659
they'd be pretty
stupid to call it in.

121
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,619
We have a white male,

122
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,629
late teens to early twenties.

123
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,859
He suffered a blunt-force
trauma to the back of the head.

124
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,379
He was found wrapped in bin bags

125
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,499
in a cave up at Lovers' Corner.

126
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,579
Now, maybe they planned to bury
him, but the ground was too hard.

127
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,279
Don't know. And he was found
with a crucifix on him.

128
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,019
Where are we with ID?

129
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,639
He's not in the system.

130
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,999
Missing Persons came back empty.

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,019
Well,
check schools and colleges, too.

132
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,299
Any absentees
in the last two days.

133
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,279
- Will do.
- And what about the list of teens

134
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,589
up at Lovers' Corner?

135
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,259
We're having trouble
tracking them down.

136
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,889
It's a long list and the ones we've
spoken to are not volunteering much.

137
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,729
- Why not?
- Word's out there's a killer on the loose.

138
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,789
Don't tell me,
bloody social media?

139
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,459
Yeah, #caveman.

140
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,779
Now, which one of the
little toe-rags put that up?

141
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,080
- Matt.
- Matt.

142
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,699
Do you want me to get onto
cyber and get it deleted?

143
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,079
Nah, it'll be like
fighting a bushfire.

144
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,000
Just keep your eye on it.

145
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,260
So,
can we place anyone at the scene?

146
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,939
Any call-outs in the last week?
Disturbances?

147
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,139
Complaints from the locals?
Anything!

148
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,659
There's nobody about to complain.
It's in the middle of nowhere.

149
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,549
What? And we've got no
CCTV to look at? Great!

150
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,209
Nearest camera's a quarter of
a mile away, at the garage.

151
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,859
Ma'am,
Marcus just sent these over.

152
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,900
He said he found them in the front
pocket of the victim's jeans.

153
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,769
Looks like confetti?

154
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,759
Get onto the disgruntled brides,
Kenny.

155
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,080
- Your area.
- I've actually got a lot on.

156
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,779
Right, Ken.

157
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,459
What time you called?

158
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,039
They're saying three o'clock

159
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,539
but the clerk thinks
that it might run on.

160
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,179
- Can we get in some cover?
- No.

161
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,439
I'd rather wait until
Bethany's inquest is over.

162
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,779
- Why?
- Because the time it takes

163
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,579
to get a new person up to speed,
we'll have solved it.

164
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,589
So we carry on a man down?

165
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,720
- Just as normal?
- Exactly, Kenny.

166
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,950
Exactly.

167
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,910
This isn't confetti.

168
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,489
I think it's ticket stubs.

169
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,839
Or...
cinema ticket stubs.

170
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,850
Right.
All e-tickets now.

171
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,990
We got ENS...
ENS.

172
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,289
EVE...

173
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,450
- EVE... Evening?
- ENSEVE?

174
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,099
PEV...

175
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,859
PEVENS...

176
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,299
Pevens... Pevensey!

177
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,259
- Pevensey!
- What's that?

178
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,560
Pevensey...

179
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,560
The fair's in town.

180
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,750
Evening service tonight
at St Christopher's.

181
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,659
It's not the Pevensey
Fair I remember.

182
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,569
Never had you down
as a thrill-seeker.

183
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,299
Course, it was the Pevensey
Steam Fair back then.

184
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,530
Yeah? Was that
before we had electricity?

185
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,299
Go and check those caravans.
See if they recognise our lad.

186
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,400
I'll see if I can
find the manager.

187
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,509
- All right, love?
- Yes, thanks.

188
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,410
Bit tall for this ride,
aren't ya?

189
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,690
Is there a manager, pet,
or someone in charge?

190
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,560
Hello?

191
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,380
You all right?

192
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,250
Jodie Pevensey.

193
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,779
My...
My parents own the fair.

194
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,879
- Right.
- What seems to be the problem?

195
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,350
Do you recognise this lad at all?

196
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,739
Maybe he works for you?

197
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,899
Why erm... Why's it a drawing?
Is he wanted for summat?

198
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,420
You do know him, then?

199
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,289
Is he in trouble?

200
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,300
He was found dead
this morning, love.

201
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,949
His name's Jamie.

202
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,939
At least that's what he called
himself. Don't know his surname.

203
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,080
- Do you know where he was found?
- Up at Lovers' Corner. Do you know it?

204
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,560
Never heard of it.

205
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,950
And we've reason to
believe he was murdered.

206
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,450
And he worked for you?

207
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,109
Aye.
Since last summer.

208
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,349
- Does he have a next of kin?
- Sorry, I don't know.

209
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,299
Well, is there anything
at all you can tell me?

210
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,659
He was a good worker.
Always prompt.

211
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,019
- Was he a local lad?
- Aye, Geordie.

212
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,219
- So, do you have an address?
- He just stayed here.

213
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,889
- When did you last see him?
- Must've been Monday night.

214
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,280
- Packed his bags and moved on.
- He left?

215
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,940
Do you know where he went?

216
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,319
- What happened to you?
- It's all the fun of the fair.

217
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,909
Mr. Kirke was very kindly

218
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,459
showing me how he treats
outsiders, weren't you?

219
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,269
I thought he were nicking stuff.

220
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,169
Is it possible he could
have had a disagreement

221
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,779
with any of the other travellers?

222
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,099
We're not travellers.
We're show people.

223
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,859
This has been my family
business for four generations.

224
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,189
Nothing happens here
without me knowing about it.

225
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,890
And, no,
Jamie got on with everyone.

226
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,690
Well,
clearly not everyone.

227
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,240
Could you show me
where he was staying?

228
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,280
It's this one...

229
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,779
- And you both kip in here, d'you?
- Yeah. That was Jamie's bed.

230
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,100
Did he tell you he was leaving?

231
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,730
- Jamie's a quiet fella.
- Always the quiet ones.

232
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,639
He didn't seem like
he was in any trouble?

233
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,290
He didn't mention anything.

234
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,040
Did he have any visitors?
Girlfriend? Boyfriend?

235
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,680
No.

236
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,110
- This Jamie's?
- It isn't mine.

237
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,990
That's just around the corner.

238
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,670
Right,
I want the place searched.

239
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,479
I've got you a more
accurate time of death.

240
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,209
6am to 12pm,
Tuesday morning.

241
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,219
So a morning person,
our killer.

242
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,019
And I found something in the
wound. A fleck of black paint.

243
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,929
I've sent it off for analysis.
However,

244
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,459
the skull fractures
are concave.

245
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,239
So something angled
and heavy and black.

246
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,749
First blow knocked him out.

247
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,959
Fell onto his knees,
landed face down.

248
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,979
There was dirt in the airways,
so he was still alive.

249
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,519
- And the second blow...
- That finished him off?

250
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,689
- So, deliberate.
- Exactly.

251
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,220
What about that black plastic?
Anything on that?

252
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,109
Just dirt.

253
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,929
Any blood other than his?

254
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,879
Not in the cave or near it.

255
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,419
Let's think.

256
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,799
He goes up there,
have a few drinks with his mates,

257
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,029
fight breaks out and
someone lamps him one?

258
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,549
There's no alcohol in the blood.

259
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,179
Plus he had fairly
severe diabetes.

260
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,459
- Which type?
- One.

261
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,079
But, having said that...

262
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,499
overall, physically,
he was in really good shape.

263
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,739
There's no nicotine, no drugs.

264
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,720
Has nice togs.
He's healthy, he's well groomed.

265
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,429
So what's a clean-living,
Bible-reading lad

266
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,190
doing in an area notorious
for bad behaviour?

267
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,550
Looking to be corrupted?

268
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,750
<i>It's also a time for your friends
and your family to come together...</i>

269
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,869
<i>You might be a bit nervous</i>

270
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,890
<i>but you'll be surrounded
by friendly faces.</i>

271
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,349
<i>You'll be surprised
how much that helps.</i>

272
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,650
Yes.

273
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,860
I'll be there to walk you
through everything.

274
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,900
Kenny's back in the office.

275
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,339
He said they overran last night.

276
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,259
You know Bethany's
mum was there?

277
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,320
Not in a good way,
apparently.

278
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,450
Well.

279
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,500
It's over now.

280
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,690
This'll be you soon.
Walking down the aisle.

281
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,480
His name's Jamie Thorne.

282
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,179
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Yes.

283
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,380
So was he a member
of your church?

284
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,830
Oh. How do you know him, then?

285
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,269
He stayed with us last year.

286
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,679
Stayed in our spare room.

287
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,750
- He stayed with you?
- Last December.

288
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,119
I found him sleeping rough
in the doorway to the church,

289
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,259
so I offered him
a place to stay.

290
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,779
Well, we thought he was
staying at the fairground.

291
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,680
It had closed for the winter.

292
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,409
So how long was he with you?

293
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,680
Until it started up
again mid-January.

294
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,680
Have you seen him since?

295
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,389
Did you know him before?

296
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,779
No.
But he used to live in town.

297
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,379
He spoke of his mother
still being here.

298
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,270
Do you have an address,
love?

299
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,229
Jamie grew up in one of those
terraces on Tanner Street.

300
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,959
But his mother remarried.

301
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,419
She's still in Corlington,
though.

302
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,609
Grace...
Grace Marsh.

303
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,400
That's great, thank you.
I'll phone it in.

304
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,439
<i>If his mam's still local,</i>

305
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,850
<i>you'd think she'd take
him in at Christmas.</i>

306
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,259
<i>When Jamie's father died,</i>

307
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,910
<i>it was just him and his mum
for a long time.</i>

308
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,879
<i>I gather it was tough for them.</i>

309
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,030
<i>Single mum.
Not a lot of money.</i>

310
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,409
<i>When Jamie's mum remarried,</i>

311
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,710
<i>they moved.</i>

312
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,779
<i>Jamie spoke very fondly of his mother,
and his half-brother and sister.</i>

313
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,099
<i>It's strange that, then,
feeling he couldn't go back.</i>

314
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,550
<i>Jamie said it wasn't
really an option.</i>

315
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,399
Now,
we found this Bible in a caravan

316
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,089
he was staying
in at the fairground.

317
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,409
Was he religious at all?

318
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,260
When he stayed with us,
we discussed spiritual matters.

319
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,900
Do you take many young lads in?

320
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,179
No. I've tried to help
a few over the years,

321
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,680
though Jamie was
the only one that listened.

322
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,789
- And he never kept in touch?
- George...

323
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,299
This is the first I've heard
of him since he left us.

324
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,209
Mia said the police called.
What's going on?

325
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,099
My wife Amber.

326
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,729
Were you handing out flyers

327
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,679
at the fairground last night?

328
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,189
We go to most of the
events around here, yeah.

329
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,710
Trying to drum up some trade.

330
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,800
Did you ever happen to see
Jamie Thorne at the fairground?

331
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,600
Jamie? No.
Why?

332
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,080
I'll leave you to explain.
Thanks. Excuse me, love.

333
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,579
Have uniform been in
touch with the mother?

334
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,939
Yeah. She lives up in one of those
new builds on Carrington Drive.

335
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,579
Husband's big in construction.

336
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,390
Married well, then.

337
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,459
Well, let's get her in for
a formal identification.

338
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,769
What, immediately?

339
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,859
Might she not want to call someone,
or get her head round it?

340
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,759
Most people prefer us to just
get on with it, don't they?

341
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,060
I know I would.

342
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,190
Mrs. Marsh,
are you ready?

343
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,950
That's...
That's Jamie.

344
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,980
Can I get you anything?

345
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,699
Here you are, love.

346
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,719
I got you both a cup of tea.

347
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,020
Thank you.

348
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,720
Only...

349
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,839
I need to ask you some
questions about Jamie.

350
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,730
- Well, can't it wait?
- No, unfortunately, it can't.

351
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,210
- Grace?
- It's OK.

352
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,770
Did you and Jamie keep in touch?

353
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,200
Of course.

354
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,859
We... We'd text now and then...

355
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,140
and I spoke to him
about a month ago.

356
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,290
And when did he leave home?

357
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,650
July last year.

358
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,420
- Why did he leave?
- He got a job.

359
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,259
Oh, so there were no problems at
home, anything I should know about?

360
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,899
No, of course not.

361
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,240
He wasn't in any trouble
that you know of?

362
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,539
No.

363
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,509
Look, I'm sorry I have to ask.

364
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,630
Where were the both
of you Tuesday morning?

365
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,100
I was at work.
Grace was home with the kids.

366
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,420
Was this Jamie's?

367
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,819
I doubt it. He wasn't religious.

368
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,980
So do you know why he stayed with
the Reverend Haleford over Christmas?

369
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,750
Church just down
the road from you.

370
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,040
Oh... We... We thought
he was at the fairground.

371
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,499
- I thought you kept in touch.
- Yeah, we did.

372
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,969
It's just, you know,
the church is, what...

373
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,879
half a mile from your home

374
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,259
and he didn't even
call in to see you?

375
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,390
Not even for Christmas dinner?

376
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,110
We'd better get home.

377
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,459
My mother's looking
after the kids.

378
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,950
They'll be running her ragged.

379
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,260
CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE
THANK YOU

380
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,909
Ma'am, the fairground
shows up on the PNC.

381
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,339
All drug-related offences.

382
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,169
Dealing, possession.

383
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,519
Well, Jamie wasn't a user,

384
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
but he could've been
involved in dealing.

385
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,619
It says er... a
"Mr. Kirke subdued the assailant

386
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,179
- "until the police arrived."
- Kirke? Was that Harris Kirke?

387
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,059
He had a go at you,
didn't he, Aiden?

388
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,619
He tried.

389
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,889
Why didn't Jamie stay at
the fair for Christmas?

390
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,079
Cos, according to the vicar,
it closes.

391
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,789
Yep, come winter,
they pack up all the rides,

392
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,629
store them in an old depot
in Gateshead and go home.

393
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,939
The Pevenseys have a house there.

394
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,499
According to Jamie's bank, he made
a handful of cash withdrawals.

395
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,779
On average, one a week -
different days, different amounts.

396
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,700
But the last one was at 10:07
on Tuesday morning. £200.

397
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,190
He didn't have any cash on him.

398
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,139
- What bank is this?
- Private ATM machine

399
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,259
at a Snooker Hall in Corlington.

400
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,350
So, what was Jamie doing there?

401
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,360
Check it out.
Do the board.

402
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,019
According to his bank records,
he withdrew £200

403
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,950
from this machine,
just after ten, Tuesday morning.

404
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,399
I don't know. Maybe.

405
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,159
Could he have been
in here with someone?

406
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,460
Don't know.

407
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,650
What about your mate?
He might know something.

408
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,440
We're usually quiet
in here weekdays.

409
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,379
Police.

410
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,039
- All right, mate?
- All right.

411
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,230
Just wondered if you'd seen this
lad in here Tuesday morning.

412
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,650
No. Sorry.

413
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,369
Have another look.

414
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,600
Maybe you shot a few
frames with him.

415
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,240
- A quick 200 quid?
- Don't know what you're talking about.

416
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,630
That CCTV on the front doors...

417
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,100
Any chance I could have a look?

418
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,640
Suppose.

419
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,510
Is there another entrance?

420
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,720
Yeah.
At the back, from the car park.

421
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,400
- Maybe he used that.
- Does it have CCTV?

422
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,850
Have you definitely got the
right day? Tuesday morning.

423
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,800
Hey, hang on, hang on.

424
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,760
Back up a bit. Bit more.

425
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,120
And...
stop.

426
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,370
<i>When I came along, him
and his mum were pretty tight-knit.</i>

427
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,129
I tried my best.

428
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:16,980
- Well, it sounds like you didn't get on.
- Look, the lad never took to me.

429
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,019
I tried to include
him in things we did.

430
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,659
You know, as a family.
He wasn't interested.

431
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,919
Grace told him
he didn't need to do it.

432
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,659
Mums and their sons, eh?

433
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,269
Now,
your secretary told us

434
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,279
you wasn't in the office
Tuesday morning.

435
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,599
- So where were you?
- I was here.

436
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,099
- Presumably somebody here can verify that.
- The foreman. He'll back me up.

437
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,409
Back you up?

438
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,429
You two got an arrangement,
then, have you?

439
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,100
When you're off playing snooker,
he tells everyone you're here.

440
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,689
Only, your doppelganger
was in Corlington

441
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,559
snooker hall Tuesday morning.

442
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,539
Well,
I popped out for a few frames.

443
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,659
Left work for a few frames.

444
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,890
That snooker,
worse than drugs.

445
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,089
- Did you meet anyone there?
- Some mates that I play with.

446
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:58,079
- It's hardly a crime, is it?
- No, love.

447
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,689
But you told us you were at work,

448
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,259
so you can see why we're
a bit confused.

449
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,919
- I didn't think it was important.
- Did you meet Jamie there?

450
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,689
- No.
- It's just that Jamie

451
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,310
withdrew £200 from a cashpoint
there on Tuesday morning.

452
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,859
Bit of a coincidence that, don't
you think, him being there, an' all?

453
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,949
And after that,
we've got no trace of him,

454
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,519
until he turns up in a bin bag.

455
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,289
Me and Jamie might not have been
mates, but it's not like that.

456
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,349
I haven't seen or spoken
to him for months.

457
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,169
Haven't you?
Look at this.

458
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,379
This is a list of calls
from Jamie's mobile.

459
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,049
He called you six times.

460
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,669
Four times Monday evening

461
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,470
and twice on Tuesday morning.

462
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,659
- I don't know anything about this.
- No?

463
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,859
He left you a voicemail
which you deleted.

464
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,419
So I'll ask you again.

465
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,750
Did you meet Jamie on
Tuesday at the snooker hall?

466
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,290
Look, he wasn't there.

467
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,619
It's an old savings account that Grace
set up for him - he never used it.

468
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,929
I meant to close it,
but I didn't.

469
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,580
- You withdraw the money?
- Yes. Look, it's my money.

470
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,200
Why?

471
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,639
To cover his gambling
habit from his missus.

472
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,940
Am I right?

473
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,709
This is the phone
that Grace uses.

474
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,500
I just pay the bloody bill.

475
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,360
- Can I get you a coffee?
- No, thanks.

476
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,710
No. There's been a few developments
we'd like to ask you about.

477
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,499
Now, you said Jamie hadn't
been in touch recently.

478
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,819
Yeah.

479
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,680
Only, according to this...

480
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:46,250
he called you six times
in two days.

481
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,849
Just...
Just had some missed calls.

482
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,299
Yes,
which you just failed to mention.

483
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,119
- I forgot.
- You forgot? She forgot!

484
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,860
Only, on one of those calls,
Jamie left a voicemail.

485
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,419
- I never received that.
- Yes, you did,

486
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,939
because yesterday you erased it.

487
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,779
But luckily we've managed to
retrieve it from the server.

488
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,200
Do you wanna hear it?

489
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,719
<i>It's me.
Can you call me back?</i>

490
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,029
<i>I need to speak with you.</i>

491
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,899
<i>I'm in a bit of trouble.
I could do with somewhere to stay.</i>

492
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,750
<i>Just call me when you can.</i>

493
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,049
Now, Jamie left that voicemail

494
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,149
at 8:32am Tuesday morning,

495
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,909
the day he was killed.

496
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,869
And according to
the phone company,

497
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,379
you played it at 8:36am.

498
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,170
And then yesterday you erased it.
Why'd you do that?

499
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,259
What trouble was Jamie in?

500
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,560
I don't know.

501
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,539
But, whatever it was,
I didn't want him bringing it here.

502
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,829
But why did you erase it?

503
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,889
I didn't think he was being serious.
I thought he was messing.

504
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,259
Well, it doesn't sound like
he's messing to me, love.

505
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,209
- Does it you, DS Healy?
- Well, no.

506
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,159
He packed his bags,
Tuesday morning.

507
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,150
Did he turn up on your doorstep?

508
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,939
Didn't you go to the fairground?

509
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,459
- No.
- No.

510
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,549
Because you turned
your back on him.

511
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,059
Ma'am!

512
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,780
I know.
I know.

513
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,180
So... where's Jamie's photo?

514
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,889
That lad wanted to come home.

515
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,190
- Ma'am!
- What?

516
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,559
Why was that poor boy
homeless in December?

517
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,059
- Please...
- He asked if he could come home

518
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,990
- and you wouldn't let him!
- I didn't want him to come home!

519
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,409
I was just...

520
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:49,159
I was just trying to do
what was best for Jamie.

521
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,249
Me and Phil have built
a life here

522
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:54,299
and when it's me,
him and the kids, it just works.

523
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,700
But Jamie struggled
with the change.

524
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,340
He never liked Phil.
I don't know why.

525
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,599
I was trying to do
what was best for him.

526
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,449
- For all of us.
- Yeah?

527
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,470
Well, we're trying to find
who murdered your son.

528
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,300
Bloody wild-goose chase!

529
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,269
- What?
- Nothing, Ma'am.

530
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,299
Kenny,
<i>this better be good news.</i>

531
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,179
Well, we've narrowed down
the list of possible vehicles

532
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,780
matching the tyre tread
at Lovers' Corner...

533
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,499
.. and I think there's a...
potential lead.

534
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,419
Don't tell me.
The lads who found the body?

535
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,720
Not quite.

536
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,819
- Harris!
- Don't worry.

537
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,929
They just want to
ask a few questions.

538
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,210
Well,
why are they taking your car?

539
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,379
How'd you find out about Lovers'
Corner?

540
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,919
From the teenagers
at the fairground?

541
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,949
- What?
- They tell you about a party up there?

542
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,450
You've been there recently.
I'm just trying to work out why.

543
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,380
- I haven't been there.
- Are you sure about that?

544
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,499
You drive a Toyota Corolla.

545
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,019
Yeah.

546
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,980
Well,
has it gone missing recently?

547
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,869
Has it?
Do you lend it to anyone?

548
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,179
No.

549
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,139
It's just that we've found
tyre tracks at Lovers' Corner

550
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,590
that match your car.

551
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,580
So how did they get there?

552
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,939
- I don't know.
- Well, it's strange, that, isn't it?

553
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,609
Your car being very near
to where Jamie died.

554
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,809
And we've been unable to
find anyone at the fairground

555
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,779
who remembers seeing
you Tuesday morning.

556
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,079
I've never been
to Lovers' Corner.

557
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,450
Yet your car was there.

558
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,540
Ma'am...

559
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,250
What is it you're not telling us,
Mr. Kirke?

560
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,320
You have a little
think about that.

561
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,390
- Here.
- Ta.

562
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,690
Is Harris back?

563
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,540
- They're keeping him in.
- Why are you not there?

564
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,219
You should...

565
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,699
I don't know, put a good
word in for him or summat.

566
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,280
What will that do?

567
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,770
You don't think he did it,
do you?

568
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,579
Look, Jodie, I like Harris,
really I do, but...

569
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,299
.. he's with the police,
they've got his car...

570
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,990
It doesn't look good,
does it?

571
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,440
Jodie?

572
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,399
Ma'am, they've finished the
search of Harris Kirke's car.

573
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,699
Yeah, well,
tell me they've found something.

574
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,419
It hasn't been cleaned since it
rolled off the assembly line,

575
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,520
but they did find Jamie's
DNA on the steering wheel.

576
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,219
OK, so the lad drove
his car now and again.

577
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,409
Doesn't let Harris off
the hook now, does it?

578
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,839
Ma'am? CCTV from the
garage at Broadwell Road.

579
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,869
Jamie driving Harris's car

580
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:35,330
at 22:04 on Sunday evening.

581
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,819
Is there a passenger?

582
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,479
It's not clear enough to tell.

583
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,339
Ma'am, desk sergeant
says Jodie Pevensey

584
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,420
is here to see you.
She says it's important.

585
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,289
You wasn't in your caravan

586
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,539
Monday night or
Tuesday morning.

587
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,489
- I was.
- Well, Jodie Pevensey

588
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:57,299
has just told us
you were with her all night.

589
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,549
She said the pair of you were
in a hotel down the road.

590
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,159
You were together all night

591
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,850
and you returned to
the fairground at noon.

592
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,050
Is that true?

593
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,520
Is that true?

594
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,700
Yeah.
I was.

595
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,409
But Jamie had gone
when I got back.

596
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,910
- I didn't lie about that.
- Why didn't you tell us about the relationship before?

597
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,850
Jodie doesn't want
people knowing.

598
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,529
You'd rather have
a murder charge

599
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,539
than have Bobby Pevensey know
you're seeing his daughter?

600
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,179
It's not him.

601
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,579
It's her mum.
She's got it in for me.

602
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,639
Good enough to man the dodgems,

603
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,939
but not good enough
for her princess?

604
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,249
I love her.

605
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,860
Yeah, well, I think
you've proved that, Mr. Kirke.

606
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,680
Let him go.

607
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,099
The DNA test came back on the accreted
deposits on the back of the crucifix.

608
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,239
I ran it against
the DNA database.

609
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,419
It's not conclusive.
It's a mixed profile.

610
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,339
But there are striking similarities
to a name in the system.

611
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,400
Convictions for possession,
car theft, assault.

612
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,230
Mrs. Haleford?

613
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,019
- Caught me.
- Can we have a word?

614
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,029
Do you want me to fetch George?

615
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,260
No, you'll do just fine, love.

616
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,810
No...
we just wondered...

617
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,690
if you recognise this.

618
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:46,779
We bought one just like it
for my son, for his 18th.

619
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,399
- Can I take it out of the bag?
- No, I'm sorry, pet.

620
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,720
It's evidence.

621
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,750
- So where did you get it?
- We found it... on Jamie Thorne.

622
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,799
Mum. I'm just off out.

623
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,939
- I'll be over at Sally's.
- All right, love.

624
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,079
Take your phone and
don't be late back.

625
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,720
I'm sorry...

626
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,659
.. what are you saying?

627
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,500
We believe this to
be your Brendan's.

628
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,229
It has his DNA on it.

629
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,650
But...
But you found it on Jamie's body?

630
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,779
Any idea how he came
to have hold of it?

631
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,869
So may we talk to your son?
Is he in?

632
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,769
Brendan wouldn't have
anything to do with this.

633
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,880
No, just to eliminate
him from our inquiries.

634
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,259
I take it you've read his file?

635
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,990
I have, love.

636
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,390
He's easily led.

637
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,850
He just fell in with a bad crowd,
that's all.

638
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,950
Do you know where we
might find your son?

639
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,510
He moved out a while back.

640
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,309
Erm... Last time he called,
about a month ago,

641
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,419
- he was in London.
- Can I get an address?

642
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,129
He's never in the same place for very long.

643
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,619
Well, whatever you've got, love.

644
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,990
Excuse me.
Kenny?

645
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,829
Right. Well, thanks,
Mrs. Haleford.

646
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,949
- We will need that address.
- Yeah.

647
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:16,470
Jamie's mobile -
someone's just turned it back on.

648
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,829
Sherwood Road?
Where?

649
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,179
The corner of Thropton
Street and Sherwood Road.

650
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,480
Thropton...

651
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,249
Come on.
We're looking for anyone

652
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,939
resembling Brendan Haleford.

653
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,289
- Brendan Haleford?
- Well, you don't believe

654
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,450
what his mam said just now,
do yer?

655
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,970
Is that Thropton?
Thropton!

656
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,980
Kenny, we're here...
at Thropton.

657
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,570
He says they're on the move!
Back of Thropton.

658
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,320
What?
Court Street!

659
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,780
Round the front.

660
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,379
What you doing in our kitchen?

661
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,629
Hello, love.
Police.

662
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,180
DCI Vera Stanhope.

663
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,459
Well, if it isn't Mr. Hashtag!

664
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,379
- Where'd you get it?
- What?

665
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,689
The phone!

666
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,499
You said you got it on eBay!

667
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,890
- I found it.
- Tell her where you found it.

668
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,859
Only 20 quid.
Me and Rich split it.

669
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,419
- Did you take anything else?
- Just the phone and the wallet.

670
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,820
I don't suppose you took a back-up
before you wiped the phone?

671
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,830
No. I...
I didn't think.

672
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,939
Well, that lad might have
taken a photo of his killer.

673
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:43,479
- It was Rich's idea.
- Did you know Jamie?

674
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,780
No.

675
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,599
But I saw him a few
nights before.

676
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,050
Where'd you see him?

677
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,289
Lovers' Corner.

678
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,859
On Sunday night,
me and Rich were up there.

679
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,339
- What time?
- About ten... eleven.

680
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,419
He arrived in this old car and
went wandering into the woods.

681
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,859
- Was he on his own?
- Yeah.

682
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,739
- Did you talk to him?
- No.

683
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:15,320
We shouted out, but...
he just ignored us.

684
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,129
Bit of a weirdo, to be honest.

685
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,850
- Definitely Sunday night?
- Not Monday?

686
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,699
Sunday.

687
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,399
Why didn't you tell us before?

688
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,310
Promised Rich I wouldn't.

689
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,060
He said never help the police.

690
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:37,000
- Who's upstairs?
- No-one.

691
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,139
Hello, pet.

692
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,490
Thought you were
visiting your mate Sally.

693
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,259
Right, charge him with
obstruction of justice.

694
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,580
What?
You're joking!

695
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,530
How do you know Mr. Hashtag,
then?

696
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,079
He's a right catch.

697
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,010
No wonder you kept him quiet.

698
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,689
You and him go up to Lovers'
Corner together?

699
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:36,200
Not my scene.

700
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,139
What about Jamie Thorne?

701
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,219
Definitely not his scene.

702
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,090
Did your brother
and Jamie get on?

703
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,810
- They never met.
- What?

704
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,780
Brendon already
moved out by then.

705
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,449
Do you keep in contact with him?

706
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:55,820
He's down in London.
He don't really keep in touch.

707
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,760
I bet your parents miss him.

708
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:02,059
My parents like to talk
about love and forgiveness,

709
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,100
but when it comes to Brendon
they struggle to apply it.

710
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,259
Where were you
Tuesday morning?

711
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,230
With my mum,
handing out leaflets.

712
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,739
Ma'am, uniform have completed
the search of the fairground.

713
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,569
SOCOs haven't found any
DNA on any of the tools.

714
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:53,229
Did you show Brendan
Haleford's mugshot about?

715
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,130
Yeah. No-one can place him.

716
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,459
There's no evidence he
was in Jamie's caravan.

717
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,850
We checked for prints.

718
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,329
OK.

719
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,139
You can tell Mr. Pevensey
he can reopen.

720
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,509
Will do.
See you in the morning, then.

721
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:09,810
Night.

722
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,539
Whatever it is, Mark...
leave it till tomorrow.

723
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,179
I've just got the transcript
of my evidence.

724
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,580
Aye, you did well.

725
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,000
Do you think...
Well...

726
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,419
Are they gonna say
it was my fault?

727
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,359
Well,
why are they gonna say that?

728
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,310
Because I left her?

729
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,379
Now, listen.

730
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,379
This is going to sound hard-hearted
but it's not meant to be.

731
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,109
It was Bethany's decision

732
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,019
to be alone with a
person she thought

733
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,579
was a bereaved relative.
Not yours.

734
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,800
Hers.
That's... unambiguous.

735
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,499
Now,
that's not to say I blame her,

736
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,009
because the only person
to blame for her death

737
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:03,749
is the man who killed her,

738
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:07,159
and that's the truth of
what happened, isn't it?

739
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,170
She told you to leave.

740
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,259
Well, I suppose so. It's...

741
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:15,659
Well, it's just I can't help
thinking, "What if I'd stayed?"

742
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,419
Well,
then I'd be two good officers

743
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,079
down instead of one,
wouldn't I?

744
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,670
Then where would I be?

745
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,980
Now go home, Mark.
Good night.

746
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,060
Good night, was it?

747
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,600
Did you sleep in them clothes?

748
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,699
Look, Charlie made
me sleep on the sofa.

749
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,599
I'm not supposed to drink
because she can't. Why so early?

750
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,779
Look,
we've got this all wrong.

751
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,969
- Look, there's some mints in there.
- Wrong how?

752
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:44,410
The paint analysis on the head
wound came back. Have a look.

753
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,399
"As commonly seen
on garden tools."

754
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,899
Now, that got me thinking...

755
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,699
That lad, Mr. Hashtag,

756
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,289
he said he saw Jamie up at
Lovers' Corner on Sunday night.

757
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,599
Right?
So,

758
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,859
why was Jamie up at Lovers'
Corner on his own on Sunday

759
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,800
and then ended up there
again on Tuesday morning?

760
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,499
- I think he was looking for something.
- Something we missed.

761
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,799
Now,
that upturned earth by the caves.

762
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,369
What if that wasn't the
killer trying to bury Jamie,

763
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:15,340
but Jamie wanting
to dig something up?

764
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,550
There's nothing.

765
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,580
Well, keep digging.

766
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,760
- I'm gonna do my back in.
- Aiden...

767
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,550
.. get out of the hole.

768
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,009
It's a young adult male.

769
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:16,760
I'd place him at late teens,
early twenties.

770
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,200
How long's he been there?

771
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,859
12 to 14 months,
best guess.

772
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,969
Dogs haven't found anything.
Want to widen the search?

773
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,279
No. No.

774
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,339
Is there anything to suggest that
anyone's tried to dig this up before?

775
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,439
The topsoil was loose.

776
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,510
I think Jamie came up
here to find this grave.

777
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,819
He found it and
intended to dig it up.

778
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,389
But somebody stopped him.

779
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:41,820
Marcus?

780
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,260
It's Brendan Haleford.

781
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,150
Brendan didn't really move out.
He just...

782
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,190
stopped coming home.

783
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,339
He was hardly ever here.

784
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,190
Sometimes we wouldn't see
him for a week, maybe longer.

785
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,790
Are you sure it's him?

786
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,499
We've yet to make a
formal identification,

787
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,939
but his wallet was
found at the site.

788
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,709
But, Mum,
you said you spoke to him.

789
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:30,270
We have to ask why
you told us that.

790
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,830
You were implying that Brendan had
something to do with Jamie's murder.

791
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,809
I couldn't have
you thinking that.

792
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:39,250
God, I feel sick.

793
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,089
How long has the
body been there?

794
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:46,380
We think...
just over a year.

795
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,569
And Jamie and Brendan
didn't know each other?

796
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:53,790
No. Brendan left before
Jamie stayed here.

797
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,399
Do you know of any
connection between Brendan

798
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,659
and the Pevensey
fairground?

799
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,399
Do you think they had
something to do with this?

800
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,199
Not necessarily, no.
I'm just trying to establish

801
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,390
if there was a connection
between Brendan and Jamie.

802
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,409
What about you, pet?

803
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:15,190
Pevensey's daughter's
about the same age as you.

804
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:19,330
No. I don't hang out
with fairground girls.

805
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,670
So,
when did you last hear from him?

806
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,429
I don't remember.
Last summer?

807
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:32,409
June, I think.

808
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,819
Right.

809
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,390
You don't remember?

810
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,660
It was April 12th last year.

811
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,729
You told him that he
was an embarrassment

812
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:45,250
and Brendan decided he'd
had enough, he was leaving.

813
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,580
I remember.

814
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,260
April, then.

815
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,200
It was April.

816
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:12,929
Low-template DNA results
will take a day to come back.

817
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:17,009
I ran the dental records
and I have a reliable match.

818
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:19,979
These are definitely the
remains of Brendan Haleford.

819
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,299
Any connection between
the two murders?

820
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,309
Also wrapped up in
black plastic bin bags,

821
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:25,659
same as Jamie Thorne.

822
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:29,359
And cause of death was also a fatal
blow to the back of the skull.

823
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,779
Same as Jamie Thorne.

824
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,730
But this one has a
depressed fracture.

825
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,909
Someone hit him with
considerable force,

826
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:40,339
enough to cause fractures
toward the front of the skull.

827
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,199
So our killer has one
hell of a backhand.

828
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,500
Yeah.

829
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,700
- Where are you going?
- Just out.

830
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,920
- I can't stay here.
- Mia!

831
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,640
Mia!

832
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:21,180
The Halefords hadn't spoken
to their son in over a year.

833
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,989
Can't give us the names
of any of his friends

834
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:26,120
or account
for his whereabouts.

835
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:32,019
We know Brendan had a fractious
relationship with his dad.

836
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:35,939
And in the last week,
we've found the bodies of Brendan

837
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,400
and the lad who stayed
with them at Christmas.

838
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:41,769
Plus,
Brendan's crucifix

839
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:43,480
was found on Jamie's body.

840
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,500
How did that get there?

841
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,150
You not going to eat that?

842
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,140
No,
think I'm done.

843
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,209
Wasn't exactly a saint,
though, was he?

844
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:01,369
Maybe Brendan pushed
his dad too far.

845
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:03,959
Yeah, but how far would he
have to push him to do that?

846
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,609
Your own son.

847
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,690
Ask me in another 18 years.

848
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,419
So what couldn't wait?

849
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,970
Well, there was an allegation made
against George Haleford.

850
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,219
Cheers. They moved to
Corlington parish last year.

851
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,279
But in 2012,
when they were in Sunderland,

852
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,749
he was questioned over
the alleged sexual assault

853
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,860
of a 14-year-old boy
named Patrick McKellard.

854
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,599
- Was this pursued?
- No.

855
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,789
It's marked up
as NFA by DS Webb.

856
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,659
He's pretty emphatic
that it was vexatious.

857
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,969
There were big inaccuracies
in the boy's account

858
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:41,219
and the allegation was
dropped pretty swiftly.

859
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:44,029
Still, that's a big thing
for a kid to make up.

860
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:47,109
Webb's impression was the kid's
father was causing trouble.

861
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:50,670
Well, whichever it was,
we can't ignore it.

862
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,360
<i>His phone's gone
straight to voicemail.</i>

863
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,429
It's me. Can you call
me as soon as you get this?

864
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:02,350
The police are here.
They're looking for you.

865
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,450
He went out about an hour ago.
He can't have gone far.

866
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:13,299
- Is this about Brendan?
- Not quite, pet.

867
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,700
We need to ask you
both some questions.

868
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,050
About Patrick McKellard.

869
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,740
You'd better come in.

870
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,719
- Have you spoken to Patrick?
- Not yet. Should we?

871
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,749
I'd rather you didn't. The whole
thing nearly ruined our lives.

872
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:40,000
Do you want to tell
us what happened?

873
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,700
George was just trying
to help the lad.

874
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,310
We knew his family.
They came to the church.

875
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:56,210
Father had a few problems.
Always down the pub.

876
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,119
Patrick'd come home from school
sometimes, find himself locked out,

877
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,990
he'd come to the church.

878
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:06,079
On a few occasions, George
brought him home, you know.

879
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,189
Made sure he was all right
until his parents got back.

880
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,349
But then his dad got the
wrong end of the stick,

881
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:12,659
started...

882
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:16,390
accusing George
of ulterior motives.

883
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,250
Then his dad went to the police.

884
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:22,619
Anyway, when the detective
questioned Patrick,

885
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,279
he broke down,
said nothing had happened.

886
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,940
It was thrown out.

887
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,540
Did Jamie know about this?
About Patrick?

888
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,300
We came here to
get away from it.

889
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:40,210
Look, I'm sorry, love.

890
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,580
But I've got two dead lads, both
with links to this household.

891
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,759
And now this allegation
has surfaced.

892
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,219
Erroneous or not,
I need to be sure.

893
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,199
- What's this?
- It's a warrant

894
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,110
to search your home.
Aiden.

895
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:09,950
What's going on?

896
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,339
They think your dad's got something
to do with Brendan and Jamie.

897
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:16,180
I'm sorry, love.
It's just a line of inquiry.

898
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:19,610
Now, could you try
calling him again, please?

899
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,519
It's going to voicemail.

900
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,820
Ma'am?

901
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,950
- What is it?
- Found it in the wheelie bin.

902
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,500
Well, open it up.

903
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:02,130
Male clothes.

904
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:09,009
Deodorant, phone charger,
playing cards.

905
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,390
Any ID?

906
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:14,330
- That's not ours.
- Could that be Jamie Thorne's?

907
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,800
Yeah?

908
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,190
OK.
Where?

909
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,379
Thanks. We've got a
sighting of our vicar.

910
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,930
Bag these up.

911
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,780
Bobby Pevensey!

912
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,590
Yes, mate, how can I help?

913
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,839
- I've lost my son.
- Right, well, keep calm.

914
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,449
It happens all the time.
We'll find him.

915
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:35,009
First we can do
is make an announcement.

916
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:37,579
So if you give us a
description or a name...

917
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:40,200
- Is that meant to be some kind of joke?
- I'm sorry?

918
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:43,690
I know you.

919
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:48,380
Jamie spoke about you.

920
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,870
He looked up to you.

921
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:56,580
He told me you didn't tolerate
having druggies on your site.

922
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,809
You sometimes...
took the law into your own hands.

923
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:02,319
I think he was exaggerating.

924
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,940
My son's name was Brendan.

925
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,520
He was 22.

926
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,600
6'1",
spoke with a slight stammer.

927
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,699
Call the police.

928
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,050
They found his
body this morning.

929
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,480
There wasn't enough of him
left for me to identify.

930
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,980
- Did you know him?
- I'm sorry, mate. No.

931
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,579
Tell me what happened to my son.

932
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,899
I don't know.

933
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,040
He used to hang around here,
him and his druggie mates.

934
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,680
You need to steady down now,
mate, OK?

935
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,170
What did you do to him?

936
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,410
What did you do to my son?

937
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,520
Harris.

938
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,569
Harris, it's my dad. I need
you to come and sort him out.

939
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:55,589
Listen... sir, I'm sorry
for your loss, I really am.

940
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:59,390
But you've got the wrong man and I
really need you to calm down now.

941
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,859
I want you to tell me

942
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,569
- what happened to my son.
- Dad?

943
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:10,459
Just go home.
You've got the wrong man.

944
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,150
Well, do something, then.

945
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:16,980
Excuse me.

946
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:19,590
Bobby, no!

947
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,499
- Hey, I need you to stay calm.
- I am calm.

948
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,459
- Mr. Haleford?
- Is he all right? I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

949
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:28,710
- Just walk away, Mr. Pevensey.
- Mr. Haleford?

950
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,150
Come on, this way.

951
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:55,430
So, what were you doing
at the fairground?

952
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,939
I wanted to ask about Brendan.

953
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:00,190
Looked like you were
trying to start a fight.

954
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:07,219
- I'm not wanting to press charges.
- Well, that's just as well.

955
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:10,550
You've got two witnesses sat here
saw you throw the first punch.

956
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,909
You said you were
looking at the Pevenseys.

957
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:18,319
I just wanted to ask that fairground
owner

958
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,400
whether he knew Brendan.

959
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,480
And did he?

960
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:28,310
The holdall we
found in your bin...

961
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,539
.. any idea who that belongs to?

962
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:33,840
Holdall?

963
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,309
- What holdall?
- We found a bag

964
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:39,400
at your vicarage that we believe
contains Jamie's belongings.

965
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:41,800
How did that get there?

966
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,300
I've no idea what
you're talking about.

967
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:55,200
You think I had something to
do with what happened to Jamie?

968
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,680
I don't believe this.

969
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,500
I liked Jamie.

970
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,750
And I wouldn't ever
hurt my own son.

971
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,300
I've spent the last year...

972
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:23,180
.. praying for Brendan
to come home... just...

973
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:28,980
.. and he's been lying
there all this time...

974
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,420
.. on his own.

975
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:38,650
The holdall in your bin,
George.

976
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:41,400
Who does it belong to?

977
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:48,310
Like I said...
I don't know.

978
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:55,140
I think I'd like to speak
to my solicitor now, please.

979
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:05,659
Sleep well?

980
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,539
I don't even know
why I'm still here.

981
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,409
You tried to break
a vicar's nose.

982
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:12,419
Well, if a man can't take a
punch, he shouldn't throw one.

983
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:14,290
Come on.
You're free to go.

984
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:22,700
It's been a while since Morv
collected me from the cells.

985
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,950
Whoever said romance is dead?

986
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,999
Sorry, love.
Just saw red, you know?

987
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,550
It's all right. They're keen
on getting us for something.

988
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:43,869
- I had a call.
- Er... yes. Thanks for coming in, love.

989
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:45,370
Do you wanna come up?

990
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,520
Have you made any arrests yet?

991
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,980
It's...
It's ongoing.

992
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:06,410
We found Jamie's
fingerprints on these items.

993
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,310
Do you recognise
any of them at all?

994
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:20,400
I bought these for him
for his last birthday...

995
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:25,150
.. just before he left home.

996
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:39,300
When he was little, he used to
hate having his injections...

997
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:43,199
.. so I used to read to him,

998
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,900
take his mind off it.

999
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:49,449
Where did you find all this?

1000
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:51,330
Here. I'm sorry, love.

1001
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,699
I can't tell you that...
yet.

1002
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:58,400
But I'll make sure all his
belongings are returned to you.

1003
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:06,710
We did find this in his wallet.

1004
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,860
Thank you.

1005
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,600
Injections...

1006
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:29,130
- Insulin?
- Yeah.

1007
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:35,650
Where's his insulin?

1008
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,680
Kenny.

1009
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:43,259
That caravan that Jamie
shared with Harris Kirke.

1010
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:45,950
Did you find any insulin
medication in there?

1011
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:54,159
Yeah...
Two boxes in the bathroom.

1012
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,659
- Did you ask Harris about that?
- He said they were his.

1013
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:59,220
Yeah, but did you check?

1014
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:02,200
Did you check?

1015
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,980
Kirke.
K-I-R-K-E.

1016
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:14,080
OK.
Thanks, love.

1017
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:19,079
Harris Kirke has no need
for insulin. It was Jamie's.

1018
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,239
Now, why would that lad

1019
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,979
pack his bag without
the one thing

1020
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:24,750
he desperately needed?

1021
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,359
Kirke packed that bag,

1022
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,399
to make it look
like Jamie had left.

1023
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,619
Wait till you see this.
I checked the names of boys

1024
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:34,100
in Brendan's year at school.
One name stands out.

1025
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,739
Brendan went to school
with Harris Kirke?

1026
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,540
But Jodie gave Harris an alibi.

1027
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,170
- Yeah. Got it?
- Aye, got it.

1028
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,400
Won't be a minute.

1029
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,979
Right, check out the caravan.

1030
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:01,769
- Back so soon, eh?
- We're looking for Harris.

1031
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,939
We need to talk to
him and your daughter.

1032
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:06,349
Well, Harris should be over
there packing up his ride.

1033
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:08,200
Why do you need to speak
to my daughter?

1034
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,310
- Excuse me!
- Look in the helter skelter.

1035
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:15,680
No-one, Ma'am.

1036
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:20,180
It's empty. All his gear's gone.

1037
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:32,199
- You seen Jodie?
- Yeah.

1038
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,459
Her and Harris went to
the cash and carry. Why?

1039
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:37,259
- Their stuff's gone.
- Perhaps they're at the house.

1040
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:40,659
I want an all-ports Jodie
Pevensey and Harris Kirke.

1041
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,530
I want them found.

1042
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,000
- Come on!
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

1043
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,679
Harris?

1044
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,100
- Don't do anything stupid.
- I haven't done anything!

1045
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:32,339
Now, when we showed you a
photo of Brendan Haleford,

1046
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:36,009
- you denied ever having seen him before.
- Yeah.

1047
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:40,040
Only, according to your old
secondary school in Sunderland...

1048
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,900
- .. you and he were in the same class.
- School?

1049
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:47,659
That was, like, eight years ago.

1050
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:49,359
I don't remember
everyone from school.

1051
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,620
But how did he end up here?

1052
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,269
- I don't want to look at that.
- Did you bury Brendan here?

1053
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:59,450
No. I had nothing
to do with this.

1054
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,170
Why were you both running away?

1055
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,210
I don't know.
We just wanted to be together.

1056
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,129
I'm sick of my mum
trying to break us up.

1057
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,850
Was that the only reason?

1058
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,780
Yeah.

1059
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,979
- Does Harris love you?
- Yeah, of course he does.

1060
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:25,800
So you don't have any secrets?

1061
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,109
No. None.

1062
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,410
Good.

1063
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,469
So,
let's talk about what happened

1064
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:37,550
to your old bunkmate
Jamie Thorne.

1065
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:44,359
I don't know anything about that.
Jodie told you where I was.

1066
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,440
My mistake, pet, so she did.

1067
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,180
Sorry.

1068
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,739
So let's go back to Brendan.

1069
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:57,930
Here's what I think happened.

1070
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:03,270
12th April last year,
Brendan storms out of his home

1071
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:06,779
and lo and behold,
he turns up at the funfair

1072
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,709
and your paths crossed.

1073
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:11,159
- No.
- And on that same evening,

1074
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,909
12th April,

1075
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:16,589
you were admitted
to Newcastle A&E

1076
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:18,550
with a broken arm.

1077
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,980
Yeah, so?

1078
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,850
- How did you break your arm?
- I fell over at the fairground.

1079
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:30,399
Only, funnily enough,
round about the same time,

1080
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,689
Brendan had his head caved in.

1081
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:35,039
So did the pair of
you have a fight?

1082
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,869
He turns up at the fairground.

1083
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:40,419
You think he's gonna do your caravan
over and you whacked him one?

1084
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:41,729
No!

1085
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:43,780
So did you whack
him a bit too hard?

1086
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,159
- You killed him.
- No.

1087
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,619
You don't remember when
Harris broke his arm?

1088
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:50,280
Well, yeah, of course I do.

1089
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,550
And what did he say happened?

1090
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,170
I can't remember.

1091
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,319
I think he said
him and his mate

1092
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,450
were messing about on a
ride and they fell off.

1093
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,450
That mate...

1094
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,700
Was it him?

1095
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,340
Don't know.

1096
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,879
You panicked.

1097
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,280
You took him up to Lovers'
Corner and you buried him.

1098
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,159
And what about Jodie?
Was she in on all this with you?

1099
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,860
No. She had nothing
to do with any of it.

1100
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,380
Nothing to do with what, pet?

1101
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,369
Hello? You've got my daughter -
Jodie Pevensey.

1102
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:51,920
I want to see her. I need
to speak to her now, please.

1103
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,090
Brendan did come to the fair.
But it wasn't like you said.

1104
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,650
I'd not seen him since school.

1105
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:07,480
We had a few beers...
a bit of a smoke.

1106
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,069
He asked if he could
stay at mine...

1107
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:14,150
Said he had a run-in with
his old man or summat.

1108
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,980
He...

1109
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,170
He started climbing
up one of the rides.

1110
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,780
I climbed up after him.

1111
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,560
It was raining and... slippery.

1112
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,170
He fell first.

1113
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:40,150
Took me down with him.

1114
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,480
I hit the grass, broke my arm.

1115
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,510
But Brendan hit the
ride's platform...

1116
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,450
He wasn't moving.
He...

1117
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:04,130
Well,
why didn't you shout for help?

1118
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,599
You weren't responsible
for what happened.

1119
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,450
Why cover it up?

1120
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,439
Did someone pressure you?

1121
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,440
No. I just...

1122
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,430
I wasn't thinking.
I just... I panicked.

1123
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:26,699
I thought no-one had seen
me with him so I just...

1124
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:28,859
.. I put his body in my car,

1125
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:31,710
drove him up to Lovers'
Corner and buried him there.

1126
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,560
And, on Sunday,
did you tell Jamie all this?

1127
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:42,960
He came into the caravan.
I'd had a few...

1128
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,659
He started asking
about the crucifix

1129
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:48,510
I had hanging above my bed.

1130
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,380
It wasn't mine.
It was Brendan's.

1131
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:56,670
I took it off his body -
not to steal it, just...

1132
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:01,200
I dunno...
to remember him.

1133
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:07,620
And Jamie said how he
wanted one for himself.

1134
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,180
So I gave it to him.

1135
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,440
And he was... He was so pleased.

1136
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,200
Then it all just
started pouring out.

1137
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,270
I told him everything.

1138
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,560
And then what?

1139
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:35,000
You sobered up and realised you
shouldn't have told him anything?

1140
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,100
Jamie didn't
deserve any of this.

1141
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:45,710
Well, we can agree on that,
at least.

1142
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:51,640
There's just one thing
bothers me about all this.

1143
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:56,820
When Brendan died -
and I believe you about that...

1144
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,639
.. you carried his
body to your car.

1145
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,909
You drove up to Lovers'
Corner and you buried him.

1146
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:05,210
Is that right?

1147
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,890
How'd you do all that
with a broken arm?

1148
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,800
We may need to call you back in.

1149
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:31,300
You all right?
Thank God.

1150
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:36,279
- Do you know anything about Harris?
- I think he's still in there.

1151
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,980
Mr. Pevensey!

1152
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:41,140
I'm sorry, love.

1153
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,519
When Harris broke
his arm last April,

1154
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,409
- how did he get to hospital?
- Hang on. Why?

1155
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:50,069
- Did you drive him, love?
- No.

1156
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:51,409
Then who did?

1157
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:54,019
He knocked on our door,
said he'd had an accident,

1158
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:56,649
- so Morven drove him in.
- And Tuesday morning...

1159
01:18:56,650 --> 01:18:59,719
Did you see your wife
on Tuesday morning?

1160
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,099
I was at the site office.
She was around.

1161
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,940
Did you see her?

1162
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:13,020
Mrs. Pevensey.

1163
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,239
You and Harris...

1164
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:19,059
you share quite the secret,
don't you?

1165
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:21,670
We'd like to ask
you some questions.

1166
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,529
About?

1167
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:26,650
I think you'd better
talk to them, love.

1168
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,350
After you, pet.

1169
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,959
We know Harris had an accomplice

1170
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,670
the night Brendan died. Now,
if it wasn't you, who was it?

1171
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,109
Or have we got this all wrong

1172
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:09,510
and Harris really is the world's
best one-armed grave-digger?

1173
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:14,189
I took Harris to the hospital
that night.

1174
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:15,490
That's all.

1175
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:20,719
Didn't see Brendan's body
lying around anywhere?

1176
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,020
No?

1177
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,320
Did Harris tell you anything?

1178
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,979
Look, if you don't
start talking soon, pet,

1179
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:33,239
I'm gonna take your lovely
fairground

1180
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,249
apart piece by piece,

1181
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:39,459
and then your house and then
your car, until I find something.

1182
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:42,879
And then I'm gonna bring your daughter
back in and then your husband,

1183
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,419
and I won't stop
until I can tell

1184
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:47,499
Reverend Haleford
and Grace Marsh

1185
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,750
what happened to their lads.

1186
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,719
No?
All right!

1187
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:03,220
The night that Brendan died,
Harris came to see me.

1188
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,390
He was a mess...

1189
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:12,960
and he said that...

1190
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,990
.. that him and his mate had
been climbing the Tower Drop.

1191
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,860
So I followed him...

1192
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:31,890
.. and...
there was this body...

1193
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,720
.. covered in blood.

1194
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,120
I knew that there was
nothing we could do for him.

1195
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,230
Harris swore that
it was an accident.

1196
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,620
But I knew what
it looked like...

1197
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:03,280
.. and what it could
do for our reputation.

1198
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:08,719
The fairground's finances a year
ago were in a pretty sorry state.

1199
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:12,509
So I completely understand
why you wouldn't want

1200
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:16,500
news of a fatal accident getting
out to scupper things further.

1201
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:21,079
So instead of calling an
ambulance or the police,

1202
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:24,679
you wrapped this
lad's body in bin bags

1203
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,759
and slung him in an unmarked
grave in the middle of nowhere.

1204
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,339
Then came back as if
nothing had happened.

1205
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:33,149
- No, it wasn't like that.
- Roll up, roll up!

1206
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:36,980
The show must go on...
and it did.

1207
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:42,900
So, jump to a year later, hm?

1208
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:46,469
When poor young Jamie

1209
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:49,340
finds out what happened
to Brendan.

1210
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:53,180
Cos Harris can't
keep his mouth shut.

1211
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,300
Am I right?

1212
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:02,950
He came to the office to
tell us what Harris had said.

1213
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:10,340
Jamie said that he had
to do the right thing.

1214
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:14,309
He had to tell the police.

1215
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:16,709
That reverend's small
act of kindness in

1216
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:19,769
giving this lad
shelter over Christmas.

1217
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:22,380
So Jamie felt he owed him.

1218
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,719
So I said I'd help him.

1219
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:33,320
I asked Jamie to...

1220
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:39,039
.. to show me where Harris
had said that the body was.

1221
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,860
Even though you knew.

1222
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:48,600
When I got there, I realised
what it all looked like.

1223
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,100
That I'd...

1224
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:57,110
I'd buried that lad...

1225
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,310
.. and nobody'd
forgive me for that.

1226
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,120
Well,
certainly not the lad's family.

1227
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,940
So instead of handing
Jamie the shovel,

1228
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:12,930
you hit him over
the head with it.

1229
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,550
- It just happened.
- Twice.

1230
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,059
You hit him twice.

1231
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:22,159
It wasn't planned.
I didn't think about it.

1232
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,329
So how come
you had the bin bags

1233
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:27,140
and the gaffer tape with you,
pet, hm?

1234
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,789
I can see now why you didn't
want Harris with your daughter.

1235
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:35,399
He knew what you'd done.

1236
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,520
Only a matter of time before
he blabbed it to her, an' all.

1237
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:41,640
But do you know what?

1238
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:45,739
Harris was willing
to take the blame

1239
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:47,799
for Jamie's murder...

1240
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:52,390
.. just so the love of his
life wouldn't lose her mam.

1241
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,639
Bobby always says that...

1242
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:03,000
the two most important things

1243
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:05,740
are the business and our family.

1244
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:10,029
All I was doing was trying
to protect them both.

1245
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:12,149
Well, that's very noble.

1246
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:13,629
Is that what you were doing

1247
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:16,910
when you put Jamie's bag
in Reverend Haleford's bin?

1248
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,959
- Charge her.
- Morven Pevensey,

1249
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,519
you're under arrest
for the murder of Jamie Thorne

1250
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:28,400
and for conspiring to conceal
the death of Brendan Haleford.

1251
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:25,839
Ma'am.

1252
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,550
The verdict's in on
Bethany's inquest.

1253
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,860
The coroner's ruled
unlawful killing.

1254
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,310
And were there comments?

1255
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:41,229
Will we be "taking learnings"
from this?

1256
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:44,250
The only comment was they're
giving her the bravery award.

1257
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,399
Now, that is right.

1258
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,540
They don't often get it right,
but that is right.

1259
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,390
Yeah, I'd say so.

1260
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:59,159
Worth raising a glass to,
in't it? What do we reckon?

1261
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,299
Yeah, that's a good idea.
You lot go down.

1262
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:05,039
I'll finish up here and...
Here you are.

1263
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,180
Aiden, give me a tenner.

1264
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,190
Here you are.
Stick this behind the bar.

1265
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,799
- Go on!
- Well, come on. Come down yourself.

1266
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:19,750
Hands up all those who want
the boss down the pub with 'em.

1267
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:22,760
Go on.

1268
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,040
First round on the gaffer, eh?

1269
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:57,870
Caught me.

1270
01:27:58,350 --> 01:27:59,650
I'll turn a blind eye.

1271
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,169
We ended up in The Dragon,

1272
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:04,479
and I thought,

1273
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,050
"Well,
she might be an antisocial cow,

1274
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,610
"but no-one deserves to
miss out on prawn toast."

1275
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,480
Go on, then,
you've twisted my arm.

1276
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,290
Hand that mug over.

1277
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,120
Go on.

1278
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:24,170
Get that down you.

1279
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:27,780
I won't tell your missus.

1280
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:41,160

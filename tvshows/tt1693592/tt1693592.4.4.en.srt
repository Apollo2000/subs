"Death of a Family Man"

5
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,280
Look at that.

6
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,750
Makes it harder to swim.

7
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,100
Mm. Make it harder to step off,
though, wouldn't it?

8
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,349
-Might not have gone in here.
-True.

9
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,480
Get onto the coastguard.
Get the tide times.

10
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,310
Better late than never.

11
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,110
Don't tell me you haven't
noticed.

12
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,889
I've not noticed.

13
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,690
Marcus Summer.
Apologies.

14
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,019
Sorry,
the signal was dire.

15
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,609
Kenny said it's suicide.

16
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,139
-Sorry, we...
-Well, it's not clear. Look.

17
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,549
-Suggests non-accidental.
-Well, it's what they do, isn't it?

18
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,359
Marcus, how long would you say?

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,749
At a glance, five, six days.

20
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,339
Scratch injuries.

21
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,459
Could be deliberate.
Could be from branches.

22
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,139
Well, the rowers hit the body

23
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,199
about an hour ago.
Could it be that?

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,739
Could be.
Sorry, I'll get up to speed.

25
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,840
And there's a bump on the back of
the head.

26
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,059
Was that pre- or post-mortem?

27
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,609
Pre.

28
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,959
Whacked it on the way down?

29
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,379
The fibula has snapped.
Suggests impact.

30
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,230
Could have jumped or he could have
fallen.

31
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,029
No ligature marks.
There's nothing on the wrists.

32
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,419
So nothing obvious saying suicide?

33
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,920
Other than the shoelaces, no.

34
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,319
There's nothing from Missing Persons.
Well, nothing that fits.

35
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,070
What, five days and nobody notices?

36
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,459
He's not homeless.

37
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,669
Or at least
he had money at some point.

38
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,790
His shirt, it's bespoke.
It says here...

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,169
-Cawley & Griffin.
-Could be cast-offs.

40
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,989
The jacket matches the trousers.
The shoes are pretty solid.

41
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,789
Well, that's all we've got to go on,

42
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,199
so let's see Cawley & Griffin.

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,450
You can start on the statements.

44
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,670
We just went out on the bike.

45
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,989
He's got no mates up here.
We're just...

46
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,579
She's not bothered.

47
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,020
It's just suicides, you know.
They put her in a bad mood.

48
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,179
Gold labels are my colleague,
but I do have this.

49
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,129
-Is it a list of clients?
-A list of pieces.

50
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,769
Do you have a photo of the shirt?

51
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,999
We have a torso shot,
but it is post-mortem.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,309
Will you be all right with that?

53
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,710
If it will help.

54
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,670
OK.
So we're looking at a Modena in the
sky blue.

55
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,419
No monogram, is there?

56
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,589
So that's what?
A 44 chest and a 17 neck.

57
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,080
Let me...

58
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,719
OK. As an educated guess,
I'd say it was...

59
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,380
John Shearwood.

60
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,169
-Do you know him?
-Yes, if it was him.

61
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,959
A big family man, I think.

62
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,680
Ran his own business.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,689
Exports, I think.

64
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,229
Certainly lorries
in there somewhere.

65
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,859
-Do you have an address?
-Yes.

66
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,470
I do. I do.

67
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,190
What's happened to him?

68
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,289
He was found in the river.

69
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,850
Good grief.

70
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,840
Can you send someone up to this
property near Steel Rigg?

71
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,359
Just say that we've found a body.

72
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,180
We need an ID. Yeah.
Keep it open.

73
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,199
This is the fella, is it?

74
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,929
Yeah, I'd say so.

75
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,789
Does he look suicidal to you?

76
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,190
-You never can tell, can you?
-No, you cannot.

77
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,059
A wedding ring.

78
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,719
Our body didn't have a wedding ring,
did it?

79
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,129
He's an older fella.

80
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,860
Isn't always their thing, is it?

81
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,699
Nice place,
if you like sheep, isn't it?

82
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,029
Some people like remote.

83
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,929
I couldn't stand it.

84
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,280
I'd end up...

85
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,089
..going mad.

86
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,180
Do you not like your own company?

87
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,250
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

88
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,730
Just not on my own.

89
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,379
DCI Vera Stanhope.

90
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,499
-This is my Sergeant...
-DS Joe Ashworth.

91
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,259
I'm Luke Shearwood.
I'm his brother.

92
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,819
So presumably you know
why we're here?

93
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,109
Stella called me.
What's happened?

94
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,469
Well, we're just looking to identify
a body, at present.

95
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,559
It won't be him. He's in Dublin.

96
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,869
OK.

97
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,770
-Can we go in?
-Please.

98
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,209
<i>Hi.
John Shearwood here.</i>

99
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,660
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

100
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,659
Right.
It's his voicemail.

101
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,019
It doesn't mean anything. He's just
busy.

102
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,240
So when did you last have contact?

103
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,469
Tuesday. Early evening.
He texted me saying he had landed.

104
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,369
What, five days?
Nothing since?

105
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,339
But...
I mean, that's normal.

106
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,479
He's rushed off his feet on these
trips.

107
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,450
-So when's he due back?
-Tomorrow.

108
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,720
Where was it found?
Where in the Tyne?

109
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,200
Near Dunston Staithes.

110
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,409
John owns a flat near the Staithes.

111
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,510
-In the development there.
-Right.

112
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,219
Can you give us the address?

113
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,920
I've got the keys somewhere.

114
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,929
Look, it...
It won't be him, I mean...

115
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,289
He'll probably be on a
golf course somewhere,

116
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,150
cursing my name for calling.

117
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,790
So, what happens next?

118
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,659
Well, we would ask for
someone close to John

119
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,809
to identify his effects.

120
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,159
It won't be him.

121
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,709
I mean, my husband would never come
back early without telling me.

122
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,139
Did he go to Dublin alone?

123
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,449
I suppose so.

124
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,409
You should ask the office.
Mark would know.

125
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,309
-And Mark is?
-His oldest mate.

126
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,820
He manages the day-to-day.

127
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,439
How...?

128
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,659
How did he end up in the water,
this person?

129
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,949
Well, that's what we're
trying to establish.

130
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,399
Presumably it was an accident. It's
not going to be deliberate, is it?

131
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,439
Well, we don't know.

132
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,799
We advise that people
don't come alone.

133
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,539
Is there another member
of the family tah could...

134
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,719
Our son.
But he's away this weekend.

135
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,279
And where is he?

136
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,859
Seeing a band.

137
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,739
-OK.
-I don't know which one.

138
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,229
Well, if you could give
us his phone number,

139
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,169
we'll try and track him down.

140
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,470
Right.

141
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,059
How long do they think
this...person...

142
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,059
Some time in the last few days.

143
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,989
I texted him this...morning. I...

144
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,350
I just thought he was too busy to
reply.

145
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,329
How was your husband in himself
recently?

146
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,349
Things were good,
I mean...

147
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,290
Better than they'd been for a while.

148
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,309
Now, we'll have someone drive you
down there.

149
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,689
But I would say take support.

150
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,859
I'll be OK.
It's the least I can do.

151
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,160
Right.

152
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,690
Sorry.
Sorry, excuse me!

153
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,880
I didn't want to ask in front of
Stella, but...

154
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,290
do you think it was...

155
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,999
Could he have gone in
the water on purpose?

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,409
Well, is that something John might do?

157
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,500
-I don't know.
-Well, without the postmortem...

158
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,120
I wouldn't want to say, love.

159
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,830
So, if it is him in the water,
the body didn't travel.

160
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,090
Must have got jammed in the timbers.

161
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,899
Get frogmen into the area where we
found him

162
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,239
and tell Kenny to
check out the company

163
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,209
and that whatshisname,
Mark Donovan fella.

164
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,410
Was the wife Swedish?
Danish, I think.

165
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,920
-What do you make of her?
-Well, she's a bit odd.

166
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,510
Could just be the shock.

167
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,489
-Maybe.
-What?

168
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,029
Well, it just didn't look like a
family lived there, that's all.

169
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,059
It's just a look.
Celine would love it.

170
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,810
"Scandi chic", she calls it.

171
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,160
Maybe I'm just behind the times.

172
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,649
So when did you last see your
boss?

173
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,669
It was Monday.

174
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,010
We had lunch. Rodolfo's.
A cheap Italian place.

175
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,149
You don't work afternoons, then?

176
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,519
Well, I do.

177
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,629
He went home to pack.

178
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,329
For this trip to Ireland?

179
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,240
Well, so I thought.

180
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,809
And what's he do out there?

181
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,170
He meets some Irish blokes
who do what we do, I think.

182
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,149
-Have you got a contact name?
-I don't, no.

183
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,559
To be honest,
I thought it was an excuse

184
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,469
for some sort of jolly.

185
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,639
A bit of work and a lot of golf,
eh?

186
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,650
He's done it before.
Still...

187
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,489
..his firm, his prerogative.

188
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,249
Probably be back in
tomorrow morning,

189
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,120
giving off about
his handicap.

190
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,579
<i>Hi.
John Shearwood here.</i>

191
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,859
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

192
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,899
Yeah, John, it's Owen.
Call me when you can.

193
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,169
His head whacked against something.

194
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,580
With some force.
Knocked him out.

195
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,110
However, this suggests he's been in
a fight.

196
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,729
Any other defensive injuries?

197
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,039
Very few.

198
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,799
It wasn't a huge ruck,
let's put it that way.

199
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,699
So the attacker got lucky?

200
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,769
Well, he wouldn't have been steady
on his feet.

201
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,710
There was alcohol in the blood
and there were antidepressants.

202
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,489
Can you tell how long
he'd been taking them?

203
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,879
-No. But it wasn't a trivial dose.
-Get hold of the GP.

204
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,439
See if you can find out
when they were prescribed.

205
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,539
The wife never mentioned that,
did

206
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,879
Maybe she didn't know.

207
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,760
-You're sure it was a murder?
-I'd say so, from the nasty bit.

208
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,209
His stomach was full of algae from
the river, which means...

209
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,529
Which means he wasn't dead
when he went into the water.

210
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,239
He couldn't swim, because his legs
were broken from the fall.

211
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,710
And his shoelaces were tied
together.

212
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,870
Not a nice way to go.

213
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,519
Might not seem important to you.

214
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,820
It might not seem...

215
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,250
You'll be all right for a couple of
minutes?

216
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,539
-Are you in?
-Yeah. Been cleaned, though.

217
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,940
-Service comes in every Wednesday.
-Is this the cleaner?

218
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,019
-Cameras?
-Nothing.

219
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,039
Well, there's one in the underground
car park.

220
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,269
-Security?
-Him, but he only works days.

221
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,779
He says he saw him drive in
about six o'clock on Tuesday.

222
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,080
Tuesday?

223
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,310
That's about the time
he said he was landing in Dublin.

224
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,730
Right.

225
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,170
Just follow me.

226
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,980
Did you see him?

227
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,080
No.

228
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,230
And this is how you left it,
more or less?

229
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,840
Yes.

230
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,789
There's nothing really
telling us who he is.

231
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,409
-It's a crash pad.
-But the wife said he was living here,

232
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,089
in the week, though.
There'd be knick-knacks.

233
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,599
And the bin is empty.
What does that suggest?

234
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,900
That he hasn't been in
since she's been in.

235
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,139
What time do you come Wednesday,
love?

236
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,699
The shift starts at 7×m.

237
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,960
And how was it when you found it?

238
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,919
Very clean.

239
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,210
I thought he was at his other house.

240
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,010
No forced entry.

241
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,379
-OK. Prints on this, please.
-OK.

242
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,219
These two were next to the bed.

243
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,929
Just missed a call from an Owen.

244
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,629
Owen?
Do we know who that is?

245
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,980
-The phone is locked.
-Get Kenny onto it.

246
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,230
Changed the locks.

247
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,079
Didn't tell the missus, though,
so what does that suggest?

248
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,489
She told Uniform
she's not been in town for months.

249
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,339
Might explain the no wedding ring.

250
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,399
A neighbour heard his buzzer
around nine on Tuesday night.

251
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,650
-From what? Outside?
-Yeah.

252
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,589
John, I need you to get
the hoover over to the lab.

253
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,279
See what's in there.

254
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,769
And then spray for traces.

255
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,879
You're gonna have
to do all over.

256
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,360
The hoover is in the kitchen.

257
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,389
Do you clean outside, love?

258
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,800
No. I'm inside only.

259
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,880
Don't touch.

260
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,649
Bluestar and UV.

261
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,430
-All of this.
-Right.

262
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,440
Joe!

263
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,810
This has been cleaned and not by
her. Look at this.

264
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,670
Now Marcus says the scratches
could have been caused by branches.

265
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,670
-So what? He jumped from here?
-Possible.

266
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,080
Fell 40 feet to his death.

267
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,940
Except it's a short
stroll to the river.

268
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,510
Give me strength.

269
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,730
Check that against the sky-blue
Modena.

270
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,600
-Footprints have gone in the rain?
-Right.

271
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,889
How did he take it,
this Mark?

272
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,399
The wife had phoned
ahead and told him.

273
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,489
The first person she
called after we left?

274
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,949
Yeah,
he reckons Ireland was a...

275
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,800
cover story for a jolly.

276
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,020
Now I think he could have been
dragged through here.

277
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,359
And slipped into the river.

278
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,290
Might not even have heard a sound.

279
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,729
We've found him!

280
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,030
From the top, please.

281
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,159
6:05pm. Tuesday.

282
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,360
That's John Shearwood's car driving
in.

283
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,919
-When did he drive out?
-Monday before lunch.

284
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,279
So what was he doing between Monday
lunch and here, coming back Tuesday?

285
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,689
-Where did he sleep?
-I don't know.

286
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,109
Well, find out.

287
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,890
What I do have...

288
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,969
Tuesday 9:05pm.

289
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,790
Mark Donovan pays John a visit.

290
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,579
He definitely told me

291
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,019
he last saw Shearwood
lunchtime Monday.

292
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,289
He leaves about eight minutes later.

293
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,599
Eight minutes?

294
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,559
Is that enough time to get upstairs,
kill someone, clean up and dispose?

295
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,319
I can walk it through, but...

296
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,109
No, he was at the scene on the
night, plus he lied to Kenny.

297
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,679
I think that's grounds enough to
bring him in.

298
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,439
DCI Stanhope?

299
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,700
-Yeah?
-Owen Preece.

300
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,310
Owen?

301
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,249
-Revenue & Customs?
-Yeah. Don't worry.

302
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,750
You're not in trouble.

303
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,640
John Shearwood,
is he dead?

304
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,770
He was working for me.

305
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,379
As an informant.

306
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,549
So this is a booze scam, is it?

307
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,909
In the old days, they'd pick up in Calais
and distribute around the corner shops.

308
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,689
These days,
they barely bother with Calais.

309
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,119
You don't pay VAT till
it leaves the warehouse.

310
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,129
So, unless we see it leave...

311
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,669
-How long has he been at it?
-About nine months.

312
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,659
So, John just came to you, did he,
to shop his mate?

313
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,459
No. No.
We've been onto people

314
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,769
further up the supply
chain for about a year.

315
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,219
A network of bases in the southeast.

316
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,889
Mark's just a local cog,
really, so I approached John

317
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,749
-and asked if we could keep an eye.
--And he agreed? Just like that?

318
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,089
Yeah.

319
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,389
-I thought they were mates.
-So did he.

320
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,529
Been with him since the start,
he said.

321
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,020
And he gave him over?
Just like that to you lot.

322
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,140
So what does that say about John
Shearwood?

323
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,830
-Dobbing in a mate.
-Business before friendship?

324
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,999
He's got a family to support.

325
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,659
-Was he after a deal?
-Yeah. Yeah.

326
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,800
He wanted the firm to come out of
this with a clean sheet.

327
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,189
Did Mark know that John
had shopped him

328
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,140
or one of the blokes up the ladder?

329
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,060
Could have been a motive.
Could it?

330
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,179
Revenge?

331
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,730
Or to shut him up.

332
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,059
We're going to need a copy of this.
We're bringing him in on suspicion.

333
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,769
What are the chances of me holding
you off 12 hours?

334
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,029
-No chance.
-We've got an operation on-going.

335
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,889
-Yeah? So have we.
-Intelligence reports

336
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,449
this Mark is picking up
a consignment at 7am.

337
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,469
Noe. If we could catch
him doing a handover...

338
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,079
I'm not have a potential killer swanning about.

339
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,189
I reckon I could get him to give me
the names of the bigger fish.

340
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,799
If there's a criminal conspiracy,

341
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,539
I want each and every one of them
in here in my interview room.

342
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,329
-They're fraudsters.
-So?

343
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,160
They don't knock people off.

344
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,139
So where did you train in profiling?

345
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,519
Look, if this was dangerous, would
they have the likes of me running it?

346
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,109
He's in it over his head.

347
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,800
They've seen us sniffing about.
They're not going to go ahead now.

348
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,910
Sorry.

349
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,220
Could it be a good thing?

350
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,740
More grounds to hold him?
More time to build a case?

351
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,029
I mean,
if Mark's the killer,

352
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,139
he's gonna want to keep
his nose clean, isn't he?

353
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,159
So, if it's a no-show, bang,
there's your motive.

354
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,239
Led a murder investigation,
have you?

355
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,400
Nope.
Just worked my way up Customs.

356
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,410
Finding rabid dogs.

357
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,250
All right.

358
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,229
Our suspect, Mark Donovan,

359
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,939
will now be under surveillance
until 0700 tomorrow morning.

360
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,149
At which point, our colleagues from
HMRC and Tactical Support will take over

361
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,889
and execute Operation Long Run.

362
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,569
The suspect will then be arrested on
suspicion and handed over to us.

363
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,739
In the meantime,
get down to your local offie

364
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,009
and buy up that
cheeky wee red.

365
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,719
In the meantime, we continue to
follow our leads

366
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,389
and do everything we can

367
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,099
to cooperate with our
colleagues from the Revenue.

368
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,349
A list of our surveillance targets.
Nothing previous for violence.

369
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,029
Maybe none of them have been
turned over before.

370
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,609
Maybe not,
but I checked our logs.

371
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,219
All of them bar Mark were down
south on the days you're looking at.

372
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,830
Thanks.
Thank you.

373
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,740
Right, what do we know?

374
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,040
John Shearwood - businessman.

375
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,839
He's a family man,

376
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,569
splitting his time
between two addresses.

377
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,899
We've no intelligence linking him
to anything untoward.

378
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,359
Prior to his death,

379
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,979
he told friends and family
he was going to Dublin to work.

380
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,280
However...

381
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:19,290
blood traces have been found in the
flat.

382
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,979
And his last known movements

383
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,469
would suggest that
this is where he died.

384
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,509
We think sometime between
the last sighting,

385
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,119
which was Tuesday, early evening,

386
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,179
and Wednesday morning.

387
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,689
Now there is no sign of a forced entry,

388
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,459
which suggests that the
killer was someone he knew.

389
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,190
Did they turn up on spec?
Or was it planned?

390
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,470
Was there a tussle?

391
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,669
I mean, did the blow to the head on
the glass render him unconscious?

392
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,059
Or was he pushed
and he died from the fall?

393
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,939
Whichever it was, they tried
to make it look like suicide.

394
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,759
I think they dragged the body to the river,

395
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,259
where they were hoping it
would all disappear.

396
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,569
It didn't.

397
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,639
The neighbour heard the doorbell
ring around about 9 or 10pm-ish.

398
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,279
Most likely this Mark fella.
The time fits. Right?

399
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,999
-Was he let in?
-Well, that's what we need to find out.

400
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,529
The timeframe between
texting the wife...

401
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,339
7:50pm.

402
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,349
There was a sighting in the car
park, 6:05.

403
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,209
And the arrival of the cleaner in
the morning.

404
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,269
We need to check the movements on
the suspect, but also of family,

405
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,579
friends, associates.

406
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,979
Run an APC on the numberplates -
roads in and out of the flat.

407
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,549
Right. Kenny, did you manage to get
into John Shearwood's mobile?

408
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,920
Er... His recent call list was
deleted by himself.

409
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,139
-That interesting!
-Rebecca Shepherd.

410
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,690
What?
Covering his tracks?

411
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,190
Anything else?

412
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,339
-Decking.
-Why would anyone photograph that?

413
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,989
-To show off your decking.
-No, that's fine. Thank you.

414
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,299
Ma'am!

415
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,729
-The brother has ID'd.
-Right, Shep.

416
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,149
Get up there.
Get a statement from the wife.

417
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,739
No stone unturned.

418
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,069
What about the son, Billy,
has he been informed?

419
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,770
-Still no trace.
-Well, we need him found.

420
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,699
Well, he's the only member of his
family with any previous.

421
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,000
What?

422
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,099
Shoplifting.

423
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,599
Disorder.

424
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,149
Investigated for dangerous
driving.

425
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,130
July 2011.

426
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,059
Well, get that printed out for me.

427
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,660
I can't.
It's deleted.

428
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,569
He was a juvenile at the time.

429
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,639
Well, you're good on computers,
Kenny.

430
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,440
Undelete.

431
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,259
Thank you.

432
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,750
Family Liaison will
drive you back.

433
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,500
-Where's home?
-Bickley.

434
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,520
I'm going to stay with Stella for a
bit.

435
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,039
I forgot to ask you, love.

436
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,020
Where were you on Tuesday evening?

437
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,520
Is that when you think...?

438
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,579
I was up in Berwick, the most part
of Tuesday, through to Wednesday.

439
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,679
-Picking up from a seller.
-Right.

440
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,619
Anyone vouch for you?

441
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,629
I stayed in a hotel up there.

442
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,279
Right, well, we're going to
have to double-check that.

443
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,379
You understand, don't you, love?

444
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,680
Of course.

445
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,189
DC Shepherd.
Do you mind if I...

446
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,630
-No. Please come in.
-Thanks.

447
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,719
I'm sorry to bother you.
I just need to take a statement.

448
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,310
-Do you want a cup of tea?
-That would be lovely, thank you.

449
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,839
Actually, do you mind
if I just make a quick phone call?

450
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,200
Of course not.

451
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:00,479
Kenny, any DNA results on the
bloodstain?

452
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,889
Nothing yet.

453
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,780
We're being methodical.

454
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,979
Sorry.

455
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,129
But, you know,
if you've been in contact...

456
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,879
We need something to
track down Donovan's DNA.

457
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,280
-What have you got?
-Hang on.

458
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,159
Like Churchill's bunker in here.

459
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,419
The documentation he
gave to a warehouse.

460
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,829
Might have licked the envelope.

461
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,270
-Good.
-Ma'am!

462
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,959
Shep's on line one having a paddy.

463
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,089
Donovan's at Stella's now.

464
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,939
I thought you were
staying away from him.

465
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,339
We didn't know he was there,
did we?

466
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,729
-Did you, Mr. Surveillance?
-What does she do?

467
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,910
Tell her not to alert him.

468
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,469
-The best we can do.
-Fantastic.

469
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,229
We're dealing with a dead body here.

470
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,670
Not some scam over a load of dodgy
plonk.

471
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,470
Owen...

472
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,799
Was John aware of the extent of this
operation?

473
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,349
Well, not the details, no.

474
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,959
Just that we needed a window.

475
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,599
So this trip to Dublin

476
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,549
was just so Mark would
think the coast was clear?

477
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,859
Yeah.

478
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,279
So why tell that same lie to his
missus?

479
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,599
Why not tell her the truth?

480
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,550
Well, he'd split from
his wife, hadn't he?

481
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,909
-Is that what he told you?
-Yeah. He definitely implied a third party to me.

482
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,319
Well, why didn't we know that?

483
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,149
Cos the wife said it was all rosy.

484
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,709
Ma'am.

485
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,010
The plate confirmation of Stella's
car.

486
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,329
Drove into town about 2am, Tuesday.

487
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,090
-Is that her driving?
-Looks like it.

488
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,809
What, on the road,
the middle of the night?

489
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,589
As you do.

490
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,110
She told us she hadn't been into the
city for months.

491
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,120
<i>Operation Long Run,
all units in place.</i>

492
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,939
<i>All units now in place.</i>

493
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,189
<i>Red One, Red Two and Red
Three are in position.</i>

494
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,620
<i>Eyes on the main entrance.</i>

495
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,849
<i>No sign of Donovan.</i>

496
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,829
<i>The other guy is approaching
the rendezvous point.</i>

497
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,139
The rendezvous!

498
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,419
I hope they're all
wearing their carnations.

499
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,609
-I love a bit of TST, me.
-This isn't about knock-off booze.

500
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:46,419
It's about that Mark fella
and his best friend's missus.

501
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,849
We're checking his phone records.

502
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,049
I could be there asking her, instead
of sitting here on my backside.

503
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,129
Come on.
15 seconds max.

504
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,939
We get him in custody,
we've got bargaining power.

505
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,419
I doubt he'll even go through with
it.

506
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,109
With the police nosing about,
this is a waste of my time, Joe.

507
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,849
<i>Hasn't shown up yet, boss.</i>

508
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,159
There you are.
Told you.

509
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,540
<i>No visual on Donovan.
Repeat, no visual on Donovan.</i>

510
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,410
Why has it gone quiet?

511
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,460
<i>Got him. Yeah, that's him.
Confirming visual on Mark Donovan.</i>

512
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,679
<i>The van.
Got him.</i>

513
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,230
And he's here.
Can you confirm eye contact?

514
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,460
<i>Roger, sir, confirming eye contact
of suspect Mark Donovan.</i>

515
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,420
<i>Got him. Donovan is here.
A green Transit.</i>

516
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,319
<i>-They're unloading now.
-Can we take them?</i>

517
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,640
<i>No. Wait.</i>

518
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,510
<i>He's stopped unloading.
I think he's clocked us, boss.</i>

519
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,039
What is it?

520
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,779
Get out of here now.
Get out. Now!

521
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,389
He's clocked us. Repeat.
He's clocked us.

522
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:29,440
<i>0-2, you take the blue van.
We'll take Mark.</i>

523
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,149
<i>Take the other van.
I'll go after Donovan.</i>

524
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,189
<i>Roger, boss.
Go. Go!</i>

525
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,939
<i>Where to?
Cut him off. Get in front of him!</i>

526
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,149
He's getting away.
The bugger is getting away.

527
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,500
<i>Follow him, Red Two.
Put your foot down.</i>

528
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,639
<i>Sorry, boss, he got round me.</i>

529
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,130
<i>Who have we got covering the gate?
Anyone?</i>

530
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,239
<i>Make sure
he doesn't get through the gate.</i>

531
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,430
Where's the bloody uniforms?

532
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,830
Left, left, left!

533
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,710
<i>Head him off down the front,
down the front.</i>

534
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,330
<i>-Well done, lads.</i>
-They've got him.

535
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,879
-Well done.
-Good work, lads.

536
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,180
<i>Got him.</i>

537
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,620
You stupid sod.
You stupid sod!

538
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,029
It's a bit late for that, Mark.

539
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:28,170
Oh, he's going to be full of himself
now, isn't he, that Owen?

540
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,139
All yours.

541
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,719
-Who grassed me up?
-Who do you think?

542
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,790
I don't know. I genuinely don't.

543
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,900
John.

544
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,270
-Is this a wind-up?
-No.

545
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,520
Well, there's thanks for you!

546
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,489
All the work I put
into his business,

547
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,389
while he's swanning off!

548
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,970
He gave you a promotion
and a pay rise.

549
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,370
1.2%.

550
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,920
He's running two properties,
never mind the golf.

551
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,559
And he gives me 1.2%!

552
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,350
I'm one of his oldest mates.

553
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,720
The selfish bastard!

554
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,919
We've got you on CCTV Tuesday evening

555
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,859
in the car park at his place.

556
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,759
I just...

557
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,900
-wanted to talk to him.
-Well, you looked quite agitated.

558
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,329
One of the lads reckoned they'd seen
him...

559
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,910
late Tuesday afternoon.

560
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,709
I thought he was on a flight to
Dublin.

561
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,680
Yeah, so you were panicking.

562
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,470
I thought he might know.

563
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,670
He'd been off with me for a while.

564
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,310
You know, not looking me in the eye
and...

565
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,169
I was going to tell him.

566
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,650
What, hoping he'd turn a blind eye?

567
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,109
That's a bit risky.

568
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,660
I should never have started this.

569
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,369
I needed the money.

570
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,479
I'm fighting my ex for the kids.

571
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,500
OK. So you told him.

572
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,929
There was a fight.
He gets knocked out.

573
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,659
No.

574
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,510
No, not at all.

575
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,810
I buzzed a few times.
There was no reply.

576
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,699
Maybe he was dead by then.

577
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,419
And maybe he let you in.

578
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,030
He didn't.

579
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,170
Come on.

580
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,870
Would I have done any of this if I
knew I was in the frame for murder?

581
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,040
Is he your man?

582
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,659
Well, you know,
we're working on it.

583
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,969
Whenever you're ready.

584
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:12,829
-Any matches on the DNA?
-Yeah. Loads.

585
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,219
Everyone but the bloke
we've got in custody.

586
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,869
Most of the family, the cleaning
lady, you.

587
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,599
The only turn-up's a
blood spot in the bathroom

588
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,299
that doesn't
match anyone.

589
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,539
So, nothing putting Mark Donovan
inside the flat.

590
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,040
No. Sorry.

591
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,639
So, could...
Could I take him?

592
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,119
No, you can't!
We've only had him a couple of hours.

593
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,429
OK.
No worries.

594
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,830
I promised the lads Nando's,
anyway.

595
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:40,580
What was your relationship with his
missus?

596
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,760
Right.

597
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,779
Was it her who told you I'd done it?

598
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,320
-Why would she say that?
-She never cared for me.

599
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,919
Always took my ex's side.

600
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,229
For everything.

601
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,259
So why did you go to see her
yesterday?

602
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,210
To offer my condolences.

603
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,640
I know I was...
Ripping him off, yes.

604
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,500
But I thought we were still mates.

605
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,049
The APC.

606
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,930
Mark's car was seen at 9:45,
but it doesn't come up again.

607
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,739
The caff that he lives above is open
till 3am

608
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,799
and the owner reckons he saw him go
up to the flat and stay there.

609
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,859
Now his car is parked up on the CCTV
the whole night.

610
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,969
So, unless he sneaked out to get a
night bus...

611
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:39,980
So that leaves us with the wife driving
in the direction of town at 2×m.

612
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,269
-Anything else?
-A bloke at the Italian restaurant

613
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,649
reckons he saw John pick up
the car at 5:30 on Tuesday.

614
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,689
He must have driven
straight back to the flat.

615
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,779
Well,
why did he leave it there 24 hours?

616
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,509
It's like you say,
he was staying somewhere else.

617
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:56,919
The mum called the son seven times
between midnight and half two.

618
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,639
Have we tracked him down yet?

619
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,170
Yeah. I can get you real time on
where he is at this very moment.

620
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,509
There you go.

621
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,910
So the son is in Bickley.
Isn't that where the uncle lives?

622
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,939
Do we want extra bodies sent up?

623
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,249
No.

624
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,520
Where is anyone going to run to?

625
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,570
I presume he's inside.

626
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,049
Look, I'm so sorry.

627
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,679
I just didn't want him to be
questioned while he is so vulnerable.

628
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,079
No, that's all right, love.

629
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,680
We've had him here on a sort of
detox.

630
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,300
What's he been using?

631
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,389
Alcohol.

632
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,999
Also, skunk, you know,
the kind you get addicted to.

633
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,939
Psychotropic?

634
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,449
John and I, we've...

635
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:26,380
tried everything, we've spent
a small fortune on clinics.

636
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,389
I guess, sometimes, you have to...

637
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,950
distance yourself
for your own sanity.

638
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,369
Is it working?

639
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,499
-I should say so, yeah.
-That's good.

640
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,429
Luke sorted him out a bit.

641
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,730
Good.

642
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:44,039
Er, where were you driving, Tuesday,
middle of the night?

643
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,039
2am.

644
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,610
Just around. I couldn't sleep.

645
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,529
That's a long way to go for
insomnia.

646
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,459
Down the A668.

647
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,529
And your car is not back on the road
near your house

648
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:59,279
until 11 in the morning.
So...

649
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,179
where did you stay?

650
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,120
I stayed here.

651
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,529
She just came here to see Billy.

652
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,369
How do you know?
You was in Berwick.

653
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,019
I'm just going on what they told me.

654
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,839
Came here via the road into the
city, it's a strange route.

655
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,469
I think she stopped for petrol.

656
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,679
Well, that's good.
We can check that.

657
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,119
The middle of the night,
won't be too many customers.

658
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,850
And she called you at 2×m.
Several times.

659
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,999
I'd been and got myself some weed.

660
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,690
Where from, around here?

661
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,319
There's a pub in town.

662
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,010
She came up to take it off me.

663
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,020
It'll be all right.

664
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,919
Right,
we'll split them up

665
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,029
and work them till they slip up.

666
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,979
What about Mark Donovan?
Oh, out of the picture for now.

667
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,339
-Hand him back to Smuggins at the Revenue.
-When he gets back from his lunch.

668
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,689
Ma'am, triangulation maps.
Who, what, where, when.

669
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:40,109
6pm Tuesday to four the next
morning.

670
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,569
Yellow's Mum.
Billy's blue.

671
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,250
And this is where he says he bought
his drugs.

672
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:50,049
How far is this from the scene?

673
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,579
On the doorstep, ma'am.

674
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,179
Well, well, well.

675
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,099
And is Luke Shearwood with them?

676
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,430
No. The hotel in Berwick have him
there from Tuesday to early Wednesday.

677
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,449
Right.

678
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,599
But we've got mother and son in the
vicinity.

679
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,920
That'll do.

680
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,599
Now...
what else?

681
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,609
A kid with a history
of substance abuse.

682
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,769
Husband and wife possibly estranged.

683
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,369
A family man.
On antidepressants.

684
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,209
Living apart from the family.

685
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,860
The son's drug use split them apart.
I've seen it before.

686
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,580
Maybe something happened
to split them apart,

687
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,779
which resulted in the drug abuse.

688
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,939
Ma'am. Billy Shearwood's
deleted records.

689
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,249
Ah, well done, Kenny.

690
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,470
Dangerous driving.
We arrested him in 2011.

691
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,469
The CPS upgraded the charge
to manslaughter

692
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,019
in early 2012.

693
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,449
Who did he kill?

694
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,770
A little lad called Ethan Bailey.

695
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,209
Knocked him dead,

696
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,470
showing off in
Daddy's Merc.

697
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,539
<i>The charges were dropped
two months later.</i>

698
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,269
<i>A smart-arse lawyer
by the look of it.</i>

699
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,459
<i>Billy in trouble again, is he?</i>

700
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,040
-That's a shame.
-All right, all right, in you go.

701
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:05,070
He was doing over 40 in a 30 zone.

702
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,860
The kid died before he reached the
hospital.

703
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,859
Shep...

704
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,639
The shoplifting and the other
offences happened after the accident,

705
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,669
-right?
-A clean sheet before that.

706
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,709
The arresting officer
on one of those Class Bs

707
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,859
remembers him, though,

708
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,299
as being aggressive and a bit of a
wind-up.

709
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,769
Yeah. I've got that.

710
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,899
Stayed away from jail,
though, didn't he?

711
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,679
Well, looking at these,
the family spent a fortune

712
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,379
on lawyers and rehab.

713
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,680
Put 'em into debt.

714
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,469
Can we do an impairment test,

715
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,579
make sure he's fit to talk?

716
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,830
-If we must.
-Thank you.

717
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,119
Do you want to see the triangulation
maps?

718
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,169
That's on the mobile phones.

719
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,069
Look, I didn't go to the flat.

720
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,679
It's a coincidence,
then, is it,

721
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,689
you just passing on
the night he died?

722
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,700
-No.
-What about your son? Got him there, too.

723
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,979
He was in a pub, he was half a mile
down the river from the flat.

724
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,749
I mean, ask them, ask the pub.

725
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,459
He'd been in there most of the day.

726
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,839
He was on psychotropic drugs
less than 800 yards from the scene.

727
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,999
No.
He was just drinking.

728
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,499
I sat with him, then I took him back
to Luke's.

729
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,890
I mean, ask them.
Oh, we will.

730
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:24,329
Why has it taken you so long to tell
us all this?

731
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,189
Because he's been in trouble before.

732
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,299
And I know you jump to conclusions.

733
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,820
-Do we?
-Yes.

734
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,920
By "trouble", do you mean killing a
young boy?

735
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,459
He did not kill that boy.
I mean, you must have the file.

736
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,470
Is that what triggered the drug use?

737
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,850
Yes.

738
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,199
If it wasn't for that,
everything would still be normal.

739
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,030
What do you mean by "normal"?

740
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,760
John would have
been home full-time

741
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,510
and my family would
still be under one roof.

742
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,989
John blamed himself for it and so
did I.

743
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,649
We should never have let Billy
drive a car like that.

744
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,889
-So why did you?
-It was a one-off.

745
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,479
John asked Billy to pick him up from
work.

746
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,839
I see, showing off to the workforce,
having Billy the chauffeur.

747
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,679
Maybe. Yes.

748
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,229
He was an idiot for asking

749
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,339
and I was an idiot
for not stepping in.

750
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,440
-It was Billy who was speeding.
-No, he wasn't speeding.

751
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:28,039
Skid marks. How they calculate the
speed.

752
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,599
What I mean is he didn't
know the speed limit.

753
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,079
It's not clear on the road.

754
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,039
Still green on the Highway Code, was
he? Is that how you got him off?

755
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,279
He got off because
it was an accident

756
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,550
and because it's very
clear he has remorse.

757
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,319
He should never have been pursued.

758
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,509
The child was barely visible.

759
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,099
He just ran out into the road.

760
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,089
-So it's the child's fault?
-No.

761
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,299
Obviously not.
I obviously don't think that.

762
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,900
I just think it was an accident
waiting to happen.

763
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,230
Were you estranged from your
husband?

764
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,099
No.

765
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,920
You were living apart.

766
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,859
No.

767
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,620
It was just the commute was eating
into his day.

768
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:21,039
Only he told another witness
that you had split up.

769
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,990
He can't have done that,
because we hadn't.

770
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:31,020
He just threw himself into the
business and needed quiet to work.

771
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,170
You knew he was on antidepressants.

772
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,170
Why would he need antidepressants?

773
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:42,430
He... He was always happy,
always in a good mood.

774
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:49,210
She's on another planet, that woman.

775
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,159
Here, Joe, ring that pub, see if
Billy was there.

776
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,619
The GP reckons John has been on
the medication since 2012.

777
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,369
Right, so dating from
around the time the lad

778
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,100
started going off the rails.

779
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,710
Thanks.

780
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,969
Her whole life is topsy-turvy

781
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,720
and she's still trying to
sell me happy families.

782
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:11,930
Do you know?
I think she believes it.

783
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,049
John Shearwood's birthday party.

784
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:16,420
Found it on the son's phone.

785
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:24,600
They're all there, all the gang.

786
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,889
-When is this?
-June 2011.

787
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,750
A few weeks before the crash.

788
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,470
Are mother and son both in on it?

789
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,229
-Shared effort?
-OK

790
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,399
So what's the shared motive?

791
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,159
Well, you've got me there.

792
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,379
Not doing the dirty.

793
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,379
Not a bloke with a grudge.

794
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:49,230
And the son's in pieces, but the
family are pulling together for him.

795
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:52,050
So what am I missing?

796
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,760
Money?

797
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,939
The geeks have been looking at the
browser history on Shearwood's laptop.

798
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,599
He tried to borrow 15 grand
from an instant-loan website

799
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,709
-the day before he died.
-So desperate for instant cash.

800
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,190
-Why?
-Can only be the debt.

801
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,900
Thanks for that.

802
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,209
The pub reckons Billy
was there from four

803
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,789
until kicking out at
a quarter to three.

804
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:14,239
They remember because his mam
picked him up.

805
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,749
Yeah, but he could have gone back
to the flat after, couldn't he,

806
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,559
when he's off his rocker?

807
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,779
The petrol station have got him buying
fuel at half three in the morning.

808
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,799
-Headed off in the direction of Bickley.
-Kenny? Phone.

809
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,309
They'd have had to come
all the way back in.

810
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:28,619
-What is it?
-Do him in

811
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,220
and then all the way out.

812
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,989
In. Out.
Shake it all about.

813
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,299
It's not plausible, is it?

814
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,709
What'll I do?
I've got Custody on my back.

815
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,259
Well, unless they had
a helicopter come in,

816
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,660
killed him and flew out,
I've got nothing.

817
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,759
Ma'am,
there's a biddy on the phone says

818
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,469
she knows who killed
John Shearwood.

819
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,099
Well, that's good,
cos we don't.

820
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,159
-What? She see it on the telly?
-No.

821
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,919
I would have ignored this,

822
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,010
but she's mentioned
something about decking.

823
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:28,049
-We really appreciate you coming in, love.
-That's all right.

824
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,359
Joe?

825
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,680
So what sort of disturbance?

826
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,719
Every weekend.

827
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,189
Bang, bang, bang!
There's Malachi, f-ing and blinding,

828
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:40,769
shouting he's going to get a chainsaw
and chop his you know whats off.

829
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:43,459
-Malachi?
-I'm sorry? Who is Malachi?

830
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,319
His neighbour.
To the back. I'm opposite.

831
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,869
-And this is up in Laytham?
-Where?

832
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:50,970
-Where do you live, love?
-Lower Denham.

833
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,519
No,
I think we're at cross-purposes.

834
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,749
We're investigating the death of
John Shearwood.

835
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,279
I know.
The removal man.

836
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,879
Well, that's how he started, anyway.

837
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,189
A lovely fella.

838
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,609
-And he's your neighbour in Denham?
-Yes.

839
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,429
He fell out with Malachi
about the noise of the DIY.

840
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:13,489
I'm sorry, love. This is the fella
that we're talking about.

841
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,750
That's him.
Gemma's fiancee.

842
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,389
Just round this corner, I think.

843
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:34,070
Get Uniform to check
on the neighbour,

844
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,930
see if she's batty or not.

845
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,030
Look at this.

846
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:09,310
Is that him hanging
on the back wall?

847
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,700
Yeah, I think it could be.

848
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:18,719
-What did her work say?
-Not seen her since last week.

849
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,260
-What about next door?
-The same.

850
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:22,270
She leaves a key with them.

851
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,999
Well,
I think I've got reasonable ground

852
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,270
to suspect she's missing.

853
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,020
Hello?

854
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:35,810
Hello.

855
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,929
Well, well, well.

856
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:45,810
I think we've found the third party.

857
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,290
Well, he's certainly got his feet
under the table here.

858
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,660
A bank statement.

859
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:03,630
A joint account.
Check that out.

860
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,859
Well, this is all beginning
to make sense, isn't it?

861
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,900
This is where he's been
living during the week.

862
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,899
Nothing fresh.

863
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,650
It's how some people eat,
isn't it?

864
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:24,109
<i>No wonder he's broke.
He's got three houses.</i>

865
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:26,279
<i>Yeah, can you run a check for us?</i>

866
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,419
<i>It's a Gemma Makins,
75, Wardale Drive.</i>

867
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,630
<i>Give us a call back, will you?
Thanks.</i>

868
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,449
How do people have time for an
affair?

869
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:35,750
Affair?

870
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,940
This is a double life.

871
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,709
Yeah, I saw her about a week ago.

872
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,149
Did anything seem unusual?

873
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,869
Yeah. She smiled at me.

874
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:46,739
She's a miserable cow,
normally.

875
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,959
-So, she seemed happy?
-I don't really give her much thought.

876
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,279
You fell out with him, though,
didn't you? Over the noise.

877
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,249
So, right, went to the cops, did
they?

878
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,659
No. John Shearwood has been found
dead.

879
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,969
Christ.

880
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:03,959
Where were you Tuesday night, between
8pm and 7×m Wednesday morning?

881
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,929
I do replenishment
at the super store.

882
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:09,229
They'll have my every single
fart noted down for you.

883
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:12,110
-Well, that's good.
-How long has she lived here for?

884
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,279
A year max, I'd say.

885
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,129
And there was no-one else?
Just...

886
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:19,370
Her and Mr. Man At B&Q.
Yeah. Am I done?

887
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,370
Come on.
Stand by your beds!

888
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,049
Gemma Makins.
See what the lab can match to that.

889
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:04,019
Right. Her account's been emptied.

890
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,419
Everything has been transferred to
a joint account they had in Denham.

891
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,839
-When?
-Monday. Five-ish.

892
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,879
Is this before or after he was on
the fast-loans site?

893
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,720
About half an hour after.
Maybe he was ripping her off.

894
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,129
Any other activity on there?

895
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:22,019
Anything to suggest
where she might be?

896
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,769
Well, there was an
attempt to withdraw cash

897
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,069
two days before
John's body was found.

898
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:27,409
-In London.
-Who by?

899
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,289
I don't know.
Refused on security grounds.

900
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:33,109
Right. Check that out.
Anything else? Family? Friends?

901
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:35,319
Work says she only ever spoke about
John.

902
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,529
They know nothing about her life
before the last year or so.

903
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,990
OK.
Issue a public appeal.

904
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,139
We do that without speaking to the
family first?

905
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:46,849
Our victim's girlfriend has not
been seen since he was murdered?

906
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:48,259
What does that make her?

907
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,769
-A potential witness.
-A potential suspect.

908
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,479
-No.
-A potential second victim.

909
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,619
Yeah. What he said.
What's happened?

910
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,509
Nothing. We're just nipping out to
the Raj.

911
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:01,739
-That's nice.
-I think I might have to rain-check.

912
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,049
No way.
I could murder a curry.

913
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,459
-Who's in?
-I'm in.

914
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,849
Not me. I told you, I've got
parents' evening.

915
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:10,410
Have mercy, boss.
I'm wasting away here.

916
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:14,460
-I trust that includes delivery.
-Yeah, it does.

917
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:17,879
That smells gorgeous.

918
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,849
Yeah, so it should for 50 quid.

919
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:21,159
I make a lovely curry.

920
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,809
You should come to
ours again some time.

921
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:25,479
-It's a treat for the workers.
-I see.

922
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,189
-Cos of bloke in from the Revenue?
-Thanks.

923
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:31,489
Joe said you'd
got yourself an admirer.

924
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:33,910
I don't think I did say that,
Celine.

925
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,039
Why don't you show
her your website?

926
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,800
She wanted you to see it.

927
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,560
Right.

928
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:43,579
-Look at that.
-It's a memorial website.

929
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:45,059
I made a page for Margaret.

930
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,919
Dad said she didn't
have much family.

931
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,579
-So, I thought...
-Well, that's very thoughtful.

932
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,880
What did you say that for?

933
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,170
-Could I have a quick go on that?
-Yeah.

934
00:53:58,350 --> 00:53:59,650
Thanks.

935
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:05,780
I just want to look somebody up.

936
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,910
Gemma Makins -
Ethan Bailey's mother.

937
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:31,500
We need to find her.

938
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:35,989
Right.
I want a full search,

939
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:38,199
looking for evidence of
where she might have gone.

940
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,550
Or anything to put her in contact
with any of...

941
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,749
-Her?
-No.

942
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,219
-What about him?
-No.

943
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,739
Yes.
Him I recognise,

944
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:50,099
hanging around outside,
a couple of hours back.

945
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,499
-Are you sure it was him?
-Yeah, a solemn-looking lad.

946
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,949
Ma'am!

947
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:57,419
Billy has been here since we left.

948
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,920
-Billy?
-OK. Thanks.

949
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,929
The DNA on the hairbrush

950
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,030
matches the bloodstain
in the bathroom.

951
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:06,399
-Have we missed a body?
-Well, not in the flat.

952
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,470
There'd have been more forensics.

953
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,950
Bring Billy back in.

954
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,560
Ma'am?

955
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:27,700
John,
I'm upgrading to a forensic sweep.

956
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:30,749
The guys from the CSI are on their
way over.

957
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,810
See if we can place Billy Shearwood
inside the house.

958
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,210
And if not him, who?
Who else has been there?

959
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,480
OK. OK. I'll phone you later.
I've got to go. Bye.

960
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,839
It's just so blatant,
she must have known.

961
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,229
Stella only sees what she wants to
see.

962
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:54,130
No, I'm talking about the girlfriend.
Did she not know who he was?

963
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:56,809
I doubt it's a coincidence.

964
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,060
It's extra motivation for the wife,
though, ins't it?

965
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,300
A call for you.

966
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,900
-Who is it?
-Owen.

967
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,979
-Owen?
-Something's turned up.

968
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,000
Yeah, you might want to get down
here.

969
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,410
What's happened to John?

970
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,400
-Are you Gemma?
-Where is he?

971
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,189
Look,
I've been everywhere else.

972
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,110
Please, just tell me where he is.

973
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,980
How far along is she,
do you reckon?

974
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:49,279
I'd say about 30 weeks.

975
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,039
Yeah?
What's that in old money?

976
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,660
Seven months-ish.

977
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:54,570
Imminent, then.

978
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,449
A ticking clock.

979
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:58,759
She say where she'd been?

980
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,380
Well, she told my lot she was waiting
for John in London at the hotel.

981
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,519
And he never turned up.

982
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,970
Says they were off
on the Eurostar

983
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,349
to visit a property they'd
bought on the Vendee.

984
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:13,570
Is this your fault?
Was he working for you?

985
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,259
Is that what he said?

986
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,219
He said he was
helping the police.

987
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,540
His business...

988
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,779
was caught up in a fraud.

989
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,739
We're not sure if it was linked to
his death...

990
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,040
Of course it was.

991
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,199
Why do you think that?

992
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,819
He was scared.

993
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,770
That's why he was moving me,

994
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,419
to keep me out of it.

995
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,030
A new life in France, eh?

996
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,999
We exchanged on Monday.

997
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,119
Very nice.

998
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,620
Can I ask you, love,

999
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,329
how long had you been together?

1000
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:46,180
-Two years.
-How did you meet?

1001
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,370
Was it before...

1002
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:52,430
..or after young Ethan died?

1003
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,670
After.

1004
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:57,430
Could you take us through it?

1005
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,299
I don't think you'd understand.

1006
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,500
Come on.
Give us a go.

1007
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:06,689
Look, I don't know how much you know
about what happened to Ethan,

1008
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,830
but it wasn't my fault.

1009
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:13,130
I thought it was at the time.
I'd been working late.

1010
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:17,280
I was on nights and I'd crashed out
on the sofa.

1011
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:20,650
I didn't hear him leave the house.

1012
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,099
Did John... seek you out?

1013
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,400
Or...

1014
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,009
Yeah.

1015
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:31,940
He... He wanted to apologise
for what Billy had done.

1016
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,369
Look, I told him to go away, at
first.

1017
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:39,439
But then he offered to...

1018
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,570
help out with practicalities.

1019
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,140
I was falling apart.

1020
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:47,389
No job. No nothing.

1021
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,430
I wanted to die.

1022
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:54,310
John sort of...saved my life.

1023
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:57,170
So you were friends?

1024
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,240
And then your relationship
developed from there?

1025
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,000
Yeah.

1026
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:07,349
You knew he was still with his wife,
though.

1027
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:10,259
He had to stay until he'd tied up
the money.

1028
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,109
Is that what he told you?

1029
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:13,410
It's the truth.

1030
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,959
Look, it was over.

1031
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,519
She was...
clinging on, I think.

1032
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,909
We were his family now.

1033
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,219
Yeah, but, presumably,

1034
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,519
something had to change,
love, something had to give.

1035
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,689
With the arrival of your bairn.

1036
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:30,729
Exactly. That's why he told her.

1037
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:34,699
Are you telling me Stella knew about
your relationship?

1038
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,169
-He told her on Monday.
-Are you sure?

1039
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:39,670
He told her after the house went
through.

1040
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,469
So John tells Stella.
Stella goes ballistic.

1041
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:51,379
Not necessarily.

1042
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,640
Could have decided to put up with
it.

1043
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:57,349
-You wouldn't, would you?
-Well, people do.

1044
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,849
Some women will turn a
blind eye to anything,

1045
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:01,360
so as not to be alone.

1046
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:05,600
I mean, that's been Stella's story
all along, hasn't it?

1047
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:09,129
Everything is rosy.
Nothing to see here.

1048
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:12,049
I want you to give
the lady a lift home

1049
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,899
and make sure someone
stays with her.

1050
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,369
-Yes, ma'am.
-Now,

1051
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:18,599
there were no calls from John
on Stella's mobile,

1052
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,459
so, if he did tell her Monday,

1053
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,429
it'd have to have been
over the landline, wouldn't it?

1054
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:24,639
-What a coward.
-Fits, though. Doesn't it?

1055
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,940
With him.

1056
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:28,689
Not looking any of it in the eye.

1057
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:30,969
I don't know what's worse,
lying to your family

1058
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:33,439
or falling for the bloke
whose lad killed your son.

1059
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,010
Oh, Joe.

1060
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:36,939
There are some women

1061
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:40,090
who are pen pals
with serial killers.

1062
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,600
Billy!

1063
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,280
Bill!

1064
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:00,089
He's at his uncle's, apparently.
We've sent a team up.

1065
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:01,779
Right, well,
if he's not at Bickley,

1066
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,580
I want an all-ports warning.

1067
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:16,540
Mrs. Shearwood, did you kill
your husband?

1068
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:18,370
Why would I?

1069
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,479
Why?

1070
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,089
He was living with another woman
during the week.

1071
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:26,399
No, he wasn't.

1072
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,229
He was having a relationship
with Gemma Makins.

1073
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:30,830
No, he was not.

1074
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:34,410
Well, they met after Ethan died.

1075
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:39,370
Gemma Makins?

1076
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,040
The mother?

1077
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,579
But we'd never even met her.
We've met her.

1078
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:48,209
And she confirms that is the case.

1079
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:49,959
I don't believe you.

1080
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,019
I would have known if he was living
with someone during the week.

1081
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,949
Oh, really? I thought it was usual
to have no contact?

1082
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:58,150
That was because he was busy.

1083
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:00,750
And she's pregnant.

1084
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:04,489
That proves she's not with John.

1085
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:07,019
I mean, John,
he hated the baby years.

1086
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,150
Why do you think we stopped at one?

1087
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:17,810
And they were planning to set up a
new life together in France.

1088
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:23,010
Right.
Him playing daddy?

1089
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:25,509
Him playing dad in the country,
in...

1090
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,220
It's stupid!

1091
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,810
Well, she didn't know.

1092
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:36,810
That's for sure.

1093
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:41,130
-Does that rule her out?
-Well, she'd need another motive.

1094
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:44,219
And we're sure it
wasn't suicide?

1095
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,999
Only the way things
were crumbling,

1096
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,829
I could understand someone looking
for an exit.

1097
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:49,609
Well, maybe...

1098
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:52,330
Maybe he killed himself...

1099
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:55,320
..and then cleaned the scene.

1100
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:22,509
We're looking for Billy. Is he here?

1101
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,720
I've not seen him
since we were taken in.

1102
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:31,890
If I knew where he was I'd be with
him.

1103
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:39,529
Yeah. Cheers.

1104
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:41,479
Billy's not at his uncle's, either.

1105
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,229
Well, keep 'em searching.

1106
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:44,939
The French place is
still on the market.

1107
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:47,009
Completion was
arranged for Monday,

1108
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:48,499
but the money
never went through.

1109
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,649
Looking at it,
I would say Gemma's cash

1110
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:53,109
just filled a void in
their joint overdraft.

1111
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:55,459
That's why he was trying
to get an instant loan,

1112
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:57,999
-bridge the gap.
-French escape plan foiled.

1113
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,309
Couldn't face the wife.

1114
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:03,289
Or he had no intention of leaving
his missus in the first place.

1115
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:06,049
In that video, he was happy.

1116
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:07,739
At least, back then.

1117
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,769
So maybe Stella's
telling the truth

1118
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:12,009
when she says it
was on the up.

1119
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:15,039
So, what? The French house
was never gonna happen?

1120
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,839
Maybe. Maybe he was betraying Gemma.

1121
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,079
By sticking with his wife.

1122
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,729
I mean, Gemma is not a witness,
she's not a victim,

1123
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:24,310
so what does that make her?

1124
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,080
Right.

1125
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,009
There's a lot of shouting.
I don't know what's going on.

1126
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:03,870
All right, love, all right.

1127
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,559
-Billy!
-Right, Gemma?

1128
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,030
Billy! Billy!

1129
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,949
Calm down!

1130
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:28,659
Just relax and take a seat.

1131
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:29,969
Sit down.

1132
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:32,959
Did you know it was her?
Did you know it was her?

1133
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,819
Billy, I'm sorry,
I know you're in shock.

1134
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,580
But sit down.

1135
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:47,019
You didn't know he was...

1136
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:49,179
I knew he was selfish, but this?

1137
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,510
How could he do this to Mum?

1138
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:02,270
I'm sorry.

1139
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:09,140
I'm sorry for everything.

1140
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,500
Do you have to press charges?

1141
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:40,590
We'll see.

1142
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:44,260
He needs to cool down first.

1143
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:49,509
John loved him.
I don't want him to...

1144
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:51,810
We've all suffered enough.

1145
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,770
We were supposed to be in France
now.

1146
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,480
On our new terrace.

1147
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,460
Having a sundowner.

1148
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,470
Talking out by the pool.

1149
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,659
Did John tell you,

1150
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:08,889
the house purchase fell through,
love?

1151
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:11,730
He'd have told me if there was a
problem.

1152
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,739
On Monday afternoon,

1153
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:19,310
a French bank tried to take the
funds out of your joint account.

1154
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,730
But it was overdrawn.

1155
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:25,149
What, by a hundred quid?

1156
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:26,450
No.

1157
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,970
It was more like thousands.

1158
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,720
He'd have had a...
plan.

1159
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:35,670
He wouldn't just leave me high and
dry.

1160
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,769
We were practically married.

1161
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:44,510
You don't seem to understand that.

1162
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,329
Poor girl.

1163
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:50,630
Yeah.

1164
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:55,250
Why do women fall for these charming
types?

1165
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:59,999
Over and over,
you see good woman with bad men.

1166
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,490
Don't tar us all with the same
brush.

1167
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:08,800
Talking of charming,
it's Kenny.

1168
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:10,510
You all right?

1169
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:14,469
The London hotel confirms
that Gemma was there.

1170
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:16,820
-How is Billy?
-What about Billy?

1171
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:21,190
Just waiting on the FME.

1172
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,089
The solicitor is insisting
on another impairment test.

1173
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,539
Of course he is.

1174
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:28,090
Thanks, Kenny.

1175
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:33,020
Get in.

1176
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:43,409
Now, the accident,
her little boy killed,

1177
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:45,540
it triggered everything, didn't it?

1178
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:50,370
All this trouble, I think,
started with that.

1179
01:09:57,670 --> 01:10:01,140
Billy is on his way to pick up his
dad from work.

1180
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:05,550
Young Ethan crossing the road to his
mates.

1181
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:09,610
Billy doing 40,
he didn't stand a chance.

1182
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:17,249
What was he doing here, Billy, do
you reckon?

1183
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:20,430
-He must have got lost.
-A short cut?

1184
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:23,970
Wait a minute.

1185
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:28,059
So the lad runs out into the road.

1186
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:30,050
Billy hits him.

1187
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:34,239
He's scooped up into the ambulance.

1188
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,070
Over there.

1189
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:39,709
Now the skid marks...

1190
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:43,949
..are going from left to right,
so he's travelling...

1191
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:45,869
in that direction.

1192
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:47,739
Get lost, coppers!

1193
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:49,379
Just ignore 'em.

1194
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:51,530
They're showing off to their mates.

1195
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,630
Which way is the depot from here?

1196
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,440
That way.

1197
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:05,780
So speeding or not...

1198
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:09,570
..he's travelling in the wrong
direction.

1199
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:15,090
Come on.

1200
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:35,159
They're letting you roam the
streets, then?

1201
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,749
Yeah. Thank God.

1202
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:41,450
Well, the more you give 'em,
the better it'll look to the jury.

1203
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,440
I know, I...

1204
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:47,860
I wasn't at it to hurt John.

1205
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,220
I just needed the money. I...

1206
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:53,619
As soon as I started,
I wanted to stop.

1207
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:55,389
He'd done a lot for me.

1208
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:58,870
Yeah, I wanted to ask you
about your divorce proceedings.

1209
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:02,199
Why have you got that?

1210
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,509
You see,
for a while,

1211
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:07,000
we thought you might have been
having a relationship with Stella.

1212
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:09,019
You what?

1213
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,379
I get it. No love lost.

1214
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:13,969
But John was your mate,
wasn't he?

1215
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:16,849
Through thick and thin,
John stood by you.

1216
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:19,909
Even paid your legal fees,
according to these papers.

1217
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:22,799
He did, yeah,
he was good like that.

1218
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,119
Yeah, now...

1219
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,280
I thought he was a "selfish
bastard".

1220
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:32,570
I said that when I was angry.

1221
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,210
Because this...

1222
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:39,070
that's going the extra mile,
isn't it?

1223
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,699
So, when you went to see him Tuesday
to confess...

1224
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:48,050
..to ask him to turn a blind eye
to your goings-on...

1225
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:51,449
..was it because he's a good bloke?

1226
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,490
Or was it because...

1227
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:56,980
..you had something over him?

1228
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:00,240
No.

1229
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,950
Like I said, the more you tell us...

1230
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,270
..the better it'll look.

1231
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:17,239
Shep!

1232
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:20,119
Have they done the tests?
Yeah, but he won't speak.

1233
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,539
Still in shock.

1234
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:25,110
Well, brace yourself, lad,
it's going to get a whole lot worse.

1235
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,259
So, tell me,

1236
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:32,599
who was driving the car
that hit Ethan Bailey?

1237
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,309
The facts of the crash
have been investigated.

1238
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,149
You don't have to answer that.

1239
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:39,189
You weren't on your
way to the depot

1240
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:41,670
to pick up your dad
when it happened. Were you?

1241
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:47,489
You were on your way
back from the depot,

1242
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:50,059
having already picked him up.

1243
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:51,719
And, what's more,

1244
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,349
Mark Donovan has just
confirmed he saw your dad

1245
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:57,850
get into the driving seat.

1246
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,109
He also told me
that he and your dad

1247
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:04,029
were enjoying some
beers with the workers.

1248
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:07,510
Party time!
Celebrating some award.

1249
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:11,810
So was your dad in the car with you?

1250
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:17,649
Was your father...

1251
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:19,519
drunk-driving,

1252
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,730
when he killed Ethan Bailey?

1253
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:48,279
Dad had points for speeding.

1254
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,409
I had a clean licence.

1255
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:52,490
We thought Ethan was only injured.

1256
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,100
I mean...

1257
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:55,930
he could talk.

1258
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,400
He could...
cry.

1259
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:05,090
But he got worse in the ambulance.

1260
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,559
There weren't any witnesses.

1261
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,130
Dad left before anyone arrived.

1262
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:14,009
I told the police I was driving the
car on my own.

1263
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,370
Did your dad ask you to do that?

1264
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,919
It was my own idea.

1265
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,269
He went along with it, though,
didn't he?

1266
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:24,120
I just didn't want him to get into
trouble.

1267
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:28,509
And I bet it was a shock
when you heard Ethan had died

1268
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:31,460
and you're faced with a manslaughter
charge.

1269
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:33,070
Yeah.

1270
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:36,880
We had no idea that would happen.

1271
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,900
At least Dad said he had no idea.

1272
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:45,819
I don't know what to believe.

1273
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:48,979
Why did you go into town
the night your dad died?

1274
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:51,180
Sometimes, I'm fine.

1275
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:55,730
Sometimes, it boils over
and I want to kick his head in.

1276
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:58,069
It ruined my life.

1277
01:15:58,070 --> 01:16:00,640
Everyone thinking I'd done
something.

1278
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:03,679
Even by accident.

1279
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,589
You could see them thinking...

1280
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:08,610
So did it boil over that night?

1281
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:12,410
If I'd killed my father, I'd tell
you.

1282
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:16,920
I've nothing left to lose.

1283
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,430
I don't believe you.

1284
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:32,770
John would never let that happen.

1285
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,740
I mean, no father would do that.

1286
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,650
He loved us.

1287
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:51,059
He would never sacrifice...

1288
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:52,930
his own son.

1289
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:00,310
Did you know about this?

1290
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:03,110
No.

1291
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:10,540
No, I didn't.

1292
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:15,369
-We're offsky.
-Right.

1293
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:16,899
Sorry if we got in your hair.

1294
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:20,559
For what it's worth,
Mark gave us the names we wanted.

1295
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,410
So no more bargain Grouse for me,
then?

1296
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:26,849
-Do you know when the funeral might be?
-No.

1297
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:30,149
Sad. I can't square it
with the guy I knew.

1298
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:33,289
Did he really let his lad shoulder
all that?

1299
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:36,279
Well, self-preservation,
that's the first instinct.

1300
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,929
How do you know all that?

1301
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:40,339
Have you been sniffing
around my incident room?

1302
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:41,649
Kenny.

1303
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:44,749
But even under pressure,
to lay all that on your kid?

1304
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:48,539
Well, the damage was already done.
There was no going back on that.

1305
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:51,059
Why did no-one know, at the time,
he was driving?

1306
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:54,110
Well, the lad was going berserk,
he looked guilty.

1307
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:55,920
A distraction.

1308
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:06,130
Joe...

1309
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:09,949
You said the bloke at
the Italian ID'd John

1310
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:11,409
as having picked up his car,
right?

1311
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:13,899
-Yeah.
-Well, will you double-check that?

1312
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:17,159
Only, on the security footage,
at the flat,

1313
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:20,399
we only see his car,
not his face.

1314
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,709
OK.

1315
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:25,419
I mean, why are we thinking this
happened on Tuesday night?

1316
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:28,540
Why? Because that's the last-known
sighting.

1317
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:31,169
But it's not a sighting of him,
is it?

1318
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:33,339
It's a sighting of his car.

1319
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:36,000
How do we know who was driving?

1320
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:38,800
I mean, say, in this period...

1321
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:42,149
..he's not missing.

1322
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:44,029
But already dead.

1323
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:47,059
Hang on.
A neighbour heard buzzing at nine.

1324
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,779
Yeah, but he didn't answer,
did he?

1325
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:50,869
And his last text was sent at 7:50,

1326
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:52,809
which was his lie that he'd
just arrived in Dublin.

1327
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:54,639
Yeah, well,
what if he never sent it?

1328
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,449
What if the killer got
his phone and sent it?

1329
01:18:57,450 --> 01:18:59,700
-So who?
-Someone responsible.

1330
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:04,410
Someone who knew Stella
needed reassurance.

1331
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:08,810
And here's Billy thinking
he's got nothing left to lose.

1332
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:12,770
He does, doesn't he?
He does.

1333
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,860
Sorry it's late.

1334
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:04,509
We just wanted to check a detail.

1335
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:05,819
Yeah. Sure.

1336
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:09,609
What time did you leave for Berwick
on Tuesday?

1337
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:10,919
I don't know.

1338
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:14,259
Well, you checked into
the hotel at 8:30pm.

1339
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:16,569
A couple of hours drive, max.

1340
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:18,519
So, yeah, maybe six-ish.

1341
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:23,349
So not really "most" of Tuesday,
is it?

1342
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:25,079
Did I say that?

1343
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,150
Yeah, you did.

1344
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,479
And we're guessing...

1345
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:34,640
to put yourself as far from John's
flat as possible.

1346
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:39,320
Stella mentioned that he was
off to Ireland to play golf.

1347
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:42,790
Which was obviously a lie.

1348
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,510
On his own for a week?
Yeah, right.

1349
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,230
But she has her head in the sand, as
ever.

1350
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,729
So you went to see
him Monday night,

1351
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:56,239
to confront him about the affair?

1352
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,860
No. No.
It's worse than that.

1353
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:02,269
The car crash,
it wasn't...

1354
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:04,439
Billy who killed Ethan.

1355
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,529
-It was...
-John. Yes, we know.

1356
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:08,470
How long have you known?

1357
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:10,530
Not long.

1358
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:15,710
The day before, I think.
I lost it with Billy.

1359
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,799
He got himself a stash.

1360
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,570
He was laughing and...

1361
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:23,840
cross-eyed and legless.

1362
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,859
I lost my temper with him.

1363
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:29,489
I told him he should be ashamed of
himself.

1364
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:31,529
He'd had everything
handed to him on a plate

1365
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:33,909
and this is how he
repays his poor parents?

1366
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:36,370
So that's how it all came out?

1367
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,090
How did you react?

1368
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:41,480
I couldn't believe it.

1369
01:21:42,990 --> 01:21:45,320
I knew John could be selfish,

1370
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:47,979
but this was Billy.

1371
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:50,290
I'm only his uncle,
but...

1372
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:54,080
Take us through what happened
when you got there.

1373
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:56,560
He'd been on the wine.

1374
01:21:57,510 --> 01:22:00,000
I think he'd had a boozy lunch at
Rodolfo's.

1375
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:02,400
Even left his car there.

1376
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:06,579
He was still drinking,
back at the flat.

1377
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:09,870
Did he confess to the affair or
killing Ethan?

1378
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:11,560
No.

1379
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:13,770
He denied all of it.

1380
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:18,549
I lost it then. I lost it.

1381
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:20,839
Just the barefacedness of it.

1382
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:23,070
Yeah, but how did he die?

1383
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:28,370
I told him I was going to get
the whole thing out in the open.

1384
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:30,929
He went ballistic.

1385
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:32,910
He put his hands around my throat.

1386
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:36,000
I honestly thought that he was...

1387
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:41,840
I pushed him away.

1388
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:50,670
He went for me again.

1389
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:55,050
He hit his head on the glass.
He was OK. He was dazed.

1390
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,560
I tried to help him up.

1391
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:01,760
And then he swung for me.

1392
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:04,790
And I...
pushed him.

1393
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:07,330
You pushed him...

1394
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:10,830
..over the balcony, hm?

1395
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:15,000
Accidentally, I swear.

1396
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:17,980
I thought no-one will believe this.

1397
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,589
I panicked.
And...

1398
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:23,890
You put his body into the river.

1399
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:28,269
I nearly called you. I nearly did.

1400
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:31,479
But, instead, you just carried on as
normal.

1401
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:34,890
And the next day, off you went to
Berwick.

1402
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:38,979
But not before picking up his car
from the restaurant.

1403
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:40,879
And driving it back to his place,

1404
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,020
so it would look
like he'd returned.

1405
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:50,110
Have a look at this.

1406
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:55,709
See the broken skin on the knuckles?

1407
01:23:55,710 --> 01:23:57,949
It suggests that he hit
someone.

1408
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,650
Perhaps he hit you first.

1409
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,689
-He did.
-You could have claimed self-defence.

1410
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:06,570
If you'd just left the body and come
to us.

1411
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:09,879
Left the scene intact.

1412
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,900
That's how it happened.

1413
01:24:14,910 --> 01:24:17,220
I didn't think it would kill him.

1414
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:21,019
-I swear.
-It didn't...

1415
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:22,560
kill him.

1416
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:26,510
He was still alive when he went into
the water.

1417
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:29,110
I don't believe you.

1418
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:32,650
But the shoelaces you tied
together...

1419
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:36,359
..now that would have held him back.

1420
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,660
Please...

1421
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:41,049
Tell me that's not true.

1422
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:42,699
Sorry, love.

1423
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,000
I can't.

1424
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:46,730
No.

1425
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,070
I don't believe it.

1426
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,520
Well done, Uniform.

1427
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:54,209
See?
Not all the same.

1428
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:56,110
Good lad.

1429
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,820
A memento.

1430
01:26:11,610 --> 01:26:12,919
One each.

1431
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,629
-For you. And for you.
-Thank you.

1432
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:17,570
That's very kind.

1433
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:25,589
Yeah, well, I suppose you did help
me out a little bit.

1434
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:26,899
Well...

1435
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:29,489
nudged me in the right direction,
anyway, so...

1436
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:31,369
-Thanks very much.
-Well...

1437
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:33,770
-High praise, indeed.
-Well.

1438
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,900
Do you...

1439
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:40,819
Do you fancy going out for a coffee?

1440
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:43,670
-You what?
-Well, to celebrate.

1441
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:47,379
-With coffee?
-OK. OK.

1442
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:48,999
Coffee for me.

1443
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,479
-Do you not drink?
-I'm in recovery.

1444
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:53,230
-Are you?
-So how about it, then?

1445
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:55,040
Saturday?

1446
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:58,390
Bugger!

1447
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:03,050
Joe's missus has invited me over for
lunch on Saturday.

1448
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:06,619
OK.
Another time, then.

1449
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:08,799
-Yeah. Maybe.
-Yeah. OK.

1450
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,389
-Yeah. Thanks.
-OK?

1451
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:11,810
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

1452
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:18,719
-You're never coming round to ours, are you?
-No, I'm not.

1453
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:21,110
I like being on my own,
don't I?

1454
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:43,200

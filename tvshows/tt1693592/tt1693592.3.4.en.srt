00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,500
-There you go.
-Thanks very much.

2
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,750
<i>Safe journey.</i>

3
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,370
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,129
So, er...
how did you get this?

5
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,810
I saved a drowning kitten.

6
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,109
I don't like men who fight.

7
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,800
But you like me,
don't you?

Do you wanna go
somewhere quieter?

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,460
Already?

11
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,400
I've got a flat round the corner.

12
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,549
Give us a sec to tell the others
where I'm at.

13
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,150
I'll wait for you outside.

14
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,250
You've pulled!

15
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,110
He's nice.

16
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,459
This flat of yours better have
decent heating

17
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,750
or my clothes are staying on.

"Prodigal Son"
Season Finale

22
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,650
-What have we got?
-A stabbing.

23
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,399
There's no ID just yet.

24
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,450
A perfect end to the evening.

25
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,450
No phone, no wallet, no cash.

26
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,249
He did have a set of keys,
car and home.

27
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,129
We're sending them for prints.

28
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,550
See if there were any other muggings
around here last night.

29
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,149
He's 35 to 40.

30
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,279
He's having a drink in the bar.

31
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,350
He steps outside, meets some lass
that he just pulled.

32
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,519
He got knifed in
the two minutes

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,350
it took her to come
out and join him.

34
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,899
He died before the paramedics could
get here.

35
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,200
CCTV?

36
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,309
Control have got the main street
covered.

37
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,559
And the bar have got some inside
but there's nothing down here.

38
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,790
Stroke of luck for our killer,
or he knew what he was doing.

39
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,029
Nothing the other side of
the alley, either,

40
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,190
just side streets and
derelict flats.

41
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,130
So our killer comes in and out and
we haven't got a sighting.

42
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,339
Search team are
looking for the weapon.

43
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,640
And the lass?

44
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,699
She's inside.

45
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,349
Janna Jeffries,
a veterinary student.

46
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,750
She cannae stop crying.

47
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,399
Guilty conscience?

48
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,140
Trust me,
she's not our killer.

49
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,879
You cry all you like, love.

50
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,590
-I didn't. I never...
-You didn't...stab him?

51
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,490
-No, I wouldn't.
-Of course you didn't.

52
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,370
So you were in here drinking, is
that right?

53
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,470
Having a bit of fun after a busy
day, nothing wrong with that.

54
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,880
And you met this fella?

55
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,220
He was nice.

56
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,499
What was his name?

57
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,350
-John.
-John?

58
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,380
That's good.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,520
Anything else -
his full name, perhaps?

60
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,410
Hey, I know it's a bit raw but
you're really helping me here.

61
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,140
Did John tell you anything else about
himself while you were chatting?

62
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,330
It wasn't that sort of chat.

63
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,050
He said he had a flat nearby.

64
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,019
Where?

65
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,759
A couple of minutes away.

66
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,359
Walking, taxi, what?

67
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,450
It was just something he said.

68
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,290
"I live nearby, let's go there for
a... cuddle, sort of thing."

69
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,700
Did you see anyone follow him out
when he left the bar ahead of you?

70
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,049
No?

71
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,389
Did you see anyone outside
or hear anyone?

72
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,470
Someone running away, perhaps?

73
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,410
If you think of anything else,
love...

74
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,110
Anything at all.

75
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,339
No weapon yet.

76
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,959
Have you got me a full name?

77
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,659
No, nothing more than a John.

78
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,279
He's a regular, though.

79
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,509
One of Janna's mates.
who was out with her tonight,

80
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,669
Carrie Kinsdale, is a waitress.

81
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,990
Reckons she served him
in a restaurant
and he came onto her
a couple of months ago.

82
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,920
So a bit of a ladies' man?

83
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,089
That's what's coming through.

84
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,279
Regular face, always alone,
always on the pull.

85
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,059
No one knows his full name.

86
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,920
He told Janna he lived nearby.

87
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,400
Let's see those keys.

88
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,679
-Do we recognise the make?
-There's no logo.

89
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,969
I've sent a photo to
Traffic to identify it.

90
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,080
If he lived nearby...

91
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,350
maybe he parked nearby.

92
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,999
The traffic boys reckon
it's likely to be a BMW 5 Series.

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,749
If it is, there's a registered
1,200 owners in Newcastle,

94
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,359
but only seven called John.

95
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,809
I like those odds.

96
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,119
Or it could be a 3 Series,

97
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,549
in which case we're looking
at another 16 Johns.

98
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,240
But, of course,
if it turns out to be...

99
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,159
We've found the car.
Run these plates.

100
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,789
Sierra, Whiskey, 11, Foxtrot,
Uniform, Tango.

101
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,180
It's a black BMW.

102
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,430
Ma'am.

103
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,650
Now here he is...

104
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,920
..our friend John.

105
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,229
Looking around...

106
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,949
and then he goes down the alley.

107
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,600
Does he know there's no CCTV
coverage down there?

108
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,530
Or is it a coincidence?

109
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,990
Now, why does he go down the alley?

110
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,259
Maybe he's seen somebody
he knows - the killer, maybe.

111
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,000
Here comes the vet, 4 minutes
7 seconds after he came out.

112
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,249
She's looking for her date.

113
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,610
Where is he?

114
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,259
There he is.

115
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,569
And down she goes.

116
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,460
And 28 seconds later...

117
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,540
The poor love, look at her.

118
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,359
Right, so who is he,
why was he stabbed?

119
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,979
The car you found's
not registered with DVLA.

120
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,639
-At least, not with those plates.
-That's dodgy.

121
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,829
And what about the 6,000 in notes
found in the boot?

122
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,389
-Have Forensics lifted prints?
-Not yet.

123
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,439
Data Recovery have made a start
on the mobile phones

124
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,279
-but they all have prepaid SIMs.
-Untraceable.

125
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,449
Yeah. The call logs have been wiped
from most of them.

126
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,039
But one has a call history
to a single number,

127
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,489
made November last year.

128
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,709
-Whose number?
-It's a mobile, no answer yet.

129
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,180
Generic voicemail.

130
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,889
A man with false plates on a car

131
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,529
that's full of surprises

132
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,900
gets stabbed down an alley
with no CCTV.

133
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,840
This isn't a random mugging.

134
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,049
A single stab in the back,
hit the abdominal aorta.

135
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,589
Professional job?

136
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,529
Lovely bit of work if it was.
Very efficient.

137
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,699
It could also be that
some stab-happy mugger

138
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,689
unintentionally climbed
the career ladder.

139
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,859
The knife? Three-inch standard
kitchen or pocket blade.

140
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,909
Which puts our chances of tracing
it at less than bugger all.

141
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,359
Except that the gods of pathology

142
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,769
have lobbed you several gifts
to keep you interested.

143
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,549
-What?
-He's broken his collarbone,

144
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,559
cracked a couple of
ribs a few months back.

145
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,279
-How?
-Hard to say -

146
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,289
he fell off his bike
or got into a fight...

147
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,410
-I need a timeframe, Billy.
-Yes, it's always tricky with bones.

148
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,689
Between eight and 11 weeks ago.

149
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,509
And he would have gone to A&E
with those injuries?

150
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,569
Definitely.
If only for the joys of opiates

151
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,329
and predatory nurses.

152
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,389
And any other news?

153
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,389
The knife left a slight oil residue
at the point of entry, eucalyptus.

154
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,769
-Eucalyptus?
-Mostly in salt,

155
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,659
-massage oil, I'll make you a list.
-What's that doing on the knife?

156
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,929
Maybe someone used the oil and
knife in their line of work.

157
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,200
-Who?
-Psychotic aromatherapist?

158
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,619
Hey, not seen the best bit.

159
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,149
And for this one,
you will love me.

160
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,599
That's from his leg -
old, old injury.

161
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,949
Knitted his broken femur.

162
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,090
Now,
we're talking years ago here.

163
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,849
Kenny, job for you.

164
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,319
This was taken from the victim's
leg.

165
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,989
There's a serial number
and with any luck,

166
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,000
the NHS can give us a full name.

167
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,569
So what else do we know?
Diddly-squat.

168
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,489
There's no match from Missing
Persons overnight.

169
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,609
But there were three
muggings with violences

170
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,679
and six assaults in the vicinity.

171
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,350
-I could chase those.
-Right.

172
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,179
And lost property.

173
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,489
I mean,
it'd be a miracle,

174
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,589
but maybe they found
his phone and wallet.

175
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,349
And keep trying that mobile.

176
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,950
I want a name.

177
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,939
-Ma'am.
-This witness,

178
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,070
Carrie Kinsdale, the waitress.
Did you interview her?

179
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,710
No, Uniform.
Why?

180
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,559
It might be worth getting a more
detailed statement at some stage.

181
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,759
Ma'am, sorry. I got a trace
from the mobile.

182
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,429
Agnes Lennox.
She thinks she knows where he lives.

183
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,019
I hardly knew him, really.

184
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,209
His phone records show
he called you quite a lot.

185
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,690
Well, he chatted me up here,
we ended up going to his place.

186
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,380
That's how it carried on.

187
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,419
Not my finest hour.

188
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,040
-Is it far?
-No, not far.

189
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,579
So you were seeing each other?

190
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,839
Well, that's a dignified way of
putting it.

191
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,469
We met three or four times -
never in the light.

192
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,279
When was the last
time you saw him?

193
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,589
A month ago.

194
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,789
Although he kept
calling long after.

195
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,689
And you didn't answer?

196
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,709
Well,
loads of blokes are like that.

197
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,169
Ignore 'em,
they go away eventually.

198
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,879
Got any idea why he had a phone
specifically for you?

199
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,189
Meaning?

200
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,459
Yours is the only number
he would call.

201
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,519
That doesn't surprise me.
He was a bit weird.

202
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,799
-Weird? How?
-There are rules to our type of encounter.

203
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,749
A couple of texts is fine,
but a load of calls is out of order.

204
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,939
Do you know what he did for a living,
his full name perhaps?

205
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,240
No.

206
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,769
We weren't conversationalists.

207
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,200
But, look, this could be a bit
embarrassing for me at work.

208
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,190
I'm happy to help
but I'd appreciate your discretion.

209
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,590
You can call me on this number.

210
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,319
Corporate lawyer?

211
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,220
Not as exciting as it sounds.

212
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,310
It's there,
green door.

213
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,970
His flat.

214
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,059
Thanks, love.

215
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,980
He wasn't really my type but...

216
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,240
This is horrible.

217
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,539
Nothing.

218
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,870
No letters, not even a gas bill.

219
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,720
Like pinning a ghost to the wall.

220
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,709
Well,
here's a surprise.

221
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,819
His name's John F Warnock,
DC.

222
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,830
So what's he doing getting
stabbed on my patch?

223
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,949
John Francis Warnock.

224
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,569
Grew up on a farm
in Sleekburn,

225
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,969
trained locally,

226
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,679
then spent 12 years with the
CID in London.

227
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,539
I spoke to the Met -
good record, well respected.

228
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,159
A proper copper.

229
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,849
But he didn't get promoted.

230
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,349
It's not everybody
that wants to climb the greasy pole.

231
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,589
So was he working a
case here or what?

232
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,789
Nדo, he was invalided out
nine months ago, sciatica.

233
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,099
He's a private citizen.

234
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,089
We think he came back home
about the same time.

235
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,909
Next of kin is Mabel Warnock,

236
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,209
74,
still listed at the farm.

237
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,879
Well,
you lot have been busy!

238
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,870
He's one of us.
We'd do the same for you.

239
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,930
Until that happy day,
Kenny...

240
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,309
..check out his most recent cases,
see if anyone is holding a grudge.

241
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,779
He worked murders, rapes, robberies.

242
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,139
He's never a lead player so

243
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,869
it's unlikely it's
a revenge attack.

244
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,629
He had secret SIMs, false plates, a
bag of notes.

245
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,499
And holding onto his warrant card.

246
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,509
He was up to something,
keep digging.

247
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,379
I found some bank details.

248
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,399
Nothing suspicious so far.

249
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,639
Solid balance,
a couple of big payments

250
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,029
I'm trying to trace.

251
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,939
And a monthly wage from Finches.

252
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,779
Finches, the brewery?

253
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,690
He'd been working there for
five months.

254
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,310
-Check that out.
-Ma'am.

255
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,159
Any news on the 6,000?

256
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,539
Not yet.

257
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,479
The NHS couldn't get a make
on the rod in his leg.

258
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,929
But I phoned the manufacturer,

259
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,889
who sold it to a hospital in
Bucharest over five years ago.

260
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,199
Bucharest?

261
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,290
What's he doing busting
his leg in Bucharest?

262
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,690
-Can I help you?
-Is the owner around, love?

263
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,099
One more time on this leg.

264
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,589
We're looking for Mabel Warnock.

265
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,410
Yeah, that's good.

266
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,950
I'm afraid my mother passed away
in January.

267
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,989
I'm DCI Vera Stanhope,
Northumberland and City Police.

268
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,870
This is my sergeant,
Joe Ashworth.

269
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,660
Could we have a word, love?

270
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,950
He'd only just come back to us.

271
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,410
12 years.

272
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,439
I wish I'd seen him more.

273
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,980
But we were always friends, you
know?

274
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,020
How good to have him home.

275
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,929
My mam was dying.

276
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,949
He'd got his injury.

277
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,830
He needed to be back here.

278
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,300
Stabbed.
Just why?

279
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,430
Well, we were hoping that you might
be able to help us with that.

280
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,749
We didn't really talk.
He was one of those.

281
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,150
Strong,
uncommunicative.

282
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,810
And he could be a grumpy sod.

283
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,489
That comes with the job, I'm afraid,
love.

284
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,780
I was hoping he was gonna become
more involved with us all.

285
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,139
I'm getting married.

286
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,089
Congratulations.

287
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:30,480
My fiance, Sam, and his daughter,
they run the brewery.

288
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,089
We wondered why he was working
at Finches.

289
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,090
So it wasn't because he needed
the money or anything?

290
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,089
You get proper pensions,
don't you?

291
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,399
And he had half of this place.

292
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,690
No, he only had to ask
if he needed that sort of help.

293
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,209
I understand he broke
a couple of ribs recently.

294
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,350
Do you know anything about that?

295
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,439
He turned up to my birthday
with his face punched in.

296
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,799
-When was that?
-January 5th.

297
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,040
Something had happened the night
before. I asked but...

298
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,900
he wouldn't say.

299
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,690
We're very sorry, love.

300
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,240
Do you think it's because of his...

301
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,949
He had a lot of girlfriends.

302
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,440
Did any of them have husbands,
boyfriends?

303
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,900
I didn't know any of the details.

304
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,620
I just always wanted him
to settle down.

305
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,620
He was my baby brother!

306
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,649
Did it seem odd to you
he worked in a brewery?

307
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,850
Maggie was bringing him
back into the family.

308
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,789
What would you do if you were forced
into early retirement?

309
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,740
Take up skydiving.
Don't you know me at all?

310
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,959
He was a young lad, it's not strange
he'd want to get back into employment.

311
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,219
But as a guard in a beer factory?

312
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,649
Maybe he wanted a quiet life.

313
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,750
That would account for the untraced
phones and the 6,000 in notes.

314
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,879
Maggie called me.
I was about to head over.

315
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,189
Right.

316
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,680
Well, we won't keep you long,
Mr. Harper.

317
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,840
Eva will be here in a minute.

318
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,019
She's much closer to all the staff.

319
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,769
Your daughter works here?

320
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,209
Proper family firm.

321
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,579
No, I married into it.

322
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,599
Came for an interview in 1988,
fell for the boss's daughter.

323
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,750
I understand you're remarrying.

324
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,439
Yes.
My...

325
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,710
My wife Jenny died 18 years ago.

326
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,149
Were you the sole beneficiary?

327
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,230
-Yes - well, myself and Eva.
-Just the two of you?

328
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,190
How did you get on with John?

329
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,930
Well,
he wasn't here long.

330
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,499
I think he found me and Maggie
boring.

331
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,209
We were settling down,
he was playing the field.

332
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,590
Is it true about John?

333
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,070
I'm afraid so.

334
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,870
Dad, poor Maggie.

335
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,439
We'll do all we can to help.

336
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,299
Anything, of course.

337
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,499
I've already told the staff that
you might need to speak to them.

338
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,800
Well done.

339
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,899
Maybe you could show
us where John worked,

340
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,450
just to kick us off?

341
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,170
Thanks.

342
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,640
So in the brew house
is where we extract

343
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,859
the sugars from some of Yorkshire's
premium malted barley.

344
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,229
Then we boil the brew
with the finest Kentish hops...

345
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,989
and ferment with Finches' own yeast.

346
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,450
Look, I'm not after a
guided tour, pet.

347
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,899
Bit of a coup for the company,

348
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,900
having a former detective
as a security guard.

349
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,969
Could he have been selling
your stock on the side?

350
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,570
-You know, back of a lorry?
-No way.

351
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,829
You seem very sure of his character.

352
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,549
I know the stock.

353
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,090
Exactly how much we produce
and how much we're owed.

354
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,329
What is your job?

355
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,789
Dad does strategy and I do
everything else.

356
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,090
But we've never had a problem
with theft.

357
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,710
That's lucky.

358
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,050
Did John have a locker?

359
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,449
So he was trying to get close to the
three of you by working here?

360
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,910
That was the idea.

361
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,239
He asked Maggie
if he could come,

362
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,139
but then he never
really took part.

363
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,089
More interested in his night life
than putting in a proper shift.

364
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,109
Yeah, I gathered he turned up to her
birthday after being in the wars.

365
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,069
A grown man getting into fights.

366
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,379
So it was a fight?

367
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,880
I don't imagine he fell
of a bicycle, do you?

368
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,880
Shall I do it, love?

369
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,990
What was he doing at the quayside?

370
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,220
He was with a lass he'd met.

371
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,390
I gather he likes a bit of company.

372
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,690
Still, handsome fella.

373
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,960
Did he ever try it on with you?

374
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,570
No.

375
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,890
What a lovely smell of beer.

376
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,640
What goes on in here, then, love?

377
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,059
These are the maturation vessels.

378
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,490
Basically, where we age the beer.

379
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,050
Where were you Tuesday night?

380
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,689
I was at a party with my dad and
Maggie over by the racecourse.

381
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,809
-What, Gosforth?
-There's a hotel attached.

382
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,309
It was a breeders' function.

383
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,920
That's a hot ticket.

384
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,569
It was a big night for Maggie,
lots of business networking.

385
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,350
We were just happy to support her.

386
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,750
But John wasn't there.

387
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,470
-No.
-His sister's big night?

388
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,460
Well, if he turned up to her
birthday with his face smashed in,

389
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,500
maybe she didn't want him at
her networking night.

390
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,889
We need to find out what happened
on the 4th.

391
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,829
He bust his ribs, collarbone, face
and nobody knows how.

392
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,780
He's not the sort for an innocent
accident.

393
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,089
And I don't think Harper's his
biggest fan.

394
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,779
Get Shep down to the hospital,

395
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,269
talk to anyone who was on duty that
night.

396
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,260
If it was a fight in the city
centre, we might have CCTV.

397
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,189
What's he doing hanging around in
bars, getting into scraps?

398
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,159
Maybe he's just bored.

399
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,939
He used to be a detective, all that
adrenaline, and now he's just here.

400
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,850
It doesn't square.

401
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,630
Kenny?

402
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,180
Ten minutes.

403
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,380
Someone just used Warnock's
credit card.

404
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,440
Ma'am,
CCTV's just come in.

405
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,330
Turn round, turn round.

406
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,300
-What, do you know him?
-Yeah, Reece.

407
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,189
He's a street thief.

408
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,190
And I know where we'll find him.

409
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,859
<i>-This his hideout?
-Aye.</i>

410
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,859
<i>It's good to know
we're pitting our wits</i>

411
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,950
against a criminal genius!

412
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,579
Oi!

413
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,880
Oi!

414
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,920
Oi, stop!

415
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,980
Hey!

416
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,370
Stay down!
Stay there!

417
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,590
Home from home.

418
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,210
I need to let my birds out.
They need exercising.

419
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,650
Recognise this fella?

420
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,549
Cos he was robbed
and fatally stabbed

421
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,189
outside Tuxedos, Tuesday night.

422
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,490
So?

423
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,650
This your wallet?

424
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,530
You used his credit card
on Darnley Street at 15:34.

425
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,550
That's this dead bloke's card?

426
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,139
This dead bloke
is a former policeman.

427
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,549
So where were you, Tuesday 11:30pm?

428
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,999
-I were nowhere near Tuxedos.
-That's not what I asked.

429
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,829
I lifted his card,
OK, a couple of days ago.

430
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,369
Gonna tell us a story now?
Where's his wallet?

431
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,009
I never touched his wallet,
just his card.

432
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,919
I'd seen him use it at the quayside,
Monday evening.

433
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,279
Not interested in Monday.

434
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,979
This is a murder investigation,
Reece.

435
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,959
I wouldn't kill a man.

436
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,440
We're just supposed to
take your word for it, are we?

437
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,400
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

438
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,550
-Hiya.
-Hiya.

439
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,270
I need to talk to anyone who was
on duty on 4th January.

440
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,590
It's this way.

441
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,209
I've got no history of violence.

442
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,930
-I've never used a knife.
-All right, we'll see.

443
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,770
Go easy on him, he's not well.

444
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,450
Just a few questions about
your grandson Reece.

445
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,730
Where was he Tuesday night?

446
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,149
Here.

447
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,589
Every Tuesday and Friday,

448
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,629
he stays over when my
daughter's on nights.

449
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,619
Could he have nipped out at all
at any time?

450
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,599
No.

451
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,750
You seem very sure of that.

452
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,090
It's my chart,
he has to fill it in.

453
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,660
-Is this Reece's handwriting?
-Aye.

454
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,430
I can't be left in the night.

455
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,560
He was here.

456
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,549
He backed me up, yeah?

457
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,859
Told you.

458
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,199
You didn't tell him
about the card, did you?

459
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,220
You'll be getting a date for
your court appearance.

460
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,320
And, 'ey...
stay out of trouble.

461
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,219
You were all on duty on the 4th?

462
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,500
Do any of you remember
treating this man?

463
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,879
I remember him.

464
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,630
He was lush.

465
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,790
Lush?

466
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,179
What is it with these women?
Has she got the right man?

467
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,439
Definitely. Came in about
22:15, she reckons.

468
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,749
So what had happened to him?

469
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,789
This is the good bit.
He wouldn't say at first.

470
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,579
Painkillers kick in, more chatty,

471
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,299
told her he was in a fight

472
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,929
with four blokes
at the Bigg Market.

473
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,569
"Dispute over a woman" -
exact words.

474
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,069
We might have caught that on film.
Kenny, get it.

475
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,879
Hold on,
I have got other talents.

476
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,499
I managed to trace payments
to Warnock's account,

477
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,919
rental income he receives

478
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,930
for a property he
owns in South London.

479
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,800
Right.

480
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:35,949
So...he gets beaten up on
4th January.

481
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,899
Ten weeks later,
he's killed.

482
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,599
Is it because of this woman?

483
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,459
"Back off or you get stabbed"?

484
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,739
-Who is she?
-It might not be related a tall.

485
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,749
He could've got beat up
over the woman

486
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,790
and stabbed for resisting robbery.

487
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,920
What about the 6,000 and
the mobiles?

488
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,599
Come on, we've got to fill this up!

489
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,119
All we've got are the calls to
the corporate lawyer Lennox

490
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,049
and a few bank transactions.

491
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,759
I spoke to the Met again.

492
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,079
Warnock's retirement
was convenient for both sides.

493
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,409
Nothing too serious, he got narkey
after he was passed over.

494
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,869
Not a team player.
But funnily enough,

495
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,820
that's how he broke his leg
five years ago.

496
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,789
What?

497
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,670
It was a football tour to Romania,
a bad tackle.

498
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,319
He only got half his pension,
he was taking them to arbitration.

499
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,010
Well, that's good to know.

500
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,049
And what about the search team
at his flat?

501
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,470
No phones, no computer,
no meaningful personal effects.

502
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,510
Two days dead.

503
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,370
We're more in the dark than he is!

504
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,850
Hello.

505
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,889
Just a few more questions.

506
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,659
I'm afraid you know how it is,
things come up.

507
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,439
No, I don't know how it is,
actually.

508
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,490
It's the first time I've had
a brother murdered.

509
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,299
Sorry.

510
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,129
I'm not coping very well.

511
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,320
Well, it's a difficult time.

512
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,090
It have been at the end of worse.

513
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,440
It's an impressive place you have
here.

514
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,889
Yeah, it was a dairy once.

515
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,209
My dad tried beef and poultry

516
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,839
but you can't make a living out
of smallscale farming.

517
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,259
Well, you've certainly found a way
to make it work.

518
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,940
The tourists go mad for the riding
holidays.

519
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,640
I could do you a discount if you're
interested.

520
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,020
She's not much of an equestrian.

521
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,209
My stallion Captain Bob

522
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,969
was in a whisky
advert last year.

523
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,279
-Yeah?
-I think

524
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,920
the fame's turned his head.

525
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,780
Those...

526
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:55,309
injuries your brother
had just before your birthday.

527
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,349
We think he got into a scrap
with four fellas

528
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,510
in an argument over a woman.

529
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,929
I never asked about his romances.

530
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:07,550
-You disapproved?
-No, he just never gave any details.

531
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,460
Thank goodness.

532
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,740
Well, thanks.

533
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,909
Another thing.

534
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,110
There were no possessions to
speak of at his flat.

535
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,470
Did he keep any stuff here?

536
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,729
A few bits and pieces
from when he was younger.

537
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,680
-Can we have a look?
-Yeah.

538
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,669
That was the dining room
before my mam got ill.

539
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,630
How long was your mam ill?

540
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,369
For a year.

541
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,469
That must have been hard for you,

542
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,599
looking after her and taking
care of the stables.

543
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,439
I was happy to do it.

544
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,280
And John was down South
all that time?

545
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,090
He helped out when he could.
Here it is.

546
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,069
Player of the Year,
Morpeth Boys.

547
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,189
Always a dirty side, that.

548
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,700
They kicked lumps out of you.

549
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,939
"John is an able and
diligent student.

550
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,830
We wish him every success
in his exams."

551
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,490
Is that an engagement ring?

552
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,490
She was in those photos a lot, too.

553
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,150
Who's this lass with John?

554
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,689
Lisa.

555
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,320
Really pretty girl.

556
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,689
Is that his girlfriend, fiancee?

557
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,440
All through school,
talked of getting married.

558
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,610
She's the one that got away.

559
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,780
OK, ta.

560
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,679
What's Edwards got to say
for himself?

561
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,610
He's been to the brewery.
No one knew Warnock well.

562
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,519
He'd keep quiet, put in his shift,
take his cheque.

563
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,029
Quiet?
He's reckless!

564
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,269
Womanising, fights,
broken legs at football...

565
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:58,849
And I still can't picture
him sitting behind Plexiglass,

566
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,180
on minimum wage,
counting barrels of beer all day.

567
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,759
Anyone been over to that hotel
at the racecourse yet?

568
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,169
-Eva's alibi?
-And Harper's and Maggie's.

569
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,469
Three for the price of one.
Worth checking.

570
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,410
-You stopping here?
-Yeah.

571
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,079
-Risky.
-Risky?

572
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,150
It might get taken away for scrap.

573
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,490
Cheeky bugger!

574
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,439
She's got magic toenails.

575
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,749
That's nice.

576
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,149
Right, girls, do you want to go
down the other end?

577
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:50,299
Take him down the other end, Denise.
Play with Denise.

578
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,880
See you later, darling.

579
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,950
Little loves.

580
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,340
So you'd heard about John, then?

581
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,450
I didn't even know he was back
till I saw it on the news.

582
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,200
About nine months.

583
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,039
Didn't contact you?

584
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,920
He probably had plenty
more important things to do.

585
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,030
Well,
you were very close before.

586
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,890
I probably thought I was madly
in love with him once.

587
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,950
I can't believe he's dead.

588
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,380
His sister told me you were
the one that got away.

589
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:36,070
We were good together.
And, yeah, sometimes I think,
you know, what might have been.

590
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,030
Do you?

591
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,590
It's all bright and easy
when you're young, eh?

592
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,790
Why didn't you get married?

593
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,090
John wanted to get to London
and that, but I wasn't so brave.

594
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,410
When was the last time you saw him?

595
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,490
It's been years.

596
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,580
It was all or nothing for us.

597
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,790
Well, you can't stay friends after.

598
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,459
<i>Lisa, can you come
down here a minute?</i>

599
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,530
That's my husband, I...

600
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,750
<i>Lisa, will you get down here?</i>

601
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,050
I'd better see what he wants.

602
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,159
That lorry from Russell's,
did they just dump all that?

603
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,240
I told them to take it to the shed.

604
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,790
They're asking about John Warnock.

605
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,539
-Did you know him?
-Not really.

606
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,149
We were all at secondary
but Lisa knew him best.

607
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,490
I said I've not seen him in years.

608
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:52,129
Do you not keep in touch
with any of his old schoolmates?

609
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,799
I don't think he had many.

610
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,250
No offence, like,
but he was a copper.

611
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,749
Have you still got friends from
school?

612
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,189
-Aye, some.
-I expect you were popular, though, were you?

613
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,769
None of them are
bothered about my job.

614
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,190
I don't know about your mates.

615
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,160
Hello, what's she want?

616
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,179
All right, love?

617
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,190
I wish I could be more help.

618
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,519
What's her husband's alibi again?

619
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,770
Said they were both in watching
the telly Tuesday night.

620
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,180
Well, run some checks on him,
anyway.

621
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:52,029
We've got the Forensics report for
the traces found on the knife.

622
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,764
Two per cent eucalyptus
is used in lotions,

623
00:37:54,765 --> 00:37:57,699
lozenges, soap,
shampoos, vapour rubs,

624
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,739
dental hygiene products
and bio pesticides.

625
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,349
Five per cent can be used
in household cleaners,

626
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,610
as a parasite deterrent and...

627
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,769
Are you all right?

628
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,070
What are we doing here?

629
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,970
Carrie Kinsdale.

630
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,080
Number 127.

631
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,659
Oh, Janna's mate? The one
that Warnock tried to pick up.

632
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,849
-What are we doing here?
-Empty timeline.

633
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,720
Need to trace his movements.

634
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,550
Find out when he went to her
restaurant.

635
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,179
You're not coming?

636
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,750
No, I don't want to get in the
way of your charms.

637
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,309
<i>Joe Ashworth,
Northumberland and City Police.</i>

638
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,780
<i>Mind if I come in?</i>

639
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,570
Hello?

640
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,380
Edwards, what?

641
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,330
Right.

642
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,909
Edwards phoned.

643
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,339
There was an attempted takeover
at Finches back in October.

644
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,790
A big American hedge fund -
PZV?

645
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,289
Been buying up lots of small
breweries round Europe.

646
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,059
-But they didn't buy Finches.
-Harper turned them down.

647
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,839
He didn't want to be the man
who sold out

648
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,590
after 150 years in the same family.

649
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,529
That's interesting, but Warnock
didn't start working there till
November.

650
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:20,050
I know, but it's something to
chew on all the same.

651
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,560
You want to hear about Carrie
Kinsdale?

652
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,569
All right.

653
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,970
She served him at the restaurant
about five months ago.

654
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,520
He asked for her number
when the bill came.

655
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,009
Attractive, is she?

656
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,539
Aye, not too shabby,
but you know what he's like.

657
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,209
Quantity over quality.

658
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,490
Well, managed to resist him,
though, hm?

659
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,280
He was there with some woman,
some sort of business lunch.

660
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,420
Carrie thought he was tacky.

661
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,059
What's Warnock doing having
a business lunch?

662
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,769
The woman he was with
paid with some sort of company card.

663
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,939
Hastings & Purnell.

664
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,289
Not their regular clients.

665
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:19,259
Did she give a description
of this woman?

666
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,049
She was very vague -
blonde hair, early 30s,

667
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,960
wearing a suit. It could be anyone.

668
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,169
Here.

669
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,290
Lennox's business card.
Who does she work for?

670
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,790
Hastings & Purnell.

671
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:42,009
So what's she doing
having lunch with Warnock?

672
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:44,209
I mean, it was around the time
they were seeing each other.

673
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,170
That was night time only.

674
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,510
This is business.

675
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,079
Sorry.

676
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,389
Hello?

677
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,650
<i>There you are, love.</i>

678
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,480
Over here.

679
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,930
Right.

680
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,440
So Warnock was working for you
at Finches brewery?

681
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,099
I don't know what you mean.

682
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,180
This is thin ice.

683
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,870
Don't throw your career away.

684
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,179
I needed help with a client.

685
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,140
A very important client.

686
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,760
It was a stupid idea.

687
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,739
PZV were trying to buy the brewery.

688
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,899
Finches had rejected the first
offer.

689
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,389
It would've made the owners
a fortune

690
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:33,090
but you often get this issue
with a family firm.

691
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,069
Can I get you any drinks?

692
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,690
-That'd be nice.
-We're all right, thanks, love.

693
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,079
We really needed to secure
this deal.

694
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,569
There had to be
a way to apply

695
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,599
legitimate business pressure
to make Harper reconsider.

696
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,659
We were gearing up for
another bid and...

697
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,160
-You decided to play dirty.
-Warnock was suggested to me.

698
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,389
He'd done this sort of thing before.

699
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:55,519
He said he'd probe
for information

700
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,139
that could be
used as leverage.

701
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,080
Information?
What?

702
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:03,479
Credit arrangements, contract
details, that sort of thing.

703
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,390
-What did he find?
-Nothing.

704
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,430
The place is watertight.

705
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,379
Heartbreaking.

706
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,900
Harper runs a brewery and he
doesn't even drink.

707
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,039
The whole idea was a dud.

708
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,589
And Warnock was enjoying himself
too much.

709
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,309
He loved the cloak and dagger.

710
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:22,059
Midnight meetings, cash in hand,
anonymous phones.

711
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,169
So you knew about the phones?

712
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,939
He had a different one for
every job.

713
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,319
Payment was 50s only,
brown envelope under the table.

714
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,739
It was ridiculous.

715
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,869
Yeah, we found as much in his car.

716
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,659
Was that money from you?

717
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,329
Must be from another job.

718
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,290
I called him off months ago.

719
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,750
So why would he carry on
working at the brewery?

720
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,590
Maybe the daughter? He said she had
a bit of a soft spot for him.

721
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,540
Someone's got something to
celebrate.

722
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,599
I've never been anywhere
as posh as this!

723
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,239
I'm Scottish - where I come from,
damp's a colour.

724
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,959
Right, so we've got loads of people
from all over the place.

725
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,759
You madam, hello.
You look quite prim and proper,

726
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,040
looking at me, trying to figure out
what breed of dog I am.

727
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,320
We've got the man here in the
purple. Hello, sir.

728
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:29,739
Do the '70s know you're missing?
It's nice to see you.

729
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,209
We've got the really young lady on
the end and the very posh sister.

730
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,329
Who's this coming in now?
Hiya!

731
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:38,300
Look, everyone, the stripper's
arrived! Hello, sweetheart!

732
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,680
Come on,
get the baby oil out.

733
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,239
We've got the fella here...

734
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,570
He's very jealous of my hair.
I can see you, sir.

735
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:51,050
He's like, "I'm gonna shave that
and wear it round the garden."

736
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:52,750
-Hi.
-Hi.

737
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:56,640
It's nice to open your home up.

738
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,449
Well, Dad thought about postponing

739
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,830
but it's the Finches' tradition.

740
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,739
I heard there was
an attempted takeover recently.

741
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,619
There's always people interested.

742
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,339
Each one offers more money
than the last.

743
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,929
Never thought about accepting?

744
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:14,729
And let them water the beer
and kick out half the workforce?

745
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:17,979
There's people here whose families
have worked with us for generations.

746
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,590
That's very admirable.

747
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:26,449
Now, we just wanted to ask you
about you and John.

748
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:27,829
Hello. Where are you from,
my dear?

749
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:29,530
-Newcastle.
-Newcastle...

750
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,320
There was no me and John.

751
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,779
Well, we know he was a bit
of a ladies' man.

752
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,460
You're a pretty lass.

753
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,579
It seems unlikely he wouldn't
set his cap...

754
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,619
He did ask but...I wasn't
interested.

755
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,929
He was too old.

756
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,799
And to be honest with you,
he was dull as well.

757
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,529
On and on about work all the time.

758
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,340
I've had better chat-up encounters.

759
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:57,580
I love that. Half of you didn't know
whether to cheer or boo, right?

760
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,589
So he left you alone after that,
did he?

761
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,189
Yeah, he did...

762
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:06,019
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

763
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,280
Nothing, they're asking
about me and John.

764
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,479
You and John?

765
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,349
Don't worry about it.

766
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:15,350
It happens all the time. I turned
him down. It's not a big deal.

767
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:18,309
I'm always the last to know
anything.

768
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:20,120
I feel like I should apologise.

769
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,750
I'd have been upset if he hadn't.

770
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,120
Is it relevant to his murder?

771
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,889
It is,
if it turns out he was working

772
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,779
for one of your competitors.

773
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,080
Good night.

774
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,580
Sorry to interrupt your
celebrations.

775
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,450
Well, I've told you not to park
there, haven't I, love?

776
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,829
Ma'am, you're here.

777
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,729
What's this,
belated push for promotion?

778
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,239
-No, ma'am, there's...
-Kenny, talk to the brewer.

779
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,949
There's something about the fella
makes my teeth itch.

780
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:57,519
There's folk in there.
She's just arrived.

781
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,810
She won't budge till she's
spoken to you.

782
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,699
Ross wasn't always like this

783
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,900
and children need their father
but it's...

784
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,950
It's not safe any more.
He's...

785
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:28,299
If I tell you this,
we can't go back there.

786
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,739
You have to do your job.

787
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,080
Well, I'm very good at my job, love.

788
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,780
Sit down.

789
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,530
I messed up with John
when we were young.

790
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:48,010
We were so good, a proper couple
starting out, and then...

791
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,410
What happened?

792
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,190
Some fella at a party.

793
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,090
Ross?

794
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:59,510
John took off.
He didn't speak to me for years.

795
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,659
But he got in touch again recently?

796
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,390
He wanted to start over.

797
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,839
I didn't trust him at first,

798
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,809
thought he was trying
to get even with me

799
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:10,340
after what I'd done to him.

800
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,590
How often did you see him?

801
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,250
As often as we could.

802
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:22,780
It wasn't just about the physical,
you know. It was more than that.

803
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,060
Were you planning to run away
together?

804
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,399
He wanted me and the
girls to come to London.

805
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,039
He had this flat.

806
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,889
And he was going to sell it
for something bigger

807
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:37,750
and then we could all
start over but...

808
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,449
I mean,
he hadn't thought it through.

809
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:44,980
We have a whole life here.
Schools, friends and...

810
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,650
And why would he want me
after what I'd done to him?

811
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,979
And Ross found out about
you and John?

812
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,719
It was the other way round.
John...

813
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,149
John had found out
that Ross had been doing this.

814
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,040
He went to see him and...

815
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,980
And Ross and his lot
gave him such a kicking.

816
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,690
I wanted to tell you earlier. I
wanted to tell you everything but...

817
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:23,200
I think that...
that he killed John.

818
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,680
But he was at home with you,
wasn't he?

819
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,790
Not until the early hours.

820
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,980
God, he hated him.

821
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,160
He hated him so much.

822
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:04,330
Not looking very clever for you,
is it?

823
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,460
Beating Warnock weeks before
he's killed.

824
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,629
You must remember.
Four of you onto one man.

825
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,619
Very brave fight.

826
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,929
Who told you that?

827
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:17,180
Witnesses willing to testify.

828
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:20,009
He tried to steal my wife.

829
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:24,270
Who you love so much, you can't
keep your hands off her, big man.

830
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:42,399
You never told us before
about this dispute with Warnock.

831
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,550
Neither did you tell us that Warnock had
arrested you three times back in the day.

832
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,689
Where were you Tuesday night?

833
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:55,530
-At home.
-I'm afraid that won't wash any more.

834
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,110
Alibi's fallen through.

835
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,350
DC Lockhart.

836
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:05,299
I'm arresting you under suspicion
of the murder of John Warnock.

837
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,759
You're not obliged to say anything

838
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,550
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention when
questioned...

839
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:15,199
Where's Lisa? Where are my kids?

840
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,189
-They're safe, love.
-Where are they?!

841
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,800
-Hey, temper, temper.
-Mind your head.

842
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,289
What if you don't find any proof?

843
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:25,359
Look, you've done the right thing.

844
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,609
I know what people think.
Ross used to be all right.

845
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:29,819
It wasn't his fault
that I married him.

846
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,170
Well, it doesn't excuse
what he's been doing here.

847
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:37,760
I should have gone to London.

848
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,049
Hey, I wouldn't want to
uproot my family,

849
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:42,280
take us 300 miles down the road.

850
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,470
My daughter'd never forgive us
if I took her away from her mates.

851
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,510
I was frightened of Ross, though,
and what he'd do if we went.

852
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:58,090
You know what John was doing
at the brewery?

853
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,189
He was trying so hard
to earn us a fresh start.

854
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,809
You knew about his corporate jobs?

855
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,859
I just knew he was
working every hour

856
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,720
everywhere to get money.

857
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,909
But he had money, though, didn't he?

858
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,390
He had his flat, the pension, half
the farm.

859
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,780
The farm was left to Maggie.

860
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,739
-I thought he had half.
-No, he wanted half.

861
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,709
But Maggie had done all the work.
John was gutted but...

862
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,550
he'd no right to it.

863
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,490
2,000 boxes of cigarettes?

864
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:40,859
I take it you're not going to claim
personal consumption?

865
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,569
They were on a boat we salvaged.

866
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:45,709
Yeah, I'm sure they must wash up
at your yard all the time

867
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,739
and you just fish 'em out,

868
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,029
doing your civic duty.

869
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:52,279
Like when you attacked Warnock.

870
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,949
Look, I didn't tell you
about me and him

871
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:57,659
because if you knew we had history
you'd fit his murder on me.

872
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,129
Not me, pet.
Not without evidence.

873
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:02,220
Oh, so you're the one honest
copper, are you?

874
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:05,109
Your friend stuck loads of
false charges on me

875
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:06,979
when we were young
and no one stopped him.

876
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,919
Is that the story
you tell yourself?

877
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,729
For why you've never made anything
of your life, hm?

878
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,339
All John's fault?

879
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,199
But no,
he was gone for 12 years.

880
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,730
And you're still a criminal.

881
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,610
You just can't help yourself.

882
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,310
How do you feel about your wife
leaving you for another man?

883
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:28,390
-She didn't leave me.
-But she wanted to.

884
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:33,290
Until you knocked her back into
line.

885
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:39,950
Did you know from the start
you were second best?

886
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,799
Hm? Handsome John had gone off to
London

887
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,839
and she had to settle for you every
morning over the cornflakes.

888
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,789
But then John waltzed back

889
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:53,099
and it was as if
he'd never been away.

890
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,300
She was in love again.

891
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,000
You hadn't seen her like that
for years, had you?

892
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,279
But it wasn't for you.

893
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,890
Well, it's never been for you.

894
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,779
-I didn't do it.
-He was going to steal your wife and your bairns...

895
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,659
-Wouldn't have dared.
-..take them to London.

896
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,229
You've no alibi,
but you do have a motive.

897
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:17,209
So you tell me why I shouldn't
think you killed the man

898
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:19,290
who properly loved your missus.

899
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:23,490
OK.

900
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,320
I wasn't at home

901
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,399
but I wasn't anywhere
near the quayside either.

902
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,150
I was stealing lead.

903
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,419
Here we go,
another story.

904
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,589
What, you think I want to
tell you this?

905
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,950
St Nicholas's,
Thockrington.

906
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,960
Roofs, windows,
stripped the lot.

907
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,279
-Anyone with you?
-No.

908
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,129
So no one to corroborate?

909
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:48,430
That's where I was.

910
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,959
You've heard about the robbery
at the church

911
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,620
and now you're trying to
claim it as your own.

912
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,319
I've still got the lead.

913
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,780
-That doesn't prove anything.
-And I was seen at the church.

914
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,140
Who by?

915
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:06,040
I got a good look at him.

916
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:10,039
We reported the robbery too
but nobody came to talk to us.

917
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,409
Well, we're here now, love,

918
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:15,369
and we really appreciate
your cooperation.

919
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:17,789
Can you confirm the time
you saw the thief?

920
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:20,019
11:55 on the dot.

921
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,949
There's been a spate of these
robberies locally.

922
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:26,050
I've started checking the church
each night.

923
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,479
He wasn't even masked.

924
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,590
Utterly brazen.

925
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,690
Do you recognise this fella,
love?

926
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,660
<i>I'd recognise that ugly basket
anywhere.</i>

927
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,390
So I'll take that as a yes.

928
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,689
You understand that you've been charged
with a Section 11 theft from a church

929
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,409
and assault along with two others
on John Warnock

930
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:56,459
and assault on your wife?

931
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,149
This sheet gives you your time
and date of your hearing.

932
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:03,219
We've also made an emergency
non-molestation order without notice.

933
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,629
You're not to have any contact
with your wife or children.

934
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,639
I hope everything's in order here,
sir.

935
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,749
But just to be clear what we're
talking about,

936
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:14,480
if you even take breath near Lisa
or those kids, we will own you.

937
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,920
We're going to go paddling!

938
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,050
Well, we've charged him with theft.

939
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:40,219
And with assault on both yourself
and John.

940
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,010
And he's in custody now?

941
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,049
Well, he's been bailed,
love,

942
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,869
but he's not allowed to contact
you or the bairns.

943
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,479
He has to report to the station
every day.

944
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,659
But I accused him of murder.
He'll find us,

945
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:51,969
him or his mates.

946
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,580
We found you a safe house.

947
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,329
-How long can we stay there?
-As long as it takes.

948
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:59,049
Till you find somewhere
more permanent to settle.

949
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,240
It'll have to be away from
the North East.

950
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:04,779
Well, the main thing now is to keep
you safe.

951
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,050
No need for any rush decisions.

952
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,400
<i>Come on, Mummy.
We're going to build a sandcastle.</i>

953
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:16,449
<i>Did you do that?</i>

954
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:18,440
<i>Well done.
Brilliant.</i>

955
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,689
Lisa, you know that flat of John's
down south...

956
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:28,420
-I never went there.
-No, but you were going to, to start over.

957
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,520
Well, it turns out it's yours.

958
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,600
He transferred it into your name
six months ago.

959
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,220
What?
It's mine?

960
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:49,599
Really?
Did you hear that, Denise?

961
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,900
Yeah.

962
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:52,770
Yeah.

963
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,920
Well, I'll leave you to it, love.

964
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:03,490
Thank you.

965
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,120
Come on, then.

966
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:19,649
You know that waitress that
I interviewed, Carrie?

967
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:20,959
Yeah, what about her?

968
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,890
Yeah, well, it turns out that her
given name was Cara, Cara Kinsdale.

969
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,109
That was the name of your sister,
wasn't it?

970
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:29,760
-Was it?
-Is that her?

971
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,270
Well, she was very nice, anyway.

972
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:36,230
What's "nice"?

973
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,869
I just thought you
might like to know.

974
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:41,179
Right, everyone.

975
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:45,160
Ross claimed that Warnock
abused his position,

976
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:47,379
made false arrests.

977
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,909
So I want you to look into
his record again,

978
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:52,269
especially his behaviour
before moving to London.

979
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,109
Any lingering grudges.

980
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:55,810
What else have we got?

981
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,619
It's just something Lisa said.

982
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:59,629
She reckoned John never
got half the farm.

983
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,159
That Maggie got the lot.

984
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,779
Well, Maggie definitely told us
he got half.

985
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,640
Well, apparently John was gutted.

986
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,680
Was she lying to us
or has Lisa got it wrong?

987
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:13,269
I've run those checks on Harper and the
others. There's nothing on any of them.

988
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:15,319
And he keeps a very low profile.

989
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,259
Short of getting a warrant
to look at his phone,

990
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,659
we can't find any suspicious
link to Warnock.

991
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,419
What, the man who came
to spy on him,

992
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,049
sniffing around his only daughter?

993
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,299
But Eva did report a break-in
at the house

994
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,229
two weeks before Warnock was killed.

995
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,679
Never mentioned it.

996
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,969
Dialled 999.
Harper turned the officers back

997
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,410
when they arrived at the scene.

998
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,519
Why would he do that?

999
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,959
False alarm?

1000
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,490
Or you didn't want the police
trampling round your house.

1001
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:44,269
And the manager at the sport hotel,
plus several of the guests,

1002
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:46,589
confirm Harper, Maggie and Eva

1003
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,599
at the breeders'
function all night.

1004
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,569
And was the manager and the guests
with the three of them
for every single minute?

1005
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:54,589
I can upload these for you.

1006
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,169
Photographs from the dinner.

1007
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:59,169
I could knit them together
to track their movements.

1008
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,090
At first sight, it looks clean,
though.

1009
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,249
So why did Maggie lie to us,

1010
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,790
tell us John got half the farm?

1011
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:15,219
Right, she didn't tell us she got
the lot.

1012
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:18,779
And her fiance didn't tell us
that he'd been robbed.

1013
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:22,960
So what is it
they're trying to hide?

1014
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,900
Is that them?

1015
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,980
Looks like it.

1016
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:42,130
Not a care in the world.

1017
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:50,730
Morning.

1018
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,480
Right...

1019
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,169
It's no big mystery.

1020
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:03,950
Mam left the farm to me
and I gave John his share.

1021
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:06,749
So had he and your mam fallen out?

1022
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,139
She was cranky.

1023
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:10,740
It wouldn't have surprised me
if she'd left the lot to him.

1024
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,849
Or a dogs' home.

1025
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:14,719
So when did you split it?

1026
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,419
Quite recently, actually.

1027
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:18,349
Just a few weeks before he died.

1028
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:20,440
I can get you the paperwork
if you like.

1029
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,209
Must be worth a few quid.

1030
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:24,550
This place.

1031
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,170
And you just gave him half?

1032
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,119
Why?

1033
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,989
Can't anyone act decently these days
without attracting suspicion?

1034
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,599
It's all right, Sam.

1035
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,119
I could see John's side.

1036
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,439
I'd be upset if the shoe
was on the other foot.

1037
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,099
So he was upset?

1038
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,169
No.
No, we sorted it all out.

1039
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,759
Fair.
Half and half.

1040
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,150
You see?
An unreasonably decent woman.

1041
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,129
So if you could get us
that paperwork, love,

1042
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:56,579
so we can just be sure of our dates.

1043
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,430
-I won't be a minute.
-Yeah, thanks.

1044
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,249
Going to ask about the robbery?

1045
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:07,169
No. We need to get the daughter
on her own for that.

1046
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:09,139
She's the one who reported it.

1047
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,350
Harper sent them away.

1048
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,069
-Hello, love.
-Hiya.

1049
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:40,379
We won't keep you long.

1050
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:43,599
We just wanted to learn about
this burglary

1051
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,000
you reported a couple of weeks back.

1052
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,479
Why? You think it's
significant to John's death?

1053
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,589
No.
I don't think it's related.

1054
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:56,280
But if I don't ask,
it'll only nag away at us.

1055
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,200
Where'd the burglars get in?

1056
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:02,760
Um...forced the window
in my dad's study upstairs.

1057
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,029
Can we take a little peek?

1058
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:09,560
Yeah, sure.

1059
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:12,079
No alarms?

1060
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,260
No, the circuit on that window's
been broken for years.

1061
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,720
That's good to know,
if you were a thief.

1062
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,599
So you called the police at 23:16?

1063
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,430
But when the officers turned up
you sent them straight home.

1064
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,409
Well, I phoned my dad and Maggie
to tell them what happened.

1065
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:32,679
-You weren't together?
-No.

1066
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,680
Dad got here first.

1067
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:40,070
But, anyway,
by the time they came back

1068
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:42,659
we realised nothing had been taken.

1069
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,689
-Nothing at all?
-Hardly anything.

1070
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,359
That's why Dad sent the police away.

1071
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,999
Didn't want to waste their time.

1072
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,680
Considerate of him.

1073
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:52,399
In here, is it?

1074
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,700
Yeah.

1075
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,299
You still live at home?

1076
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,049
Yeah. Wouldn't be fair to leave
my dad on his own.

1077
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:06,669
So will you be moving out
when Maggie moves in?

1078
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:09,550
Yeah.
I think so, after the wedding.

1079
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,520
A new start for everyone.

1080
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:15,460
It's so lovely to see my dad happy.

1081
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,099
That's my mam and my dad.

1082
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,400
And me.

1083
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:23,359
-How did your mam...
-Eclampsia.

1084
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,810
At 30 weeks.

1085
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,579
I lost my baby brother too.

1086
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:30,929
I'm sorry.
That's none of our business.

1087
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:33,980
No, it's OK.
We hardly ever talk about it.

1088
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,319
That's just our way of dealing
with things.

1089
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,840
Well, that's as good a way as any.

1090
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,400
Is that a tattoo?

1091
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:49,690
Irish Army.

1092
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:52,869
I didn't know your dad
was a soldier.

1093
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:54,599
A long time ago.

1094
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,759
I think he left when he was 21.

1095
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,839
He doesn't have it now,
though, does he?

1096
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,499
Removed it years ago.

1097
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,270
I think it embarrassed him.

1098
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,420
So...

1099
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,829
John was working against us, then?

1100
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:11,619
That would seem to be the case.

1101
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:14,779
He was put in Finches specifically
to spy on your firm.

1102
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:18,050
Did you ever get a sense of that?

1103
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,010
Well, he didn't break in here
if that's what you're saying.

1104
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,140
You seem very sure.

1105
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,020
He was with me.

1106
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,349
You knew?

1107
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:43,929
You're a pretty lass.
Chances are, John would have noticed.

1108
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:45,439
What, and I'd be powerless
to resist?

1109
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,159
You'd have been plenty of company.

1110
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,609
How long were you together?

1111
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:50,770
We were never together.
We just...

1112
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:53,469
..met up every now and then.

1113
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:55,159
Whenever he clicked his fingers.

1114
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,189
Your dad would have been
happy with that.

1115
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:58,590
He didn't know.

1116
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,800
I'm not going to tell him, am I?

1117
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,940
I should have told you,
though, I'm sorry.

1118
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,710
Well,
better late than never.

1119
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:12,780
You knew he was seeing other women?

1120
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:15,180
How do you feel about that?

1121
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,830
It doesn't matter what I felt
any more.

1122
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:22,139
Tell us about the night
of the murder.

1123
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,990
-To think I cried for him.
-Tuesday night.

1124
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,050
I was at the hotel,
I've told you.

1125
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:32,980
You can ask anyone. I was there
with my dad and Maggie.

1126
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:37,480
I thought I could help him.

1127
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,910
You said hardly anything was
taken in the robbery.

1128
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:52,859
Just some cash from the kitchen
table, a couple of DVDs

1129
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:54,910
and my laundry basket,
for some reason.

1130
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,439
You mean like that one?

1131
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,999
That's the replacement.
It's only 30 quid.

1132
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,180
I can't understand
why someone would want it.

1133
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,739
Get Kenny to check out Harper's
background.

1134
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,980
Starting with his time in
the Irish Army.

1135
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:25,190
Meanwhile, let's go visit our
young pigeon fancier.

1136
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:37,469
You, Warnock, Harper.

1137
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,790
Full story, now.

1138
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,959
He came to me. He knew what I did.

1139
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,579
Wanted me to rob this house.

1140
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,400
500 easy, he said.

1141
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,140
What'd he want from the house?

1142
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,690
Well,
he was very choosy.

1143
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:58,939
Only wanted personal stuff.
Old stuff.

1144
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:00,240
Like what?

1145
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:04,719
Old passports, diaries.
Had to be over 20 years.

1146
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,179
And photos. That was the Holy Grail.

1147
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:10,369
-Looking into Harper's past.
-I didn't ask questions.

1148
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:11,679
Get what he wanted?

1149
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,219
There was nothing.
I was there for hours.

1150
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:15,439
-You got nothing?
-None of that personal stuff.

1151
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,799
There was a photo in the study went
back a bit.

1152
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,989
-The one with the mother and the baby?
-And a tattoo.

1153
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:22,480
I got a picture of it.

1154
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:24,890
Warnock seemed very
happy when he saw it.

1155
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,379
But then he said
he's not going to pay me

1156
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,119
because I didn't get him
enough stuff.

1157
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,039
Well, you swim with
the sharks, love.

1158
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,000
Yeah, well, that's why
I nicked his card.

1159
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:37,079
I didn't know he were gonna
get shanked.

1160
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,529
Yeah, well,
don't be down-hearted.

1161
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:41,409
You got a lovely
basket as a memento.

1162
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:44,150
And you'll be getting a visit
from my DC.

1163
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:48,599
Warnock stayed at the brewery
because he was onto Harper.

1164
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,919
What's he got against Harper?

1165
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,270
He's a detective,
like a dog with a bone.

1166
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,689
And once Lennox's
put him on the scent,

1167
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:56,019
he can't let go.

1168
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:58,369
But why go to these lengths,
getting someone

1169
01:08:58,370 --> 01:08:59,689
to break into the man's house?

1170
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:01,999
And what's he going to find
from old photos and passports?

1171
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,009
Well, something to profit from.

1172
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:06,529
Lisa told me he'd been working
every hour he could

1173
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:08,309
to get money together for them.

1174
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,409
But Ross had warned
him off by then.

1175
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:13,549
Would that stop you from thinking of
the love of your life?

1176
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,059
Making enough money so

1177
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,199
you can make a proper
go of it next time.

1178
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,459
OK. So what did he get on Harper?

1179
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:21,289
He got the Irish Army.

1180
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:23,659
The tattoo Harper had burnt
off his arm.

1181
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,979
-Well, so?
-We've all got our secrets, Joe.

1182
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:28,389
Even our teetotal brewer.
Kenny, what have you got?

1183
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:32,149
Ma'am, I started knitting together
those photos from the breeders' party.

1184
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:35,350
-There's just hundreds of all three of them.
-Well, focus on Harper.

1185
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,170
Right, no Sam Harper ever heard of
in the Irish Army.

1186
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:42,699
Eva might have been wrong about
the tattoo. She was young.

1187
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:45,269
No, she wasn't wrong.
He definitely served.

1188
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:48,509
-Well, make your mind up.
-The Second Battalion of the Eastern Command.

1189
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:50,849
I sent them a photo
of our man in the brewery

1190
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:52,550
and they mailed me back this.

1191
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,039
Based in Dublin.

1192
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,820
Spent two years in the Lebanon
as part of the peacekeeping force.

1193
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:01,160
His real name,
Kieran Murran.

1194
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:16,090
I just caught you.

1195
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,909
I wonder if we could have
a quick word.

1196
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:20,319
I'm already late for a meeting.

1197
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:24,990
I promise you we won't keep you a moment
longer than necessary, Mr. Murran.

1198
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:35,290
I've been Sam Harper for 25 years.

1199
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:39,610
The Murrans are a bad bunch.
I didn't want to be one of them.

1200
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,229
As simple as that.

1201
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:43,590
Say the name where I'm from

1202
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:47,859
and someone will buy you a drink
or smash a glass in your face.

1203
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:50,220
When did you leave the army,
Mr. Murran?

1204
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:52,919
I left the army in 1988.

1205
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,329
I didn't want to go home,
so

1206
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:56,709
got on a boat and became
Sam Harper on the way.

1207
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,069
Look, none of this was a
grand conspiracy.

1208
01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:00,979
None of it was thought through.

1209
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:02,390
We'll see.

1210
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:08,840
When I met Jenny and we had Eva,

1211
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:12,529
I was even more determined
that the Murrans wouldn't find us.

1212
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:14,209
So you've lied to Eva her
whole life.

1213
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:17,500
Jenny knew who I was.
We decided to protect our daughter.

1214
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:24,759
The women in my family, they drink,
fight, steal and kill themselves.

1215
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,610
Now,
if you know that's in your genes,

1216
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,769
it can be self-fulfilling.

1217
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:31,169
So was Warnock
blackmailing you over that?

1218
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:33,129
-No.
-You were the whole focus of his

1219
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:34,849
being in the weeks
before he died.

1220
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:36,689
I had nothing to do
with that piece of dirt.

1221
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:37,999
-Piece of dirt?
-Look,

1222
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,969
What I've discovered in the last few days,
I'm not surprised

1223
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:41,329
he died in the gutter.

1224
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,219
But I was at a party,
all night,

1225
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,599
so please, leave me alone.

1226
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,780
But he knew your big secret,
didn't he?

1227
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:55,730
Here's my phone.

1228
01:11:57,410 --> 01:12:00,829
My computer, bank account details,
diaries, keys.

1229
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:02,799
Go through the lot.
Waste as much time as you like.

1230
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,650
You will not find anything
between me and that man.

1231
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:10,780
Bag 'em up, DS Ashworth.

1232
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:16,819
We've nothing to charge him with...
yet.

1233
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:18,129
But if he's done it...

1234
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:21,460
We can't stop him running away
until we've got some evidence.

1235
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:32,890
<i>Ma'am, we've pieced together the
photos from the breeders' evening.</i>

1236
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:36,139
Warnock was killed at 11:33.

1237
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:38,759
Now, Harper goes missing from these
photographs

1238
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,630
between 11:22

1239
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:43,619
and 11:58.

1240
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,259
You wouldn't
expect him to be in

1241
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,790
every picture of the evening.

1242
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:48,689
He jumped in his car,

1243
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:51,109
drove to the quayside
and stabbed Warnock?

1244
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:53,189
All cos Warnock found out about
his false name?

1245
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:55,869
Or that Harper's whole life is a
lie.

1246
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:59,290
Look, it's four miles from the hotel
to the quayside. Is there enough time?

1247
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,929
Kenny, keep looking into
this Murran name.

1248
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:06,120
Joe, let's get over there.

1249
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:28,959
Yes, I'm afraid you'll find things
a little quiet today.

1250
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,279
The racing has been abandoned
due to the weather.

1251
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,889
Well, that's a pity.

1252
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:36,490
Here's me looking forward to a
little punt.

1253
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:39,570
Really?
On duty?

1254
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:44,510
You must be joking. On our wages?

1255
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:59,229
And was this balcony open during the
function?

1256
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:01,200
It's the main selling point.

1257
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:06,389
So any of the guests could have left
the party without being observed.

1258
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:10,029
Yes. And there are several other
ways in and out as well.

1259
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:12,760
This man was at the dinner.
Did you see him leave the hotel?

1260
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:18,099
We're interested in the time frame
from say 11:30 to midnight.

1261
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,739
That's Mr. Harper.
He's one of our regulars.

1262
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,810
Yeah, and where was he
during that time?

1263
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,450
We came out and had a smoke.

1264
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:45,029
Mr. Harper doesn't
like Eva to know.

1265
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:46,550
She thinks he's given up.

1266
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:49,850
This family and its secrets...

1267
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:54,859
So how long were you out here?

1268
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:56,830
10, 15 minutes.

1269
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:00,800
Harper didn't do it.
He didn't have time
to get to the quayside and back.

1270
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:25,980
And where was Maggie
during all this?

1271
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:46,249
And how long was she in here?

1272
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,789
It can't have been more than
an hour or so.

1273
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:51,550
She came up for a lie down.
She had a headache.

1274
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:03,989
If he didn't blackmail Harper,
who else is he going to try?

1275
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:06,549
The sister who suddenly coughed up
half the farm.

1276
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:08,050
Read the ingredients.

1277
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,280
Turps, codliver oil, eucalyptus.

1278
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:12,760
Where do you want to do this?

1279
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:19,679
-Hoof oil?
-Prevents sand cracks.

1280
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,780
We found traces of eucalyptus
on your knife.

1281
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:28,000
Some of the stones are hard to prise
out of the horses' shoes.

1282
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,490
I'm not sorry I killed him.

1283
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:36,490
I'm sorry I got caught.

1284
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:39,910
I'm sorry for Sam. He deserves
better. But John...

1285
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:43,979
Eva's just a young girl.
Hasn't even had a mother.

1286
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:46,299
He was using her like she was
just another...

1287
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,089
But this wasn't about Eva,
was it?

1288
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:50,549
We opened our arms,
made him part of the family,

1289
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,489
and that's what he gave us
in return?

1290
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:55,000
-Closely spied on Sam.
-Yeah.

1291
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:58,890
Griped about the farm from the
minute he came home as well.

1292
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:02,319
Four years it took my mother to die.

1293
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:06,099
And I was there
every long minute.

1294
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:09,219
He couldn't bear that things had
turned out well for me.

1295
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:12,100
He was meant to be the
success story.

1296
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:16,329
And then he found out about
Sam's change of name?

1297
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:18,509
-Did he threaten to go public?
-Yeah.

1298
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:20,329
Would have ruined his business.

1299
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:22,040
His competitors could have just...

1300
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,939
This has just come through
from Dublin.

1301
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:30,240
Thanks.

1302
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:36,720
What happens now?

1303
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,309
I think someone
cleaned John's flat out

1304
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:43,750
after the murder.

1305
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:46,119
I can't be certain

1306
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,959
but he must have
had a computer for his work.

1307
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,759
Or notes that would have

1308
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,249
told us what he'd been
up to in his last days.

1309
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,620
But there was nothing.

1310
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:58,570
Why would that be?

1311
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,910
I wanted him away.

1312
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:11,180
Out of our lives.

1313
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:19,230
He had this thrill for making havoc.

1314
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:27,259
Here we go.

1315
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:29,190
<i>One minute you're with the
people you love...</i>

1316
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:33,380
<i>And the next...</i>

1317
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:42,680
<i>Kept phoning.</i>

1318
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,810
<i>Pressurising me.</i>

1319
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,899
<i>Half wasn't enough.
He wanted me to give him the lot,</i>

1320
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,409
<i>sell the place straight away.</i>

1321
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:51,739
Please.

1322
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:53,040
<i>He was in a bar.</i>

1323
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:55,230
<i>All these girls laughing.</i>

1324
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,910
<i>It was just a game to him.
I was so angry.</i>

1325
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:02,460
He needed to be told.

1326
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,669
The work knife was in my pocket.

1327
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:38,830
I hadn't thought. It's always there.

1328
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:54,360
I didn't go to kill him.

1329
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:10,939
<i>I was so angry.</i>

1330
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,449
<i>He had a hook
in our mouths</i>

1331
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:14,150
<i>and he would never let us free.</i>

1332
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:21,790
And I don't know how
I came to do it.

1333
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:32,060
I took his phone and his wallet
to make it look like a mugger.

1334
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,589
You got the dirty end
of the stick for years.

1335
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:39,070
I can see that.

1336
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:42,680
Up there with only your mother
for company.

1337
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:46,390
But then you met Sam.

1338
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:49,430
And Eva.
Nice people.

1339
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:51,430
A family.

1340
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:55,510
But, you know,
John had found his family too.

1341
01:21:56,590 --> 01:22:00,279
He was hoping to settle down
with Lisa and the bairns.

1342
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,720
Did you know that?

1343
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:04,359
No.

1344
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:07,249
That's why he was extorting
money from you.

1345
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:09,549
Nasty way to go
about business

1346
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:13,790
but his actions
make sense.

1347
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:17,150
Whereas yours...

1348
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:21,520
I mean, why kill your brother
over a farm?

1349
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:24,339
I told you.

1350
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,049
-He was threatening -
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1351
01:22:26,050 --> 01:22:28,039
Sam's change of name.

1352
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,269
It would have ruined his firm,
his reputation.

1353
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:33,169
But you're strong.
Sam's wealthy.

1354
01:22:33,170 --> 01:22:36,619
Could have told him to take a hike,
do his worst.

1355
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:38,889
You and Sam had each other.

1356
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:40,820
You'd ride the storm.

1357
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:44,670
Unless...

1358
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,669
..John found
something on Sam

1359
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:51,750
that was worse than
a change of name.

1360
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:03,390
<i>Poor old Kieran Murran.</i>

1361
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:07,959
<i>No hope of doing anything good
in his life.</i>

1362
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,710
<i>Not with his sort of family.</i>

1363
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:13,680
<i>Especially his sort of father.</i>

1364
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:16,490
<i>Brute of a man by all accounts.</i>

1365
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:22,660
<i>Belted his son from dawn till dusk.</i>

1366
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:27,350
<i>So you know what Kieran did?</i>

1367
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:33,520
He ran away to England.

1368
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:35,720
Right.

1369
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,520
But not before...

1370
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:44,490
having one last
word with his old man.

1371
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:52,489
And here we are 30 years later
and he thinks he's got away with it.

1372
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:54,719
Cos lucky for him,

1373
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:57,159
the police had more
important things to do

1374
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:01,100
than pursue justice
for a brute like his father.

1375
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:08,939
So Kieran Murran
became the respected brewer

1376
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:10,990
we all know and love.

1377
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:14,399
But John had no great plan.

1378
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,940
No, he just happened to
sniff out the truth.

1379
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:20,660
And that was the secret...

1380
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:24,280
..you were ready to kill for.

1381
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:43,990
It has to end.

1382
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:53,899
It was self-defence.

1383
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:55,660
He would have killed me.

1384
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,029
I've no doubt of that.

1385
01:24:58,030 --> 01:24:59,650
I'm sure.

1386
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,880
Maggie ruined a life for what I did.

1387
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,399
Kieran Murran,
I'm arresting you

1388
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:16,329
for the murder of your father
Francis John Murran.

1389
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:17,869
You do not have to say anything

1390
01:25:17,870 --> 01:25:21,069
but it may harm your defence if you
fail to mention, when questioned,

1391
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:23,630
something you later rely on
in court.

1392
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,389
Hey, you want to come round to ours?

1393
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:51,409
Celine's made a stew.
You don't want to miss it.

1394
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:53,790
Next time, love.

1395
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:56,350
But thank Celine for me.

1396
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:54,390

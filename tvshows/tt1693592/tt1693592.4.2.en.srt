00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,679
Come on, then!

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,960
One, two, three!

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,400
Wait for me!

5
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,460
Alan.

6
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,059
Alan,
come here,

7
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,679
You're never gonna guess who's here.
Look, it's Jack.

8
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,200
-Who is it?
-Come and see, it's a surprise.

9
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,340
Welcome.
Welcome, everybody!

10
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,250
<i>It's great that so many of you...</i>

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
so many of you could...

12
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,879
Sit there.

13
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,120
Don't panic.
Let's undo your tie.

14
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,230
I'll get you some water.

15
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,079
One, two, three, four, five, six...

16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,380
Clear.

17
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,519
Manual CPR.

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,659
One, two, three, four, five, six...

19
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,960
Clear.

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,200
One, two, three, four, five, six...

24
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,569
Can you excuse me, love?
Can I get through?

25
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,870
Thanks, love.

26
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,980
Excuse me.

27
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,919
Lads, excuse me.
Can I get through, please?

28
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,220
Thank you.

29
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,679
I know, I know.
I'll have a word.

30
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,039
Pound a shot, this is what you get.

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,119
-Local or stag do?
-Town.

32
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,599
Card's linked to a flat up the
quayside.

33
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,900
David Kenworthy.

34
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,119
It's being done out.

35
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,679
The neighbours reckon he's been
living with the parents.

36
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,980
Darras Hall.

37
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,140
He's just a lad. You said he was
middle-aged.

38
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,879
"Managing director, Kenworthy
Estates."

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,330
Have you looked this up?

40
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,430
One for us, Marcus?

41
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,500
Yep.

42
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,180
Multiple bruising
from blunt trauma.

43
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,160
This one here.

44
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,759
Could've knocked him out
before he went over but...

45
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,460
Could have been conscious till the
cardiac arrest.

46
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,599
Look at this.
Very nice.

47
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,359
Didn't get that down the market.

48
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,340
Not a robbery then.

49
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,590
If this is a falling out over a
spilt pint...

50
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,720
It's a family firm.

51
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,990
Registered to
the Darras Hall address.

52
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,780
Right...

53
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,390
Well, get Uniform up there.
Give 'em the death warning.

54
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,780
Weekend on the lash down Whitley
Bay.

55
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,140
-Right. Who found the body, love?
-She's over there.

56
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,279
Excuse me.

57
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,839
Come on, lass.

58
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,970
A bit of a shock.
You'll be all right.

59
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,759
Just while it's still fresh in your
mind.

60
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,760
I tried...
with the blood but...

61
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,750
Well, you called for help.
That was enough.

62
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,929
I used his phone. My battery died.

63
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,780
-Right, have you still got it?
-I gave it to the ambulance man.

64
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,720
OK, fine, we'll chase it up.

65
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,099
-How did he seem?
-Fine.

66
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,230
Wished me luck finding a fare.

67
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,390
That was only, what,
15 minutes before...

68
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,180
-Could he speak at all?
-He made noises but...

69
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,180
I just held his hand.

70
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,050
Had you see him on the street?

71
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,180
Maybe.

72
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,260
I just... I don't know.
Maybe just standing there?

73
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,120
He was in pain, I think.

74
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,540
Ma'am, they've made
contact with the family.

75
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,959
Now, this is DC Lockhart.
He's going to be taking a statement.

76
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,859
He's one of our finest officers.

77
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,369
So anything you can remember,

78
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,439
even if it seems unimportant.

79
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,740
All right?

80
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,740
Will you...?

81
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,870
I don't know. Send my condolences?

82
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,540
<i>OK, if you'd just like to start?</i>

83
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,110
It's a retirement do.

84
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,700
Stepmother told Uniform
they were expecting him back for it.

85
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,879
Right.

86
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,780
So it's dad, and her.

87
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,260
Anyone else?

88
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,440
Brother, I think.

89
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, he's done well for himself -
dad.

90
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,260
Property.
Get in early, the only way is up.

91
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,320
Is there anyone else you'd like us
to inform?

92
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,560
<i>-Sorry.</i>
-It's just...

93
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,500
The media have this
phrase they use;

94
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,310
"named locally".

95
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,590
I'd rather we do that.

96
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,590
How do we even start?

97
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,369
Why him?

98
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,050
A robbery...
or what?

99
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,439
I don't know but we'll find out.

100
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,760
-They just left him there?
-Don't.

101
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,220
-OK?
-I should've gone to find him.

102
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,539
I knew something was wrong. I should
have...

103
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,990
Just don't, Tom, it won't get us
anywhere.

104
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,550
I can't take it in.

105
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,650
-When was the last time...?
-About three, headed out.

106
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,239
Said he'd be back at five to pay the
caterers.

107
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,540
But you don't know where he went?

108
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,470
Did he keep a diary,

109
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,099
you know,
to note down appointments?

110
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,659
-He's got a laptop.
-Well, we'll need to take that.

111
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,179
When can I see him?

112
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,579
We'll be doing the
postmortem first thing.

113
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,420
So, after that.

114
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,340
-I want to go there. Whitley.
-Of course.

115
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,280
I mean, why...
why Whitley?

116
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,919
Well, was there any connection?

117
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,260
Girlfriend? Friends? Work?

118
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,220
-Dad?
-I've no idea.

119
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,210
It doesn't make any sense.

120
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,840
This
whole thing was his idea.

121
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,530
Could your son be... a
bit... unreliable?

122
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,740
Not at all.

123
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,060
He was our rock, wasn't he?

124
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,180
He was.

125
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,980
Yeah.

126
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,540
He was.

127
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,690
Well, thanks for you cooperation.

128
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,380
-How'd they take it?
-Still in shock, I think.

129
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,599
Right. A list of all the guests.

130
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,419
Everyone who was here,
the time they came and left.

131
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
Anyone with a connection
to Whitley Bay...

132
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,039
and confirm the family
were here all night.

133
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,340
OK.

134
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,290
Here.

135
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,430
You're a lifesaver.

136
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,650
-If she asks, be vague.
-What?

137
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,180
We're banned from going
to anywhere "dodgy".

138
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,290
The kids love Whitley Bay.

139
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,850
-Hi, love.
-Hiya.

140
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,820
Excuse me, sir.

141
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,209
We're appealing for witnesses
for a murder enquiry,

142
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,520
if you can help?
Thank you.

143
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,600
Full force from behind.

144
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,129
-Surprise attack.
-No scuffle?

145
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,629
Force flips him over. Falls,
sustains wound at the front.

146
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,259
Not on his guard then?

147
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,569
Guy his age,

148
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,189
have to be sure you'll
knock him out or he might fight back.

149
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,229
-So could have been impulsive.
-Does it have to have been a bloke?

150
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,759
Not necessarily.

151
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,610
Tough chick with big arms.

152
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,589
Last meal:
chips with curry sauce.

153
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,039
Washed down with
a bottle of red.

154
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,079
Right. Pubs, takeaways, CCTV.

155
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,380
Right.

156
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,180
Right.

157
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,950
See you later.

158
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,940
Anything else?

159
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,449
-Carbon monoxide in the blood.
-Car exhaust?

160
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,710
More like spent time
with a heavy smoker.

161
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,319
-What was he hit with?
-Have to get back to you on that.

162
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,629
-Come on, Marcus.
-No.

163
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,129
I won't commit.

164
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,680
It could be anything.
Hockey stick, rifle butt...

165
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,820
Giant stick of rock.

166
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,199
Don't tell me - most of the
witnesses off their heads.

167
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,509
Pretty much.

168
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,319
But confirms the family
were there for the duration.

169
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,629
Good.

170
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,540
Kenny?
Mobile?

171
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,819
Paramedics are still looking.

172
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,199
For goodness' sake.

173
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,959
I can pull the call log off the server

174
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,679
but it'll mean a magistrate
getting out of bed on a Sunday.

175
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,639
That's a good a reason as any.

176
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,699
-Cameras?
-Most are trained on the street,

177
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,159
not the beach.
We're still looking.

178
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,560
OK, right.

179
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,279
David Kenworthy,
37 years of age.

180
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,589
Same business as dad,

181
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,699
made a packet off
those flats by the Sage.

182
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,719
So there's money sloshing about.

183
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,969
Currently living in the family home

184
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,039
while he's having a wet room installed.

185
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,799
Now that is an en-suite to the likes
of us.

186
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,389
Hen party saw him by the sea wall

187
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,399
and in the time it
took to buy a kebab,

188
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,639
someone had knocked him of the wall
and onto the beach.

189
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,669
Now why was he in Whitley Bay?

190
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,319
And what was more important
than his dad's big send-off?

191
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,210
His Facebook says single.

192
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,960
Well, that means nothing, does it,
Kenny?

193
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,909
Any previous contact?

194
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,379
No. Clean.

195
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,359
Bar a disqualification
for speeding.

196
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,819
Oh, that's why there were no...
no car keys.

197
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,729
So how'd he get to Whitley Bay?
Come on. Come on.

198
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,909
The PC on the scene was with the
hate crime unit

199
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,219
till last week.

200
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,539
He reckons there's been more than a couple of
attacks on the beach in the last few months.

201
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,790
-Any witness statements?
-No, no, just intelligence.

202
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,580
And it's mostly second-hand at that.

203
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,679
-So no victims coming forward?
-No.

204
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,240
Is there a cruising site nearby?

205
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,919
Why would I know?

206
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,950
Well, get on to the websites,
see if he had a profile.

207
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,719
-Ma'am.
-So he leaves the family home at short notice.

208
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,759
Expected back,
doesn't return.

209
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,959
So where did he go?
Who did he meet?

210
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,399
Friends, family, rivals, lovers. I
want the lot.

211
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,950
Joe, with me.

212
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,050
-Any pattern?
-Well, it's like you say, second-hand.

213
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,140
All use a weapon.

214
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,399
But most suggest a confrontation.

215
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,459
This was more of an unprovoked
attack?

216
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,840
Or targeted strike.

217
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,999
-Kenny.
<i>-Search history on the laptop.</i>

218
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,339
<i>It shows him looking up sold land
values in Whitley Bay.</i>

219
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,310
Spent about an hour on it,
the morning he died.

220
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,040
So not just here on a whim.

221
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,159
Alan's not been in the best of
health.

222
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,270
-The party was to celebrate, well...
-Handing over the baton to David.

223
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,770
He's not interested.

224
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,399
I'm not. I'm leaving. Well, was
leaving.

225
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,619
Were there any plans to develop, in
Whitley?

226
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,920
Not at all.

227
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,439
-You seem very sure.
-Good money after bad.

228
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,480
They saw eye to eye on that.

229
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,910
May I ask?

230
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,950
Was David gay?

231
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,119
I don't think so.
No, I mean...

232
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,600
Not at all.

233
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,149
Who's saying that?

234
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,799
-He's had girlfriends in the past.
-Anyone recently?

235
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,779
-Who's been saying this?
-No one. I'm just exploring.

236
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,989
This police work, is it?
Innuendo?

237
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,959
-She's just doing her job, love.
-She's making accusations.

238
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,770
If I hear this repeated back to me,
I'll...

239
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,590
I'm sorry.
I've let things get to us.

240
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,760
It's not him. It's the medication.
Mood swings.

241
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,730
But if he was gay,
might he have kept it hidden?

242
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,069
He was cagey about his love life,
I'll say that.

243
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,450
I got a sense there
might be someone but...

244
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,510
I think he would have
told us two at least.

245
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,560
Excuse me.

246
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,509
Did any of the guests
ask after your brother?

247
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,819
Most of them.

248
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,000
I said he was called to
an emergency at one of the properties.

249
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,599
Why not say you didn't know?

250
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,840
I didn't wanna worry anyone.

251
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,190
It was a business do.

252
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,879
You have to make it awkward,
don't you?

253
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,479
Sorry.
Bad habit.

254
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,839
Well, it makes sense. United front.
Keep up the reputation.

255
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,390
Yeah. Especially if you're being
sidelined.

256
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,869
Any luck?

257
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,630
Yep.
He was here last night.

258
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,479
Hello, love.

259
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,399
<i>-Yep, came in, bought the maxi.</i>
-Is that two portions or one?

260
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,859
It depends how hungry you are.

261
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,399
I call it a large to share
but some people, you know.

262
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,919
So, meeting someone?

263
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,079
Was anyone with him? Did he speak to
anyone?

264
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,990
There was an altercation.
No, that's wrong. More...

265
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,250
-"had words with".
-Who?

266
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,450
Him next door.
He'll be on your books.

267
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,539
Yeah.
Larry Crowe.

268
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,799
Found it. He was cautioned
last month for threatening behaviour.

269
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,609
<i>Numerous reports of trouble outside,
some of it him.</i>

270
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,919
Abusive to an officer,

271
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,790
<i>-no convictions.</i>
-Thanks, Kenny.

272
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,060
Want Uniform round the back?

273
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,190
Never hurts to put the wind up.

274
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,280
Right.
Every inch.

275
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,999
Oi!

276
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,059
-Can you get this opened up for us?
-No. You need a warrant.

277
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,839
Or we can arrest you,
if you prefer.

278
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,159
I see.
You're just stitching me up!

279
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,769
Aye, that's right.
Get the keys.

280
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,070
Hey!

281
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,350
I know what you're doing! I'm not
stupid.

282
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,260
Ma'am, we've found something.

283
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,650
What do you know!

284
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,790
It's been cleaned.

285
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,129
They've missed a bit.

286
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,879
<i>The 37-year-old
Newcastle resident</i>

287
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,259
<i>was found with substantial
injuries by revellers.</i>

288
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,149
<i>Emergency medical attention at the
scene failed to save the man,</i>

289
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,209
<i>who police have now named
as David Kenworthy.</i>

290
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,090
<i>His family have asked for privacy.</i>

291
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,589
-I wasn't there.
-Well, the bat's gone for analysis now.

292
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,689
What was the argument about?

293
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,509
-There wasn't an argument.
-Well, we heard different.

294
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,469
He was taking photos of this place.
I told him to leave off.

295
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,479
Why he was taking photos?

296
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,449
-Hello.
-"Curiosity", he says,

297
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,159
as if I'm a bloody idiot.

298
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,799
He was sizing us up.

299
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,629
You knew who he was then?

300
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,789
Been hanging around these last few
months.

301
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,319
Waiting to see what he
can pick up for nothing.

302
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,039
Cos that's how they operate,
the Kenworthys.

303
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,579
See a sign of weakness and they
swoop.

304
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,839
So where did you go after you didn't
have an argument?

305
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,180
Came back here,
mended the change machine.

306
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,040
Do we arrest him?

307
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,160
No. Wait for the lab report.

308
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,559
Have you found where
our victim was drinking?

309
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,359
He was drinking in
a bar down the road.

310
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,689
From 6:30,
a taxi dropped him off.

311
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,990
Thank you.

312
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,269
Drank alone till about nine o'clock.
Merlot.

313
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,740
-What, just sat there on his own?
-Apparently so.

314
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,440
When he should've
been glad-handing.

315
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,150
Why?

316
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,190
What's that?

317
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,929
A cleaner found it.

318
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,830
The receipt matches with
the victim's card details.

319
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,740
Books?

320
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,260
Dog Wit.

321
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,309
Food Britannia.

322
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,619
Whitley Bay.

323
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,080
He definitely had an interest in
this place.

324
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,650
What was he up to?

325
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,829
I mean,
on the property side.

326
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,699
What was he not telling them?

327
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,739
Planning for when he was in charge.

328
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,690
What, behind his father's back?

329
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,619
-Shep.
-I'm at the Kenworthy Offices.

330
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,529
From what they're saying here,
money in the bank,

331
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,989
creditors paid on time.

332
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,449
-What, it was all above board?
-Good employers, I think.

333
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,759
Though most seem to reckon they
played hardball in negotiations.

334
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,820
Well,
look out for any business rivalries,

335
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,459
disgruntled sellers.

336
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,299
Maybe they made
themselves unpopular.

337
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,600
<i>Will do.</i>

338
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,240
He spends weeks planning a party.

339
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,440
No explanation, comes here instead.

340
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,179
It's out of character of him not to
phone, so...

341
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,659
He didn't want them to know what he
was up to.

342
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,620
Or... he was making a point of not
going to the party.

343
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,010
Maybe that's all he was doing in
Whitley. Not being there.

344
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,790
Otherwise he'd have phoned,
with an excuse.

345
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,260
Maybe. Or maybe he'd had a drink
and lost track of time.

346
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,760
Well, he'd have got the taxi,
wouldn't he?

347
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,620
I mean, is it odd?
Maybe I'm reading in...?

348
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,700
Or maybe he just thought the taxi
was a waste of money.

349
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,409
How is your Jess? Back at school OK?

350
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,710
Yeah.

351
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,820
Celine thinks all the girls in
her year are a bad influence.

352
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,650
She's got us moving
catchment areas.

353
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,350
Couldn't lend us 30
grand, could you?

354
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,779
Kenny, tell me this is an update
from the lab.

355
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,429
<i>I've just run the address of the
parents at Darras Hall.</i>

356
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,980
There's a fatality in 1977.
Burglar fell off the roof.

357
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,299
<i>A burglar named Patrick Crowe.</i>

358
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,119
Well, it's not that common a name,
surely?

359
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,859
Is there a coroner's report?

360
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,300
Looking now.

361
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,680
Patrick?

362
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,740
Bring him in.

363
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:35,689
1977. Coroner records a verdict of
accidental death

364
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:40,490
in the case of a 15-year-old lad
named Patrick Crowe.

365
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,710
Your son Paddy, is in a bungled
robbery at Kenworthy's home.

366
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,299
Now why didn't you mention that?

367
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,820
Because you're all in his pocket.

368
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,339
Do I look like I'm taking
backhanders, love?

369
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,199
You did jack-all when it happened,
you'll do jack-all now.

370
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,169
-I cannot stand it.
-So what should we have done?

371
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,979
-Well, get him for murder.
-Who?

372
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,949
Who d'you think?
Alan Kenworthy!

373
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,620
Hang on, hang on.

374
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,700
Take us through it -
this burglary.

375
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,159
He never burgled anyone.
That's the point.

376
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,289
So what was he doing on the roof?

377
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,239
That's what the
Kenworthys hired him for!

378
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,799
He was a builder's apprentice.

379
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,779
That was his job,
being on roofs.

380
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,419
I see. He was up there doing
a bit of practising, was he?

381
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,559
-At the boss's place?
-You see? You've decided.

382
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,860
I've decided nothing.

383
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:43,770
You give me your version,
then I'll decide.

384
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,989
There was a knock on the door.

385
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,530
Two coppers smirking.

386
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,630
"Your son's dead.

387
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,509
"But it was his own fault,
cos he's a thief,

388
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,099
"so never mind."

389
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,829
Yeah, well, things weren't always
handled right.

390
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,179
Kenworthy says that he's caught him
breaking in

391
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,930
and he ran on some flat roof,
slipped, fell.

392
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,959
-Accidental.
-So why don't you believe that?

393
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,189
Because he knew he'd
been given a good chance,

394
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,949
so he wasn't gonna muck it up.

395
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,699
So what was he doing up there?

396
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,139
I don't know. I don't know.
But it's not that.

397
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,239
-Did you ask?
-Aye. Course.

398
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,419
I kicked off big time because I
wanted your lot to investigate.

399
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,809
Nobody listened.
They just said I was barmy.

400
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:33,730
And that drove me barmy.
Drove the wife barmy.

401
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,220
Where's she now?

402
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,900
She died about ten years ago.

403
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,919
We weren't together, you know,
it just ruined everything.

404
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,109
I was angry, you know?

405
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,709
You changed the name of the
business.

406
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,919
Well, I couldn't stand any
reminders.

407
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,750
I just wanted to move on.

408
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,340
But why lie?

409
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,940
Why say he was a thief if it was an
accident?

410
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,060
Why...
just...

411
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,779
Why break our hearts twice?

412
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,949
Or maybe you just couldn't stomach
the truth.

413
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,379
No. He's not what he makes out, you
know, Kenworthy.

414
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,839
No. But nobody sees it.
He's got you all fooled.

415
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,959
So, what, you thought you'd get your
own back some 30-odd years later?

416
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,770
No, cos I wouldn't do that to
another person. Not even him.

417
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,939
Where's the lab got with the blood
stain?

418
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,749
Why hurry?
It's only a murder.

419
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,239
He's certainly got motive.

420
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,319
Yeah,
he saw his chance and took it.

421
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,690
David sizing up the property.
The final insult? Loses it?

422
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,059
-Brace yourself.
-What?

423
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,509
Paramedics reckon they've
not got the mobile.

424
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,979
Brilliant. How many times the
tide gone out since then?

425
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,419
Well,
the provider are gonna send us...

426
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,250
Store fingerprints on the server,
do they?

427
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,580
Think it through.

428
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,489
Right, we'll keep him until
forensics get back.

429
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,069
Who's got the statements from the
guests?

430
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,550
Celine, Joe.

431
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,359
We're gonna look at a place. A
house.

432
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,859
-Where?
-Tynemouth.

433
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,420
-Very nice.
-Just to get a feel for the area.

434
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,219
And I can come back in
if you need us.

435
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,059
No. Lab might take hours.

436
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,899
We'll start in the morning.
Go on.

437
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,959
It's a wreck.
We can hardly afford it, I know.

438
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,099
I know. but the schools there...

439
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,980
You might bag yourself a bargain.

440
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,909
Put your own stamp on it,
make the place your own.

441
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,750
Well, you were right. It is a
bloodstain on the bat.

442
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,939
Well,
it's like I've done this before.

443
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,640
Wait for it.
Lab have got a match.

444
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,219
<i>Well, of course,
there's a blood stain.</i>

445
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,419
I had a run-in with
a bloke last month.

446
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,629
Came at me with a
broken pint pot.

447
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:51,279
I protected myself.
Don't you check your own records?

448
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,150
-I know you've been cautioned for violence.
-Self-defence.

449
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,620
There's nothing on me, no matter how
hard you try.

450
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,739
The blood stain is a match to our
victim.

451
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,029
Have you checked out that change
machine yet?

452
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,539
-I'll do it now.
-Good.

453
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,459
Covered everything to the water's
edge?

454
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,179
See if the lifeguards saw anything
on Saturday.

455
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,190
-Go right down to the end.
-OK, ma'am.

456
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,369
What time did Crowe
leave the chippie?

457
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,579
Blokey reckons around 9:50.

458
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,590
-And the girl found the body...
-The call to 999 at 10:01.

459
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,209
That's 11 minutes.

460
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,539
I've got six witnesses
saying he was fixing

461
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,349
the change machine
when they heard the sirens.

462
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:02,010
I'm not taking the word
of a bunch of gamblers.

463
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,139
Ma'am, he's logged a call to the
manufacturers.

464
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,269
They've recorded it at 9:57 from
their office phone.

465
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,779
There's a transcript of the call.

466
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,139
He could have done it, if he was
quick.

467
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,619
But he didn't have the bat in the
chippie's, did he?

468
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,470
He'd have had to double back in,
what, six minutes?

469
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,789
It's not enough time.

470
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,919
If he'd done his best Usain Bolt.

471
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,490
He's nearly 70.

472
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,119
He leaves the chippie, right?

473
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,929
Then he legs it next door,
gets the bat,

474
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,589
and then legs it all
the way over here,

475
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,989
down to the beach - wallop!
- and then goes all the way back,

476
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:40,020
and strolls in as cool as a...
Nah.

477
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,360
That's not gonna work.

478
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,400
So, if he's got an alibi...?

479
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,610
How did the victim's
blood get on that bat?

480
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,519
Who else has access to your office?

481
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,019
No one.

482
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,949
There's only one key
and I keep it on me.

483
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,659
Could someone have broken in?

484
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,539
No, cos I was in there phoning the
change machine people.

485
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,680
-Did you give the key to someone?
-No.

486
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,199
Who are you protecting?

487
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm offering you a lifeline here.
Take it.

488
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,379
You've got an alibi, fine.

489
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,789
So who took the bat to get the
victim's blood on it?

490
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,290
I'm not saying it was someone else
when it wasn't.

491
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,529
-In that case...
-Here comes the stitch-up.

492
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,999
-..I'm going to release you.
-Eh?

493
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,729
For now. But you remain a person of
interest.

494
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,179
Thank you.

495
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,489
Oh, listen.

496
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,300
I know Kenworthy,

497
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,449
he controls people.

498
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,759
Like who?

499
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,229
Who, other than you, has
got a problem with him?

500
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,530
Everyone!

501
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,349
Well, even his own kids
were scared of him.

502
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,379
You could see it in their little faces.

503
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,989
You knew him as a child?

504
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,099
-The deceased?
-Not him. No.

505
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,219
But the older boy and the sister.

506
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,419
They used to come down here
on the sly to play the slots.

507
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,019
But they were messed up,
the pair of them.

508
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,339
Frightened!

509
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,669
That's quite an allegation, you got
evidence to back it up?

510
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,419
What, my word not good enough for
you?

511
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,000
I'd quit while you're ahead, pet.

512
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,269
Joe?

513
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,509
I'm getting surveillance to check
out the arcade.

514
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,179
Find out who might've
got into the building.

515
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,289
Good.
Did they mention a sister,

516
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,029
the Kenworthy family?

517
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,419
-A sister? No, I don't think so.
-Get on to it, Kenny.

518
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,110
-Is there a name?
-Something Kenworthy.

519
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,980
But she might have married.
So... something something.

520
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,340
I think they deserve an update,
don't you?

521
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,139
<i>Some of the locals</i>

522
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,249
<i>seem to think he had plans</i>
to develop in Whitley.

523
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,739
Well, he didn't, because we don't.

524
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,910
Look, I know it's hard.

525
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:07,929
But is there any chance David could have
been doing things you weren't aware of?

526
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:11,599
What, like a drag act in Darlington?

527
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,379
-Alan!
-Well, the woman goes from bad to worse.

528
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,679
It just doesn't seem like David.

529
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,589
He was what you see
is what you get.

530
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,569
He wouldn't sneak about.

531
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,439
What if something had changed?

532
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,359
Why was he drinking
alone for three hours?

533
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,349
I just can't answer that.

534
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,020
He must've been confused or...
I don't know.

535
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,140
It doesn't make any sense to us.

536
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,180
One person who came to
our attention was...

537
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,290
a fella called Larry Crowe.

538
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,989
-Aye?
-That name ring a bell?

539
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,299
No.

540
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,300
Says his son worked for you before
he died.

541
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,619
-An apprentice?
-Fell off a roof.

542
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,549
Is he looking for compo?
Only we've had more than one.

543
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,870
No, fell off the roof of this house.

544
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,720
What did he say?

545
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,510
That I killed his son?

546
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,379
-The man's a lunatic.
-He's said something before, has he?

547
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,989
At the time, yes.

548
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:13,549
He'd gone quiet for
the last few years.

549
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,940
Only you said you didn't have any
connection with Whitley Bay.

550
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,219
A fella with a grudge?

551
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,739
I thought he'd died.

552
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:28,440
Still, seems like the sort of thing
we might have needed to know.

553
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,510
Can you just admit it?
Your memory's not what it was.

554
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,739
It's why they've
give us medication.

555
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,389
That's why I've been
moved off my own business.

556
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,489
He's supposed to avoid stress.

557
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,270
We attract rumours.

558
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,309
She's a gold digger, I'm a murderer.

559
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,200
David was up to God knows what.

560
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,850
It's jealousy, we can deal with it.

561
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,579
But this is just too much.

562
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,069
He's not eaten for two days, so can
we, please...?

563
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,679
Yeah. Yeah, OK.
Just one...

564
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,420
last question about family.

565
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,010
You have a daughter...

566
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,080
Lorna.
What about her?

567
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:19,220
Well, is Lorna still alive? Only you
haven't mentioned her.

568
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,880
We're out of touch.

569
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,850
So do you know how I could contact
her?

570
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,759
We fell out.
I've... I've not seen her...

571
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,050
Oh, since God knows when.

572
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,010
Would Thomas know where she is?

573
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,349
-No.
-Well, I'd still like to talk to him.

574
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,090
He's not here.

575
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,739
I don't know where he is.

576
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,810
He's with the priest.

577
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,650
Making the arrangements.

578
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,299
<i>It could have slipped his mind.</i>

579
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,030
Do I buy the doddery old fella act?

580
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,959
A bloke that age
can be as wily

581
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,410
as anyone, believe me.

582
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,270
How long has Karen been around?

583
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,390
First wife passed in 1990.

584
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,259
And they married in 2002.

585
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,029
Not the new addition then.

586
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,150
Not the wicked
stepmother swooping in.

587
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,329
Still, it's a bit of a gap.

588
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:42,079
At least ten years coping alone.

589
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,729
One teenager, and a couple of
20-somethings.

590
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,940
That's Easy Street,
parenting-wise.

591
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,780
Finger's crossed.

592
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,489
-Shep?
<i>-Bloke in the bookshop -</i>

593
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,039
<i>apparently the victim said
the books were a gift.</i>

594
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,859
A gift?
Hold on.

595
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,820
Not for him, the books.

596
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,729
Well, for the dad?
To give them at the party?

597
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,149
Well, that's a bit metrosexual
for him, isn't it?

598
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,979
-Cookery?
-Well, I don't know.

599
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,099
<i>And I found a list</i> of the properties
they manage,

600
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,209
and the flats above <i>the bookshop
were also part of that portfolio.</i>

601
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,219
<i>Well,
maybe his trip was work-related.</i>

602
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,659
Do we know who the tenants are?

603
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,400
They are a...

604
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,280
family of six <i>rehoused
from the Kingfisher.</i>

605
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:29,189
<i>-Any contact with them?</i>
-Uniform knocked, but no answer.

606
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,309
Council tenants, though?

607
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,509
Yep. In fact, the company
makes most of their money

608
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,219
letting to people on benefits.

609
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,520
Well, they don't parade that, do
they?

610
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,879
Here's me thinking it's
all luxury apartments

611
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,949
and grand designs.
<i>Shep,</i>

612
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:45,650
Shep, get Uniform to knock again. -
Will do.

613
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,219
Ma'am. Yeah. Computer forensics.

614
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,309
He had an appointment in his
calendar on the Saturday afternoon.

615
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,019
An estate agent.

616
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,729
<i>Yeah, she says she drove him to see
a new build out by the coast.</i>

617
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,090
He didn't tell us that either,
did he?

618
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,290
Concealing what he was up to on
dad's big day.

619
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,750
Or they didn't tell us.

620
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,620
Remember when this was all fields?

621
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,340
Nicky?

622
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,889
You're not Becky and Dan, are
you?

623
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,190
No, love.

624
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,979
Can we come in?

625
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,280
Yeah.

626
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,449
Very nice.
Did he make you an offer?

627
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:06,720
No. They tend to go for
properties where they can add value.

628
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,019
So why did he come and see it then?

629
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,359
Well, I think it's a case of
check out the competition.

630
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,459
The rental market's quite buoyant.

631
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,709
I suppose families can't afford a
deposit, can they?

632
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,740
Exactly.

633
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,679
Have you done a lot of work for the
Kenworthys?

634
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,529
Oh, well, I've managed a couple of
the rentals in the past.

635
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,939
-How was that?
-Easy.

636
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,540
David's good at picking
people that are no trouble -

637
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,600
was good.

638
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,229
It's my manager that's had the most
dealings with them.

639
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,200
So why'd he see you for this place?

640
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,370
Were you friendly?

641
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,229
We weren't boyfriend or girlfriend
or anything official.

642
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,400
But... we did...

643
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,979
-Yeah, we had a connection.
-For how long?

644
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,430
On and off for the last six months.

645
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,779
Why keep it quiet?

646
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,239
They were big clients and, like I
say, it was never official.

647
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,050
And did you have "a connection" with
him here...

648
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,480
-on Saturday?
-No.

649
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,040
Why not?

650
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,149
If I'm honest, we had a row.

651
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,619
About...?

652
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,829
I told him I wanted more. You know,
a proper relationship.

653
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,549
He wasn't keen?

654
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,659
He said life was
"too complicated" or some such.

655
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,039
-Too much "stuff" going on.
-Stuff?

656
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,340
Exactly.

657
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,780
I just wanted to know where I stood.

658
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,990
I really liked him...

659
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,659
So, you had a row and then what?

660
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,939
He walked out. Slammed the door and
I never saw him again.

661
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,319
Were you invited to the party?

662
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,350
Yeah.
But through work, not as a couple.

663
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,840
I thought I'd make up to him there.

664
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,600
When he never showed up, what did
you do?

665
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,230
Drank the bar dry and puked in the
cab on the way home.

666
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,399
I'll get Shep to cross-check the
statements from the guests.

667
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,749
She's a canny lass. Why's he
keeping her at arm's length?

668
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:22,009
"Stuff".
Still, it rules out cruising.

669
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,950
Bloody doesn't.

670
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,390
Becky and Dan.

671
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,759
It's all downhill from here, guys.

672
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,949
What do you want to live here for
anyway?

673
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:36,259
There's no character, it's
completely isolated.

674
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,820
Wait a minute.

675
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,659
David doesn't drive.
So if she dumped him here...

676
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,600
How'd he get to Mileside?

677
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,389
I have been warned about data
protection.

678
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,380
Aye, just do it.
It'll be fine.

679
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,179
Is this this fella who was killed?

680
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,970
-Did you speak to him?
-No.

681
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,389
-There you go.
-Did you see the driver who picked him up?

682
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,999
Yes. Nice-looking girl.

683
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,419
Girl?
What age?

684
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,760
Maybe early 50s?

685
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,319
-Thanks, love.
-Ford Focus. Registration number LV55 ZTE.

686
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,780
Just as quick as you can.

687
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,840
-OK, as soon as you can.
-Sir.

688
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,419
Kenny, I want to place Karen at
Monkseaton.

689
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,129
-The stepmother?
-Right.

690
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,439
Speed cameras,

691
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,149
any time she used her
debit card.

692
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,849
Anything that will tell us she lied

693
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:53,529
about her whereabouts
on Saturday afternoon.

694
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,890
OK, will do.

695
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,679
Ma'am?

696
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,949
Ma'am, there's a lady there who
wants to lay some flowers.

697
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,250
Is that OK?

698
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,529
I'm DCI Vera Stanhope. I'm heading
the investigation.

699
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,889
Are you friends of the deceased?

700
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,629
Not exactly, no.

701
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,129
I'm Lorna.
I'm his sister.

702
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,210
I think things are just hitting
home.

703
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,569
Did you know David?

704
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:14,830
No. No.
I didn't know any of them.

705
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:18,920
Things ran...
pretty deep.

706
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,039
Would he have suffered?

707
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,050
No, love. No. He'd have been
unconscious throughout.

708
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,290
And he wasn't alone when he...?

709
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,790
I think a lot of people tried very
hard to save him.

710
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,790
Do you know when the funeral is?

711
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,940
Have you not been in touch with the
family?

712
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:54,730
-How'd you find out?
-Radio.

713
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,969
We do try to contact the relatives.
I'm sorry.

714
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:01,470
I don't think it's really sunk in.

715
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,950
I didn't see him for so long
and then...

716
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:10,149
-Had you been in touch?
-Yeah.

717
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:13,840
I'd seen him most weeks for the last
few months.

718
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,680
I saw him on Saturday.
Before...

719
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:21,320
We sort of kept it quiet.
I thought you might not know.

720
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:26,250
Did you drive him from Monkseaton to
Mileside?

721
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:32,969
He sent me a message on Facebook,
about four months ago.

722
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:35,849
And it became a once-a-week thing?

723
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:39,330
Yeah. We'd come for chips in
Whitley.

724
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:42,510
Take me through Saturday.

725
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:47,220
He called out of the blue.

726
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:51,249
Said he'd fallen out with a girl
and was stranded.

727
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,569
But why call you, not call a taxi?

728
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,190
Well, that's what I thought.

729
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,059
Ulterior motive.

730
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,649
Tried to persuade
me to go to Dad's for some party.

731
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:06,059
Sprang it on me.
I declined, obviously.

732
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:10,379
You know, he kept the fact he was seeing
you quiet from the rest of the family.

733
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,200
-Do you know that?
-Yeah. I asked him to.

734
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:17,149
He was disappointed,
but it would've all kicked off.

735
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,950
I didn't want Dad making him choose.

736
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,640
How do you mean?

737
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:25,090
Well, you're either on
Dad's side or you're not.

738
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:28,469
-I'm not!
-Why's that?

739
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,490
Because we don't get on.

740
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:32,730
Then what?

741
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:35,070
I went home,

742
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,380
made the boys' tea.

743
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,410
Went to work.

744
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:42,660
Never saw him again.

745
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,930
Did you part on bad terms, love?

746
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:51,930
No. No,
I think he understood.

747
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:57,229
Well, I'm going to need a contact
for your work, love.

748
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:58,990
-I'm sorry.
-Of course.

749
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,780
What was he doing at Mileside?

750
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:11,320
Donkey work,
to do with the property he said.

751
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:15,159
Thomas had left him in the lurch,
I think.

752
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,529
What, they'd had a disagreement?

753
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,750
Oh, no, I don't think so.

754
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,900
Thanks, love.

755
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:25,649
So how did he seem?
You know, in himself?

756
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,209
I got the impression he had a lot on
his shoulders.

757
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:30,729
But happy, mostly.

758
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:34,459
And how was his relationship with
your dad and his wife?

759
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,250
And, of course, your brother.

760
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,679
He wouldn't hear a word said against
them.

761
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,139
I mean,
if I thought there was a feud,

762
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,939
I'd be the first to say, but...

763
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,630
No,
he just tried to convince me that...

764
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,169
Dad had mellowed.

765
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,290
That it was all Happy Families.

766
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:58,850
Just give me a minute.

767
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,609
Well, here's my direct line.

768
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:08,289
And we'll try and keep you
in the loop as far as we can.

769
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:10,190
Much appreciated.

770
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,820
Or she'll be at the computer 24/7.

771
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:18,959
You know, she collapsed when she
heard the news.

772
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,459
Came back, heard it on the radio.
She was just curled up on the floor.

773
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,289
How do you mean came back?

774
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,720
She was with Val.

775
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:32,070
They went out
after work for a drink.

776
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,079
Ma'am. Lorna Underwood.

777
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,379
Works at a rescue
centre for stray dogs.

778
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,179
Yeah, ring her colleague Val

779
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,530
and confirm that they worked
late then went for a drink.

780
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:01,309
-What?
-Problem at the lab.

781
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:02,619
Blood stain.

782
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,799
They're now reckoning there's no
match for David on there.

783
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,719
For pity's sake.

784
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,590
It's lucky we didn't charge him.

785
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:13,299
-What? Contaminated samples?
-They think so.

786
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,449
And whose cock-up's that?
Ours or theirs?

787
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:20,290
They're looking into it.
They've sent you a diagram.

788
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:23,410
And they're very sorry.

789
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:28,119
-No joy with the mobile,
-Not you an' all.

790
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,179
Provider said that the data was
wiped at handset level.

791
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,819
It'll take 24 hours to get it off
the backup server.

792
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,129
Wiped?
How?

793
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:38,559
Well, somebody could've found it on
a beach. Cleaned it up to sell it.

794
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,289
Right, check eBay. Check the girl.
Check everyone.

795
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:45,610
Check every drunk, every stag do,
the lot.

796
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:49,940
We've missed someone. Don't sit
down. Come on!

797
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,050
She said Thomas left David in the lurch

798
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:00,320
so what was he supposed
to be doing in Mileside?

799
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:19,759
We're looking for Thomas Kenworthy?

800
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,019
He's not here.

801
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,729
Well, where is he?

802
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,169
He went to speak to a builder's
merchant, I think.

803
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,129
-Which one?
-I don't know.

804
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,369
Well, let's go through them one by
one, shall we?

805
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:34,559
When was he last here?

806
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,860
I've haven't seen him since before
dinner time.

807
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:42,020
Where does he normally go?

808
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:45,009
-Come on, come on.
-There's a pub.

809
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,629
He goes there.

810
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:49,080
When he doesn't want us to
know he's been drinking.

811
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,490
Name?

812
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:53,889
He left about an hour ago.

813
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,809
I tried to take his keys off him,
like, but he wasn't having it.

814
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:59,359
-Does he drink here a lot?
-Aye. Necks it back.

815
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,209
Play a bit of darts sometimes.
But... not social.

816
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,380
Where's your dartboard?

817
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,370
Got a room out the back.

818
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,039
-Can I take a look?
-Well...

819
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,700
I'm not Health and Safety.

820
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,410
This takes me back.

821
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:21,259
Aye, well, keeps us in business.

822
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,269
When was he last in, before today?

823
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:26,730
Friday before the rush.
That's carbon monoxide.

824
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,409
Anyone with him?

825
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:31,989
Aye. His brother...

826
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:33,869
the fella who died?

827
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:36,989
-He come in to find him.
-You sure it was him?

828
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:40,869
Aye. Thomas was off his face,
he went for him!

829
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:44,090
-There was a fight?
-I had to step in.

830
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,989
I bloody stink now.

831
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,599
Thomas Kenworthy.
Six foot,

832
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,849
dark hair.
Driving a Qashqai, we understand.

833
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:57,159
-Ma'am.
-Yeah, Kenny,

834
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,919
get on to plate recognition.

835
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,419
Run the brother's vehicle.
Seems to have gone AWOL.

836
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,139
<i>Right. We've just had word from
family liaison.</i>

837
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,969
-The dad's been hospitalised.
<u>-When?</u>

838
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:10,019
Well,
he was found collapsed at his home.

839
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,409
He's on his way to the
cardiac ward at the District.

840
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:15,400
-Is his son with him?
<i>-Couldn't say. Sorry.</i>

841
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,779
We're here for Alan Kenworthy.

842
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:39,109
OK.
Lift to level minus one.

843
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:41,419
-Follow the signs.
-Yeah, signs to what, love?

844
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,720
Mortuary.

845
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:03,169
Major cardiac event.
Died in the ambulance.

846
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:04,679
Just like that?

847
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,459
It's not surprising,
man of his age.

848
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,879
-Anyone with him?
-Apart from the trauma team?

849
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,139
His wife, I think.
But she's been taken home.

850
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,739
Did anything about it strike you as
unusual? If it had, I'd have told you.

851
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,809
-I'd like a postmortem.
-It'll be a wait.

852
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:19,669
We'll do our own.
Get on to Marcus

853
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:21,779
tell him to collect the
body and tell him it's urgent.

854
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,089
Thanks, love.

855
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:24,599
We've got plate recognition.

856
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,419
Thomas' car found up at Mileside.

857
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,549
Mileside?
The bookshop?

858
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:30,759
Retracing David's footsteps?

859
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,700
Well, let's get after him.
Break the news.

860
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,370
If he doesn't know already.

861
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:49,810
Hungry?

862
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:53,370
Get them to take this in.

863
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,060
Done a runner.

864
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:00,710
-All ports warning?
-Aye!

865
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,090
These are addressed here.

866
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,350
Why did he collect the junk mail?

867
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:52,449
He's not here.
There's no one here.

868
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,959
I think that's the point.

869
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,529
Come on.

870
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,039
I told the other officer.

871
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,870
We went for last orders
then I dropped her back.

872
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:08,569
Nothing else?

873
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:11,580
I wouldn't lie for her, not to you
lot anyway.

874
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,579
-I'll get it.
-How much is this for a haircut?

875
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,199
Fine.
I'll dye my own.

876
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,470
Michael, stop teasing your
sister.

877
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:21,619
Hey, tell him. How much is a lady's
cut and colour?

878
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:24,289
Hey, you're asking the wrong person,
pet.

879
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:26,920
-It's what it costs.
-I'll do it. It'll be good practice.

880
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:29,499
You are not becoming a hairdresser.

881
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,519
Karen Kenworthy spoke to Thomas.

882
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,019
She called into the office.
Shep's on her way out there.

883
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,129
-We'll go via the office.
-Hey, have you eaten?

884
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,430
I'll be all right!

885
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:43,889
-He said he was on a bender.
-OK. What time?

886
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:48,690
Late, I was asleep. I told him about
Alan.

887
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,420
He just hung up.

888
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,459
Rise and shine!
What have we got?

889
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:00,049
Shep's list of tenants.
First five all dead.

890
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,369
Well...
What do we make of that?

891
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:04,289
Serial killer?

892
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:06,979
Well, that's the
clear-up rate sorted.

893
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,560
It's a scam.
Fictitious tenants.

894
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:12,629
Buy any old dump,
then tell the housing lot

895
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,519
you're putting up people
they've lost track of,

896
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,199
or evicted or what have you.

897
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,859
Slips through the net.
Did David know?

898
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,929
Well, maybe he found out.

899
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:23,219
Maybe that's why he didn't
turn up at the party.

900
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,920
Knew it was a sham.

901
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:26,929
Have those texts come though yet?

902
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:29,819
Yeah,
the most recent to time of death

903
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:32,759
was between the deceased's phone

904
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:38,140
and a pay-as-you-go that was bought in
the Northeast sometime in the last month.

905
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:41,129
Narrows it down.

906
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:44,089
How long before we get a name for
the recipient?

907
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:45,790
A different provider.

908
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,250
The magistrate is looking into it.

909
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:51,729
Find out if that pay-as-you-go was
paid for on a card.

910
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:54,080
-Might speed things up.
-Yeah, it might not.

911
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:56,299
Ee'll just give up now then,
shall we?

912
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,689
Listen to this.

913
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,509
Sender, 1900 hours.

914
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:04,289
"You OK?
Still love you."

915
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:07,849
Now David replies... but not until
2110.

916
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:09,810
"Yeah, I'm in Whitley."

917
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,080
Sender:
"I'll come and meet you."

918
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:15,759
"You OK?"

919
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,769
I mean, that implies he was upset
beforehand, doesn't it?

920
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,079
And with who?

921
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,980
-A girl?
-The brother?

922
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:25,250
Sounds a bit mushy for bloke to
bloke, doesn't it?

923
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,439
-What about the sister?
-Hang on.

924
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,829
Sender:
"Where are you?"

925
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:32,209
David:
"Rendezvous!"

926
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:33,700
Exclamation mark.

927
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,979
Exclamation mark.
Why the surprise?

928
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,280
Thought it was obvious?

929
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,619
Where I'd obviously be?
Where I always am?

930
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,199
What? So, a regular meet, so the
sister.

931
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,900
Aye, but the sister's alibi checks
out.

932
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:48,059
Shep's spoke to her colleague.
She was up there until about ten.

933
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:50,769
So not obvious.
So why?

934
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:53,399
-Marcus called.
-Have a nice chat, did we?

935
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,929
Very funny, Kenny.
He left a message.

936
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:56,859
He'd like a call back, please.

937
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,160
Right.

938
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:01,010
Well, let's get over there.

939
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:04,859
Get the forensic accountants on to
their lettings transactions, will you?

940
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:09,530
Words to strike fear into the
heart of any killer.

941
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:13,549
What were you thinking?
Pillow on the face?

942
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,879
That could trigger a heart attack,
couldn't it?

943
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,579
But then...
so could a thick build-up

944
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,189
of plaque in the left ventricle.

945
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:21,009
Any bruising?
Sign of a struggle?

946
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:23,089
Sorry. History of
cardiac events,

947
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:25,769
long-time smoker.
High cholesterol.

948
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:28,099
Liked to drink,
enlarged liver.

949
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,559
-He's lucky he made it this far.
-Nothing?

950
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,210
No compression of the teeth,
no signs on the fingers.

951
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:36,890
Been at it since first light
but... nothing.

952
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:41,640
I'd convinced myself
he'd been done in.

953
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,409
Am I the one who's getting
doddery?

954
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:50,010
Well, there's no right answer to
that one, is there?

955
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,550
Look, maybe I'm just reading in.

956
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,329
I just feel he's casting a shadow.

957
00:59:57,330 --> 01:00:00,770
You know? I mean, if could we
work out how dad fits into...

958
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,620
Has anyone informed the daughter?

959
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:27,789
Nice area.
Celine would like it here.

960
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:31,370
Not done bad for herself has
she, Lorna?

961
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:35,569
Oh, look at that. What does her
husband do again?

962
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,880
GP. Must do a bit of Botox on the
side, eh?

963
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,070
I'll go.

964
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,370
Hello.

965
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:58,729
I'm sorry, love.

966
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,290
Can we come in?

967
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:04,689
The boys are at home. Can I just
dispatch them first?

968
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:06,289
Yeah.

969
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,990
I'll just be a minute.

970
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:10,829
Come on, lads. Let's get you
down to the cricket club.

971
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,180
Grab your kits.

972
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:19,770
-Would you like tea or coffee?
-No, no, thanks.

973
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:44,440
You all right?
You're not gonna pass out this time?

974
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:49,420
I'm fine.
It's just the shock.

975
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:54,280
We were just concerned you didn't
hear via the media again.

976
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:57,129
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

977
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:02,310
-I should contact them, shouldn't I?
-Well, that's up to you, pet.

978
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:08,029
Could you give me a number for
Thomas or whatshername, Karen?

979
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:11,130
Well...
Thomas seems to have gone missing.

980
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:15,250
Well, David said he'd started
drinking, after his divorce.

981
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:18,569
That he'd just go off on benders.

982
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:21,869
-Do you know where?
-No, no, just that he did.

983
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:24,039
This would've hit him very hard.

984
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,890
He worshipped Dad.

985
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,109
I've said umpteen times,

986
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:36,329
"You've moved on,
make contact."

987
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:37,729
But she's always shut it down.

988
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:40,359
There's counselling if she wanted to
speak to someone, or if you...

989
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,750
-No, thanks.
-Do you know why she lost contact?

990
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,680
Something happened
after their mother died.

991
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:48,610
That's all I know.

992
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:58,870
Never let the sun set.
Never.

993
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:05,419
You get used to estrangement.
Comes a point it gets easier.

994
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,210
But from your own dad.

995
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:11,410
Ah, well, he still cast a shadow,
like I said.

996
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,770
Don't worry, won't happen to you.

997
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:19,129
-Kenny?
-No, it's me, the good-looking one.

998
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:21,469
<i>Plate recognition
on the Qashqai?</i>

999
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:25,669
We've got Thomas's car driving into
Darras Hall at 10:45,

1000
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:26,970
<i>Saturday.</i>

1001
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,569
He left the party?

1002
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:31,559
It looks like it.
I'm sorry.

1003
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:35,509
How come we didn't see him leaving
the party?

1004
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:36,819
I don't know.

1005
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,409
The guests might've been
diverted by the dad's collapse.

1006
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:41,560
Or he made sure they didn't notice?

1007
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:43,640
Right.

1008
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:47,399
Place the Qashqai on
the road to Whitley.

1009
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,249
Anytime earlier
and we've nailed him.

1010
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:53,190
-Already on it.
-Well, <i>better late than never.</i>

1011
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,869
Qashqai keys have just been found.
The coast road.

1012
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:59,620
Right, they've found the keys
to the Qashqai. The coast road.

1013
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:09,420
-Do you want a search team down there?
-I think we're gonna have to.

1014
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:16,730
Sends David a text reassuring him.

1015
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:20,109
David reveals his whereabouts.

1016
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:23,499
So Thomas goes to Whitley, things
get heated.

1017
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,619
You know,
"You're on the fiddle."

1018
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,239
There was no fight
on the prom, was it?

1019
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,049
He didn't give him a chance.

1020
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:32,470
Premeditated. Get in quick before
losing your bottle.

1021
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:34,989
You'd have to be pretty set on doing
it.

1022
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:37,110
Well,
dad doesn't rate him does he?

1023
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:42,790
Could have been festering for years.
Jealousies, resentments building up.

1024
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:46,970
Dad thinks he's a loser,
or knows he's bent.

1025
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:50,039
Cuts him out the picture work-wise.

1026
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,769
Or dad knows what's best for him.

1027
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:53,570
Knows he can't cope.

1028
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:59,860
Come on!
Where are you?

1029
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:04,170
Crowe!
Open up!

1030
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:08,249
-Go away.
-I wanna talk to you!

1031
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:10,450
Leave me alone.

1032
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:12,939
Oi!

1033
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:16,499
Crowe, open the door, I wanna talk
to you!

1034
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,990
Crowe, I want a word with you.
Come on!

1035
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:23,859
Just clear off or I'll come out
there and see to you!

1036
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:44,410
Mind your head.

1037
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,670
What do you want with Crowe?

1038
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,469
Karen said his name came up.

1039
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:16,239
-What was the feud about?
-Just know that Dad hated him.

1040
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,250
We've ruled Crowe out. He has an
alibi.

1041
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:22,509
Who from?
Some crook down Whitley?

1042
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:25,749
That's rich, seeing as you're
all on the fiddle.

1043
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:29,380
Kenworthy Estates claiming housing
on that little lot.

1044
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:34,429
Only half the people you're putting
up have passed away.

1045
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:39,159
Or made up. Derelicts you're naming
as family homes.

1046
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,309
Nice little margin on that.

1047
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:43,969
Getting your own back, was it?

1048
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:45,739
Dad didn't think
you were up to it,

1049
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:48,089
so thought you'd
show him otherwise?

1050
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:49,589
-No.
-No?

1051
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:54,399
David found out about your dodgy dealings,
dragged you out of the pub Friday night.

1052
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,239
Big fall out.

1053
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,839
He won't go to the party
because he knows it's a sham.

1054
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:03,449
And you feel humiliated, don't you?
Seek him out.

1055
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:06,629
-But I was at the party, wasn't I?
-Were you?

1056
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:10,509
Well, your car wasn't seen in Darras
Hall until - when was it?

1057
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:13,939
-Quarter to 11.
-Quarter to 11. So where had you been?

1058
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:15,450
Whitley Bay?

1059
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,270
-No.
-Have words. Wallop.

1060
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:26,479
I wasn't on the fiddle.
David was.

1061
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,680
Oh, that's nice.
Blame the dead fella.

1062
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:34,690
Now what reason would he have to
cheat on his family?

1063
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,840
The whole thing is
about to go belly-up.

1064
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:40,710
Desperate.
Dad lost his touch.

1065
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,459
He kept buying
any old rubbish that came on the market.

1066
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,310
Stuff we couldn't have let without
major renovation.

1067
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,699
David wouldn't
confront him about it.

1068
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:52,549
He said he had a plan
to recoup the losses.

1069
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:55,159
I didn't realise it was dodgy until
last week.

1070
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,629
Still kept quiet about it, though,
didn't you?

1071
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:59,990
I was trying to protect my dad.

1072
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,549
David was the apple of his eye.

1073
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:05,390
That make you jealous?

1074
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:07,650
What?

1075
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,800
Not at all.

1076
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:15,510
Not...
at all.

1077
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:20,080
Where did you go?

1078
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:24,250
-Drove around for a bit.
-In circles?

1079
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:26,880
Till Karen called.

1080
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:29,990
I don't believe you, pet.

1081
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:33,750
Don't believe you.

1082
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:40,610
OK...

1083
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,789
I'm lying.

1084
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:48,200
You're right. I just wanted to get
my own back.

1085
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,860
OK?
Happy?

1086
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:54,319
I just wanted to hurt him

1087
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,720
or at least show him
I wasn't pathetic.

1088
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,549
Whilst someone knocked his head in,

1089
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:03,590
I was trying to bang a girl who was
in love with him.

1090
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:06,580
Just to prove myself.

1091
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:13,290
And how long was he at yours?

1092
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:18,500
We didn't actually... I was too
drunk.

1093
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:25,319
OK, we did, but... I'm not like that.

1094
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,380
I...
I just...

1095
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:30,209
I was so hurt.
I wanted to hurt David back.

1096
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:32,310
It was just a stupid mistake.

1097
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:34,869
Why did you lie to the police?

1098
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,629
Look, I didn't tell you because
I didn't want people to think

1099
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:39,830
I didn't love him,
because I did.

1100
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,940
I really did.

1101
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:49,029
Great.
A couple of the statements

1102
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:50,919
mention a girl sick
all over the loos

1103
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,879
and escorted out
around nine o'clock.

1104
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,859
Seems to match her description.

1105
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:58,630
I can check speed cameras around
hers to confirm but...

1106
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:01,770
Do I let him go or...?

1107
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,390
Go home.
I can manage.

1108
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:08,290
You sure?

1109
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,680
What about the criminal damage?

1110
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:36,460
-What about the damage?
-No, I wanna drop it.

1111
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:39,889
Well,
for what it's worth,

1112
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:42,890
wasn't us told him you
were under suspicion.

1113
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:46,169
You know I thought,
when Kenworthy dies,

1114
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:49,429
I'll feel this great weight lifted,
but...

1115
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:53,690
Aye, well, it can't be easy
something like that.

1116
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:56,870
Yeah, well, they moved on, didn't
they?

1117
01:10:57,270 --> 01:11:01,330
Had another kid,
played happy families.

1118
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:04,590
I lost everything.

1119
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:52,109
-Kenny.
-Ma'am?

1120
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:55,650
How old was Lorna in 1977?

1121
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:02,950
14.
Oh, hang on.

1122
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:05,710
Birthday last week.
That means 15.

1123
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:12,490
David bought the books and these
were a gift, weren't they?

1124
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:19,399
We're giving them the best.
More storage isn't gonna change that.

1125
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,430
It's not about storage.
It's about the...

1126
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:23,970
Peer group.

1127
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:28,639
-When did you become so snobby?
-It's not snobby to want the best.

1128
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,950
We went to a rough
school and we survived.

1129
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:40,070
Yeah?

1130
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:43,350
Yeah, OK. OK.
I'm on my way.

1131
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:50,190
Look, she wants me to go in. I'm
sorry.

1132
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:55,149
Listen, I know you just want the
best.

1133
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:57,159
But we're doing all right

1134
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,460
and we're not divorced yet, are we?

1135
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:01,929
I suppose not.

1136
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:03,230
Come here.

1137
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:10,190
This is what they need.
Parents who stick together.

1138
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:12,770
Go on,
go.

1139
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:19,129
Did you change your plans at the
last minute? Arrange to meet him?

1140
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:22,439
No, I was with Valerie at the
centre. I thought you'd checked this.

1141
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,149
Aye,
and we're checking again.

1142
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,350
Well, good, because I didn't.

1143
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,109
Who else might he have bought

1144
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:31,210
a last-minute birthday present for?

1145
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:33,589
I have no idea.

1146
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:37,290
Look, I don't know what you're
getting at, but I wouldn't hurt David.

1147
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:39,640
I loved him.
He was...

1148
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:46,900
He wasn't your brother, was he,
love?

1149
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:51,230
He was your son.

1150
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:59,080
His DNA.

1151
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:01,429
The markers...

1152
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:05,540
show a strong overlap
with a man named Larry Crowe.

1153
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:08,960
Which means David's real father...

1154
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:12,910
is Larry Crowe's son Patrick.

1155
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:19,810
Paddy.

1156
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:23,980
Why don't you take me through it?

1157
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:29,150
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I need a word.

1158
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:41,819
Yeah, mobile phone.
Bought by credit card

1159
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,399
in the name of Lorna
Underwood in Allenburn.

1160
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:48,670
Now the first was sent from her house,
and the last one's from Whitley.

1161
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:52,520
Has she got a motive?

1162
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:57,059
Not losing a family twice.

1163
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:29,530
He came to work for Dad in the May.

1164
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:33,949
I wasn't supposed to talk to him or
any of the labourers, really.

1165
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,520
Bad influences from Whitley?

1166
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:40,779
Wanted us to grow up better than
him, he said.

1167
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,530
Attitude back then.

1168
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:45,959
I do think Paddy loved me, though.

1169
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:49,299
I know that sounds daft
about a 15-year-old boy,

1170
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,100
but I do think he did.

1171
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:55,750
-But you got pregnant?
-Yeah.

1172
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:57,910
Then what?

1173
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:02,069
Dad wanted me to get rid.

1174
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:05,050
I wasn't having any of it.
I screamed the place down.

1175
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:07,570
So he made an offer.

1176
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:11,949
David could grow up one of the family
if we never spoke about it.

1177
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:14,500
Protect my reputation.

1178
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:17,050
Protect his,
more like.

1179
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:21,919
Me and Mam went to Stoke for six
months.

1180
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,749
And when she came
back she told people

1181
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,489
David was a happy accident.

1182
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:28,900
That was the deal.
Put up and shut up.

1183
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:32,290
That must have been hard.

1184
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,350
At least he was there though,
wasn't he?

1185
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,420
At least I had him.

1186
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:40,710
What happened when your mam died?

1187
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:45,689
David was so bereaved.

1188
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:49,369
I just... I wanted him to know he
still had a mother.

1189
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:51,699
Dad came down on that
like a ton of bricks.

1190
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:54,180
I had to leave. I couldn't bear it.

1191
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,069
Does this have to come out?

1192
01:16:57,070 --> 01:17:00,770
I mean, how do I break
something like this to my kids?

1193
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:04,939
I gave up everything so David could
have a normal life.

1194
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:07,550
Do you see? I could never harm him.
Never.

1195
01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:28,450
When did you tell him?

1196
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:31,880
In the car to Mileside.

1197
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:36,099
He kept going on and on
about me going to the party

1198
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,449
and how we could
all reconcile.

1199
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:40,009
How Dad had softened,

1200
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:42,879
and Karen had
been like a mum to him.

1201
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,950
That tipped me over, I'm afraid.

1202
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,890
How did he react?

1203
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:52,470
Very angry.
Upset with Dad.

1204
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:57,059
Felt everything was a sham. Said he
couldn't face them.

1205
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:59,779
And he threatened to put it all out
in the open.

1206
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,390
Sort of, yeah.

1207
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:04,550
Must have been terrifying.

1208
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:06,390
Yeah.

1209
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:12,579
Do you own a pay-as-you-go phone,

1210
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:16,080
number ending 458?

1211
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:19,449
-Yes, but...
-Text deleted.

1212
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:23,099
But the provider keeps them on the
server for 48 hours,

1213
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:27,750
and here you are on
your way to meet him.

1214
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:46,809
-Did you send those texts?
-Not that one or these.

1215
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:50,389
It's your phone. You use this one
just to contact David?

1216
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:52,489
I didn't send this saying I was
coming to Whitley.

1217
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:54,449
-How did it get there?
-I don't know.

1218
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:56,730
Someone must have got my phone
and...

1219
01:18:58,410 --> 01:19:00,730
And who might that have been, love?

1220
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:05,769
Was this him?

1221
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:09,009
Yep. I told you.
I said I gave it to the doctor.

1222
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:10,310
He said he'd hand it in.

1223
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:17,730
-That was a good shot!
-Excellent.

1224
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:48,850
-Can I just say goodbye to my boys?
-I'm sorry. I'm afraid not.

1225
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:53,190
Right.

1226
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:04,869
This is your idea of amusement
in Whitley, is it?

1227
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:07,220
-It was a mistake.
-Mistake?

1228
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:10,619
And you stayed on at the scene to
try and put it right.

1229
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:13,610
Yes. It wasn't my fault.

1230
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,259
Why don't you tell
me how it happened?

1231
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:17,980
Sequence of events.

1232
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:20,969
I mean, I know why it happened.

1233
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:23,179
At a guess:
You thought she was cheating on you

1234
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:25,130
and that her mate was covering.

1235
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:36,769
There was a change. About four
months ago.

1236
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:39,169
She started spending all her time on
the laptop.

1237
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:42,400
She was distracted, wouldn't look me
in the eye.

1238
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:48,089
Something had happened. I'm not
stupid.

1239
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:49,739
Well, why not confront her?

1240
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:51,850
I think I didn't want
to know the answer.

1241
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:56,599
And then I found this pay-as-you-go
phone,

1242
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,570
and you don't have one of them
unless...

1243
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:03,889
Well, I'm not mad, am I, for
assuming the worst, am I?

1244
01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:07,380
Saturday.
What happened?

1245
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:09,880
<i>I got the feeling...</i>

1246
01:21:11,690 --> 01:21:14,690
<i>..it was building up a head of steam
whatever it was.</i>

1247
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:18,230
She was distant.

1248
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:21,659
She told lies.

1249
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:22,969
Like?

1250
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:27,380
Like she was going down to the
kennels when she wasn't.

1251
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:35,829
Saturday afternoon came and suddenly
she... announced that she was off.

1252
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:37,459
"Really?
Where you going?"

1253
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:39,380
"-Kennels.
-Right. Right."

1254
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,730
And I found myself...

1255
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:46,050
following her.

1256
01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:49,360
And you saw her pick up a man you
didn't know?

1257
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:54,450
It's not always been a
bed of roses between us...

1258
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,220
but the look on her face.

1259
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,159
In all the years
we've been together,

1260
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:04,350
I don't think I've ever
seen her look... so happy.

1261
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:08,139
And it didn't cross your mind they
were related?

1262
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,440
No.
Why would it?

1263
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,919
Whenever we talked about family,
she always shut me out.

1264
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,409
I learned that early on.

1265
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:16,969
But I did know that there was
someone else.

1266
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:21,010
She'd mentioned
it over the years.
Some chappy in Whitley.

1267
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:23,810
I knew there was a secret.

1268
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:27,590
She was never honest.

1269
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:32,000
If only she'd just been honest.

1270
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:36,709
And you thought she'd
revived it, did you?

1271
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:39,559
Her and this chappy from Whitley?

1272
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:40,969
Well, you hear about it, don't you?

1273
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:43,720
They meet up on the internet
again and whatever and...

1274
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:48,330
She sent him a message.
That night.

1275
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:52,490
She told him...

1276
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:58,090
She told him that she loved him.

1277
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:01,429
Well, that's it, I thought.

1278
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:03,830
You know,
I've gotta knock this on the head.

1279
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:08,249
I've... gotta put a stop to this.

1280
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:10,240
So you took her phone and lured him
into a trap?

1281
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:13,770
- Legenda nדo traduzida -

1282
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:19,960
-I just wanted to talk to him.
-But you took along a weapon.

1283
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:24,809
<i>I didn't know him. It was dark, I
was on my own.</i>

1284
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:28,489
I see.
Self-defence?

1285
01:23:28,490 --> 01:23:31,129
Exactly!
Yes!

1286
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:33,049
I said to him,
"Leave us alone"

1287
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,939
and he got aggressive,
started lashing out.

1288
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:37,359
I was just defending myself.

1289
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,350
Come on.
Really?

1290
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,699
If you'd just spoken to him, he
could have put you right.

1291
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:46,690
You could have been sat around
having a cosy little catch-up.

1292
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:50,620
I'm so sorry.

1293
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:57,410
How can I undo this?

1294
01:23:58,170 --> 01:23:59,990
You can't, love.

1295
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,569
But I just want to keep my family
together.

1296
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:06,819
Well,
that's one way of showing you care.

1297
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:09,110
Kill her eldest son.

1298
01:24:17,330 --> 01:24:20,000
You really didn't know.

1299
01:24:58,650 --> 01:25:02,399
I'd invited Paddy over.
We thought Dad was away.

1300
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,689
But Tom had told him.

1301
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:08,129
It wasn't his fault.
He was scared of Dad.

1302
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:10,910
I was too.
He was tough.

1303
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:15,290
<i>I could hear him shouting and
swearing as he came up the stairs.</i>

1304
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:17,830
<i>I panicked.</i>

1305
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:21,370
<i>Told Paddy to go out the window.</i>

1306
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:23,599
<i>There was this flat roof.</i>

1307
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,320
<i>We'd sat out there before.
I thought it was safe.</i>

1308
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:29,530
<i>Dad came in and started searching.</i>

1309
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:33,590
<i>I denied it all
but the window's wide open.</i>

1310
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:37,190
<i>Dad goes to climb out,
says he's gonna kill him.</i>

1311
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:40,969
<i>I've got hold of Dad's legs,
I'm pleading with him.</i>

1312
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:43,260
<i>Then there was just this scream.</i>

1313
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:48,250
I don't know if Paddy slipped or
lost his footing or...

1314
01:25:49,370 --> 01:25:53,090
Me and Dad were both inside. It was
an accident.

1315
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:57,540
<i>When we got to him,
he was unconscious.</i>

1316
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:00,330
<i>I put my arms around him.</i>

1317
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:02,970
<i>And then he...</i>

1318
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:11,000
When the ambulance came, Dad said
this thing about a burglary.

1319
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:15,560
Said otherwise I'd be accused.

1320
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:19,079
I shouldn't have
gone along with it.

1321
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,710
-I should have...
-He should have.

1322
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,270
He was the adult.
You were 15. You were a child.

1323
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:27,050
You should have been protected.

1324
01:27:22,290 --> 01:27:24,790
-So, how was that?
-Huh?

1325
01:27:27,130 --> 01:27:31,240
I just wish my ex-wife could've
heard it but...

1326
01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:34,600
-Thank you.
-Least we could do.

1327
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:38,170
And he wasn't alone when he died.
That's one thing.

1328
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:43,750
And he was trying to protect his
daughter.

1329
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:49,630
Maybe I'd have done the same thing.

1330
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:03,199
-Did cast a shadow.
-Who, dad?

1331
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,790
Aye, Alan.

1332
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,110
Right.

1333
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:10,920
Well, family life,
complicated, I suppose.

1334
01:28:13,690 --> 01:28:17,310
Do you really need 30,000 to move
house?

1335
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:20,420
Nah, we'll be all right.

1336
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,530
I've got a plan.

1337
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:26,229
Did you used to come down here?

1338
01:28:26,230 --> 01:28:30,160
What, back in the olden days?
The old Spanish City?

1339
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:33,890
Me dad's girlfriend used to do a
turn there.

1340
01:28:34,530 --> 01:28:36,950
Might bring the kids down here on
Saturday.

1341
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:43,430

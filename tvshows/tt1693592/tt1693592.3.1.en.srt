00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,030
What are you doing?

4
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,169
I'm using the power of coffee
and tequila

5
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,590
to make George Clooney
walk through that door.

6
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,720
Yeah...
I think he's got other plans.

7
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,150
-Maise, what was that?
-The locals are invading.

8
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,020
Right.

9
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,860
I feel sick.

10
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,990
Lizzie!

11
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,020
Hello?

12
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,350
Hello?

13
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,440
Lizzie?

14
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,339
Lizzie! Lizzie!

15
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,640
Lizzie!

16
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,130
No, no, no, no.
Lizzie?

17
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,480
Lizzie!

"Castles in the Air"

21
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,689
It was just a...

22
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,110
weekend, you know?
A girls' weekend.

23
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,100
Just the three of us,
the middle of nowhere.

24
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,980
It was Lizzie's treat.

25
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,059
That's very generous.

26
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,949
It's how she was.

27
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,370
-When did you arrive?
-Yesterday.

28
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,129
And you say you heard gunshots
last night?

29
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,830
Yeah.
Coming from across the field, I think.

30
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,169
What was going on,
do you know?

31
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,759
-No.
-No.

32
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,450
Did she have any boyfriends
at the moment?

33
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,040
But you were close?

34
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,029
She was me best friend.

35
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,150
-Could I get a glass of water?
-Yeah, sure.

36
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,469
Don't mind my asking, but...

37
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,309
how could she afford all this

38
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,370
on a physio's salary?

39
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,630
This weekend...
it was a present.

40
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,499
From one of the patients
she was helping for back pain.

41
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,979
Whiplash.

42
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,109
Very nice.
Was that typical?

43
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,410
For Lizzie.

44
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,540
She was one of those people...

45
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,290
You just want to open up to her,
you know?

46
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,280
Do you have a name for this patient?

47
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,559
-Corinne...Somebody.
-Corinne?

48
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,990
-We'll have it at work.
-Yeah. Thanks, though.

49
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,450
What will I do without her?

50
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,620
Billy?

51
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,619
There's a shotgun cartridge
full in the chest.

52
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,519
No open coffin for you, pet.

53
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,799
-Time of death?
-Half one to two am.

54
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,249
I might pare that down a bit
back at the ranch.

55
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,550
What's this?

56
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,839
Well, it's a nice little bolt hole,
this.

57
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,350
Thought I might
scan the literature.

58
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,130
Hey!

59
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,239
OK, so how are they doing
with the house-to-house?

60
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,089
A young family in the house there
think they heard gunshots.

61
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,569
Kid thought it was fireworks,

62
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,349
dad thought it was
a car backfiring.

63
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,629
-Any idea when?
-1:38 was the last one.

64
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,359
The dad was in bed,
he saw the clock.

65
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,429
There's our time of death.
They didn't see anything?

66
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,169
Not a chance.
Look.

67
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,499
"All units individually designed
to guarantee..."

68
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,559
"..the peaceful
privacy of each guests."

69
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,059
They might want
to rethink that.

70
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,820
This used to be wetlands,
as far as the eye can see.

71
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,109
-Sir?
-I've a right to be here.

72
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,909
I own these properties.
If there's a problem...

73
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,639
DCI Stanhope.
Step over here, Mr...

74
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,949
I'm fine where I am.

75
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,810
All right, just wait, love.
Get back in the car.

76
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,090
-Has somebody been hurt?
-Aye, a young woman.

77
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,239
This house?

78
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,730
And you are...?

79
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,959
Tim Hopkins.
Is she OK?

80
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,200
She was shot dead,
sir.

81
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,550
Right.

82
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,429
So...
what happens now?

83
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,879
We'll need to take care of this,
I have to let people know.

84
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,759
That's all in hand.
Her friends were with her.

85
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,639
Her friends?
And her husband?

86
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,040
Not married.

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,300
Right.

88
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,459
I'm sorry.

89
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,380
It takes a minute. My wife
just picked me up off the train.

90
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,649
There are reports that there were
gunshots in these fields last night.

91
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,210
I'd hope not.

92
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,890
Local thugs, I expect,
Saturday night.

93
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,680
I can't believe
it'd run to all this.

94
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,399
Do you have a card?
Contact details?

95
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,019
Might need to talk to you later.

96
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,320
Of course.

97
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,570
Thanks.

98
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,609
-Joe.
-Come on, sir, this way.

99
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,910
Let's go.

100
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,510
Bloody lampers.

101
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,509
Sorry, who or what are lampers?

102
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,750
Oh, Kenny, kindly inform our guest
from the city.

103
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,219
The folk that go about
by the light of the moon.

104
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,839
Plus torches, headlamps,
shooting nocturnal creatures.

105
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,419
-Pests.
-What have badgers ever done to anyone?

106
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,739
They get TB,
they pass it on to cattle.

107
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,040
Allegedly.

108
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,989
Now we're going to need
a full search of that field.

109
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,629
Let see if we can get
a ballistics match

110
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,499
between the lamper's shotgun and
the weapon that killed our victim.

111
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,809
Ask in the village.

112
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,759
Now,
it's gone someone local's

113
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,479
organising shooting sprees.

114
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,519
Ask in the farms, shops, local pubs.

115
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,870
And Kenny?

116
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,450
Pay for your own drinks.

117
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,340
Sir!

118
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,839
Robert Doran?

119
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,619
Aye, who wants him?

120
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,509
-This is DCI Stanhope, I'm DC...
-Look,

121
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,670
Look, I've got to be at the quayside
in half an hour.

122
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,780
Very dapper.
Hot date?

123
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,969
An online thing.

124
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,979
Put her on ice, Mr. Doran.

125
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,379
Search warrant for the premises.

126
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,410
-Excuse me, sir.
-Kenny?

127
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,579
Robert Doran,
you do not have to say anything.

128
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,710
It may harm your defence if you do
not mention, when questioned...

129
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,450
Come on, then, open up.

130
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,609
Robert Doran.
He's got form.

131
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,639
He went down for...

132
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,720
-GBH, eight years back.
-If you say so.

133
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,830
Listen,
mind if I sit this one out?

134
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,870
Suit yourself.

135
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,480
So last night,
early hours of this morning,

136
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,710
you were...?

137
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,689
We have evidence puts
you in the field up

138
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,009
near that new
development.

139
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,469
-Evidence?
-I hoped you'd bring that up.

140
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,059
Cigarette butts
were recovered from the field.

141
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,080
Now, thanks
to your previous conviction...

142
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,100
-Yeah, you've got my DNA.
-Right.

143
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,639
Imperial Rolled tobacco.

144
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,159
You have my sympathy.

145
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,620
Hard times if you're smoking those.

146
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,890
I could've been there any time.

147
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,730
I was there two weeks ago.

148
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,749
We've seized the shotgun

149
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,119
held under licence to
your pal Jackson Fisher -

150
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,429
-smothered in your prints.
-Any chance of a coffee?

151
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,389
The gun you fired into some
poor defenceless little beast...

152
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,149
..we found that and all,

153
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,009
and together with your tyre
prints all over the field,

154
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,830
like figures of eight...

155
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,650
-OK.
-Thank you.

156
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,479
Is this a regular thing,
this lamping?

157
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,569
You may not like it.

158
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,359
People don't complain.

159
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,980
They thank me.

160
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,369
And those weekenders down at Meadow
Pond, up for a bit of fresh air?

161
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,110
I'm no bother to anybody.

162
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,900
Anybody with you last night?

163
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,090
I was on my own.

164
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,610
Ah, that's a pity.

165
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,989
Cos this young woman
was also killed with a shotgun,

166
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,680
600 yards from the badger.

167
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,890
Do you know her?

168
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,179
How would I know her?

169
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,959
Sorry, what's my client
being charged with?

170
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,300
-Use of a weapon? Or...
-That's up to him.

171
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,360
There were other people with you
last night.

172
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,610
-Aye.
-Names.

173
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,759
Did you see anything,
hear anything,

174
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,070
while you were in that field?

175
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,479
-A car, maybe.
-Right, colour, make of vehicle.

176
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,709
-Sorry, I dunno.
-Some mechanic you are!

177
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,450
-If you saw -
-I didn't see it!

178
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,239
I might have heard a car.

179
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,750
-Might have?
-Aye.

180
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,960
Driving up the lane.

181
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,659
So what? It could've been
any one of the other guests.

182
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,299
Any tyre prints
we can't account for?

183
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,349
Too many. They use the lane
as a cut-through down to the coast.

184
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,989
See my point? Some car?
Could've been anyone.

185
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,939
OK, ballistics.

186
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,599
Was Lizzie murdered
with the same shotgun?

187
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,299
Different cartridges.

188
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,389
But it's feasible it could've
been fired from the same gun.

189
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,159
Or Doran's got a second gun stashed
away that we don't know about.

190
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,300
We'll get a report by lunchtime,
All right?

191
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,419
-PC Mark Edwards.
-Detective Constable.

192
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,960
Well, welcome to CID.

193
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,379
So what's the word
on Doran's two comrades-in-arms?

194
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,780
Yeah, the two brothers.

195
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,740
-Come on, Jim and Jackson Fisher.
-Right.

196
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,029
Confirmed Doran's story.

197
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,089
The brothers went shooting
with him Saturday night.

198
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,669
-OK.
-But they left Doran

199
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,069
in the field with the gun,

200
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,420
which I told them was
against the terms of the licence.

201
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,829
Doran then returned
the gun to them

202
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,319
a couple of hours
later that same night.

203
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,319
-What time?
-Sorry?

204
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,760
What time did they leave him
in the field with the gun?

205
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,169
Just shy of 1:30 Sunday
morning.

206
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,269
So... ten minutes
before our time of death.

207
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,109
Which is very convenient
for the brothers.

208
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,669
No, they've got an alibi.

209
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,359
They stopped for petrol at 1:41...

210
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,690
Good work,
Detective Constable.

211
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,629
Ta, thanks very much.

212
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,799
So we have Robert Doran on his own,
in the field, gun in hand.

213
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,339
It's him.
He fits the profile,

214
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,359
-he's got the form.
-But why?

215
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,089
What reason would
he possibly have

216
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,010
for shooting a woman
he's never met?

217
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,290
So.
Robert Doran.

218
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,850
Hey, don't start.

219
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,300
What?
I'm just making conversation.

220
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,610
I've been in how many
interviews with you?

221
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,849
I know how this works.

222
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,879
Oh! Go on, I'm all ears.

223
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,920
Never give up too
much information,

224
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,790
never speak so loud
you forget to listen,

225
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,720
and never ever...

226
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,059
-ask a question you don't already...
-know the answer to.

227
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,450
OK.

228
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,560
So go on, then.
What do you know about me and Doran?

229
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,019
Joe Ashworth,
still wet behind the ears...

230
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,940
-When was this?
-Eight years ago.

231
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,749
Closing time,

232
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,219
two fellas outside a
pub in South Shields.

233
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,679
In the blue corner,
fractured skull.

234
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,699
In the red corner, Robert Doran,
hardly a scratch on him.

235
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,559
You talk to the landlord,
the wives, the girlfriends.

236
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,319
End of the day you've only
got their word for it.

237
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,120
So you go with what you see.

238
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,089
He went down for 18 months.

239
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,240
-Jury convicts, not some DC.
-Yeah, I know that.

240
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,520
-But he sent me this letter.
-You did nothing wrong.

241
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,640
Hey, I'm Catholic, born and bred.
You work it out.

242
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,270
You still got it,
this precious letter?

243
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,329
Yeah.

244
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,460
-Can I see it?
-Nope.

245
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,959
He broke that man's skull.

246
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,490
No use blaming yourself,
is there?

247
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,969
-Where are we off to?
-Corinne Franks,

248
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,660
see if she can tell us any more
about Lizzie.

249
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,480
Andrew Franks?

250
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,159
Such a God-awful waste.

251
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,450
It's hit her quite hard.
Corinne!

252
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,690
Down in a bit.

253
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,889
I mean,
I never met her myself, but...

254
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,919
I know Corinne thought
the world of her.

255
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,899
Lizzie helped your wife
with her back, is that right?

256
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,269
Yeah, big time.

257
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,000
It's nuts.
This poor dead girl.

258
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,290
It makes you feel
a little responsible.

259
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,949
Why, because your wife gave her
the weekend as a present?

260
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,579
No...
Well, that as well.

261
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,599
No, we designed
all the holiday units.

262
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,750
-What, you were the architect of...?
-Meadow Ponds, yeah.

263
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,020
All our fault,
I'm afraid.

264
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,090
Well, right...

265
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,690
Well done.

266
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,020
What's this?

267
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,200
Nothing, it's mine.

268
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,099
-Corinne, this is er...
-DCI Stanhope.

269
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,769
DS Ashworth.

270
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,389
Er...it's a cathedral.
Well, it's meant to be.

271
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,759
We were students at the time.

272
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,299
Castles in the air.

273
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,170
They let you dream back then.

274
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,079
I don't know.
I don't know why I hang on to it.

275
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,189
It's a little reminder,
isn't it?

276
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,030
Why we got into it
in the first place?

277
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,840
Right.

278
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,980
-You knew Lizzie well?
-Not well.

279
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,090
But I liked her.

280
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:29,210
She never talked
about man problems or...

281
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,210
..this fella?

282
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,879
Nope.

283
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,530
But she wouldn't have done. She
wasn't the sort to dump on anyone.

284
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,469
I, I just...

285
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,809
can't see
how anyone would want to hurt her.

286
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,110
Not...

287
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,420
Not Lizzie,
not deliberately.

288
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,280
Was it quick?

289
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,820
-I mean, um...
-No, I know what you mean.

290
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,480
She died instantly.

291
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,910
-You're not just saying that?
-No.

292
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,580
You have my word.

293
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,660
-Kenny?
<i>-Ma'am, we've got him.</i>

294
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,859
<i>Robert Doran and the victim.</i>

295
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,360
<i>There is a connection.</i>

296
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,710
I'd like another word, please.

297
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,230
Robert?

298
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,210
Not him.

299
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,520
All right, wait in the car.
I won't be long.

300
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,380
So, how's the world
of online dating?

301
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,690
"GBH seeks GSOH."

302
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,080
And maybe a bit of washing-up.

303
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,010
Don't touch that,
please.

304
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,989
You and Lizzie
were at school together.

305
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,190
Bickmore Comp.
She was in the year below you.

306
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,250
Well, if I was,
I never knew her.

307
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,030
Look, are you done?
I need to get off to work.

308
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,059
Do you know what?
I've been up half the night,

309
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,670
wracking my brains.

310
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,959
The smell in this place.
Odour, I should say.

311
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,530
Once savoured,
never forgotten.

312
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,409
-Aye, and what's that?
-Trichloroethylene, pet.

313
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,490
Used to strip meat
from small mammals.

314
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,119
What are you after?

315
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,670
I grew up round a smell like that,

316
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,210
on account of me dad.

317
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,020
He had more than a passing interest
in birds of prey.

318
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,529
It got right into your pores.

319
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,189
Put paid to my love life,
I tell you that.

320
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,730
See, even if no one else
could smell it, I could.

321
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,149
And your hands - scrub, scrub.

322
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,869
"Out, damn'd spot."

323
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,320
-If your online lasses get a whiff -
-All right.

324
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,370
So what are you?
Birds, mice?

325
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,350
Take a look.

326
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,210
Sell them to art colleges
when I can.

327
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,980
Still lives and that.

328
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,480
Lizzie.

329
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,080
I've not seen her in years.

330
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,090
She was Beth back then.

331
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,689
She was not pretty,
like in this.

332
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,240
Acne, big braces, thick glasses.

333
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,380
I was a bully.

334
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,670
I was the worst of the lot.

335
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,019
But I wouldn't have touched Lizzie.

336
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,089
She had a way of...
I dunno.

337
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,580
People were always around her,

338
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,090
always talking to her.

339
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,529
Well, if I knew
what I was looking for...

340
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,879
No enemies,
never a crossed word,

341
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,429
couldn't meet a nicer woman.

342
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:45,099
We get that a lot, don't we?
It's only good manners.

343
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,530
Don't speak ill of the dead.

344
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,509
But this woman,
this Lizzie...

345
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,660
I mean, even your new friend Robert
speaks well of her.

346
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,920
What do you see?

347
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,170
Motion-detector lights.

348
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,290
Not working.

349
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:25,060
Right, door opens,
Lizzie steps out...

350
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,689
Well, he couldn't see her.

351
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,690
What if he thought
she was someone else?

352
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,139
Call Kenny.

353
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,019
Get him to round up the two lasses
who were with her that night.

354
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,019
-Maisie, was it?
-Maisie Jones and Tina Robson.

355
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,869
Aye, if one of them was the
target...

356
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,349
He's killed once,
he could try it again.

357
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,490
-What about Doran?
-No change. Surveillance.

358
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,340
Hello?

359
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,659
Just wait somewhere public.

360
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,330
No, I'll come and collect you.

361
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,159
There's a pub across the way,
the Ship Inn. Shall I...

362
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,000
<i>Yeah, I know it.
Wait for me there.</i>

363
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,450
Yeah?

364
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,519
OK, that's great.

365
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,409
Cheers, thanks.

366
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,609
Tina's at home in her flat.
Uniform's with her.

367
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,239
And the other one, Maisie?

368
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,840
-Kenny's on his way over.
-Good.

369
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,070
Yeah, good.

370
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,320
They weren't meant to be there.
Lizzie, Maisie, Tina.

371
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,219
The cottage was a treat.

372
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,219
It was booked in
that couple's name.

373
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,109
The Franks, the architects.
Want me to give them a call?

374
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,780
I want you to get over there!

375
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,820
Billy said she was hit at speed.

376
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,219
So the vehicle comes down the road
at speed,

377
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,289
mounts the pavement at speed,

378
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,150
hits at speed...

379
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,349
and drives on.

380
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,319
A joy rider, stolen car?

381
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,079
Well, look at the road.

382
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,999
Yeah, there's no skid marks
and brake.

383
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,010
The street lights were all working.

384
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,579
They could have seen
they were heading straight for her.

385
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,569
Even a joy rider's gonna start
pumping the brakes at that point.

386
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,149
All right, so not a joy rider.

387
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,420
I think she was targeted.

388
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,219
And not Robert Doran.
He was playing pool all night.

389
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,920
Surveillance watched him
the whole time.

390
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,410
Right.

391
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,310
So who, then?

392
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,250
-The husband?
-Andrew Franks? Where's the motive?

393
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,129
Kenny said he was in bits
when he spoke to him.

394
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,479
He nearly lost his wife ten months
ago in that car crash.

395
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,990
Now he's lost her for real.

396
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,530
Anyway, he gave a statement
and the alibi checks out.

397
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,719
Is he still there at the Franks',
Kenny?

398
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,310
I think so.
Why?

399
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,890
Ma'am.

400
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,080
Will do.

401
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,120
Mr. Franks,
we just need to check something.

402
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,180
Your wife's car accident last year.

403
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,720
Was anyone injured
other than herself?

404
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,150
It wasn't Corinne's fault.

405
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,120
The other driver
came out of nowhere.

406
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,090
The coroner said so.

407
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,539
Maggie Bishop, 43.

408
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,139
Nine months ago,
missed a give-way sign,

409
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,449
shot out of a junction
straight into Corinne Franks' car.

410
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,749
The coroner ruled accidental death,

411
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,139
but said Mrs. Bishop's
failure to give way

412
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,290
was a major
contributing factor.

413
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,729
God, would you look at that?
Wafer-thin bloody nonsense.

414
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,259
Shave a pig,
call it ham?

415
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,009
It ought to be an offence.

416
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,459
The husband was gonna challenge
the coroner's decision.

417
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,130
Yeah, I was coming to that.

418
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,779
Ever since the inquest
into his wife's death,

419
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,959
he's been knocking on doors,
chief coroner's included,

420
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,679
trying to get the original findings
reviewed.

421
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,650
-What does he think happened?
-That's what I'm going to ask him.

422
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,159
DCI Stanhope,
Northumberland and City Police.

423
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,460
Mind if we come in?

424
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,260
Thanks.

425
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:41,279
If it's trespassing or climbing,
they'll have a job proving it.

426
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,759
Sorry?

427
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,880
Those gorillas the council
farm out their security to.

428
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,199
The ones who escort me
out of the council offices

429
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,959
every time I ask a question
no one wants to answer.

430
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,799
I trust it was them who sent you.

431
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,219
Nobody sent me, pet.

432
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,589
Perk of the rank.
Nobody would dare.

433
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,879
No, we just wanted to...

434
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,160
talk...
about the accident.

435
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,779
Talk?

436
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,830
Yeah, you know,
find out what happened.

437
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,160
You wanna know what happened
to my wife?

438
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,660
This.

439
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,719
Well, I'm not sure
what I'm looking at.

440
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,460
No. That's the point.
Nor was she.

441
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,650
The approach to the junction
where Maggie was killed.

442
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,170
The same junction after the council
finally cut back the greenery.

443
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,889
Look at that.

444
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,639
Look at that and tell me
the crash was Maggie's fault.

445
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,039
But the coroner said
accidental death.

446
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,250
He said accidental death
for which my wife was to blame.

447
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,690
What about the other driver?

448
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,929
What about her?

449
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,280
The coroner didn't think
she'd done anything wrong.

450
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,350
Do you?

451
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,450
Dad, can you give us a hand, please?

452
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,510
Police.
About the accident.

453
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,070
I'll give you a call
when tea's ready.

454
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,599
My wife was a cleaner
at the hospital.

455
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,849
Corinne Franks was an architect.

456
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,849
Professional class,
like the council lawyers,

457
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,930
like the courts, like the coroner.

458
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,229
If she had done anything wrong,
I doubt we'd know about it.

459
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,259
The professional class
looks after its own.

460
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:35,940
Mr. Bishop, where were you last night
between 9 and 11pm?

461
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,350
-Out. Why?
-Out where?

462
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,489
Out with friends,
drinks after work?

463
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,099
I went for a walk.
It helps me sleep.

464
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,829
No,
what my sergeant's asking is,

465
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:53,399
is there anyone
who can confirm your whereabouts?

466
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,749
An alibi? You're asking me
if I've got an alibi?

467
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,320
Well, have you?

468
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,730
No.
Why, who's dead?

469
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,210
Corinne Franks.

470
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,470
No alibi.

471
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,479
He certainly has a motive -
an eye for an eye.

472
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,429
It'd be quicker to list people he
doesn't blame for his wife's death.

473
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,029
Yeah, but there's no
hard evidence to link him

474
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,470
to the deaths of either
Corinne Franks or Lizzie Faulkner.

475
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,389
Maybe there is something
in this paperwork of his.

476
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,979
No, seriously.

477
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,319
I looked at it.
He keeps details of everything,

478
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,039
every meeting, conversation,
medical records...

479
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,890
What must it be like to be his son?

480
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,089
He's just lost one parent,

481
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:45,020
and he has to watch the other one
turn into an obsessive.

482
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,429
Still, look on the bright side.

483
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,340
We've got a new suspect.

484
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,610
You won't have to see Robert Doran
any more.

485
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,390
A couple of beers
and an opening like that,

486
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,349
-it's all going to come spilling out?
-What?

487
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,890
It's a wonder you ever got anything
out of anyone.

488
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,339
I'm just saying, get it out in
the open, talk. It might help.

489
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,820
Yeah, cos that's what you
would do, isn't it, share?

490
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,360
I might!

491
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,509
Listen,
I'd better go.

492
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,400
Thanks for the drinks.

493
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,729
What we don't have is
anything to put Justin Bishop

494
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,820
in contact with Corinne Franks.

495
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:40,499
And as there's insufficient grounds
for a warrant to search his place,

496
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,140
we're gonna start looking
at the other end.

497
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,979
Now, Joe,
Corinne Franks' computer.

498
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,349
Emails, files, anything to,

499
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,999
to, from or even mentioning
Justin Bishop.

500
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,579
-Kenny...
-Not the phone records.

501
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,179
Phone records, mobile.

502
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,810
Gary, Fran, landline.
There's two, home and work.

503
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,789
Anyone wants me,
I'm with Andrew Franks.

504
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,950
Call if anything turns up.

505
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,820
I know she's dead.

506
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,100
I do know that.

507
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,089
I just can't seem to make it stick.

508
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,990
I keep turning round
to tell her what's happened.

509
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,019
Mr. Franks, is there any reason
you can think of

510
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,179
why anyone would have wanted
to harm your wife?

511
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,679
I told your colleague.

512
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,979
No.
No.

513
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,829
But when Lizzie
Faulkner was killed,

514
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,090
she was where Corinne
should've been.

515
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,349
We didn't even book the cottage.

516
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,969
We won it in a raffle.

517
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,419
It was a
champagne weekend.

518
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,570
That was a bit of a busman's holiday,
seeing as you designed them.

519
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,530
Is that why you passed on it?

520
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,750
I wanted to keep it.

521
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,519
The accident was awful for Corinne,

522
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,810
I think even more than I realised.

523
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,330
And Lizzie
had helped make it better.

524
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,999
After the accident,

525
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,759
did Corinne have any contact
with Maggie Bishop's family?

526
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,390
Yeah, she went to meet them.

527
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,949
I thought it was a bad idea,
but she felt compelled,

528
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,829
-thought it might help.
-And did it?

529
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,839
I think it was difficult
for all of them.

530
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,890
There was a son -
not a little boy, but still.

531
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:17,369
Corinne found it hard,
him having lost his mother.

532
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,479
She met them just the once?

533
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,499
Like I said,
it was difficult for all of them.

534
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,209
Yeah, But she'd have told you?
She wouldn't have held anything back

535
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,670
for fear or worrying you?

536
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,089
Corinne and I, we were a friendship
long before we were a romance.

537
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,590
We talked.

538
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,390
We're a good partnership.

539
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,060
We were good.

540
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,280
Joe...
Joe, take a look at this.

541
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,940
You never told me
you'd met Corinne Franks.

542
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,560
You didn't ask.

543
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,579
She wanted to make herself
feel better,

544
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,150
visiting the poor and afflicted.

545
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:20,439
Did you have any further contact
with her after that visit?

546
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,129
-Why would I want to?
-Mr. Bishop,

547
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,829
this is a murder
investigation.

548
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,409
If I have to keep
repeating myself,

549
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,129
we can finish this little chat
down at the station.

550
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,370
No, I never had any further contact
with her again.

551
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,629
-Can I use your computer?
-No.

552
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,250
Not finished the campaign handouts.
You'll have to wait.

553
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,939
I never met her again,
I never spoke to her again,

554
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,090
I never laid eyes on her again.

555
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,069
Ma'am!

556
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,580
We got something.

557
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,580
Same pattern every week to ten days,

558
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,699
an incoming call from a number
that's never appeared before.

559
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,779
Corinne answers.
The call lasts a minute.

560
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,659
In the next couple of days

561
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,249
the same number calls,
sometime several times a day.

562
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,559
She never picks up again.

563
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,529
Soon as she knows who it is,
she stops answering.

564
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,310
But at some point...

565
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,529
a new number shows.

566
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,170
She doesn't recognise it,
answers it...

567
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,239
..and it all starts again.

568
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,879
That wily bugger's
changing his phone.

569
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,189
Where's he buying them?

570
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,349
All these calls are from cheap
pay-as-you-go phones,

571
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,809
activated for a week,
then never used again.

572
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:31,049
I haven't managed to trace
all the phones,

573
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,789
but those I have,
without exception,

574
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:37,070
were bought within 10 miles radius
of Justin Bishop's house.

575
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,829
How far does this go back?

576
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:43,699
It starts around the time of the
crash that killed Maggie Bishop.

577
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,920
And it doesn't end
until Corinne Franks is dead.

578
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,290
How many times did you say
you met Corinne Franks?

579
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,750
Once.

580
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,265
How many times did you talk to her?

581
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,690
Once.

582
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,850
The same once.

583
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,100
Did you ever contact her
on the phone after that?

584
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,550
-No.
-Ever try?

585
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,880
No.

586
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,970
Have you got a car, Mr. Bishop?

587
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,789
I did have.

588
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,090
It was stolen.

589
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,720
When was that?

590
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,719
Three days ago.

591
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,630
I went to take Sam
for a driving lesson, it had gone.

592
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:28,549
-Did you report it stolen?
-No, I'm rolling in it, me,

593
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,980
wouldn't notice the loss of a car -
of course I bloody reported it.

594
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,270
Cos a car...

595
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,130
..did this.

596
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,710
She hit the bonnet and then
the windscreen and then the road.

597
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:55,099
And you don't have an alibi,
you were out walking...

598
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,850
on your own...

599
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,010
Mr. Bishop.

600
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,390
I didn't wish her harm.

601
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,710
Joe's confirmed
the car was reported stolen.

602
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,429
This was found
burnt out this morning.

603
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,419
Forensics are trying to rescue
all they can

604
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,989
but don't hold out too much hope.

605
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,789
Which brings it back to us
to keep on digging.

606
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,279
Anything that puts Justin Bishop

607
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,949
in recent contact
with Corinne Franks.

608
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:33,269
Or anything to tie him in
to the murder of Lizzie Faulkner.

609
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,849
We still treating that
as a case of mistaken identity?

610
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:38,900
Yes,
but here's the thing.

611
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,519
We've been assuming that
if there was contact

612
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,879
between Corinne Franks
and Justin Bishop,

613
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,169
it was hostile on his part.

614
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:51,600
Let's not forget that these two
are linked by a traumatic event.

615
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,219
And that scenario can play out
in all sorts of ways.

616
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,750
Are you serious?

617
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,460
Corinne Franks
was a good-looking woman.

618
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,149
Justin Bishop is a sad wreck.

619
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,509
And here you are, Kenny,
two marriages behind you,

620
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,860
which proves anything is possible.

621
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,670
All I'm saying is,
keep an open mind.

622
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,599
I don't want us to miss a connection

623
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,179
just cos it doesn't look like
we expect it to.

624
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,480
Joe, with me.

625
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,450
-Where are we going?
-Andrew Franks'.

626
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,230
Please tell me
we're not taking this to him.

627
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,840
-His wife and Justin Bishop?
-No.

628
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,750
Andrew Franks told me the accident
was awful for Corinne...

629
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,709
even worse than he realised,

630
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,859
as if he was starting
to sense maybe...

631
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,799
-More was going on than he knew.
-Right.

632
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,380
-Like what?
-Exactly. Like what?

633
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,759
My wife is dead,
and you come here insinuating...

634
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,259
I'm not insinuating anything,
Mr. Franks.

635
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,989
I just want you to help us

636
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:50,709
find whoever did this
by asking yourself,

637
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:55,219
is it possible there was something
your wife wasn't sharing with you?

638
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,290
-If she was threatened, for example?
-If she was, she would've told me.

639
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,849
I don't know what sad
grubby world you live in,

640
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,769
but it isn't my world.

641
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,350
And it wasn't Corinne's.

642
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,160
I trust you to see yourselves out.

643
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,869
You're right.

644
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:16,920
He's scared
of something he doesn't know.

645
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,050
CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE WON!

646
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,350
Charity raffles.

647
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,459
Where do they get their prizes?

648
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,390
They're donated usually,
aren't they?

649
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,919
How come you got involved
with the hospice?

650
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,189
My mother spent her last months
at Clarewoods.

651
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,480
I've been organising the raffle
ever since.

652
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,619
That's nice.

653
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,579
Not really. It's just a matter
of providing a prize

654
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:12,250
and chivvying or shaming other local
businesses into doing the same.

655
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,859
But yours is the biggie, right?

656
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,639
The champagne weekend.

657
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,280
Apart from the year
someone donated a chihuahua.

658
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,299
I don't know I'll be doing it again,
though.

659
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,390
It seems a bit tasteless
after what happened.

660
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,779
Where are the winners announced?

661
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,079
I mean, who would know
that Corinne and Andrew had won?

662
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,889
Anyone who was interested.

663
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:41,510
It's on the hospice website,
in the local paper.

664
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:45,290
It's as much about publicity
as raising money.

665
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:56,120
What did you think
of Corinne and Andrew...

666
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,390
..as a couple?

667
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,130
That a worse thing couldn't
have happened to nicer people.

668
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:07,399
It was the kind of relationship
you look at and think,

669
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,179
"That's how it should be done."

670
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,489
There was no sniping,
no resentments.

671
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,510
No silly games.

672
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,320
-No secrets?
-No.

673
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,110
Wasn't their style.

674
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,340
Poor sorry sod.

675
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,360
I don't know how he's gonna manage
without her.

676
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,780
Does your boss like her milk
hot or cold?

677
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,690
She thinks she's done well if it's
not come out of a carton in chunks.

678
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,709
Hey, ten minutes outside.

679
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:41,249
And then you can choose an ice cream
from the freezer.

680
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,669
Yes!

681
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:46,880
Come on. Come on,
you've been inside all morning.

682
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,680
There you go.

683
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,980
Come on, let's go.

684
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,680
Is she asking him
about Corinne and Andrew?

685
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,510
Don't worry if you can't say.

686
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:10,380
They knew her.

687
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,890
We haven't told them
how it happened.

688
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,420
Sorry.

689
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,920
Was she a friend?

690
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,620
Not really.

691
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,970
My job's the kids, this place.

692
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,350
She had her career.

693
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,179
But we used to talk sometimes.

694
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,680
Before the crash, I mean.

695
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,760
After that, she got...

696
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,460
..darker.

697
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:55,379
When I heard, I first thought
she'd done it herself, you know?

698
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,909
Deliberately.

699
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,890
Like throwing yourself
in front of a train.

700
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,319
When you say darker...

701
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,600
Oh, before the crash
she was always laughing.

702
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:07,949
Teasing Tim that he was turning

703
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,359
the countryside into a theme park

704
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,900
for people who loved the views
but not the smells.

705
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,950
And this place.

706
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,190
Tim's big project.

707
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:20,160
She used to call it Hopkins Towers.

708
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,650
She took the work, though.

709
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,989
I don't suppose she had much choice.

710
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:29,070
She and Andrew were struggling
before Tim came along.

711
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,620
Is there a chance...

712
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,270
that she did it herself, I mean?

713
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:41,430
I'm afraid
it's a murder investigation.

714
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,490
What sort of a world
have we made for them?

715
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,889
There was clearly a big change
after the accident -

716
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:52,789
enough to make Mrs. Hopkins think

717
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:55,399
Corinne may have thrown herself
in front of that car.

718
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,329
What? You think guilt, cos she was having
an affair with Justin Bishop?

719
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:00,990
I don't know.
Maybe.

720
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,199
Or maybe we're just back at the
start, and he was hounding her.

721
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,659
Either way,
she came out of that car crash

722
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,440
with the devil on her back.

723
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,559
Ma'am,
Corinne Franks' bank records.

724
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,510
Ma'am,
you need to look at this.

725
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,109
IPad, iPod dock, speakers...

726
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:17,979
She's been spending like a sailor.

727
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,769
She could have bought them for
herself.

728
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:22,450
Designer boxer shorts,
Chanel aftershave?

729
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,739
But here's the real goodies.

730
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,149
Cash withdrawals,

731
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:29,100
all made within streets
of where Justin Bishop lives.

732
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,899
And small amounts.

733
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,550
Swipe card, no PIN.

734
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,639
All in a caff,
ten minutes' walk from his house.

735
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,039
Right, Kenny, get over to that cafe.

736
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,149
I want a positive ID
on both of them.

737
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,310
-Ma'am.
-Let's bring him back in.

738
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,899
Am I under arrest, or what?

739
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,779
Not at present.

740
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,939
But I should warn you that this
interview is being recorded,

741
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,649
and an arrest may follow.

742
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,670
Someone needs to tell my son
where I am.

743
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,649
His mother drove out one day
and never came home.

744
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,990
He worries.

745
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,940
For Christ's sake don't send a
uniform, or he WILL think I'm dead.

746
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,189
Mr. Bishop,
in a previous interview,

747
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:16,769
you told me you'd had no
further contact with Corinne Franks

748
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:18,569
after your initial meeting.

749
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:20,940
-Do you still hold to that answer?
-Yes!

750
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:13,460
Gifts? Why would I have been
getting gifts from Corinne Franks?

751
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,360
Joe?

752
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,109
Those coffees
near Justin Bishop's house.

753
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,450
What time of day
were the transactions?

754
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,359
They're all around the same time,
3:30, 4:00.

755
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,910
After school.

756
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,650
Hello?

757
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,269
Ma'am,
it's Kenny from the caff.

758
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,679
Joe, she was meeting him
after school.

759
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,870
It's not the father,
it's the son.

760
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,409
Stop!

761
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:57,200
He's heading towards
Renfrew Street.

762
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,540
Stop, son!

763
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,380
Come here.

764
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:49,850
All right.

765
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,110
So what do you want to know?

766
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,909
You met Corinne once,

767
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:10,769
twice a week, after school?

768
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,070
So?

769
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,310
Did Dad know?

770
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:19,220
What else?

771
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,390
Very nice birthday present.

772
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:30,660
Who bought you that?

773
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,750
Love, it showed up
on her bank statement.

774
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:41,809
Corinne came to the house,

775
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,539
and Dad gave her one look
and thought,

776
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,329
"Spy. She's spying on us."
He wasn't ready.

777
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,949
What about you?
Were you ready?

778
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:52,250
Oh, yeah, she was a godsend.

779
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,589
Did Corinne pay for this lot?

780
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:17,880
Personally, I don't get
the whole designer label thing.

781
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:20,870
Obviously, anything catches
your eye, help yourself.

782
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,830
Well, why accept it
if you don't like it?

783
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,279
You asked her to buy this
for you, did you?

784
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,560
It's called retail therapy.
Made her feel better.

785
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,230
Didn't bring your mam back, though,
did it?

786
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,200
All this?

787
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,680
And then what,

788
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:43,519
when you'd finished
emptying her pockets?

789
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,060
What then?

790
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,789
Get fed up in the end, did you,
turn on her,

791
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,990
the woman who killed your mam?

792
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,370
No.

793
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:05,949
-Monday evening.
-I told you, I went out.

794
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:09,990
In the car? I hear you're doing
great guns with the driving lessons.

795
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,919
Boring.

796
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,389
Saturday night,
early hours of Sunday morning.

797
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,699
I was in me bed.

798
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,840
-Anyone vouch for you?
-What do you think?

799
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,790
Come on, we'll go for a drive.

800
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,350
Move!

801
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,970
I've been looking at the coroner's
report on your mam.

802
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,850
Where was she going in the car?

803
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:20,369
She was in a hurry, running late.

804
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,659
Busy wife and mother,

805
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,370
a full-time job.

806
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:27,580
Oh, she was picking you up
from school, was she?

807
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,920
Couldn't you have
just got the bus?

808
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,459
I'd missed it.

809
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,680
Well, wait for the next one.

810
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,300
Yeah, six in the evening,
late October.

811
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,360
She didn't want you coming home
in the dark.

812
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,150
She was over-protective.

813
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,550
How come you missed the bus?

814
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,169
ICT suite at school.

815
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:03,890
Lose track of time?

816
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:06,650
Yeah.

817
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,179
It was the third time that week.

818
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,950
Your poor mam.

819
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:15,939
So who called who?

820
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,819
I texted.

821
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:19,750
Did she text back?

822
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,100
-Yeah.
-What did she say?

823
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:30,850
"On my way. One of these days you'll
have to stand on your own two feet."

824
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:34,699
-And you texted back?
-Yeah.

825
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,570
And what did you say?

826
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:52,150
"Can't wait."

827
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:59,750
And maybe if she hadn't been
so bloody angry with you...

828
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:04,360
Maybe... Maybe she
wouldn't have missed that sign.

829
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,620
Your fault.

830
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,530
Ee, an idea like that...

831
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:16,639
once it gets inside you,

832
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,690
there's nothing
anyone can say.

833
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:24,750
So maybe it's what you
do now that counts.

834
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,780
Yeah, that's what she said.

835
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,810
Who, Corinne?

836
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:40,179
Dad's off crusading
against low-visibility road signs,

837
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:43,520
in walks Corinne,
no bairns of her own,

838
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,049
and after Sam's
done hating her,

839
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:48,299
she's still there,
waiting to listen.

840
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,609
-So?
-So

841
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:51,579
maybe Sam's not to blame here.

842
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:56,019
Maybe this poor kid
just lost his mam twice over.

843
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,389
-Or?
-Or what?

844
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:00,709
This poor kid has just turned 18,
right?

845
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:04,250
Did he own up to all the unanswered
phone calls to Corinne's phone?

846
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:07,070
-No, not yet.
-No.

847
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:09,850
So maybe he was
soft on her.

848
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,650
Or maybe...

849
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,360
she's soft on him.

850
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,909
<i>Ma'am,
Franks is at Hopkins' house.</i>

851
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:20,350
<i>I'll meet you there.</i>

852
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,749
I'm just asking,
were you aware

853
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:29,159
your wife was friendly
with Sam Bishop?

854
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,609
What you saying now,
that she was screwing this...

855
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,419
-What is he, 16?
-Not at all,

856
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,370
-but this was an intense friendship.
-Intense?

857
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,590
This is insane. It all sounds
like some tabloid euphemism...

858
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,369
Let me tell you.

859
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:46,719
My wife...
My wife...

860
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,289
we were solid.

861
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:52,180
We had everything -
love, work, marriage, no walls.

862
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,429
OK, Mr. Franks,

863
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:58,669
we just wanted to
establish if you knew.

864
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:01,519
No, I didn't know,
because there was nothing TO know.

865
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,390
She was over that accident.

866
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:06,639
That's not how you put it
this morning.

867
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,389
Well, it's how I'm putting it now.

868
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:11,669
She was walking, she was smiling,
she was over it.

869
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:12,970
You people.

870
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:16,079
We were trying to give him
a night off.

871
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,390
We were trying to forget
about all this.

872
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,300
Andrew Franks.

873
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,890
What's his alibi again?

874
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,200
You're looking at it.

875
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,470
A friend in need.

876
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,910
-Will you read this?
-Who's this from?

877
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:58,350
Robert Doran.
Remember him?

878
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:08,789
-When was this?
-It was years ago.

879
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:11,480
He was banged up in Acklington
Prison at the time.

880
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,760
Is it true, do you think,
what he says?

881
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,240
Yeah,
I think it probably is.

882
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,690
'Ey, now. Hang on.

883
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,839
-Did you show this to madam?
-Who, Vera? No.

884
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,290
Well, I am honoured.

885
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,669
Thing is, Joe, where I used to work,
if somebody made a mistake,

886
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:48,489
it meant ordering in more staples
or printing ink.

887
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:51,020
You know,
fur flew that day, but...

888
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,500
..in your world,
if something goes wrong, then...

889
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:02,030
-Do you think less of us?
-No, you prat.

890
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:05,920
The fact that you hung on to this
is why I hang on to you.

891
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:08,320
It makes you what you are.

892
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,790
Bet your sock drawer's
full of these.

893
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,969
I get you...
He gets what?

894
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:23,950
Look, you are not to blame.

895
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:29,570
Come here.

896
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:32,350
I'd better go.

897
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:37,450
Talk to him.

898
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:45,160
-Thanks, love.
-You're welcome.

899
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,719
So what am I?

900
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:53,040
Candy for the kid
or espresso for the old?

901
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,320
You're both.

902
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:58,710
I saw it in a film.

903
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,579
It's called <i>affogato</i>.

904
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:03,589
I figured if I blew enough cash

905
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:04,899
on stuff you didn't want,

906
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,480
maybe you'd
actually talk to me.

907
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,430
It's actually pretty good.

908
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:24,940
-Now, you and Corinne...
-Look, I've told you...

909
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,599
-we were friends.
-I know.

910
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,210
That's not what I'm asking.
Listen.

911
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,439
You remember
she said something like,

912
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,120
"If you feel you've
done something wrong,

913
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,779
"it's what you do
next that counts."

914
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:39,089
Yeah, it's called contrition.

915
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,359
Is that how she felt?
Contrite?

916
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,060
For something she'd done?

917
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:51,639
Look, you were friends, Sam.

918
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,760
Come on. She's dead.
Help me out here.

919
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,860
I'm trying.

920
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,730
Were you keeping a secret for her?

921
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:11,090
Something like that.

922
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,219
So, OK, the car accident.

923
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:19,179
She wasn't speeding,
your mam came out of nowhere,

924
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:22,019
-so how's that Corinne's fault?
-It wasn't her fault.

925
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:25,489
But she felt she was in the wrong?
She was bad?

926
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:28,269
Something on her mind.
Distracted.

927
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:29,920
She was distracted?

928
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:34,330
She wasn't on the phone. We'd
have picked that up from the log.

929
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:41,759
She was driving down the lane,
on her own. Your mam...

930
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,060
Wait.

931
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:49,230
She wasn't on her own?

932
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,080
There was someone with her?

933
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:57,750
There was someone else in the car
with her?

934
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,000
Yes.

935
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,219
Corinne wasn't alone in the car
when she crashed!

936
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,619
She lied to the police.
She lied to the coroner.

937
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,549
Whatever killed Lizzie,
killed Corinne,

938
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,329
is inside that crash.

939
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:18,749
-I want to know who was in the car.
-OK. I'm on it.

940
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:21,469
<i>-Is Joe with you?
-No. I saw him this morning.</i>

941
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:24,230
Well,
tell him to turn his phone on.

942
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:49,840
What?

943
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:52,000
Do you mind if I come in?

944
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,830
-I kept it.
-Aye? What's that?

945
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:22,530
The letter.

946
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:26,040
What?
I wrote that?

947
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,440
Yeah.

948
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,180
What did I say?

949
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:37,499
Well, your wife had just
visited you in prison...

950
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,350
and she was moving on.

951
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:45,910
-And your son.
-Right.

952
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,039
Aye, well...

953
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,670
he's a bit older than that now,
of course.

954
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:00,680
That guy I hurt.

955
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:03,549
We stepped out of the pub,

956
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:06,090
he's waiting in the street,
threatened my wife.

957
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:10,329
He threw the first punch.
I was defending myself.

958
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:13,160
-We appealed for witnesses.
-For about 30 seconds.

959
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:16,349
-It was a pub full of people.
-But nobody came forward.

960
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:18,409
No,
you were in that much of a hurry

961
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:20,490
you just cracked on anyway.

962
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:23,010
And then...

963
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,960
in court, when the jury called it,
do you know what you did?

964
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:30,309
You turned to your buddy, raised
your hand, went,

965
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:32,460
"Hey! High five!"

966
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:38,750
Hey...

967
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,290
High five.

968
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:47,630
Now, go on.

969
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,130
I was too young.

970
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:56,260
Aye, me too.

971
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,470
Hey,
you caught your killer yet?

972
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:15,579
You got lucky.

973
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:18,729
This was meant to go off
to the breakers months ago.

974
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:23,300
It was only the widower complaining
about the coroner's verdict...

975
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:25,169
Nice of you to turn up.

976
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,730
The evidence got glued up
in the system.

977
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:31,850
Here we have it.
Exhibit A.

978
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,620
Corinne's car?

979
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:39,650
We'll need you
to run it for prints and fibres.

980
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:21,440
You didn't want to see
the other effects?

981
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:27,649
Mrs. Franks was meant
to come and collect.

982
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:30,009
We sent her that many reminders.

983
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:32,699
Sometimes people
just want to forget.

984
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,390
Well, yeah, right.

985
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:42,339
-So where was this found?
-Boot of the car.

986
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:44,550
Right.
Thanks, Derek.

987
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:06,680
Overnight bag. Dirty weekend...

988
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,790
So what's with the teddy?

989
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:18,200
What's with the passport?

990
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,850
I think she was leaving him.

991
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:27,370
I think she was running away.

992
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:32,870
Hello?

993
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,800
Right.
It's for you.

994
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,000
Hello.

995
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,329
Yeah, OK.

996
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:45,630
Half an hour?

997
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:48,120
OK.

998
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:50,499
It's Robert Doran.

999
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,300
So I gather.

1000
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:56,420
-Well, he wants a word.
-OK.

1001
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:10,750
You hear that?

1002
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:13,680
Listen!
You hear it?

1003
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:18,450
It's a...
It's a fault in the turbo engine.

1004
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:22,210
It's not terminal,
just a job to fix.

1005
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:26,920
Well, I was working...
and I realised...

1006
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,429
..the car in the lane...

1007
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:32,009
The one you thought you heard
the night Lizzie was shot?

1008
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:34,650
Aye. It has the same fault
as this one.

1009
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,319
Same whine in the engine.

1010
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,679
-So you think this is...
-No,

1011
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,150
this was left here
over the weekend.

1012
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:44,170
I just...

1013
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:46,790
I just thought it might help.

1014
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:50,650
-Anyway...
-Thank you.

1015
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,950
For Beth.

1016
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:00,350
OK, everyone,
stop what you're doing.

1017
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,669
I want to know
about any pending jobs

1018
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:06,829
for vehicles
with reported turbo problems.

1019
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:10,999
All right? You can start with
garages in the Tynemouth area

1020
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,669
and then spread out.

1021
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:14,920
So come on, let's get cracking.
Come on.

1022
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:18,550
Yes.

1023
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:12,269
You can't just take him
and not say when he'll be back!

1024
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:14,509
I'm not under arrest.
I haven't been charged.

1025
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:18,419
They just need to rule me out.
Can you mind the paintwork?

1026
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:21,099
-This is ridiculous!
-Mrs. Hopkins, please.

1027
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:23,050
Hey, get back inside.

1028
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,049
Excuse me.

1029
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:26,619
Kirsty,
you need to calm down.

1030
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:29,070
You need to go back inside,
phone the solicitor

1031
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,290
and stop worrying.

1032
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,400
Corinne Franks.

1033
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:18,590
We pulled her car out of dry dock.
You know, the one she crashed in.

1034
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:24,160
It should have been scrapped by now
but sometimes we get lucky.

1035
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,480
Your prints are on the dashboard.

1036
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:32,719
I imagine they would be.
I got a lift several times.

1037
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:37,420
They're on the dashboard, the seats,
the windows - all over.

1038
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:41,389
And not just prints.
Traces of...

1039
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:44,290
"genetic material",
I think they call it.

1040
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:47,729
Delicate lot, forensics.

1041
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:50,609
Me, I like to call a spade a spade.

1042
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:55,150
Were you having a sexual
relationship with Corinne Franks?

1043
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:01,650
-I didn't kill her.
-That's not what I asked you.

1044
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,999
Mr. Hopkins,
we can wait until Forensics

1045
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,019
confirm that
what they found matches your DNA,

1046
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:15,090
-or you could save us the trouble.
-Yes. We had a...

1047
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,029
-We were seeing each other.
-An affair.

1048
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:21,079
That makes it sound
temporary and squalid.

1049
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,179
Whereas having sex
in the back of a car

1050
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,200
-with someone else's spouse...
-Love.

1051
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,050
We were in love.

1052
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:34,950
Andrew know?

1053
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:40,040
-Your wife?
-Kirsty's world is the kids.

1054
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:45,979
So you and Corinne
decide to run away together?

1055
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:49,959
Her with her little escape pod
in the boot?

1056
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,319
Clothes, toothbrush, passport.

1057
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,120
And then suddenly...

1058
01:14:57,070 --> 01:15:00,669
Someone else's world
crashes right into yours

1059
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:03,130
and everything changes.

1060
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:12,820
Recognise these numbers?
Telephone numbers.

1061
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,849
She wouldn't answer
if she knew it was me.

1062
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:29,620
What happened to love?

1063
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,040
There was a moment in the crash...

1064
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:40,689
a revelation,
she called it, that...

1065
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:43,130
..if she was gonna die,
I wasn't the man

1066
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,309
she wanted by her side,
not the man

1067
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:47,850
she wanted to die with.

1068
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,540
So she went back to her husband.

1069
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:03,629
And you hounded her
with phone calls.

1070
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:06,990
And when that didn't work -
the raffle.

1071
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,680
Did you fix the raffle

1072
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:12,210
for her and Andrew to win?

1073
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:14,249
Reeling her back in.

1074
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:16,559
We made love in every room
in that house.

1075
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,879
If being there again
didn't bring her to her senses...

1076
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,050
A shotgun to the chest would?

1077
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,660
I didn't kill that girl.

1078
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,779
I didn't kill Corinne.

1079
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:31,389
Yet here you are,
the jilted lover,

1080
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:33,099
with a motive,

1081
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,929
and, as Forensics
have just confirmed,

1082
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:39,390
the car that killed Corinne Franks.

1083
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,819
What do you mean Forensics

1084
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:45,189
have just confirmed
it was my car?

1085
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:46,499
What are you talking about?

1086
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,629
Traces of Corinne Franks's blood
on the front bumper.

1087
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:51,879
Brain tissue on the windscreen.

1088
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,650
Where were you
the evening she was killed?

1089
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,020
I was...

1090
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,190
with her husband.
I was with Andrew.

1091
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,359
When Lizzie Faulkner was shot?

1092
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,660
I was away...
on business.

1093
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,700
And your wife?

1094
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,250
Mr. Hopkins, where was she?

1095
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:21,290
<i>She couldn't have known
about Corinne.</i>

1096
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,329
<i>It's the kids.</i>

1097
01:17:24,330 --> 01:17:26,540
That's all she sees, is the kids.

1098
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:32,460
-Come on.
-Where are we going?

1099
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:34,990
We're going to play a game.

1100
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:40,649
<i>Yes or no.</i>
Did your wife have access to a gun?

1101
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:42,259
Her father had an old weapon.

1102
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:45,629
-Where's it kept?
-In a cabinet under the stairs,

1103
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:47,690
-under lock and key.
-Who has a key?

1104
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,880
-We both do.
-Joe.

1105
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,989
-Hey, I thought we were waiting.
-We are waiting.

1106
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:10,590
I'm just going to take a little peep.
You stay where you are.

1107
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:05,319
<i>Joe. It's OK. The gun's
still locked in the cupboard.</i>

1108
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,950
But we'll need to...

1109
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:11,490
Ma'am?

1110
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:17,750
Hold on, love.

1111
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:19,730
Kirsty?

1112
01:19:32,970 --> 01:19:35,160
Are the kids with you, love?

1113
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,260
Kirsty?

1114
01:20:17,470 --> 01:20:18,770
Love...

1115
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,700
Come on.

1116
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:32,880
Pick up.

1117
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:37,249
Kirsty, love.

1118
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:39,899
We just want to know
that you're all right.

1119
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,239
<i>Well, we're not.</i>

1120
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,540
<i>Vera!</i>

1121
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,419
<i>What's that man doing?</i>

1122
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:49,330
-What man's that, love?
<i>-Vera!</i>

1123
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:57,230
Ma'am.

1124
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,870
Come down, love.

1125
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:17,150
<i>We're not coming down,
are we?</i>

1126
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:20,230
We're not leaving this house.

1127
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,370
Tim's going spare over you lot.

1128
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,330
He puts on a good show,
that man.

1129
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:30,860
He has no feelings for any of us.

1130
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:33,170
Does he?

1131
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,770
Mum...

1132
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,010
It's OK.

1133
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:42,050
Hey, Kirsty, I'm interested.

1134
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:47,619
How did you find out
about your husband and...

1135
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:48,920
Corinne?

1136
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:53,450
I kept finding
all these phones he had.

1137
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,880
<i>He only ever called one number.</i>

1138
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,809
<i>Tell that man not one more step.</i>

1139
01:21:59,810 --> 01:22:01,110
Joe.

1140
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,210
No one wants to hurt you.

1141
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,360
Yeah, they do.
Here they all come.

1142
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:32,430
It's absolutely too late.
You see that, don't you?

1143
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,710
I'll tell you what.

1144
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:39,379
You're a wonderful mother
to those two bairns.

1145
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:42,419
But don't you see? That's just it.

1146
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:46,820
If I go, who'll look after them?
How will they manage?

1147
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:49,589
They'll be taken care of.

1148
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,119
No.

1149
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,950
It's me they look to.

1150
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:57,879
Always have done. <i>Ever since the
minute they came into this world.</i>

1151
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,180
<i>If I go...</i>

1152
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,160
Well, you see?

1153
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:05,549
They have a father.

1154
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:08,570
<i>He may have lost sight of you
for a minute, but...</i>

1155
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:13,089
<i>they mean all the world to him.</i>

1156
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:15,629
-More than her?
<i>-More than anything.</i>

1157
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:17,680
I don't think so.

1158
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,320
He'll be there.

1159
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:25,390
<i>And one day,</i>
somewhere down the line...

1160
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:28,190
..so will you.

1161
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:34,080
Mum, there's a man.

1162
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:37,880
Come on, please.
Give them a chance.

1163
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,320
Come on.
There we go.

1164
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:02,090
<i>Ma'am, it's OK.
I've got the kids.</i>

1165
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:12,760
No, Kirsty!

1166
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,129
You'll wait for them!
I know you will!

1167
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:19,890
I know that's what you want!

1168
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:31,699
<i>Why?</i>

1169
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:34,610
Because when I called you
just now...

1170
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:38,290
..you answered the phone.

1171
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,420
Kirsty!

1172
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:51,410
Joe?

1173
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:54,850
It's the taxi, love.

1174
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:04,080
Joe.

1175
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:29,960
Joe, love.
Taxi.

1176
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:37,080
Come on.
Meter's running.

1177
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,610
-You been smoking?
-Don't be daft.

1178
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:46,190
Really?

1179
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:57,839
-Right. I'll see you.
-Yeah. Night, love.

1180
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,140
Night-night.

1181

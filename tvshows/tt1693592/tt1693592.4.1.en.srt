1
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:09,944
# All things bright and
beautiful

2
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:14,224
# All creatures great and small

3
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:19,504
# All things wise and wonderful

4
00:00:19,944 --> 00:00:23,904
# The Lord God made them all

5
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:26,704
Come on, love. Hurry up.

6
00:00:27,864 --> 00:00:30,224
Come on. We're gonna miss the train.
Quick.

7
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,903
I thought Mum said we were getting a
taxi.

8
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:34,823
We're too good for the train now,
are we?

9
00:00:34,824 --> 00:00:37,463
Here, take that. That'll tide you
over till dinner.

10
00:00:37,464 --> 00:00:39,943
Thanks, Dad.
And, anyway, it's early.

11
00:00:39,944 --> 00:00:42,824
So with a bit of luck, we might have
the train to ourself, eh?

12
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:49,343
Hey. Watch what you're doing, will
you?

13
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:51,223
Sorry, mate.
It's OK. Doesn't matter.

14
00:00:51,224 --> 00:00:52,824
Are you all right?

16
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:35,064
Oi.

17
00:01:56,744 --> 00:01:58,463
Right?

18
00:01:58,464 --> 00:02:00,504
Not too hot?

19
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:06,903
We regret to inform you
that this train is no longer in service.

20
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:10,704
There is a rail replacement service
waiting for you outside the station.

21
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:14,424
Come on.

22
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:18,183
Do we get the bus now?

23
00:02:18,184 --> 00:02:20,143
Let me just call your mum.

24
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:21,624
Come on.

25
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,223
Dad?
What?

26
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:28,023
They need to wake up the lady.

27
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:31,143
It's OK. The guard'll find her. Come
on. What if they don't?

28
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:32,784
Go on, then, just be quick.

29
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:35,464
I'm watching you, Jess.
Quick as you can!

30
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:44,904
Miss?

31
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:51,944
Jess? Jessie?

32
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:55,423
Jessie!

33
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:57,024
Hey! Open up!

34
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:12,045

35
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:14,023
She was a woman in her sixties.

36
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:17,103
Oh, come on, star witness.
You can do better than that.

37
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:18,623
All right.

38
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:21,383
Jessie thinks she boarded the train
same time we did.

39
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:23,223
Jessie?
How many times...

40
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:25,743
Jessie. My eldest.
Yes. I know that.

41
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:27,743
I just didn't know you had her with
you.

42
00:03:27,744 --> 00:03:30,064
She sings in the choir up at St
Teresa's.

43
00:03:40,184 --> 00:03:41,704
Cameras?

44
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:44,223
No. Nothing yet.

45
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,143
Injury?

46
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:48,503
She's got stab wounds to the lower
back.

47
00:03:48,504 --> 00:03:51,984
What is it they say in training?
Muggers tend to confront you.

48
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:59,424
Well, she's cash rich. So not a
mugging.

49
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:03,063
Any fights on the train?
It wouldn't surprise us.

50
00:04:03,064 --> 00:04:05,104
They were all out this evening.

51
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:08,024
Margaret who?

52
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:12,704
Margaret Krasz... Kraszewski?

53
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:17,744
Central Station to Mardle.

54
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:22,903
She's a bit posh for Mardle, isn't
she?

55
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:25,303
I'm gonna have to talk to your lass.

56
00:04:25,304 --> 00:04:27,063
Yeah.

57
00:04:27,064 --> 00:04:29,863
Yeah, I know. But just wait till
morning, will you?

58
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:31,344
As a favour.

59
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:34,704
Come on, love.

60
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:38,023
Hey, you know I hate to ask, love.

61
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:42,023
But I gather our Jessie
saw the victim get on the train.

62
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:45,663
Look, I told him to get a taxi.
But you know our Joe.

63
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:47,984
Nothing comes between him and a £10
note.

64
00:04:50,744 --> 00:04:52,183
My mistake.

65
00:04:52,184 --> 00:04:54,263
Lock him up, somebody!

66
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:57,303
Cases like this, always the off-duty
copper.

67
00:04:57,304 --> 00:04:59,383
Who's this?
Pathologist.

68
00:04:59,384 --> 00:05:01,783
Marcus Summer. The new guy.

69
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:04,223
See you tomorrow, pet.

70
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:06,503
Lucky fella.

71
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:09,504
The body's on the train,
if you'd care to take a look.

72
00:05:29,304 --> 00:05:30,743
Ryan!

73
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:34,703
Give your brother a shout, will you?
I've got guests in the conservatory.

74
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:36,184
Ryan!

75
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:45,384
Oi! What you doing?

76
00:05:47,424 --> 00:05:50,903
Are you doing his maths homework
again? No.

77
00:05:50,904 --> 00:05:52,623
Chlo?
It's just this once.

78
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:55,223
How will he get on if you keep doing
his homework for him?

79
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:57,623
Anyway, how did you get so rich?
Baby-sitting.

80
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,543
That is hilarious.
Who'd let him loose on a baby?

81
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:02,543
How will you get by
if you don't do your own work?

82
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:04,383
Can you just get off my back,
please?

83
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:07,184
At least read a book. It won't kill
you. I read.

84
00:06:09,344 --> 00:06:11,143
Yeah? Read that.

85
00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:13,783
Bathroom freshener.
It's the same difference.

86
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:15,863
Give us that money.
Give us me money!

87
00:06:15,864 --> 00:06:18,103
Mum!
Pack it in, the pair of you!

88
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:20,184
Tosser.
Serves you right.

89
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:26,464
Kate Darrow?

90
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:32,183
I'll give the kids a lift in.
They missed the bus.

91
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,063
Second time this week. You're on a
hat trick. Don't blame me!

92
00:06:35,064 --> 00:06:39,504
The music teacher here forgot his
coffin! Double bass. Sorry.

93
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:42,623
Want me to stay?

94
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:44,184
No, no. It's fine.

95
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:47,183
All right. I'll call you.

96
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:49,264
All right, come on, then, you two!

97
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:56,103
I can't tell the kids just yet.
They were very fond of Margaret.

98
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:59,143
Is that your husband?
Stuart? No he's my fiance.

99
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:01,103
He's a teacher at the kids' school.

100
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:04,104
Kate, why don't you show us
Margaret's room?

101
00:07:04,984 --> 00:07:07,263
Sure. Yeah.

102
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:11,503
I was left the house ten years ago,
by an aunt, after my husband died.

103
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:13,543
Margaret was sort of sitting tenant.

104
00:07:13,544 --> 00:07:16,543
It was her bright idea
to turn it into a guest house.

105
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:20,424
They'd extended the train line.
People said Mardle was on the up.

106
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,303
How long was Margaret living here?

107
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:47,863
Oh, since forever.

108
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:49,984
1980-something.

109
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:53,223
She was my anchor.

110
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:56,103
She helped with the accounts -
book-keeping was her thing -

111
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:59,823
and practically raised the kids when
I was off running for world's worst mum.

112
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:02,344
Ryan used to call her "Mam", as they
do.

113
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:06,983
Kraszewski?
She wasn't Polish or anything.

114
00:08:06,984 --> 00:08:10,143
No. She married a fella from
Krakow... before my time.

115
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:13,143
It... It didn't last.
Oh, is he still local?

116
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:14,983
I don't think so.

117
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:18,983
Have you any idea why Margaret was heading
into town, who she was seeing, or...?

118
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:20,623
No. I didn't know she'd gone out.

119
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:24,223
Did she talk to you about anything on
her mind?

120
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:26,344
Any trouble she might be in? Hm?

121
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:30,183
It was an accident, though, right?

122
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:32,264
Well, we don't know yet.

123
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:36,983
Anyway, there was never any trouble
Margaret couldn't sort out.

124
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,944
If you didn't find her here,
she was at Holypool House.

125
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:44,423
A shelter for vulnerable women -
Margaret's flock.

126
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,784
Chloe says that's where
I'll end up.

127
00:08:48,464 --> 00:08:50,904
She had such nice manners -
Margaret.

128
00:08:52,104 --> 00:08:54,424
She made you feel very safe up here.

129
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,063
Are we decent?

130
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:00,903
I heard voices.
This is George.

131
00:09:00,904 --> 00:09:03,343
George is one of our most loyal
guests. "One of"?

132
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:06,703
I've been coming here how long?
Eight... Eight years, George.

133
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:08,863
Margaret never raised her voice.

134
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:11,463
Always the most tremendous help if
needed.

135
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:14,423
This outward calm and generosity,
but...

136
00:09:14,424 --> 00:09:18,303
Well... I always liked to think of
her as some sort of Cold War spy -

137
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:20,383
an air of things held back.

138
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:22,543
Perhaps it was just the name -
Kraszewski.

139
00:09:22,544 --> 00:09:25,744
Well, that's my stock in trade, you
see - spy novels.

140
00:09:26,424 --> 00:09:28,783
George is a rep for a publishers,
aren't you, love?

141
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:31,703
Yes. Words are my world.

142
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,663
I've been up in Scotland, doing my
rounds.

143
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:36,143
Back home to Northants after
luncheon. George.

144
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:38,543
Oh, I'm so stupid.

145
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,343
You sit yourself down, love.
I'll put the kettle on.

146
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:42,463
George.

147
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:45,624
You don't know why Margaret
went into town yesterday?

148
00:09:46,424 --> 00:09:48,263
No. No, no.

149
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:52,304
Oh, erm... here's my card,
if for any reason...

150
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,063
So what do you think?
Move out here with the kids?

151
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:02,464
More room? Fresh air?
Nah.

152
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,143
You're joking! Don't be so tight.
Come on, just give us a drink!

153
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,503
Come on. No! I'm gonna have to ask
you to leave.

154
00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:49,744
Margaret Kraszewski. What was she
doing, stuck in that house 30-odd years?

155
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:53,104
Something about that set-up feels
very weird.

156
00:10:53,864 --> 00:10:55,943
What? Weird eerie or what?

157
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:59,103
Weird... Well, familiar.

158
00:10:59,104 --> 00:11:02,064
Don't be so tight!
Somebody...?

159
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:04,103
The train?

160
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:06,303
Gary, would you put the lady out,
please?

161
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:08,023
Come on.
Get off me!

162
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:09,903
Get off me!
Come on, out.

163
00:11:09,904 --> 00:11:11,423
It's a crap pub, anyway!

164
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:13,464
Take your coat with you.

165
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:16,504
I'm sorry I'm not much use.

166
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:22,624
Well, we'll get Shep to round up the
alibis of the family and the guests.

167
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:25,344
Will do.

168
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:29,423
You sleep on the sofa?
No.

169
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:31,024
Hm?

170
00:11:32,264 --> 00:11:34,264
It was the futon, actually.

171
00:11:37,384 --> 00:11:39,224
How is erm...

172
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:42,544
Jessie?
Yeah, Jessie.

173
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,423
She'll get there.

174
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:49,424
We will have to talk to her.

175
00:11:50,264 --> 00:11:51,783
Yeah.

176
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:53,384
I know.

177
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:56,784
Any sign of a struggle?
No.

178
00:11:59,504 --> 00:12:02,584
Single incision... here.

179
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:05,503
Long, slim blade.

180
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:08,064
She'd have felt it. No great
discomfort.

181
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:12,663
Subcutaneous fat closes over the
wound, so not much bleeding.

182
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:14,344
Not much to see.

183
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:18,103
Oh, and you got your murder weapon
yet? Nope.

184
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:22,183
OK. Well, the wound has a little
kink in it.

185
00:12:22,184 --> 00:12:24,144
In the flesh.
Meaning?

186
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:26,664
So did the blade.

187
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:30,383
Murder weapon has a kink?
Partially broken edge.

188
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:33,623
But how do you stab someone in the
back who's sitting down?

189
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:37,943
That, my love, is a riddle wrapped
in a mystery... in a... How does it go?

190
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:40,503
Enigma... inside an enigma.

191
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:42,744
That's right.
Your welcome.

192
00:12:46,544 --> 00:12:48,623
Anything else?

193
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:49,903
Cancer.

194
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:52,783
First in the pancreas,
then spread to the bowel.

195
00:12:52,784 --> 00:12:56,103
So, game over.
She was into the last weeks.

196
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:57,704
Thank you.

197
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:02,943
What you looking so pleased about?
Well...

198
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:05,504
he's better than the last one, isn't
he?

199
00:13:54,504 --> 00:13:56,383
It's all right. Hey.

200
00:13:56,384 --> 00:13:58,263
Jess. Jess.

201
00:13:58,264 --> 00:14:00,943
Shh.
Did they find it?

202
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:03,303
Love...

203
00:14:03,304 --> 00:14:05,063
Love, wake up.

204
00:14:05,064 --> 00:14:06,743
It's just a bad dream.

205
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:09,383
Just a nasty dream. That's all.

206
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:11,464
Dad?
What?

207
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:13,704
She was so cold.

208
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:55,951
Hey, you remember me, love?

209
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:58,072
Mussolini.

210
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:01,169
Who?

211
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:04,729
You had questions?

212
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:11,729
That woman on the train, love.

213
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:13,849
You saw her, didn't you?

214
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:17,009
Was there anyone with her?

215
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:19,289
No?

216
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:23,008
Love?

217
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:25,208
She smiled at me.

218
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:26,888
What, love?

219
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:28,969
She smiled at me.

220
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,369
She was...
Cold. I know.

221
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:02,848
What am I looking at?
It's the kids' mobile phone footage.

222
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:04,488
Is that her?

223
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:07,528
Margaret?
Alive at 7:51.

224
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:10,048
The train just left Central Station.

225
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:11,648
So Margaret was stabbed

226
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:15,449
somewhere between Central Station
and Partlington.

227
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,689
So... crowded train...

228
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,609
Then what happened?

229
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:28,329
What, some pisshead after her seat?

230
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:31,648
Got in the way of a fight? Mm?

231
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:33,568
Wrong place, wrong time?

232
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:35,288
Mistaken identity?

233
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:38,408
Then knife went into her lower back,
so she'd need to be standing.

234
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:40,968
Ma'am, lab report.
Six-inch lock-knife.

235
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:43,648
Some kids found it in an estuary
near Mardle.

236
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:46,128
Their mam brought it in this
morning. And?

237
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:48,528
Well, it's got a broken edge.
It's a physical fit?

238
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,088
Yeah. It's a perfect match.

239
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:51,729
Photos?
Here.

240
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,928
Mardle...

241
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:57,369
So potentially a local.

242
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:01,369
It's a small town...
so they may have known her.

243
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:04,848
And our victim has an ex-husband.

244
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,568
Ma'am.
Pavel Kraszewski. I want him found.

245
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,768
I mean, where was he?
Did they get on?

246
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:12,928
Kenny, chase up the murder weapon.

247
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:15,129
Ah, you'll want to hear this.

248
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:18,529
So let me just get this straight.

249
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:24,289
My victim was here, Thursday, to see
you?

250
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:27,688
You're quite correct. It's all
logged here. Oh, aye.

251
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:30,408
Here she is. Signed in at five to
five.

252
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:33,448
Then, as you can see, she left...
Signed out at twenty to six.

253
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:38,408
So, she sat here in our reception
for 45 minutes and left without...

254
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:42,568
Sorry... As I said, I were on
training at the time, doing my IT skills.

255
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:47,768
Um... Obviously, I did arrange for a follow-up
appointment but the lady didn't attend.

256
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:50,769
So it was... No, pet, she was
held up - at the morgue.

257
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:54,248
Oh...
So how was it?

258
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:56,608
What, sorry?
The course? The IT?

259
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:00,328
Oh, yeah. That were really good.
It was in one ear, out the other.

260
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,928
So you've no idea
why Margaret made that appointment?

261
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:05,568
Erm... No, I don't.

262
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:07,049
Sorry.

263
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:12,449
But she'd have phoned the station
to make the appointment?

264
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:14,208
Yes.

265
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,648
So your lot would have recorded the
call.

266
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:18,528
For training purposes.

267
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:20,569
Yes, I believe they would.

268
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:22,608
So?

269
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:25,369
Shall I get it?
Take a wild guess.

270
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:29,128
And, can I ask, what's the
nature of the appointment?

271
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:31,608
I... I can't say over the
phone.

272
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:35,648
It's just it would help if you need to talk
to anyone with the right experience.

273
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:40,568
Oh, if we could just sit
down, I think, go through our options...

274
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:43,688
Very well...
And anything that's said...

275
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,169
Will be taken in strictest
confidence.

276
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:49,928
She came into town to talk to us.

277
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,929
Christ.

278
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:55,328
Local killer, targeted attack,
surely?

279
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:57,288
Someone stabbed her because of...

280
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:59,488
Aye, for whatever it was she was
going to say?

281
00:18:59,489 --> 00:19:03,409
It's a hypothesis.
Or sheer bloody coincidence.

282
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:07,368
She doesn't sound like I thought she
would.

283
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:10,009
Yeah? What does she sound like?

284
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:14,169
Smaller.

285
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:19,289
Let's see what they say at this
woman's shelter.

286
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:24,288
Right, then. Who wants the
brontosaurus?

287
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:28,568
No, wait there. Just wait a second.
I'm gonna make you one. Don't worry.

288
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:31,569
A pound each. Includes free raffle
tickets.

289
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:35,129
No concessions, I'm afraid.

290
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:38,488
Jane Robinson?

291
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:40,689
Can you manage for a bit, love?
Yeah.

292
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:47,488
How many people have you got here?
We take all comers.

293
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:49,808
Any women with no home to go to.

294
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:52,728
Even vulnerable youngsters
like our Emily here.

295
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:55,488
Hello, love.
Just out of foster care.

296
00:19:55,489 --> 00:19:57,929
We're learning to stand up to peer
pressure.

297
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:00,089
And all that entails.

298
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:03,449
Lemonade?

299
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:10,009
No, you're all right, thanks.
No, go on. I'll have it, love. Thanks.

300
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:15,088
Do they know?

301
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,328
About poor Margaret?
Aye.

302
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:20,848
Some of them were quite dependent,
which I don't encourage.

303
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:22,449
Why not?

304
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,449
Here... Go do your worst.

305
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:30,249
I'm just gonna do one, OK?

306
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:33,729
Just one.

307
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,408
Get off!

308
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:40,649
Why do you have to be an idiot?

309
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:46,928
# White summer moon

310
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:49,488
# Went on shining all summer day...

311
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:51,528
I don't believe it. White Summer
Moon.

312
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:54,088
# White summer moon

313
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:57,728
# And all the ghosts came out to
play

314
00:20:57,729 --> 00:21:02,168
# And I see it when I look at you

315
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:05,448
# There's something in your eyes...

316
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:08,408
It's a fiver a pop.
All proceeds go to this place.

317
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:09,968
It's Mum's comeback CD.

318
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,529
You must be very proud.

319
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:14,488
One way of putting it.

320
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:18,128
It's so good to get her out of the
house. She's taken it very hard.

321
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:20,849
I bet you all have.
It's more the shock.

322
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:24,888
Ryan was always her favourite.

323
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:28,088
Much good it did him.
There weren't any favourites.

324
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:30,809
Yeah, right.
Says the man who hardly knew her.

325
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:33,609
OK, fair point. Go on, get lost.

326
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:40,488
Margaret? Well, If there was trouble,
she wouldn't make a song and dance.

327
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:44,168
Though I must say, these past weeks,
she did seem more than usually het up.

328
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,488
Oh?

329
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:48,128
One of my women - Dee Sinton.

330
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:51,049
First we had money going missing
from pockets.

331
00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:53,489
Next thing after that, I discovered
this.

332
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:57,088
She'd been having cards printed, you
see.

333
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:00,368
She actually printed our
phone-number - here at the house -

334
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:02,769
so I handed her back to social
services...

335
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,808
..which Margaret saw as some great
desertion.

336
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:09,888
Ah, well, it can't be easy.
Why are you here? Just get off!

337
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:11,488
Stay away!
What's up with you?

338
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:14,849
What now?
Come on. What's up with you? Oi?

339
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,849
# Burning all night...

340
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:30,928
I'm sorry.

341
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:33,089
I'm sorry.

342
00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:58,129
Oh, if we knew why she came into the
station.

343
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:02,728
Something on her conscience
the killer wanted to keep buried?

344
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:04,648
Last confession?

345
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,169
But what?

346
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,488
What are you smiling at?

347
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:11,408
You sure you weren't brought up a
Catholic?

348
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:14,288
No higher beings for me, pet.
Except raptors.

349
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:16,088
Hm.

350
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:19,008
So I worked out why Kate Darrow
seemed so familiar yesterday.

351
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:20,528
Yeah?

352
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:22,928
Katie Guthrie. White Summer Moon.

353
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:26,409
It's her. It's the same woman.
Celine loves that song.

354
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:29,208
Has she got an alibi?
Yep.

355
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:31,968
She was rehearsing in the city.
Stuart gave her a lift home.

356
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:35,128
Oh, so what's this?
Your special song, is it?

357
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:37,648
No. We don't have a special song.

358
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:38,968
No?

359
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:41,209
New CD. You'll be wanting the
afternoon off.

360
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:43,608
Well, I'm sorry, pet.

361
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:47,369
I'm impounding this music...
for police purposes.

362
00:23:50,449 --> 00:23:52,448
Where are we going, anyway?

363
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:54,769
Round up the last of Margaret's
flock.

364
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:09,009
Hello?

365
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:28,769
She'll be up on the roof -
falling off, with any luck.

366
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,049
Excuse us, love.

367
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:56,608
DCI Vera Stanhope.

368
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:58,729
DS Joe Ashworth.

369
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:01,568
Margaret Kraszewski.

370
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,409
Eh?

371
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:05,888
Oh, aye. Yeah.

372
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:08,569
Could you tell us what you were
doing on Thursday evening?

373
00:25:09,449 --> 00:25:11,489
Thursday?

374
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:15,008
Wh... What?
Today's Sunday, love.

375
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:17,289
So three nights ago...

376
00:25:18,129 --> 00:25:20,248
Pub?

377
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:22,609
City. I met a fella.

378
00:25:23,929 --> 00:25:26,848
Name?
Jason.

379
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:29,128
He'll vouch for you, will he?

380
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:31,129
Oh, aye. Yeah. Yeah.

381
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:33,928
You got a number?

382
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:35,968
No.

383
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:38,129
How'd you get home, love?

384
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:40,488
Bus? Train?

385
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:41,969
Who says I got home?

386
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:46,649
I can't help it if the lads like
what I do for 'em, now, can I?

387
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:50,648
Did you know her well, would you say?

388
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,129
Who?
Margaret.

389
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:56,568
Oh...

390
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:58,288
We were old friends, yeah.

391
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:02,008
When was the last time you saw her?
Couple of weeks back.

392
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:05,449
Did she say anything to you
about going to the police at all?

393
00:26:06,889 --> 00:26:08,369
No.

394
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:12,088
I already told that slag up at
Holypool. I'm no thief.

395
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:14,048
Ah... This is the missing money?

396
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:18,289
I said to her I was brought up
honest and decent, with dignity.

397
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:31,689
Listen. This is my card. If you...

398
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:53,649
Where's she going?

399
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:56,449
You all right, love?

400
00:26:57,769 --> 00:26:59,569
Lend us a quid, eh? For the bus?

401
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:05,168
Going somewhere nice?
City.

402
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:08,729
Places to be, folks to meet.
Oh. Early start?

403
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:13,089
Give her a quid.

404
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:21,609
Cheers.
Good luck, love.

405
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:34,088
What are you drawing, love?

406
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:36,729
It's the lady... The lady on the
train.

407
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:42,289
What's that?

408
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:48,528
Her coat.

409
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:50,209
But she wasn't wearing a coat.

410
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:54,408
Is that why she was cold?

411
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:55,889
Someone had taken her coat?

412
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:03,409
Hi, darling? You all right?

413
00:28:24,447 --> 00:28:27,127
Come on, look lively! Listen to Joe.

414
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:30,008
Dee Sinton lied to us. She was on
that train. She must've been.

415
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,368
She went home wearing the victim's
coat.

416
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:35,128
So is that what this was?
A fight over a coat?

417
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:37,528
Edwards, how are we doing
with the murder weapon?

418
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:39,248
Dead end so far.

419
00:28:39,249 --> 00:28:42,368
It's a standard lock knife.
The spec's at least ten years old.

420
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:46,489
Would Dee have carried a knife?
Protection? Ma'am. We've got her.

421
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,728
So how is your Jess?

422
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:55,808
Celine's keeping her off school for
a bit. Yeah?

423
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:58,528
Family Liaison put us in touch with
a counsellor.

424
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,608
Oh. We're OK with that?

425
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:03,329
- Course. If it helps.
- Look, just give us the coat!

426
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:07,648
What's going on? I'll stop grabbing
you if you give it to us!

427
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:10,448
She's in there. She won't come out.
Stop grabbing my arm!

428
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:14,049
Cooperate. All right, love,
that's enough. Out you come.

429
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:19,569
This fellow here in a uniform,
come on, give him your coat.

430
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:23,369
There's a good girl.

431
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:27,609
We've had a hell of a job finding
you.

432
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:30,809
Been half way round Mardle.

433
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:35,008
Where are you going now, love?
Anything to get away from you!

434
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:37,088
There's nothing for you up there,
love.

435
00:29:37,089 --> 00:29:39,088
Just leave me alone.

436
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:42,248
Here you are, pet. Take this.

437
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:45,049
I'm not wearing that.
It stinks of jellyfish.

438
00:29:46,569 --> 00:29:48,689
Is she with you two?

439
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:53,409
She was up by the spit this morning.
Looking a bit worse for wear.

440
00:29:55,689 --> 00:29:57,729
How did she come by that shiner?

441
00:29:58,449 --> 00:30:00,249
She can talk for herself.

442
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:03,208
Banged me head.

443
00:30:03,209 --> 00:30:05,009
Ma'am?

444
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:09,209
Ooh. What have we here?

445
00:30:10,649 --> 00:30:14,488
Thursday evening, you met Margaret on
the train.

446
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:16,288
Aye, if you say so.

447
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:18,369
Why didn't you say so before?

448
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:22,688
I was, hungry. I can't think when
I'm hungry.

449
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:23,768
Oh...

450
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:25,449
There you go, love.

451
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:28,328
I'm not eating your litter.

452
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:31,848
You met Margaret on the train
and went home wearing her coat.

453
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:36,008
I was cold. She gave it me.
Oh, I find that hard to believe.

454
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:37,968
If you knew her...

455
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,528
She was a proper lady.

456
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:42,328
You followed her onto the train -
Margaret, your friend.

457
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:44,568
You had this stupid fight...
No.

458
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:46,713
You were as high as a kite,
your head full of

459
00:30:46,738 --> 00:30:48,989
that white powder
you had in your pocket.

460
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:51,608
I never even seen that before.
I don't know what that is.

461
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:54,648
So you couldn't be held to account because
you didn't know what you were doing.

462
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:56,489
She gave me her coat.

463
00:30:57,969 --> 00:31:00,129
She was always looking out for folk.

464
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:04,849
OK, she gave you the coat. Then what?

465
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:08,729
She got out.
Where?

466
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:11,209
Mountbank?

467
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:14,728
No. She was still on the train.

468
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:17,568
Kenny. Get her a sandwich, will you?

469
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:19,769
What?

470
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:23,929
Oh, hello love.

471
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,009
No, that's all right. I'll come over.

472
00:32:11,449 --> 00:32:14,128
Sorry about the din. It's my son.

473
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:16,649
His way of working things through, I
guess.

474
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:20,608
You had something for me?
Yes.

475
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:23,569
This came and it looked
semi-official.

476
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:27,369
And you thought of me. Thanks.

477
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:30,209
And we're moving on.

478
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:33,808
With Stuart?
Yes. Yeah.

479
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:35,928
Closer to town. For the kids.
Ah.

480
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:39,369
Mm-hm. New school. Better group
of friends, hopefully.

481
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:43,489
With all this going on...
Well, something snapped.

482
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:47,968
We'll need somebody to manage this place,
but I'll be glad to see the back of it.

483
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:50,129
Never really felt like mine.

484
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:52,928
She kept us here, I suppose.
Margaret?

485
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,368
Mm. She never would have moved.

486
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:57,529
Too many memories.

487
00:32:58,129 --> 00:33:01,088
If you've got time,
I could show you something.

488
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:02,329
Yeah.

489
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:08,248
I was clearing out some drawers...

490
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:11,088
and I came across... this.

491
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,329
Stuart said not to bother you with
it.

492
00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:16,488
When was this?

493
00:33:16,489 --> 00:33:18,489
Mid '80s, I reckon.

494
00:33:27,449 --> 00:33:28,768
Well, well.

495
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:30,768
Margaret. Stunning, isn't she?

496
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:32,169
Mm.

497
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:35,569
Look. Do you recognise him?

498
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:38,688
Oh, it's the boat man.
That's right.

499
00:33:38,689 --> 00:33:40,209
Malcolm Kenrich.

500
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:43,448
And who's this?

501
00:33:43,449 --> 00:33:46,329
Uh... Val Furlow. She used to run the
Schooner. The pub.

502
00:33:47,969 --> 00:33:50,089
And Margaret's husband, Pavel?

503
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:54,049
He was off the scene by then.
So who's this?

504
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:57,088
I think that must be Ricky Furlow.

505
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:58,648
He used to help his mum at the pub.

506
00:33:58,649 --> 00:33:59,849
Thanks.

507
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:03,329
Kate...

508
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:08,448
I heard your CD on the way over...

509
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:10,168
Oh, yes?
Oh, it's uh...

510
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:12,489
I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry but...

511
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:15,649
..there's a song on it...

512
00:34:16,209 --> 00:34:18,688
"God help this house..."
"..the mood he's in."

513
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:19,928
Aye.

514
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,969
I didn't have the best of marriages.

515
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:25,888
He hit you?

516
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:28,449
Well... He didn't like me singing in
the band.

517
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:31,289
Or independence of any kind, really.

518
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:34,648
I never stood up to him.

519
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:37,009
My "invisible wall" Margaret calls
it...

520
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:39,968
Called it.

521
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:41,968
Anyway, he's dead now.

522
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:44,048
He died on the rigs.

523
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:45,688
Ryan was six, Chloe four.

524
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:47,248
Oh.

525
00:34:47,249 --> 00:34:51,249
I don't think I would have picked up
the guitar again if it wasn't for Stuart.

526
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,688
Sorry. How did we get onto this?

527
00:34:53,689 --> 00:34:56,528
Oh, no. No, I just wondered...

528
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:58,809
I mean, you look at Margaret...

529
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:01,288
..the world at her feet,

530
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:05,129
and she spends her whole life here in
Mardle.

531
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:08,888
Devoted her life to her flock.

532
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:11,488
Yeah. Strange, isn't it?

533
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:13,008
Mm.

534
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:14,928
Memories, I suppose.

535
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:16,969
Was that your connection?

536
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:22,689
Was she... "knocked about" by her
husband, as it were?

537
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:28,528
She came into the station
the day she died.

538
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:30,648
Really?
Mm.

539
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:33,768
Missed her appointment, though.
Oh.

540
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:37,609
And I just wondered,
maybe she confided in you.

541
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:42,248
We've not been able to trace the husband.
There's no record of them being divorced.

542
00:35:42,249 --> 00:35:45,209
It's a puzzle.
Well, she was a very private person.

543
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:47,809
"Cold War spy."
Yes.

544
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:52,449
Ah, come on. Help me here.

545
00:35:56,169 --> 00:35:59,648
She hated him. Pavel. She hated him.

546
00:35:59,649 --> 00:36:02,208
He was abusive?
Yes.

547
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:04,409
Physically abusive?
Yes.

548
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:10,969
I wonder what happened to him.
May I borrow this?

549
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:15,728
Forensics drew a blank
in Dee Sinton's flat.

550
00:36:15,729 --> 00:36:19,048
No blood spatter on the clothes.
Nothing to link her with a knife attack.

551
00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:22,368
What about the coat?
No blood spatter. No puncture wound.

552
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:24,408
It's not even torn.

553
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:27,849
So, do we charge her? We can get her
with the possession?

554
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:31,208
Ma'am?

555
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:32,609
Let her go.

556
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:38,568
What about the ex-husband, Pavel?
I want him found, priority.

557
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:40,528
Aye, we're looking into that.

558
00:36:40,529 --> 00:36:42,888
There's no Pavel Kraszewski in the
region.

559
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:45,248
We could broaden the search, if you
like.

560
00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:46,768
Yes, I like.

561
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:49,448
He was violent to her. Do you
understand?

562
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:51,969
Someone must know where he is.

563
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:03,049
Dee?

564
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:01,289
It's me, love.

565
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:12,409
Oh...

566
00:39:23,922 --> 00:39:27,482
It's a simple enough question.
Did she fall or was she pushed?

567
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:32,082
Definitely one of the two.

568
00:39:33,642 --> 00:39:35,841
Kenny?
No witnesses.

569
00:39:35,842 --> 00:39:38,001
Not yet.

570
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:40,681
If she was pushed, you would have
seen him, surely.

571
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:42,961
No, I was too late.

572
00:39:42,962 --> 00:39:45,242
She was dead before I got here.

573
00:39:56,802 --> 00:39:59,321
Any prints on the cash?
On the twenties?

574
00:39:59,322 --> 00:40:01,321
Yeah, in the bedsit.
Er, Joe.

575
00:40:01,322 --> 00:40:03,681
There's plenty. We're looking for
matches now.

576
00:40:03,682 --> 00:40:05,841
How much was there?
60 quid.

577
00:40:05,842 --> 00:40:08,841
So with 37 from the off-licence
receipt,

578
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:10,521
that's nigh on 100 quid.

579
00:40:10,522 --> 00:40:12,241
So?

580
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:15,721
You do know how she made her living,
that woman? Mm?

581
00:40:15,722 --> 00:40:18,881
Ten quid, five quid a go,
one drink at a time.

582
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:21,601
So how come she's got 100? Hm?

583
00:40:21,602 --> 00:40:23,642
Who gave her that money?

584
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:28,481
Should have charged her with
possession.

585
00:40:28,482 --> 00:40:31,522
Then she wouldn't be stuck here
with a pin through her, would she?

586
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:41,281
So what happens now?
Low profile.

587
00:40:41,282 --> 00:40:45,922
With any luck, she'll eat her own fist, and
that'll leave us free to get on with our day.

588
00:40:48,002 --> 00:40:51,482
Ma'am?
What did you just call me?

589
00:40:52,762 --> 00:40:54,401
No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

590
00:40:54,402 --> 00:40:56,642
"Ma'am"? God in heaven, Joe.

591
00:40:57,482 --> 00:40:59,321
Look, things are just a bit mental
here.

592
00:40:59,322 --> 00:41:01,001
Time, Joe.

593
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:03,881
Oh, shit.
I've got our daughter with me.

594
00:41:03,882 --> 00:41:07,841
We're ready for her appointment
with a counsellor and you're not here.

595
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:10,042
Will you put her on?
See ya.

596
00:41:18,802 --> 00:41:20,721
Come on, love.

597
00:41:20,722 --> 00:41:23,442
Where's dad?
He'll catch us up.

598
00:41:25,602 --> 00:41:28,761
This wasn't just some charity case.

599
00:41:28,762 --> 00:41:32,202
This was a real friendship
going back 30 years.

600
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:35,202
I mean, Dee. Look at her.

601
00:41:36,562 --> 00:41:39,162
She looks like
she's on her way to Sunday school.

602
00:41:39,842 --> 00:41:42,362
So how did that...

603
00:41:43,082 --> 00:41:44,762
..turn into this, hm?

604
00:41:48,082 --> 00:41:49,762
Look...

605
00:41:50,522 --> 00:41:52,602
What?
I gotta go.

606
00:41:53,482 --> 00:41:54,721
OK.

607
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,921
What? Simple as that? No catch?

608
00:41:56,922 --> 00:41:58,722
What am I, a bully?

609
00:42:04,642 --> 00:42:08,482
Hey, you can dump it all on me
if it makes you feel any better.

610
00:42:09,282 --> 00:42:13,081
But, end of the day,
it's not me keeps you here.

611
00:42:13,082 --> 00:42:15,202
You're here cos you want to be.

612
00:42:39,762 --> 00:42:43,441
Half the stuff he had up here - I
can't tell you.

613
00:42:43,442 --> 00:42:46,321
I've bagged it up with the toxic
waste.

614
00:42:46,322 --> 00:42:49,241
Autopsy. Come on. I've got to get
going.

615
00:42:49,242 --> 00:42:51,441
I'm moving all my stuff in.

616
00:42:51,442 --> 00:42:53,082
My predecessor...

617
00:42:54,122 --> 00:42:55,842
Sit down, please.

618
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:59,841
Well, he was one hell of a guy.

619
00:42:59,842 --> 00:43:02,121
What was he? A boy racer type?

620
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:04,121
Who, Billy?

621
00:43:04,122 --> 00:43:06,561
Old man with delusions of Steve
McQueen.

622
00:43:06,562 --> 00:43:09,041
Towering Inferno?
Bullitt.

623
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:10,841
Nice.

624
00:43:10,842 --> 00:43:12,962
So...

625
00:43:15,362 --> 00:43:17,522
Big sip. That's it.

626
00:43:19,122 --> 00:43:21,081
Death by natural causes.

627
00:43:21,082 --> 00:43:23,081
She fell off a roof!

628
00:43:23,082 --> 00:43:26,642
She was on a bender. Tank full of
booze. No sign of any struggle.

629
00:43:27,642 --> 00:43:29,641
Suicide?
Not even.

630
00:43:29,642 --> 00:43:32,881
Massive coronary, victim staggers
off the roof head first,

631
00:43:32,882 --> 00:43:34,962
didn't even try and break her fall.

632
00:43:36,962 --> 00:43:38,761
I'll need a second opinion.

633
00:43:38,762 --> 00:43:40,602
Course you will.

634
00:43:46,762 --> 00:43:48,402
Oh. Thanks.

635
00:43:56,002 --> 00:43:57,521
You not drinking?

636
00:43:57,522 --> 00:43:59,881
I've only got the one mug.

637
00:43:59,882 --> 00:44:02,562
Well, here you go. Go on.

638
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:15,522
I'll be gone in a tick.

639
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:19,762
To your woman.
Mm.

640
00:44:21,122 --> 00:44:22,682
To Dee.

641
00:44:25,482 --> 00:44:28,122
You didn't know her?
Oh, hardly.

642
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,202
She was a lost cause.

643
00:44:32,362 --> 00:44:34,402
I shouldn't really care, should I?

644
00:44:52,882 --> 00:44:54,722
Bloody hooligans.

645
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:27,122
Emily.
Do I know you?

646
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:30,042
Holypool, lemonade.

647
00:45:31,122 --> 00:45:32,881
Who are your mates?

648
00:45:32,882 --> 00:45:34,721
What do you care?
You're not my mother.

649
00:45:34,722 --> 00:45:37,281
Hey, that's enough of that.
I'm sick of people!

650
00:45:37,282 --> 00:45:39,361
I'm sick of people trying to run my
life.

651
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,641
Calm down, love. Here you are. Eat.

652
00:45:41,642 --> 00:45:44,521
No chance. I'm on a diet.
Oh.

653
00:45:44,522 --> 00:45:48,561
Good for you. No, it's good to look
after your figure. It's very nice.

654
00:45:48,562 --> 00:45:50,361
Ta.

655
00:45:50,362 --> 00:45:52,601
Anyway, who'd want to run your life?

656
00:45:52,602 --> 00:45:54,522
Need their head looking at.

657
00:45:56,802 --> 00:45:59,721
Oh. Lady up at Holypool?

658
00:45:59,722 --> 00:46:02,001
Jane.
Mm.

659
00:46:02,002 --> 00:46:05,281
Aye. Her and... that...

660
00:46:05,282 --> 00:46:07,442
Who? Margaret?

661
00:46:08,362 --> 00:46:11,121
Didn't we think much of her?
No, we didn't.

662
00:46:11,122 --> 00:46:13,361
Ah, never trust a do-gooder, eh?

663
00:46:13,362 --> 00:46:16,081
Always making people do stuff and...

664
00:46:16,082 --> 00:46:17,562
What stuff?

665
00:46:18,802 --> 00:46:20,922
Nothing.

666
00:46:21,602 --> 00:46:23,161
What stuff?

667
00:46:23,162 --> 00:46:26,962
You know... You trust them, you open
up to them.

668
00:46:27,722 --> 00:46:29,721
In the end, they just use you.

669
00:46:29,722 --> 00:46:32,242
There are people you can trust.

670
00:46:39,522 --> 00:46:41,921
You want me to come in with you?

671
00:46:41,922 --> 00:46:43,801
No, I don't need you!

672
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:47,442
Hey, if you need my help, love.
Boy trouble. Thanks very much.

673
00:46:50,562 --> 00:46:51,961
Shep?

674
00:46:51,962 --> 00:46:55,121
Ma'am... that invoice from Margaret's
solicitor.

675
00:46:55,122 --> 00:46:57,721
I've gotten hold of him.
And?

676
00:46:57,722 --> 00:47:00,362
And she made a will.

677
00:47:02,602 --> 00:47:06,162
She had 50,000 saved.
50,000?

678
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:09,081
What was that? Family money?
No.

679
00:47:09,082 --> 00:47:12,161
The family had nothing to do with
her after she married her husband.

680
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,761
No, I got the impression she saved
it up.

681
00:47:14,762 --> 00:47:17,201
She did some book-keeping, I think
she said?

682
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:18,721
Course.

683
00:47:18,722 --> 00:47:21,961
So, 10,000 to her friend, Kate
Darrow.

684
00:47:21,962 --> 00:47:25,202
"An investment in musical talent."

685
00:47:26,642 --> 00:47:29,081
Nothing for the kids? Chloe and Ryan?

686
00:47:29,082 --> 00:47:31,521
No. She didn't mention them. Why?

687
00:47:31,522 --> 00:47:34,481
No reason. Go on.

688
00:47:34,482 --> 00:47:36,681
Ten more to Holypool House.

689
00:47:36,682 --> 00:47:39,361
The...
The charity. Yeah, I know.

690
00:47:39,362 --> 00:47:43,122
And 30,000 to a Deirdre Sinton.

691
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:45,642
Dee?

692
00:47:51,882 --> 00:47:56,842
"To Deidre Sinton... a friend I once
hurt."

693
00:47:57,642 --> 00:48:00,802
I was hoping you could tell me, to
be honest.

694
00:48:02,162 --> 00:48:05,161
The money was to be handled by a
third party,

695
00:48:05,162 --> 00:48:07,801
to administer funds on behalf, and
to...

696
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:10,681
.. "do what he can to assist her."

697
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:12,521
So who was the third party?

698
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,641
Next para down.

699
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,722
Malcolm Kenrich.

700
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,682
Ryan? Where's Malcolm?

701
00:48:27,602 --> 00:48:29,922
He's gone to the island.

702
00:48:31,602 --> 00:48:34,041
Shouldn't you be at school?
What's it to you?

703
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:36,202
Oh, nothing at all, pet. You carry
on.

704
00:48:36,922 --> 00:48:39,002
Well, I'm not waiting.

705
00:48:57,642 --> 00:48:59,722
Hello, there!

706
00:49:09,842 --> 00:49:11,601
Have you got a minute?

707
00:49:11,602 --> 00:49:13,442
Oh, Christ.

708
00:49:28,482 --> 00:49:31,961
Margaret said once,
could I keep an eye on Dee.

709
00:49:31,962 --> 00:49:34,161
And that's it.

710
00:49:34,162 --> 00:49:36,242
Well, you're in her will.

711
00:49:37,562 --> 00:49:39,642
News to me.

712
00:49:40,442 --> 00:49:42,722
You should get back.
Tide's going out.

713
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:47,682
Did you know she was ill at all?

714
00:49:48,802 --> 00:49:50,882
No. I hardly knew her. I told you.

715
00:49:51,682 --> 00:49:53,841
And Ryan?

716
00:49:53,842 --> 00:49:56,321
She asked you to keep an eye on him
an' all?

717
00:49:56,322 --> 00:49:58,482
No, no, man. That was Kate. His mam.

718
00:49:59,402 --> 00:50:00,681
Why?

719
00:50:00,682 --> 00:50:02,961
Steady him, I suppose.

720
00:50:02,962 --> 00:50:04,681
Boy's without a father.

721
00:50:04,682 --> 00:50:07,082
I do what I can.
Try to keep him occupied.

722
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:13,162
Wait here.

723
00:50:45,802 --> 00:50:48,481
Margaret's murder, Thursday
night.

724
00:50:48,482 --> 00:50:51,961
I was out and about.
Up the estuary, working.

725
00:50:51,962 --> 00:50:54,442
Fishing bait?
Logan. Aye.

726
00:50:55,242 --> 00:50:57,681
50,000 that woman had salted away.

727
00:50:57,682 --> 00:50:59,321
Where from? Do you know?

728
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:02,321
No idea. Like I say, I hardly...
Hardly knew her.

729
00:51:02,322 --> 00:51:07,202
Yet here you are, the pair of you,
30 years ago.

730
00:51:09,162 --> 00:51:11,121
Where'd you get this?

731
00:51:11,122 --> 00:51:12,321
And Dee?

732
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:14,681
Look, she's there an' all.
Mm.

733
00:51:14,682 --> 00:51:17,041
Shy thing.

734
00:51:17,042 --> 00:51:19,202
I should've...

735
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:21,682
I should've kept a better eye on
her. Mm.

736
00:51:22,682 --> 00:51:25,602
What's her story, Malcolm?
What happened to her?

737
00:51:28,482 --> 00:51:30,521
I'll tell you one thing.

738
00:51:30,522 --> 00:51:32,681
That black eye she had.

739
00:51:32,682 --> 00:51:35,521
She didn't walk into any old
lamppost, did she?

740
00:51:35,522 --> 00:51:37,482
What, someone gave her a slap? Who?

741
00:51:39,242 --> 00:51:41,161
I saw her getting out of a car.

742
00:51:41,162 --> 00:51:43,441
Whose car?

743
00:51:43,442 --> 00:51:47,082
# Happy birthday to you

744
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:51,242
# Happy birthday to you

745
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:56,082
# Happy birthday, dear George

746
00:51:56,562 --> 00:52:00,962
# Happy birthday to you

747
00:52:17,842 --> 00:52:20,122
Come on, birthday boy.

748
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,719
Dee Sinton. I swear. I didn't kill her.
I swear. I swear.

749
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,639
And I'm supposed to take you at your
word?

750
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,039
I mean, the last time I saw you,
you told us you were... What was it?

751
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,239
Home. Norwich, wasn't it?

752
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,399
Northants. I did...

753
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,919
I set off...

754
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,319
I called Sandra at Wetherby -
the motorway stop.

755
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,559
She said, "Don't come home.
I don't want to see you.

756
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,720
I'm moving out, you see."

757
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,640
12 years. Now this.

758
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,119
So I turn the car round.
I'm back into town by tea.

759
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,159
Where you bump into Dee Sinton.

760
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,200
"Buy us a drink." It was oddly reassuring
to see someone in a worse pickle.

761
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,720
So why do you hit her, George?

762
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,399
No.
Yes.

763
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,079
I was just trying to do a good deed,
just trying to get her home in one piece.

764
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,679
My God, I had no designs on that
creature. As I told her.

765
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,319
At which point, she became pretty
abusive.

766
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,520
And?

767
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,120
I may have struck out in
self-defence.

768
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,040
And the next day?

769
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,120
Mm? Come on.

770
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,320
You gave her £100.

771
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,959
Your prints are all over the money,
George.

772
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,360
Well, I...

773
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,439
I didn't want a misunderstanding
being blown out of proportion.

774
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,439
Oh, hush money?

775
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,959
Like in one of your spy novels?

776
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,720
Ma'am.

777
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,359
Ah, here we are.

778
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,319
£100 drawn from a cash machine...

779
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,959
eight minutes past four, yesterday
afternoon.

780
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,240
She went straight down the off
licence...

781
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,159
..drank 40 quid's worth of booze...
heart went pop.

782
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,480
Now she'd dead.

783
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,400
I feel sick again.

784
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,400
Stick him in the cells.
Charge him with assault.

785
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,479
And check his alibi for the night of
Margaret's death.

786
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,759
Will do, ma'am.

787
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,840
Look at them.

788
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,960
Old friends.

789
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,000
"A friend I once hurt."

790
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,280
Ma'am.

791
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,519
Ma'am?

792
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,840
Valerie Furlow. The old landlady at
the Schooner Inn.

793
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,639
Still living, apparently.

794
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,280
Address?
Yep.

795
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,919
I don't see. It's some old
photograph. What does it prove?

796
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,239
Go on, spit it out.

797
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,639
But Dee Sinton's got no bearing on
the murder.

798
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,679
She was a drunk with a bad heart.
So what?

799
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,800
Oh, come on. Ring the buzzer.

800
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,759
Valerie Furlow?
Where is she?

801
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,959
The what, love?
The nurse.

802
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,719
Always late.

803
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,640
Sour black lass.

804
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,399
No, I'm DCI Vera Stanhope, love.

805
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,359
This is DS Ashworth.

806
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,719
Now, you used to run the Schooner
Inn. Here you are.

807
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,480
This here your son?
Ricky.

808
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,679
So where's Ricky now?

809
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,080
Looking right at you.

810
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,880
Oh, OK.

811
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,160
So where is he now?

812
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,440
We lost touch.

813
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,079
Margaret Kraszewski? Remember her?

814
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,119
Oh, much admired.

815
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,400
She liked that.

816
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,040
I hear she turned into Mother
Teresa.

817
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,880
Well, somebody's got to do it.

818
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,079
And her pet mouse.

819
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,679
Ah, well, that's Dee Sinton.

820
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,639
You'd have known her back in the day.

821
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,919
Hardly.

822
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,919
She and Margaret friends?
And neighbours.

823
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,839
What? She used to live on Harbour
Street, near Margaret?

824
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:05,759
Yeah, she had digs in the same
house, on the ground floor.

825
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,360
She was on a typing course.
Somewhere in town, I think it were.

826
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,680
What happened to Dee?

827
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,520
Did she get hurt in some way?

828
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,240
Because of Margaret?

829
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,080
It was all long ago.

830
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,080
Why, what's wrong?

831
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,680
Margaret has been murdered.

832
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,519
She had a husband we're trying to
locate.

833
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,759
Polish.

834
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,680
Mm. Pavel.

835
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,879
I heard he used to knock her about a
bit.

836
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,999
Did he?

837
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,160
Well, these foreign fellas...

838
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,080
Know where I might find him?

839
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,720
Cleared off, I expect, like half
this town.

840
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,080
Thanks, love.

841
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,079
Oh.

842
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,320
This photo.

843
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,200
Who took it? Do you remember?

844
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,520
Young lad. Big curly locks.

845
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,600
One of Margaret's callers, you might
say.

846
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,879
A name?

847
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,959
Musician fella. Had a great big
double bass.

848
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,480
Big as a bloody coffin.

849
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,799
Margaret.

850
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,040
You first met her... when?

851
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,079
Stuart?

852
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,159
Ah, she worked as a... She was...

853
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,120
A prostitute?
Well, that's not a word I would use.

854
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,520
She had a small group of people
who she saw.

855
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,879
Look, I know how that sounds,
out loud, as it were...

856
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,839
Yeah, but you used to visit her... as
it were?

857
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,119
Yes.

858
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,440
Up in... the same room...

859
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,639
Marianne.

860
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:54,159
What?
That was her little joke.

861
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,160
Her working name.

862
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:01,039
Mrs T was in Downing Street,
so "Margaret" was off-limits.

863
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,559
So we called her Marianne.

864
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,759
Anyhow, six months rolled by
and the visits ended.

865
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,119
And then, God, years later, I met
Kate.

866
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,519
And then she said she lived out in
Mardle.

867
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,079
I had no idea Margaret would still
be here.

868
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,399
And Margaret never let on?
No. No, she wouldn't!

869
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,880
Kate would've been destroyed.

870
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,199
You're not gonna tell her?

871
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,880
No. Best coming from you, pet.

872
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,879
A sex worker? Aw, bless, he's all
shocked, aren't you, pet?

873
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,799
At least we know how she saved the
50,000.

874
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,359
There's no way that's why
she was going to the police?

875
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,359
Get her past out in the open before
she died?

876
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,639
The way I see it is we've got
a real link here, haven't we?

877
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,359
Oh, have we?
Well, they were both tarts, weren't they?

878
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:50,119
Oh, so suddenly there's
a woman-hater on the loose?

879
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,919
A killer of prostitutes.

880
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,479
Jack the Ripper... slummin' it in
Mardle.

881
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,480
Anyway, isn't it you lot keep
reminding me Dee died of a heart attack?

882
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,000
OK. Stuart. Mm?

883
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,919
Night of Margaret's death, where was
he?

884
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,519
He was working late at the school.

885
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,440
He drove Kate home from the city
about 8:30.

886
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,600
Play that again.

887
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,080
Look at her.

888
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,879
What if...

889
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,079
Is it possible...

890
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,239
she could already be dead?

891
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,320
What? I mean, look at her?

892
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,680
If she's...

893
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,999
Oh, God, if she's dead sat there...
She wasn't stabbed at Partlington.

894
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,479
No, stabbed before.

895
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,319
Dee said Margaret got off the train.

896
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,600
But what if she just switched
carriages?

897
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,719
She gets on my carriage...
Yeah, having already been stabbed.

898
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,759
What was it the pathologist said?
She'd hardly feel it.

899
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,599
Right, so in goes the knife...

900
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,759
Hm?

901
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,079
..her legs start to go from under
her...

902
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,080
stranger gives up his seat...

903
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,599
..she sits down and the train goes
on.

904
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,880
Look.

905
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,519
Jess said she looked at her.

906
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,960
She was dying, wasn't she?

907
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,840
Rebecca Shepherd.
Get yourself home, Joe. Go on.

908
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,799
Where are you going?

909
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,960
Right, next question, Kenny.

910
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,040
Why did she switch carriages?

911
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,279
It was crowded?

912
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,160
Or she saw somebody?

913
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,559
She was being followed?

914
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,959
Ma'am. Margaret's husband.
Pavel Kraszewski.

915
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,560
What? On the phone?
Uh... not quite.

916
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,439
This is DCI Stanhope.

917
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,159
This is Pavel's brother, Mr
Walter... Valta. Valta Kraszewski.

918
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,680
Well, thanks for your help, Valta.

919
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:14,039
So, you filed a missing persons report
for your brother Pavel in March 2008?

920
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,799
Correct.

921
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,799
I promised my mother after I come to
England, I make enquiries,

922
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,800
so I make this report.

923
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:27,039
And?
Nothing. No news.

924
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,839
So when was the last time
your family heard from Pavel?

925
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,240
Not since '85.

926
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,799
We get... We get postcard.

927
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,039
Here.

928
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:42,719
He says he is married to
a beautiful English girl... family is rich.

929
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,359
We never hear from him again.

930
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,079
Was that typical?

931
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,960
No. He would always ring once a
year, on my mother's birthday.

932
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,600
After '85, he stopped calling.

933
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:03,160
So... you gonna find him... or not?

934
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,960
Was he a violent man, would you say,
your brother?

935
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,239
How should I know?

936
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,040
Ask his wife.

937
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,119
We'll find him.

938
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,719
No, he's missing.

939
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,760
He used to beat up his wife
and then he goes missing.

940
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,839
So you think Margaret kills her husband
and dumps the body, all on her tod?

941
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,439
This is based on what?

942
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,560
Maybe she had help.

943
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,599
'And can I ask, what's the nature
of the appointment?'

944
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,679
'I... I can't say over the phone.'

945
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,519
'It's just it would help if you need to
talk to anyone with the right experience.'

946
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,800
'Oh, if we could just sit down, I
think, go through our options...'

947
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,560
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

948
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,240
I've got you.

949
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,959
'Marianne.'
'What?'

950
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,559
'That was our little joke, her
working name.'

951
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,680
Marianne!

952
01:06:29,562 --> 01:06:31,762
Oh, Mr Kenrich!

953
01:06:33,642 --> 01:06:36,601
Your relationship with that woman...
With Margaret?

954
01:06:36,602 --> 01:06:38,681
No, not Margaret.

955
01:06:38,682 --> 01:06:40,601
Marianne.

956
01:06:40,602 --> 01:06:43,281
Mary Ann. You named your boat after
her.

957
01:06:43,282 --> 01:06:46,162
The woman you hardly knew.
She was a beauty.

958
01:06:46,882 --> 01:06:49,081
You two...?
We were better than that.

959
01:06:49,082 --> 01:06:51,281
She was the love of my life.
OK.

960
01:06:51,282 --> 01:06:55,281
I'd have swum naked round Spence
Island if she'd have asked me to.

961
01:06:55,282 --> 01:06:58,882
You go ahead, pet, if the spirit
moves you.

962
01:06:59,722 --> 01:07:02,841
Eh, you were so keen
to get me off the island, weren't you?

963
01:07:02,842 --> 01:07:05,241
Is that where he is?
Who?

964
01:07:05,242 --> 01:07:07,121
Pavel.

965
01:07:07,122 --> 01:07:10,241
Pavel? I told you, I hardly knew the
fella.

966
01:07:10,242 --> 01:07:11,921
Oh, well, suit yourself.

967
01:07:11,922 --> 01:07:13,841
The boat's on its way.

968
01:07:13,842 --> 01:07:17,161
Kenny, stay with Mr Kenrich.
Keep him warm till we need him.

969
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:18,722
Ma'am.

970
01:07:19,722 --> 01:07:21,761
Oh...

971
01:07:21,762 --> 01:07:23,801
I've been meaning to ask you.

972
01:07:23,802 --> 01:07:26,402
Did you ever... way back in the day,

973
01:07:27,602 --> 01:07:29,602
take a poacher over to the island...

974
01:07:30,282 --> 01:07:32,921
..looking for birds' eggs - terns,
most likely?

975
01:07:32,922 --> 01:07:34,921
A poacher?
Mm.

976
01:07:34,922 --> 01:07:36,042
Hector.

977
01:07:37,082 --> 01:07:39,361
Stanhope.
Mm.

978
01:07:39,362 --> 01:07:41,602
You're Hector's lass, aren't you?

979
01:08:08,162 --> 01:08:09,801
That was quick.

980
01:08:09,802 --> 01:08:13,081
They're all moving in together.
Something "snapped", apparently.

981
01:08:13,082 --> 01:08:15,401
He hasn't told her yet, has he?
About Margaret?

982
01:08:15,402 --> 01:08:17,362
Shh. Keep your voice down.
He can hear you.

983
01:08:23,882 --> 01:08:26,962
Look, I know you're sore about
moving, but... it'll be fun.

984
01:08:28,602 --> 01:08:30,081
Ryan!

985
01:08:30,082 --> 01:08:31,402
Ry!

986
01:08:38,922 --> 01:08:40,481
Hi.
You want a hand?

987
01:08:40,482 --> 01:08:41,962
No.

988
01:08:44,522 --> 01:08:46,121
What was all that about Hector?

989
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:52,281
Oh, aeons ago, me and me dad
came out here one night, in a boat.

990
01:08:52,282 --> 01:08:56,402
This wildlife officer followed us,
trying to catch him in the act.

991
01:08:57,362 --> 01:09:00,362
Not that Hector cared.
Thrill of the chase, you see.

992
01:09:02,002 --> 01:09:04,681
How old were you?
Oh... Seven?

993
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,641
Eight?

994
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,801
He fell out of a tree.

995
01:09:08,802 --> 01:09:10,841
Who did?

996
01:09:10,842 --> 01:09:12,842
The old man.

997
01:09:14,002 --> 01:09:15,842
Head for the chapel.

998
01:09:17,962 --> 01:09:20,282
We need to search in the chapel.

999
01:09:23,762 --> 01:09:25,842
Margaret?

1000
01:09:29,882 --> 01:09:31,682
Here?

1001
01:09:35,282 --> 01:09:37,362
Kate, I'm so sorry.

1002
01:09:41,122 --> 01:09:43,122
Say something.

1003
01:09:59,242 --> 01:10:01,601
We had a fight.

1004
01:10:01,602 --> 01:10:03,641
Yeah?

1005
01:10:03,642 --> 01:10:05,642
Who's that, mate?

1006
01:10:07,442 --> 01:10:10,082
I don't know me own strength.
That's the trouble.

1007
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:13,082
Still... No regrets.

1008
01:10:14,362 --> 01:10:16,842
He was a bad man.

1009
01:10:19,082 --> 01:10:21,042
He wanted her.

1010
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:24,201
Thought he knew what she needed.

1011
01:10:24,202 --> 01:10:26,562
Fella like him, no chance.

1012
01:10:28,482 --> 01:10:30,682
Who? Her husband?

1013
01:10:31,642 --> 01:10:35,122
Freedom - that's all she ever
wanted.

1014
01:10:36,202 --> 01:10:37,722
He hated that.

1015
01:10:39,122 --> 01:10:41,562
He kept on trying to break her.

1016
01:10:42,882 --> 01:10:44,841
In the end...

1017
01:10:44,842 --> 01:10:47,042
he broke her friend instead, didn't
he?

1018
01:10:48,442 --> 01:10:51,002
Her "pet mouse". Dee.

1019
01:10:55,122 --> 01:10:57,282
He hurt her.

1020
01:10:58,482 --> 01:11:00,722
This man, he... raped her?

1021
01:11:01,362 --> 01:11:03,441
Aye.

1022
01:11:03,442 --> 01:11:07,042
And, Dee, well...
she was never right after that.

1023
01:11:19,682 --> 01:11:21,242
And Margaret...

1024
01:11:21,922 --> 01:11:24,162
..she blames herself.

1025
01:11:25,162 --> 01:11:27,161
"Tell him.

1026
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:33,522
Tell that man to leave us alone."
That's what she said.

1027
01:11:37,162 --> 01:11:39,641
It's the station. Hello?

1028
01:11:39,642 --> 01:11:41,482
Tell the boss we traced him.

1029
01:11:42,202 --> 01:11:43,841
No, we just dug him up.

1030
01:11:43,842 --> 01:11:46,281
We traced Pavel Kraszewski.

1031
01:11:46,282 --> 01:11:48,681
What's that?
Margaret's husband.

1032
01:11:48,682 --> 01:11:50,121
Listen, Joe.

1033
01:11:50,122 --> 01:11:52,202
I just spoke to him five minutes
ago.

1034
01:12:01,922 --> 01:12:03,722
This knife... Where'd you get it?

1035
01:12:05,922 --> 01:12:08,322
I'll ask the questions. Sit down.

1036
01:12:09,842 --> 01:12:11,441
Is that what killed her?

1037
01:12:11,442 --> 01:12:13,042
Sit down!

1038
01:12:13,922 --> 01:12:16,401
Hey, I said sit down.

1039
01:12:16,402 --> 01:12:18,922
Aargh!

1040
01:12:57,870 --> 01:13:00,810
Pavel Kaszewski. It's the same man.

1041
01:13:00,819 --> 01:13:02,858
Same birth date. Same place.

1042
01:13:02,859 --> 01:13:06,778
He went to Canada to get remarried and
never divorced his first wife, Margaret.

1043
01:13:06,779 --> 01:13:08,298
Two wives.

1044
01:13:08,299 --> 01:13:11,339
No wonder he wasn't exactly busting
to get in touch.

1045
01:13:12,379 --> 01:13:14,298
When did he leave Mardle?

1046
01:13:14,299 --> 01:13:15,818
October '84.

1047
01:13:15,819 --> 01:13:18,659
So when this was taken...

1048
01:13:19,899 --> 01:13:21,379
..he was long gone.

1049
01:13:22,979 --> 01:13:26,459
So who did we just dig up,
if that's not Pavel Kraszewski?

1050
01:13:28,219 --> 01:13:30,419
So where's Ricky now?

1051
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:36,978
Get hold of Kenny.
I just tried him.

1052
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:39,178
Well, try harder.

1053
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:41,578
What's he...?

1054
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:43,499
The pick-up's gone.

1055
01:13:45,979 --> 01:13:47,379
Come on!

1056
01:13:48,099 --> 01:13:50,219
Kenny?

1057
01:13:51,699 --> 01:13:53,219
Kenny?

1058
01:13:55,019 --> 01:13:57,139
Oh, please, no!

1059
01:14:02,819 --> 01:14:06,979
I want DC Lockhart found,
and I want him found now!

1060
01:14:09,259 --> 01:14:11,019
Kenny!

1061
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:18,739
Kenny!
Police!

1062
01:14:19,779 --> 01:14:22,539
Is there anyone there?
Police. Open up.

1063
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:43,858
It's all right, son. I'm looking for
my mate. Only, he's hurt.

1064
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:45,938
He's got grey hair. Have you seen
him?

1065
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:47,499
I gave him his tea.

1066
01:14:51,139 --> 01:14:52,819
Joe.

1067
01:14:56,219 --> 01:14:58,298
Kenny. Kenny.

1068
01:14:58,299 --> 01:14:59,978
Paramedic!

1069
01:14:59,979 --> 01:15:01,738
Kenny, love, wake up.

1070
01:15:01,739 --> 01:15:04,098
Kenny, I need you to wake up!

1071
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:06,019
It's Vera.

1072
01:15:08,059 --> 01:15:10,858
It's all right, love.
You're going to be all right.

1073
01:15:10,859 --> 01:15:13,698
But, Kenny, I need you to stay awake.

1074
01:15:13,699 --> 01:15:16,579
Talk to me, Kenny. Come on. Talk to
me.

1075
01:15:18,019 --> 01:15:19,698
The knife...

1076
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:21,578
The knife?

1077
01:15:21,579 --> 01:15:23,938
It was his?
No.

1078
01:15:23,939 --> 01:15:27,378
No... But he recognised it?
Stay awake, Kenny.

1079
01:15:27,379 --> 01:15:30,939
He knew whose knife it was?
Yes.

1080
01:15:44,979 --> 01:15:47,539
Get in the car.

1081
01:15:48,259 --> 01:15:53,378
So Malcolm Kenrich killed a man
for Margaret, she went to the police
to confess to his murder?

1082
01:15:53,379 --> 01:15:56,858
What, and he kills her
to stop her from telling the truth?

1083
01:15:56,859 --> 01:15:58,419
Ma'am.

1084
01:15:59,419 --> 01:16:01,218
What? You squeamish?

1085
01:16:01,219 --> 01:16:03,458
Here. Get over to Val Furlow.

1086
01:16:03,459 --> 01:16:07,738
See if we can get a positive ID
on that body on Spence Island.

1087
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:09,739
Hey, where are you going?

1088
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:19,659
Come here, you!
Get off me!

1089
01:16:20,459 --> 01:16:22,699
Hey!

1090
01:16:26,979 --> 01:16:28,859
Come here!

1091
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:32,698
'It's just it would help if you need to
talk to anyone with the right experience.'

1092
01:16:32,699 --> 01:16:36,779
'Oh, if we could just sit down, I
think, go through our options...'

1093
01:16:37,979 --> 01:16:39,938
'..go through our options...'

1094
01:16:39,939 --> 01:16:42,258
Our options?

1095
01:16:42,259 --> 01:16:44,939
'And anything that's said...'
'Will be taken...'

1096
01:16:48,819 --> 01:16:52,698
Ma'am?
Shep, I need a support team.

1097
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:56,058
Are you on your own?
That's right. I've found Malcolm's car.

1098
01:16:56,059 --> 01:16:58,738
Edge of the marshland.
The coast road. I've got it!

1099
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:02,018
And get somebody up to Holypool House
quick as you can!

1100
01:17:02,019 --> 01:17:03,138
Will do.

1101
01:17:03,139 --> 01:17:07,539
So who was with you, Margaret,
when you came into the station?

1102
01:17:25,339 --> 01:17:27,339
Malcolm!

1103
01:17:38,179 --> 01:17:40,219
Come here, you bastard!

1104
01:17:43,139 --> 01:17:45,019
I can see you!

1105
01:17:49,019 --> 01:17:50,098
Oi!

1106
01:17:50,099 --> 01:17:52,379
Malcolm!

1107
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:08,899
Get off me!

1108
01:18:19,819 --> 01:18:21,099
Malcolm!

1109
01:18:25,499 --> 01:18:27,459
No more, Malcolm!

1110
01:18:29,259 --> 01:18:31,459
No more! Enough!

1111
01:18:36,659 --> 01:18:38,019
Malcolm!

1112
01:18:40,419 --> 01:18:42,538
Are you OK, Ryan?

1113
01:18:42,539 --> 01:18:44,539
Ryan?

1114
01:18:46,459 --> 01:18:47,978
She loved you!

1115
01:18:47,979 --> 01:18:50,578
That sad cow never gave a toss
for anyone but herself!

1116
01:18:50,579 --> 01:18:52,938
He killed her. It was his knife.

1117
01:18:52,939 --> 01:18:56,019
Are you mental? Some old biddy?
I wasn't afraid of her.

1118
01:18:56,979 --> 01:18:58,498
What's this?

1119
01:18:58,499 --> 01:19:00,019
Hm?

1120
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:03,298
He's no killer.

1121
01:19:03,299 --> 01:19:05,778
Not yet at any rate.

1122
01:19:05,779 --> 01:19:07,699
Come on.

1123
01:19:26,819 --> 01:19:28,899
I'm sorry. I can't let you touch it.

1124
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:37,698
Is this your son's?

1125
01:19:37,699 --> 01:19:39,339
Ricky's?

1126
01:19:43,619 --> 01:19:45,579
And Ricky wanted to pimp for
Margaret?

1127
01:19:46,859 --> 01:19:48,499
Yeah.

1128
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:56,379
Something about that woman
woke something up in him.

1129
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:01,739
She made him mad,
not like my lad at all.

1130
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:06,779
And one day he just disappeared
off the face of the world.

1131
01:20:09,499 --> 01:20:13,179
I said to myself, "He'll have gone
down south." It was easier that way.

1132
01:20:14,339 --> 01:20:16,379
You didn't report him missing.

1133
01:20:19,539 --> 01:20:22,139
Truth is, it was easier with him
gone.

1134
01:20:28,019 --> 01:20:30,019
Thank you.

1135
01:20:36,899 --> 01:20:42,098
Funny... last Christmas, I thought I
heard him on the step,

1136
01:20:42,099 --> 01:20:44,779
his voice - loud, low, like his
dad's.

1137
01:20:49,939 --> 01:20:53,659
A few grand-kiddies...
That would have been nice.

1138
01:21:10,859 --> 01:21:12,978
No Stuart?

1139
01:21:12,979 --> 01:21:14,779
No. We're having...

1140
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:17,659
It's just me and the kids tonight.

1141
01:21:20,379 --> 01:21:21,859
This.

1142
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:25,578
It's Finn's. Their father.

1143
01:21:25,579 --> 01:21:27,579
Mm.

1144
01:21:28,819 --> 01:21:32,938
So, Malcolm... I expect you'll want
to know why he was after your lad.

1145
01:21:32,939 --> 01:21:35,698
He jumped to the wrong conclusion,
obviously.

1146
01:21:35,699 --> 01:21:39,299
There was a bad man in Mardle,
back in the day.

1147
01:21:40,179 --> 01:21:43,258
You pointed him out to me
in the photograph.

1148
01:21:43,259 --> 01:21:45,219
Ricky Furlow?

1149
01:21:46,099 --> 01:21:50,178
Well, he hurt someone very close to
Margaret.

1150
01:21:50,179 --> 01:21:52,058
Dee. Yes, the rape.

1151
01:21:52,059 --> 01:21:54,779
Oh, Margaret told you?
Yes.

1152
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:58,138
Well, Margaret, you see,

1153
01:21:58,139 --> 01:22:02,138
she was convinced
that history was repeating itself.

1154
01:22:02,139 --> 01:22:05,258
Ryan... Look, he has his weaknesses,
OK?

1155
01:22:05,259 --> 01:22:06,938
He fell in with the wrong crowd.

1156
01:22:06,939 --> 01:22:09,618
He had 200 quid in his pocket,
selling drugs.

1157
01:22:09,619 --> 01:22:11,258
And that's not all, is it?

1158
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:13,818
Really?

1159
01:22:13,819 --> 01:22:18,099
You spinning me that lie
about Margaret's violent husband.

1160
01:22:18,979 --> 01:22:23,338
No, Margaret came to the police
station to tell us about Ryan.

1161
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:25,338
And she wasn't alone, was she?

1162
01:22:25,339 --> 01:22:29,419
"Can we sit down, sort out our
options?"

1163
01:22:30,499 --> 01:22:32,179
Emily.

1164
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:36,659
Margaret said that my son...

1165
01:22:37,459 --> 01:22:39,538
..raped that child.

1166
01:22:39,539 --> 01:22:44,058
Yeah, and you didn't believe her?
Of course I didn't believe her.

1167
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:46,898
Do you want to know the truth about
Margaret? Yes, I do.

1168
01:22:46,899 --> 01:22:51,738
She was my best friend but she couldn't
handle the fact that he was my son, not hers.

1169
01:22:51,739 --> 01:22:53,658
She was dying and she couldn't let
him go.

1170
01:22:53,659 --> 01:22:56,978
She'd sooner kill his whole future
stone-dead.

1171
01:22:56,979 --> 01:22:59,578
Margaret told you she was going to
the police?

1172
01:22:59,579 --> 01:23:02,698
Yeah, sure she did.
And you followed her into town.

1173
01:23:02,699 --> 01:23:05,298
You saw her and Emily
go into the police station.

1174
01:23:05,299 --> 01:23:07,699
You saw her come out and you followed
her.

1175
01:23:10,459 --> 01:23:12,299
She saw me on the platform...

1176
01:23:13,419 --> 01:23:15,018
..and she just walked away.

1177
01:23:15,019 --> 01:23:19,338
I called after her,
"Don't you walk away from me!"

1178
01:23:19,339 --> 01:23:23,338
She didn't tell you she hadn't said anything
to the police, hadn't made a statement?

1179
01:23:23,339 --> 01:23:26,418
No. That's... She walked away.

1180
01:23:26,419 --> 01:23:28,738
She kept her head down
and she walked away.

1181
01:23:28,739 --> 01:23:30,939
But you had the knife.

1182
01:23:32,859 --> 01:23:37,498
Ryan... Ryan had been showing off
with it the week before.

1183
01:23:37,499 --> 01:23:39,539
I confiscated it and...

1184
01:23:42,219 --> 01:23:44,858
I didn't know it was in my hand
until...

1185
01:23:44,859 --> 01:23:46,539
You stabbed her?

1186
01:23:50,299 --> 01:23:52,339
Once.

1187
01:23:59,699 --> 01:24:02,898
And she... She just walked away,

1188
01:24:02,899 --> 01:24:05,539
and she got on the train and she sat
down.

1189
01:24:19,739 --> 01:24:22,179
And smiled.

1190
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:28,699
And you got on the next train
back into the city?

1191
01:24:32,059 --> 01:24:33,219
Yes.

1192
01:24:39,259 --> 01:24:41,339
And Dee?

1193
01:24:43,859 --> 01:24:45,218
What?

1194
01:24:45,219 --> 01:24:46,859
Dee?

1195
01:24:51,699 --> 01:24:54,298
She remembered seeing me on the
train.

1196
01:24:54,299 --> 01:24:56,099
She told George.

1197
01:24:58,659 --> 01:25:00,859
Loyal to the last.
Right.

1198
01:25:04,219 --> 01:25:06,978
He paid her a few quid to keep her
happy.

1199
01:25:06,979 --> 01:25:09,499
Whose idea was that? His or yours?

1200
01:25:11,379 --> 01:25:12,419
Mine.

1201
01:25:14,299 --> 01:25:17,098
So she spent the money on booze...

1202
01:25:17,099 --> 01:25:18,739
got drunk, fell off a roof?

1203
01:25:19,499 --> 01:25:21,899
So it all worked out in the end,
didn't it?

1204
01:25:22,619 --> 01:25:24,499
No.

1205
01:25:26,419 --> 01:25:28,019
Ahh...

1206
01:25:31,419 --> 01:25:32,979
So, um...

1207
01:25:33,819 --> 01:25:35,379
..whatever you want...

1208
01:25:36,459 --> 01:25:38,539
..can we do it quietly, please?

1209
01:25:43,219 --> 01:25:45,459
Uniform on their way?

1210
01:25:46,779 --> 01:25:49,459
We can sit in and wait, if you like.

1211
01:25:53,819 --> 01:25:55,939
You know, Ryan...

1212
01:25:58,099 --> 01:26:00,139
..I swear to God...

1213
01:26:00,979 --> 01:26:03,219
..he didn't harm that poor girl.

1214
01:26:05,739 --> 01:26:07,779
He told me.

1215
01:26:23,499 --> 01:26:25,659
You never said how it ended.

1216
01:26:26,339 --> 01:26:27,579
What's that?

1217
01:26:28,379 --> 01:26:34,499
You're seven years old, on that island... it's
dark and your old man fell out of a tree.

1218
01:26:36,499 --> 01:26:38,499
Yeah, well, that's it.

1219
01:26:40,179 --> 01:26:43,979
What, there's no punchline?

1220
01:26:47,299 --> 01:26:49,379
My dad couldn't walk.

1221
01:26:50,699 --> 01:26:53,739
We stayed out all night, under a
rock.

1222
01:26:55,259 --> 01:26:59,339
Then this young fella -
Malcolm it must've been -

1223
01:27:01,419 --> 01:27:03,499
rowed us back in the morning.

1224
01:27:05,619 --> 01:27:08,259
Then me dad, when we got to the
car...

1225
01:27:09,779 --> 01:27:12,979
..he reached out, took my hand...

1226
01:27:15,099 --> 01:27:17,139
..like I was in charge.

1227
01:27:19,219 --> 01:27:21,219
And then...

1228
01:27:23,539 --> 01:27:25,539
..I grew up.

1229
01:27:34,899 --> 01:27:38,778
Here you go. A little something for
your Jessie.

1230
01:27:38,779 --> 01:27:40,938
Thank you.
Does she like fudge?

1231
01:27:40,939 --> 01:27:42,778
Erm...

1232
01:27:42,779 --> 01:27:44,979
Here he is, the walking wounded.

1233
01:27:46,379 --> 01:27:48,578
You lot still here?

1234
01:27:48,579 --> 01:27:52,498
Bloody hell, Kenny! How's the head?
Have you brain damage, Kenny?

1235
01:27:52,499 --> 01:27:55,618
It's not permanent, is it, mate?
See? What did I tell you?

1236
01:27:55,619 --> 01:27:58,699
You old goat. Who's this?
This is my daughter.

1237
01:28:00,339 --> 01:28:02,778
I've got two of each.

1238
01:28:02,779 --> 01:28:05,698
Marnie... various people I work with.

1239
01:28:05,699 --> 01:28:08,019
Oh, well, hello, love.

1240
01:28:08,779 --> 01:28:10,899
Good for you, Kenny.

1241
01:28:14,939 --> 01:28:17,178
Who was she?

1242
01:28:17,179 --> 01:28:19,659
She was just an old lady
who gave up her coat.

1243
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:33,139
Only if you're ready.

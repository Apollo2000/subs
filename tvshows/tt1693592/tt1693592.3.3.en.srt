00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,679
What are you, a girl?

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,590
Come on.
Play something real, man.

4
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,970
That's it.

5
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,890
There's someone...

8
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,170
"Young Gods"

9
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,790
Here.

10
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,990
Right you are.

11
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,030
Hello?

12
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,819
He's come off that edge
into the water.

13
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,809
A bunch of sixth formers on a residential
at the activity centre saw it happen.

14
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,609
Tried to get him out,
couldn't find him in the dark.

15
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,469
Divers pulled him out this morning.

16
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,669
-And he was burning?
-Give us a bell around lunchtime.

17
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,980
I'll have more for you then.

18
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,870
New phone -
you've got your own ringtone.

19
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,450
What?

20
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,430
Billy?

21
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,300
Fire burns upwards.

22
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,019
Lowest point of burning
gives you the point of ignition.

23
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,650
In this case -
here.

24
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,720
Burnt from the feet up -
no wonder jumped.

25
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,610
Must have been in agony.

26
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,350
Ma'am.

27
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,030
Gideon Frane.

28
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,539
Extreme sports
fanatic. 25 years of age.

29
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,379
Parents live abroad.
They've been informed.

30
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,770
No siblings, no partner.

31
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,809
Well, how come
we've got so much on him so fast?

32
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,129
All the intel's come from the fella
who runs the place - Jim McKinnon.

33
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,769
He ID'd the body.

34
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,519
Cannot stop talking,
according to Kenny, with the shock.

35
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,820
Or guilt.

36
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,799
No, his alibi's good.

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,300
Aye.
According to Kenny.

38
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,969
<i>Is there anything else
you remember a all?</i>

39
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,329
<i>That's all I saw, really.
It happened pretty quick.</i>

40
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,749
-How's she handling herself - Shep?
-Good.

41
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,909
I reckon the military
police's loss is our gain.

42
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,299
-Aye.
-We've got statements from the kids

43
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,650
who witnessed it.
Same story from everyone.

44
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,609
They heard an altercation
and then saw him on fire.

45
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,019
School's keen on letting
the parents take them home.

46
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,609
And you thought you'd
spend your first day

47
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,880
learning how the coffee machine
works, right?

48
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,560
-Private school, is it?
-Yeah, St Finan's.

49
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,450
They had the whole place booked out
for the sixth form.

50
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,549
What was Gideon Frane doing here?

51
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,289
Apparently, he invested money
in the centre a while back.

52
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,900
He spent all his time off here.

53
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,209
He even kept a "yurt"
in the grounds.

54
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,690
You know,
one of those Mongolian tents.

55
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,530
-Time off from what?
-Investment banking.

56
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,150
Well, let's go meet
Kenny's talkative friend.

57
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,749
We were going under.

58
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,629
Bailiffs literally...
at the door.

59
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,579
So Gideon saved your centre
from ruin.

60
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,299
No question.
No question.

61
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,920
It wasn't just the money,
it was the ideas.

62
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,409
<i>Turf 'N' Surf.</i>

63
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,769
Treetop adventures,
along with coast-steering, diving.

64
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,610
We were planning a via ferrata.

65
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,819
Make Coniston look like
a kids' playground.

66
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,529
Yeah, and you last saw Mr. Frane?

67
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,569
Tuesday evening, seven o'clock.
1900 hours.

68
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,659
I know because I was meeting
some friends in a pub

69
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,960
and was running late.

70
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,550
I asked if he wanted to come but he
said he was going back to the yurt.

71
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,109
The thing is, I know it's going to come
out so I'd rather tell you guys now.

72
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,590
Nothing hidden or concealed,
like I said to your man.

73
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,129
I'd rather lay it all out,
everything. And then you'll know.

74
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,280
Know what, Mr. McKinnon?

75
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,649
The planning office said no.

76
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,289
After everything
Gideon had done for us,

77
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,109
I was scared to tell him.

78
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,520
So...
I put it up anyway.

79
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,910
The yurt?

80
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,050
It's illegal.

81
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,089
Only got to see a police officer
and they start confessing to anything

82
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,790
from losing a library book
to cheating on their missus.

83
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,450
We're gonna be hours sifting through
that lot.

84
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,709
Still, I'll check out that
investment of Gideon's.

85
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,980
-Right.
-Make sure there's no motive in it.

86
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,210
It looks like a fight.

87
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,120
But what set him alight?

88
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,489
So the fight starts inside the yurt
and then moves outside.

89
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,569
And then either accidentally
or on purpose,

90
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,739
Gideon's assailant gets him
into the fire pit.

91
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,109
No, his shoes weren't burnt.

92
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,709
Maybe he wasn't in it long enough
for his shoes to burn, you know.

93
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,450
Just for his combat trousers
to take light.

94
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,830
Wasn't she at the adventure centre?

95
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,030
Hello, love.

96
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,769
I'm Detective Chief Inspector
Vera Stanhope

97
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,759
from the Northumberland
and City Police.

98
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,250
We were just up at Craith.

99
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,929
I thought everyone was being
picked up by their parents.

100
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,070
I didn't want to bother me mam.
Be fine on the bus.

101
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,769
We can give you a lift.
What way you going?

102
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,850
It's really kind of you,
but...

103
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,290
-I'm still a bit shaky.
-Yeah.

104
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,010
I was planning on having a cry
at the back of the bus.

105
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,729
You don't have to be worried about
crying in here, love.

106
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,699
My sergeant does it al the time.

107
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,000
Come on.

108
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,490
Hop in the back.

109
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,590
-Sorry.
-Here you are, love.

110
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,649
I don't blame you.

111
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,790
It's a difficult thing.
It will take a while to settle.

112
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,170
It was just so sudden.

113
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,620
We heard him shouting
and then...

114
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,960
it probably only lasted a few
seconds.

115
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,369
It's coming up on the left.

116
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,210
Do you want us to come in with you?
Let your mum know what happened?

117
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,399
I'll talk to her later.

118
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,590
When the little ones are in their
beds.

119
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,529
Ruben, run. Run fast, she's coming
after us.

120
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,089
How many times
has Mam told you?

121
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,390
It's a road!

122
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,609
I'm really sorry.
Thanks again for the lift.

123
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,190
Was Alex there?
Did he like your hair?

124
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,449
Where's their mother?
They could have been killed.

125
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,599
Maybe she's at work.

126
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,519
Can't all be your Celine -

127
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,690
homemade fairy cakes,
towels that match the soap.

128
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,269
-There's no need to sneer.
-I'm not.

129
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,119
I'm just saying,
17-year-old girl witnesses a murder.

130
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,769
She has to get the bus home cos she
doesn't want to bother her mam.

131
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,489
Maybe it's not a murder.

132
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,259
Till we've got something concrete to
go on, it could be anything.

133
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,590
Accident, misadventure
or spontaneous human combustion.

134
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,530
Anything.

135
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,649
Gideon Frane.

136
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,769
Now we know who he was,
what he did for a living,

137
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,929
and that he loved extreme sports.

138
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,429
What we don't know
is how and why he came to be alight.

139
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,899
But more importantly,
we don't know who he was arguing with

140
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,830
before he appeared on fire
on the edge of the cliff, so...

141
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,399
Where do we start looking?

142
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,139
Investment banker?

143
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,479
Well, nobody's favourite
profession at the moment.

144
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,689
There's something about burning.
It's personal, sadistic.

145
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,969
People hate bankers as a group,
not as individuals.

146
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,409
Well, all the same...
Mark, get on to the FIO.

147
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,849
Let's check out any groups,

148
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,459
activists who might have
targeted someone like Frane.

149
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,059
What about Jim McKinnon?

150
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,169
The money that Gideon
invested in the centre.

151
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,219
-No, I checked. There's nothing going on there.
-Well, I'm with Joe.

152
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,889
Even if this was just a fight
that took a wrong turn,

153
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,290
I think it's personal.

154
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,629
So, let's keep coming at this
from both angles.

155
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,759
Personal and professional.

156
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,069
Joe, Kenny,

157
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,439
I want to know who was in the
vicinity of that adventure centre.

158
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,009
Teachers, pupils,
centre workers.

159
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,679
Dog walkers,
stargazers, everyone.

160
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,739
And, Shep, I want to know who he
worked with,
who he socialised with.

161
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,649
Who he slept with.

162
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,440
McKinnon said he
didn't have a partner.

163
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,299
Maybe not a partner,
but...

164
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,580
if I was built like that
I'd not be wasting time.

165
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,520
Get back to McKinnon, then.

166
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,409
That interview -
that was a station record.

167
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,390
That man can talk for England
and breathe through his arse.

168
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,969
Get him talking about
Gideon Frane's sex life, then.

169
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,329
Now, come on, everyone, let's give
ourselves something to go on.

170
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,630
Shep.

171
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,670
Ma'am?

172
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,520
-Has Kenny done something to his hair?
-New woman.

173
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,599
Billy.

174
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,100
Lungs, full of water. He drowned.

175
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,309
I blame the coat.
It's polyester and duck down.

176
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,439
Went up like a Roman candle
and took in water like a sponge.

177
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,819
Might as well have gone swimming
in a burning duvet.

178
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,689
Not that I've ever tried, mind.

179
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,130
Flaming bedding,
that's a bit niche even for me.

180
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,209
Would he survived without the water,
without the drowning?

181
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,390
First and second-degree burns
over 60% of his body, it's doubtful.

182
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,429
I need to know why he was burning,
Billy.

183
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,879
I need to know if I'm looking at
accident or intention.

184
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,769
Doing my best for you.

185
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,960
# Cos I'd catch a grenade for you,
Vera

186
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,790
# Throw my hand on a blade for you,
Vera... #

187
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,170
Yeah, I'll call you.

188
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,390
No!

189
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,969
-Joe?
<i>-Kenny got a name out</i>

190
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,279
<i>of Jim McKinnon.</i>

191
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,209
Gideon Frane used to date
a girl called Izzy

192
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,289
about a year back,
a hairdresser.

193
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,370
<i>-I think I've tracked her down.</i>
-Right.

194
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,350
City Centre Salon.

195
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,280
Apparently,
it's a late-night opening tonight.

196
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,890
Northumberland and City Police.

197
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,169
We were hoping to have a word
with one of your stylists - Izzy?

198
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,450
-I'll see if she's free.
-Thanks, love.

199
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,010
Hey.

200
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,390
-What have you done to your hand?
-Cor, here, look at that.

201
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,819
Sausages - all full of bloody water
these days.

202
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,289
Can't put them near an oil pan.

203
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,199
-What are you doing frying stuff?
-You what?

204
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,529
The doctor gave you
all of those diet sheets.

205
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,369
Are you like this at home?

206
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,760
Cos the kids will be leaving as soon
as they've scraped up the bus fare.

207
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,100
Can I help you?

208
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,080
-Izzy?
-Yeah.

209
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,569
Izzy, I'm Vera Stanhope,
Northumberland and City Police.

210
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,750
This is my sergeant Joe Ashworth.

211
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,849
I believe you used to date
a man called Gideon Frane.

212
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,449
Is that right?

213
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,330
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.

214
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,590
Have you had any contact with him
since you stopped seeing him?

215
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,790
Are you being funny?

216
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,019
My file must be a foot thick

217
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,820
with all the
incidents I've logged.

218
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,169
Isn't that why you're here?

219
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,020
No, I think...

220
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,890
we're at crossed
purposes here, pet.

221
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,279
We're investigating the death

222
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,490
in suspicious circumstances
of Gideon Frane.

223
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,970
We were wondering if you might be
able
to help us with our inquiries.

224
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,850
Gideon...
Gideon's dead?

225
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,650
Thank God.

226
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,610
Oh, thank God.

227
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,549
97 incidents over
a 12-month period.

228
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,959
Low-level harassment
escalating to abusive messages,

229
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,789
threats and criminal damage.

230
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,539
Izzy was so scared,
she moved out.

231
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,609
Been sleeping on a friend's sofa
the last nine months.

232
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,339
So why wasn't Gideon
Frane arrested?

233
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,689
No proof.

234
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,110
Never any witnesses.
No CCTV evidence.

235
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,159
Never used a phone that
could be tracked back to him.

236
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,989
He knew what he was doing.

237
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,169
Well,
maybe he's done it before.

238
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,889
We ran him through the computer.
Nothing prior to this.

239
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,529
Well, Izzy's got friends,
support.

240
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,700
Someone more isolated
might not have come forward.

241
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,790
Shep, see what you can dig up
on any previous relationships.

242
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,429
She was so let down.

243
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,539
Aye, well, they say they were
building a case.

244
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,490
Aye, maybe towards the end,
but, I mean, look at all this.

245
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,070
-Nobody took her seriously for months.
-Be fair.

246
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:49,399
"Complainant reported ex-boyfriend
followed her to and from work."

247
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,499
Wasn't breaking any laws -
what could they do?

248
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,349
But she's reporting incident after
incident and nobody made the link.

249
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,419
Nobody saw there was a pattern
forming. That's why it escalated,

250
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,200
because he knew no-one was
gonna do anything about it.

251
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,880
And?
What?

252
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,829
It's just in a situation like this,
you can kind of see why someone

253
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,950
would want to take matters
into their own hands.

254
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,670
So what's her alibi?

255
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,270
I told you that when
you came into work.

256
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,650
We'd just like to go through it in a
bit more detail.

257
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,130
The night before last...?

258
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,789
-I was at the flat with Kit.
-Was there anyone else with you?

259
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,279
No, just me and Izzy,
watching telly.

260
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,029
-Anything good?
-Not really.

261
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,469
But we had a drink. Had
a laugh, you know.

262
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,529
How long have you lived at Kit's?

263
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,589
Ever since psycho boy
drowned her cat in a bucket

264
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,039
and left it on the doorstop as a
birthday present.

265
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,569
Not that anyone could prove it was
him,
of course.

266
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,239
Sweetest girl in the world.
She'd do anything for anyone -

267
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,920
and she ends up with him.

268
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,339
Still, it's a big thing opening
your door to a friend like that.

269
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,649
Well, somebody had to help.

270
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,299
Christ knows you lot
weren't doing anything.

271
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,609
Shocking, really.

272
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,889
Makes us wonder
why we pay our taxes.

273
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,730
Why'd they split up?

274
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,850
I...

275
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,710
I found out he was seeing other
people.

276
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,980
Any names?

277
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,800
I don't think he asked their names.

278
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,690
Wasn't that kind of seeing.

279
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,540
I went the doctor's.

280
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,150
I thought maybe I'd picked up an
infection
from the swimming pool.

281
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,470
A doctor put me right, anyway.

282
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,880
I was going to confront Gideon,
but when it came to it I just cried.

283
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,470
It's pathetic.

284
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,650
So you broke it off.

285
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,610
And then?

286
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,770
At first, I...

287
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,459
I thought it was because he wanted
me back.

288
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,290
You know, he wanted that second
chance.

289
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,989
That's when I realised...

290
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,819
He couldn't stand the fact
it was her doing the leaving.

291
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,269
He couldn't stand
not being able to control her.

292
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,750
He really was a worthless
piece of shit.

293
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,890
Ma'am.

294
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,390
So is there anything else
you want to tell us?

295
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,330
I like your friend's hair.

296
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,870
House to house, Kenny.

297
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,390
I want every door near that flat
knocked on.

298
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:53,390
I want that alibi either
firmed up or shot down.

299
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,170
Right you are, ma'am.
What about Tinkerbell and his friend?

300
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,629
And you wonder why
he thinks we're the enemy.

301
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,360
Joe, with me.

302
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,159
What?

303
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,949
Laceration across the <i>hallucis
longus</i>.

304
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,439
Now, whatever did it

305
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,189
took a chip out his
shin bone as well so

306
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,859
so we're talking an impact of some
force.

307
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,309
But...
here's the thing.

308
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:28,029
Fragment of combat trouser
retrieved from inside the gash.

309
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,649
Now,
the sharp-eyed among you will note

310
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:30,979
that it shows no
sign of burning,

311
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,769
meaning it was pushed into the flesh
before the fire took hold.

312
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,899
-From which the discerning and logical mind...
-Stop grandstanding, Billy.

313
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,679
-I'm not in the mood.
-Whatever did that

314
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,050
also set him alight.

315
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,710
An impact of some force.

316
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,250
So they either hit him with it,

317
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,249
-threw it at him... What?
-What is it?

318
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,829
I'd say something with
a sharp metal edge.

319
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,089
As for the fuel...

320
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,750
His clothes were made from
petrochemical textiles.

321
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,749
They'll contain the same
constituents as most accelerants,

322
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,259
so be hard to
identify any traces

323
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,799
even if he hadn't
been in the water.

324
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,129
Yeah.
OK, Joe, get on to CSI,

325
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,189
see if they've found anything
in the vicinity of the yurt

326
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,179
that fits the bill.
All right?

327
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,210
You want me to put something
on that for you?

328
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,400
What? No, I'd think you were
laying me out.

329
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,569
Actually, Billy, you know, you're
not looking so clever yourself.

330
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,370
Too many late nights?

331
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,850
Just off me food.
Happens once in a while.

332
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,710
You know,
one case in a while.

333
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:54,340
With fire it's almost always
the smoke that kills them.

334
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,429
Couple of lungfuls
and it's "Good night, Vienna".

335
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,700
Burns come post mortem.
But...

336
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,850
he was alive.

337
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,420
Well...
if it helps...

338
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,520
they say he wasn't one
of life's best.

339
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,540
"Worthless piece of shit"
was the phrase used.

340
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,029
Yeah, well, same could be said
of me.

341
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,200
In fact, I think I've got it
in writing.

342
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,630
No, it's about the flesh.

343
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,350
The nerves, the pain.

344
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,789
So, no, it doesn't help,
but thanks, anyway.

345
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,650
CSI haven't found anything
that matches that description.

346
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,130
Right, well, they didn't know
what they were looking for, did they?

347
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,690
Joe!

348
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,420
Thrown at him hard enough to chip a
bone.

349
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,410
Now the lamp oil would have ignited
on impact.

350
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,650
This is now a murder investigation.

351
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,139
So what have you got for me?

352
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,290
Something happened at Gideon's bank
a few days ago.

353
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,900
It might be unrelated but...

354
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,249
I got nothing on Gideon
professionally.

355
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,069
He didn't stand out as being
any more ruthless than the next man.

356
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,659
But one of his
colleagues mentioned

357
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,329
an attempted mugging
a few days ago.

358
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,490
So I got tapes off security.

359
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,499
No, it looks like an internet hoax.

360
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,520
Yeti fighting the Big Foot.

361
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:28,460
Wait a minute. Something's wrong
here. Take it back.

362
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,320
Look at that.

363
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,869
It looks like the mugger's
calling him.

364
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,859
Now why would a mugger do that,

365
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,459
make his presence known?

366
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,610
Lose the element of surprise.

367
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,970
Ma'am?

368
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,980
They told me to come straight up.

369
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,350
I think I've got something.

370
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:58,310
I've been opening whatever's arrived
for Gideon.

371
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:04,159
I didn't think that this one
would be any different.

372
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,999
-No. Shall I...
-I thought there might be prints.

373
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,670
Hey, give it us here.

374
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,940
It's been in the post,
it's probably been handled
by half the country.

375
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,090
Well done.

376
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,760
"You will burn in hell."

377
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,249
What is that, a threat?

378
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,550
A prophecy?

379
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,250
A warning?

380
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,350
-What's this?
-Frozen peas.

381
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,620
For my hand, last night.

382
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,979
Oh, sit on my hat,
man.

383
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,000
A bit of damp's
not gonna hurt you.

384
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:04,600
Gum residue at the top.
Definitely torn from a pad.

385
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,400
Can you tell if anything was written
on the page above?

386
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,200
There's something there,
but the indentations are too shallow.

387
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,370
I think it's time for my favourite
magic trick.

388
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,880
Well, well, well.
Kit O'Dowd.

389
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,380
It's all right, pet,
we know the way.

390
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,800
-How are you?
-I'm great.

391
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:14,350
This is me...
coming quietly.

392
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,039
The notepad it
was written on

393
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,429
was last used to write a
letter to your landlord

394
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,949
complaining about the boiler.

395
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,679
He ought to be prosecuted -
the rent he charges!

396
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,719
-So do you do recognise this?
-Yeah.

397
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,960
-Did you send it?
-Yes.

398
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,989
-Why?
-He was texting her,

399
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,769
saying he was gonna get her
gang-raped.

400
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,839
And all the police said was,
"Keep logging the incidents."

401
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,959
You lot -
what are you even for?

402
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,639
Cheeky bloody sod.

403
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,320
<i>Would you mind taking
your shirt off for me, pet?</i>

404
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,679
<i>I'll tell the papers you said that.</i>

405
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,980
Shirt.

406
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,010
Where did you get them bruises?

407
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,060
We have you on CCTV in
the underground car park

408
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,399
of the office where
Gideon Frane worked.

409
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,199
Thought we weren't doing enough?

410
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,560
Thought you'd take matters
into your own hands?

411
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,950
-What did you say to him?
-I told him to leave Izzy alone.

412
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,860
And?

413
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,860
And...

414
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,049
I didn't tell her.
I didn't want to upset her.

415
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,690
-Did you kill Gideon Frane?
-I wish.

416
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,640
No.

417
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,140
I didn't.

418
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,979
Have you seen the kit I pack at
work?

419
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,929
I got a cut-throat razor!

420
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,599
I use scissors that could take your
ear off.

421
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,440
What would I bother bloody
burning a man to death?

422
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,220
-What's all this, then?
-Coincidence.

423
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,399
-I wanted to scare him.
-Specific, though.

424
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,239
-"You will burn..."
-"..in hell."

425
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,179
It wasn't meant to be literal.
It was Biblical.

426
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,609
Hellfire and damnation.
Judgment Day.

427
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,729
Oh, so you're a religious man,
are you, Mr. O'Dowd?

428
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,429
It just fitted.
I don't know why.

429
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,960
Maybe because of his background,
St Finan's being a church school.

430
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,539
Gideon Frane went to St Finan's?

431
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,429
I just wanted him to feel like
someone was watching.

432
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,319
Like someone knew.

433
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,980
I just wanted him to stop.

434
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,379
Joe, get yourself in
front of the magistrate.

435
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,059
I want a warrant to
search his flat.

436
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,360
OK.

437
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,619
Why are we bothering with
the magistrate?

438
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,159
He's got the motive,
an unproven alibi.

439
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,229
And he's admitted to sending him
a malicious communication.

440
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,589
Why do we not just arrest him?

441
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,719
Because I don't want to blow it by
jumping the gun.

442
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,669
When we've got concrete evidence

443
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,560
linking him to the death of Gideon
Frane, then we'll make an arrest.

444
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,000
In the meantime he's free to go.

445
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,060
So, go on.

446
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,599
Oh, here he is, Mr. Hint of a Tint.

447
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,030
And I thought I was the only gay
in the village.

448
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,320
Get out.

449
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,279
But don't leave the country.
Don't even leave the town.

450
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,449
We will be talking to you again.

451
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,519
So, what?
That's it?

452
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,270
I'm not under arrest?

453
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,980
If it was up to me,
sunshine...

454
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,729
Ma'am?

455
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,479
You asked me to look into
Gideon Frane's past relationships.

456
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,649
Do I pursue that or are we
standing down all lines of inquiry

457
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,029
-except Kit O'Dowd?
-No, pursue it.

458
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,519
It might be worth
going right back.

459
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,979
Gideon Frane went to St Finan's.

460
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,150
Same school as the kids at the lake.

461
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,689
Joe,
when you've got the warrant,

462
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,999
tell the search team we're
looking for traces

463
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,459
of lamp oil,
and soil from the woods.

464
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,980
Anything to put Kit O'Dowd
at the scene.

465
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,749
What are you doing if
we need to find you?

466
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,050
Research.

467
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,389
They finished searching
Kit O'Dowd's flat. Nothing.

468
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,800
Shut the door.
Don't let all the heat out.

469
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,200
Look, I don't think he did it.

470
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,070
He made a silly threat
with a random choice of words.

471
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,889
And now he realises
no one is gonna believe

472
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,319
he had nothing to do
with Gideon's death.

473
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,899
That's why he's acting all jumpy.

474
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,770
I mean, I'd be scared, wouldn't you?

475
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,090
You didn't expect to find anything
in that flat, did you?

476
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,629
You don't think he did
it any more than I do?

477
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,930
No.

478
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,390
Cheeky little bugger,
but I don't think he killed anyone.

479
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,760
Have you got any milk?

480
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,290
No,
I'm watching my cholesterol.

481
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,949
So if you don't think he did it,

482
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,159
-why'd you search the flat?
-We can't rule him out

483
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,999
just because you and me
don't fancy him for it.

484
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,750
And Kenny's right - more than
reasonable grounds for suspicion.

485
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,900
I mean,
"You will burn..."

486
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,880
If we're going to eliminate him...

487
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,909
we need proof positive
that he wasn't there

488
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,530
when Gideon
was killed.

489
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,869
-That still looks sore.
-Yeah.

490
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:21,279
You know, when a kid's hurt themself
it's amazing how quickly it heals.

491
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,150
You can almost watch it happen.

492
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,889
Tonight I told Celine
I'd look after myself.

493
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,429
I was gonna get a takeaway.
What do you fancy?

494
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:32,500
No, you're all right.
I've already eaten.

495
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,720
What did they think
they were going to find
when they got to Gideon's yurt?

496
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,810
A man catches fire,
goes over the cliff, then drowns.

497
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,979
If you're planning to commit murder,

498
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,189
that's leaving an awful lot
to chance.

499
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,120
What was his plan?

500
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,749
-Where's the washing-up?
-What?

501
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,400
You said you'd eaten.
Where's the plates, the pans?

502
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,069
That's it, isn't it?
That's your evening meal.

503
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,379
I've been busy.

504
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,369
Was planning to do some
shopping tomorrow,

505
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,079
as it happens not that
it's any of your business.

506
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,239
When are you gonna get yourself
organised? Get something delivered.

507
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,489
When are you gonna
take care of yourself?

508
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,399
And when are you gonna
get off my case?

509
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,959
Telling me what to do
under my own roof.

510
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,750
Go home, will you?
I've got work to do.

511
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,439
Every witness at the quarry talked
about hearing an argument.

512
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,389
An altercation.
Every witness,

513
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,529
-except one.
-Ruthie Culvert.

514
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,480
-The girl we gave a lift to.
-Yeah. She said she heard him shouting.

515
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,150
Not them, him.

516
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,820
Get in.

517
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,119
DCI Vera Stanhope,
Northumberland and City Police.

518
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,909
And this is my sergeant,
Joe Ashworth.

519
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,559
Could we come in, Mrs. Culvert?

520
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,120
-It's about yesterday.
-Yeah.

521
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,279
My dad was police.
CID.

522
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,689
Retired now. He's just picking
Ruthie up from school.

523
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,559
He'll be back in a minute.

524
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,709
Saturday morning school.
There's keen.

525
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,969
She can't afford to slack off
if she wants to keep the scholarship.

526
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,299
St Finan's do scholarships,
do they?

527
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,699
We could never have afforded it
otherwise.

528
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,409
I lost my husband just
before Max was born.

529
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,519
Dad helps out so we manage, but...

530
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,339
you know, it's all held together
with chewing gum and string.

531
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,490
Yeah, I know how you feel.

532
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,639
Hello again, love.

533
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,350
We were wondering if
we could have a word?

534
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,559
It's hard to remember.

535
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,280
Everyone's talked so much about it
since.

536
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,670
You forget what's your own memory
and what's someone else's.

537
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,119
But you stand by what you said, hm?

538
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:58,980
You didn't hear an argument,
just a single voice shouting?

539
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,050
He sounded angry.

540
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,220
Love.

541
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,290
I don't know.
Maybe it was two voices.

542
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,759
I'm really sorry. I can't help you.

543
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,920
No, don't be daft.
You've been a real help.

544
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,399
Oi, stop it.
What are you doing?

545
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,580
-What's that?
-Leave me alone. I'll be fine.

546
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,370
-Morning.
-Hi.

547
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,290
About what happened
at the adventure centre, is it?

548
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,690
Now, you of all people should
know we're not at liberty...

549
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,590
Is it ex-CID?

550
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,300
Look...

551
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,399
It really upset Ruthie.

552
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,079
She didn't wanna worry her mother.
She came to me.

553
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,799
I was hoping her statement
would be the end of it.

554
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,469
We just wanted to go over a few
details.

555
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,780
Yes, still, it stirs things up.

556
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,740
Maybe a good idea
to see if she's all right.

557
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,599
And you might want to give
your daughter a hand.

558
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,200
One of them's got something
stuck in his hair.

559
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,579
Feral, the lot of them.

560
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,039
You should put
them in a zoo.

561
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,949
How can anyone live in that chaos?
I wouldn't be able to think.

562
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:26,729
Before you say anything, Celine
buys soap to go with the towels,

563
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,559
-not the other way around.
-It's an impulse, isn't it?

564
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,619
Tidy things up, make them neat.

565
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,750
Smooth over the inconsistencies.

566
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,409
If something doesn't make sense,

567
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,689
you adjust it mentally
so that it does.

568
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,480
It's not even conscious.

569
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,180
All of them...

570
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,450
Hearing something
they thought was there.

571
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,979
But not her.
Not Ruthie.

572
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,119
We've been picking away
and picking away at this,

573
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,439
and this is the first
time we've got something

574
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,209
we can really grab hold of -

575
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,719
one voice, arguing.

576
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,469
Well, what if the other
voice didn't carry?

577
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,000
It was a woman or a child.

578
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,790
Or a phone call.

579
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,899
Vera?

580
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,980
Is there any chance at all

581
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:22,120
that Gideon Frane could have
caused that injury himself?

582
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,359
He'd have to have been
throwing himself around some.

583
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,959
Yeah, but theoretically?

584
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,049
Theoretically, if he lashed out hard
enough and the lantern was there,

585
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,410
aye, it's possible.

586
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,179
Why would he start chucking himself
around?

587
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,429
Alcohol,
psychotropic drugs.

588
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,090
If he was a user,
we'd have heard about it by now.

589
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,359
Ma'am?

590
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,989
Gideon Frane's
phone records?

591
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,299
Nothing yet.

592
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,299
But Kit and Izzy's alibi -
just checked out.

593
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,929
There's something else.

594
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,599
The professional complaint
against Gideon was a dead end,

595
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,409
but I looked at St Finan's,
like you said.

596
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,399
Gideon Frane didn't just go there -
he was head boy.

597
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,700
Look at this.

598
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,110
Right.

599
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,860
This was his girlfriend,
Manda Adelaide.

600
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,570
And this is her...

601
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,050
after she broke up with him.

602
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,969
Suicide attempt,
apparently.

603
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,750
Threw herself
down the stairs.

604
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:22,049
-So where's she now?
-No one knows.

605
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,770
After that she dropped out of
school, dropped out fo her exams.

606
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:28,010
Basically she disappeared.

607
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:41,589
It's the same head teacher now
as when Gideon was at school.

608
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,230
Doctor Ripman.

609
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,929
Although apparently
it's school tradition

610
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,190
to call the head "the Master".

611
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,950
Jessie would love it here.

612
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:01,849
On a sergeant's salary?
Dream on, love.

613
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,850
I don't know, Jessie's a bright girl.

614
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,650
You know, if they offered
a scholarship.

615
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,860
Beats me why anyone
would want one.

616
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,720
Bloody Hogwarts.

617
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,530
Excuse me, love.

618
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,369
Do you happen to know where
we might find "the Master"?

619
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:26,450
-In there.
-Thanks, love.

620
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:47,270
-What?
-Nothing. You know...

621
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,780
Head teacher's office.

622
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,170
So sorry to have kept you waiting.

623
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:57,369
-Dr. Ripman?
-Don't tell me you were expecting a man?

624
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,469
How very unsisterly of you.

625
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,369
Ah, well, "the Master" had
me confused.

626
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:06,369
DCI Stanhope,
Northumberland and City Police.

627
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:08,689
-This is my sergeant.
-Vivienne Ripman.

628
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,110
DS Ashworth.

629
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,410
No, the title is just
a matter of tradition.

630
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,329
When I was appointed,

631
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,169
the governors
hummed and hawed,

632
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,609
and in the end
suggested I might like

633
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:20,990
to call myself "the Mistress".

634
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:24,189
I ask you!
With 800 teenage boys

635
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,539
all finely tuned to the slightest
sexual nuance.

636
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,119
I stuck with Master,
started admitting girls.

637
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,590
Problem solved.

638
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:35,390
-How may I help you?
-Gideon Frane.

639
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,800
Yes. Of course.

640
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:48,829
Gideon was one of that rare breed
who really do seem to have it all.

641
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,260
Fine mind, academic prowess,
superb athlete.

642
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:55,089
Did he ever get into any trouble?

643
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,229
I once relieved him of
a pack of Marlboro Lights,

644
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:59,229
but other than that...
exemplary.

645
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,459
-Hence the Head of School.
-It was a big honour that, was it?

646
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,969
Yes. Gideon wasn't always able
to join his parents for holidays.

647
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,969
The school became his security.
He valued that.

648
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,719
Was it a coincidence
your sixth formers

649
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,690
went to the adventure centre
he'd invested in?

650
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:19,369
Not at all. I make a point of
supporting the ventures of ex-alumni.

651
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:21,739
The old school tie, eh?

652
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,750
Let's say my eye is always on the
next set of sixth form internships.

653
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:29,119
I'm curious as to why you think
Gideon's school career

654
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,289
might have any bearing on his death.

655
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,929
Actually,

656
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,750
we were interested in a
girlfriend he had at the time.

657
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,929
Manda Adelaide.

658
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:46,209
Yes, they were quite a pair,
those two.

659
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,529
That phrase from Shakespeare -

660
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:51,289
"Golden lads and girls" -
always made me think of them.

661
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,020
Doesn't sound so golden to me,
love.

662
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:57,050
Dropping out,
suicide attempt.

663
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:01,209
Manda was one of those high-flyers
who never quite find their wings.

664
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:02,870
It happens sometimes.

665
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:05,419
I felt it personally in her case

666
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,329
because she was in the first intake
of girls to the school.

667
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:10,460
My girls, I suppose.

668
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,160
She could have blazed very bright.
Terrible waste.

669
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,450
Do you know what happened to her?

670
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,900
I'm afraid she didn't keep links
with the school.

671
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,870
Well, what about this lad?

672
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,089
-Who's he?
-Jamie Levinson.

673
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,389
Any ideas where we might find him?

674
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:31,859
The last I heard, Acklington Prison.

675
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,549
Drugs offences.
He was expelled.

676
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:37,750
A serious and unprovoked attack
on another pupil.

677
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:41,169
Gideon Frane, as a matter of fact.

678
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,799
Any idea what was behind it?

679
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,909
Affairs of the heart
tend to loom large at that age.

680
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:50,249
-You think Manda was involved?
-Speculation only, but yes.

681
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,300
That was my inference
at the time.

682
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:56,930
I'm afraid that's my cue.
Chemistry with the lower sixth.

683
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,290
Just one more thing, love.

684
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,779
We passed a plaque on
the wall down there -

685
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,949
the Frane Wing.

686
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,579
That wouldn't have anything to do
with Gideon Frane, would it?

687
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,319
It was endowed by his family.

688
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,159
We owe many of our facilities

689
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,950
to the generosity of ex-alumni.

690
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:20,650
As you said, old school tie.

691
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:23,790
An entire wing?

692
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:28,350
Don't tell me that doesn't buy you
a head boy-ship and more.

693
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,809
You think Gideon killed his
ex-girlfriend

694
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,339
and then Dr. Ripman covered it up

695
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,729
in exchange for
some new classrooms?

696
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:38,729
No. But the first woman ever
to be appointed head.

697
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,580
She must have had an awful lot to
prove.

698
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:44,630
And even more...
to lose.

699
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:07,990
Shep.

700
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,590
All right, we'll take it.
All right.

701
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:14,790
What?

702
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:16,979
Someone called the incident hotline.

703
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,450
Said they've got information
about Gideon Frane.

704
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:23,089
-A nun.
-A nun?

705
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:25,760
Calling from an outreach project
for abused woman.

706
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,390
-What was her name again?
-Claire. Sister Claire.

707
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:25,989
We understand you have
some information for us, Sister...

708
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,509
-Claire.
-Claire.

709
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:31,300
-Information about Gideon Frane?
-Yes.

710
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:34,539
When I heard there was
a murder investigation,

711
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,560
I thought you might come
looking for me.

712
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,840
And you'd be right,
Manda...

713
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:42,090
Adelaide.

714
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,650
We should go somewhere else.

715
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,350
Some of the children
are nervous of men.

716
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:59,589
-Can I have three teas, mate?
-Yeah. I'll bring them over.

717
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,439
Sure. If she says anything
about the doughnuts,

718
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,890
tell her you've run out.

719
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,349
So it was a genuine suicide attempt.

720
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:11,939
-I was very unhappy at the time.
-Because of Gideon?

721
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,280
Gideon was part of it.

722
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,699
Why did it end between
the two of you?

723
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,029
He brought out the worst of me.
I got sick of not liking myself.

724
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:22,029
Now, you said you had
some information for us, love.

725
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:24,569
I suppose I'm the information.

726
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:26,940
Well, me not being dead.

727
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:29,610
Why would we think
you would be?

728
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:36,639
When I got myself back on my feet
I took a degree in psychology.

729
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,329
Our ministry's rooted in the idea

730
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,269
that we're in the world
to serve the world

731
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,610
so I'm studying for another now in
social work.

732
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:47,529
Gideon was never violent towards me
but...

733
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,119
he was controlling.

734
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,709
He liked to dominate.

735
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,269
He could very easily become someone
who did that kind of harm.

736
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:54,890
He had the profile.

737
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:59,859
I didn't want you to waste
your time looking for me.

738
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,190
Looking at back then for answers.

739
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:06,850
Thanks, love.

740
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,320
Just let us know if you want
any doughnuts.

741
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,990
I'm not lying to a nun.

742
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:20,490
Have you had any contact
with Jamie Levinson?

743
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:24,190
No.
No, not for a long time.

744
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:33,950
Well, I don't know about your man
back there not wanting to lie to a nun,

745
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:36,909
but she's not
telling us the truth.

746
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,820
Not the whole truth anyway.

747
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:40,510
Vera?

748
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:44,730
Vera Stanhope.

749
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:48,120
Yeah, I know,
you'd think I'd be dead by now.

750
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,830
-Sister Benedict?
-Vera Stanhope.

751
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:56,759
Now I know it's something
tremendous that you do

752
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,980
but you'll have to remind me.

753
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:03,340
I'm 800 years old, you see,
and I can't remember a thing.

754
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,129
Police.
It's the police.

755
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:09,780
-Police. Of course.
-This is my sergeant.

756
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,579
Joe Ashworth.

757
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,789
That marvellous questioning
mind she had.

758
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:18,470
I always knew she'd either end up
in the law or fighting it.

759
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:23,489
That time they tried to kick you out
of St Anselm's and I said,

760
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:27,000
"You will not. We want that child
on the side of the angels."

761
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:30,850
And here you are.

762
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,480
Here you are.

763
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:43,219
Does she treat you well?

764
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,989
Because she was a great
favourite with me.

765
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:48,269
But those forthright ways of hers

766
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:51,449
used to alarm some of the more
sensitive children.

767
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,029
Well, I know my place.
She does the thinking,

768
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:54,420
I do the legwork.

769
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:56,710
Ma'am!

770
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,739
I'm sorry.
Duty calls.

771
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,509
Of course,
but come and see me.

772
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:05,109
And bring your sergeant.

773
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:08,390
He'll want to know about
all your escapades.

774
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,850
We've been trying to reach you.
It's Billy. He's found something.

775
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:29,539
It's not something we
routinely screen for.

776
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,049
You need to be looking.

777
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:33,989
It didn't occur to me until
you asked if he could have
got that injury himself.

778
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:35,559
And there it is.

779
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,649
Causes visual disturbances,
unsteady gait, hallucinations.

780
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,749
Could be arguing
with someone who's not there?

781
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,229
Very possibly fighting them as well.

782
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:47,289
According to tradition
makes you hot as a hare,

783
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,999
blind as a bat,
dry as a bone,

784
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,749
mad as a hatter.

785
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:54,239
-And you're sure?
-Absolutely 100%, copper bottom.

786
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,150
Anything else you want to throw at it -
Gideon Frane was poisoned.

787
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:08,669
Atropine -
comes from deadly nightshade.

788
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:12,809
And in the quantity Gideon Frane
was given would have proved fatal.

789
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,480
If he hadn't drowned first.

790
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:17,429
-Do we know how he took it?
-Well, it's bitter.

791
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:21,119
So it must have been disguised. There
was tonic water and vodka in the yurt.

792
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,959
They're checking both to see
if either might have been the source.

793
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,029
He would have been confused,
possibly hallucinating.

794
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:31,349
Comes out of the yurt,
shouting and thrashing about.

795
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:34,229
Kicks the lamp, catches fire...

796
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:38,969
and then terrified and burning,
jumps off the cliff into the water.

797
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:40,779
Hold on,
if someone got into his tent

798
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,579
to spike a bottle of vodka,
they could have done that anytime.

799
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,629
So all bets are off as far
as alibis are concerned.

800
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:49,769
So does that mean
we're bringing in Kit O'Dowd again?

801
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,480
Do you know what?

802
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:54,090
I just don't fancy him for it.

803
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:58,999
But I tell you who has got
qualifications in chemistry,

804
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,009
and God knows what else
plastered all over her walls...

805
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:05,080
-Dr. Ripman.
-Dr. Ripman.

806
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:12,599
Now, Gideon Frane,
Manda Adelaide,

807
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,410
Jamie Levinson,
and Doctor Ripman.

808
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:19,989
Now there's something connecting
these four.

809
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:22,570
Maybe to do with school, maybe not.

810
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:25,460
Now,
these two aren't talking.

811
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,220
He can't talk.

812
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,420
So I'd say the man
we need to find...

813
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,590
is him.

814
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:41,189
I'm here to advise you
that we're no longer looking at you

815
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:43,490
in connection with the death of
Gideon Frane.

816
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:47,150
And they sent you
all the way here to tell me that?

817
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:53,090
Look, I came on the hard man telling
you we wanted to question you again.

818
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:55,390
I just...

819
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,419
wanted to put
the record straight.

820
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,309
So...
this is an apology?

821
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,429
Hey.
Not from me, son!

822
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:05,589
I'm not the one making the personal
comments.

823
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:09,090
And, by the way, this is a quality
home product.

824
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:13,409
-Sit down.
-Eh?

825
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:15,970
I'm not letting you walk out of here
like this.

826
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,590
Somebody might think I did it.

827
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:30,190
I've found him.

828
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:34,030
I've found him!
Jamie Levinson, I've found him!

829
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:41,950
Dr. Ripman said he'd done time
in Acklington for drugs.

830
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:45,070
She was wrong about the prison,
or she was lying.

831
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:47,489
But she was right
about the offence.

832
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:49,789
His record said
he was trying to come clean.

833
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,100
So I went round all the drugs
rehab charities

834
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:53,950
until I found him.

835
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,990
Thinking and legwork.

836
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:11,300
"Golden lads and girls..."

837
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,750
-You know it's about death.
-What is?

838
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,290
Mr. Levinson!

839
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,109
"Golden lads and girls
must all

840
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:37,130
"as chimney sweepers come to dust."

841
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,010
I looked it up.

842
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:45,560
-They use it at funerals.
-Mr. Levinson!

843
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,350
It's boarded up.

844
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,390
People kept breaking in so I nailed
it.

845
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,650
You have to come in the back.

846
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:05,410
Gideon?

847
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:07,710
Jesus.

848
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:27,290
I'm not supposed to be drinking.

849
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,189
Jesus.

850
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:36,790
-You hadn't heard, then?
-No.

851
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:40,650
I don't really keep up with things.

852
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:49,090
-Sorry, do you want...?
-No, it's a bit early in the day for me.

853
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,229
Well, thanks.
He's driving.

854
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:56,050
You're all right.
I'll find one.

855
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:03,250
-When was the last time you saw him?
-Gideon?

856
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:07,970
Not for years.
Not since school.

857
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:12,750
Actually, that's what
we wanted to talk to you about.

858
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:15,790
School.
Thanks.

859
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:23,170
Is the boss in?

860
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,959
No, she's out with Joe.
Why?

861
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,520
It's nothing that can't wait.

862
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:37,890
Looking good, Kenny.

863
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:41,550
Well...
I'm a good-looking boy.

864
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:48,549
So you remember nothing?

865
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,749
Is that what you're saying,
nothing at all

866
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:52,859
about your last two
years at school?

867
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:56,480
I've had difficulties...
with substances.

868
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:00,229
Memory problems. Do you remember
attacking Gideon Frane?

869
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,149
Attack?
No.

870
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:07,030
-It was a fight.
-Well, what about?

871
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:10,150
What were you fighting over?

872
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:12,769
I'm sorry, I don't...

873
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:15,030
Did it involve Manda Adelaide?

874
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:21,869
Or is that something else
Dr. Ripman has misled us about?

875
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:23,170
Misled?

876
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:27,910
Well, it was her told us
you went for Gideon.

877
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:31,869
A serious and unprovoked assault.

878
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:33,170
No, I...

879
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:36,989
-Hey, sit down.
-That's bitter.

880
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:38,290
Hey!

881
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:40,970
Bitter.

882
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:43,719
Joe!

883
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,220
Vera.
Vera!

884
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:48,989
Vera, it's OK!

885
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:50,890
It's OK, Vera.
Stay with me.

886
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,389
Vera!

887
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,690
Stay with me.

888
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:57,590
Stay with me!
Vera!

889
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:10,859
24 hours under observation?
I barely touched the bloody stuff.

890
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:13,069
Well,
you collapsed in front of us.

891
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:18,150
Oh, well, apparently,
atropine and angina don't mix.

892
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:21,230
I'm not taking you out of here.

893
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:24,589
It's a poison.
You were poisoned.

894
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:28,409
Look.
Gideon Frane - murder.

895
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:30,659
Jamie Levinson -
attempted murder.

896
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:34,660
I haven't got 24 hours to waste,
sitting in here.

897
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:37,830
Ma'am.

898
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:43,429
Why don't you just give it
a few hours?

899
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:46,060
If you're feeling all right then,
discharge yourself.

900
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:48,960
Drop of water.

901
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,830
It'll be no different.

902
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:58,109
You can run things from in here.

903
01:01:58,110 --> 01:01:59,780
Just say what you need us to do.

904
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,290
Right.

905
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:04,790
Dr. Ripman!

906
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:08,610
Now, she had you down as
the dumb sidekick, so...

907
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:11,890
play up to that.
Get her to lower her guard.

908
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:15,890
See what you can get out of
her about atropine.

909
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:20,390
Anything you can find on Jamie
Levinson.

910
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:22,719
Why is it that someone

911
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,859
whose family has the money
to send him to St Finan,

912
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:28,350
to St Finan's is living in
that sort of squalor?

913
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:31,510
And get Kenny to bring me in a
laptop.

914
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:36,470
Listen, I need to borrow your car.
Are you not done bothering me yet?

915
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:41,229
I'm sorry, I forgot that I came
here in an ambulance with you.

916
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:43,650
So I've left my car up there.

917
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:49,589
Just...

918
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:52,099
I can't stand being fussed over.

919
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,329
Well, give him credit for having the
courage.

920
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:57,100
No one else would dare.

921
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:14,719
I know what it is.
I know how it acts.

922
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,689
At a pinch I could probably
produce it,

923
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:18,650
although I'd have to look up
the method.

924
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,539
Are you suggesting I did?

925
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,349
We just need to check it out.

926
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:25,059
You being a chemist,
having the expertise.

927
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:28,509
I doubt it requires a PhD in organic
chemistry.

928
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:31,089
If street drug traders can
synthesize MDMA,

929
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:33,119
they ought to be able to
produce atropine.

930
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,759
Most of my A level
chemistry class

931
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,069
could probably manage it.

932
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:37,589
The wonders of education.

933
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:41,290
I didn't know what deadly nightshade
looked like until I went on Google Images.

934
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:47,599
So you have no idea why anyone
would want to poison Gideon Frane?

935
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,069
No.

936
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:51,199
-Or Jamie Levinson?
-I'm afraid not.

937
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,539
We spoke to him about
his days at school.

938
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,359
-He didn't seem to remember much.
-I'm sorry,

939
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,409
nothing springs to mind
which might be relevant.

940
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,409
Obviously,
if anything occurs...

941
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:02,610
How would you go about getting a
scholarship to a place like this?

942
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,619
-Aren't you a little old?
-No, my daughter.

943
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,629
-She's bright as a button.
-There's an entrance exam.

944
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:11,689
The school secretary
can give you details.

945
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:13,959
I warn you, competition is fierce.

946
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,649
I bet it is.

947
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:18,239
Other schools would sell their soul

948
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,009
for the kind of results
you get here.

949
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:24,250
Results that are built on hard work
and superlative teaching.

950
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,360
How are you feeling?

951
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:54,970
Bad.

952
01:04:56,270 --> 01:05:00,750
I've had some rough brews
in my time, but that...

953
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:04,870
-Sorry.
-It wasn't your fault.

954
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:08,690
Was it?

955
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:11,430
I don't know how it got there.

956
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:17,770
I haven't even been drinking.

957
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:21,090
Not for weeks.

958
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:26,080
So someone put it there.

959
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:29,810
People come and go.

960
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:33,270
Friends of friends of friends.

961
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,450
I don't always know...

962
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:41,079
So your husband taught at
St Finan's, Mrs. Culvert?

963
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,269
That's how he knew
it was a good school.

964
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:47,680
Always was, but Vivienne Ripman
took it into another league.

965
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,549
Did he ever talk about her,
say what he thought of her?

966
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:51,850
Not really.

967
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:55,660
There's a lot of pressure
on staff and pupils.

968
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:58,709
Colin said he just wanted
to leave it all behind

969
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,150
when he came home.

970
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:03,759
There, that's enough.
I think

971
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,540
just let it take care
of itself for a while.

972
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:12,869
Dad was always the
same about work.

973
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:15,729
Drew a line under it as soon
as he walked in through the door.

974
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:17,990
-What about you?
-Me?

975
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:20,589
No, I'm not the strong,
silent type.

976
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:22,110
My wife can't shut me up.

977
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,139
So what happened to your husband?

978
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:29,169
Car crash.

979
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:32,190
<i>Him and Ruthie.
I was lucky not to lose her too.</i>

980
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:36,770
<i>It must be hard however it happens,
but...</i>

981
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:38,779
when it comes all of a sudden...

982
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:40,479
it must knock you
off your feet.

983
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,810
It's like being hit with a wrecking
ball.

984
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:45,299
There was the kids, I was pregnant

985
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,090
and then Max was born with spina
bifida.

986
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:53,150
-Well, how do you manage?
-I'm not sure I do.

987
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:55,559
But here we all are,
anyway.

988
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,050
You live the life you've got,
don't you?

989
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:00,179
It's not like I'm on my own.

990
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,579
Ruthie takes an awful
lot on her shoulders.

991
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:04,839
And Dad ferrying
the kids around,

992
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,290
making sure they don't go
without treats.

993
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:13,570
I still miss Colin, though.

994
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:17,710
I still miss him.

995
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:26,399
I took your advice.
Waited a couple of hours

996
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,669
and had a chat with
one of the doctors.

997
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,979
Very reasonable young man.

998
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:34,949
Saw my side of the situation...
eventually.

999
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:37,319
There'll be a call from the hospital

1000
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,379
as soon as Jamie Levinson
is fit to be interviewed.

1001
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:40,919
Make sure I hear about it.

1002
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,989
Joe - Dr. Ripman.
What have you got?

1003
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:45,809
Well, nothing on the atropine.

1004
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:47,239
But she got really edgy

1005
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:49,599
when she realised we'd been
speaking to Jamie Levinson.

1006
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,019
And there was something else.

1007
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:53,349
I was firing stuff out there,
playing battleships?

1008
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:55,579
I mentioned the exam results,

1009
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,899
them being top of
the league tables.

1010
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,879
-Yeah, and?
-Well, it definitely hit.

1011
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,369
She just iced over,
you could feel the temperature drop.

1012
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:03,509
But the real find
came afterwards.

1013
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:05,399
You know that school
honours board?

1014
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,149
Well,
next to it there's one for teachers

1015
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,159
that were killed in
service at the school.

1016
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,639
They're mostly during the war,

1017
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:14,149
but one teacher died the same year
that Gideon Frane was Head Boy,

1018
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:17,829
Manda Adelaide tried to kill herself
and Jamie Levinson got expelled.

1019
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:19,130
Yeah?

1020
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:21,780
What's the chronology?

1021
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:24,490
I don't know.
I'm still working on it.

1022
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:27,930
But that teacher was
Ruthie Culvert's dad.

1023
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:31,049
Ma'am?
Sorry.

1024
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:32,859
You asked us to look
at Jamie Levinson.

1025
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:35,609
I've got something. It's not
just the family that have money,

1026
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:38,509
he's personally wealthy.
I mean seriously monied.

1027
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:40,649
Massive annual
income from a trust.

1028
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:44,180
Well, where is it?
The man lives like a sewer rat.

1029
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,719
Can't spend it all on drugs and
alcohol.

1030
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,990
He gives it all away to
a kids' charity.

1031
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:53,469
What charity?

1032
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:57,159
Parada. Helps families affected by
spina bifida.

1033
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,850
Ruthie's brother.

1034
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,020
This isn't a conspiracy.

1035
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:06,490
Jamie, Manda...

1036
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:10,470
This is atonement.

1037
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,950
-You lied to us.
-What?

1038
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:18,699
Didn't want us wasting time

1039
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,489
looking back then for answers -

1040
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,779
you are a liar.

1041
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:26,029
It's all about back then
and you knew it.

1042
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:28,409
Jamie Levinson is in intensive care.

1043
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:30,289
He was poisoned the same way
as Gideon.

1044
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:31,590
No.

1045
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:33,890
No.

1046
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:35,930
No.

1047
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:40,800
You thought... he'd done it.

1048
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:46,429
You thought Jamie killed Gideon.

1049
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,719
I was trying to find him,
to talk to him.

1050
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,129
I wanted him to have the chance
to do the right thing,

1051
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:52,709
to come forward
of his own accord.

1052
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:55,680
If he hadn't, I would have come
to you, I would have told you.

1053
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:58,839
-Told us what?
-Is he going to be all right?

1054
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,070
Told us what?

1055
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:06,010
What?

1056
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:12,129
Seven years ago,
you, Jamie, Gideon Frane

1057
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:15,290
and a teacher called Colin Culvert...

1058
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:18,090
Now, what happened?

1059
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:21,850
It was about results, wasn't it?
It was about exam results.

1060
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:25,830
Gideon cheated.

1061
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:29,960
An A level he was taking a year
early.

1062
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:33,650
Mr. Culvert found out and took it to
the head.

1063
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:38,800
Our year we were...
her creatures.

1064
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:42,489
The first cohort she'd seen
all the way through the school,

1065
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:44,850
A-stars all the way.

1066
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,020
Especially Gideon.

1067
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,419
Maybe she didn't want
to lose his grades

1068
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,109
for the league tables.

1069
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:54,880
Maybe she had her sights set
on a new wing, I don't know.

1070
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:57,630
What, she covered it up?

1071
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,310
Let him get away with it?

1072
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:02,869
After that...

1073
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:06,110
Gideon knew whatever
he did, he was protected.

1074
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:08,779
It's not hard to bully a teacher.

1075
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:10,629
Not if you're popular,
and Gideon was.

1076
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:12,489
Why did you and
Jamie get involved?

1077
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:14,569
You know what it's
like at that age.

1078
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,629
You and your friends against the
world.

1079
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:20,739
We thought Mr. Culvert just had it in
for Gideon, picking on him.

1080
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:23,610
That we were the plucky underdogs
fighting back.

1081
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:27,950
We thought we were the
heroes of the story.

1082
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,030
<i>Mr. Culvert started drinking.</i>

1083
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:36,349
<i>You could smell it on his breath,</i>

1084
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:38,470
<i>in class,
under the mints.</i>

1085
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:40,559
<i>He kept a bottle in his bag</i>

1086
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,619
<i>and we used to top it
up with other things.</i>

1087
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:45,920
<i>You can imagine.</i>

1088
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:49,429
One day after school,
we went back to his classroom

1089
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,080
to collect some
things and...

1090
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:54,059
<i>Gideon started taunting him
about the drinking</i>

1091
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:57,930
<i>and how he was gonna tell the head,
and Mr. Culvert just...</i>

1092
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:01,090
<i>Mr. Culvert just...</i>

1093
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:03,450
<i>just broke.</i>

1094
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:06,510
<i>He started crying.</i>

1095
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:09,239
<i>We'd never seen a
teacher cry before.</i>

1096
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,029
<i>We thought it was funny.</i>

1097
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:13,750
<i>We thought he deserved it
for what he'd done to Gideon.</i>

1098
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:18,390
He crashed on the way home.

1099
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:36,870
I don't even remember
the last thing we said to him.

1100
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:40,009
I remember we were laughing and...

1101
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:42,990
that as were leaving,
there was this noise.

1102
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:45,259
She must have been there
the whole time.

1103
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,690
We just hadn't seen.

1104
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:50,520
-Who?
-His daughter.

1105
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:55,990
The look on her face.
I've seen it since then.

1106
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:58,670
With kids I've worked with.

1107
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:01,190
Anguish.

1108
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:23,690
Mrs. Culvert.

1109
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:26,850
Mary, love.

1110
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:30,730
Now,
when your husband was killed,

1111
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,120
Ruthie was in the car?

1112
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:36,659
She doesn't remember much.

1113
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:37,969
It's probably just as well.

1114
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:41,500
Right. Well, we need to see her,
love. Is she about?

1115
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:44,630
Ruthie!

1116
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:47,549
What's the matter?
Has something happened?

1117
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:50,489
No, just a couple of questions,
love.

1118
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:52,830
Ruthie!
Ruthie!

1119
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,700
She's gone.

1120
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:27,099
Ruthie Culvert.
Intelligence have put out an APW,

1121
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:30,269
so the airports, railways
and ferry ports are aware.

1122
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:32,780
Her photo's also gone out on the
police briefing.

1123
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:37,059
We have officers with Jamie Levinson
at the hospital and with Sister Claire,

1124
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:40,389
who we think could also
be a potential target.

1125
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:42,889
Ruthie Culvert
is now our prime suspect

1126
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:45,359
but she is also young and vulnerable.

1127
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,690
Now, come on.
We want her found.

1128
01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:49,779
What have we got?

1129
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:51,269
A team's talking
to her friends.

1130
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:52,920
We've got trained officers
with her brothers.

1131
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,879
I wanna visit her mam.

1132
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,459
-Why now?
-Ma'am?

1133
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,559
-Her father died seven years ago.
-Why now?

1134
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,869
Opportunity.

1135
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:03,369
The sixth form visiting
the adventure centre.

1136
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:05,559
Ruthie finding out Gideon Frane
was involved.

1137
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,419
She could have
found Gideon Frane

1138
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,779
at any point over
the last seven years.

1139
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:12,209
Maybe at ten she
was too young

1140
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:14,960
to pull off murder,
but 14, 15?

1141
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,979
No, something triggered this.

1142
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:21,650
Something happened.
Something's changed.

1143
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:24,080
What?

1144
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,190
Her hair.

1145
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,459
I meant to say,
it just slipped my mind,

1146
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:29,979
it's just a detail but...

1147
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:33,509
Kit O'Dowd mentioned that
a lot of kids from St Finan's

1148
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:34,819
get their hair done at his salon.

1149
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:37,499
She can never afford their prices.

1150
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,859
Her mam said the granddad
used to help out,

1151
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:42,600
make sure the kids didn't miss out -
maybe it was a treat.

1152
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:44,640
OK.

1153
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:48,319
Get on to the salon.
Check their appointments.

1154
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:51,830
See if there was any chance she could
have heard what Gideon was up to.

1155
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:57,010
So he hounds her father to death.

1156
01:15:58,680 --> 01:15:59,980
Seven years later,

1157
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:03,059
she finds out he's doing
it again to somebody else.

1158
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:05,669
No contrition,
no remorse.

1159
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:09,350
In fact, if anything, the experience
has made him more confident.

1160
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:11,870
He think he's untouchable.

1161
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:16,520
Now, I can see why Ruthie
wouldn't be able to live with that.

1162
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:20,090
-And where's the but?
-Why go for Jamie?

1163
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:23,629
I mean, anyone can see
from looking at the man,

1164
01:16:23,630 --> 01:16:25,860
he never walked
away from that day.

1165
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,679
He's been living a penance every
since.

1166
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,609
The officers interviewing her
friends just checked in - nothing!

1167
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:33,619
Nobody's got a clue
where she might have gone.

1168
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:38,050
Well, someone knows. They might not
realise it, but someone knows.

1169
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:47,179
I already told you.
I don't know where she's gone.

1170
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:50,619
-Mrs. Culvert...
-She couldn't have done this.

1171
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:53,880
I know all parents probably
say this but I know...

1172
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:57,440
Ruthie didn't do this.

1173
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:02,750
Anything at all you can remember
from what happened in that classroom?

1174
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:06,640
Hm? I mean, something else
Ruthie might have seen?

1175
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:10,410
Something her father said?

1176
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:18,690
And she's had absolutely no contact
with you at all?

1177
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,520
No.

1178
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,460
I'm sorry.

1179
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:34,380
It's all right. I know it's not a
social visit.

1180
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:39,280
But I hope you find her - the girl
who's run away.

1181
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,059
Me too.

1182
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:43,539
Remember when you did the same?

1183
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:47,490
Straight out of the head's office
and over the fields and far away.

1184
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:50,779
Poor little mite.

1185
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:53,140
Aye, well, nothing poor about it.

1186
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:58,379
I just didn't fancy the leathering I was
due for not wearing my uniform right.

1187
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:01,959
You still hanging on to that story
after all this time?

1188
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,719
-What?
-It was your father

1189
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,680
went off after those birds.
Left you on your own.

1190
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:10,189
Stayed away longer than he planned,
I suppose.

1191
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:14,860
You'd run out of clean uniform.
You'd run out of everything.

1192
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:18,650
Eating peas out of a can
when I came round.

1193
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:23,040
It wasn't the strap
you were running from.

1194
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:26,650
You just didn't want your dad
getting in trouble.

1195
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,219
-Boss?
<i>-Joe.</i>

1196
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,339
<i>I don't think it is her.</i>

1197
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:50,039
I don't think it's Ruthie.

1198
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,080
I think she's
protecting someone.

1199
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:56,610
<i>Joe, are you there?</i>

1200
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:02,390
<i>-Joe!</i>
-Yeah. No, I'm... still here.

1201
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,810
<i>Just give me a second.</i>

1202
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:11,310
I think I know who.

1203
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,959
After your husband died,
was there a special place

1204
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,970
Ruthie used to go with your dad?

1205
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:01,410
I know it wasn't you.

1206
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:12,480
I'm sorry, pet.

1207
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:16,959
When did you realise...

1208
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,060
it was your granddad?

1209
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:24,680
I think maybe I always knew.

1210
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:29,680
I was just trying not to.

1211
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:36,820
You came asking about what I heard
at the quarry...

1212
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:43,520
and Granddad was walking past
the window.

1213
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:46,290
And I just knew.

1214
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:52,410
There's this hairdresser's
everyone goes to.

1215
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,360
I heard one of them talking.

1216
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:58,840
Crying...

1217
01:21:00,005 --> 01:21:02,310
about Gideon Frane.

1218
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:07,740
-About what he was doing...
-I know, love. I know.

1219
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:15,210
He wouldn't have done
it if I hadn't told him.

1220
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:20,150
But I've always
told him everything.

1221
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:23,510
Ever since Dad...

1222
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:56,419
Would you confirm
for the tape, please,

1223
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:58,760
that you are Ronald Devreux?

1224
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:05,230
25 years,
sitting where you are now.

1225
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:09,370
Retired early to be there for my
daughter.

1226
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,539
And because I couldn't take the
sight of one more smug bastard

1227
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:16,889
walking out of the court
with his finger in the air

1228
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,660
and a swagger in his step.

1229
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:23,139
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm Ronald Devreux

1230
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:25,380
and I killed Gideon Frane.

1231
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:33,539
<i>Tell me about Jamie Levinson.</i>

1232
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:35,299
<i>That was unintentional.</i>

1233
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:38,499
<i>You put a whisky bottle full of
atropine in his cupboard.</i>

1234
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:41,239
<i>For you to find,
not him to drink.</i>

1235
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,619
<i>-Planting evidence.
-Misdirection.</i>

1236
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:46,449
<i>I was hoping if I gave you
a credible enough collar,</i>

1237
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:47,939
<i>you wouldn't look elsewhere.</i>

1238
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,269
<i>That's a bit of a risk</i>

1239
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:51,809
<i>given his history
of substance abuse.</i>

1240
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:53,119
<i>I've got good contacts.</i>

1241
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,689
<i>I had it on good authority
he'd given up drinking.</i>

1242
01:22:55,690 --> 01:22:57,530
<i>The alcohol...</i>

1243
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:00,080
<i>glasses were for methadone.</i>

1244
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:03,359
<i>But that's probation
officers for you,</i>

1245
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,450
<i>a bunch of
bloody optimists.</i>

1246
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:08,249
I knew my son-in-law was having
trouble at work

1247
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:11,460
and from a few hints he dropped,
I had an idea as to why.

1248
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:14,750
After he died,

1249
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,469
and after Ruthie told
me what she'd seen,

1250
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:19,370
I put two and two together.

1251
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:26,939
So, I told Dr. Ripman
I was going to hold her to account.

1252
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:29,469
Go to the governors with
the fact that she'd covered up

1253
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:31,560
Gideon Frane's cheating.

1254
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:34,319
She said if I started muck-raking,

1255
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,549
she said there'd be no death in
service benefit paid out for Colin,

1256
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:39,150
no pension.

1257
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:47,480
He...
He was drunk at the wheel.

1258
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:54,699
And... the small print, you know,
I'd managed to bury that

1259
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:58,480
as far as the inquest went, but she
knew.

1260
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:01,660
So there we both were.

1261
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,680
Each pointing a gun
at the other's head.

1262
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,559
And Ruthie's scholarship?

1263
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,439
She got that with
her own brain.

1264
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,179
She was only ten
when it happened

1265
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:13,739
She didn't know
the full story

1266
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:16,139
She didn't know what Dr. Ripman had
done.

1267
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:18,210
Her mother doesn't know anything.

1268
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:22,100
Interview rooms.

1269
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:26,260
Stale air and bad coffee.
I miss it.

1270
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:34,770
Interview formally concluded at
21:19.

1271
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,329
Thank you for your cooperation.

1272
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:43,880
I have no interest in fighting these
charges.

1273
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:46,620
I won't be standing trial.

1274
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:52,250
-Contacts?
-Cigarettes.

1275
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,980
Pack-a-day man most of my life.

1276
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,379
Six months, they said.

1277
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:02,850
And you and I both know that with the
criminal justice system in this country,

1278
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:06,480
it will be twice that before this
gets near a court.

1279
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:10,249
Yeah, they gave me
the news the same day

1280
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:12,560
I picked Ruthie up
from the hairdresser's.

1281
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:15,960
It felt like kismet.

1282
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:20,810
And you thought this would help them
after you've gone?

1283
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:25,659
They didn't need it.
You did.

1284
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:27,920
Don't you sometimes want it?

1285
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:31,190
-Justice?
-It wasn't justice.

1286
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:36,160
That was murder.
And yes, sometimes I do.

1287
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:40,290
But I wouldn't want to live in
a world that would let me take it.

1288
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,500
-Where is everyone?
-Gone to the pub.

1289
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:00,129
Why don't you come?

1290
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:01,840
Kenny's bringing his new woman.

1291
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:04,480
Someone should warn her.

1292
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:09,459
No, you're all right...
I've got plans.

1293
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:11,080
Paperwork, you know?

1294
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:16,849
I'm glad you're settling so well,
fitting in.

1295
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:19,060
Well, it's a good team,
good atmosphere.

1296
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:22,760
Comes from the top.

1297
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,630
-Here you are.
-Cheers, mate.

1298
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:27,600
Ah, you beauty.

1299
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,960
Shep!
Hey.

1300
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,100
Hey, darling.

1301
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:35,259
-Shep, this is Lindsey.
-Nice to meet you.

1302
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:36,569
Lindsey, Shep.

1303
01:27:36,570 --> 01:27:38,619
-What do you want to drink?
-Gin and tonic, please.

1304
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,920
Gin and tonic, please, as well.

1305
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:06,560
Vera?

1306
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:13,050
Vera Stanhope!

1307
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:22,240

<i>An occasion such as this
SIX MONTH LATER</i>

3
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,670
<i>is always one of
conflicting emotions,</i>

4
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,590
<i>as we celebrate the safe
return of our comrades</i>

5
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,840
<i>and the honours that they
have gained in the field.</i>

6
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,050
<i>We also remember the
injured and the fallen.</i>

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,170
Shine up the old silver,
looking good, looking sexy!

8
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,950
Ladies and gentlemen - the
Royal Ordnance Fusiliers.

9
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,580
Has anybody seen the enemy?

10
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,190
Light House, 500m, rapid fire!

11
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,420
Move!

12
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,970
Here you are, boss.
Have some rounds.

13
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,380
- Take that, Terry Taliban!
- This one's for Ollie!

14
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,070
Charge!

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,170
Man down! Man down!

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,190
# Wanna go home!

17
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,190
# Let me go home

18
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,750
# Let me...
# Let me go home

19
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,230
Yeah! Yeah!

20
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,870
# I feel so broke up

21
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,750
# I wanna go home

22
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,230
I hope he hasn't decided to stay.

23
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,870
Two tours of Afghan? Not likely.

24
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,230
Come here.

"Sandancers"
Morning.

28
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,640
No.

29
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,890
No, they can be
awkward buggers.

30
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,060
Listen, call Joe. Tell him
I'll pick him up on the way.

31
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,440
- You did it?
- Aye.

32
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,260
- How much?
- A pound.

33
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,250
That's what we used to get, Joe.

34
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,060
Yeah, well, inflation hasn't
hit the fairy world yet.

35
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,170
Go, then. Go to your other woman.

36
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,720
Babe, I'm between a
rock and a hard place.

37
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,220
Well, I hope I'm the rock.

38
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,370
- Hi, Vera.
- Celine.

39
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,330
Mum, Mum, the tooth fairy
forgot to take the tooth!

40
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,220
She'll come back for it, pet.

41
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,560
Well, I wouldn't worry about it. She
was going to find out sooner or later.

42
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,150
Breakfast?

43
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,250
It's an army death. You'd have thought
military police would handle it themselves.

44
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,730
Boy soldiers playing at policemen.

45
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,250
Fine at banging up a couple of
drunk squaddies on a Saturday night.

46
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,360
But unexplained deaths...

47
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,390
out of their league.

48
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,800
Isn't it their case, though,
if it happens on military property?

49
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,090
Aye. Letter of the
law, you're right.

50
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,240
But what happens in reality

51
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,190
is we both do what we're good at.

52
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,190
We do the investigating, and they
do the marching and the saluting.

53
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,460
Excuse me, sir.

54
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,700
- Captain Shepherd, SIB.
- Vera Stanhope.

55
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,620
- Chief Inspector, ma'am.
- DS Ashworth.

56
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,240
- Joe.
- Most people call me Shep.

57
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,030
And this is Lieutenant Colonel Chapell,
CO of the regiment.

58
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,770
Detective Chief Inspector,
welcome to Otterford.

59
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,520
A suicide, of course,
is bad for morale.

60
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,340
So we're grateful to
you for your assistance.

61
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,640
Let's hope we can resolve this
as soon as possible.

62
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,990
If you need anything, please ask.

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,110
In the meantime, I leave you in
Captain Shepherd's capable hands.

64
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,230
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel.

65
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,040
And as soon as we've established
that the unexplained death is a suicide,

66
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,830
you'll be the first to know.

67
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,190
Right, Shep.

68
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,130
Staff Sergeant James Deverson.

69
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,870
Everyone called him Dev.

70
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,180
RLC, Military Cross.

71
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,280
He was EOD. Sorry, ma'am, bomb disposal.

72
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,880
Two tours to Afghanistan, and Iraq
before that. Recently returned.

73
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,690
Military Cross?

74
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,000
That's a big deal, isn't it?

75
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,310
Aye, you got to the Palace for it.

76
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,090
He was down there only
last week.

77
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,700
- So where is it?
- He would have been wearing it last night.

78
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,100
- Anyone come across this medal?
- No, not yet, ma'am.

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,690
- Family?
- Married. Two kids.

80
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,390
- Were they...?
- No, they live off with the wife's mother.

81
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,160
- Weapon?
- It's a Browning, 9mm.

82
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,780
Standard army issue.

83
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,780
It's got a silencer on it,
so he didn't want to be heard.

84
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,750
- His?
- We don't carry weapons outside of theatre.

85
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,980
He had to have checked
it out of the armoury.

86
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,190
- No note?
- None we've found, ma'am.

87
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,140
There might be something on that.

88
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,830
Have someone bag it up.

89
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,580
Who discovered him?

90
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,760
A new-minted sergeant
out of Catterick.

91
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,400
He was supposed to move in with
his wife and baby this morning.

92
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,150
What, he was... shipping out again?

93
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,270
He was hanging up his boots.

94
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,330
15 years. His last
night on barracks.

95
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,920
Nice-looking lass.

96
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,580
The wife?

97
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,170
I'm afraid I'm not
long in Otterford.

98
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,290
Sorry, didn't hear my alarm.

99
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,450
Well, you have to
wake up in your own bed

100
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,210
to hear the alarm, Billy!

101
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,550
Better suit up.

102
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,980
Right, thoughts?

103
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,300
He's an armaments officer.

104
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,650
They know how to get
access to all the equipment.

105
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,400
It looks like suicide.

106
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,530
After making it alive through a
couple of tours to Afghanistan?

107
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,450
Afghan affects people
in different ways, ma'am.

108
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,740
You see it here, when they come back.
Leaves its mark.

109
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,460
Ma'am.

110
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,190
- Looks like a squat.
- Aye, it's a bit grim, isn't it?

111
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,630
Billy's got something
for you downstairs.

112
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,890
It smells in here.

113
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,850
Get Forensics to check
for traces of vomit.

114
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,630
No, it's too low.

115
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,210
Look, if I'm going to shoot myself...

116
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
firstly, I'm tense, so
I'm sitting up straight.

117
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,030
Second, I want my wrist behind the shot
because of the recoil.

118
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,850
So I hold it lower, shoot upwards.

119
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,470
Now, look at him.

120
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,640
Exit wound is too low.
It's the base of the skull.

121
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,450
<i>But if he was asleep,</i>

122
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,050
head back, mouth half
open, like he was found...

123
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,730
And someone else shot
him through the mouth.

124
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,330
You think he was murdered?

125
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,080
It's too like
a suicide...

126
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,620
to be a suicide.

127
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,440
State of shock.

128
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,030
I said I'd drive her home in a bit.

129
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,730
- Where's Shep?
- Getting the rest of the Sandancers together.

130
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,240
- The what?
- Dev's bomb team.

131
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,460
"Sandancer" must have
been their call sign.

132
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,350
Must have been a Shields lad, eh?

133
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,760
She said she'd meet us
up the mess up the way.

134
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,090
Right.

135
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,110
Get the statements
first, then the gun.

136
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,500
Get Shep to take
you to the armoury.

137
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,190
You'll be like a kid
in a sweetie shop.

138
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,180
Ma'am.

139
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,650
Morning. Thanks for coming.

140
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,150
This is Detective
Chief lnspector Stanhope

141
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,990
of the Northumberland and City CID.

142
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,880
- Ma'am.
- Captain.

143
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,520
I expect some of you have heard

144
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,830
that Staff Sergeant Deverson
died early this morning.

145
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,710
Initially, his death was
thought to be a suicide...

146
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,540
but we now have reason to
believe he was murdered.

147
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,730
So, which of you were with
Staff Sergeant Deverson

148
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,210
after the meal last night?

149
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,570
Come on, show of hands.

150
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,670
So after the fireworks at
the Collingwood Memorial?

151
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,290
- Back to camp.
- What time?

152
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,990
I thought you liked
real men, ma'am.

153
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,750
He's a bit boy band, is he not?

154
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,270
Answer Sergeant Ashworth's
question, Corporal Grafton.

155
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,890
I don't know what time. Why
don't you check with front gate?

156
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,390
So you'd been drinking
since the meal?

157
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,990
And what makes you
think we only began then?

158
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,100
And what happened after?

159
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,730
- We all came home.
- Together?

160
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,510
- I don't remember.
- No, after the fireworks?

161
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,910
Yeah, I remember heading
over to the fireworks.

162
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,770
So how did you get home after?

163
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,750
Did Dev and Vince take you back?

164
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,290
We all signed in.
Then said our goodbyes.

165
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,670
What about Budgie?

166
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,300
He could hardly
stand. Poor bastard.

167
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,110
Where did you wake up
this morning, Budgie?

168
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,350
The block. My own bed.

169
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,730
You can't remember getting there?

170
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,290
It always makes me feel
that little bit calmer.

171
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,180
I read once it's the positive ions

172
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,520
generated by the pounding
of the waves. But...

173
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,490
I think it's the wind.

174
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,830
Blows the cobwebs out of your head.

175
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,290
I don't know what to think.

176
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,610
First the chaplain came, saying

177
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,030
he's shot himself,
and then you say...

178
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,290
You weren't with your
husband last night?

179
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,740
But I thought it was
a celebration dinner,

180
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,440
to welcome the lads home?

181
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,390
An army thing. Not for wives.

182
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,120
- So where were you?
- Home.

183
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,750
You can ask my mum.

184
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,620
- You don't think that I had anything...?
- No.

185
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,550
But I have to ask, pet.

186
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,410
You don't like it at the
barracks much, do you?

187
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,840
It's just with him being away
on tour so much, we felt...

188
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,810
it would be better if
I stayed with my mum.

189
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,620
And it's better for the kids

190
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,020
not to be surrounded by
it all at the barracks.

191
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,290
But this time he was home for good?

192
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,010
I've longed for that
for years, and now...

193
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,110
And there weren't any problems?

194
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,490
With anyone in the regiment or his team,
I mean?

195
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,540
No. Not that I know of. Why?

196
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,530
What about in Afghanistan?

197
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,030
He didn't like to talk
about out there and I...

198
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,650
I didn't want to know.

199
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,750
- Letters?
- Well, it's emails now.

200
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,990
But he was never much for writing.

201
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,290
When he had his soldier
head on, which was 24/7,

202
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,310
there's not much time for family.

203
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,300
Joe?

204
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,190
Right, I'm on my way.

205
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,380
The Browning 9mm is standard army

206
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,690
issue since the Second World War

207
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,460
but they're being
decommissioned in batches.

208
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,460
The one that killed Deverson
should've been done eight months ago.

209
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,420
So someone
took it instead?

210
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,750
Yeah.

211
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,250
- What am I looking at?
- The officer that signed it out.

212
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,680
James Deverson?

213
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,850
He'd have known it
would be decommissioned.

214
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,120
So it must've got lost
in the bureaucracy.

215
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,790
Excuse me.

216
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,290
What about forensics?

217
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,270
- Prints on the gun?
- Yeah, only Deverson's.

218
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,490
So the killer knew he had the gun.

219
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,270
Knew not to leave
prints on it, obviously.

220
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,380
Silencer?

221
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,720
Not army issue,

222
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,430
not according to the
armaments officer.

223
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,870
Home-made or modified. Expertly done.

224
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,910
But something an ATO like
Deverson would know how to make?

225
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,290
What about the team?

226
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:30,020
Corporal Vincent Grafton.
He's not giving anything away.

227
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,750
Lance Corporal O'Connor
claims that he drank so much

228
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,490
he blacked out and
can't remember a thing.

229
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,880
That's fortuitous.

230
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,560
Shep checked with
the front-gate log.

231
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,050
He signed in with Dev
at 10 past midnight.

232
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,610
As for the others, didn't
hear or see anything.

233
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,550
Did you get prints and swabs?

234
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,980
Ma'am.

235
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,760
Lieutenant Colonel Chapell.

236
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,610
He's right, we've nothing.

237
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,690
Nothing from his men,
nothing from the wife.

238
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,590
The only prints on the gun they
appropriated from the armoury are his.

239
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,130
He seems very keen for us
to believe it's suicide.

240
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,170
There's a lot riding
on Billy's theory.

241
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,980
It's not a theory, it's a fact.

242
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,820
You did tell him I'm a
pathologist, not a homeopath?

243
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,970
Besides, what's he going
to threaten you with?

244
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,910
You're outside his
bailiwick, aren't you?

245
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,250
Outside everyone's.

246
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,020
But he can still make
things difficult.

247
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,380
Here.

248
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,750
- What's that?
- Little present. Front tooth.

249
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,180
Most of it, at least.
Found it in the back of the

250
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,990
victim's head. If you were
going to do it yourself,

251
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,450
you wouldn't shoot yourself
through half-closed teeth.

252
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,190
So what are you saying?

253
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,030
Deverson conks on the bed, still in
his full formal gear from the meal.

254
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,570
Middle of the night,
gets up, vomits,

255
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,250
comes downstairs
for a glass of water,

256
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,150
sits in the chair to
stop the world spinning?

257
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,210
Forensics confirmed there were
traces of vomit in the bedroom.

258
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,010
Yeah, but Deverson didn't vomit.

259
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,380
Had half a keg of beer in
his gut when we opened him up.

260
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,140
Had to mop the place clean after.

261
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,220
And here's me thinking you'd
been partying in the morgue again.

262
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,170
So there was someone else
in the house with him?

263
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,160
Put that down, Kenny.

264
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,240
This is an incident
room, not a greasy spoon.

265
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,700
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a visitor.

266
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,410
Captain Shepherd from Her
Majesty's Royal Military Police

267
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,040
is going to assist us
in our investigations.

268
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,500
Now...

269
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,010
Staff Sergeant James Deverson,
known to everyone as Dev.

270
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,070
Recently awarded the Military Cross.

271
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,240
Speaking of which, any sign yet?

272
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,280
No, nothing in the
scene-of-crime report.

273
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,930
Now, the killer
wanted us to believe

274
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,900
he'd committed suicide. Why?

275
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,410
Make him look like a coward.

276
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,710
Personally, I think
it takes some courage.

277
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,780
But the common view, of which you
are the proud possessor, Kenny,

278
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,750
is that it is cowardly.
What is that?

279
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,210
That's the high-speed
broadband upgrades

280
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,840
we're crying out for, ma'am.

281
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,010
Well, I'm sure it's going to assist
greatly with all your tweeting, Kenny.

282
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,380
But would someone
tell 'em to shut up?

283
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,580
Now, then...

284
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,960
he was killed with a handgun

285
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,010
that Deverson himself signed out

286
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,590
of the garrison armoury.

287
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,180
So who would want him dead?

288
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,590
Wife - Laura? Motive?

289
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,730
Him never being around.

290
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,520
So why kill him when
he finally comes back?

291
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,800
Playing away from home
as well as working.

292
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,250
He was clutching her
photo, when he died.

293
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,760
No, she seemed
genuinely distraught,

294
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,530
plus her mother confirmed

295
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,850
she was at home that night.

296
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,510
What about members of his team?

297
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,690
Vince Grafton, his infantry escort,

298
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,540
Dev's bodyguard
when he was defusing.

299
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,130
Lance Corporal Kevin O'Connor.

300
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,920
Fusilier, point man to
the team, nicknamed Budgie.

301
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,890
Now, both of them had
a skinful that night.

302
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,010
Grafton claims they came
back around midnight,

303
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,290
said their goodbyes. He
went back to his block.

304
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,260
Budgie doesn't remember a thing.

305
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,070
But the traces of vomit tell us

306
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,640
there was someone in the
house with him that night.

307
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,780
Did you get Forensics to
cross check with their samples?

308
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,940
Aye. They said they'll
try their best, boss.

309
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,180
But, apparently, there's
a variety of DNAs in vomit.

310
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,630
Depends on what you put in.

311
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,410
Thanks for that!

312
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,890
Did either of you
get any sense that

313
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,390
any of them held any
grudges against him?

314
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,770
All the soldiers I spoke to
yesterday seemed to respect him,

315
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,180
look up to him, even.

316
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,790
Vince, I don't know whether
it's his soldier's code,

317
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,100
keep it in the family
sort of thing, but

318
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,900
Vince did say that Dev could
be a mean bastard sometimes.

319
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,950
- Meaning?
- He clammed up after that.

320
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,260
Said he meant nothing by it.

321
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,570
They were all under
stress out there.

322
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,990
Did you check Deverson's
military record?

323
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,940
Yeah. It's exemplary.

324
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,790
Does it say what he got
the Military Cross for?

325
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,820
Heroism under enemy fire.

326
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,350
His team were lured into a trap.

327
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,140
His second in command Oliver
Barton triggered an IED.

328
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,060
It was pressure released.
He was blown up.

329
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,290
Dev had to defend his
team from the Taliban,

330
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,640
extract his comrade's body

331
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,750
and his men without
further casualties.

332
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,330
There's a full report here from

333
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,640
Lieutenant Colonel
Chapell, CO at Otterford.

334
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,150
Brave man.

335
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,250
Any of the team mention
this Oliver Barton?

336
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,760
No.

337
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,500
Did you know him, Shep?

338
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,350
No, I'm only in the
post a few months.

339
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,920
Right, Kenny, I want
checks on Vince Grafton

340
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,765
and this Budgie O'Connor.

341
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,470
Shep, I want background
on this Oliver Barton.

342
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,240
I want the logbook
from the front gate,

343
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,960
CCTV tapes from the
night before last.

344
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,750
I want a list of everyone who went
in or came out of the barracks.

345
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,700
Joe, any mention of
next of kin for Barton?

346
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,010
Yeah, there is.

347
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,590
- I want someone to talk to them.
- Me, ma'am.

348
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,190
Good.
Where are they?

349
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,820
The Cadvar Estate.
He's the estate manager there.

350
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,850
- What, the Cadvar?
- Yeah.

351
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,280
Do you know it?

352
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,720
Years back.

353
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,640
I'll tell you what,
we'll take this one, Joe.

354
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,650
- Sorry, pet.
- Ma'am.

355
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,590
Thanks.

356
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,980
Kenny, Deverson's laptop.

357
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,040
Emails..See if there was
anything going on in Afghanistan.

358
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,520
Bullying, that sort of thing.

359
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,790
And see if he was carrying
on, like you suggest.

360
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,380
Password?

361
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,410
No, that's what the detective part

362
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,000
of detective
constable means, Kenny.

363
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,570
Significant dates, kids'
names, anything at all.

364
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,580
Come on, we've got work to do.

365
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,030
Keith and Diana Barton.

366
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,290
He's a former sergeant major
in the Royal Ordnance Fusiliers.

367
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,570
He retired from the
regiment 15 years ago.

368
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,610
Now he runs shooting
parties on the estate.

369
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,670
So how is it you
know this place again?

370
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,570
Was it coming to balls
here when you were a lass?

371
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,490
My dad, he had a bit of a racket
going with the shoot manager.

372
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,120
Must be this Barton.

373
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,950
Whenever he spotted
a peregrine's or a

374
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,260
goshawk's nest, he'd call my dad.

375
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,950
Up he'd come and take the eggs,
and the young, if there were any.

376
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,240
Why did he want to
get rid of them?

377
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,520
Birds of prey pick off the
chicks they breed for the shoot.

378
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,830
Old bugger made me
turn a blind eye.

379
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,060
Up you get, up! Good girls.

380
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,970
- Mr. Barton?
- A moment.

381
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,550
Blanking in the woods
before tomorrow's shoot.

382
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,630
Stop the birds straying.

383
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,620
DCI Vera Stanhope.

384
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,020
Stanhope?

385
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,900
- Anything to...?
- Aye, daughter.

386
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,380
So the poacher's
girl's a gamekeeper.

387
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,310
Better watch what
I say!

388
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,100
Actually, we're here to talk
about Oliver, your son.

389
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,750
Have you got a minute?

390
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,360
The day he got his
tapes at Otterford.

391
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,210
Thank you, Mrs. Barton.
You shouldn't have.

392
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,150
It's Diana, please. It's nothing.

393
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,320
You served with the Royal
Ordnance Fusiliers too,

394
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,630
Mr. Barton, out of Otterford?

395
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,720
- I did my time.
- He's being modest.

396
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,770
Rose to sergeant
major, didn't you, sir?

397
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,180
Thanks.

398
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,230
And you still retain
links with the regiment?

399
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,020
Cut off my leg, and you'd see

400
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,690
Royal Ordnance Fusiliers
written right through me.

401
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,120
So you would have been at the
dinner the night before last?

402
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,770
Oh, we wouldn't miss it.

403
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,220
It was our chance to, you
know... remember Ollie.

404
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,370
Well, you've sacrificed more than most.

405
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,070
Yes. Yes, we have.

406
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,710
Did you come straight home after?

407
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,620
We went to Dominic's
for a nightcap. Why?

408
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,230
- Dominic?
- Lieutenant Colonel Chapell.

409
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,770
I was his platoon
sergeant on his first tour.

410
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,840
He was fresh out of Sandhurst.

411
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,020
I thought you wanted
to talk about Ollie.

412
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,290
I'm afraid to have to
tell you that yesterday

413
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,470
the body of your son's immediate
superior, James Deverson,

414
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,860
was found at the barracks.

415
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:56,050
Well, as I said, I am - we
are - close to Dominic.

416
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,750
He called me yesterday. Deverson
was Ollie's colleague, after all.

417
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,150
Which is why I want to talk
to you about Ollie's death.

418
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,230
- It's a needless bloody waste!
- Keith, please.

419
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,310
He did stand on an IED,
didn't he, Mr. Barton?

420
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,980
And then Deverson extracted his body
and the team?

421
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,390
That's what they gave
him the MC for, wasn't it?

422
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,370
You don't think that
is what happened?

423
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,230
How can we know
what happened?

424
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,140
Now Deverson's dead too,
what more can we tell you?

425
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,580
We weren't there, were we?

426
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,870
No, I understand that, and I'm sorry
to have brought it all back to you.

427
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,910
It's not like it ever goes away.

428
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,760
I'll see you out.

429
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,020
Thanks.

430
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,500
- So it's a big shoot?
- Two days.

431
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,540
- Your guns?
- The estate's.

432
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,790
Don't worry, they're all
registered and licensed.

433
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,410
Just giving them the
once-over before tomorrow.

434
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,520
They must be big
business, these shoots.

435
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,080
It helps maintain the place,
keeps some of us employed.

436
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,880
This one's private, for His
Lordship and his friends.

437
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,240
I'd better get those dogs up there,

438
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,740
so there are still
birds to shoot at,

439
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,380
make sure there's
enough game for them

440
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,720
to feel like the last of
the great white hunters.

441
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,430
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye.

442
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,090
Thanks, Mr. Barton.

443
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,650
So how come you know
so much about the army?

444
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,850
I used to love everything to do
with the army when I was a kid.

445
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,660
It seemed like a way out.

446
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,530
Why didn't you choose
that as a career?

447
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,110
Celine.

448
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,960
Imagine her letting me go to
Afghanistan six months at a time!

449
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,640
Their loss!

450
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,570
Now, get Shep to check
their alibis with Chapell.

451
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,050
And Laura Deverson told us
the dinner wasn't for wives.

452
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,480
Is the Provo about?

453
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,980
<i>Yeah, he's around.
I'll give him a ring.</i>

454
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,290
Right.

455
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,870
Laura 2000. Dev's email.

456
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,990
He married Laura in 2000.

457
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,910
You're not just a
pretty face, then, Kenny.

458
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,110
- What does it tell us?
- Now, that's the problem.

459
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,100
It's mainly spam, phishing scams.

460
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,910
He didn't seem to
use it much, though.

461
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,580
Only the emails, that is.

462
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,090
Don't think you
can get all lads mag

463
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,050
just cos Holly's no longer here.

464
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,550
Is there nothing to his wife, even?

465
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,005
No, EOD, boss.

466
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,560
- Explosive Ordnance?
- No, no, no.

467
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,870
"Everyone's divorced."

468
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,770
It's an army joke Shep told us.

469
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,850
Oh, telling each other
jokes now, are we?

470
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,800
Just because he's not
emailing his missus

471
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,110
doesn't mean they're
getting a divorce.

472
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,880
It's not like he's
emailing anybody else.

473
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,150
Maybe he didn't have
high-speed broadband.

474
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,980
Well, you'd better check, see if
there's any sign of divorce proceedings.

475
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,350
Solicitors, banks,
that sort of thing.

476
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,380
Boss? Turns out there were
traces of blood in that vomit.

477
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,100
From an ulcer.

478
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,540
They've got a match?

479
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,940
Budgie!

480
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,480
You need to put that beer
down, Budgie, and come with me.

481
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,210
Do you understand why
you're here, Kevin?

482
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,560
- Kevin, do you understand?
- Don't call me that.

483
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,790
OK.
Budgie.

484
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,840
How did you come by a name like that?

485
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,520
Dev said I was like
a canary down a mine.

486
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,090
If my Val started tweeting.

487
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,150
- Your what?
- Vallon.

488
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,790
Metal detector.

489
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,070
So you went out in front,
did you, looking for lEDs?

490
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,810
So why didn't he call you Canary?

491
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,270
Because I'm a Fusilier.

492
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,960
Nicknamed the Budgies
because of our dress hats.

493
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,100
Typical British army, Dev said,

494
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,410
always messing up on equipment.

495
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,610
"They send me a budgie
instead of a canary."

496
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,900
Have an ulcer, Budgie?

497
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,190
Only you told my sergeant here

498
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,690
you couldn't remember what
happened the night before last.

499
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,170
But we found vomit
with traces of blood,

500
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,870
your blood, at Dev's house.

501
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,600
So do you remember going back to Dev's?

502
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,520
Well, what were you doing there?

503
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,410
I asked, Budgie, what
you were doing there.

504
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,150
I want to confess to the murder of
Staff Sergeant James Deverson, ma'am.

505
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,040
After the dinner, we
went out on the piss.

506
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,140
Drinking all day. Been
like that since Afghan.

507
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,970
Need to knock myself out.

508
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,690
But out at them fireworks,
the legs went from under me.

509
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,420
And then what?

510
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,830
- And then Dev took me home.
- His home?

511
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,680
Gave me some tabs... to help me sleep.

512
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,490
He had trouble and
all himself like that.

513
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,970
Said for me to take the bed.
Said he didn't use it any more.

514
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,530
Then the next thing I know I'm
come to and I'm staring at Dev,

515
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,180
and he's shot through the head.

516
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,870
And I know it's me that's done it.

517
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,250
But it looked like suicide.

518
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,360
You knew he had a gun?

519
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,960
Some lads bring mementos
back from Afghan.

520
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,770
His gun was army issue, Budgie.

521
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,900
I mean, they have
kit, their own kit.

522
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,100
- What about the silencer?
- What do you want from me?

523
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,650
I did it! I shot him, I
took his gun and I shot him.

524
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,950
What, you don't think I'm capable?

525
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,260
And then I made it
look like suicide,

526
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,620
just like you said, and then
I scarpered, back to my block.

527
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,540
Dev rated you. You
did two tours together.

528
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,870
But he could be hard on
you, Budgie, couldn't he?

529
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,880
Cos sometimes I messed up.

530
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,190
That why you killed him?

531
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,790
We wouldn't have all
got through without Dev.

532
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,940
But you didn't all
get through, did you?

533
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,030
Ollie didn't make it.

534
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,010
We're just trying to
understand why you killed him.

535
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,490
You talk like he was
a second father to you.

536
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,450
Was it because he was leaving the army?

537
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,090
Leaving you?

538
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,050
- You take his medal, his Military Cross?
- No.

539
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,620
- Not even as a memento?
- No,

540
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,420
I didn't mind his
leaving. OK?

541
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,810
What about Ollie?

542
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,030
What about Ollie's death?

543
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,820
Did you blame Dev for that?

544
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,900
No.

545
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,520
No, that was my fault.

546
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,490
It was me that got Ol killed.

547
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,490
Ollie! Ollie!

548
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,570
<i>Dev was the hero.</i>

549
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,830
<i>He got us and Ollie's body out of there.</i>

550
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,950
I didn't spot them other lEDs.

551
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,230
I told him that the path was clear.

552
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,260
Ma'am, Chapell's confirmed

553
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,700
the Bartons were with
him till about 1:45am.

554
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,430
Right. Kenny, has Billy
confirmed time of death?

555
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,550
Between 1 and 2am, ma'am.

556
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,370
And I checked CCTV. The Bartons'
car left barracks at 1:48am.

557
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,070
What about Chapell himself?

558
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,270
He's the commanding officer, ma'am.

559
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,060
Well, no-one's above
suspicion, Shep.

560
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,080
But I thought we
had our man anyway.

561
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,920
Found at the crime scene.
Valium. 10 grain.

562
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,320
There was enough Valium in
the vomit to knock out a horse.

563
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,950
And as you know, Dev was
long dead before dawn.

564
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,460
What are you thinking?

565
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,480
I'm thinking whatever
Budgie's done,

566
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,540
or thinks he's done,

567
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,250
he didn't do this.

568
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,190
This didn't happen
in some drunken brawl.

569
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,990
This was a clinical job.

570
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,570
You can take that. I'm
going to discharge him.

571
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,580
Ashworth.

572
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,950
Ma'am, it's Keith
Barton downstairs.

573
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,450
I asked him to pop by
with Ollie's laptop,

574
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,980
just in case there
was anything on it -

575
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,570
bullying, troubles, like you said.

576
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,020
Now, that's what I like
to see. Bit of initiative.

577
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,750
Tell him I'll be
downstairs in a sec.

578
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,830
No, there's hundreds of 'em, boss.

579
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,310
Come on, boss, we can't
get him. He's out there.

580
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,830
He's dead. He's one
of ours. Come on, lads!

581
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,740
I don't know what happened,
boss. I cleared them.

582
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,300
I've cleared the
lEDs, I'm telling you!

583
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,510
Come on, Budgie, man up!

584
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,630
We can't move. Ollie's out
there! Ollie's out there!

585
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,450
Let go of me. Please, please!

586
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,410
Please, Budgie. Please.

587
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,270
It's not gunfire, Budgie.

588
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,020
No.

589
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,150
It's just drilling.

590
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,580
Is it loud noises... like drilling?

591
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:20,710
Bring it all back for you? Is it?

592
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,960
Your fireworks?

593
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,910
Is that what happened
that night, Budgie?

594
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,140
The fireworks? You didn't
want to be on your own?

595
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,220
Or maybe...

596
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:38,220
maybe Dev thought you
shouldn't be on your own.

597
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,880
So he took you back
to his place instead?

598
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,030
But some time in the
night you woke up,

599
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,530
and that's when you saw
him, didn't you, Budgie?

600
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,950
And you thought you'd done it, hm?

601
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,010
Budgie, he'd been dead for hours.

602
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,000
Stand down, Budgie! Stand down!

603
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,590
Joe, easy!

604
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,560
OK, Budgie. OK.

605
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,940
But I saw myself do it.

606
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,360
You didn't kill him, Budgie.

607
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,270
I can still see him,
lying there in the sand.

608
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,780
His limbs like a jigsaw

609
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,320
I can't put back together.

610
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,320
Who?

611
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,330
You mean Dev?

612
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,490
Or Ollie?

613
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,720
The dead don't leave you.

614
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,430
What are you looking at?

615
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,850
Go and get me a large
drink and a psychiatrist.

616
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,880
At last, the cry for help.

617
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,040
I'll make you a wee cup of tea, ma'am.

618
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,190
I know that it would've been
Dev's last will and testament

619
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,290
that we get absolutely
hammered in his memory.

620
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,920
OK. To Dev.

621
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,370
- To Dev!
- Sandancer legend.

622
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,190
Don't they give these
lads any kind of help,

623
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,530
after all they've been through?

624
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,120
Counsellors are available,

625
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,430
but soldiers have
to know they've got a

626
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,770
problem to consult them.

627
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,030
And if they do, it's
still seen as a sign

628
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,400
of weakness by some.

629
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,850
I'll make some calls tonight.

630
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,740
Thanks for the lift.

631
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,730
You don't want to
overdo the exercise.

632
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,990
I've still got 10km
to run when I get home.

633
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,640
What, are you being
punished for something?

634
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,000
Iron Man challenge.

635
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,630
Well, cannot let the RMPs down.

636
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,590
Show the grunts what
us monkeys can do.

637
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,150
That's what they call us!

638
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,365
- Where's Budgie?
- Off with the birds.

639
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,160
I sent him a text.
Told him where we were.

640
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,540
Joe?

641
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,930
Just to let you know, Ollie's
emails have been cleaned out.

642
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,070
His folders, his
trash-can, everything.

643
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,750
And it wasn't done two
months ago before he died.

644
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,800
<i>It was done today.</i>

645
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,430
- Well, Mum or Dad?
- His dad seemed fine about bringing it in.

646
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,280
Well, let's pay them
another visit tomorrow.

647
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,540
And Laura Deverson.

648
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,920
<i>Now, Joe, you get yourself
home to Celine and the kids.</i>

649
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,530
- Good night.
- Night. Night.

650
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,260
Where are we going, lads?

651
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,740
Right, I'll see you losers later.

652
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,800
- Where are you off?
- Oh, aye, Grafton, where are you off to?

653
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,750
- How does it compare?
- Different angle to the first.

654
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:49,180
Upward. Entered jaw here,
exited skull... here.

655
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,580
Might also have been awake
when it happened.

656
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,060
Gun?

657
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,720
Silencer.
It's just like the other one.

658
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,680
It's not army, though.
Not British army, anyway.

659
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,290
Russian maybe.

660
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,950
A little memento from Afghanistan.
Isn't that what he said?

661
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,340
Oh, well, see what there
are in the way of prints.

662
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,380
- Note?
- No.

663
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,330
So what are we saying?
Same killer?

664
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,640
Or a copycat.

665
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:21,350
Apart from the angle of shot, but
crouching down could explain that.

666
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,640
Any sign of a break-in?

667
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,160
None I can see.

668
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,650
- Who found him?
- Vincent Grafton.

669
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,210
I thought maybe I'd
better check on him.

670
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,780
Was the door locked or unlocked?

671
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,220
Open.

672
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,520
Why did you think you
needed to check on him?

673
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,070
I thought maybe
he'd bugged out or...

674
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,120
Or what? Killed himself?

675
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,430
He was a soldier,

676
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,440
and a good soldier. He
wouldn't have done that.

677
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,150
I was just checking he
wasn't ill or something.

678
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,400
What did you do last night?

679
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,620
I was out. Drinking to Dev.

680
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,220
After?

681
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,270
Came back here.

682
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,510
Went to bed.

683
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,860
Ma'am...

684
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,460
Why was he in uniform?

685
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,000
We were a guard down.

686
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,150
Must have had to
do last-minute stag.

687
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,460
Well, we'll need the logbook

688
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,770
from the front gate, Shep.

689
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:51,580
Right. And the CO wishes
to speak to you, ma'am.

690
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,650
Is it OK, if I...?

691
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,920
Thanks.

692
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,670
This latest death is terrible.

693
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,190
For the barracks,

694
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,910
for the regiment, as well
as being a tragedy in itself.

695
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,100
Yet I can't help but think
that it might have been prevented.

696
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,930
If you had not gone around
chasing phantom murderers,

697
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,970
then perhaps Corporal
O'Connor might not have taken

698
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,280
his life in the same way.

699
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,290
We believe somebody killed these men
and might kill more.

700
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,440
And I might be able to get
to the heart of the matter

701
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,040
if you and your men showed
a little more cooperation.

702
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,760
I'm sorry. I don't
understand, Chief Inspector.

703
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,050
Hasn't Captain Shepherd
been of assistance?

704
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,200
Captain Shepherd's
been a great help.

705
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,250
Though I believe
that something happened in Afghanistan.

706
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,410
Something that links the
deaths of these two soldiers,

707
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,410
but nobody's prepared
to talk about it.

708
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:56,000
And what do you suppose
that something is?

709
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,790
Oliver Barton.

710
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:00,810
I've written a full
report.

711
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,530
I've seen it. It's
in Deverson's file.

712
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,990
Then you know what occurred.

713
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,310
I spoke to Keith Barton,

714
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,590
and he was reluctant to
endorse the official version.

715
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,350
So I did a little bit of reading
up on military procedure last night

716
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,150
and I discovered it
was Deverson's job

717
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,770
to ensure that the
incident site is safe.

718
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:21,710
Chief Inspector, I do not believe
that you have the authority...

719
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,530
Did Deverson follow procedure?

720
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,660
Maybe not to the letter, but...

721
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,090
So he could be seen
to be responsible?

722
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,500
Barton was Deverson's number two.

723
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,130
Even if he technically should not

724
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,930
have been the one
to secure the ground,

725
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,380
he had the skill-set to do so.

726
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,100
So it is only in
the letter of the law

727
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:43,580
that Keith Barton and his
family might have a case.

728
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,970
What sort of a case?

729
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,840
They were pursuing
the matter?

730
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,070
I cannot speak for them.

731
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,220
On the night that James
Deverson was killed,

732
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,790
you invited the Bartons back
to your house for drinks.

733
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,090
- Did you talk about Ollie?
- Amongst other things.

734
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,530
They wanted you to
push for an inquiry.

735
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,180
And you told them no.

736
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,010
What time did they leave?

737
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:24,130
As I told Captain Shepherd,
approximately at 1:45am.

738
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,140
Shep,

739
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,630
you stay here, take
statements Dev's team,

740
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,990
what's left of them.

741
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,210
Anyone who saw Budgie last night.

742
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,590
And guns.

743
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,470
You've got to find all
these personal arsenals

744
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,540
before anyone else gets hurt.

745
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,090
Are Keith or Diana home?

746
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,200
No. Dad's with the shoot and
Mum's at the cash-and-carry.

747
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,220
Can I help?

748
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,280
Peas in a pod?

749
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,720
The terrible twins, Mum always
used to call me and Ollie.

750
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,990
And you're with the Royal
Ordnance Fusiliers too?

751
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,740
Medical Corps, but
I'm based at Otterford.

752
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:35,690
Still completing my
training at Newcastle

753
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,000
City Hospital.

754
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:40,170
What, then you'll go to
Afghanistan, will you?

755
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:41,550
If I'm needed.

756
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,260
It's sad to say, but theatre of ops

757
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,560
is one of the best places
to learn new theatre skills.

758
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,260
What was it you wanted?

759
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,210
Could we have a
look at Ollie's room?

760
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,910
See if we can get some idea.

761
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,950
He still had a room here?

762
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,500
Yeah.

763
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,200
- But why?
- We're looking

764
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,660
into your brother's death, and

765
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,490
and trying to find out
exactly what happened in Afghanistan.

766
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,090
We were very different, me and Ol.

767
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,080
I'd bury myself in some science books,

768
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:26,040
and he'd be into the
back of an old computer or

769
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,880
radio or circuit board.

770
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,880
Dad wanted us to go to uni

771
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:32,190
and then on to officer training.

772
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,590
He'd risen up through the ranks. He
wanted his sons to go further than him.

773
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,320
That's perfectly natural.

774
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,150
But Ollie knew what he wanted.

775
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,120
He didn't want to be
ordering men to do things.

776
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:44,760
Be in there, getting his hands
dirty, doing them himself.

777
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,350
He signed up as a
private after school.

778
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,430
Ollie had just been selected for

779
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,350
his final training
to become an ATO.

780
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,280
So he'd have then been
qualified to do Dev's job?

781
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,750
Deverson insisted that he'd only go
back out if Ollie was his number two.

782
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:02,580
- Or what?
- He'd quit.

783
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,850
But Ollie could have said no, right?

784
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,050
Dev would have made sure that was
him finished in ordnance disposal.

785
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,090
Deverson must have thought
highly of him, all the same.

786
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,290
You have to trust the men
you're out there with.

787
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,870
What do you think
happened in Helmand, Alex?

788
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,790
Look, your parents think Ollie's
death might've been preventable.

789
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,260
They think there might
be grounds for an inquiry.

790
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:30,570
So why don't you tell us

791
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,020
what you think happened out there,

792
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,510
and maybe we can help.

793
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,130
Deverson defused an IED.

794
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:43,370
They did the controlled explosion,

795
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,690
but then he sent Ollie
in to give the all-clear.

796
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,160
That's Deverson's job,

797
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,160
as officer in charge,
to give the all-clear.

798
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,160
But how would Deverson know
there were more lEDs?

799
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:58,770
He'd been up to the incident site.
He'd seen the lie of the land.

800
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,360
If there were any more ground
signs of devices, he'd know.

801
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,350
You think he wanted Ollie killed?

802
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,000
Well, I'm not saying that.

803
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,480
And now that Deverson's
dead, we'll never know.

804
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,560
Were you here the night
Deverson was killed?

805
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,490
- Anyone vouch for you?
- Yeah.

806
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:25,830
No.

807
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,130
My parents were here earlier in
the evening before the dinner.

808
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,240
- What about last night?
- I was on duty at the hospital.

809
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,630
And your parents? Where were they?

810
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:37,530
They were up at the main house.

811
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,320
There was a dinner for
the first day of the shoot.

812
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,030
Ollie's laptop that your father
brought in to us yesterday,

813
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:46,330
the emails had been wiped.

814
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,560
Know anything about that, Alex?

815
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,790
You've got to help us here.

816
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,560
It was nothing to
do with Afghanistan.

817
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,490
It was girlfriend stuff.

818
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,310
Private, that's all.

819
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,430
He's dead.

820
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:09,400
Is he not entitled to his dignity?

821
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:14,950
All right.

822
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,120
No, that's great.

823
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:18,650
Thanks, Kenny.

824
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,990
Cadvar House confirmed the
Bartons were there last night.

825
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,600
- Alex Barton?
- The hospital says he was

826
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:24,060
- on night shift.
- Laura Deverson?

827
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,370
At home.

828
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:29,450
- Oh. Anything on divorce proceedings?
- Kenny says no sign.

829
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,350
- And the good news?
- The prints on the gun.

830
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,700
Vincent Grafton.

831
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,990
You might be interested
in this, then.

832
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:40,250
I did a search of the lines,
looking for illegal firearms.

833
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,670
Well, where do you come across
a collection like this?

834
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,660
You'd be surprised what $20

835
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:58,180
will get you at a souk
in Basra or Sangin.

836
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,960
Did you talk to the others
who were with him last night?

837
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,710
They said he left them down at
the quayside around midnight.

838
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,350
But look at this. From the
logbook at the front gate.

839
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,090
Right, then, Vince,
I think you'd better come with us.

840
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,130
- You arresting me?
- Can do, if you like,

841
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,720
unless you've got licences
for your little arsenal.

842
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:43,150
So you were out on the lash
on Dean Street last night?

843
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,680
Had a few bevvies.

844
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,160
Well, you sign back in at 11:30pm.

845
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,970
You gets back at 11:30?

846
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,620
If that's what it says.

847
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,690
Only the name before yours

848
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,740
gets back at 12:20am.

849
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,550
Your colleagues said they
left you down at the quayside.

850
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,020
Were you with anyone?

851
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,870
- Maybe I got lucky.
- A woman?

852
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,530
She have a name?

853
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,450
You don't think much of
women, do you, Corporal?

854
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,800
I like them.

855
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,020
Lots.

856
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,380
I just don't want to
get too close to them.

857
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,090
They mess you up,
when you're a soldier.

858
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,420
Like Ollie?

859
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:40,680
I don't know what
you're talking about.

860
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,870
Well, he had girlfriend
problems, didn't he?

861
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,740
Yeah.

862
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,020
He had some problems
with his bird before...

863
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,260
before the last tour.

864
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,440
So? It's pretty common in our line.

865
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,640
What's her name? Ollie's girlfriend.

866
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,340
- She have one?
- I'm sure she did.

867
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:04,080
But I didn't know her, did I?

868
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,630
Listen, Vince,

869
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:11,190
Budgie was killed with a weapon
you smuggled back from Afghanistan.

870
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,500
Your prints are all over it.

871
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:14,260
So I suggest you start telling us.

872
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:16,390
So what if Budgie
was shot with my gun?

873
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,320
Doesn't mean I did it.

874
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,660
He knew I had them guns.
Loads of the guys did.

875
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,230
- Where were you last night?
- I was with someone, wasn't I?

876
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,990
You stop off at a hotel
or a B&B?

877
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,560
I was down the front.
Didn't get back till dawn.

878
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,840
My mate Kez was on stag

879
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,400
at front gate that
morning. Ask him.

880
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,330
Kenny, I've got to check something.
Watch our back, will you?

881
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,120
Yeah, sure.

882
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,940
What happened in Afghanistan
the day Oliver Barton died?

883
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,550
Listen, Vince, I'm not interested

884
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,790
in the rights or wrongs
of what goes on out there.

885
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,020
But I believe that
the death of Budgie

886
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:03,710
and of Deverson have
something to do with it.

887
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,810
Dev changed, the last tour.

888
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,950
He was still the best
at his job and all.

889
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,450
You could put your house
on him to get you through.

890
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,470
But outside, he didn't join in.

891
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,280
No banter.

892
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,690
Distant.

893
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,290
Especially with Ollie.

894
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:01,300
Do you blame Deverson
for Ollie's death?

895
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,350
Or do you blame Budgie?

896
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,550
The sentry admits he entered
the wrong time on the log.

897
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,300
Said it was well after
dawn when he got back.

898
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,730
Yeah, can we trust that?

899
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,830
These lads would rather go to
jail than tell us the truth.

900
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,380
Get Shep to check the CCTV.

901
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,930
- You still think he did it?
- Aye.

902
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:48,170
- Where are you off to?
- Evening shift will be starting.

903
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,510
You can knock off
when you've done that.

904
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,180
Stupid!

905
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,640
- Have you got a moment?
- Er, yeah.

906
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,870
Right, Budgie's death, forget
about Deverson's for the minute...

907
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,870
What do the forensics tell us?

908
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,060
Yeah, angle of shot
suggests he was awake.

909
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:26,970
- Right.
- Teeth weren't

910
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,460
broken or burnt like Dev's.

911
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:29,970
- Right. What else?
- Which means

912
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,440
his mouth was open for the gun.

913
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,780
Yeah, sorry.

914
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:39,090
No sign of a struggle either.

915
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,050
Yeah, if it wasn't
for the other death,

916
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,790
I'd have said he took
his own life.

917
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,580
Here's me feeling so smug.

918
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,320
Because Deverson's death

919
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:53,750
looked too like a
suicide to be a suicide,

920
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,540
I've only gone and assumed
Budgie's was the same

921
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,940
because it looked
so much like Dev's.

922
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,730
Budgie wanted us to arrest him.

923
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:05,080
<i>To save him from himself.</i>

924
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,670
Thanks, Billy.

925
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:23,930
So let's proceed on the assumption
that Budgie's death was not murder,

926
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,850
though that doesn't
rule out a connection.

927
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,450
All these lads were
members of the same unit,

928
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,090
close colleagues of Oliver Barton,

929
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,600
whose death they all witnessed.

930
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:32,910
Ma'am,

931
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,750
computer forensics have recovered
Oliver Barton's deleted emails.

932
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,320
We might have our connection.

933
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,910
I'll see you in a minute.

934
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,380
What, you're not coming?

935
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,600
No, you go and charm her first.

936
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,210
I'm sorry that he killed himself,
but I didn't know him that well.

937
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,220
Dev didn't talk much about the others?

938
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,680
He said he had a private
self and a soldier self.

939
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,150
He thought he could switch
one off and the other on.

940
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,810
And when he was on tour?

941
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,260
No demands from us
on his private self,

942
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,630
so he could be all soldier.

943
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,190
<i>It must be difficult
being away from each other</i>

944
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,010
for such a long period of time.

945
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,230
Him not writing much.

946
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,230
You got into his email account?

947
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,090
He did still care
about you, Laura. He...

948
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,060
He was holding this picture...

949
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:49,670
when he died.

950
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,100
So much of my married
life I've been alone.

951
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,450
While Jim was off saving the world,

952
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,800
I was stuck in his
house, in his barracks,

953
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:10,500
being father and
mother to his kids.

954
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:16,600
And the funny thing is, I don't even
understand what we're doing there.

955
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:18,710
Afghanistan. It's their country.

956
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,110
If they want to live like that -

957
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,270
killing and murdering, maiming...

958
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:24,610
So why do we have to go
and sort it out for them?

959
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,770
Why does my husband have to
go and sort it out for them?

960
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,740
You did get close to
Ollie Barton, didn't you?

961
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,300
Yeah. He knew what
it was like for me.

962
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,360
And then it became something else?

963
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,230
Now, why didn't you tell
us this before, Laura?

964
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,230
Because it wasn't like that.
For me, at least.

965
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:54,550
You can't understand how trapped,

966
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,260
how penned in on every side,

967
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:59,580
I was, I am... I still am.

968
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,300
Between children and

969
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,780
the army and Dev and

970
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:06,720
expectation...

971
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,720
And when Dev found out, what did he do?

972
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,750
He went round to Ollie's
and threatened him,

973
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:17,210
threatened to kill
him. He had a gun.

974
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,650
He kept a gun in the house.

975
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,180
And they got into a fight.

976
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:23,840
The RMPs had to
come and sort it out.

977
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:25,430
They said they'd
put him on a warning.

978
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:26,950
It's not in the file.

979
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:30,340
He was their star-turn.
Clearing mines, saving lives,

980
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:33,170
winning medals. But then again,

981
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:35,220
maybe Jim just sorted it himself.

982
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,690
Like he sorted it for all the wives

983
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,110
to have nothing to
do with me after.

984
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,610
Like he sorted it for Ollie.

985
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:43,970
You think he knowingly
put Ollie's life in danger?

986
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:46,280
I don't know what to
think, I just know that

987
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:49,860
Jim insisted Ollie
went on that tour.

988
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,680
The...

989
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,060
the little red hatchback,

990
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,080
that's your car, is it, pet?

991
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,860
Yeah.

992
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:06,400
Only I was talking to your
neighbour, Mrs. Preston.

993
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,790
She's very observant.

994
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:11,030
She said your car
was gone until the

995
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,750
early hours the night
your husband was killed.

996
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,150
I went out, yeah.

997
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,710
Now, that's different from
what you told us before.

998
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,270
I was with Alex.

999
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:23,090
Alex Barton? Ollie's brother?

1000
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:26,670
He'd found out about me and
Ollie from Ollie's emails, and

1001
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,430
he wanted to ask me if
the family could use them

1002
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,690
as evidence for an inquiry
into Ollie's death.

1003
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:38,000
Evidence that your husband
had a motive to harm Ollie?

1004
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,860
And what did you tell them?

1005
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:42,550
How could I look
my kids in the eye?

1006
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:45,380
Turning against their
father. I couldn't do that.

1007
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:46,900
I couldn't do what
they were asking me.

1008
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,810
- They?
- Alex and Ollie's parents

1009
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,940
were there for a bit. And
then they went to dinner.

1010
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,410
And you stayed with Alex?

1011
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,930
We were just drinking
wine and remembering Ollie.

1012
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:59,760
And I drank too much,
so Alex drove me home.

1013
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:01,710
- In his car?
- In mine.

1014
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,850
- What time was that?
- Midnight, just after.

1015
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,630
- Then what?
- He got a cab

1016
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,940
and went home.

1017
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,580
So?

1018
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,220
Why would Alex clear
his brother's emails

1019
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:22,440
when he wanted Laura
to go public with them?

1020
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,830
Because she said no.

1021
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:26,950
Because Dev was dead.

1022
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,780
It only embarrasses her.

1023
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:30,710
What, and he didn't
want to embarrass her?

1024
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:38,770
Deverson puts Ollie in
danger in Afghanistan,

1025
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:41,190
getting him back for
sleeping with his missus.

1026
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,620
Ollie dies.

1027
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,700
His soldiers support
his story because...?

1028
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,780
Because Ollie had broken
trust. It's a code of honour.

1029
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,050
Or maybe they don't all agree.

1030
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,550
Vince Grafton thinks Dev
could be a mean bastard.

1031
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,790
Maybe he thinks
that Dev would put him in danger.

1032
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,500
Then Vince can't
hack it when Dev gets

1033
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:03,710
his Military Cross,
knowing what's gone on.

1034
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:05,470
Or maybe he's paying them back for

1035
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,720
endangering him with
their private squabbles.

1036
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,330
Thinks women are
trouble, doesn't he?

1037
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,610
You showed Laura this photo?

1038
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:32,980
- Did you tell her where we found it?
- Yeah.

1039
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:37,120
- How did she take it?
- She was surprised,

1040
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:38,780
given everything that's gone on.

1041
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,100
Deverson was estranged
from his wife.

1042
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,290
She's had an affair
with one of his mates.

1043
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:46,870
Yet the night he dies, he falls
asleep clutching her picture...

1044
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,740
He still loves her?

1045
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,390
Or maybe the killer
put it there.

1046
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,830
And where does the killer get it?

1047
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:55,450
The wall?

1048
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,650
Not the sort of picture
you'd put on the wall, Joe.

1049
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:00,140
You can leave that.

1050
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:03,650
Not the same without
something to dunk anyway.

1051
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,380
Ma'am!

1052
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,060
Come on!

1053
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,040
Chief Inspector.

1054
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,890
No-one in.

1055
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:30,610
No, Alex is up at the hospital
and Keith's away with the shoot.

1056
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,140
He won't be back till after dark.

1057
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,700
Alex said you called
yesterday as well.

1058
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,370
Well, we're still
trying to piece together

1059
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:42,090
exactly what happened to
your son in Afghanistan.

1060
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,740
Does that mean there might
be an inquiry after all?

1061
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,000
Well, it's not for
me to decide, pet,

1062
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:51,510
but if we could uncover
further evidence...

1063
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:54,170
Can we talk?

1064
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,760
It's very beautiful here, isn't it?

1065
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,380
Is it?

1066
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,500
Yeah, I suppose it is.

1067
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,630
I suppose I should count myself
lucky to live in such a place.

1068
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,090
But I don't feel lucky.

1069
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,960
I feel like I've given my whole
life in the service of this country.

1070
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,430
First trailing after
Keith with the boys,

1071
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:25,020
while he's posted to Germany
and Ireland and God knows where.

1072
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,950
And then, when we finally
come home and make a home,

1073
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,220
you know, a real home...

1074
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,500
my...

1075
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,350
my own little boy...

1076
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:46,940
You know, when I hear
some boy's won a medal,

1077
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,890
I think about his
wife and his mother.

1078
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,510
I think of all the
tears that have been shed

1079
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,090
in the winning of that medal.

1080
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:05,040
Were you upset that Laura
Deverson wouldn't allow you to use

1081
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,510
to use her affair with your son

1082
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,980
as evidence to push for an inquiry?

1083
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,910
No, I wasn't.

1084
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:16,250
I don't condone her actions, but I
just thought it was unfair to ask her.

1085
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,570
She's a soldier's wife...

1086
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,740
and...

1087
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:27,700
e the lover of another
soldier, apparently. My son.

1088
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:31,640
And I expect she's
suffered greatly.

1089
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,500
But your husband and Alex?

1090
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:38,250
Well, Keith wanted to go ahead
and make it public anyway.

1091
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,660
And...

1092
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:41,570
Alex, I don't know.

1093
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,150
And by the time I
saw him the next day,

1094
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:47,040
James Deverson was dead.

1095
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,920
Did your husband discuss an inquiry

1096
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:52,680
with Dominic Chapell at
his house, after the dinner?

1097
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,850
- Yeah, they talked, yeah.
- Yeah, and?

1098
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:58,450
And Dominic said he couldn't help us.

1099
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,630
Mrs. Barton, Diana,

1100
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:09,100
I don't suppose you have
a hairbrush of Ollie's,

1101
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:11,530
or a lock of hair?

1102
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,850
For DNA.

1103
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:20,370
No, I'm afraid... I'm afraid
I didn't keep a lock of hair.

1104
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,690
Well, anything at all
that might have traces?

1105
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,780
His army kit, perhaps.

1106
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,230
No, I washed and
mended his uniform.

1107
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,170
I'm sorry, pet.

1108
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,510
What about his teeth?

1109
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,080
Excuse me?

1110
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,650
His baby teeth. Do
you still have them?

1111
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,760
Thanks, Mrs. Barton.

1112
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,550
Right, I'm taking them
straight to the lab.

1113
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,460
Get them to crosscheck those teeth
with the blood on the original of this.

1114
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,170
Stand over them while
they do it, if you have to.

1115
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,210
- Where are you going?
- Shep.

1116
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,600
See if Laura
Deverson's story's true

1117
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:17,810
about Dev threatening
Ollie with a gun

1118
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:21,090
and, if so, why any report of
it's been removed from the file.

1119
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,260
The keeping of soldiers' records

1120
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:25,850
is not my responsibility,
Chief Inspector.

1121
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,150
Captain Shepherd has found you made

1122
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,810
special pleadings
to her predecessor

1123
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:36,190
not to have the charge of affray
added to Dev's record.

1124
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:39,210
It was a personal conflict,

1125
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,870
out of character, no
reflection on his soldiering.

1126
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,220
Plus it would have reflected
badly on the regiment.

1127
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,930
And there'd be no chance
of him winning any honours,

1128
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,800
let alone the Military
Cross after that.

1129
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,905
I did not think it was
relevant to your investigation.

1130
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:55,160
It is not for you to decide what is

1131
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:58,060
or is not relevant
to my investigation.

1132
01:13:58,070 --> 01:14:00,710
Now, is there anything
else you have withheld?

1133
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,020
Chief Inspector,

1134
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:05,040
you are meant to be investigating
the death of these two men.

1135
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:09,530
Instead, you seem intent on questioning
military operation and procedure,

1136
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,290
which lie beyond the range of
your jurisdiction or competence.

1137
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:15,060
You're in no position to
question my competence.

1138
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:19,960
Captain Shepherd, I must ask you to
resume charge of this investigation,

1139
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:22,190
as I should have
insisted from the outset.

1140
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,050
Now, if you don't mind.

1141
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:28,060
I'm afraid I cannot comply
with this request, sir.

1142
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,350
It is not a request, Captain.

1143
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:35,150
Sir, you have no procedural
authority over RMP.

1144
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,250
No, but you do have authority
over this investigation.

1145
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:41,180
Under the Provost
Martial's ruling of 2009,

1146
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:44,410
in all serious crime relating
to the military in the UK,

1147
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:46,670
the civilian police
will take the lead.

1148
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,180
Sir.

1149
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,260
Hey, Shep, I hope that hasn't
ruined your chances of promotion.

1150
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,000
Well, like CID,

1151
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:02,860
we're independent of
the powers that be.

1152
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:05,270
- At least, that's the theory.
- We've got our match.

1153
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,330
Two different blood
traces on the photo.

1154
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:08,820
Dev's and Ollie Barton's.

1155
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:11,570
And I confirmed with Laura
that she gave the photo to Ollie

1156
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,040
before he went to Afghanistan.

1157
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:14,870
Ollie had it on him when he died.

1158
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,570
- That's the motive.
- Revenge

1159
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:19,810
for the death of Oliver
Barton in Helmand.

1160
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:24,000
Now, the killer planted the
photo on Deverson as a sign,

1161
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,650
thinking that since
Laura's his wife,

1162
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,970
no-one but them's
going to see it as such.

1163
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:31,990
Who had access to
Ollie's personal effects?

1164
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,150
They would have been
returned to his family.

1165
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:37,490
Let's pay a little
visit to the hospital.

1166
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,620
We talked about Ollie,
mainly, and family.

1167
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,250
Around midnight, I
drove her in her car

1168
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,560
back to her place,

1169
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:21,280
and then I got a cab home.

1170
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:24,610
So you left your house with
Laura Deverson at midnight.

1171
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:27,100
Arrived at her house at 1 am.

1172
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,460
What time did you get home, Alex?

1173
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:34,080
- Around 2:30.
- Took a detour?

1174
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,270
Stop by the barracks,
settle an old score?

1175
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,650
- No.
- What, then?

1176
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:41,600
I was waiting for the cab.

1177
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:43,550
What did you do while you waiting?

1178
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:46,110
Talked.

1179
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,500
Talked?

1180
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,810
- Where?
- Laura's car.

1181
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:52,400
What about?

1182
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:55,170
Ollie.

1183
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,000
Eh, that's a lot of
talking about Ollie.

1184
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:01,170
- Nothing else?
- It's difficult.

1185
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:03,640
- It's complicated.
- Aye, it would be,

1186
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:06,090
holding a torch for big
brother's girlfriend.

1187
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,070
- No.
- It wasn't to protect

1188
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,810
Ollie's privacy you
wiped his emails.

1189
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,180
It was to cover their
affair and your tracks.

1190
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:17,030
I don't have to say anything, do
I? I don't have a lawyer present.

1191
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:20,240
I haven't arrested you yet.
Would you prefer that?

1192
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:23,590
- Joe...
- OK. OK.

1193
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,380
It's because...

1194
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,970
because I could see the whole
thing had caused her so much pain.

1195
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,310
And after that night,
after hearing her side,

1196
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,960
I thought my dad should just
give up looking for an inquiry.

1197
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:40,840
It was your dad pushing
for the inquiry, was it?

1198
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:42,200
And me.

1199
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:44,410
But I was doing it for him.

1200
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,790
After that night, I thought
it just prolonged the pain.

1201
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,550
I told him, before he
left for the dinner.

1202
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,530
And then when I heard
that Deverson was dead,

1203
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,590
it just seemed cruel to
drag Laura through it again.

1204
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,330
- What about the photo of Laura?
- What photo?

1205
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:02,390
The one with Ollie's
things from Afghanistan.

1206
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,990
I've never seen it.

1207
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,740
Well, it would have been
sent to his next of kin.

1208
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,500
I'm not his next of kin.

1209
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:16,100
I don't care how long it takes,
I want every little detail, Joe.

1210
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:17,620
And don't take any slaver from him.

1211
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:19,100
You going to be all
right on your own?

1212
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:39,170
Kenny says that the
cab company confirmed

1213
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:43,090
that a passenger was picked up
outside house Deverson at 1:30am

1214
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:46,550
and that they dropped off around
the Cadvar Estate around 2:30am.

1215
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,940
So there is no way they
had time to take a detour

1216
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:50,600
<i>around the Otterford
Barracks in that time.</i>

1217
01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:53,500
And Shep's checked,
there's no record of Alex Barton

1218
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:56,590
entering or leaving the
camp by foot that night?

1219
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:57,900
No, none.

1220
01:18:57,910 --> 01:19:00,720
- What about Chapell?
- There's still no sign.

1221
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:02,030
Well, get her to call him again.

1222
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,090
I don't care if
he's invading France.

1223
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:05,670
If he's not with
her in five minutes,

1224
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,970
I'll have him arrested
for obstruction.

1225
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:10,110
- Chief Inspector?
- Which way

1226
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,440
was the hunt headed, Mrs. Barton?

1227
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,590
It's at Cadvar Woods. Why?

1228
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:15,980
Thanks, pet.

1229
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,670
What's going on?

1230
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:26,280
Mum?

1231
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,170
I was in a meeting with military
officials, Captain Shepherd.

1232
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:38,350
What was it that couldn't wait?

1233
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,840
The night that
Deverson was murdered,

1234
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:42,770
you invited the Bartons to your
house after the dinner at the hall.

1235
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,340
It was more like Keith insisted.

1236
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:45,750
He wanted to talk about his son.

1237
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,080
And how far is your house?

1238
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:49,210
20 minutes by foot.
Five minutes by car.

1239
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:51,040
You drove? You took them in your car?

1240
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:53,150
Could you show us?

1241
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,210
- You said their stayed till 1:45?
- Yes.

1242
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,100
Did they walk back from your house
to the car park?

1243
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:23,870
Diana was tired.

1244
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:27,320
She was wearing heels. Keith
decided to go back for the car.

1245
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:30,750
And would they pass by this way?

1246
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,500
It's one way they could have come.

1247
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,190
Is this the most direct way?

1248
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,770
Keith Barton!

1249
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,320
Mr. Barton!

1250
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,100
How long was he gone?

1251
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,390
Hard to say. 20 minutes...

1252
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,360
Was it not more like half
an hour or 40 minutes,

1253
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:09,590
and that's why they
were so late leaving?

1254
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,830
You and Barton go back
a long way, don't you?

1255
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,550
He was platoon sergeant on
your first tour, wasn't he?

1256
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:18,000
I've committed no crime, Sergeant.

1257
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:21,440
I was asked what time they left
and I have told you accurately.

1258
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,620
Gibbet.

1259
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,710
Where we hang the vermin.

1260
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:38,890
Scares others off.

1261
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,970
I know it's frowned on,

1262
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:45,770
but nature doesn't
operate by man's laws.

1263
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,410
Your father would have understood that.

1264
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:51,690
Put the gun down, Keith.

1265
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:56,160
I'd have done anything for them,

1266
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:57,470
my boys.

1267
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,020
Same as in the army.

1268
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:06,110
The only way a unit survives

1269
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,230
is by standing together.
Whatever it takes.

1270
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,000
Dad!

1271
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,390
Now it's all changed.

1272
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,870
All hearts and minds.

1273
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:19,900
Ollie and I disagreed on that.

1274
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,310
He thought you could
reason with the enemy,

1275
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:24,890
make them see you're right.

1276
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,770
But then he gave
his heart to a woman,

1277
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:32,170
and look what her husband did.

1278
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:36,050
He insisted on Ollie
going on that second tour.

1279
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,970
So he could fix him.

1280
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:40,850
So I fixed him.

1281
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,280
Natural law.

1282
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:45,880
Dad!

1283
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:53,410
Keith, don't! Don't!

1284
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,530
Do you think I'm going
to sit there and watch,

1285
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,400
while the murderer of my son

1286
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:58,790
is awarded a medal for bravery?

1287
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,280
- Dad!
- So you took it, did you, Keith?

1288
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:03,150
- Dad, please!
- You took his Military Cross?

1289
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,940
I looked for it,

1290
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:06,250
but I expect even he

1291
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:07,560
was ashamed to keep it.

1292
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:10,290
It is not your fault Ollie died.
Please don't do this.

1293
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:12,160
Stop!

1294
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,220
They say it's just a flesh wound.

1295
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:31,910
Like you said,

1296
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,990
it takes guts to
go through with it.

1297
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,230
It'll take more than guts
to live with what he's done.

1298
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:12,030
May God give you his
comfort and his peace.

1299
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:18,330
His light and his joy in
this world and the next.

1300
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,310
And the blessing of God Almighty,

1301
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:25,590
the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit

1302
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:29,970
be among you and
remain with you always.

1303
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:33,290
- Amen.
- Amen.

1304
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:52,160
Vince.

1305
01:24:57,940 --> 01:25:00,950
Look, I know it doesn't compare,

1306
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,410
what we do.

1307
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,220
But what we're fighting for,

1308
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:06,790
both of us in our own way,

1309
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:10,210
it's for more than just our mates.

1310
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:12,910
And though it's not always pretty,

1311
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:16,540
we're both good at what we do.

1312
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:33,380
So you let him off
the weapons charge?

1313
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:34,690
Yeah, on condition he has his

1314
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:37,090
little mementos decommissioned.

1315
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:40,370
So, Shep, what's next for you?

1316
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:43,980
Oh, you know, 15km run,
see what's on my desk.

1317
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:46,390
Glutton for punishment, you!

1318
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:50,620
Still, if you're ever
looking for something,

1319
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:53,820
you know, when you're done with
your marching and your saluting,

1320
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,120
or if your senior officers
stand in your way...

1321
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,280
you look us up, hm?

1322
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,500
Hey, your garden is transformed.

1323
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:31,240
Well, had to be done.

1324
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:36,330
That shrub got so overgrown,
it kept banging on the window.

1325
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:40,690
Kept thinking it was Heathcliff
coming to take me away!

1326
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,480
So where's this
stuff you want moving?

1327
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:44,650
No bob-a-job
today, pet.

1328
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:47,430
That was just a ploy
to get you over here.

1329
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,360
- Look at that.
- Lunch.

1330
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:54,390
Return the compliment.

1331
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,270
Well, that's lovely, boss. But salad?

1332
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:59,490
Yeah, I know. The end of the world.

1333
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:05,000
Come on, I'm feeling
all demob happy,

1334
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:08,300
as if I've made it
through basic training.

1335
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:13,200
Eh, that's it. Come here.

1336
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,160
Where is he?

1337
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,280
Where are you?
Give up.

1338
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,230
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1339
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,600
- Come on, Jimmy!
- Come on, Jimmy!

1340
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:58,730

2
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:23,477
That's it. Go look at the back
and get his paperwork.

3
00:00:23,517 --> 00:00:24,837
OK.

4
00:00:26,077 --> 00:00:27,517
Whoa!

5
00:00:28,597 --> 00:00:30,597
All right, mate? Got your papers?

6
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:33,957
Thanks.

7
00:01:21,637 --> 00:01:23,637
All right, when you're ready, mate.

8
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:51,517
Girls?

9
00:01:52,717 --> 00:01:54,437
Mira?

10
00:02:03,077 --> 00:02:04,357
Dan!

11
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:08,357
Dan!

12
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:13,037
Girls?

13
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:14,637
Karen?

14
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:17,117
Mira?

15
00:02:17,157 --> 00:02:18,997
Girls?

16
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,077
Karen!

17
00:02:22,117 --> 00:02:23,517
Mira!

19
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:49,437
Some party.

20
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:54,917
Ballistics are ten minutes away.

21
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:56,957
Right. Local search?

22
00:02:56,997 --> 00:03:00,237
We're speaking to the neighbours...
such as they are.

23
00:03:10,997 --> 00:03:12,797
How did the intruder get in?

24
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:14,397
The front door was open.

25
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:16,677
Bullets?

26
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:18,637
There's one in the beam up there,
love,

27
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:21,757
one through the cranium,
exit wound back of his skull.

28
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:23,197
Into the wall.

29
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:25,037
Time of death, does he know?

30
00:03:25,077 --> 00:03:28,797
1700 hours. Yeah, I'm right here,
no need for an interpreter.

31
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:30,837
Hour and a half gone, Billy.

32
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:33,477
Checkpoints?

33
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:35,557
All the way from Rothbury
up to Alnwick.

34
00:03:35,597 --> 00:03:37,917
He could be anywhere.
I know.

35
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:41,557
Guns stored in the house?

36
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,157
No, nothing under licence.

37
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:45,237
Somebody turn that thing off.

38
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:47,077
Right.

39
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:49,117
First impressions.

40
00:03:49,157 --> 00:03:50,677
Billy?

41
00:03:51,757 --> 00:03:54,077
He's gearing up for a night in
with the footie.

42
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:57,597
She's got her heart set on one of
them interior lifestyle shows on
digital.

43
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,637
I'll wait for your report.

44
00:03:59,677 --> 00:04:01,677
I'm just getting revved up here.

45
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:14,637
Ma'am?

46
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:18,077
Casts of the intruder's boot print.
Right.

47
00:04:21,237 --> 00:04:25,557
One's bigger than the other.
Aye, left foot's a seven,
right foot's a nine.

48
00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:26,877
That's a mistake.

49
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:31,997
CSI pulled off five sets of
footprints, same story every time
size seven, size nine.

50
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:35,197
OK, so the killer's wearing
odd-sized boots.

51
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:37,717
Maybe there were two of them,
two intruders.

52
00:04:37,757 --> 00:04:39,757
Yeah, possible, of course.

53
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:42,717
Two one-legged intruders.
They won't have got far.

54
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:44,757
Prints leading where?

55
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:46,797
To the vehicle.

56
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:49,837
He... They... took the two daughters
round the back.

57
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:51,877
And then drove off with them.

58
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,917
What is that?

59
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:55,637
Oi!

60
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:59,677
I was in the garden.

61
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:04,517
The girls were having a sort of
dress rehearsal for my husband's
retirement do,

62
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:06,397
the day after tomorrow.

63
00:05:06,437 --> 00:05:08,397
We saw the balloons on the gate.

64
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:11,357
Good job, we'd have driven
straight past.

65
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:14,157
Dan was dreading it, to be honest.

66
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:16,477
30 years a surgeon,
it's all he ever knew.

67
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:25,877
Here we are.

68
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:27,917
What's this?

69
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:31,717
Is that the girls?

70
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:36,637
When did this...
Just now.

71
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:39,717
By courier.
Are these your daughters?

72
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:42,317
Yeah. That's Karen and that's Mira.

73
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:46,837
So Mira... is she the adopted one?

74
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:48,477
That's right, yeah.

75
00:05:48,517 --> 00:05:50,517
Ee, they're bonny lasses.

76
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:52,557
Was there a note?
No.

77
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:57,037
And who would have sent this,
do you think?

78
00:05:57,077 --> 00:05:59,077
I've never seen it before.

79
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:01,677
God, she's gonna hate that one.

80
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:06,197
Anything that passes for a fringe
you know how fussy they get.

81
00:06:08,397 --> 00:06:09,557
Courier?

82
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:11,597
He's outside, giving a statement.

83
00:06:13,077 --> 00:06:16,837
Right, Laura. What time did you last
see your daughters?

84
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:20,997
Oh... about ten to five.

85
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:25,157
I called up to them
before I went out into the garden.

86
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:28,237
Peas or beans?
You know, for their tea.

87
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,597
And they called back?

88
00:06:31,637 --> 00:06:33,637
Mira, peas. Beans for madam.

89
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:35,677
I went with peas.

90
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:38,237
Dan grows them from seed,
it's his pride and joy.

91
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:42,197
Mira always says, 'I like your
garden peas, Dad. They're better
than the real ones.'

92
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,637
And that's when you heard the
gunshot? You were out in the garden?

93
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:56,197
Look...

94
00:06:56,237 --> 00:06:57,757
I have to...

95
00:06:57,797 --> 00:06:59,637
look for them.

96
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:01,997
Mira's expecting her jab
before morning.

97
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:04,477
It's seven o'clock now.
Her what?

98
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:06,517
Her jab, her insulin shot.

99
00:07:07,797 --> 00:07:11,917
Well, then, we're gonna have to get
her back double quick, then,
won't we?

100
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:15,877
Laura, did they have boyfriends,
either of them?

101
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:18,877
Of course.

102
00:07:19,757 --> 00:07:23,237
Karen, she's got a lad, Kyle,
from school.

103
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,277
Do you know where he lives?

104
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:32,277
It's er... this one or...

105
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,317
I should know, shouldn't I? Sorry.

106
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:36,597
Not to worry, love. Joe, which house?

107
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:44,597
Mrs Marsden?

108
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:46,637
Kyle, DCI Vera Stanhope.

109
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:48,477
Are Karen and Mira with you?

110
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:50,317
What?
Mind if I take a look?

111
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:52,157
Go for it.

112
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:05,877
They're not here. I was just
on my way to pick them up.

113
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,477
From where?

114
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:08,877
Home.

115
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,917
When did you last speak to Karen?

116
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:14,397
Er... Geography, the day before
yesterday.

117
00:08:14,437 --> 00:08:15,917
What's going on?

118
00:08:15,957 --> 00:08:18,597
Did you send a package to the house,
a photo?

119
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:19,637
What?

120
00:08:19,677 --> 00:08:21,677
No. Why would I do that?

121
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:23,837
Kyle, we're trying to trace
the girls.

122
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:27,077
If you can think where they might be.

123
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,757
Forget your stupid bloody phone!

124
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:31,397
No. Look.

125
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:32,877
It's Karen.

126
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:36,037
Hey, shut that music off, will you?

127
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:40,197
Kyle?

128
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:42,517
Karen, it's the police.
Where are you, love?

129
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:44,037
Help me, please. Help us.

130
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:46,077
We're in a van.

131
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:49,197
This guy... he's just gone mad.

132
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:52,877
Is your sister with you?

133
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,397
Yeah.

134
00:08:54,437 --> 00:08:56,437
Can I talk to her?

135
00:08:57,477 --> 00:09:00,277
Karen, can you tell us
who took you from the house?

136
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:03,037
Hey, get off! Hey, get off!

137
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,237
And you are?

138
00:09:12,277 --> 00:09:15,237
DC Kelman, ma'am.
I got drafted in two hours ago.

139
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:17,437
See if you can get a trace on this
call, DC Kelman.

140
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:18,757
Got it.

141
00:09:18,797 --> 00:09:21,797
One guy, singular.
One intruder. OK.

142
00:09:21,837 --> 00:09:23,797
With wrong-sized feet. Christ!

143
00:09:23,837 --> 00:09:25,837
What did she say?

144
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:31,757
Laura, I need your permission
to keep track of all your phone
calls,

145
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:33,957
mobile and land line,

146
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:38,677
just in case one of your daughters or
whoever's holding them tries to make
contact.

147
00:09:38,717 --> 00:09:43,317
Typical. Of all the people in the
world, what did she have to go and
call him for?

148
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:44,837
Now, listen.

149
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:48,957
I'm going to do all I humanly can
to get your girls back home again.

150
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:50,197
Hm?

151
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:56,077
What I need you to do is to sit down
with one of my officers, Joe, if you
like...

152
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:57,677
Yeah.

153
00:09:57,717 --> 00:10:01,237
I need a list of anyone
acquainted with your husband.

154
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:06,477
Rivalries, grudges,
however old or daft.

155
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:09,397
Now, is there someone you can be
with?

156
00:10:09,437 --> 00:10:10,797
What?

157
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:13,037
Er... Robin, Karen's godfather.

158
00:10:13,637 --> 00:10:17,557
Well, you give Joe the number
and he'll get in touch. OK?

159
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:22,797
We're just a normal family.

160
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:29,317
Come on, look on the bright side.
We're all on overtime.

161
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:31,357
Can't you get a track on that call?

162
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,317
No joy, I'm afraid.

163
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:35,677
Any contact with the man?
Nothing yet.

164
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:37,797
Five hours gone.

165
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,077
Well, if it's not a ransom
he's after...

166
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:42,197
Two pretty lasses.

167
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:44,157
What, prostitution?

168
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:48,677
What do we know about the boyfriend?

169
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:50,237
Kyle?

170
00:10:50,277 --> 00:10:53,637
Couple of kid brothers, Mum's out
more than she's in. I asked
a neighbour.

171
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:55,717
Hm, initiative.

172
00:10:55,757 --> 00:10:59,037
I expect some of you know DC Kelman,
on loan for a week only.

173
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,757
Hi, Barry.

174
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:02,757
City Hospital.

175
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:07,037
Talk to the murder victim's
colleagues. Let's see what we're
dealing with.

176
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:09,877
Come on, let's earn our keep,
some of you at least.

177
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,957
Publicity, again.

178
00:11:12,997 --> 00:11:15,837
Well, tell them I'll call them
back... again.

179
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:17,877
We'll get back to you.

180
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,237
Thank you.

181
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,237
Kenny, the lasses.

182
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:23,717
Friends, any fallings out?

183
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,317
Oh, Kelman, before you go,

184
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:29,197
phone records, social network sites.

185
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:31,077
Yes, ma'am.

186
00:11:31,117 --> 00:11:33,117
What have we got?

187
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:35,157
Abductor with wrong-sized feet.

188
00:11:37,077 --> 00:11:39,077
Enters the house, front door open.

189
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:40,757
Interrupted by Dad.

190
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:43,837
Dirty great scuffle,
two shots fired,

191
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:46,117
one wild, one through the skull.

192
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:48,157
Grabs the girls and takes off.

193
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:51,757
It's not exactly well planned,
is it?

194
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,637
Any update on the courier,
who sent the photo?

195
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:59,317
The delivery company goes by
the name of PLH Express.

196
00:11:59,357 --> 00:12:01,357
Nothing from their head office.

197
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:05,037
The bike was paid for in cash.
No name or address.

198
00:12:05,077 --> 00:12:07,877
A list of local photographers
on my desk first thing.

199
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,917
Joe, what have we got from Laura?

200
00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:12,637
Just a few names friends, family,
colleagues.

201
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:14,557
Nothing stands out,
but there is this.

202
00:12:14,597 --> 00:12:15,677
What is this?

203
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:22,397
Baghdad.

204
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:24,437
That face.

205
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:30,517
It's her.

206
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:34,317
What's this?

207
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:39,357
Mira.

208
00:13:09,224 --> 00:13:11,224
So this much we know.

209
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:14,651
Amira Saleh.

210
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:17,991
Born and raised in Akashat in Iraq.

211
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,831
5,000.

212
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:21,776
Think Newbiggin with pomegranates.

213
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:26,336
Dad's a baker, clearly gets on with
his wife, seven kids.

214
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:28,336
Drops dead of a heart attack.

215
00:13:28,376 --> 00:13:32,616
Very sad. Family up-sticks to
Baghdad, looking for an honest trade.

216
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:34,336
Whereupon...

217
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:37,696
Boom! One stray bomb.

218
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:43,216
Some American pilot can't tell
a chicken farm
from a munitions factory.

219
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,256
Whole family dead.

220
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:47,936
All except one little bairn.

221
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:51,736
Six and three-quarters, mammy's
little helper.

222
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:57,216
Ruptured pancreas, kidney failure,
extensive burns.

223
00:13:57,256 --> 00:13:59,256
Multiple fractures.

224
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,296
Aye, little Amira.

225
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:03,816
Ah, now you remember, Kenny!

226
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:05,696
That photo.

227
00:14:05,736 --> 00:14:07,736
It was hard to miss it.

228
00:14:07,776 --> 00:14:10,456
Those big eyes practically sank
the war effort.

229
00:14:11,496 --> 00:14:15,056
Plus, a national press photo award
for the lucky snapper.

230
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:19,096
This little lass became the nation's
sweetheart, didn't she?

231
00:14:19,136 --> 00:14:21,136
PR machine went into overdrive.

232
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:22,216
Joe.

233
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:27,136
Messages of support
poured in from around the world

234
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:32,056
as brave Amira was flown by RAF
Chinook yesterday to Manchester
Children's Hospital,

235
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:37,576
where doctors worked through the
night to save the life of a little
girl of unbelievable courage.

236
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:40,336
We're at the beginning of a long
road with Amira.

237
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:42,336
But she's stable, she's sleeping.

238
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:44,376
We've done all we can.

239
00:14:45,656 --> 00:14:48,176
What she needs now is all the luck
in the world.

240
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:50,216
Daniel Marsden.

241
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,256
Senior consultant at the hospital.

242
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:54,296
Our murder victim.

243
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:58,016
What about the lass?
He adopted her.

244
00:14:58,056 --> 00:15:01,936
Amira?
Amira became Mira...

245
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:03,816
Marsden.

246
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:06,856
And our killer...

247
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:10,416
shoots the dad,
runs off with the girls.

248
00:15:11,976 --> 00:15:13,616
So, what do you think?

249
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:16,416
Just a heads up,

250
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:18,456
Kenny, it might not be relevant.

251
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,336
So what I need is a motive.

252
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:24,496
Oh, Kelman, what did you get
from the hospital?

253
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:26,736
Oh, they all spoke
really highly of him.

254
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:28,776
He's dead.

255
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:30,376
They would.

256
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:34,136
Right, er... well... he was
a workaholic...

257
00:15:34,176 --> 00:15:36,176
private, people looked up to him.

258
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:38,056
Much like yourself, ma'am.

259
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,896
Well, thanks very much, Kenny.

260
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:43,576
You can stick that on my gravestone.

261
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,416
Looking forward to it.

262
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:48,456
Is she always like that?

263
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:53,136
Cheer up, mate. You're in
what they call the honeymoon phase.

264
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:10,776
It's probably nothing
but I found these in Mira's bedroom.

265
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:13,616
Strewth!

266
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:15,656
Get Anti-Terrorism on the line.

267
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:17,216
Very funny.

268
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:20,576
They were stuffed in a rucksack
in the back of her wardrobe.

269
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:25,776
No harm in asking.

270
00:16:38,856 --> 00:16:40,856
We think these are yours.

271
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:46,256
This er... this young woman.

272
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,296
She borrowed these.

273
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:51,656
Her and her sister have been
abducted.

274
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:04,976
Their poor mother.

275
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:07,416
We were wondering if you'd had
any contact.

276
00:17:09,936 --> 00:17:12,696
This young woman... is she at school
or...?

277
00:17:12,736 --> 00:17:14,216
Newton College.

278
00:17:15,096 --> 00:17:17,096
I think I can explain.

279
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:20,936
We visited the school
for an assembly.

280
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:22,976
This was in September.

281
00:17:23,936 --> 00:17:25,736
She er...

282
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:28,936
She came by the next week,
wanting to know more.

283
00:17:28,976 --> 00:17:30,976
We lent her some books.

284
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,016
We?

285
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:34,056
From the library.

286
00:17:38,136 --> 00:17:40,136
It was on the news.

287
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:42,176
Aye.

288
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:44,216
Excuse me.

289
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:48,656
Yeah?

290
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:51,576
OK.

291
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:52,976
Thanks.

292
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:56,336
Possible sighting.

293
00:17:58,016 --> 00:18:00,576
Well, if you think of anything
else...

294
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:03,176
Sure.

295
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:06,296
She'll be OK.

296
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:09,136
Thanks for your time.

297
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:14,616
Tyre tracks are a positive match
for the ones on the Marsdens' drive.

298
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:16,096
Footprints?

299
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,416
Same deal as before.
Left foot's a seven.

300
00:18:18,456 --> 00:18:20,456
Right a nine.

301
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:22,496
OK, well...

302
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,536
it's him.

303
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:26,696
Who wears different-sized boots?

304
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:28,736
Do they dress in the dark or what?

305
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:29,776
Hey.

306
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:31,616
Here comes our star witness.

307
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:33,656
Are you here to see DCI Stanhope?

308
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,816
Good grief!
Tell me it's not the bairn.

309
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:40,416
Right, OK, Meg, and this was when?

310
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:43,056
Hm?

311
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:47,696
Just gone 11 last night.

312
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:49,776
Well, you seem very sure.

313
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:54,456
Ah, we were walking Gran here home,
were we?

314
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:57,736
Aye, home from the pub.

315
00:18:57,776 --> 00:18:59,536
She likes to keep us company.

316
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:01,576
Yeah, I bet she does.

317
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:05,416
Come on, then, love, tell us what
you saw. Come on.

318
00:19:05,456 --> 00:19:06,896
It was a man, right?

319
00:19:07,736 --> 00:19:10,136
Aye, a fella and two women.

320
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:13,256
This fella, can you remember
what he looked like?

321
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:16,976
Just take your time.

322
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:19,776
His hair was black.

323
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,816
Are you sure? It was very dark.

324
00:19:22,616 --> 00:19:24,416
I don't suppose you saw any of this?

325
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,336
I cannae say I did.

326
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:27,896
No.

327
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:29,936
And the two women?

328
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,856
That was them.

329
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:34,696
And how did they seem?

330
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:36,176
OK?

331
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,616
One of them was drunk.

332
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:40,136
Drunk?

333
00:19:40,176 --> 00:19:42,176
She kept falling over.

334
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,296
Mira?

335
00:19:44,336 --> 00:19:47,496
The man was yelling at her.

336
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:50,656
He got really mad.

337
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:52,656
What did he say?

338
00:19:52,696 --> 00:19:54,696
'Wake up, it's me.'

339
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:03,096
'Wake up.' Like they were half
asleep or drugged?

340
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:09,656
Or... 'Wake up, snap out of it.
It's me.' Like he knew her.

341
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:12,256
He kidnaps the girls at 5pm.

342
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:15,496
He's still here six hours later,
still knocking about the Northeast.

343
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:18,536
Well, maybe he's local.

344
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:20,376
It's Kenny.

345
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,016
He's got an address for that lass's
photographer.

346
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:37,536
Family portrait, passport photo?

347
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:39,816
Mother and son?

348
00:20:41,696 --> 00:20:43,696
No, no, I'm the landlady.

349
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:46,016
Good for you. Your secret's safe
with me.

350
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:48,416
Thank you. Bye-bye.
Thanks. Jonah Regan?

351
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,536
Yeah.

352
00:20:49,576 --> 00:20:52,216
DCI Vera Stanhope,
Northumberland and City Police.

353
00:20:53,096 --> 00:20:55,816
Oh, yes, the phone call.
Right.

354
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:58,696
Did you take this?

355
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,216
Yeah.

356
00:21:01,256 --> 00:21:04,056
Right, what we need from you...
Of course.

357
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,936
Who commissioned the photos.

358
00:21:05,976 --> 00:21:08,816
That's right.
The girls. Erm...

359
00:21:09,816 --> 00:21:11,816
Marianne, was it, and...?

360
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:14,056
Karen.
Correct.

361
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:17,296
And did they say why
they were having their photos taken?

362
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:19,336
Birthday pressie, Dad or...

363
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:20,776
Poor sod, eh?

364
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:22,816
I saw him on the news, it's...

365
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:26,376
I just said I'd package up the
photos and send them to the house.

366
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:30,336
Thanks very much.

367
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:41,936
That war photo of Amira in Baghdad.

368
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:44,576
What was the name
of the photographer? Why?

369
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:48,496
Didn't you see it? Pride of place,
National Photojournalism Award.

370
00:21:48,536 --> 00:21:50,536
Come on, hurry up, things to do.

371
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:53,496
Can't hang around here all day,
waiting for Google.

372
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:02,736
Jonah Regan.

373
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,056
Never write off the landlady.

374
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:36,088
Oh, here he is.

375
00:22:36,142 --> 00:22:38,142
Him and his size nines.

376
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,435
Search warrant for the flat,
Mr Regan.

377
00:22:40,475 --> 00:22:42,475
You might need a solicitor.

378
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:47,575
I've already told you. I had a night
in, I woke up with a hangover.

379
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:49,375
Nobody saw you.

380
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:51,055
I know.

381
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:57,215
If you are withholding something
from my investigation, that is a
criminal offence,

382
00:22:57,255 --> 00:22:58,975
Mr Regan.

383
00:23:00,415 --> 00:23:02,335
Now, then, Belfast...

384
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,055
Sarajevo...

385
00:23:04,095 --> 00:23:05,815
Libya...

386
00:23:07,615 --> 00:23:09,975
Somalia?
Rwanda.

387
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,855
It does something to your head,
does it, in the end?

388
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:18,015
If you tell me what you're looking
for, maybe I can help.

389
00:23:18,055 --> 00:23:20,055
Three months divorced...

390
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:22,095
not even.

391
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:24,775
Your ex-wife... Jennifer, is it?

392
00:23:24,815 --> 00:23:29,175
And your ex-son, Liam, aged 12...

393
00:23:29,215 --> 00:23:32,135
Mr Regan's family history's
not under review here.

394
00:23:32,175 --> 00:23:34,175
You relocate 80 miles up the coast,

395
00:23:35,175 --> 00:23:37,655
just a ten-minute drive
from that man.

396
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:40,815
I'm sorry, you've lost me.
What are you talking about?

397
00:23:41,455 --> 00:23:43,255
One photo.

398
00:23:44,415 --> 00:23:46,815
Now, we've done a little bit of
checking up.

399
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:52,655
How long was it you spent trying to
adopt that same little girl?

400
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:54,695
Eight months?

401
00:23:56,015 --> 00:23:58,975
Now, what was it the adoption
service said?

402
00:24:00,655 --> 00:24:01,975
Here we are.

403
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:03,935
'Applicant required to travel for
work.'

404
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:07,495
I swore I'd pack all that in.
'Episodes of manic depression.

405
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,855
Domestic situation considered...'

406
00:24:10,895 --> 00:24:12,895
Unstable.
Yeah.

407
00:24:14,255 --> 00:24:16,655
Bet you know it off by heart,
do you?

408
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:24,295
Whereas Dr Daniel Marsden
ticked every box known to man.

409
00:24:25,455 --> 00:24:27,455
He beat you to it.

410
00:24:27,495 --> 00:24:29,935
He got the girl... little Mira.

411
00:24:29,975 --> 00:24:31,815
Amira.

412
00:24:31,855 --> 00:24:33,855
Yeah, something like that.

413
00:24:33,895 --> 00:24:35,895
Hard to let go of.

414
00:24:37,095 --> 00:24:38,255
Hm.

415
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,375
Spent ten years festering, hm?

416
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:46,535
Jonah, tell me...

417
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:49,975
how did you convince Mira and her
kid sister to pose for those photos?

418
00:24:57,975 --> 00:25:00,575
I met them on the way
to the bus stop.

419
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:04,495
I told them I was new to the area,
drumming up trade.

420
00:25:05,335 --> 00:25:08,815
'You put out a bit of word of mouth
and I'll do the job for free.'

421
00:25:09,735 --> 00:25:10,935
Why?

422
00:25:11,935 --> 00:25:13,455
To see her.

423
00:25:14,335 --> 00:25:16,335
To see what she'd become.

424
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:19,455
That's it.

425
00:25:19,495 --> 00:25:21,495
The two girls are taken,

426
00:25:21,535 --> 00:25:23,535
their father murdered.

427
00:25:23,575 --> 00:25:27,495
An hour later, your photos of the
girls turn up at the house.

428
00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:29,617
What's that all about, then?

429
00:25:29,657 --> 00:25:31,257
A little tap dance?

430
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:33,297
A declaration of war?

431
00:25:33,337 --> 00:25:34,697
What?

432
00:25:34,737 --> 00:25:36,737
Crap timing, that's all.

433
00:25:38,697 --> 00:25:41,657
Still, it's quite ironic, isn't it?

434
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:43,697
Oh, is it?
Well, I mean...

435
00:25:43,737 --> 00:25:46,457
if you think back to Baghdad, house
flattened...

436
00:25:47,497 --> 00:25:50,577
the whole of her family in bits,
and I mean in bits...

437
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:53,737
because I was the one
that was actually there, remember?

438
00:25:55,977 --> 00:25:57,977
And now it's like...

439
00:25:58,017 --> 00:26:00,097
It's all come full circle,
hasn't it?

440
00:26:01,297 --> 00:26:05,897
Marsden couldn't be any more screwed
if they put an exocet through his
front window.

441
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:08,937
You can crow all you like, Mr Regan.

442
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:11,697
But spare the girls.

443
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,737
I wish I could.

444
00:26:14,497 --> 00:26:16,297
Where are they?

445
00:26:17,937 --> 00:26:19,937
I've got to get back to work.

446
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:23,497
Unless you have any evidence
with which to charge my client...

447
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,697
All right.

448
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:33,777
Interview terminated, 14:27.

449
00:26:39,617 --> 00:26:41,297
Want a lift?

450
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:44,577
No chance.

451
00:27:19,177 --> 00:27:21,697
Ballistics report, second page,
third para.

452
00:27:25,897 --> 00:27:27,217
Passport.

453
00:27:27,257 --> 00:27:29,257
We're gonna need his passport.

454
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:46,897
Joe!

455
00:27:46,937 --> 00:27:49,017
Your wee lass from Hexham
last night.

456
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:53,057
What time did she see the girls?

457
00:27:53,097 --> 00:27:55,097
11 o'clock, closing time. Why?

458
00:27:57,297 --> 00:27:58,977
What's that?

459
00:27:59,017 --> 00:28:01,017
Check it out.

460
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:04,497
Check if it was Regan.

461
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,457
Somebody open this door!

462
00:28:15,897 --> 00:28:17,617
Is this your shop?
Aye.

463
00:28:17,657 --> 00:28:19,217
Do you work here?
Aye.

464
00:28:20,297 --> 00:28:22,297
Do you recognise this man?

465
00:28:22,337 --> 00:28:24,617
'I've told you, I haven't got them.'

466
00:28:25,257 --> 00:28:31,297
We found traces of sand residue on
the shells of the bullets fired
at Dr Marsden.

467
00:28:32,057 --> 00:28:36,057
And our ballistics lab reckons
that this and other factors

468
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:38,737
points to an origin in Iraq or Syria.

469
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:39,777
Iraq?

470
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:42,057
Know what this is?

471
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:43,697
A 9mm semi.

472
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:46,697
Half the male population of Baghdad
have got one of them.

473
00:28:46,737 --> 00:28:49,497
You were there yourself in October
last year, doing what?

474
00:28:49,537 --> 00:28:51,017
For work.

475
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:54,337
I've still got contacts.
A bloke at Magnum likes what I do.

476
00:28:54,377 --> 00:28:56,377
It's a photo agency.

477
00:28:57,217 --> 00:28:59,217
Bring one home with you?

478
00:28:59,257 --> 00:29:00,297
No!

479
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:02,337
Why are you doing all this?

480
00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:05,217
It's the dream, is it,

481
00:29:05,257 --> 00:29:06,777
your line of work?

482
00:29:06,817 --> 00:29:08,817
One shot that changed the world.

483
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:10,857
And what did I change?

484
00:29:11,457 --> 00:29:13,337
You saved her life.

485
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,377
I found her, that's all.

486
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:17,417
I took her hand, and they said,

487
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:20,857
'Don't, for Christ's sake.
You pull her, you'll break her.'

488
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:22,897
And I couldn't do that.

489
00:29:22,937 --> 00:29:24,937
I'd kill any man that did.

490
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:31,817
These are the last Baghdad trip?

491
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:33,577
Yes.

492
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:36,737
What's this?

493
00:29:38,497 --> 00:29:41,057
Amira's street, once upon a time.

494
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,497
Well, what were you doing there?

495
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:46,257
Just trying to join things up,
I guess.

496
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,057
Cheery lot.

497
00:29:53,097 --> 00:29:55,137
That was Amira's house.

498
00:29:55,177 --> 00:29:57,537
Nowadays just full of
dental students.

499
00:29:57,577 --> 00:29:58,657
Hm.

500
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,697
Car mechanic.

501
00:30:00,737 --> 00:30:02,977
He took a pounding
in the Occupation.

502
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:05,017
Six broken ribs.

503
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:07,977
Half his foot blown off,
burns to his face and arms.

504
00:30:08,017 --> 00:30:10,017
He remembered her, though, Amira.

505
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:12,137
From the old days.

506
00:30:13,217 --> 00:30:14,337
Kenny?

507
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:17,697
Off licence till receipt,
just gone 11 o'clock last night.

508
00:30:17,737 --> 00:30:20,057
The shop owner remembers Regan
coming in.

509
00:30:20,097 --> 00:30:22,977
That puts him 20 miles
from the sighting in Hexham.

510
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:26,057
He can't be in two places at once
now, can he?

511
00:30:28,737 --> 00:30:30,217
You were saying?

512
00:30:30,257 --> 00:30:32,857
His injuries,
how did he come by them?

513
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:35,577
Missile attack, I think.

514
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:37,417
And his leg, his foot?

515
00:30:37,457 --> 00:30:39,457
Yeah, toes blown off.

516
00:30:39,497 --> 00:30:41,497
What, both feet?
No, just one.

517
00:30:43,897 --> 00:30:45,897
Left foot?
Yeah.

518
00:30:46,657 --> 00:30:48,657
Right's a nine, the left's a seven.

519
00:30:50,497 --> 00:30:52,497
Now, he remembered Amira?

520
00:30:52,537 --> 00:30:54,177
Right?
Yeah.

521
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:56,417
He was asking about her.
What did he want to know?

522
00:30:56,457 --> 00:30:58,537
What had happened to her,
her name...

523
00:30:58,577 --> 00:31:00,577
What, her new name?

524
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:02,617
Mira Marsden?

525
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:06,217
And you told him, Mr Regan?

526
00:31:07,817 --> 00:31:09,617
You told him?

527
00:31:11,857 --> 00:31:13,497
Yeah.

528
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:26,897
Please... I don't know
what you're talking about.

529
00:31:32,377 --> 00:31:34,377
Just let us go home.

530
00:31:44,097 --> 00:31:45,897
Oh, no.

531
00:31:51,657 --> 00:31:52,977
Hello.

532
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:55,017
Malik, no surname.

533
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:58,577
Lived in the same neighbourhood in
Baghdad.

534
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:02,297
The left foot, size seven,
the right, size nine.

535
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,457
Where are you?

536
00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:07,497
Oh, God in heaven!

537
00:32:25,257 --> 00:32:27,257
Next time, take off your shoes.

538
00:32:30,497 --> 00:32:32,817
one man working alone.

539
00:32:34,377 --> 00:32:37,217
But he knew her as a child in
Baghdad.

540
00:32:37,897 --> 00:32:39,897
And she's spirited over here.

541
00:32:39,937 --> 00:32:42,937
Years go by, now he wants to find
her again.

542
00:32:42,977 --> 00:32:44,977
Hey, it's a long shot.

543
00:32:45,017 --> 00:32:47,017
I mean, why?

544
00:32:49,057 --> 00:32:51,057
That's some bairn he met years back.

545
00:32:51,097 --> 00:32:54,057
I don't know, but park the 'why'.
Think 'how'.

546
00:32:55,777 --> 00:32:58,257
I mean, I'm sorry to piss on
your chips, yeah,

547
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,097
but some guy, some mechanic
from Iraq,

548
00:33:01,137 --> 00:33:03,137
how do we know he's here?

549
00:33:04,537 --> 00:33:06,537
How does he even get here?

550
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:11,257
They sometimes come over in lorries
on the ferry from Holland.

551
00:33:11,297 --> 00:33:14,817
This... Malik, is it? They could have
smuggled him overland across Europe.

552
00:33:14,857 --> 00:33:17,137
Since when did you become the big
expert?

553
00:33:17,177 --> 00:33:19,177
I've got a mate in SOCA...

554
00:33:19,217 --> 00:33:21,217
Well, more of an ex, actually.

555
00:33:21,577 --> 00:33:23,577
Do you keep in touch with your ex?

556
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:27,937
Yeah, you know. Keep your enemies
close, keep your exes closer.

557
00:33:27,977 --> 00:33:29,137
Right, Joe?

558
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:33,137
Don't ask him. He's been hitched
since he was at primary school.

559
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,977
One-woman guy, is it?

560
00:33:35,017 --> 00:33:37,017
I like it.
Oh, hypocrite!

561
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,377
Shall I give her a buzz?

562
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,417
Yeah, use my office, if you like.

563
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:50,177
Very resourceful.

564
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:53,217
Aye, they said he was cocky.

565
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:57,297
A friend of mine did firearms
training with him last year.

566
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:59,337
They used to call him Dirty Barry.

567
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:03,097
I think he wants a pen, pet.
Would you mind?

568
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:11,097
Kelman, you can wait in reception.

569
00:34:14,537 --> 00:34:18,537
Gary Webb. Customs official taking
bribes on the docks.

570
00:34:18,577 --> 00:34:21,457
We've had him under surveillance
since February.

571
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:25,577
We hoped he'd take us to the
Albanians working this stretch of
the coast.

572
00:34:25,617 --> 00:34:28,457
Still... you're the priority.

573
00:34:28,497 --> 00:34:30,497
You made the national news.

574
00:34:30,537 --> 00:34:35,177
So you think this customs official
might have let our suspect into the
country?

575
00:34:35,217 --> 00:34:36,817
Amongst others.

576
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:39,377
Well, let's go pick him up.

577
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,417
Time's up, sweetheart.

578
00:34:52,777 --> 00:34:54,777
OK, go. On you go, Luke.

579
00:34:54,817 --> 00:34:57,297
OK, there you go.
Get those muscles working!

580
00:34:57,337 --> 00:35:00,257
You can do it! Yeah!

581
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:02,577
Well done. That's it, a bit further.

582
00:35:07,337 --> 00:35:08,777
Gary.

583
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:23,554
So hypothetically...

584
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:27,714
you looked into the back of the
freight, yes?

585
00:35:27,754 --> 00:35:29,754
What did you see?

586
00:35:32,554 --> 00:35:36,154
Oh, please, help me out here for
Christ's sakes.

587
00:35:42,354 --> 00:35:43,954
Hypothetically.

588
00:35:54,474 --> 00:35:55,794
I er...

589
00:35:57,794 --> 00:35:59,794
I didn't see much.

590
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:06,994
This man, hm?

591
00:36:13,194 --> 00:36:15,174
I mean, faces,
it could have been him.

592
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:18,038
Mr Webb, this man's not here
for a spot of bar work.

593
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:21,518
A man is dead
and his two daughters are missing.

594
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:23,558
One of them's diabetic.

595
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,278
His daughters?

596
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:27,158
Mm.

597
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:30,118
Two nights in the back of a van.

598
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:32,158
God knows what he wants with them.

599
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,158
Eyes down.

600
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:45,118
Yeah.

601
00:36:45,158 --> 00:36:47,158
He was there.

602
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:50,838
He had bad skin, burns on his face.

603
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:52,878
OK, so...

604
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,878
where is he now?

605
00:36:57,598 --> 00:37:00,198
We have confirmation on a face.

606
00:37:00,238 --> 00:37:02,238
A photograph.

607
00:37:02,278 --> 00:37:04,078
Malik.

608
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:06,838
He was smuggled into the country
last weekend.

609
00:37:06,878 --> 00:37:09,958
Now, we're still light years away
from a motive.

610
00:37:11,038 --> 00:37:17,038
But what drives a man to travel
halfway round the world to go
ballistic?

611
00:37:18,878 --> 00:37:20,878
What would be enough?

612
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:52,318
Ma'am.
Thanks, love. Where is she?

613
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:53,598
She's upstairs.

614
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:57,038
No, don't panic, love.
There's no news.

615
00:37:57,678 --> 00:37:59,878
I just wanted to ask you
a little favour.

616
00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:01,918
Oh, OK.

617
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:03,878
Oh, erm...

618
00:38:03,918 --> 00:38:05,918
Sorry, this is...

619
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,798
DCI Stanhope.

620
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:09,838
Robin Creavey.
That's Karen's...

621
00:38:09,878 --> 00:38:11,398
Godfather.

622
00:38:11,438 --> 00:38:13,198
Dan's oldest friend.

623
00:38:13,238 --> 00:38:15,878
I should drop by the house,
check the lights still work.

624
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,438
Don't go. You must be jetlagged.
Sure.

625
00:38:18,478 --> 00:38:20,878
If I could just borrow her
for five minutes.

626
00:38:30,278 --> 00:38:33,598
I remember we were in France
one time.

627
00:38:33,638 --> 00:38:35,638
We packed in a hurry, no insulin.

628
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:38,798
It was a bank holiday, everything
was shut.

629
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:40,958
She went two days
without her insulin.

630
00:38:41,878 --> 00:38:45,358
Her legs just went from under her.
I thought we were...

631
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:49,758
Keep drinking, plenty of fluids,
that's what Dan always...

632
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:52,678
Listen, her sister's with her.

633
00:38:53,918 --> 00:38:56,398
I know it's nuts,
I feel glad it's two of them.

634
00:38:56,438 --> 00:38:58,438
At least they're together.

635
00:38:58,478 --> 00:39:00,798
At least she's got Karen to look
after her.

636
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,838
She'll know what to do, Karen.

637
00:39:02,878 --> 00:39:04,878
Oh, there I go.

638
00:39:04,918 --> 00:39:06,918
Dan was always ticking me off.

639
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,958
Said I put too much on her.

640
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:10,998
And what do you say?

641
00:39:11,878 --> 00:39:13,518
I don't know.

642
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,598
I wish I had a fraction of
her strength.

643
00:39:21,998 --> 00:39:25,318
Anything we do still have
would be up here in storage.

644
00:39:30,718 --> 00:39:32,558
We kept it safe.

645
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:36,918
You know, in case she needed to go
into all that.

646
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:40,158
Not that she did, she's very
comfortable in her own skin.

647
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,638
Actually, it's... It's not locked.

648
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:47,598
Oh.

649
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,958
This is what they found her in.

650
00:40:04,998 --> 00:40:09,718
It's hard to believe something so
small could have so much pain.

651
00:40:15,638 --> 00:40:17,638
Here, drink this.

652
00:40:28,598 --> 00:40:30,598
You'll be all right.

653
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:41,718
Right, there's some...
old photos here somewhere.

654
00:40:41,758 --> 00:40:43,758
And this is it?

655
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:47,558
This is all there is of Amira's
old life?

656
00:40:47,598 --> 00:40:49,198
Mira. We dropped the A.

657
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,838
Mira, sorry.

658
00:40:50,878 --> 00:40:55,638
It's hard to credit now the
publicity around that child,
TV, book deals.

659
00:40:55,678 --> 00:40:57,678
'No, thanks, ' Dan said.

660
00:40:58,118 --> 00:41:00,118
New life, new start, new name.

661
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:01,838
Laura...

662
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:05,158
I think this man was looking for
your daughter.

663
00:41:06,078 --> 00:41:08,078
He knows her new name, Mira Marsden,

664
00:41:08,118 --> 00:41:11,718
and he arrived in Tyneside the night
before the attack on your family.

665
00:41:11,758 --> 00:41:14,318
It's him?
I think so, yes.

666
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:15,838
Who is he?

667
00:41:15,878 --> 00:41:18,278
I was hoping you could help us
with that.

668
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:19,638
Me?

669
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:20,678
Mm.

670
00:41:20,718 --> 00:41:22,718
Oh, if I had those photos...

671
00:41:22,758 --> 00:41:24,758
They must be here somewhere.

672
00:41:24,798 --> 00:41:29,798
Laura, I'm gonna have to ask, has
anyone from Mira's old life
ever made contact?

673
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:31,198
What?

674
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,678
Her what?

675
00:41:32,718 --> 00:41:35,918
Iraq, Baghdad. If not with yourself,
with your husband.

676
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,158
No.

677
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:40,118
How could they?
I mean, how could they?

678
00:41:41,798 --> 00:41:43,998
Look, I'm not judging anybody.

679
00:41:44,038 --> 00:41:46,038
They're saying it's a man from Iraq.

680
00:41:46,078 --> 00:41:48,078
Iraq? How can that be?

681
00:41:48,118 --> 00:41:50,398
That's what I said.
We don't know yet.

682
00:41:50,438 --> 00:41:52,438
Come on, let's get you inside.

683
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,678
Any use?

684
00:42:13,718 --> 00:42:17,638
No, not a lot of stuff left behind.

685
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:23,078
Malik.

686
00:42:24,158 --> 00:42:27,638
If we just had a surname,
we could contact the Foreign Office.

687
00:42:29,478 --> 00:42:31,598
Here's Robin Creavey, the godfather.

688
00:42:35,238 --> 00:42:38,958
I meant to ask, did you... give
any thought to your dad's little
surprise?

689
00:42:38,998 --> 00:42:40,238
Eh?

690
00:42:40,278 --> 00:42:41,838
Your kid sister.

691
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:45,958
You kept these quiet!

692
00:42:45,998 --> 00:42:48,998
Yeah, well, I missed my breakfast.
It's gone lunch!

693
00:42:49,798 --> 00:42:51,798
Go on, help yourself.

694
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,518
Mm.

695
00:42:58,118 --> 00:43:00,598
She's just some stranger with a life
of her own.

696
00:43:02,278 --> 00:43:04,718
This whole thing
we've got something in common.

697
00:43:04,758 --> 00:43:07,158
She might have looked me up,
I'm in the phone book.

698
00:43:07,198 --> 00:43:08,798
No, you're not.

699
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:12,118
If she needed to find me,
she knows where I am, doesn't she?

700
00:43:12,158 --> 00:43:14,158
Does she have a name, at least?

701
00:43:14,198 --> 00:43:15,678
Name?

702
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,598
Who?
Your sister!

703
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:19,638
Oh! How should I know?

704
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:30,238
Just answer the phone normally.

705
00:43:32,598 --> 00:43:34,958
Hello?
Mum? Is that you?

706
00:43:36,598 --> 00:43:38,998
Triangulate the phone now.
Are you there, Mum?

707
00:43:39,038 --> 00:43:41,038
Ma'am, there's a call.
Karen?

708
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:43,958
Sweetheart...

709
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:46,678
Oh, Mum! Oh, thank God!
What's happening to us?

710
00:43:46,718 --> 00:43:48,718
Just tell me where you are, love.

711
00:43:48,758 --> 00:43:52,438
It's some kind of giant greenhouse.
There's plants everywhere.

712
00:43:52,478 --> 00:43:55,118
Is your sister with you?
Put Mira on. I'm really scared.

713
00:43:55,158 --> 00:43:57,158
Karen?

714
00:44:00,998 --> 00:44:03,118
Phone battery must have died.

715
00:44:03,158 --> 00:44:05,278
But we can get a fix.

716
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:07,318
Let me come.

717
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:10,158
No, you stay here.
Joe, Kelman, you stay with her.

718
00:44:10,278 --> 00:44:12,038
You follow me.

719
00:44:21,518 --> 00:44:24,838
OK, Kenny, where is she?
Head west out of Ammington.

720
00:44:24,878 --> 00:44:27,038
Ammington?
Correct.

721
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:29,078
But it's on our doorstep!

722
00:44:33,518 --> 00:44:35,518
Plants, plants...

723
00:44:35,558 --> 00:44:39,638
Kenny, any garden centres,
market gardens, anything?

724
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:44,118
Aye, there's polytunnels.
Plastic City.

725
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:48,358
Where's Armed Response?

726
00:44:48,398 --> 00:44:49,958
15 minutes away.

727
00:44:49,998 --> 00:44:52,278
What are we supposed to do,
sit and wait?

728
00:44:56,878 --> 00:44:58,878
We'll just start.

729
00:44:59,758 --> 00:45:01,478
Spread out.

730
00:45:29,918 --> 00:45:31,038
Yeah.

731
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:33,958
I just want to hear your voice.

732
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:49,278
And the little 'uns.

733
00:45:57,358 --> 00:45:59,358
Yeah, I'll have to call you back.

734
00:45:59,398 --> 00:46:00,838
Laura?

735
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:03,798
Mrs Marsden?

736
00:46:21,438 --> 00:46:22,838
Kelman, come in.

737
00:46:22,878 --> 00:46:25,798
I need back-up now at the house.
I think he's inside.

738
00:46:34,438 --> 00:46:38,798
Officer on the scene. White Ford
van, registration R430 UOC.

739
00:46:42,838 --> 00:46:44,478
Joe, there's no key.

740
00:46:44,518 --> 00:46:46,598
He's upstairs! Have a look upstairs.

741
00:46:48,998 --> 00:46:51,558
Police officer.
Put down your weapon!

742
00:47:07,078 --> 00:47:08,598
Help!

743
00:47:09,878 --> 00:47:11,318
Help!

744
00:47:46,158 --> 00:47:47,758
Help me!

745
00:47:53,798 --> 00:47:56,318
It's all right, love.
Where is he, Karen?

746
00:47:56,718 --> 00:47:58,198
He's gone.

747
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:01,838
And where's your sister?
Where's Mira? My mum...

748
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,558
Paramedic!

749
00:48:06,878 --> 00:48:08,878
Barry, hold on.

750
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:09,998
Laura...

751
00:48:10,038 --> 00:48:13,198
Laura, come here. Look at me.
Stay with me, Laura.

752
00:48:15,758 --> 00:48:17,758
Look at me. Stay with me, Laura.

753
00:48:17,798 --> 00:48:19,798
Stay with me.

754
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:22,318
Stay with me!

755
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:44,695
Kenny, come on.

756
00:48:53,855 --> 00:48:55,855
Did Kelman get a shot off?

757
00:48:55,895 --> 00:48:57,375
Aye.

758
00:48:57,415 --> 00:48:59,415
He must have clipped the intruder.

759
00:48:59,455 --> 00:49:03,975
The blood spatter starts in the
house, all the way down here,
over to the vehicle.

760
00:49:04,015 --> 00:49:06,015
Get ANPR on the number plates.

761
00:49:06,055 --> 00:49:07,535
Ma'am.

762
00:49:10,535 --> 00:49:12,535
Would you like me to tell his wife?

763
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,575
He had a wife?

764
00:49:15,975 --> 00:49:17,975
No, she already knows.

765
00:49:18,015 --> 00:49:19,615
Right.

766
00:49:19,655 --> 00:49:22,055
Listen, I want to ring round
the hospitals.

767
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:25,815
If Malik's wounded...
maybe he checked into A&E, right?

768
00:49:25,855 --> 00:49:27,855
I'll drop you off.

769
00:49:39,735 --> 00:49:41,415
How's Mam?

770
00:49:41,455 --> 00:49:43,575
They don't know.
Still in theatre?

771
00:49:43,615 --> 00:49:45,495
OK.

772
00:49:50,415 --> 00:49:51,855
Listen, love...

773
00:49:51,895 --> 00:49:54,375
did he keep you anywhere else?

774
00:49:54,415 --> 00:49:56,375
In a barn.

775
00:49:56,415 --> 00:49:58,855
In a barn.
Anything you can remember, sounds...?

776
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:00,375
No.

777
00:50:03,775 --> 00:50:05,775
Hey, how are you holding up?

778
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:10,375
Me dad, you know, and...

779
00:50:10,415 --> 00:50:12,015
now this and...

780
00:50:12,055 --> 00:50:13,695
It's all my fault.

781
00:50:13,735 --> 00:50:15,735
No.
I didn't mean it.

782
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:21,895
Mira was getting dead poorly and I
told the man, 'She needs her shot,
the proper dose.'

783
00:50:23,215 --> 00:50:27,415
What, are you saying he went back
to the house to get your sister's
insulin?

784
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,895
Yeah.

785
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:33,055
Wait here, pet.

786
00:50:40,335 --> 00:50:41,735
Progress?

787
00:50:41,775 --> 00:50:45,495
Because I can always have a word
with the Assistant Commissioner.

788
00:50:45,535 --> 00:50:47,535
Oh, he's in your circle, is he?

789
00:50:48,455 --> 00:50:50,455
Civil servants, we get around.

790
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,775
So if it's extra support you want,
I can call him right now.

791
00:50:53,815 --> 00:50:57,015
Sir... we lost a man today.

792
00:50:58,095 --> 00:51:01,775
So if you'd just like to take care of
Karen and leave the rest to me.

793
00:51:02,735 --> 00:51:04,735
What about this Iraqi?

794
00:51:05,735 --> 00:51:07,735
What's he doing this for?

795
00:51:39,295 --> 00:51:41,295
Jonah Regan.

796
00:51:41,335 --> 00:51:44,735
Goes to Amira's old street
in Baghdad.

797
00:51:45,455 --> 00:51:47,455
Meets a stranger, takes his photo.

798
00:51:47,495 --> 00:51:49,455
Gives him a tip-off...

799
00:51:50,815 --> 00:51:52,535
Mira Marsden.

800
00:51:53,255 --> 00:51:57,415
And Malik tracks her
all the way back here to Tyneside.

801
00:51:59,055 --> 00:52:01,055
Now, what's he doing here?

802
00:52:01,735 --> 00:52:04,375
Is that a revenge thing or what?

803
00:52:05,415 --> 00:52:08,895
Uniform took one of Mira's district
nurse team back to the house.

804
00:52:08,935 --> 00:52:12,455
She confirms that the insulin was
stored in her mum and dad's
bathroom.

805
00:52:12,495 --> 00:52:14,495
He took it, he took the medicine?

806
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:17,015
Aye, all of it, a month's supply.
A month?

807
00:52:17,055 --> 00:52:19,055
Well, he's in for the long haul.

808
00:52:20,935 --> 00:52:23,655
God, that was one hell of a risk
going back there.

809
00:52:23,695 --> 00:52:25,695
Well, at least the lassie's OK.

810
00:52:25,735 --> 00:52:27,255
Mm.

811
00:52:29,175 --> 00:52:31,175
Anything from Ballistics?

812
00:52:31,215 --> 00:52:32,975
Ah, right.

813
00:52:33,015 --> 00:52:34,975
The intruder fired first.

814
00:52:35,015 --> 00:52:38,335
The bullet struck Barry,
went straight through his chest.

815
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:40,375
Caught lower in the abdomen.

816
00:52:43,695 --> 00:52:48,695
Barry would have died a few minutes
after that, before the paramedics
got there.

817
00:52:48,735 --> 00:52:51,255
So Laura was caught in the
crossfire?

818
00:52:51,295 --> 00:52:52,895
Aye, looks like it.

819
00:52:52,935 --> 00:52:55,735
And then the intruder
went up to Laura's bedroom.

820
00:52:55,775 --> 00:52:58,455
Joe, how long before DC Kelman
got to the house?

821
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,655
Joe?

822
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:03,695
Well, we can't tell, can we?

823
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:08,135
Cos we don't know what Malik wants
or why he's here.

824
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,415
Ma'am, it's Anthea.

825
00:53:15,455 --> 00:53:17,455
DS Kelman's widow.

826
00:53:20,335 --> 00:53:23,295
Take her into my office, Kenny,
settle her down.

827
00:53:23,335 --> 00:53:25,335
I'll be right there.

828
00:53:27,255 --> 00:53:28,335
Joe?

829
00:53:34,815 --> 00:53:36,815
You OK?

830
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,335
Look at us,
there's not a scratch on us.

831
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:42,375
I let the man bleed to death.

832
00:53:42,415 --> 00:53:44,695
You saved a woman's life.

833
00:53:44,735 --> 00:53:48,015
I'm sorry, you train to be
a firearms officer,
we all know the risks.

834
00:53:48,055 --> 00:53:51,735
A fat lot of good it did her.
She's just about ready to drop.

835
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:53,775
I mean, some dad he's gonna be.

836
00:53:53,815 --> 00:53:55,055
He's a hero.

837
00:53:55,095 --> 00:53:57,095
He's a photo on the wall.

838
00:53:59,775 --> 00:54:01,775
Oh, look. What have we here?

839
00:54:04,335 --> 00:54:06,415
Did you call them?
Of course I did!

840
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:09,535
What did you do that for?
Go home, will you? Get lost.

841
00:54:14,175 --> 00:54:15,815
Hey.

842
00:54:26,095 --> 00:54:28,095
Come on, you two.

843
00:54:53,975 --> 00:54:55,775
All OK?
Yes.

844
00:54:55,815 --> 00:54:57,815
Her boyfriend's here.

845
00:54:57,855 --> 00:54:59,855
We're doing normal, or trying to.

846
00:55:03,455 --> 00:55:04,735
Hey.

847
00:55:04,775 --> 00:55:05,975
Hm.

848
00:55:13,495 --> 00:55:14,895
Karen?

849
00:55:29,175 --> 00:55:30,775
Karen?

850
00:55:40,655 --> 00:55:42,415
So who wants to order?

851
00:55:42,455 --> 00:55:44,455
Dad, we ordered ages ago.

852
00:55:44,495 --> 00:55:46,975
Let him be. He's had a tough day,
haven't you?

853
00:55:47,415 --> 00:55:49,415
Aye, a bit of a day.

854
00:55:49,455 --> 00:55:51,455
Can I have a blue one, Dad?

855
00:55:51,495 --> 00:55:53,815
Tomboy.
Can I, Dad?

856
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,815
Hey, surprise! Happy birthday.

857
00:55:56,855 --> 00:55:58,535
Happy birthday.

858
00:55:58,575 --> 00:56:00,375
We got you a little...

859
00:56:01,975 --> 00:56:05,095
The first thing I heard was
the gunshot.

860
00:56:05,135 --> 00:56:08,255
We were upstairs.
Trying on the frocks for the party.

861
00:56:08,295 --> 00:56:10,295
And you heard your dad.

862
00:56:10,335 --> 00:56:12,335
He was shouting.

863
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:14,375
He never shouts.

864
00:56:15,255 --> 00:56:17,335
There was a fight,
a table going over.

865
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:20,775
Mira runs down, there's Dad.

866
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:22,815
'Get back upstairs.'

867
00:56:22,855 --> 00:56:24,855
And it goes off.

868
00:56:24,895 --> 00:56:26,895
You saw the gun go off?

869
00:56:29,215 --> 00:56:31,215
That man, he stood there...

870
00:56:31,255 --> 00:56:33,455
like he didn't know what just
happened.

871
00:56:33,495 --> 00:56:35,895
Like somebody just put that gun in
his hand.

872
00:56:37,095 --> 00:56:39,095
'Amira, ' he says.

873
00:56:39,135 --> 00:56:41,135
Amira, like that.

874
00:56:41,175 --> 00:56:43,175
I was screaming, we both were.

875
00:56:44,975 --> 00:56:47,295
He starts trying to drag her
out the house.

876
00:56:47,335 --> 00:56:49,535
I was on the stairs,
grabbed hold of her.

877
00:56:50,695 --> 00:56:53,215
He goes mental, starts waving
the gun around.

878
00:56:53,255 --> 00:56:56,655
He's screaming at both of us,
'Get in the van, get in the van!'

879
00:56:56,695 --> 00:56:58,775
Did he threaten you, hurt you?
No.

880
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,815
But he knew Amira's name?

881
00:57:02,215 --> 00:57:04,215
Hm?
It seemed that way.

882
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,255
Did he say how he knew her...

883
00:57:06,895 --> 00:57:10,215
He knew her... what his plans were,
where he was heading,

884
00:57:10,255 --> 00:57:12,255
what he wants?

885
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:13,815
We just...

886
00:57:14,975 --> 00:57:16,975
He had all Dad's blood
on his jacket.

887
00:57:17,975 --> 00:57:21,175
He kept saying, 'You did this.
You did this.'

888
00:57:21,215 --> 00:57:23,215
'You, ' meaning...?

889
00:57:23,255 --> 00:57:24,655
Mira.

890
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:26,695
I could see him yelling.

891
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,735
I said to Mira,

892
00:57:28,775 --> 00:57:30,855
'What's he want,
what's he on about?'

893
00:57:30,895 --> 00:57:35,375
She was like, 'Don't talk to him,
don't look him in the eye,
he's nuts, that man.'

894
00:57:35,415 --> 00:57:36,735
Right.

895
00:57:36,775 --> 00:57:39,855
Then I woke up in that greenhouse
place with the phone.

896
00:57:39,895 --> 00:57:43,655
Well, your sister got her medicine
thanks to you.

897
00:57:44,775 --> 00:57:46,775
What about me mam?

898
00:57:46,815 --> 00:57:49,615
She'll be proud of you,
helping your sister.

899
00:57:51,015 --> 00:57:53,015
Yeah. Well, that's the main thing.

900
00:57:57,815 --> 00:57:59,815
What does that mean?

901
00:58:01,295 --> 00:58:03,295
Mira's her life.

902
00:58:03,335 --> 00:58:05,335
I don't mind, it's just how it is.

903
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:07,375
'Ee, I'm sure you both are.

904
00:58:10,175 --> 00:58:12,375
Is that what you're like
with your kids?

905
00:58:12,415 --> 00:58:14,415
I don't have kids.

906
00:58:16,175 --> 00:58:18,255
Well, when you were growing up,
then?

907
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:21,335
Well, it was er... just me
and my dad.

908
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:24,295
But he was more into his hobbies.

909
00:58:25,495 --> 00:58:27,495
Such as?

910
00:58:27,535 --> 00:58:29,535
He stuffed birds.

911
00:58:30,815 --> 00:58:32,815
Creepy.
Aye, yeah, it was.

912
00:58:35,775 --> 00:58:37,335
Well, how did you cope?

913
00:58:38,575 --> 00:58:40,575
How did I cope?

914
00:58:40,615 --> 00:58:42,615
Well, you just grow up.

915
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:47,055
I thought, 'One day, I'll wake up

916
00:58:47,095 --> 00:58:52,535
and the whole world won't revolve
around me trying to please him.'

917
00:58:53,975 --> 00:58:55,615
Yeah.

918
00:59:06,295 --> 00:59:09,655
Well, come on, young man. That's
enough social work for one evening.

919
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:16,535
Thanks for dropping him.

920
00:59:16,575 --> 00:59:18,095
On my way.

921
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,535
You and Karen been together long?

922
00:59:35,535 --> 00:59:37,295
Long enough.

923
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,615
And Mira?

924
00:59:41,455 --> 00:59:43,015
What about her?

925
00:59:43,055 --> 00:59:45,255
Do you think she'll be OK?

926
00:59:45,295 --> 00:59:47,935
I don't know.
She barely ever talks to me.

927
00:59:47,975 --> 00:59:50,895
Well, she missed a treat there, pet.
What are you doing?

928
00:59:50,935 --> 00:59:52,535
Chatting.

929
00:59:52,575 --> 00:59:54,175
Is that what you call it?

930
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:57,135
Not to you, to my mates.

931
00:59:57,175 --> 00:59:58,535
Hm.

932
01:00:02,535 --> 01:00:04,535
Be my guest!

933
01:00:09,975 --> 01:00:11,975
Hi, Margaret.

934
01:00:15,335 --> 01:00:17,135
Joe?

935
01:00:18,775 --> 01:00:20,775
What are you doing?

936
01:00:22,415 --> 01:00:24,415
So I'm sitting in this pizzeria.

937
01:00:25,975 --> 01:00:28,775
And I can't help thinking,
'What about the balloons?'

938
01:00:28,815 --> 01:00:29,975
The what, love?

939
01:00:30,895 --> 01:00:33,175
The balloons, hanging on
the front door.

940
01:00:33,935 --> 01:00:36,855
The same day that fella broke in
and shot Dr Marsden.

941
01:00:38,255 --> 01:00:40,975
Who put balloons out?
The party was two days off.

942
01:00:41,015 --> 01:00:43,015
A bit of festive cheer.

943
01:00:43,055 --> 01:00:45,055
Or maybe it was a signal.

944
01:00:46,895 --> 01:00:48,895
Maybe it was a sign.

945
01:00:48,935 --> 01:00:51,535
So that he knew exactly
which house to come to.

946
01:00:51,575 --> 01:00:53,575
Go home, Joe.

947
01:00:53,615 --> 01:00:55,615
Kiss the wife.

948
01:00:58,935 --> 01:01:00,935
What if Mira knew he was coming?

949
01:01:00,975 --> 01:01:02,975
What if she was waiting for him?

950
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:08,495
Malik dumps the sister
he doesn't need,

951
01:01:08,535 --> 01:01:11,935
risks everything to go back to
the house for Mira's insulin.

952
01:01:11,975 --> 01:01:13,975
She's what he came for.

953
01:01:14,015 --> 01:01:18,215
So if Mira and Malik planned this,
how did they communicate?

954
01:01:18,255 --> 01:01:21,375
You've checked the phone records
for the whole family.

955
01:01:21,415 --> 01:01:23,895
Of course.
There's no calls to or from Iraq.

956
01:01:23,935 --> 01:01:26,335
We'd have noticed.
Right.

957
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:28,495
And you've checked the social
network sites.

958
01:01:30,775 --> 01:01:31,855
What?

959
01:01:34,135 --> 01:01:37,055
Kelman was gonna do that.
But it wasn't top of his list.

960
01:01:37,695 --> 01:01:39,415
Look, Mira was a victim.

961
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:41,375
She wasn't part of it.

962
01:01:51,015 --> 01:01:52,055
Stop!

963
01:01:52,095 --> 01:01:53,655
Go back.

964
01:01:55,175 --> 01:01:56,815
There.

965
01:01:56,855 --> 01:01:58,335
Mira M.

966
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,775
There's Karen...

967
01:02:05,815 --> 01:02:07,575
Kyle.

968
01:02:09,975 --> 01:02:12,655
And that's him. Look, he's listed as
one of her friends.

969
01:02:13,935 --> 01:02:15,215
Baghdad.

970
01:02:15,255 --> 01:02:17,255
It's him.

971
01:02:18,295 --> 01:02:20,295
They were in contact.

972
01:02:21,495 --> 01:02:23,495
Did they talk, chat?

973
01:02:23,535 --> 01:02:25,935
You'd need a password.
We'd need a search warrant.

974
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:27,375
Get one.

975
01:02:30,335 --> 01:02:33,535
They planned it together.
Hold on, we don't know that.

976
01:03:08,808 --> 01:03:10,808
So these books you lent Mira.

977
01:03:11,848 --> 01:03:16,368
Can you remember why she was so
interested, what it was she was
looking to find out?

978
01:03:16,408 --> 01:03:17,708
I don't know.

979
01:03:17,765 --> 01:03:19,805
I've been going out my skull,
to be honest.

980
01:03:19,845 --> 01:03:23,085
Mira looking for her past.
She was what, your project?

981
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:25,125
It's not like that.
Girlfriend?

982
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:29,245
Please, I don't want it getting
about.

983
01:03:29,285 --> 01:03:32,845
Come on, lad, you fell for her.
It's not the end of the world.

984
01:03:32,885 --> 01:03:35,565
I can't have people knowing.
People?

985
01:03:35,605 --> 01:03:37,565
At the mosque?

986
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,605
My family.

987
01:03:40,565 --> 01:03:42,885
She just wanted someone
she could talk to.

988
01:03:42,925 --> 01:03:47,325
She's not a kid, she's a young
woman. She's curious about
where she comes from.

989
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:48,845
She could talk to her parents.

990
01:03:48,885 --> 01:03:52,405
Maybe she didn't feel comfortable
asking her parents the questions.

991
01:03:53,725 --> 01:03:57,365
She didn't want to upset anyone,
particularly her mum.

992
01:03:58,165 --> 01:04:00,165
Well, what sort of questions?

993
01:04:09,085 --> 01:04:10,725
She wanted me to keep them safe.

994
01:04:13,365 --> 01:04:15,845
Was this her old family?
Aye.

995
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,885
Laura said she had some photos.

996
01:04:18,565 --> 01:04:21,125
She must have taken these
from the trunk in the house.

997
01:04:21,165 --> 01:04:23,165
From the back of the shed, she said.

998
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:29,525
Is this the old family?

999
01:04:30,565 --> 01:04:31,685
Aye.

1000
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:37,685
This is her brother?

1001
01:04:37,725 --> 01:04:39,725
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

1002
01:04:44,045 --> 01:04:45,245
It's him.

1003
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:47,125
The same fella.

1004
01:04:47,165 --> 01:04:48,845
Eh?

1005
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:52,925
No, he died.
They all died in some bomb.

1006
01:04:52,965 --> 01:04:55,285
They've been in contact
on a social network site.

1007
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:56,565
No.

1008
01:04:56,605 --> 01:04:58,605
Don't you lie to me.
I'm not.

1009
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,645
She'd have told me.

1010
01:05:03,565 --> 01:05:05,565
She'd have told me.

1011
01:05:06,925 --> 01:05:09,605
Brother and sister.
He came for her.

1012
01:05:09,645 --> 01:05:11,645
Get Kenny on to the Foreign Office.

1013
01:05:11,685 --> 01:05:15,725
Anything on file, anything they can
dredge up on Malik Saleh.

1014
01:05:15,765 --> 01:05:17,765
We can't just stick around.

1015
01:05:17,805 --> 01:05:22,845
They must know as long as he's here,
we're gonna come looking for them.
So how do they get out?

1016
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:36,525
My client wants to help
with your investigation.

1017
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:40,365
But asks that this be taken into
account in the event of his own
trial.

1018
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:42,885
This man.

1019
01:05:42,925 --> 01:05:46,805
Have you any idea how he's planning
to get out of the country, Mr Webb?

1020
01:05:51,165 --> 01:05:52,805
Mr Webb?

1021
01:05:52,845 --> 01:05:54,845
Anything you've seen or heard?

1022
01:06:02,205 --> 01:06:05,125
Only if you swear to protect
my family.

1023
01:06:09,445 --> 01:06:11,005
Swear it.

1024
01:06:18,525 --> 01:06:20,485
Kenny, we've got him.
Great.

1025
01:06:20,525 --> 01:06:24,045
The last time the Albanians spoke to
Gary Webb it was to offer him a job.

1026
01:06:24,085 --> 01:06:26,365
He had to be at the docks Thursday,
today.

1027
01:06:26,405 --> 01:06:29,085
The second shift and wait for
orders. So what?

1028
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:32,805
I spoke to the harbour master.
There aren't any boats due in
second shift today.

1029
01:06:32,845 --> 01:06:34,645
But there is one boat leaving.

1030
01:06:34,685 --> 01:06:38,285
Tramp ship, bound for Hamburg,
leaves the south quay six o'clock
tonight.

1031
01:06:38,325 --> 01:06:41,325
So what if he's smuggling people
out of the country and not in?

1032
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:43,445
Malik.

1033
01:06:43,485 --> 01:06:46,765
We seize the boat,
sit tight and we wait.

1034
01:06:48,085 --> 01:06:51,685
Joe, is there anything from the tech
team on the social network?

1035
01:06:51,725 --> 01:06:53,725
Mira and Saleh exchanged messages.

1036
01:06:53,765 --> 01:06:56,565
They were deleted at least a week
ago. Can we get 'em back?

1037
01:06:56,605 --> 01:07:00,325
It'll be tough but they're on it.
They were covering their tracks.

1038
01:07:00,365 --> 01:07:02,365
Thank you.
Let's go.

1039
01:07:03,005 --> 01:07:04,965
Oh, ma'am.

1040
01:07:05,005 --> 01:07:07,005
From the Foreign Office.

1041
01:07:07,045 --> 01:07:09,045
Thanks, I'll read it
on the way over.

1042
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:16,765
Yeah?

1043
01:07:18,565 --> 01:07:19,645
OK, cheers.

1044
01:07:21,885 --> 01:07:23,885
The hospital. Laura's awake.

1045
01:07:26,845 --> 01:07:29,325
What are we gonna tell her?
Her own daughter?

1046
01:07:41,085 --> 01:07:42,285
Mum?

1047
01:07:44,525 --> 01:07:46,525
Mira, where is she?

1048
01:07:47,445 --> 01:07:49,445
She's going to be fine.

1049
01:07:49,485 --> 01:07:51,685
Everybody's talking in riddles
today.

1050
01:07:52,165 --> 01:07:54,685
Somebody, please tell me
where my daughter is.

1051
01:07:55,685 --> 01:07:57,685
She's right here, Mum.

1052
01:07:58,885 --> 01:08:00,485
Karen, I didn't...

1053
01:08:00,525 --> 01:08:03,125
Call her back, I didn't mean
to sound like that.

1054
01:08:04,445 --> 01:08:06,805
Mr Creavey, take care of her, love.

1055
01:08:06,845 --> 01:08:08,205
Sure.

1056
01:08:09,365 --> 01:08:11,525
Here if you need me.

1057
01:08:11,565 --> 01:08:13,565
It's OK.

1058
01:08:14,805 --> 01:08:16,805
You remember Joe?

1059
01:08:16,845 --> 01:08:18,845
Meet the man who saved your life.

1060
01:08:23,285 --> 01:08:26,005
Now, Laura,
the man who broke into your house...

1061
01:08:26,645 --> 01:08:29,165
Who shot me.
..he came for Mira's insulin.

1062
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:31,165
Yes.

1063
01:08:33,005 --> 01:08:35,005
I told him where it was.

1064
01:08:35,045 --> 01:08:36,805
Then he spoke to you?

1065
01:08:38,925 --> 01:08:40,925
It could make all the difference.

1066
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:45,525
He looked me in the eyes, said,
'I didn't mean to hurt anybody.'

1067
01:08:45,565 --> 01:08:47,565
So says the man with a gun.

1068
01:08:47,605 --> 01:08:49,605
He came up with some...

1069
01:08:51,165 --> 01:08:54,765
cock and bull, I couldn't make
head or tail of it, to be honest.

1070
01:08:54,805 --> 01:08:58,485
Said he was Mira's brother.
They're all dead. We all know that.

1071
01:08:59,165 --> 01:09:04,965
Laura, I have here visa applications
and various petitions to the British
Embassy in Baghdad,

1072
01:09:05,005 --> 01:09:07,365
all written by the man who shot you,

1073
01:09:07,405 --> 01:09:10,245
and who's now holding
your eldest daughter.

1074
01:09:13,845 --> 01:09:15,845
I can't focus. You read them.

1075
01:09:21,045 --> 01:09:23,045
August 2002.

1076
01:09:23,085 --> 01:09:25,085
'My name is Malik Saleh.

1077
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:27,125
I am the eldest of seven children.'

1078
01:09:27,165 --> 01:09:28,845
Then there's a whole list of them.

1079
01:09:29,805 --> 01:09:31,805
'The youngest is Amira,

1080
01:09:31,845 --> 01:09:34,125
whom my father would call
his dear heart,

1081
01:09:34,165 --> 01:09:36,405
his palash' whatever that is.

1082
01:09:36,445 --> 01:09:38,445
It's a kind of blossom.

1083
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:39,725
OK.

1084
01:09:40,485 --> 01:09:42,485
'After my father died,

1085
01:09:42,525 --> 01:09:45,845
I raised my brothers and sisters
as my own children.'

1086
01:09:50,925 --> 01:09:52,925
You need to go to hospital.

1087
01:09:52,965 --> 01:09:55,285
Hang on. Let me just call you
an ambulance.

1088
01:09:57,165 --> 01:09:58,245
No!

1089
01:09:58,285 --> 01:09:59,565
Please.

1090
01:09:59,605 --> 01:10:02,565
August 21st, 2002.

1091
01:10:03,325 --> 01:10:05,925
'An American cruise missile fell on
our house.

1092
01:10:07,565 --> 01:10:13,565
Fortunately, Mira was found and taken
to England where she was given every
attention.

1093
01:10:14,365 --> 01:10:18,685
Days later, I was found by looters
in the rubble.

1094
01:10:18,725 --> 01:10:21,245
A local doctor worked,
without anaesthetic,

1095
01:10:21,285 --> 01:10:23,285
to repair my injuries.'

1096
01:10:34,325 --> 01:10:42,285
'I swear this is the truth, I enclose
sworn affidavits as a list of people
confirming the same.

1097
01:10:43,525 --> 01:10:45,845
I only want to be reunited
with my sister.'

1098
01:10:52,645 --> 01:10:54,645
Wait, wait.

1099
01:10:56,965 --> 01:10:58,365
Here.

1100
01:11:03,845 --> 01:11:05,365
Thank you.

1101
01:11:08,525 --> 01:11:12,365
And there's eight more of these,
all along the same lines.

1102
01:11:13,405 --> 01:11:15,405
What did they do at the embassy?

1103
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:19,205
All applications denied.
Kept on file.

1104
01:11:21,045 --> 01:11:23,045
Well, there was a war on.

1105
01:11:23,085 --> 01:11:26,005
A case like this,
bound to be swept under the carpet.

1106
01:11:27,445 --> 01:11:29,445
Can I have a look, please?

1107
01:11:44,485 --> 01:11:46,005
Oh, no.

1108
01:12:14,405 --> 01:12:16,405
Civil servant, Foreign Office.

1109
01:12:16,445 --> 01:12:18,445
You were in Baghdad.

1110
01:12:18,485 --> 01:12:19,805
Right.

1111
01:12:19,845 --> 01:12:23,005
First Secretary, 2002-7.
Rough old time.

1112
01:12:23,045 --> 01:12:27,045
You signed every one of these.
Jeremy Robin Creavey.

1113
01:12:27,925 --> 01:12:29,685
They crossed my desk.

1114
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:33,085
Even after you left Baghdad,
you made sure you got hold of them.

1115
01:12:34,045 --> 01:12:36,045
You locked that man out.

1116
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:38,725
From what? His right?

1117
01:12:38,765 --> 01:12:40,765
His sister.

1118
01:12:40,805 --> 01:12:44,485
Dan... he was my best friend.

1119
01:12:45,845 --> 01:12:48,045
The thought of him losing his child.
You know?

1120
01:12:48,085 --> 01:12:50,085
And I could help.

1121
01:12:51,245 --> 01:12:53,965
What good would come
of dragging her back there?

1122
01:12:54,005 --> 01:12:56,125
I mean, fractured spine, diabetes...

1123
01:12:56,165 --> 01:12:58,765
that's nothing to the nightmares
every night.

1124
01:12:59,925 --> 01:13:01,925
My God, I heard her once...

1125
01:13:01,965 --> 01:13:03,605
screaming.

1126
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:07,125
She fell down the stairs.

1127
01:13:09,045 --> 01:13:11,405
Her mother scooped her up and...

1128
01:13:14,645 --> 01:13:17,605
For the record, I'd do the same
thing again.

1129
01:13:20,845 --> 01:13:23,645
Did Laura have any inkling
about you, this?

1130
01:13:23,685 --> 01:13:24,885
No.

1131
01:13:25,645 --> 01:13:27,645
Dan said, 'Keep her out of it.'

1132
01:13:40,325 --> 01:13:42,605
The skipper says we're wasting
our time.

1133
01:13:42,645 --> 01:13:45,845
The plan, as was,
was to pick Malik up out at sea.

1134
01:13:47,045 --> 01:13:49,845
After they'd got shot of the harbour
pilot. We believe that?

1135
01:13:49,885 --> 01:13:54,005
With Webb in custody, they'd have
a hard time smuggling him out
the docks.

1136
01:13:54,045 --> 01:13:55,965
They'll need a boat, won't they?

1137
01:13:56,005 --> 01:13:58,805
If they're heading out to sea,
they're gonna need a boat.

1138
01:14:15,965 --> 01:14:17,165
Please.

1139
01:14:20,565 --> 01:14:23,285
Brother and sister.

1140
01:14:37,485 --> 01:14:40,405
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1141
01:14:42,045 --> 01:14:43,525
You said to come.

1142
01:14:46,005 --> 01:14:47,325
You asked me...

1143
01:14:48,645 --> 01:14:50,645
to come.

1144
01:14:54,445 --> 01:14:56,445
I came all this way.

1145
01:15:01,245 --> 01:15:03,245
And you just screamed.

1146
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:09,285
I came all this way
and you screamed.

1147
01:15:27,373 --> 01:15:29,373
Romeo 430.

1148
01:15:30,413 --> 01:15:31,413
Come.

1149
01:15:33,573 --> 01:15:34,933
Come.

1150
01:16:25,094 --> 01:16:27,054
Hey. Come on, get up.

1151
01:16:27,094 --> 01:16:28,614
Come on.

1152
01:16:40,614 --> 01:16:42,014
Let's go.

1153
01:17:16,174 --> 01:17:18,174
Forgive me.

1154
01:17:22,014 --> 01:17:24,014
I never wished to hurt.

1155
01:17:28,054 --> 01:17:30,574
Our father, he made me... swear...

1156
01:17:30,614 --> 01:17:32,614
I know.

1157
01:17:34,534 --> 01:17:36,534
To protect you...

1158
01:17:39,974 --> 01:17:41,974
when he's gone.

1159
01:17:44,494 --> 01:17:46,494
What was he like?

1160
01:17:48,174 --> 01:17:50,174
Always in his house.

1161
01:17:55,294 --> 01:17:57,294
Always for his people.

1162
01:18:03,294 --> 01:18:04,494
Go.

1163
01:18:11,134 --> 01:18:13,134
Where are we?

1164
01:18:15,694 --> 01:18:17,014
Home.

1165
01:18:17,054 --> 01:18:19,054
We're going home.

1166
01:18:32,214 --> 01:18:34,214
Armed police!

1167
01:19:54,694 --> 01:19:56,214
Sorry.

1168
01:20:03,254 --> 01:20:05,254
Take a look.

1169
01:20:07,014 --> 01:20:09,014
I like Mira in this photo.
Don't you?

1170
01:20:10,574 --> 01:20:12,374
It's all right.

1171
01:20:13,174 --> 01:20:15,174
Not sure your sister would agree.

1172
01:20:16,374 --> 01:20:18,374
Your mam said, the fringe thingy.

1173
01:20:19,134 --> 01:20:21,134
A bit of a flashpoint, apparently.

1174
01:20:21,174 --> 01:20:23,174
Did you know that?

1175
01:20:23,214 --> 01:20:24,774
No.

1176
01:20:29,534 --> 01:20:32,694
So if Mira doesn't like
this photo...

1177
01:20:33,814 --> 01:20:35,814
what's it doing on her profile?

1178
01:20:37,814 --> 01:20:39,814
Unless Mira didn't set this up.

1179
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,254
Unless someone else set it up...

1180
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:47,974
pretending to be Mira.

1181
01:20:54,574 --> 01:20:56,574
You want to be like her, is that it?

1182
01:20:58,374 --> 01:20:59,894
No.

1183
01:21:03,974 --> 01:21:06,374
It was the way he looked at her
this one time.

1184
01:21:07,454 --> 01:21:09,454
I just thought, 'Here we go again.'

1185
01:21:09,494 --> 01:21:11,494
He? Who's he?

1186
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:13,534
Kyle.
Ah, your boyfriend?

1187
01:21:14,174 --> 01:21:15,414
Oh.

1188
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:17,454
A bit too fond of Mira, was he?

1189
01:21:17,494 --> 01:21:19,414
Yeah.

1190
01:21:21,614 --> 01:21:26,494
So what? You thought, 'I know,
I'll set up a profile, I'll pretend
to be my sis,

1191
01:21:26,534 --> 01:21:28,534
see what he's up to'?

1192
01:21:28,574 --> 01:21:30,094
Yeah.

1193
01:21:30,134 --> 01:21:32,934
So you and Kyle became, what is it?

1194
01:21:32,974 --> 01:21:34,534
Online buddies.

1195
01:21:34,574 --> 01:21:36,894
Yeah, buddies,
you pretending to be Mira.

1196
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,374
And?

1197
01:21:41,494 --> 01:21:44,814
Straightaway, he was, like,
'Oh, you're dead mysterious.

1198
01:21:45,854 --> 01:21:48,174
Maybe I picked the wrong sister.'

1199
01:21:49,134 --> 01:21:51,134
What did Karen think about that?

1200
01:21:52,014 --> 01:21:54,014
I'm used to it.

1201
01:21:54,854 --> 01:21:59,654
People... ever since I can remember,
just crawling over me to get
to Mira.

1202
01:21:59,694 --> 01:22:01,294
You know.

1203
01:22:01,334 --> 01:22:04,694
It's that way she has, so it's all,
like, totally blameless.

1204
01:22:05,454 --> 01:22:08,774
I know she's been bad with him,
going missing after school.

1205
01:22:08,814 --> 01:22:11,094
No, it wasn't Kyle she was with,
love.

1206
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:13,134
It was another lad.
What?

1207
01:22:14,254 --> 01:22:16,254
No, you're wrong.
Trust me.

1208
01:22:18,054 --> 01:22:23,014
So, go on. One day, Mira gets this
new friend request, does she?

1209
01:22:23,054 --> 01:22:24,654
From Malik?

1210
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:27,974
Yeah.

1211
01:22:29,734 --> 01:22:32,374
You asked him to come, didn't you?

1212
01:22:36,654 --> 01:22:38,374
I just thought...

1213
01:22:38,414 --> 01:22:41,894
'Let someone else love her for
a change if she's so loveable.'

1214
01:22:42,814 --> 01:22:46,614
I didn't think he'd show up. You set
out balloons so he'd know the house.

1215
01:22:46,654 --> 01:22:48,654
I didn't mean it.

1216
01:22:48,694 --> 01:22:50,694
He came all that way.

1217
01:22:51,654 --> 01:22:55,334
He expected her to be waiting,
a big smile and her bags all packed.

1218
01:22:55,374 --> 01:22:57,094
I know.

1219
01:22:58,134 --> 01:23:00,134
It was just...

1220
01:23:02,014 --> 01:23:04,054
It was just what, love?

1221
01:23:04,094 --> 01:23:06,094
It was just a game.

1222
01:23:25,014 --> 01:23:27,014
I think you're wrong.

1223
01:23:27,054 --> 01:23:29,374
Your sister, she was never
the favourite.

1224
01:23:29,414 --> 01:23:31,734
She just needed
that little bit more help.

1225
01:23:32,414 --> 01:23:34,494
Funny, that's what
my dad used to say.

1226
01:23:34,534 --> 01:23:37,094
Well, go on, then.
What do I tell them?

1227
01:23:37,134 --> 01:23:39,134
The truth.

1228
01:23:39,854 --> 01:23:42,574
While you still can.
It's better coming from you.

1229
01:23:42,614 --> 01:23:44,254
Go on.

1230
01:23:44,694 --> 01:23:46,254
Go on.

1231
01:23:49,094 --> 01:23:50,454
Mum?

1232
01:23:52,054 --> 01:23:53,094
Hey.

1233
01:23:53,134 --> 01:23:55,134
Oh, Karen, come here.

1234
01:24:00,654 --> 01:24:03,014
You all right?
Yeah.

1235
01:24:15,054 --> 01:24:16,614
Cara.

1236
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:23,454
Oh, that politely bewildered look of
yours. Don't know what I'd do
without it.

1237
01:24:25,294 --> 01:24:27,294
Who or what is Cara?

1238
01:24:28,134 --> 01:24:30,334
My sister, long-lost since you asked.

1239
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:35,134
Well, that means that...

1240
01:24:35,174 --> 01:24:37,174
I know what it means.

1241
01:24:38,174 --> 01:24:40,374
Are you gonna track her down, then,
or what?

1242
01:24:40,414 --> 01:24:41,934
I don't know.

1243
01:24:41,974 --> 01:24:43,974
I don't know what I'd get out of it.

1244
01:24:44,014 --> 01:24:47,174
How many times are we gonna have
this conversation over and over

1245
01:24:47,214 --> 01:24:49,414
until you finally pluck up
the courage?

1246
01:24:49,454 --> 01:24:50,854
No, no.

1247
01:24:50,894 --> 01:24:52,854
It's just...

1248
01:24:52,894 --> 01:24:54,894
Well, there's family, right?

1249
01:24:56,014 --> 01:24:59,414
And then there's people
you get to know.

1250
01:24:59,454 --> 01:25:02,854
And people around you,
people you can trust.

1251
01:25:04,454 --> 01:25:07,374
And maybe that's enough,
maybe that's all you need.

1252
01:25:08,214 --> 01:25:09,694
Aye, of course.

1253
01:25:09,734 --> 01:25:12,294
Hello, what's this, a deposition?

1254
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:16,974
Well, I thought maybe I'd take
that leave now, if it's all right.

1255
01:25:17,014 --> 01:25:19,014
Yeah, of course, that's a good idea.

1256
01:25:19,654 --> 01:25:21,294
You and the family.

1257
01:25:21,334 --> 01:25:23,334
You all set?
Hello, love.

1258
01:25:23,374 --> 01:25:25,334
Do you want to come back for a bite?

1259
01:25:25,374 --> 01:25:27,374
Oh, paella.

1260
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:29,414
Oh, that's tempting.

1261
01:25:30,214 --> 01:25:32,414
No, I'm a bit done in, to be honest,
love.

1262
01:25:33,534 --> 01:25:35,534
Hello.

1263
01:25:35,574 --> 01:25:37,574
Well, if you're sure.

1264
01:25:37,614 --> 01:25:39,614
Come on. Come on, you two.

1265
01:25:39,654 --> 01:25:41,254
Come here.

1266
01:26:33,573 --> 01:26:53,142

THE BRIDGE IV

4
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,910
Oh, for fuck's sake.

5
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,740
- Did someone really stone her?
- It looks like it.

6
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,790
According to the EMTs, she was hit
a hundred times before she died.

7
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:50,270
The cameras don't record automatically.
And the guards said no one drove here.

8
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,970
We found this.

9
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,370
- Oh, come on, man.
- Let me see.

10
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,930
Margrethe Thormod.
Director of the Immigration Service.

11
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,210
Okay...

12
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,790
Look. The Champagne Scandal.
According to security -

13
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,330
there was a marked increase
in threats against Thormod after this.

14
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,200
- Is she there celebrating too?
- No, but she was their boss.

15
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,930
- I don't get why this bothers people.
- They're celebrating a deportation.

16
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:39,900
It's the end of a bureaucratic process.
We have a beer after a case is closed too.

17
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,380
It's not the same.

18
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,270
- Where's that gay Iranian they deported?
- Taariq Shirazi. He went underground.

19
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,890
- Do they execute gays in Iran?
- Shirazi said he was sentenced to death.

20
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,430
Are they stoned?
If that's what awaited him, then...

21
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,750
There's a warrant for Shirazi.
Talk to the husband, Niels Thormod.

22
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,980
OK.

23
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,720
I'm just going to drain the snake.

24
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,590
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

25
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:19,910
- How's Saga doing?
- Not so good. Not good at all, actually.

26
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,550
There's two new ones coming today.
From Hinseberg.

27
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,600
I don't know their names.

28
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:49,000
Did I tell you it's Cecilia's birthday?
Six. I sent her a story.

29
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,370
I read it so she can hear my voice.
She probably doesn't recognize it.

30
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,620
She was only with me for two years.
But one day I'll read to her every night.

31
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,670
Know what story I chose?
Can I share it? Okay, I'll share it.

32
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,480
- Want to play?
- No.

33
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,200
- You never want to play!
- No. So why do you keep asking?

34
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,920
One of the new ones is staring at you.
Do you know who she is?

35
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:04,360
Yes. Lucinda Ardic. Convicted for three
murders and an attempt on two policemen.

36
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,990
- Did you put her in here?
- No, that was in Stockholm.

37
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,920
- Then why is she staring at you?
- She hates police.

38
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,190
Good thing you're not police
anymore, then.

39
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,510
Hi. Henrik Sabroe and Jonas Mandrup,
Copenhagen Police. What happened here?

40
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,330
It's Niels. He collapsed.
I work for him. I'm his assistant.

41
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,910
He had some sort of attack. Shock, maybe.
They were married 30 years.

42
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,420
- How long have you worked for him?
- A little over three years.

43
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,190
- When did Margrethe leave yesterday?
- She left the day before yesterday.

44
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,890
- Where was she going?
- They have a cottage in Norway.

45
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,910
She needed a time out
after what happened at work.

46
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,550
- When did you last hear from her?
- I don't think Niels talked to her.

47
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,320
- Why not?
- She turned off her phone.

48
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:25,320
She said she'd call if anything came up.
Sorry, but I have to go to the hospital.

49
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,230
- Think the suspect grabbed her in Norway?
- Not likely.

50
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,950
So it's 48 hours later.
This'll be a tough one for Lillian.

51
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,780
- Can we get some comments?
- Were the relatives informed?

52
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,010
- Where's Jonas?
- Forensics.

53
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:12,470
The press knows the victim was Thormod.
Who was there besides Jonas?

54
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,230
- You think it was him?
- Forget it. The press is going crazy.

55
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,870
- They're wondering if it's terrorism.
- Because of a weak link to a muslim?

56
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:30,240
According to Amnesty, stoning is used
in Iran and five other countries.

57
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,790
- Muslim countries?
- Yeah.

58
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,450
- We don't even know who did it.
- That's what I told them.

59
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,240
We're keeping the Military Police updated,
but the investigation is ours.

60
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,750
The Immigration Service got this
last Friday, after the Champagne Scandal.

61
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,750
Red October?
Sounds like the far left.

62
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,870
They've made serious threats
here and in Sweden.

63
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,960
"To send people to certain death
is undignified for a civilized country."

64
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,760
- Written in our dear neighbor's language?
- Linn knows you're coming.

65
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,640
- Do you visit Saga?
- A couple times a month.

66
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:45,560
- She doesn't always want to see me. You?
- No. It hasn't worked out.

67
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,440
This is the little we have
on Red October.

68
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:59,950
- Saga's verdict is in two days.
- I'm keeping my expectations low.

69
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,580
The new evidence was enough for HD
to allow a review. "Reasonable doubt".

70
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,900
- Do you think they'll free her?
- I'm hoping.

71
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:15,970
That's good that you're hoping.
I hope we won't be disappointed.

72
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,580
Richard Dahlqvist is here.

73
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,130
So you're an expert?

74
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:29,560
No. I specialize in groups
on the radical left.

75
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,390
- Red October, too?
- I don't know much about them.

76
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,660
Why not?

77
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:42,010
In the two years they've been active,
they've only communicated online.

78
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:49,170
- No films, speakers, or manifestos.
- Could it be one perpetrator?

79
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,830
It could, but their actions
suggest a group. Why?

80
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,040
They're part of a murder case.

81
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:02,570
- They'd never hurt or kill anyone.
- There's a first time for everything.

82
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,880
Who's the victim?

83
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,880
Margrethe Thormod,
Danish Immigration Service.

84
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,020
Your immigration policy
has provoked a lot of people.

85
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,300
- So could they have gone a step further?
- Sure, but it's unlikely.

86
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,230
- But you didn't know much, you said.
- Yeah, that's true.

87
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:36,050
If they did it, they'll keep doing it.
Won't they?

88
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,860
A cop in prison.
Because you killed your mother.

89
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,200
Because I was convicted of
killing my mother.

90
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,660
- But you didn't do it?
- No.

91
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,040
Saga! You have a visitor.

92
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,040
Ardic, stop it!

93
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,080
Everyone chooses a leisure activity.
Pottery doesn't involve other people.

94
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,910
Has anything happened
since last time?

95
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,320
A new inmate came today
from Hinseberg. Lucinda Ardic.

96
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,190
- Is that good or bad?
- Everything is bad. It just gets worse.

97
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,390
Focus on your reading
and on your routine.

98
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:34,070
It's not MY routine.
Someone else decides what I should do.

99
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,030
There's only two days left.

100
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:43,270
Even with the new evidence, there are
fewer acquittals than convictions.

101
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:49,080
- Only this much doubt is needed.
- Otherwise I'll spend eight years here.

102
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:06,160
I have a new case. The Director of the
Immigration Service was stoned to death.

103
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:12,400
Everything to do with immigrants is
usually grotesquely huge, so I...

104
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,010
- ...I could use some help.
- I'm not police anymore.

105
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,550
No, I know that.
But you're still the best.

106
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,690
I'm not police anymore!

107
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,230
Are you coming?

108
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,590
Yeah.

109
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,600
Yeah.

110
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,910
[Reported missing]

111
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,350
Get out. That's mine.
Get out!

112
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,870
No, stop!

113
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,550
Stop it and get out. Out!

114
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,670
Back off! Now!

115
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,960
Come here.

116
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:07,420
- Sorry. You're that journalist, right?
- Is it good to be that journalist?

117
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:13,030
- Could be. You're hotter in real life.
- Yeah, I've heard that.

118
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,150
- Robin.
- Richard.

119
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,430
- Can I take a picture of us?
- Sure.

120
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,110
Thanks.

121
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,840
- You drinking?
- You offering?

122
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,640
- Uh-huh.
- In that case, I'm drinking.

123
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:11,260
The murder of Margrethe Thormod
has received widespread attention.

124
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,900
She had been threatened...

125
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,460
Good morning.

126
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,900
- ...by the group Red October.
- What service!

127
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,710
Here you are.
Here you are.

128
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,150
- It's taped. I did it yesterday.
- It says "direct".

129
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,580
Yes, but you know tv.
They cheat.

130
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,820
Okay, it's not me.
It's my twin brother.

131
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,070
- I'm Patrick.
- Fuck!

132
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,940
I'm no worse in bed.
To the contrary, actually.

133
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,630
If that's all you wanted,
then you chose the right brother.

134
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,730
Dammit!

135
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,520
- Hey. How's it going?
- Good. And you?

136
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,360
Good, thanks. Really good.

137
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,580
- And the drugs? Any relapse?
- What do you know about that?

138
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:16,510
- I know everything I want to know.
- Okay. It's fine. No relapses.

139
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:22,010
- What about the girlfriend?
- I doubt she wants to be called that.

140
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,080
- Then it's good she can't hear me.
- The verdict is being delivered tomorrow.

141
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,030
Good luck. The visitation room
doesn't have great ambiance.

142
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,300
What do you know about
the visitation room?

143
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,800
Yeah. You want to know about the phone?

144
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,730
Margrethe ordered a taxi
at 9:30AM via an app.

145
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:50,030
9:30? The Oslo flight was 4 hours later,
and it's half an hour to Kastrup, max.

146
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:56,860
She got a call from an unknown number
at 10:39. Length: 58 seconds.

147
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,170
- Can you trace it?
- No. Prepaid.

148
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,670
The phone is off.
But I'll see it if it turns on.

149
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:11,720
Here are the numbers not in her contacts.
Here's her browser history...

150
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,890
- And the taxi company she used.
- Thanks.

151
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,550
...and when I dropped that idiot off,
he left his phone.

152
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,030
- Dan Brolund?
- Yeah?

153
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,700
- It was 9:30AM?
- Yeah. On the 28th.

154
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:41,820
Margrethe Thormod. I dropped her off
at Carsten Niebuhrs Gade at 9:55.

155
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,190
Oh, right. She was going to be picked up
an hour later, but she never showed.

156
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:55,050
- What's at that address?
- Hotel Dronningen.

157
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,730
- Did she have a quickie before her trip?
- Why do you think that?

158
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,130
- An hour in a hotel at 10AM?
- She could've had a meeting.

159
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,990
There was nothing in her calendar.
Maybe cheating is punished by stoning.

160
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,580
What's that?

161
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,070
- The taxi driver?
- Yeah.

162
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:35,070
I drove her to the hotel, and
she asked me to get her at 11.

163
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,490
- But she never showed.
- You don't say.

164
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:45,730
- What did you do while you waited?
- Got a cup of coffee with a coworker.

165
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:50,100
- We need their name.
- Of course.

166
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:57,500
So you drive back to the hotel,
you wait, and she doesn't show up?

167
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:03,410
- You didn't have other fares that day?
- No. It would've been the last.

168
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,380
- At 11AM?
- Yeah, I started at midnight, so...

169
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:15,870
- What did you do after?
- Worked out with some friends.

170
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,090
You can check it out.

171
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:27,060
It's not the first time you've been here.
Possession of firearms, narcotics...

172
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:33,240
Violence. Threats. Attempted murder.
Against women. Margrethe was a woman.

173
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:39,460
- You were the last to see her alive.
- Yes, but I explained that.

174
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,140
So just check my alibi.

175
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:53,700
- There was an incident in your cell.
- Yes.

176
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,140
- You assaulted one of the inmates.
- Yes.

177
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,340
- Why didn't you call the guards?
- I wanted to hurt her.

178
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,900
- I need to take disciplinary measures.
- I understand. You don't have to explain.

179
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,830
You'll have 24 hours in solitary.

180
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,850
- The taxi driver?
- If his alibi cracks, we have a suspect.

181
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,710
- And if it holds up?
- In that case...

182
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,500
...he dropped Thormod off
at the hotel at 9:55AM.

183
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:13,870
She got a call 45 minutes later.
Unknown number.

184
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:19,590
- She didn't show up for the taxi at 11.
- And we don't know who called.

185
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,920
The phone can't be traced when it's off.

186
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,670
We need to talk to the husband.
Her calendar had no meetings.

187
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,410
- What about the hotel?
- No one saw her.

188
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:36,070
Prince Charming's alibi checks out.
The waiter at the café remembers him.

189
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:41,740
- He stays until we check the car.
- We need to let him go. Anything more?

190
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:48,680
Cause of death was trauma to the head
and torso. 75 to 90 hits before she died.

191
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,030
How can someone do that?

192
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,710
- Did we find the gay guy?
- Taariq Shirazi. Learn it.

193
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:03,870
- You still get it. Did we find the queer?
- No, we don't know where Taariq is.

194
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:08,970
- Red October, then?
- The expert didn't have anything.

195
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:14,310
Fires, explosions, hacked websites.
The MPs know as much as we do.

196
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,550
Nothing, then.

197
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,180
- Hello?
- Hey.

198
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:32,860
I was tagged in a photo on Insta.
I was with a certain Robin.

199
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,450
- Stop pretending you're me.
- I just don't correct them.

200
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:41,270
From now on.
Use a glass.

201
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,820
You know Red October? They texted,
wanting to meet. How huge is that?

202
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,100
- You're coming.
- To do what?

203
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,860
- Sit in the car, keep watch, follow.
- Follow where?

204
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,380
I don't know. They've never contacted
anyone before. I'm the first.

205
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,110
Your wife never checked into her flight
to Oslo. She left at 9:30AM.

206
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,110
- And the flight was at 2PM.
- Exactly.

207
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:23,410
However, she went to Hotel Dronningen.
Do you know why?

208
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,230
- No.
- Did she mention a meeting there?

209
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,850
No. She didn't say anything.

210
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,990
- Did she usually have secret meetings?
- What kind of fucking question is that?

211
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,480
- You mean was she cheating?
- Was she?

212
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,630
No, she wasn't.

213
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:53,470
We know about the threats at work.
Did she get threats at home, too?

214
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:59,850
- Lots. Do you know why?
- The Champagne Scandal, yeah.

215
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:05,310
She didn't know they were celebrating.
It was some administrators.

216
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:11,310
She distanced herself completely from it.
Is it true...

217
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:19,110
- Is it true she was stoned?
- Yes, unfortunately. We're sorry.

218
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,590
If she has a computer at home,
we need access to it.

219
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,030
Susanne has keys.

220
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:35,830
- So you heard nothing after she left?
- No.

221
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,240
- For two days?
- No.

222
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,300
She didn't call to say she was there?
That everything was fine?

223
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:52,130
- Isn't that strange?
- She needed to get away. From everything.

224
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:02,540
- They're fucking, crybaby and her.
- So now he's cheating too?

225
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:10,260
- Wife's away, the Asian has keys.
- Do your secret lovers have keys?

226
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,780
No. I don't operate like that.
I don't shit where I eat.

227
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,910
- You're some kind of poet, Jonas.
- I know. But thank you.

228
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,330
Hello?

229
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,440
- Hey, it's me.
- What's wrong?

230
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:36,020
A photo of me from field day was
on the website, but it's gone now.

231
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,700
- How long was it there?
- I don't know. A few hours.

232
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,860
Should I go to the movies
or come home directly?

233
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,220
No, go to the movies.
I'll see you at home later.

234
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:52,380
- It's okay. No risk.
- Okay. See you tonight, then.

235
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,950
See ya. Kisses.

236
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,140
What was that?

237
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:03,900
Christoffer. There was a photo of him
on the school's website.

238
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,790
That's fucking inexcusable.

239
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:11,940
- Imagine if he saw it.
- How long was it up?

240
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,220
- A couple hours.
- Then it's unlikely.

241
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:22,270
- You can call me whenever.
- Thanks.

242
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,340
Okay?

243
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,380
- Shall we get back to it?
- Yeah.

244
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,630
Shh! Shut up, for fuck's sake!

245
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,520
I'm so glad I finally found you.

246
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,260
- Yeah?
- How long are we going to wait?

247
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:30,780
- A little longer. Don't call again.
- No, no.

248
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:52,150
I know I've made mistakes, Sofie.

249
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,840
But you have, too. No?

250
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,110
Yeah.

251
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:22,790
Remember what we said about divorced
couples that only meet for the kids?

252
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:27,790
Remember what we talked about?
A child needs both parents.

253
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,750
- I haven't seen Christoffer for a year.
- He doesn't want to.

254
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,630
- Whose fault is that?
- He'll be 17 soon.

255
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:43,110
He's a child, Sofie!
So who made him not want to see me?

256
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,760
- I did.
- You did, yeah.

257
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,950
I'm sorry.

258
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:58,650
The police wanted to talk about a fare
today. It should've taken five minutes.

259
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:03,910
Then they found your charges
and they took me in.

260
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:11,990
I sat there half the day. Half the day
because of your charges!

261
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,870
Now they took the car, so I can't
make money. Is that what you wanted?

262
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:23,810
Of course you should make money, Dan.
I'm sorry.

263
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,520
It's okay.

264
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:35,310
That's how it is. The important thing
is that you learn from your mistakes.

265
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,650
I've missed you so much, Sofie.

266
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,310
Hello?

267
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,310
Hey...

268
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,630
Get out.

269
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:11,990
- Put the knife away. We're just talking.
- I've seen that before. Go!

270
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:17,630
- I'm calling the cops.
- It's okay. I'll go now. Okay.

271
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,830
See you later.

272
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,700
Christoffer...

273
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:04,140
- They're not coming.
- Just as well, maybe.

274
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,450
What the fuck...
They saw us.

275
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,610
- [We said to come alone.]
- Oh, come on.

276
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,690
Drive.

277
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,620
See you tomorrow.
Thanks for hanging out.

278
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:55,640
They disappeared, so I just
needed to find them.

279
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:59,190
There was no alternative.

280
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,770
But I wasn't getting anywhere.

281
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:09,480
Saga got me to start hoping again.
If anyone could find them, it was her.

282
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,890
But she wasn't able to continue.

283
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,380
And...

284
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,840
It's almost eight years
since they disappeared.

285
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:31,970
And I'm beginning to wonder
if I'm slowly trying...

286
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,840
...to leave it behind me.

287
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,250
I just don't know who I'll be
if I stop looking.

288
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:43,830
Who the fuck am I
if I'm not a father...

289
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,610
...looking for his kids?

290
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,830
- Hey.
- Hey.

291
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,620
- Want some company?
- Gladly.

292
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,490
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.

293
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,870
It was good to hear you talk.
Really.

294
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:25,260
After my accident, when they said
I'd never walk again...

295
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:31,200
I couldn't take it. I wasn't going to be
some fucking handicapped person.

296
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:38,160
But I was getting nowhere as well,
until I forced myself to understand -

297
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,100
that that's how it was.

298
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,640
Your shit is worse than mine, but...

299
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:52,660
You talk about your children
as if they're still alive.

300
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,710
- Yeah.
- This may sound wrong, but...

301
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:03,180
It might be easier to move on
if you just recognize they're dead.

302
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,230
I'm sorry.
I don't know shit about it.

303
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:15,000
It's okay. No, it's okay.
It's okay.

304
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:20,650
I know everyone thinks that.
But you just dared to say it.

305
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,030
But it's a very big step.

306
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,920
I'm not really there right now.

307
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:23,030
Why did Mom die?
Are you going to stop looking for us?

308
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,700
- Good morning!
- It hasn't been 24 hours.

309
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:51,100
- You'll get a cell farther from Ardic.
- Why don't you move her instead?

310
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,510
We've already moved your things.

311
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,120
- You don't know how I want them.
- Come on.

312
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:29,580
You're back. Closer to me,
so we can see each other more.

313
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:40,660
- How was it?
- Better. I didn't have to see others.

314
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:45,780
- I may fight more and stay longer.
- You may be forced to.

315
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:52,700
Lucinda said a ton of shit about you.
Otherwise, you didn't miss much.

316
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,510
I got the story back.

317
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,340
- Which story?
- The one I sent to Cecilia.

318
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,780
Her new mother doesn't want her
to get anything from me.

319
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,300
- Will you listen to it?
- No, thank you.

320
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:21,360
- It's in my cell if you change your mind.
- I'm not going to do that.

321
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:26,920
She didn't even open it.
It wasn't because it was bad.

322
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:38,180
It's me. Nothing suggests anything
happened to Margrethe Thormod in the taxi.

323
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,990
The tire marks at Pepparholm
were a Matador MP47...

324
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:48,720
...Hectorra 3. The taxi has Michelins.
What are they saying at the hotel?

325
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:54,870
- I got a list of guests. Lots of names.
- We need to show it to her husband.

326
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:59,180
Does he know who she was fucking?
Maybe it wasn't a guest.

327
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:04,900
There's a café, restaurant, lobby...
What the fuck is this?

328
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:10,200
- This thing on your desk.
- It's a cup.

329
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:16,950
- Supporting a brain-damaged potter?
- Fuck the cup! No cameras?

330
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,240
There weren't any.

331
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:24,880
I just got a USB stick
with video from inside the taxi.

332
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,760
There's Hotel Dronningen,
Carsten Niebuhrs Gade.

333
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,990
Oh! Back up a little.

334
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,510
- Why is she going that way?
- She's not going to the hotel.

335
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,810
What's on that side?

336
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,850
Yeah, yeah.
A gay bar.

337
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,480
No, she's never been there,
as far as I know.

338
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:35,080
- How often are you here?
- Every day. It's my place.

339
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,910
- What's the logo on the door?
- A bear.

340
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:44,700
So you're teddy bears in a cave,
and you aren't hibernating, clearly.

341
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,590
- Do you have a problem with it?
- Only if you stone directors, yeah.

342
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,400
- Do you recognize him?
- Yeah.

343
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:00,120
Taariq Shirazi. I got involved.
I tried to stop the deportation.

344
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:04,590
- Have you met him?
- No.

345
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,420
I just signed a petition and contributed
to the debate. Why?

346
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:13,780
- She's dead, and he's missing.
- What's that got to do with me?

347
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:18,660
Margrethe Thormod might have been here
at the beginning of the week.

348
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,230
She wasn't.

349
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,260
Thanks.

350
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,030
The police were here looking for you.
They know Margrethe was here.

351
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,710
It's best if you move on.

352
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:17,540
- It was the only thing they had.
- Nothing would've been better.

353
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:29,620
- The last one, right?
- No one followed you?

354
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:39,220
- How's school going?
- I don't care about it.

355
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,630
- I said that was dumb.
- Having coffee with the bastard is dumb.

356
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:48,700
- I didn't invite him in.
- I understand if it's tough now.

357
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:54,940
Do you? Do you move all the time
and live on a fucking couch?

358
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:08,980
I understand that he's pissed off.
It's my fault.

359
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,380
I think maybe I can help you.

360
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,240
I think we've found new tenants.

361
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,990
A woman and a son.

362
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:16,450
Sofie and Christoffer Björk.
She has it really hard.

363
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:24,660
- Theo wants his son to have the house.
- He's not right for us. Sofie is perfect.

364
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,540
- And the boy?
- Angry. Powerless.

365
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,270
But malleable.

366
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:44,830
Mm.

367
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,860
- That gay guy...
- Taariq.

368
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,350
No, the lumberjack.
He said he never met the Iranian, right?

369
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:08,150
The Iranian rented a place
from Charlotte Nansen.

370
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,960
- The lumberjack's sister.
- He's not dumb enough to go back.

371
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,750
No, but the lumberjack knows him.
Should we pay him a visit?

372
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:01,720
- Isn't the verdict being delivered today?
- Yep.

373
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:07,590
- What do you have for new evidence?
- A new witness.

374
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:14,330
Saga's mom's psychologist says
the mother talked about hurting her.

375
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:18,190
- Is that all?
- Yeah, but that will sow doubt.

376
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:26,590
- I'll keep my fingers crossed.
- Thanks.

377
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:31,060
- But I hope you were careful.
- What are you talking about?

378
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,540
Martin's in prison.
Hanne's hopping around on one leg.

379
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,730
She's fucking hard on Danish police.

380
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,280
That was a joke.

381
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,320
Isn't that him?

382
00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:00,310
Hey! Police!
Stop, for fuck's sake!

383
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:39,750
Yeah. Hello, Linn.
Have you heard anything?

384
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:24,700
- What did he say?
- HD acquitted me of my mom's murder.

385
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:31,270
- Are they releasing you?
- Do you not know what 'acquit' means?

386
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,790
I'm going to miss you.

387
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:48,220
- When are you leaving?
- As soon as possible.

388
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,570
I'm sorry.

389
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,160
I'm sorry.

389
00:56:51,305 --> 00:57:51,154

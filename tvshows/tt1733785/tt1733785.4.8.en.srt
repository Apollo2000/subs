2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,939
I know where Astrid is.
I'm positive.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,800
Sorry, Astrid.
I wish there was another way.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,160
Lillian had a personal tragedy yesterday.
Jonas Mandrup is taking over.

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,380
I checked Jonas' phones.
He called a prepaid phone several times.

7
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,679
Details from our case
were leaked every time.

8
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,679
Why do you think Tuksen is here?

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,380
Nice people can be useful.
When we get the chance, we go.

10
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:55,000
- Say hi to my friend.
- Hey. I'm Susanne.

11
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:58,439
Hey!

12
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:10,452
EPISODE 8

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,500
How could I be so fucking dumb?
They used me.

14
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,299
- They were good.
- Yeah. But I should be better.

15
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:38,339
- Do you know where they usually stay?
- Nørreport. In that area, anyway.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,140
- Should I look for them?
- If you want.

17
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,439
I'll call when management
is done scolding me. Bye.

18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,439
Sorry!

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,380
- Can't we just go to the police?
- If they'll see us again.

20
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,438
But we can help them this time.
For real.

21
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,539
They'll say, "Thanks for your help."
Then they'll lock us up again.

22
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,240
I need to talk to Henrik Sabroe.
He works in homicide. Okay. Thanks.

23
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,219
Sorry, Henrik Sabroe isn't answering.
Can I take a message?

24
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,340
Say it's the girls who stayed with him
and we know who it is now.

25
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,019
And he should meet us
by the octopus at Den Sorte Plads.

26
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,900
And he should meet them
by the octopus at Den Sorte Plads.

27
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,299
- And your name?
- He'll understand. It's urgent.

28
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,560
But I need...

29
00:04:15,076 --> 00:04:23,819
THE BRIDGE IV

30
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,959
- Saga? Do you have a second?
- Yes.

31
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,758
We've gone through all the material
on Silas Tuksen. Do you see that?

32
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,000
- A weapon is pointed at him.
- It's when he stole the excavator. We've gone through all the material on Silas Tuksen. Do you see that?

33
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:51,019
- A weapon is pointed at him.
- It's when he stole the excavator.

34
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:56,219
We don't see the passenger,
but there's a shadow following him.

35
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,659
- So someone threatened him.
- Yeah.

36
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,259
- He was shot in the head afterward.
- Firing squad?

37
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,500
No. Shot.

38
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,460
But Tuksen's sister and Crabbe's wife
had nothing to do with Tommy.

39
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,360
- So they're not like the other victims?
- No.

40
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,759
- Was there anything else?
- Yeah.

41
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,400
- The hand on the headrest. No gloves.
- Why didn't you say that right away?

42
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:32,430
- That wouldn't have been fun.
- That's exactly what I said.

43
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,639
How strange you've become
since you started having sex.

44
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,560
- Good work.
- Thanks.

45
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,680
Good morning.

46
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,120
I thought I'd let you sleep.
Sit down.

47
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,160
I made American pancakes.

48
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,639
They only have them on Sundays.

49
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,040
Anything special you want to do today?

50
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,719
We need to go back to the hospital,
but that's not until the afternoon.

51
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,199
Yeah, I want to go home.

52
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,200
Back to the village?

53
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,860
- Yeah, I have all my things there.
- I can just have someone get them.

54
00:06:55,159 --> 00:07:00,359
- I want to go home.
- Okay.

55
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,659
Saga, Barbara told me about the film.
Were there fingerprints?

56
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,079
- Yes. I sent them for analysis.
- Good.

57
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,980
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
- It's me.

58
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:20,779
- Yes, I know.
- Why'd I get the whole business card?

59
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:25,300
You didn't. I have a title, address,
and phone number on my business card.

60
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,580
- Could you bring my things home?
- Yes.

61
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,079
- How's it going with you and Astrid?
- How's it going? It's...

62
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,139
- It's hard.
- Your memories must be very hazy.

63
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,660
- Saga...
- It's almost like living with a stranger.

64
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,599
- I have to go. Talk to you later.
- Okay.

65
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,958
What do we do if he doesn't come?
How long should we wait?

66
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,200
I don't know. What do we do if he
doesn't come? How long should we wait?

67
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:21,759
I don't know.

68
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,480
Okay, come on.
Come.

69
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,539
I took them to the movies
as a reward for confiding in me.

70
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,800
Then Ida felt sick,
and they got out...

71
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,740
Sorry, I need to take this.
Have you found them?

72
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,500
No. I've looked. I've asked around.
No one's seen them.

73
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,139
- Could they be anywhere else?
- Not as far as I know.

74
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,780
There was a policeman they stayed with.

75
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,480
- Henrik Sabroe.
- Where does he live?

76
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:12,319
- I don't know, but I can find out.
- I'll find him.

77
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,460
- What do we do now?
- He'll come home at some point.

78
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,379
- I'm hungry.
- He has food. Should we break in?

79
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,599
- Don't you think he'd be mad again?
- Yeah.

80
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,159
- Ida! Run!
- What?

81
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,600
Ida!

82
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,240
No!

83
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,240
How do you feel about that?

84
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,379
- I'm going to my room.
- Do you want help?

85
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,159
No.

86
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,800
- Are you ready?
- We need to go one more place.

87
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,319
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for two girls.

88
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:27,219
- What girls?
- Their names are Julie and Ida.

89
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,100
They ran off on Niels yesterday
when he took them to the movies.

90
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,758
- And you thought they'd come here?
- They stayed here a night or two.

91
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,000
- Yes. Two. - I thought it was worth checking, anyway. 
- And you thought they'd come here? - They stayed here a night or two.

92
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:40,559
- Yes. Two.
- I thought it was worth checking, anyway.

93
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,660
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
- We have a match for the fingerprints.

94
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,360
- Who is it?
- Susanne Winters.

95
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,840
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
I need backup.

96
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,080
Come.

97
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,120
Here.

98
00:15:03,732 --> 00:15:06,232
[Anna - Beloved daughter and sister]

99
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,379
Yeah.

100
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,559
It's really nice.

101
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,759
I was here every week.

102
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,079
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

103
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,840
It's okay.
I miss her too.

104
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,839
Yeah.

105
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,360
Yeah.

106
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,640
Yeah.

107
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:58,299
The girls will tell us if you don't.

108
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,600
You kidnapped them. You shot Saga.
It's over, Susanne.

109
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,599
Or is it Stephanie?

110
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,799
It was Stephanie.

111
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,920
Back then with Tommy.

112
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,120
I knew what he was doing.
That it was dangerous.

113
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,080
So we never used real names.

114
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:44,140
Tommy wanted to leave Nicole
and start fresh with me.

115
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,480
Then you betrayed him.

116
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,159
Left him in the lurch.

117
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,160
I loved him. Understand?

118
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,640
Good. Now we know.

119
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,640
Maybe we can get some details straight.

120
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,080
Shall we begin with
Margrethe Thormod?

121
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,740
I called later and said that
Niels had been in an accident.

122
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,379
- Then I got her at that gay bar.
- But you killed her the day later?

123
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,580
I wasn't ready, but I needed to get her
before she went to Norway.

124
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,700
- Since when could you watch these?
- For as long as I've wanted to.

125
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,779
- What about you? Are you back?
- Visiting. Then we'll see.

126
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:53,079
- Want to see the rest?
- No, I have a meeting. See you later.

127
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,859
I didn't know Moyo was here.
I only knew he wasn't home.

128
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,518
Then Henrik showed up,
so I needed to improvise.

129
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:06,759
- So you shot him?
- Yeah. In the leg. Then Henrik showed up, so I needed to improvise.

130
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,440
- So you shot him?
- Yeah. In the leg.

131
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,399
The plan was for him to suffer
like the others.

132
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,139
And it would have happened
if it wasn't for your bulletproof vest.

133
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,259
- Why did you take Morgan Sonning's car?
- I didn't know whose car it was.

134
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:34,980
- I just wanted Nicole mixed up in it.
- How did you get the key?

135
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,980
I took my car in and saw Tobias
put in the code. 2330.

136
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:47,180
- And the poison that killed Leonora?
- I bought it on the darknet.

137
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,039
You can pay someone to kill, too.
Cheap.

138
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,460
But I wanted to do it myself.

139
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,460
- Damn was she chatty.
- Some serial killers want credit.

140
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,920
- To show how smart they were.
- Even if they get life in prison?

141
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,680
Sometimes they even oppose
their own lawyers.

142
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,200
We've been under pressure. But we have
a culprit, evidence, and a confession.

143
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:14,266
We have a big case that's over.
I'd like to say thank you to you all.

144
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:16,429
Also to those of you
from the other side of the bridge.

145
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,080
You're okay when you get to know you.
And fucking talented. Skål, everyone.

146
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,339
- Saga, do you want a glass?
- No.

147
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,780
- No. Why would I make myself less sharp?
- What's that?

148
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,899
It's a report. I fired my weapon
in a densely populated area.

149
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We can live with that.

150
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,500
You know what?
I think it's a pity you're going back.

151
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,063
I have some paperwork left,
so I'll be back in a couple days.

152
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,771
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course you do.

153
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,679
Lillian?

154
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:07,460
Want to stay and celebrate a little?
Even if it was solved on my watch?

155
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,279
No, thanks.
I'll celebrate later.

156
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,519
Hey.

157
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,919
- What are you doing?
- Packing my things.

158
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:56,799
- I won't live here now you have Astrid.
- No. Maybe that's best.

159
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,480
- Where is she?
- At the hospital until tomorrow.

160
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,459
- Where are you going to live?
- I don't know.

161
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:11,900
I can live where I want now.
The case is over.

162
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,019
It was Susanne Winter, Tommy's lover.
She wanted revenge.

163
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:21,359
She thought they sentenced Tommy to die.
That's why she killed people that way.

164
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,120
- Are you busy?
- No.

165
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,279
Want to stay a bit?

166
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,520
Are we going to have sex?

167
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:56,359
It's no secret this was hard,
but the collaboration with...

168
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,980
Hi.
I didn't know you were joining us.

169
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,819
Will you start and introduce me?
How are we going to do it?

170
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:13,519
It'll be without you.
Lillian will be Lead Investigator again.

171
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,319
Okay.

172
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,619
But can we at least do it together?

173
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:31,140
You can't. We need to have a little chat
about the leaks from the investigation.

174
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,000
Come with me.

175
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,740
If I knew the girls were in the trunk,
I wouldn't have shot.

176
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,940
How are they now?

177
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,019
The youngest broke her arm
and got a concussion.

178
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,395
So they were fleeing a murderer
and they came to see me?

179
00:25:02,895 --> 00:25:04,395
Yes.

180
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,779
- Where are they now?
- At the hospital.

181
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,519
- Rigshospitalet?
- Bispebjerg.

182
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,619
- We were in the village today.
- Why?

183
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,340
Astrid wanted to get her things.

184
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,880
She has that and she has
a secret room with a lot of costumes.

185
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:42,180
- She could have a dissociative disorder.
- Which is?

186
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,339
She creates different personalities
to cope with traumatic experiences.

187
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,560
- But she knows she's dressing up.
- But does she know why?

188
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,000
Huh. In any case...

189
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,200
All those characters have
one thing in common.

190
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,559
All their parents betrayed them.

191
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,560
But you didn't betray them.
They were taken from you.

192
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:17,279
Yeah.

193
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,000
I found this at Frank Wahlgren's today.
Anna, she...

194
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,700
She died of appendicitis because
he didn't drive her to the hospital.

195
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,859
I never saw her that old.
He did.

196
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,880
And on her gravestone
he wrote, "Beloved daughter".

197
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,539
- You're not going to do anything dumb?
- Like what?

198
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:55,199
Like Martin.

199
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,200
No.
No, no. Relax.

200
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:10,980
- My mother did that, too.
- What?

201
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,819
Cut me out of the photos
where I was with Jennifer.

202
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:18,959
We're both really fucked up, huh?

203
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:26,679
I think we've done really well with
the psychosocial difficulties we've had.

204
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,400
I think we're fine.

205
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,940
- Keep them.
- But I don't live here anymore.

206
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,400
No.
But keep them anyway.

207
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,560
See ya.

208
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,919
Yeah.

209
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:16,339
You went to school for something else
before the police academy?

210
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,670
- Yes. Microbiology.
- How long did you study it?

211
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:27,420
If you know that I studied it,
you know how long, too.

212
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,559
Two years.
But I don't know why you stopped.

213
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:37,819
- Because I wanted to be police.
- Why?

214
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,799
I'd changed my mind.

215
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,399
- Two months after your sister's suicide.
- Yes.

216
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,319
- Don't you think that's connected?
- You think that?

217
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,500
We talked about that a little while ago.
Guilt.

218
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,659
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

219
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,800
More like others, you could have seen
how Jennifer was.

220
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:24,960
Understood what she was going to do.
Is that right?

221
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:34,559
I'm sure you did everything you could
to help your sister -

222
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,080
based on the knowledge you had.

223
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,640
Didn't you?

224
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,679
Yes.

225
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,120
You did nothing wrong.

226
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:58,200
You're not guilty of anything.

227
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,359
So you think I'm police
because I feel guilty?

228
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,300
Everything you talked about
the first time you came here...

229
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:19,000
Wasn't it about that? Guilt?

230
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:29,160
But I am police.
What else would I be?

231
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,920
I don't know.
You have to answer that.

232
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:44,839
But to let go of everything you believe,
you need to ask yourself what you want.

233
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,639
What do you want, then?

234
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:08,940
- Hey. How are you doing?
- What are you doing here?

235
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,660
I heard you were here,
so I wanted to see how you were.

236
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:19,318
- Great. Taking care of ourselves.
- You can't live with me.

237
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:19,559
- We don't want to, either.
- Okay. I'd really like to keep in touch. - Great. Taking care of ourselves. - You can't live with me.

238
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,679
- We don't want to, either.
- Okay. I'd really like to keep in touch.

239
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,680
- We don't want your help.
- Good.

240
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:39,159
If you change your mind,
this is my number.

241
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:45,480
Hope your arm feels better.

242
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,059
- Hey. Did we have a meeting?
- No.

243
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:04,039
- But I'd like your help with something.
- If I can, sure.

244
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:09,220
Congratulations.
I heard you solved the case in Denmark.

245
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,220
- It included Sweden, too.
- Congrats anyway.

246
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,339
So what can I help you with?

247
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,840
These are my mother's calendars.
With notes.

248
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,680
These could be the names of drugs.
The numbers could be dosages.

249
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:42,200
I'd like you to go through them and
through Jennifer's journal one more time.

250
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
Okay.

251
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:56,455
I saw you on tv.
I didn't know you were back.

252
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:09,480
I just thought I'd pass by
and see if you were here. You were.

253
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:16,759
- Where are you going?
- To find something to eat.

254
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:25,119
Do you want company? We can find a place
with white tablecloths and nice waiters.

255
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,760
- Yeah. That sounds good.
- Good, then.

256
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:54,380
- I looked at the material you gave me.
- I know. That's why I came here.

257
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:00,299
I took the substances and the dosages
in the calendars -

258
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,099
and compared them
with your sister's journals.

259
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,840
- Why she was hospitalized, symptoms...
- I understand. You don't need to explain.

260
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:17,099
- I consulted a colleague to be sure.
- And what did you conclude?

261
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,660
Your sister's history of illness
could very well have been a result -

262
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,320
of medicating in those dosages
with those substances.

263
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,480
So my mother made Jennifer sick?

264
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,039
From the material I've seen, yes.
So, yes, most likely.

265
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,460
- She had Münchhausen by proxy?
- Once again...

266
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,600
From the material I've seen, yes.

267
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,760
Are you okay?

268
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,479
- I was right.
- I'm getting Astrid. Can we talk later?

269
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:15,719
But my mother had Münchhausen by proxy!
- I was right. - I'm getting Astrid. Can we talk later?

270
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,280
But my mother had
Münchhausen by proxy!

271
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,279
- Okay.
- I just wanted to tell someone.

272
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,519
- Okay. Good. Can we talk later?
- Yes. - Okay. - I just wanted to tell someone.

273
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,720
- Okay. Good. Can we talk later?
- Yes.

274
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,599
Bye.

275
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:35,179
- I didn't know you were coming.
- You said you had information on my case?

276
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,940
And I wanted to apologize
for what I did to you.

277
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:45,459
- What did you want to say?
- I saw that you caught her.

278
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,460
- The one who killed them.
- Yes. There's reason to believe.

279
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,240
I just wanted to say that...
she was here.

280
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,660
- Susanne Winter was here?
- I don't know her name.

281
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,960
- Is that her?
- That's her.

282
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:22,219
Kill you, actually.

283
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:27,980
She wanted me to behead you.
And I didn't want to.

284
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,480
But she had photos of Cecilia.
Do you remember her?

285
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:36,420
My daughter who lives with another
mother now. The one I sent the story to.

286
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,599
Yes, I remember her.

287
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:46,819
She had photos of Cecilia.
She said they'd do terrible things to her.

288
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,319
They?
She said they would do terrible things?

289
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:59,440
No, she said, "we". But that's "they"
when I'm explaining it, isn't it?

290
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:03,739
And she gave you photos?
Do you have them still?

291
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:05,960
Yes.

292
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,680
Find out where and when those photos
were taken, and by whom, if possible.

293
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,840
- Where did they come from?
- A woman I was with in prison.

294
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,440
- Is it related to the case?
- Yes. Something isn't right.

295
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,519
Barbara?

296
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,140
- Are those right?
- Are what right?

297
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,300
- The times.
- Yeah.

298
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,559
- These, too?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

299
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:01,639
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

300
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,300
Were you with Susanne the morning
your wife was kidnapped?

301
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:14,339
Yeah, because we had breakfast together
once a week at a café. We'd talk.

302
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:17,440
Are those times right?

303
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:25,086
Yeah, I had a meeting at 10:30.
We left at twenty past. I was late for it.

304
00:40:25,325 --> 00:40:26,825
Thanks.

305
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,460
- You're not welcome here.
- This is a police matter.

306
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,987
Send someone else.

307
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:06,975
That takes time. I'd have to report you
for obstructing an investigation.

308
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:10,400
- You're kidding.
- No.

309
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,219
- What do you want?
- Was Susanne Winter a customer here...

310
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,879
- before your brother's car disappeared?
- Not that I know.

311
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,119
- Check.
- What was her name? - before your brother's car disappeared? - Not that I know.

312
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,700
- Check.
- What was her name?

313
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,639
It's still her name.
Winter. Susanne Winter.

314
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,180
No, no Susanne Winter.

315
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,679
Anyone with plate number FT84539?

316
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,840
No.

317
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Do you recognize her?

318
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,460
No, I don't recognize her.

319
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,920
- Was there anything else?
- No. You can go back.

320
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:10,920
Sit there. Close the door.

321
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:19,300
Susanne Winter didn't use the alibi
she had for Margrethe's kidnapping.

322
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,779
- Because her alibi doesn't hold up.
- Yes, it does.

323
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:31,340
Susanne Winter left Niels at the café
at 10:20 here.

324
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:36,539
Margrethe was picked up outside
The Cave at 10:40 here.

325
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,140
I drove the quickest way.
It took 27 minutes.

326
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,820
- The 7 minutes might have been traffic.
- No.

327
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:51,420
I used the police lights and left from
the café. Susanne had to pick up the car.

328
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:56,179
She couldn't possibly have picked up
Margrethe from The Cave.

329
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,300
She never brought her car into
Tobias Johansson's garage, either.

330
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,059
And you can't see the key cabinet
from the counter.

331
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:12,640
- You don't think it's her?
- I know that it's not just her.

332
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,080
Do you like it?

333
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,880
Why do you always ask that?
I'd tell you if I didn't like the food.

334
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,720
- I saw Frank.
- Why?

335
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:49,639
Because I wanted to understand.

336
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,780
- Understand what?
- Understand how you were.

337
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:59,079
Understand how it was.

338
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,519
It was how it was.
We lived there with him.

339
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:11,639
You were dead.

340
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:15,960
And he was... or became like a father.

341
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:26,279
But now everything is so strange.

342
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:31,919
It's like it's all wrong,
even if it's right.

343
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:36,479
Because we were there so long.

344
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,880
Yeah.

345
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:45,920
Yeah.

346
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,560
Is he getting out again?

347
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,380
Yes, he is.
He'll get out at some point.

348
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:05,940
But he won't come near you,
and he'll never come here.

349
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:11,919
- If you don't want him to.
- Why would I want that?

350
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,240
Because you were there a very long time
and he was almost a father to you.

351
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:23,799
[In Danish] But you're my father.

352
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:38,359
Thanks for the food.

353
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,600
- Hi.
- Hi, Kevin.

354
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,300
- Am I interrupting?
- No, it's fine.

355
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:08,900
I was just thinking we could celebrate
getting your daughter back.

356
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:15,000
That you've both been through
a tough time. It's alcohol-free.

357
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,219
- Cool.
- I'm interrupting, maybe.

358
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:25,300
- Maybe not now?
- It's okay. Come in.

359
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,259
- Here. I'll help you.
- Are you sure?

360
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,002
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
- Hi, it's John.

361
00:47:32,502 --> 00:47:33,400
I know. Did you find anything?

362
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:38,820
Most of the photos were taken outside
a kindergarten in Staffanstrop.

363
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,380
- But we don't know when.
- By whom?

364
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:47,339
We don't know that, either.
But one thing is a little weird.

365
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:51,739
- The photos are taken through a fence.
- Oh?

366
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:59,800
The fence is 1.5 meters tall. They
could've taken a perfect photo over it.

367
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,620
So why bend down and take it?

368
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,680
- Unless it was a child.
- Or someone in a wheelchair.

369
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,199
Yeah, this looks like a good vintage.

370
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:51,440
Hi, Astrid.

371
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:00,179
- Lillian?
- It's Brian. Henrik isn't answering.

372
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,300
- Isn't he after you?
- I'm not the closest to Henrik now.

373
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,679
- Astrid.
- Send people. I'm on the way.

374
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,320
Did you think you'd get away?
Huh?

375
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:46,920
Don't put a finger on my daughter.

376
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,219
I miss him every day.

377
00:49:54,519 --> 00:50:00,800
Understand? I tried to kill myself
from that balcony.

378
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:04,480
But my back healed.

379
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,940
- You sick fuck!
- Hi, Astrid.

380
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:13,039
- You are so pretty.
- Shut your mouth.

381
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:18,500
When someone you love dies,
you carry that forever.

382
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,640
Don't put a finger on my daughter!
Don't you touch her!

383
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,180
- Henrik, look at her.
- No!

384
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,840
Look at her!

385
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:41,879
Look at her!

386
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,659
- I'm here. Where are you?
- 5 minutes away. Is Brian there?

387
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,360
- I don't know.
- Wait for us.

388
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,900
- Tommy trusted you. You know that?
- You're going to rot in hell, you pig.

389
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:14,439
I'm going to fucking kill you
if put a finger on my daughter.

390
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,280
- Fuck you.
- Look at her!

391
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:23,839
If you love her, then look at her.

392
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:29,039
Fuck you!

393
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,559
Henrik, look at her. I'll keep hurting her
until you look at her. Understand?

394
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:56,460
You decide how long it takes.

395
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,360
Take me.
Come on. Take me instead.

396
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:06,099
You think you'll get off that easy?
You think you'll get off that easy?!

397
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,960
Come take me.

398
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,400
Astrid.

399
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:18,800
I'm sorry.

400
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:21,719
I'm sorry.

401
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,720
I'll never leave you.
I'll never leave.

402
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:33,500
I'll never leave again.
I love you.

403
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,600
Shut up.
Shut up!

404
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,840
- Did you hear anything?
- The operation went well.

405
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,820
I don't dare think what would have
happened if you hadn't come.

406
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,500
Don't, then.

407
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,960
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

408
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:00,480
Some time I'd really like
for you meet Astrid.

409
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,019
It will have to be later.
I've decided to go away a while.

410
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,840
- Where?
- I don't know.

411
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,000
What are you going to do?

412
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:19,739
- What I want.
- What's that?

413
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,679
I don't know yet.

414
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,199
- Do you know what I said to Kevin?
- You mean to Brian?

415
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:37,100
- Do you know what I said?
- No, how would I know that?

416
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,360
I said that I needed you
more than you needed me.

417
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,280
- I see.
- But that isn't right, is it?

418
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,199
No, it isn't.

419
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:01,159
Let me know when you come back.

420
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,306
Saga Norén.

420
00:57:23,305 --> 00:58:23,774

PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:12,764
The murder of Margrethe Thormod,
Director of Immigration, has received...

3
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:16,443
The press is going crazy.
They want to know if it's terrorism.

4
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:19,803
Red October?
It sounds like the radical left.

5
00:00:19,923 --> 00:00:24,282
No films where you see them,
no spokesmen, no manifestos.

6
00:00:24,402 --> 00:00:27,642
- How is Saga doing?
- Not so good.

7
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:35,161
- Where's that gay Iranian they deported?
- Taariq Shirazi went underground.

8
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:39,960
There was a marked increase in threats
against Thormod after the deportation.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,520
They know Margrethe was here.
It's probably best if you move on.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,639
Get out! I'll call the cops.

11
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,759
I think we've found new tenants.
A woman and a son. She has it really bad.

12
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,838
Why did Mom die?
Are you going to stop looking for us?

13
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:04,397
They disappeared almost 8 years ago.
Am I starting to leave it behind me?

14
00:01:04,517 --> 00:01:08,997
The Supreme Court acquitted me
of the murder of my mother.

EPISODE 2

17
00:01:48,552 --> 00:01:52,192
I'll call you right back.
What happened?

18
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:55,351
Hey! What happened to you?
Can you hear me?

19
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:58,111
- What happened?
- I don't know. She fainted.

20
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:01,870
Hello. Are you awake?
She just fainted all of a sudden.

21
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,030
Can you hear me? Hello?
Are you with us?

22
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,630
Do you think we should
call an ambulance?

23
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,869
What happened?

24
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:14,509
- Sorry.
- Are you with us?

25
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:19,028
- Let's do it.
- Should we call an ambulance?

26
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:21,708
She just woke up.

27
00:02:21,828 --> 00:02:25,147
Hey. Try to get up.

28
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:28,067
- Hey, are you okay?
- Sorry. Thank you.

29
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:32,227
Yeah, I'm totally fine.
I just get a little dizzy sometimes.

30
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:35,706
- Should we call someone?
- No, it's fine. Thank you.

31
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:17,701
How did it go?

32
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:24,900
- 150 kroner.
- I have this, too.

33
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,940
You can get at least
1000 kroner for this.

34
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,939
Cool.

35
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:45,438
THE BRIDGE IV

36
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:07,327
Hi.

37
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:13,727
- How's it going?
- Good.

38
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:21,966
You were damn lucky.

39
00:05:31,844 --> 00:05:33,924
Did Elsa say anything?

40
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:37,524
She said she felt betrayed.

41
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:41,443
She thought it could somehow
get you to stay.

42
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:46,962
I'm going to work again.

43
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:50,322
Don't you think it would be good
to take it a little easy after this?

44
00:05:50,442 --> 00:05:56,201
No, returning to work
will help me put this behind me.

45
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,680
No.

46
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,239
We know you're in contact with Taariq
Shirazi. He lives at your sister's place.

47
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:16,039
He shows up outside your apartment.

48
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:22,238
Yeah, yeah.

49
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:30,717
Are you screwing, or what?

50
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:36,036
Is he so good that it's worth
getting mixed up in a murder case -

51
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:40,756
- that could end up being
classified as terrorism?

52
00:06:41,796 --> 00:06:45,675
Hi. Where are we?

53
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:49,595
He still thinks it's a good idea
to keep quiet.

54
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:54,314
You know why you're here.
Margrethe Thormod was at your club.

55
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:58,354
What was she doing there?
Who was she meeting?

56
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:03,873
If he walks out that door,
then I'll answer your questions.

57
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:07,712
- Why's that? What did I do?
- Silas, we need to know why...

58
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:11,512
As soon as he walks out that door,
I'll answer your questions.

59
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:20,336
- Jonas.
- Are you serious?

60
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:37,709
Margrethe was there to meet Taariq.
He doesn't know why.

61
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:40,788
- So he says.
- Does he know where Taariq is now?

62
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:45,268
Maybe, but he won't tell,
and that's probably understandable.

63
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:50,867
Is it? I'm all for feeling sorry for him,
but he's our primary suspect.

64
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:55,067
- Silas isn't going to say anything.
- Maybe I should have been in there.

65
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:00,746
Lillian.

66
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:05,865
Saga is being released today.
I'd like to have her here.

67
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,545
Isn't it a little early?
She's had a hard time.

68
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:11,945
She needs it, Lillian.

69
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:16,384
She needs to be a detective again.
You know she's damn good.

70
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:22,063
And Red October is Swedish.

71
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:25,183
I'll have a chat with Linn.

72
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:32,382
Lillian. Do you seriously mean that?

73
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:35,422
- Are you seriously thinking of using her?
- Saga?

74
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:39,101
- She's just come out of prison.
- Because she was acquitted.

75
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:43,381
Is she stable enough? You said yourself
that she had a hard time.

76
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:46,700
- Can you really afford more mistakes?
- Mistakes?

77
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,100
Martin's in prison.
Hanne lost a leg.

78
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,659
No one was charged with murdering Danish
citizens; the suspect committed suicide.

79
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:57,739
- Are you finished?
- I'm just trying to help you.

80
00:10:49,205 --> 00:10:51,805
You've always had only clean hits.

81
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:55,404
There were errors both in your shooting
and when you drew your weapon.

82
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:58,644
You passed, but
the result was worse.

83
00:10:58,764 --> 00:11:01,004
I couldn't practice.

84
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:05,563
- So that doesn't concern you?
- No.

85
00:11:08,883 --> 00:11:11,602
Welcome back.

86
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:25,601
Can I start working now?

87
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,400
Lillian asked for your help
with Henrik Sabroe in Denmark.

88
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,479
Is that okay? You can start
by reading through the case.

89
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:50,437
- You can borrow my office for a bit.
- Great.

90
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:01,596
Yeah, I'm looking at it now.

91
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:07,195
It just confirms what I said.
It's not Red October.

92
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:10,395
- Yeah, I can write something.
- Hello.

93
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:12,995
It's no problem.

94
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:18,274
The usual rate?
Okay, good.

95
00:12:18,394 --> 00:12:22,474
You'll hear from me.
Yep. Bye.

96
00:12:22,594 --> 00:12:24,993
You're not ready?

97
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:29,713
I'm going to run
10 kilometers today.

98
00:12:30,673 --> 00:12:35,232
- Do you have a hangover?
- No. I was beaten up when I came home.

99
00:12:36,592 --> 00:12:40,311
- By that group?
- No, that girl you brought home.

100
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:44,431
Robin S.
Turns out her ex is fucking jealous.

101
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:49,990
Seriously. You need to stop
pretending to be me. Understood?

102
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,870
- I mean it! That was the last time.
- Yeah, I promise.

103
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,029
Scout's honor.
On Mom's grave.

104
00:12:57,469 --> 00:13:00,629
- So no run today?
- No.

105
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:07,188
- Should I run the jacuzzi instead?
- Patrik, I have to work. See you later.

106
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:11,467
Okay. I'll just have some breakfast.

107
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:16,507
How's it really going
with your NA meetings?

108
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:19,426
- It's going okay.
- Just okay?

109
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:25,026
- No, no, it's fine. It's helping.
- I don't want any more problems.

110
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:30,545
- Do you think this will be a problem?
- It's Saga, after all.

111
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:35,145
Hey.

112
00:13:36,104 --> 00:13:38,064
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

113
00:13:41,264 --> 00:13:44,103
- Good to see you.
- Yes.

114
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,303
Yeah...

115
00:13:49,543 --> 00:13:51,742
Well, where is my desk?

116
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:54,262
We don't have fixed desks,
so you can sit where you want.

117
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:57,142
Why don't you have fixed desks?

118
00:13:57,262 --> 00:14:01,341
It's something we're testing to be
more flexible and increase creativity.

119
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:04,941
Objectivity is more important
to an officer than creativity.

120
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:08,180
Yeah, but now we're trying this.

121
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,420
What should I do with my things?

122
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,099
Just take this around with you.
There.

123
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:21,699
- There you are.
- You can sit there.

124
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:34,297
- Hi. Jonas Mandrup.
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

125
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:37,337
Yeah, I know that.
I've heard a lot about you.

126
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:40,376
We'll have a briefing for Saga.

127
00:14:40,496 --> 00:14:44,176
That isn't necessary.
I've read all the material.

128
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:57,014
Red October put out a video
on the internet today.

129
00:14:57,134 --> 00:15:00,734
- They claim they didn't kill Thormod.
- I know. I saw it.

130
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:03,894
It's been impossible to track them,
but we're trying.

131
00:15:04,014 --> 00:15:07,213
You questioned Silas Tuxen this morning.
Did you get anything?

132
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,693
He says Thormod was meeting Taariq.

133
00:15:09,813 --> 00:15:13,412
But he didn't say where Taariq was,
assuming he knew.

134
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:16,572
What reason did she have
to meet with Taariq?

135
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:24,891
None. She had absolutely no reason
to be in contact with him.

136
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:27,611
We have a witness who says
that they met.

137
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:31,170
Maybe he's lying, or
maybe he just misunderstood.

138
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:36,170
She introduced herself. As far as we know,
he has no reason to lie.

139
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:40,449
Last time, you said she was cheating.

140
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:44,409
- Let me hear it.
- Hear what?

141
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:48,648
You come here with crazy allegations.
How far along are you?

142
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:52,967
For technical reasons, we can't disclose
details of the investigation.

143
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,647
No details. I'm asking how far
along you are, if you have suspects...

144
00:15:56,767 --> 00:16:00,407
Niels. We can't disclose anything.

145
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:06,886
- Niels, you'll hear from us.
- I want to see where she was killed.

146
00:16:07,006 --> 00:16:10,845
- It's still cordoned off.
- Why? Because you found something?

147
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:16,885
Did you not hear that we can't disclose
details about the investigation?

148
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:19,804
Discoveries at the crime scene
are classified as details.

149
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:30,483
Why do you want to see
where it happened?

150
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:34,562
It could be horrible.

151
00:16:34,682 --> 00:16:39,242
- I need it to move on.
- She was stoned to death, Niels.

152
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:47,481
- Are you coming?
- Yeah, I'll be there in a little bit.

153
00:17:09,518 --> 00:17:11,798
Yeah, hi, it's me.

154
00:17:11,918 --> 00:17:15,357
No, no, no.
They know nothing.

155
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:18,917
Continue as planned.

156
00:17:35,635 --> 00:17:38,874
I haven't gotten my paycheck.

157
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:42,314
- Good thing you said it.
- We agreed on the end of the week.

158
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:45,154
Take it easy.
I haven't forgotten.

159
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:05,591
Do you think it's him?

160
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,430
We're the sellers.

161
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,629
Can I see?

162
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:27,388
The money first. 1000 kroner.

163
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:30,508
Come on, man.
Let me see the passport.

164
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:39,147
The money.

165
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:45,706
Let go! Give me the passport now!

166
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:48,586
Just give him the passport, Julia.

167
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:51,145
Hey, what are you doing?

168
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:56,425
What are you doing?
Let her go! Let her go, I say!

169
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:18,662
Are you okay?
What are you doing here?

170
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:25,501
Do you have any food we can have?

171
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,940
- And you live off of selling passports?
- Among other things.

172
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,380
Do you have one I can buy?

173
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,619
If you're blond, 55, and named Louise.

174
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:46,259
But if we get hold of one
that looks like you, then...

175
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:48,618
Okay. Thanks.

176
00:19:50,698 --> 00:19:53,658
I'm going back to work.

177
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:57,937
- But take care of yourselves.
- Likewise.

178
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,289
Okay, make yourselves at home.

179
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:04,929
- I don't know if we can afford it.
- Don't worry.

180
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:07,409
Come.

181
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:19,447
Here's a bedroom.

182
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:26,886
There's another down there.

183
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:33,005
Bathroom.
Kitchen.

184
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:37,405
Living room.

185
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:46,684
- Can you make do out here?
- I have no choice.

186
00:21:46,804 --> 00:21:51,163
Not much goes on here, but it's safe,
and that's the most important thing.

187
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:54,563
- Why is it empty?
- The previous tenants...

188
00:21:54,683 --> 00:21:57,242
Didn't respect the contract.

189
00:21:57,362 --> 00:22:02,162
- What kind of contract?
- It's nothing special.

190
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:07,321
I'll come back to help with furniture.
There's some in the silo we drove by.

191
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:11,321
You can just take it. It costs nothing.
We help each other here.

192
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:15,960
If anything comes up,
I live just down the road.

193
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,960
- Okay, see you later.
- Thanks.

194
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,479
It's not so bad.

195
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:31,318
It'll be fine.

196
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:41,917
Yeah?

197
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:46,236
I thought we agreed that Alexis
would move into that empty house.

198
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:50,996
We did, but the situation has changed.

199
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:54,635
- Frank's friends showed up.
- Yes, but it's not Frank's town.

200
00:22:54,755 --> 00:22:56,915
It's mine.

201
00:22:57,035 --> 00:23:01,754
And you know what I think about
those who question my decisions.

202
00:23:14,913 --> 00:23:18,832
Here are the keys to my house.

203
00:23:19,872 --> 00:23:21,992
Am I going to live at your place?

204
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,752
- Do you have another place to live?
- No.

205
00:23:25,911 --> 00:23:28,751
I'll find my own apartment,
or a hotel in the meantime.

206
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:32,991
- Or you can just live at my place.
- You live there.

207
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,629
Saga, Henrik.
We know where Taariq is.

208
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:53,148
Lillian. It's me and Henrik leading
this investigation, right?

209
00:23:53,268 --> 00:23:55,748
Yes, but right now I'm sending
Saga and Henrik out.

210
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:58,907
- You're prioritizing her over me.
- She's not the competition.

211
00:23:59,027 --> 00:24:04,187
Equality before competence.
It's not the first time, is it?

212
00:24:20,745 --> 00:24:25,864
Taariq Shirazi. Henrik Sabroe, police.
We want to talk to you.

213
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:28,424
Taariq!

214
00:24:28,544 --> 00:24:31,343
Hey, stop!
Taariq!

215
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:34,663
- Open the door!
- Put your hands against the wall!

216
00:24:34,783 --> 00:24:38,422
Put your hands against the door!
Turn around!

217
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:44,622
You called them, huh?
You called them, huh? You shit!

218
00:24:44,742 --> 00:24:46,901
You shit!

219
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:57,700
Margrethe Thormod was killed by stoning.
That punishment is used in Iran.

220
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,460
You said if you went back
you were sentenced to death.

221
00:25:02,939 --> 00:25:04,899
Look at the photo.

222
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:08,939
Margrethe Thormod was the most
responsible for your deportation.

223
00:25:14,978 --> 00:25:19,337
I didn't kill her.
She tried to help me.

224
00:25:19,457 --> 00:25:23,737
- With what?
- Money, a new passport, a new identity.

225
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:27,376
So first she deports you,
and then she helps you stay?

226
00:25:27,496 --> 00:25:31,656
She said she had to make
bad decisions -

227
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:35,575
- and that there's something
wrong with the system.

228
00:25:35,695 --> 00:25:38,335
And so she'd be able to sleep at night.

229
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:41,895
- By breaking the law?
- By being humane.

230
00:25:42,015 --> 00:25:46,934
- I wasn't the first she helped.
- So you confirm the meeting at The Cave?

231
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:49,334
Yes.

232
00:25:49,454 --> 00:25:52,973
- How long was she there?
- 30 minutes. Maybe a little more.

233
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:58,053
But she got a call and was very stressed.
She said she needed to leave right away.

234
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:00,932
- Who called her?
- I don't know.

235
00:26:01,052 --> 00:26:04,292
- Where was she going?
- I don't know.

236
00:26:04,412 --> 00:26:08,211
- She jumped into a black car.
- What was the make? Model?

237
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:10,571
I know nothing about cars.
It was black.

238
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:14,411
- Did you see the plate number?
- No.

239
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,969
We'll just take a break.

240
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:33,688
It's good.

241
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:38,248
- Elderflower?
- No.

242
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:47,127
Do you own the whole town?
And all the houses?

243
00:26:47,247 --> 00:26:52,086
Yeah, since 1998, when my husband
committed suicide. Up on the farm.

244
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:58,525
Frank mentioned something
about a contract.

245
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:04,164
We don't care where
you come from -

246
00:27:04,284 --> 00:27:08,084
- what you believe in,
or how much money you have -

247
00:27:08,204 --> 00:27:12,403
- or who you sleep with.
We're interested in only one thing.

248
00:27:12,523 --> 00:27:16,923
You should be the best version
of yourselves so long as you're here.

249
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:21,842
- What does that mean?
- You should be good people.

250
00:27:21,962 --> 00:27:26,162
Take care of the town, of nature -

251
00:27:26,282 --> 00:27:29,281
- of the land.
Help each other -

252
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:32,001
- make a little extra effort.

253
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:36,200
Be the best version of yourselves
and hope -

254
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,600
- that it's enough
to be allowed to stay.

255
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:58,398
Here's the rental contract.

256
00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:03,677
So...
Tell me a little about yourselves.

257
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:27,394
Is this your cell phone?

258
00:28:28,434 --> 00:28:29,714
Yes.

259
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:33,393
The call Margrethe Thormod received
when she was with you -

260
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:36,513
- came from this phone.

261
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:45,032
There's a GPS program installed
that's tracking another cell phone.

262
00:28:46,232 --> 00:28:48,392
Margrethe Thormod's.

263
00:28:54,111 --> 00:28:56,391
I don't understand.

264
00:28:56,511 --> 00:29:01,710
A program in your phone shows
where Margrethe Thormod's phone is -

265
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,270
- with almost exact precision.

266
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:11,949
But I don't have...
I don't understand.

267
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:15,388
I got that phone today.

268
00:29:15,508 --> 00:29:18,468
- You got it today?
- Yes.

269
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,507
- From whom?
- From two girls.

270
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:25,270
- What are their names?
- I don't know.

271
00:29:26,018 --> 00:29:27,603
Where did you meet them?

272
00:29:27,747 --> 00:29:31,786
It was outside the restaurant.
They were selling a passport to a man -

273
00:29:31,906 --> 00:29:35,546
- and he wanted to take it from them,
but I came out to help them...

274
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:38,425
- ...and as thanks, I got the phone.
- Just like that?

275
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:41,905
They just give you their phone
as thanks for helping?

276
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:46,264
It wasn't their phone.
I think they stole it like the passport.

277
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:51,944
- How old were they?
- Young. 14, maybe 15.

278
00:29:52,064 --> 00:29:56,143
It's hard to say. One was younger.
I think they were sisters.

279
00:29:56,263 --> 00:29:59,503
- And you've never seen them before?
- No.

280
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:05,302
So two young girls you'd never met.
You don't know their names.

281
00:30:05,422 --> 00:30:10,021
They just tell you they're criminals,
and then give you their cell phone.

282
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:26,739
You don't believe me? Huh?
I got it from them!

283
00:30:27,939 --> 00:30:32,219
I promise it's true!
I got it from them!

284
00:30:34,818 --> 00:30:37,138
You have to believe me!

285
00:30:53,136 --> 00:30:55,336
There.

286
00:30:55,456 --> 00:30:59,895
We've had 11 reported pickpockets
in this area in the last 14 days.

287
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:04,055
The same pattern.
Young girl acts sick, people help -

288
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:07,094
- she gets better,
and they find they've been robbed.

289
00:31:07,214 --> 00:31:10,294
- Where's Taariq's restaurant?
- It's here.

290
00:31:10,414 --> 00:31:14,373
- We believe him now? Huh?
- Saga.

291
00:31:14,493 --> 00:31:18,613
Technicians found two sets of fingerprints
on the phone besides Taariq's.

292
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:23,452
- Small. Could be young girls'.
- Do we know who owns the phone?

293
00:31:23,572 --> 00:31:27,092
- The murderer wouldn't have left tracks.
- Cameras?

294
00:31:27,212 --> 00:31:30,172
They managed to avoid the cameras.

295
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:34,611
- Okay, what do we do?
- Taariq stays. We put out an APB.

296
00:31:34,731 --> 00:31:37,571
- So we believe him.
- We can't take any chances.

297
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:42,930
If they stole it from our culprit, they
must be found. We'll hold Taariq.

298
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:49,649
Hello, hello!

299
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:03,367
In school, he rips paper into shreds
and sharpens pencils.

300
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:06,407
Hello, hello!
Who do we have here?

301
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:10,287
Take it easy, honey. Out.
Come on, out. Come on.

302
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:17,886
I know most of them like you -

303
00:32:18,006 --> 00:32:20,685
- but my daughter is afraid of clowns.

304
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:24,565
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- I said it before.

305
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:27,724
It must have slipped my mind. Sorry.
Does she want a balloon animal?

306
00:32:27,844 --> 00:32:30,964
No, she doesn't.

307
00:32:41,443 --> 00:32:44,562
Hello, hello!

308
00:32:45,722 --> 00:32:47,522
He's gone now.

309
00:32:48,682 --> 00:32:51,481
Are you okay?

310
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:56,001
Shall we keep reading?

311
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:58,761
- Hey, Patrik.
- Hey.

312
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:02,200
There's a girl who doesn't
like clowns.

313
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,200
I know. Leonora.
The nurses told us.

314
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,959
- When did they say that?
- At the morning meeting.

315
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:10,919
- Where was I?
- You were next to me.

316
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,119
Ah, I see. Yep.

317
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:18,038
See you tomorrow.
Thanks for today.

318
00:33:25,197 --> 00:33:30,397
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things -

319
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:33,276
- I cannot change -

320
00:33:33,396 --> 00:33:36,596
- the courage to change the things I can -

321
00:33:36,716 --> 00:33:40,875
- and the wisdom to tell the difference.

322
00:33:44,195 --> 00:33:47,994
Congrats.
Isn't it great she was acquitted?

323
00:33:48,114 --> 00:33:50,914
Yeah. Thanks.

324
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:55,114
- It's tea water.
- Perfect.

325
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:56,953
Thanks.

326
00:33:58,153 --> 00:34:01,393
- Are you together?
- Why do you think that?

327
00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:04,792
It sounded that way
when you talked about her.

328
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:07,272
It's not that simple.

329
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:12,031
- Either you're together or not.
- That's not how it is with her.

330
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:18,311
- Why not?
- Because she is who she is.

331
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,710
How did you meet?

332
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:26,230
I wanted her help to find the girls.

333
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,509
Then it became something else.

334
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:32,389
You don't know what?

335
00:34:32,509 --> 00:34:36,868
The thing is, I need her more
than she needs me.

336
00:34:39,308 --> 00:34:41,988
Well, that's shitty.

337
00:34:43,588 --> 00:34:45,387
Yeah.

338
00:35:06,265 --> 00:35:10,384
- Do you know what time it is?
- 10:07 PM.

339
00:35:11,384 --> 00:35:13,984
You can't be an investigator
24 hours a day.

340
00:35:14,104 --> 00:35:18,663
- But I am.
- Come on.

341
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,623
We'll continue tomorrow.

342
00:35:36,981 --> 00:35:39,701
No, no.
No, no.

343
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:41,940
Don't bring that.

344
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:03,058
- I'm going now.
- Yeah. Great. Thanks for today.

345
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:06,617
Is that okay?

346
00:36:06,737 --> 00:36:11,257
- I can certainly stay.
- No, it's fine. Thanks a lot, Susanne.

347
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,696
What are you thinking about?

348
00:36:14,816 --> 00:36:21,176
- Margrethe... Her helping Taariq.
- If he did it?

349
00:36:21,296 --> 00:36:27,175
Sometimes she needed to make decisions
she didn't agree with.

350
00:36:27,295 --> 00:36:31,174
Well, that's fine.
She was a good person.

351
00:36:31,294 --> 00:36:36,054
She just never told me, and
we didn't have any secrets.

352
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:40,573
Do you think... Do you think
there was something she didn't tell me?

353
00:36:40,693 --> 00:36:45,013
Do you mean what the police suggested?
That she was cheating?

354
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:48,692
Just...
Did she say anything to you?

355
00:36:48,812 --> 00:36:52,412
- Anything that might get her killed?
- No.

356
00:36:52,532 --> 00:36:55,171
And she loved you.

357
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:57,291
So much.

358
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:31,247
- Saga, what are you doing?
- Checking apartments in Malmo.

359
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:47,365
When I asked you -

360
00:37:47,485 --> 00:37:51,964
- why you didn't want to live here,
you said it was because I live here.

361
00:37:52,084 --> 00:37:54,924
I'm not good at living with anyone.

362
00:37:55,044 --> 00:37:58,323
Okay. What about you and me?

363
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:03,203
Sometimes I'll live here, sometimes
I'll live alone, and we'll have sex.

364
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:07,002
- Only with each other?
- Do you want sex with other people?

365
00:38:07,122 --> 00:38:10,602
I'm just trying to understand
what we're doing.

366
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:16,281
- I'll never be like Alice.
- I know that.

367
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:21,881
- Do you still see her?
- No.

368
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:24,360
What about the children?
Do you see them?

369
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,400
Yeah.

370
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,399
- So it has nothing to do with the drugs?
- No.

371
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:39,798
We weren't doing so great,
Alice and me.

372
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:44,598
Did you have a bad relationship?

373
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:48,157
We had some problems.

374
00:38:48,277 --> 00:38:51,077
- Did you fight?
- No.

375
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:55,796
She pulled away more and more.

376
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,236
Got very quiet.

377
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:02,356
We didn't really talk.

378
00:39:07,075 --> 00:39:09,835
But I'm glad you're here.

379
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:13,074
Yeah, you said that.

380
00:40:06,428 --> 00:40:09,067
Bro, is that you?

381
00:40:13,027 --> 00:40:15,147
What are you doing?

382
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:20,186
You can't be here.

383
00:40:20,306 --> 00:40:23,186
You can't be here.

384
00:40:24,945 --> 00:40:27,945
Do you hear what I'm saying?
You can't be here!

385
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:34,144
Do you hear what I'm saying?
Get out of here!

386
00:40:35,624 --> 00:40:39,264
Go! Hello?
Get out!

387
00:41:29,537 --> 00:41:31,817
- You couldn't sleep?
- No.

388
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:34,657
We thought it was
an unknown perpetrator.

389
00:41:34,777 --> 00:41:38,296
If it was bad between you and Alice,
she might have gone willingly.

390
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:42,456
No, she didn't do that.
It wasn't that bad.

391
00:41:42,576 --> 00:41:44,655
You didn't talk about it,
so it might have been.

392
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:47,775
She would never have taken
the children from me.

393
00:41:47,895 --> 00:41:51,655
- Did Alice have any girlfriends?
- Yeah. Why?

394
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,494
Women trust each other
if there are relationship problems.

395
00:41:54,614 --> 00:41:57,334
Yeah, but I talked to all of them
after they disappeared.

396
00:41:57,454 --> 00:42:00,973
- It's not in the reports here.
- Because they didn't know anything.

397
00:42:01,093 --> 00:42:05,733
- Or they didn't want to tell you.
- Alice didn't disappear willingly, Saga.

398
00:42:05,853 --> 00:42:09,092
She was abducted or killed.

399
00:42:09,212 --> 00:42:13,532
And I need to realize soon
that we'll never find the girls.

400
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,570
I'm just going to lie down again.

401
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:48,848
She sometimes doubted
if he still loved her.

402
00:42:50,847 --> 00:42:54,167
Do you know if Alice talked
to others about this?

403
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:58,166
She mentioned someone from work.

404
00:42:58,286 --> 00:43:01,806
- Do you know who it was?
- No, she never said.

405
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:05,445
- Man, woman?
- A man, but it was just a coworker.

406
00:43:05,565 --> 00:43:10,565
She loved Henrik. She would never
take the children and just disappear.

407
00:43:10,685 --> 00:43:13,884
I need to go.
You'll have to pay.

408
00:43:15,004 --> 00:43:19,004
Lise said Alice talked a good deal
with a man at work.

409
00:43:19,124 --> 00:43:23,563
We have a list of male employees.
I want to take a look at it.

410
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:29,722
You could have asked me
to come along with Lise.

411
00:43:29,842 --> 00:43:34,562
She might not have been honest
about what Alice thought about you.

412
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:37,961
- Was she, then?
- Yes.

413
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:43,401
- Do you want to know what she said?
- Do I?

414
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:47,680
- That's what I asked.
- Yeah. What did she say?

415
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,240
She said you were more a policeman
than a husband.

416
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,279
That you were out with coworkers
and drank too much at times.

417
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:58,679
And that you let Alice take care of
the children and took her for granted.

418
00:43:58,799 --> 00:44:02,158
- Also that she wasn't sure you loved her.
- Thanks, that's fine.

419
00:44:02,278 --> 00:44:05,838
- But she said more.
- Yeah, but it's fine. Thanks a lot, Saga.

420
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:08,878
You're welcome.

421
00:44:15,997 --> 00:44:20,556
The neighbor called it in. They found
him dead in the jacuzzi this morning.

422
00:44:24,436 --> 00:44:27,555
I talked to the prosecutor
about Richard Dahlqvist.

423
00:44:27,675 --> 00:44:30,955
The connection to Red October
and Margrethe Thormod is enough -

424
00:44:31,075 --> 00:44:33,275
- that the case is yours.

425
00:44:37,994 --> 00:44:40,994
No signs of violence.

426
00:44:41,114 --> 00:44:43,593
He didn't drown.

427
00:44:43,713 --> 00:44:47,793
- Heart attack?
- Unusual for a man his age and shape.

428
00:44:47,913 --> 00:44:50,592
- What are you doing?
- Stay there.

429
00:44:50,712 --> 00:44:53,112
I live here!
It's my house.

430
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,192
I'm asking you to stay there.

431
00:44:55,312 --> 00:44:58,871
- Saga Norén, Malmo Police. Who are you?
- Richard Dahlqvist. I live here.

432
00:45:00,151 --> 00:45:03,191
You have a twin brother.

433
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:17,229
He was probably murdered
instead of you.

434
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:23,428
- Did you feel threatened?
- No.

435
00:45:23,548 --> 00:45:27,108
Were you in contact with Red October?

436
00:45:27,228 --> 00:45:32,027
- It's not them. It's not them.
- Were you in contact with them?

437
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:35,267
Yeah. Some texts.

438
00:45:35,387 --> 00:45:38,027
- Then we need your cell phone.
- Why?

439
00:45:38,147 --> 00:45:40,586
Because of the texts.

440
00:46:15,262 --> 00:46:20,021
We put things here we don't need,
but could be useful to others.

441
00:46:20,141 --> 00:46:23,261
You can just take what you want.

442
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:26,701
- You're not coming?
- I'll stay here.

443
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:29,500
- See you later, then.
- Yeah. Bye.

444
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:20,614
Hey.

445
00:47:21,654 --> 00:47:23,894
Did I scare you?

446
00:47:25,493 --> 00:47:28,693
Frank said I could take what I want.

447
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:32,292
- Frank is my dad.
- Okay.

448
00:47:33,452 --> 00:47:36,772
- Astrid.
- Christoffer.

449
00:47:39,652 --> 00:47:43,371
- This was mine once.
- Is it okay if I take it?

450
00:47:43,491 --> 00:47:47,091
- It wouldn't be here otherwise.
- I guess not.

451
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,050
- I can help you.
- Okay.

452
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:56,210
There.

453
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:04,928
- I'll get Lillian.
- Okay.

454
00:48:15,247 --> 00:48:17,927
- Do you want something?
- Yes. I sat there.

455
00:48:18,047 --> 00:48:21,366
Yeah, okay. Now I sit here.
It's a flexible office.

456
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:29,245
- I heard you were in Sweden.
- We'll brief you when Lillian comes.

457
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:32,445
Then we don't have to do it twice.

458
00:48:32,565 --> 00:48:34,605
Okay.

459
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,318
- Patrik Dahlqvist.
- He worked as a hospital clown.

460
00:49:29,438 --> 00:49:32,878
Richard's twin brother.
We think they were after him.

461
00:49:32,998 --> 00:49:35,837
It was Richard who was
in contact with Red October.

462
00:49:35,957 --> 00:49:39,357
The day before last, both brothers went
to meet them, but they didn't show.

463
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:42,476
Richard received a text
to meet alone next time.

464
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:46,036
- They were watching him, then.
- Saga, you're bleeding.

465
00:49:46,156 --> 00:49:49,915
- Where is Richard now?
- Linn got a hotel room in Malmo.

466
00:49:50,035 --> 00:49:52,661
- The video from Red October?
- Nothing.

467
00:49:52,832 --> 00:49:54,661
Everyone leaves digital tracks.

468
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:57,914
- Not these people.
- Or you haven't found them.

469
00:50:46,788 --> 00:50:50,268
My favorite police.
I've missed you.

470
00:50:53,748 --> 00:50:57,627
- How are you?
- Good. What did you find?

471
00:50:57,747 --> 00:51:01,907
- I've just started.
- You've had the body several hours.

472
00:51:02,027 --> 00:51:06,066
You or me?
Which do you prefer?

473
00:51:12,985 --> 00:51:14,945
Here.

474
00:51:15,065 --> 00:51:17,025
Take this.

475
00:51:18,225 --> 00:51:22,104
You'll get used to it again.
So, which is it?

476
00:51:22,224 --> 00:51:25,024
You or me?

477
00:51:25,144 --> 00:51:28,583
If you've just started,
you don't have much yet.

478
00:51:28,703 --> 00:51:31,543
I have a pretty good theory.

479
00:51:39,862 --> 00:51:45,221
He bit his tongue.
Convulsions.

480
00:51:49,461 --> 00:51:54,020
Marks on his palms. Burns.

481
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,019
Blisters.

482
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:04,659
- He died of electric shock.
- Good.

483
00:52:39,494 --> 00:52:42,654
Ida! Police! Run! Ida!

484
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,614
Hey! Stop, you two!
Police!

485
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,730
- What do we do now?
- We need to get away from here.

486
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:14,570
Lay low for a bit.
Let's go to Malmo.

487
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:19,969
Hi.

488
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:22,929
Hi.

489
00:53:24,609 --> 00:53:27,649
- Hi, John. Welcome.
- Thanks.

490
00:53:27,768 --> 00:53:31,248
- You can sit there.
- Okay. Hi.

491
00:53:32,368 --> 00:53:36,007
- Hi there.
- Jonas Mandrup. Who are you?

492
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:41,127
John Lundqvist. Technical Investigator
from Malmo. I'm going to help you a bit.

493
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,886
Are you? That sounds great.

494
00:53:45,006 --> 00:53:50,126
Make sure you get what you need.
Start with Richard Dahlqvist's phone.

495
00:53:52,845 --> 00:53:55,765
Patrik Dahlqvist died of
a strong electric shock.

496
00:53:55,885 --> 00:53:58,925
And it couldn't have been
a problem with the jacuzzi?

497
00:53:59,045 --> 00:54:03,204
That's not how he was found. The body
was placed like this after he died.

498
00:54:04,924 --> 00:54:07,484
Anything new on the girls?

499
00:54:07,604 --> 00:54:12,123
A couple colleagues found the place
they were living, but they got away.

500
00:54:12,243 --> 00:54:16,202
Okay. Maybe we should try to get
more Swedes over here to help us.

501
00:54:16,322 --> 00:54:19,282
We're trying to get on top of things.

502
00:54:19,402 --> 00:54:22,282
Saga, Henrik, take Richard's phone
to him in Malmo.

503
00:54:22,402 --> 00:54:27,681
Text Red October, asking to meet.
Put surveillance on him and go.

504
00:54:27,801 --> 00:54:33,440
- We're exposing him to danger.
- Not if we do it right.

505
00:54:55,758 --> 00:54:58,197
Where are the guards here?

506
00:55:14,275 --> 00:55:16,555
Where the hell is he?

507
00:55:16,675 --> 00:55:19,955
Come on, let's get back.
I'll call Linn.

508
00:55:25,034 --> 00:55:26,714
Saga.

509
00:55:26,834 --> 00:55:28,874
Saga?

510
00:55:47,871 --> 00:55:49,751
Saga.

511
00:55:50,711 --> 00:55:52,831
Saga, what's wrong?

512
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:57,870
Saga, are you okay?

513
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:02,149
Come on, Saga. Come on. Breathe.
Just breathe. Nice and easy.

514
00:56:02,269 --> 00:56:06,829
Just pull to the side.
Nice and easy.

515
00:56:25,946 --> 00:56:29,706
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. I don't know!

516
00:56:29,826 --> 00:56:31,986
I don't know.

517
00:56:52,863 --> 00:56:54,863
Thank you.

518
00:57:25,337 --> 00:57:30,336

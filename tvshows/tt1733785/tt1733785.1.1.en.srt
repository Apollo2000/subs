1
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,530
The lights went out.
The lights on the bridge went out.

2
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,166
- I'm on my way. It went black for...
-...45 seconds.

3
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,847
- I'll take a look.
- <i>No, I know what's going on now.</i>

4
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,121
THE BRIDGE

5
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,485
EPISODE 1

6
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,127
- Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
- Copenhagen Police.

7
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,045
- Do you know who she is?
- Yes.

8
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,884
Excuse me. A woman insists on
speaking to the person in charge.

9
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,049
- Is she in Sweden or Denmark?
- I don't know.

10
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,729
She's Swedish, and the car came
from Sweden. I assume I'm in charge.

11
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,842
- Saga Norén. Can I help you?
- When will you let traffic through?

12
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,244
- It might take up to two hours.
- I haven't got two hours!

13
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,449
- Back up.
- Is someone's life in danger?

14
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,683
There's a heart for my husband
in Copenhagen.

15
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,164
He needs a heart transplant.
Let us through.

16
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,120
He'll have to wait.
I can't let anyone through.

17
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,083
- What's happened?
- Is there no other way through?

18
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,245
There ought to be
another way through.

19
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,203
- No one's answering any questions.
- Let me pass, please.

20
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,565
<i>The Oresund Bridge to Denmark
is closed.</i>

21
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,247
<i>According to the police it will...</i>

22
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,921
- It's Stefan Lindberg.
- Hi, it's Veronika.

23
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,610
<i>- Sorry, did I wake you up?
- No, you didn't. How are you?</i>

24
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,527
I can't sleep.
I've got a stomach ache.

25
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,924
<i>- I see. How are the boys?
- They're asleep.</i>

26
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,244
<i>They don't understand
what's about to happen.</i>

27
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,531
- Can we meet up?
- Now?

28
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,402
Of course.
Do you want me to come over?

29
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,763
- No. I'd rather go to your place.
- <i>OK.</i>

30
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,686
- I can go to the office.
- <i>I'll see you there.</i>

31
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,290
Give me everything from
when the car came on to the bridge.

32
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,367
One camera records at a time.
They're started manually.

33
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,967
My colleague
might have recorded something.

34
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,250
Hello! Stop! Stop!

35
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,770
- Stop! Stop!
- I allowed it.

36
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,006
- Why? This is a crime scene.
- I'm fully aware of that.

37
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,164
- We've got enough bodies.
- He wasn't dying.

38
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,405
- Are you a doctor?
- No, I'm a police officer.

39
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,448
- What's your name?
- Martin Rohde.

40
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,207
- Rohde?
- R, O, H, D, E.

41
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,084
- Have you got an ID?
- It was an ambulance.

42
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,007
The Chairman
of Malmö City Council is dead.

43
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,371
- What evidence was destroyed?
- Probably none.

44
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,568
Thank you.

45
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,722
Hello. Hi. Finally.

46
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,523
I wont operate on Goran, Charlotte.
I had wine with my dinner.

47
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,081
- At what time? Are you drunk?
- No, but that doesn't matter.

48
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,365
You promised to see us through this.

49
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,844
- Morten Krag is a very good surgeon.
- Better than you?

50
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,482
I'll decide
who my husband's surgeon is!

51
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,522
- I wont forgive you if it goes wrong.
- What if I do it and it goes wrong?

52
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,761
Then I'll never forgive myself.

53
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,207
- We're done, you can move her.
- You can take her away.

54
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,688
Bloody hell.

55
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,648
<i>The autopsy on Kerstin Ekwall
is being performed.</i>

56
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,486
- And the recordings?
- They'll deliver them tomorrow.

57
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,689
<i>- What about the press?</i>
- They know.

58
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,084
The radio said that it was a woman.
They don't know who it is.

59
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,371
- And the family?
- <i>I'm on my way to see them.</i>

60
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,482
You'll wake them up, and there
are children there. Tread lightly.

61
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,841
In what sense? Oh. There aren't
that many ways to say it.

62
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,049
- Just tread lightly.
- <i>Listen, Hans...</i>

63
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,010
She was chopped in half.

64
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,449
- <i>Right above the hips.</i>
- What the hell are you saying?

65
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,768
She was due to attend a conference
in Copenhagen this morning.

66
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,204
- Have you got more computers?
- No.

67
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,921
Are you taking them?
The children's as well?

68
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,642
- When did you last talk to her?
- She called yesterday.

69
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,842
- Do you know what time it was?
- I don't know.

70
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,128
Around half past six in the evening.

71
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,489
- Was she threatened?
- By whom?

72
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,723
I didn't say that she was,
I asked you.

73
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:33,485
Not really. She was a politician,
there were some calls and emails.

74
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,443
- Has she upset anyone lately?
- Lately...

75
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,405
She wanted to charge for
library loans. Some disapproved.

76
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,483
- That's foolish.
- Sorry, what?

77
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:55,046
Reading becomes a money matter.
Social differences will grow.

78
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,886
- Is that why she was...?
- We don't know why.

79
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,010
It's unlikely
that library fees caused it.

80
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,007
Why? Why did someone do this?

81
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,770
Can you think of something personal?
Was she in debt? Did she use drugs?

82
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,844
Did she have an affair?

83
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,487
Saga Norén.

84
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,761
Can't we talk on the phone?

85
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,641
I'll be there in twenty minutes. Bye.

86
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,322
August?

87
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,683
- Were you on the bridge?
- Yes.

88
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,925
- What happened?
- A murder, the Swedes will handle it.

89
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,321
- Did you check on August?
- Yes.

90
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,007
- Is he asleep?
- Yes.

91
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,449
You promised to talk to him.
He's become a night owl.

92
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,683
Do you want me to
wake him up now?

93
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:53,210
- He got up at three o'clock today.
- I'll have a word with him tomorrow.

94
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,688
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

95
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,642
- Do you know the cause of death?
- I can make a qualified guess.

96
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,566
She died six to eight hours ago.

97
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,726
Yes, she called home at six thirty
and was dumped just after midnight.

98
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,603
There's something else.

99
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,331
- What?
- Take a look.

100
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:30,446
No livor mortis on the ears.
That's consistent with the bleeding.

101
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,444
Petechiae on the conjunctivas.

102
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,961
The face is swollen.

103
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,291
She was strangled
and cut in half after death.

104
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,481
And the other half?

105
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,967
The lower body is much paler.
A lot paler.

106
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,401
It's not coherent with the bleeding
or how the body was placed.

107
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,283
There's brown discoloration.
Frostbite?

108
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,968
It feels different. Frostbite.

109
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,010
Not frostbite, deep-freezing.

110
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,927
For about a year, I think.
I've never seen anything like this.

111
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,086
I don't know who they belong to.
They're not Kerstin Ekwall's legs.

112
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,407
- So everyone's here, then.
- Yes.

113
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,562
Hi, Sebastian.

114
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,841
I don't know what to do.

115
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,164
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I had to see you.

116
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,403
Can't you just pay the rent?

117
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:25,329
They can't evict the children.
Can they? Their friends are there.

118
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,689
I paid out money for the rent.

119
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,891
- Why did you bring the children?
- Soren wasn't there.

120
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,927
I can't manage.

121
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,567
- Can't you make an exception?
- No. You know I can't.

122
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,611
- Please.
- There are guidelines. I'm sorry.

123
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,411
Charlotte Soringer? I'm Frederik
Henriksen, hospital administrator.

124
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,931
- Goran had atrial fibrillation
- They managed to stop it.

125
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,244
- He's too weak for surgery.
- Too weak?

126
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,122
- But there's a new heart.
- It will be given to someone else.

127
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,491
Anders said
that you need a new CT scanner.

128
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,966
My husband's business is doing well.
He's willing to donate a CT scanner.

129
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,203
We're cancelling for his own sake.

130
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,651
He'll die without a new heart.
I want both parties to benefit.

131
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:54,365
Pass my offer on
to the proper authority, please.

132
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,730
<i>- Hello? Is this Martin Rohde?</i>
- Yes.

133
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,408
- <i>It's Saga Norén from the bridge.</i>
- Yes, I remember.

134
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:31,170
- Were you asleep?
- I tend to doze off around this time.

135
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,722
- There were two women.
- You found another one.

136
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,601
The lower body
belonged to someone else.

137
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,800
<i>- Have you found half a body?
- I don't know.</i>

138
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,922
It could be more than a year ago.
The legs have been deep-frozen.

139
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,722
- Can you look into it? Now?
- First thing tomorrow morning.

140
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,600
Can someone else
look into it straight away?

141
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,521
- I'll call you back.
- When?

142
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,651
- Do you have to get up'?
- Yes.

143
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,649
Missing woman, Caucasian,
at least a year ago...

144
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,451
- How old?
- Adult.

145
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,603
- And life in general is OK?
- Yes.

146
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,491
- What about you?
- I'm fine.

147
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,770
- So you'll be firing blanks.
- Was it in the staff news bulletin?

148
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,529
- Is everything working as it should?
- It will in time.

149
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,251
It can't be much fun.

150
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,167
- What do you mean?
- You've heard about castrated toms?

151
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,969
A wild predator turns into
a chunky sleepyhead. Just like that.

152
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,531
They're castrated,
that's not the same thing.

153
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,205
Let's see what we've got.

154
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,400
Two women killed a year apart.

155
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,407
One was deep-frozen.
They were dismembered.

156
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:55,045
And assembled on the bridge.
Someone wants to make a statement.

157
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,131
- Saga Norén.
- It's Martin.

158
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:12,128
The lower body is Monique Brammer,
I think. A missing 23-year-old.

159
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,363
- Can you email the info?
- <i>I'll be right over.</i>

160
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,445
- Why do you want to come here?
- <i>She's Danish.</i>

161
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,288
I was first on the scene.
Everyone's still asleep here.

162
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,762
<i>- Do you mind if I come over?</i>
- Yes.

163
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,403
Make sure I'm allowed in.
You've got my details.

164
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,928
Martin Rohde has probably identified
the second body. He's coming over.

165
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,608
- Is that a problem?
- Yes...

166
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,082
No, no.

167
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,043
If half of the body is Danish,
we have to cooperate.

168
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,124
I'll schedule a meeting
at half past five.

169
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,126
- Can you be ready by then?
- Yes.

170
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,447
It finally worked out.

171
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,401
- What did you just sign?
- Formalities.

172
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,044
- Whose is it?
- What?

173
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,567
The heart. Whose is it?

174
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,930
A man's. He's 25 or 26
and had a motorcycle accident.

175
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,810
- What's his name?
- I don't know. Does it matter?

176
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,485
No, I guess it doesn't.

177
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,724
- I'm scared.
- It will be fine.

178
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,850
Anders will operate, they're all
highly skilled. It will be fine.

179
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,566
I can't imagine life without you.

180
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,564
- I need to take Goran with me.
- Don't worry. You'll make it, honey.

181
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,606
- Hi.
- Hi.

182
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,969
- Hi! An early breakfast?
- No thank you.

183
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,604
- An email would have been faster.
- Yes, but not as pleasant.

184
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,649
- Where are you going?
- I'm coming in with you.

185
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:16,568
If it really is Monique Brammer,
we both have responsibilities.

186
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,446
Go straight on,
turn left, and register.

187
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:40,446
- Good morning. Coffee?
- No thanks, I've already had some.

188
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,925
I'm Martin Rohde.
I'll be working with Saga.

189
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,201
- Thank you. You need to register.
- I also need a card.

190
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,364
- My name's Felicia.
- Nice to meet you.

191
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,807
- That's it. This is for you.
- Thank you.

192
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,000
- And one of these is for you.
- Thanks! Ooh, Danish.

193
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,651
- See you later.
- I hope so.

194
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:28,082
- Where's Saga Norén?
- To the right. Bye!

195
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,600
Excuse me.

196
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,003
- Sit down.
- I'm afraid I can't.

197
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,086
- You make me nervous.
- OK, I can stand still.

198
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,371
- Why can't you sit down?
- My nether regions hurt.

199
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,564
- I had a vasectomy yesterday.
- Right.

200
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,042
I've got five children
with three different women.

201
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,445
- Have you got children?
- No, why would I want to?

202
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,889
- I've never heard anyone ask that.
- Many should have.

203
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,610
Not you,
I'm sure you're a wonderful dad.

204
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,331
- Why aren't you off sick?
- I can't afford it. August moved in.

205
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,489
Well, it's not really about money.
It was a small procedure, I can work.

206
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,087
- You can't sit down.
- I can.

207
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,529
- I drove here.
- Pretend that the chair is a car.

208
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,522
Yes.

209
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,969
- No one wanted to solve the case.
- What do you mean?

210
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,488
Monique Brammer
was reported missing.

211
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,602
Two prostitutes and a neighbour were
interviewed. The case was shelved.

212
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,211
It fell between two stools.

213
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,321
She disappeared, or she was killed.
They didn't find a body.

214
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,924
The case was
supposed to be shelved.

215
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,802
I'm surprised it took two weeks.
Come with me.

216
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,403
Do you think I should?
I tried painkillers, but...

217
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,683
- Two computers?
- They know who it is now.

218
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,889
- Will Saga handle the case, Hans?
- Yes.

219
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,601
- That's good.
- And a Danish police officer.

220
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,769
- Does he know that she's a bit odd?
- If not, he'll soon find out.

221
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,206
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

222
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,207
- This is Martin Rohde.
- It's Rohde.

223
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,400
Not as when you say "fur".
Rohde, Foure...

224
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,363
- Have you read the file'?
- Most people have just arrived.

225
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,650
Half of two female bodies were found.
One was Kerstin Ekwall.

226
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,770
The other one has been deep-frozen.
Martin?

227
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:11,211
It's probably the 23-year-old
Monique Brammer from Copenhagen.

228
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,082
A prostitute and an addict
that went missing 13 months ago.

229
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,651
Do you want me to repeat that?
A bit slower?

230
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,246
Monique Brammer, 23 years old.
A prostitute and an addict.

231
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,847
She went missing 13 months ago.

232
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,121
- Right.
- The investigation was inadequate.

233
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:46,407
- Don't you agree?
- Yes. It was terrible.

234
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,849
But we found blood traces
in her apartment.

235
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,404
The samples are on their way
and can be compared to the body.

236
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,327
Before the bodies were dumped,
the power was cut for 48 seconds.

237
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,405
Their trying to trace the signal.
Can you help them, Gry?

238
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,485
- How was it done?
- Someone accessed a computer.

239
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,962
Can you show me the fourth picture?

240
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,566
Use all the people you need. Gry?

241
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,090
Here's Ekwall's mobile number.
Get the phone records.

242
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,643
Check her computers.
Talk to John about passwords.

243
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,282
Anne?
Find out where she was abducted.

244
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,207
She left work half past six.
She had a car. Find it!

245
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,969
- Were they dumped from her car?
- No, a black Cadillac Escalade.

246
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:45,809
The image where the bridge
is seen from above.

247
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,251
- John can find the license number.
- What? Sure.

248
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,200
- What are you doing?
- I had an idea.

249
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,322
The orange line the body was on...
We discussed where she was.

250
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,723
Here's the Swedish-Danish border.

251
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,124
One half is in Sweden,
one is in Denmark.

252
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,569
- It's millimetre perfect.
- Tell me everything about the line.

253
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,087
Take paint samples.

254
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,361
Power cut, body halves, a politician.
We'll be in the public eye.

255
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,402
- Hi. Is Veronika at home?
- Yes.

256
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,962
- What do you want?
- I would like to talk to her.

257
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,921
- You can talk to me.
- I would if you were clean.

258
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,644
- What? I am clean.
- Hi, Veronika.

259
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,569
- Isn't it enough to have us evicted?
- The landlord did that.

260
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,208
- You're not helping.
- I'm trying. I'm trying really hard.

261
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,208
If you had been more dependable,
you wouldn't have to move.

262
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,923
- That was bloody stupid.
- Soren! Stop it!

263
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,322
What the hell?

264
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,444
Stop, you bastard!

265
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,487
Stop! Come out!

266
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,128
Soren! Stop it, Soren! Stop it!

267
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,807
- I hate that bloody bastard!
- Soren!

268
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,771
He's caused trouble all along.
It makes me so angry!

269
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,802
Let go of me.
Go to hell, you bloody idiots.

270
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,043
- How's the operation going?
- It hasn't started.

271
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,569
- Why? He was prepared hours ago.
- I don't know.

272
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,485
I'm afraid I have to go.

273
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:41,602
- Don't you know where he is?
- You probably know better than me.

274
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,369
We'll call you if we hear from him...
Let's go.

275
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,281
- I'm sorry about all of this.
- Stop apologizing for him.

276
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,888
He's an adult
and makes his own decisions.

277
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:08,400
Maybe you should do the same?
Soren put you in this position.

278
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,731
You spend your money wisely,
but can't if you're not given any.

279
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,366
You don't get the chance
to care for your boys.

280
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,650
- He hits you and the children.
- Hardly ever the children.

281
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,771
Hardly ever? That's not good enough.

282
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,124
He shouldn't hit any of you.

283
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:42,925
You can get your life back on track.
Just you and the children.

284
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,082
Leave your husband
or nothing will change.

285
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,401
Think about it.

286
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:15,165
- Anders? What's going on?
- We've got a problem.

287
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:21,043
The donor was declared brain dead,
and a nurse spoke to his father.

288
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,491
The father changed his mind.
We can't have the heart. Goran!

289
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,086
Wasn't that the turn-off?

290
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,922
- Stefan? Wasn't that the turn-off?
- No, not today.

291
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,530
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

292
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:43,006
Johan was nicknamed "The old bag".
He died a month ago.

293
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:50,486
No wife, no children, no debts,
no assets. The house was all he had.

294
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,524
It went to the local council.

295
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,522
It's Soren.

296
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,242
Come.

297
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,968
- Step inside.
- What about the children?

298
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,851
They can stay outside a while longer.

299
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:06,403
- Where are we? Why are we here?
- Just go inside.

300
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:23,843
- Crime scene and meeting place.
- Have you worked here a long time?

301
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,207
- More than ten years?
- Yes.

302
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,684
- Are you from around here?
- From Malmö? No.

303
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:37,724
I'm from Copenhagen.
I was born there.

304
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:47,646
No wonder Ingmar Bergman
and Lars Norén are from Sweden.

305
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,724
- Are you related to Lars Norén?
- No.

306
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,687
We need to find the meeting place
and the crime scene.

307
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,562
Where did the perpetrator
meet the victim?

308
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,207
I've spoken to Copenhagen.
You'll cooperate on the deaths.

309
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,362
Here's info about your authority.

310
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,162
I know what applies to me
in Denmark.

311
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,724
- Can I have a word with you, Saga?
- Yes.

312
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,286
<i>The report you filed
against Martin...</i>

313
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,966
<i>Yes, there's only one.</i>

314
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,011
<i>What do you suggest I do with it?</i>

315
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,006
<i>Don't you think
it will affect your cooperation?</i>

316
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,442
<i>- Do you think so?
- I think there's every chance.</i>

317
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,649
<i>- Will he dislike me?
- That might happen.</i>

318
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,887
<i>Because of my report?
It doesn't have to affect the case.</i>

319
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:16,045
<i>He let an ambulance through.
No life was in danger.</i>

320
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,091
<i>- I'm supposed to file a report.
- I’ll handle the report.</i>

321
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:26,725
- Yes, that's fine. Fine.
- I've got the car's license number.

322
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,123
It belongs to Daniel Farbé in Malmö.

323
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,762
- The journalist?
- Yes, he's a journalist.

324
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:46,691
- Do you know who he is?
- Yes. I read his column.

325
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,841
It's entertaining.

326
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:51,449
- You made me jump.
- I worked all night.

327
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:56,367
- I'm done for the week. Berlin next.
- You work all night.

328
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,967
Then you get down in Berlin.
How do you manage?

329
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,648
Get down?
How many children have you got?

330
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,327
Children that suck the life
out of you.

331
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:15,090
I haven't got children. No one says
"get down" any more. No one.

332
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,246
- Have fun.
- I will.

333
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,085
I downloaded
"Elephants in the Desert".

334
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,367
What do you want, Ake?

335
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,764
A hug, an award, an applause?
Would you like one?

336
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,728
- They're really cool. I like them.
- Yes, they were cool.

337
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,444
What?
Two weeks ago you really liked them.

338
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,807
And now you like them.

339
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,088
My daughter...

340
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,571
- She danced all afternoon.
- Sorry, I have to answer.

341
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,088
We'll have to continue this later.

342
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,962
You and the boys will disappear.

343
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,567
Your paperwork
and your debts are gone.

344
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,522
You can make a fresh start.
Do you understand?

345
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:35,289
You can make a fresh start.
There's cash and a mobile here.

346
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,007
But you can never see or talk to
your husband again.

347
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,404
He's their dad.
I have to let them see him.

348
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,724
Why? Why do they have to?

349
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:01,681
To get another beating?
To be scared and broke?

350
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:07,927
Let him spend everything on drugs?
He'll ruin everything for you again.

351
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,170
People like him ruin things.

352
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,841
You don't know me.
Why are you doing this?

353
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,085
Because I can.

354
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,922
Bloody hell.

355
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,202
- Here's my car.
- Do you think it's him?

356
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:00,241
He kept a body in a freezer
and killed a politician.

357
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,610
- He wouldn't use his own car.
- Nice car.

358
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,800
- Are the Swedish police paid well?
- No, the same as in Denmark.

359
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,524
Don't jump to conclusions
about my wages based on my car.

360
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,686
Maybe it was a gift?
Maybe I inherited it or had savings?

361
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:25,767
I hope your professional conclusions
are more valid.

362
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,926
Read this.
It's Daniel Ferbe's latest column.

363
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:36,086
- The one that's a good writer?
- No, I said he's entertaining.

364
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,766
- Are you coming?
- Yes.

365
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,682
Hello? What's going on?

366
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:39,085
- Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.
- A Cadillac has a bomb in it.

367
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:43,245
Is it a black Escalade?
It's tied to a double homicide.

368
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:49,362
- Is the guy trying to kill himself?
- I don't think he was involved.

369
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,686
No, you're not going
anywhere near the place.

370
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,770
Help! Help!

371
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,330
- <i>Take it easy.</i>
- Please help me!

372
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,963
- Help me! Get me out!
- <i>Calm down.</i>

373
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,130
- Help me!
- <i>The windshield is wired in.</i>

374
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,080
<i>The side windows are
connected to the electrical system.</i>

375
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:56,804
<i>The glass seems OK,
but there are wires everywhere.</i>

376
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,365
We've got his contact details.

377
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,520
<i>- What's going on?</i>
- My mobile!

378
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:33,481
- Yes?
- <i>Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.</i>

379
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:39,124
I need to know whether you were
on the bridge last night.

380
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,523
- What?
- <i>Were you on the Oresund Bridge?</i>

381
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,969
I was working.
I was here all the time.

382
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,445
- <i>How will you get me out?</i>
- I don't know, that's not my job.

383
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,889
- Do you know Kerstin Ekwall?
- Who?

384
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,601
<i>Daniel? Did you do anything
apart from turn the key?</i>

385
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:07,130
No. Everything locked.
The countdown started.

386
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,443
- Hello?
- I'm talking to the bomb guy.

387
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,683
<i>Chairman of the City Council
Kerstin Ekwall.</i>

388
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:19,643
<i>- Have you written about her?</i>
- No, I don't know.

389
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:24,124
- Have you been tipped off about her?
- No! What is this?

390
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,931
Get me out! Please!

391
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,563
<i>Does anyone else
have a key to your car?</i>

392
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:37,329
- No, I don't know.
- <i>Can you reach it?</i>

393
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,007
I don't want to die. Please.

394
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:46,291
- I don't want it to end like this.
- Daniel? You need to talk to me.

395
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:56,604
It skipped a minute.
What the hell did you do?

396
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:03,766
It was three, now it's two.
It was three.

397
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:09,441
Come one, hurry up.

398
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,640
Where are you going?
Stay here! Please!

399
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:23,400
Please! Come back!
Where are you going?

400
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,010
<i>You need to talk to me.
Daniel? Daniel?</i>

401
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,881
Is it a big bomb?

402
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:54,282
- I think so.
- You're not religious, right?

403
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,125
You're an atheist?

404
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:03,367
<i>Everything will just stop. The body
won't have time to register pain.</i>

405
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:13,489
- Are you sure?
- <i>Don't look at the clock. Listen.</i>

406
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:19,249
<i>Do you know how come your car
was used to dump two bodies?</i>

407
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,203
- No.
- <i>Think about it. Focus.</i>

408
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:30,890
- Who did this to you?
- I've slagged so many people off.

409
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,764
<i>Daniel? Are you still there? Hello?</i>

410
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,242
It's clean.

411
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:29,482
<i>Sorry about the drama, it's hard
to make oneself heard today.</i>

412
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,769
<i>I assume I have your attention now.</i>

413
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:39,326
<i>Our part of the world would be
wonderful if we solved our problems.</i>

414
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,802
<i>I would like to
point out five in particular.</i>

415
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,445
<i>This is only a beginning. We've got
interesting times ahead of us.</i>

416
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,407

Margrethe Thormod.
Director of Immigration Services.

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,200
Hello! Get out!
Get out of here, I said!

Patrik Dahlqvist.

5
00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:24,234
I think we've found new houseguests.
A woman and son. They have it really bad.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,720
- Who do you want me to be?
- Her.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,440
Not Agnes.
She's not nice.

8
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:37,280
I'm pregnant.
But I've decided to get rid of it.

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,353
- Do I not have a say?
- Not legally.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,369
- You can sleep where you want.
- Do you have children?

11
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:48,907
- I did.
- Are they dead?

12
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,800
Margrethe Thormod was responsible
for your deportation.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,320
I didn't kill her.
She jumped into a black car.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,950
Surveillance lost him in traffic.

<i>Hello?</i>

16
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:05,040
Morgan Sonning? I know what you did.
We need to meet.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,640
- Love you.
- Love you too, Dad.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,160
- I need to set an example.
- But you know Dimitri.

What do you want?

23
00:01:49,295 --> 00:01:52,640
- I saw your car.
- Uh-huh.

24
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,120
When you picked her up.

25
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,480
- Picked up who?
- Margrethe Thormod.

26
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:04,440
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Outside of the club.

27
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,360
Sorry.

28
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,715
I want money, or else
I'm telling the police everything.

29
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:13,880
- Say what you want. I'm going now.
- No!

30
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:17,757
You're not.

THE BRIDGE IV

32
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,400
- Did he say where he was going?
- No.

33
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:37,480
- What did he do here?
- He borrowed my laptop.

34
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,970
He wanted to check something
on the internet.

35
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:55,560
PC 14921.

36
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,872
Black Audi owned by Morgan Sonning.
He lives here in Copenhagen.

37
00:03:59,952 --> 00:04:02,644
I knew he knew something
about that car.

38
00:04:02,724 --> 00:04:05,800
No, he's not home.
He drove off about an hour ago.

39
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,200
Did he say where he was going?

40
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,000
A black Audi with plate number
PC 14921.

41
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:15,640
- Is that your husband's?
- Yes.

42
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,800
Do you know if he used it
on the afternoon of the 28th?

43
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:21,840
Why are you coming in a taxi?
Did something happen?

44
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,840
- We'll talk about it later. Can you pay?
- Morgan Sonning?

45
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:29,451
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
This is my colleague, Henrik Sabroe.

46
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:33,800
- Why don't you have the car?
- We need to talk to you about the 28th.

47
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,858
I was robbed.
Can I get money to pay the taxi?

48
00:04:36,938 --> 00:04:40,040
- Did you hear what I said?
- Can you wait a second?

49
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm okay, but can you go in
and get money to pay the taxi, please?

50
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,680
Yeah, of course.

51
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,285
- We want to talk to you about the 28th.
- Yeah, I heard that.

52
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,360
Can we talk at your place?

53
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,925
You want us to take you
to the police station?

54
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,760
- Why didn't you call the police?
- What would you have done?

55
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,520
Send a car out there?

56
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,000
Probably not.
It wasn't a high priority.

57
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:14,640
- I was just a bit curious.
- You were curious?

58
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:19,440
- So it was him?
- Yes, it was him.

59
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,080
He thought he'd seen my car
pick up Margrethe outside of a club.

60
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:29,280
I didn't understand what he was
talking about, and was about to leave.

61
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,446
Then he took out a gun and took my car,
my wallet, and my phone.

62
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,800
- Where was your car on the 28th?
- In the shop.

63
00:05:41,086 --> 00:05:43,680
- Where's that?
- In Sweden.

64
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,040
- You brought your car to Sweden for work?
- Yeah, it's my brother's shop.

65
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,120
I try to support him a bit.

66
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,760
- Where were you?
- The 28th? In Hamburg with my wife.

67
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,520
When he called, he said, "I know what
you did." Did you know what he meant?

68
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:04,809
- I don't know. I was just curious.
- And we couldn't talk about it at home?

69
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:09,440
My wife would have thought I did something
I wanted to keep secret.

70
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,480
- We think so, too.
- Okay.

71
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,950
But that's your problem, isn't it?

72
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,800
<i>Leave your name and number
and I'll call you back. Bye.</i>

73
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:25,760
Sarah, where the hell are you?
You should have been looking after her.

74
00:06:26,706 --> 00:06:28,560
Where are you?

75
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:39,360
Everything looked good
until this happened.

76
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,120
- What happened?
- I don't know.

77
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:47,280
She was getting better.
Sarah called and said she was better.

78
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,440
- Is she rejecting the kidney?
- It doesn't seem like it.

79
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,800
But we don't know what happened.
As soon as we know, we'll tell you.

82
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:47,760
- William! Where is she?
- Where the fuck have you been?

83
00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:51,522
- Where is she?
- You should have taken care of her!

84
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:55,070
I tried. There was a crazy guy.
A clown.

85
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,613
- Where is Leonora?
- She's been poisoned.

86
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:05,400
Tell them that.
Tell them she was poisoned.

87
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,920
They need to find it and help her.
Do you hear what I'm saying?

88
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:09,800
William, I have two daughters myself.

89
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:35,160
- How long have you been up?
- A little bit.

90
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:39,160
- I don't like waking up alone.
- I just came out here.

91
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:44,462
- Where is he?
- Working. He left a note.

92
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,200
"Good morning. Food's in the fridge.
Just take what you want. See you tonight.

93
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,080
Hugs."

94
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:55,680
He's cute.

95
00:09:58,658 --> 00:10:02,680
- Are we going to stay?
- Who are the only ones we can trust?

96
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,061
- Ourselves.
- Exactly.

97
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:12,400
If someone calls you up saying
"I know what you did" -

98
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:16,560
and you choose to meet that person,
it's because you have something to hide.

99
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,153
That he's hiding something
doesn't mean it's illegal.

100
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:25,080
- Maybe he's fucking around.
- Jonas' explanation for everything.

101
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,280
It's estimated that a fourth of Sweden's
population has been unfaithful.

102
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,760
- In Denmark, the numbers are higher.
- The world's happiest people.

103
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,840
That doesn't follow. You can't connect
unfaithfulness with happiness statistics.

104
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,378
Sure I can.

105
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:45,280
Morgan Sonning's car was near The Cave
on the 28th. The times match.

106
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,920
Unfortunately, tinted windows.
There's an APB out on it.

107
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,120
Since Taariq has Swedish credit cards now,
the Swedes were informed.

108
00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:53,676
Good.

109
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,431
Yeah, okay.
I'll check Morgan Sonning's alibi.

110
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:02,160
- We'll take the shop in Sweden.
- Okay.

111
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,800
My brother's car came on the 26th.
He got it that Monday.

112
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,760
It was seen in Copenhagen
on the afternoon of the 28th.

113
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,320
No, it wasn't.

Surveillance footage
from Copenhagen on the 28th.

I don't know what to tell you.

116
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:54,640
- How many employees do you have?
- Three.

117
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,960
But the keys are locked inside.
Only I have the code.

118
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,640
- And where were you on the 28th?
- Here, as far as I know.

119
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:10,120
No, I wasn't.
We were at the hospital with our son.

120
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:16,600
- The cars out there, are they ready?
- Some of them.

121
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,960
- Was your brother's car there the 28th?
- Probably.

122
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,599
- Probably? Was it there or not?
- It was ready. So yeah, it was there.

123
00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:45,400
- Hi. May I see your driver's license?
- Yes.

124
00:12:49,997 --> 00:12:51,436
Thanks.

125
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:58,447
- Is it your car?
- Yes.

126
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:11,694
- 911?
- S. 911S.

127
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:14,600
- Late '70s?
- '77.

128
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,480
A car was taken from here
and driven to Copenhagen on the 28th.

129
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,120
Is it only Tobias Johansson
who has access to the keys?

130
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:25,012
Does he not trust you?

131
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,760
- You'd have to talk to him about that.
- So no one else could have taken the car.

132
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:32,520
No one else. Only Tobias.
Do you want to sell it?

133
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:34,920
No, I don't.

134
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,760
- What did you pay for it?
- Nothing. I won it.

135
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,920
- You won it? How?
- On a bet.

136
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,440
Someone bet this car?

137
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,120
David Leander.
He was in my class at the police academy.

138
00:13:53,403 --> 00:13:56,440
- What did you bet on?
- He said I wouldn't graduate.

139
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,560
I said I'd be the best in the class.

140
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,360
Damn is that stupid, man.
How did things turn out for him?

141
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,144
He's the Police Chief in Stockholm.

142
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:12,275
It's Lillian.

You let me go.
They'll kill me if I'm sent back.

148
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:20,229
You need to help me again.

149
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:25,080
Taariq, you need to let her go.
Then we'll help you.

00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,360
We can look into that, Taariq.
That's no problem.

152
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,640
- Is that true?
- You don't need to go back to Denmark.

153
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,280
- Is that true?
- Yes.

154
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,320
Not you, her.
Can I stay here?

155
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:43,516
I won't be sent home?

156
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:47,670
No, you can absolutely stay here.

157
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:50,808
- You're lying.
- No, it's true.

158
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:53,959
- You're lying!
- Taariq, it's true.

159
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:56,586
Tell me the truth.

160
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,200
I'll shoot her!
Tell me the truth!

161
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,823
I'll shoot her!

162
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:11,893
Sweden has an extradition agreement
with Denmark.

163
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:17,520
Robbery, possession of arms, and extortion
will get at least five years in prison.

164
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,602
What happens after that?

165
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,840
After prison, you'll be deported.

166
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,240
Taariq, no.
No, no. Taariq!

167
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,748
No!

168
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:31,969
We shouldn't have let him go.

169
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,440
He never understood we fleeced him.
It wasn't our fault.

170
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,078
I know. Knowing he'd be deported
made him kill himself. We couldn't...

171
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:44,097
But I let him go. We gave him hope,
and then we crushed him.

172
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:49,332
That we let him go didn't mean anything.
He would have killed himself in jail.

173
00:17:49,412 --> 00:17:53,720
- Listen to Saga. It wasn't your fault.
- I feel guilty as hell.

174
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,440
It's counter-productive.
We couldn't have done anything.

175
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,038
To hell with that whole system.

176
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,800
A young, frustrated man.
Different values...

177
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,960
- I know who hit me.
- You saw that it was Christoffer?

178
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,941
- No, but who else could it have been?
- Someone else.

179
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:20,320
So it's random that this happened
exactly when they moved in?

180
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,880
- Your son wanted the house.
- This isn't about that.

181
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:32,160
But yes! He should have moved in.
He would have respected the rules.

182
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,960
How do you know that
Sofie and Christoffer don't?

183
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,714
You're not going to throw them out.

184
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:44,855
No. What you're suggesting
makes me want to throw you out.

185
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:54,720
Hey.

186
00:19:03,388 --> 00:19:07,200
- Is there anything to what he said?
- That depends on what he said.

187
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,938
There has been more trouble here
since they came.

188
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:14,684
Because people like Theo
are making them into troublemakers.

189
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:20,400
I think you need to remind them
what's expected to be welcome here.

190
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
Okay.

191
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:25,135
A little tea?

192
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,510
How are you doing?

193
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,360
I've been better.

194
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:44,040
Yeah, I can imagine.
It was a mistake letting him go.

195
00:19:44,738 --> 00:19:47,678
But we just do what we're told, right?

196
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,040
Come on.
She's waiting.

197
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:55,320
- Okay.
- Good.

198
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,200
The shop where the car was,
what do we know about it?

199
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,360
Three employees, but only the owner
has access to the keys.

200
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,680
Yeah, but if you work at a garage,
you can hotwire a car, right?

201
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,080
Check the workers. Why steal a car
in Sweden to kidnap someone in Copenhagen?

202
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,200
- Maybe the car means something.
- Or its owner.

203
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,880
What do we know about Sonning?

204
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Morgan Sonning, 38, born Johansson
in Torsby in Värmland.

205
00:20:25,518 --> 00:20:30,960
Married to Malene Sonning since 2014,
no children, no criminal record.

206
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,486
Malene Sonning, 55,
born and grew up in Copenhagen.

Works in PR. Started the Danish branch
of the 1.6-Million Club in 2012.

What does that mean?

medical research for women.

210

Margrethe Thormod was a member.

211
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,800
- Are you sure?
- It was in her file.

212
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,915
So they knew each other.

213
00:20:57,814 --> 00:20:59,245
Hey.

214
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:01,316
Welcome.

215
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:07,280
Hey, Bro.

216
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,000
- Look.
- Thanks. We just had to come.

217
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,596
So someone stole your car that night.

218
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,800
- And my phone and my wallet.
- What a pain.

219
00:21:32,054 --> 00:21:35,122
- Where did you go?
- Just out.

220
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:42,400
- So why were the police interested?
- Someone said they saw the car.

221
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,800
- Saw it doing what?
- I don't know.

222
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,640
- But the car was at your place, right?
- Yeah, but...

223
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:52,800
- What?
- The keys were locked inside.

224
00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:58,480
But if it was taken with
the extra keys... You had them.

225
00:22:03,827 --> 00:22:06,480
Didn't you know that woman who died?

226
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,360
That woman who was stoned.
You knew her.

227
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:15,376
Yeah, we were in the same group.
I knew who she was, but that's it.

228
00:22:15,456 --> 00:22:18,600
She tried to take your place
as Chairman, didn't she?

229
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,160
- Where'd you get that from?
- From Tobias, I think.

230
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,967
I assume he got it from Morgan.

231
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,194
- Hungry, huh?
- Yeah.

232
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,577
He just hangs there constantly.

233
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,800
And Tobias never gets permission
to play with them anymore.

234
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,920
I was actually doubting
whether I could breastfeed.

235
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,050
Because of the silicon.

236
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,520
- But it's going really well.
- That's nice.

237
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,480
That ought to be enough now.
Would you mind taking him?

238
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:58,160
- Here we are.
- He's so cute. Hi, sweetie.

239
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:01,680
Hey, you.
You have such nice eyes.

240
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:07,600
- Such nice eyes.
- Thanks.

241
00:23:07,832 --> 00:23:10,680
Can I take him again? Thanks.

242
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,945
Oh, sweetie.

243
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,158
There.

244
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:36,457
You need to wake up now.

245
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,520
You're all I have.
You know that.

Hold on...

00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,815
What Leonora got kills in four hours.
You need to help identify it.

250
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,360
- How do you know all this?
- A message from whoever poisoned her.

251
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,133
Find out what she was given
because it will save her.

252
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:10,440
- Drive.
- Shouldn't we watch?

253
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,440
- We get the antidote if we pay.
- But that doesn't mean...

254
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,317
No, we pay and get the antidote
to save Leonora.

255
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,520
Then we find that fucker.

Niels. What are you doing?

257
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:41,360
- I'm cleaning up Margrethe's things.

Yes, thanks a lot. Bye.

265
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,418
Okay, there's a whole lot
that doesn't add up with Sonning.

- What?
- A whole lot.

- Does anyone want to talk to him with me?
- I'll have to pass.

Okay. Well, then... Hmm?

269
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,136
Smalltalk or no?

270
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,880
What did you say?

271
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,760
Martin thought that colleagues
should engage in smalltalk.

272
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,470
Hanne didn't want to.
Which do you prefer?

273
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,240
Well, Martin has 7-8 years
left in prison -

00:27:05,578 --> 00:27:10,040
and Hanne's missing a leg,
but she's working, doing well.

275

But no, no smalltalk.

276
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:18,160
You can't link Martin and Hanne's situations
with their preference for smalltalk.

277
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:20,819
No, but it's dumb to take the risk, eh?

- Yes.

You didn't use any credit cards

You've been thorough, so you know
that we left them here at home.

00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,480
Things you don't talk
to your mother about.

303
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,600
No one. I don't talk to her much, either.

304
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,920
- Why not?
- She's so fucking weak.

305
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,600
Sometimes you need to open up
so you don't break.

306
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,480
She keeps a lot of shit from you.

307
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,640
She literally took punches.

308
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,720
Rule number one.

309
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,440
- All weapons are loaded.
- Good. And?

310
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,480
Never aim at anything.

311
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,760
- If you don't...
- If you don't want to shoot it.

312
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,640
Keep the finger off the trigger -

313
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,120
until you're sure you can hit
what you're aiming at.

314
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,320
Good. Try it.

315
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,200
Focus. Take a deep breath.

316
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,360
While you slowly breathe out,
gently pull the trigger.

317
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,520
Well done!

318
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,760
- How did you know that about my mother?
- She told me.

319
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,960
- At work.
- What do you do for work?

320
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,320
Leadership building courses.

321
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,320
I go around talking to people
who need someone to talk to.

322
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,160
Not everyone has that,
but everyone needs it.

323
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,600
You can talk to me.
About whatever, whenever.

324
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,240
Okay.

325
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,120
- William, they're not coming.
- We wait.

326
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,200
They're coming.

327
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,360
It's been almost four hours.

328
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,160
Isn't it better if we go back
to Leonora so you can be there...

329
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,920
Shut it.

330
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,680
Just shut up!

331
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,400
Quiet.

332
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,960
Hi.

333
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,240
We've found no poison. We found
traces of opioids in Leonora's blood.

334
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,160
- What is that?
- A strong tranquilizer.

335
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,080
It would explain her difficulty breathing
and her heart rhythm.

336
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,440
- She wasn't poisoned?
- No, not really.

337
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:10,840
Her condition hasn't worsened
like it would if she were poisoned.

338
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,400
We've given her naloxone,
and it seems to be helping.

339
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,000
- I'd say she's out of danger now.
- Excuse me.

340
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,320
William!

341
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,840
- We got it. The antidote.
- She wasn't poisoned.

342
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,080
Leonora. Come on.

343
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,320
- Leonora. Come on.
- Honey!

344
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,320
- Honey!
- What's happening?

345
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,200
- Leonora?
- What the hell did you do?

346
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,520
We need some help!

347
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,240
Is there a doctor here?

348
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,680
- Leonora!
- Get away.

349
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,080
Commencing CPR.

350
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,120
- What do we have here?
- Cardiac arrest.

351
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,960
- 6, 7, 8, 9...
- 160.

352
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,920
Release.

353
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,320
- Defibrillating.
- 1, 2, 3, 4...

354
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,040
Adrenaline.

355
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,760
Asystolic.

356
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,120
Come on... Please.

357
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,240
Who was the first person you kissed?

358
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,280
Her name was Matilda Friberg.

359
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,840
She was in the class above me.

360
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,120
Okay. My turn.
I choose truth, too.

361
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,440
Was it you who hit Theo?

362
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,800
- No.
- Okay.

363
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,160
It was Agnes.

364
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,360
Why did you do that?
Or why did she do it?

365
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,640
No more questions.
Your turn.

366
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,120
- Dare.
- Wimp.

367
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,360
Your parents left you.
You grew up with your uncle.

368
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,600
He was a magician.

369
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,080
But you were his slave,
and one day you had enough.

370
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,600
Did I kill him?

371
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,760
You ran off and joined the circus.

372
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,960
And one night you sold your soul
to be the world's best magician -

373
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,720
who could change reality.

374
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,680
Astrid, I don't know if...

375
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,320
Shh. It's not you.

376
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,880
It's fine.

377
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,160
It's not us.

378
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,560
How often do you think about
your little sister?

379
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,800
That depends.

380
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,920
- When did you think of her last?
- Yesterday.

381
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,920
Why?

382
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,040
Two sisters showed up
in the investigation.

383
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,400
They're older, and they were closer
than me and Jennifer -

384
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,360
but the older one really took care
of her little sister.

385
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,720
And you can recognize yourself in that?

386
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,280
No, she's a lot better at it
than I was.

387
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,200
Your mother, was she diagnosed
with Münchhausen by proxy?

388
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,880
You changed the subject.

389
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
- Did I?
- Yes.

390
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,040
Was she diagnosed?

391
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,880
No.

392
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,120
But you sent them to prison.
Both her and your father.

393
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,360
Yes, I acted on the information
I had at that time -

394
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,360
and was forced to get
Jennifer out of there.

395
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,480
- So you took care of your sister.
- Not well enough.

396
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,200
- What do you think of your mother now?
- I don't think about her.

397
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,080
Not at all?

398
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Never?

399
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,680
Sometimes I'm forced to.
I got some boxes from her estate.

400
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,400
What was in them?

401
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,240
Memories of Jennifer.

402
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,960
Everything was from,
or rather about her.

403
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,320
Nothing about you?

404
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,000
No, I was cut out from the pictures
where we were together.

405
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,920
- How did you feel?
- I don't know.

406
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,160
Try to put it into words.

407
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,080
Why?
Can't we just continue?

408
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,760
Try. It's important.

409
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,000
It...

410
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,320
It didn't feel good.

411
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,360
Good.

412
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,480
Hey.

413
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,760
- Did it go well?
- She wasn't as concrete this time.

414
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,600
Have you found out more
about the people from the shop?

415
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,880
Yeah. Moyo Mayers is a drug offender.
The others are clean.

416
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,840
There's no connection to
Thormod, Dahlqvist, or Sonning.

417
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,880
We got an initial report
from Forensics on Sonning's car.

418
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,800
A hair was found, and the DNA results
are coming tomorrow. Car wasn't hotwired.

419
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,240
What Henrik means is Thormod
knew the person who called.

420
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,760
Why?

421
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,640
Because she left Taariq
to get into an unknown car.

422
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,600
Maybe they said they were from the police
and someone she knew was in the hospital.

423
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,400
- Hospital police don't send out cars.
- You think people think about that?

424
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,713
If I call you and say something happened
to your husband, would you hesitate?

425
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,280
- Yes, because I'm not married.
- But if you were married.

426
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,240
- Would you think it was strange?
- Yes.

427
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,440
Okay, of course you would, but...

428
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:57,440
So we don't know if Margrethe knew
the person who called or picked her up.

429
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,000
No.

430
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,240
I don't think we'll get further tonight.

431
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,840
- Want to come home?
- Are you going to cook?

432
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,680
- Will the girls be there?
- I assume so.

433
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,280
I'll eat, and then we'll see.

434
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,760
- Wow. You look nice.
- Thanks.

435
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,000
- Are you going out?
- Yeah.

436
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,240
With a man?

437
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm going to eat with Lars Rasmussen
from the prosecutor's office.

438
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,000
- Are you together?
- No, it's the first time.

439
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,800
- You didn't meet anyone after Hans?
- No.

440
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,520
- It was almost two years ago.
- I know that, Saga.

441
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,120
But surely you have sex
with someone or something.

442
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,520
- See you tomorrow.
- Have a really nice evening.

443
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,160
Hello?

444
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,760
Girls?

445
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,040
What the hell?

446
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,640
No...

447
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,720
The necklaces.
They fucking took them.

448
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,480
They fucking took everything.

449
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,200
I'm hungry.
Are you going to cook anyway?

450
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,360
- Am I... Am I going to do what?
- Are you going to cook?

451
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,920
No, I don't think I'm going
to do that right now, okay?

452
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,200
I'm going. I need to be alone
to mull things over.

453
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,080
- Mull what over? Our child?
- The embryo? No, I've already decided.

454
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,400
I've decided to get rid of it.

455
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,560
You've decided?

456
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,640
So why did you even tell me
if you didn't want to keep the child?

457
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,840
- I thought you'd want to know
- Know what?

458
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,200
That it's something I'd really want
but can't have?

459
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,480
- Why do you want it?
- Because it's ours. It's a child.

460
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,840
Not yet.

461
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,640
You think it can replace your daughters,
just like with those girls.

462
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,200
You're dead wrong.
Just go, and I'll see you tomorrow.

463
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,120
Bye!

464
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,400
- Hi. You're here.
- Yeah, but I'm leaving.

465
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,920
I can't do this.

466
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,680
- But you are here.
- I'm sorry.

467
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,400
I need to go.

468
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,320
You're looking for them, but not us.

469
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,760
- It's been a while, eh?
- What's up?

470
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,320
See ya.

471
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:07,400
I, Hans Torgny Pettersson,
take you, Lillian Larsen -

472
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,600
to be my wife.

473
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,760
Lillian, I was unbelievably lucky
to have met you -

474
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,320
and that you chose to be mine.

475
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:29,480
It wasn't luck.
It was a miracle.

476
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,400
Everything is so much easier
when we're together.

477
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,200
You are my true love
and my best friend.

478
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,480
What do you want?

479
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,800
I've thought it over about the child.

480
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,040
- Okay.
- I don't want to have it.

481
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,960
But you do. So I think I'll give birth,
and then I'll give it to you.

482
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,800
You'll give it to me?

483
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,960
I'll sign away all rights and duties.

484
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:47,320
You'll have custody. I'll have nothing
else to do with it. What do you think?

485
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,680
What about you?

486
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,400
- Where are you in all this?
- Nowhere.

487
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,600
The child becomes yours, not mine.
And we can have sex sometimes.

488
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,640
Mull it over.

489
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,480
- I will.
- Good.

490
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,640
Saga...

491
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,000
Do you want to stay here?

492
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,040
I could really use your company.

493
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,120
[ Jacuzzi Murder Connected
to Stoning in Denmark ]

494
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,640
When you were out...
When you were robbed.

495
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,320
What were you really doing?

496
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,760
The alarm company called.
The alarm went off at work.

497
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,360
- What happened?
- Nothing, it seems.

498
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,800
It was just a false alarm.

499
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,800
Morgan...

500
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,160
- Did you notice the baby today?
- No, what about it?

501
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,120
It's too bad people don't have
more training in biology.

502
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,000
Then maybe your brother
might have wondered -

503
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,840
why their baby has brown eyes -

504
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,680
even though he and Nicole
both have blue eyes.

505
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,520
- And that doesn't make sense?
- No, sweetie. It doesn't.

506
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,000
Nicole was fucking around.

507
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,040
- Fuck.
- What a surprise, huh?

508
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,000
Good morning.

509
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,360
William Ramberg killed his daughter
in Malmo last night.

510
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,960
- What does he have to do with us?
- A hospital clown was involved.

511
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,440
- Is Ramberg here?
- Go question him at the hospital.

512
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,840
If you can.

513
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,960
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

514
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,280
Do Margrethe Thormod or Patrik Dahlqvist
mean anything to you?

515
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,360
William.
Have a look at these photos.

516
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,720
Do you recognize either of them?

517
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,560
- I killed her.
- We know that.

518
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,640
But do you recognize either of them?

519
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,520
I thought she was poisoned.

520
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,880
Why did you think that?

521
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,080
Patrik was a clown at the same hospital.

522
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,960
So maybe he was the real victim
and not his brother.

523
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,920
So we think there's a connection
between Margrethe, Patrik, and Leonora?

524
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,960
- A 12-year-old girl is unlikely.
- William is hard to hit.

525
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,520
So they get his daughter instead.

526
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:37,080
So a connection between
Margrethe, Patrik, and William.

527
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,600
- Is there one?
- We haven't found one yet.

528
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,120
- Hello, it's Henrik.
- Hey, it's Kevin.

529
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,200
- Sorry if I'm disturbing you.
- That's fine, Kevin. What's up?

530
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,120
You didn't come yesterday.
To the meeting.

531
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,120
It was a hard night,
but everything is okay.

532
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,560
You know you can always call
if you're having a hard time.

533
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,160
There's no danger.
I'll get through it.

534
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,040
- Nothing happened.
- You know that...

535
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,160
You're the only one who's really
right in the head here.

536
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,120
I missed you.

537
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:21,360
- Thanks for thinking about me.
- Yeah, of course.

538
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,280
I promise not to miss any more meetings.

539
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,240
- See ya.
- Yeah, see ya. Take care of yourself.

540
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,160
Bye.

541
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,640
Hey. I thought we'd go in the forest
so we could hunt for real.

542
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:34,200
Sure, but I don't know
if I want to kill an animal.

543
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:38,440
You don't need to.
You can just enjoy being out in nature.

544
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,920
Okay.

545
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,800
Christoffer?

546
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,840
Is that you, Frank?

547
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,440
Hi, Sofie.

548
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,360
- Sorry you had to wait.
- What did you find?

549
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,720
She was poisoned, as we know.
A fast-working neurotoxin.

550
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:06,360
Hundreds of different toxins.
All peptides.

551
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,760
Small proteins that block ion channels.

552
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,720
They stopped the nerve signals
to the muscles -

553
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:18,960
including the heart.
That's what she died of.

554
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,480
The poison Leonora died of
probably came from a cone snail.

555
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,720
- Where are they found?
- In coral reefs.

556
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,040
Or aquariums, or laboratories
where medicine is made from the poison.

557
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,640
Is anyone in our investigation
connected to the pharmaceutical industry?

558
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,680
- Not that we know of.
- The video?

559
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:51,600
Sent from a phone we can't trace.
But nothing reveals the person's identity.

560
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,520
- But there are some dead pixels.
- Which are?

561
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,720
It's exactly what it sounds like.
Look at this.

562
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,480
The small black squares are dead pixels.

563
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,080
- How does that help us?
- Not at all right now.

564
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,720
But if we find the camera,
it's like a fingerprint.

565
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,880
So that video made William
kill his daughter.

566
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,680
The two others killed the perpetrator
themselves.

567
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,360
Maybe they're not working together.
We just think that -

568
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:24,160
because Margrethe and Richard
had a connection to Red October.

569
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:29,280
If Patrik was the real victim,
then that connection doesn't matter.

570
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:34,680
So the victims aren't connected.
Three totally different methods.

571
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,840
- Could it be the same perpetrator?
- Stoning.

572
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,680
Electricity.

573
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,000
Poison.

574
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,920
All three are methods of execution
for the death penalty.

575
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,760
- How many different methods are there?
- Seven around the world.

576
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,520
Those on the board, shooting,
hanging, gas, and beheading.

577
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,040
So there's four left.

577
00:58:08,305 --> 00:59:08,651

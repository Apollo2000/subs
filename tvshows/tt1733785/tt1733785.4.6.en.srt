EPISODE 6

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,440
My name is Niels Thormod.
I'm a psychologist.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,720
- Will you tell me your names?
- We want to talk to Henrik.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,339
We saw the guy we took the phone from.
The murderer.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,000
- Can't you just go?
- Did you really think you could hide?

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,680
Leave my family alone.
Understand?

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,320
We're going to go home and get Mom.

8
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:37,320
We need to shift focus. The horse was
directed at Vibeke. Leonora, at William.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,040
I want to find that fucker
who killed Leonora.

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,680
The victims aren't the victims.
It's the ones closest to them who suffer.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,760
We need to find a connection between them.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,360
- Is it the baby?
- I had an abortion.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,480
Henrik.
I think I'm in love with you.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,920
You're not in love with me because
you can't love. Now get out.

16
00:01:07,163 --> 00:01:09,960
Lillian!
I think I've found the link.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,221
It's Tommy.
It's all about Tommy.

18
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:24,156
FIVE YEARS EARLIER

19
00:01:25,496 --> 00:01:27,034
Tommy!

20
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:32,880
Hey, hey.

21
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:37,360
Something came up.
Do you have a smoke?

22
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,600
What's up?

23
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:53,840
KG went into William's turf.
We're going there this afternoon.

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,720
- What's going to happen?
- He's pushing them out.

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,367
- When?
- We're meeting at their clubhouse at 4PM.

26
00:02:04,632 --> 00:02:07,813
How are you going to get them to leave?

27
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:11,028
- I just know that William's pissed.
- Is William going?

28
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:13,760
I couldn't ask him directly,
but I assume so.

29
00:02:14,354 --> 00:02:17,942
Okay. I'll talk to Lillian.

30
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:21,680
- You're coming?
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,400
I mean it.
I need to get out of this.

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,800
Tommy, you're going to get out.
I'm going to take care of it.

33
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,662
Okay.

34
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,000
KG is on the way into William's turf.
It could be violent.

35
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:43,321
It could also be nothing.

36
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:46,705
A business meeting.
Two men talking together.

37
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:49,800
- Tommy didn't mean that.
- He didn't know, either.

38
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,443
Is William going to be there at all?

39
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:56,880
If we show up, they might think
we have an informer there.

40
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:04,480
- We wait.
- Tommy's counting on us.

41
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,160
We need to be 100% sure.

42
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,400
Otherwise, months of work are wasted.

43
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,360
- Henrik promised Tommy we'd come.
- Then he's going to break that promise.

44
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,120
We wait to see what happens.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,265
Okay.

46
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:36,520
Hi, honey.

47
00:03:39,244 --> 00:03:42,600
- Is there going to be a party?
- Where have you been?

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,200
- You know I can't tell you.
- Or you don't want to.

49
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,800
I wasn't here, anyway.

50
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,400
- I miss you all the time.
- Yeah, sure.

51
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:58,960
- Put that on the gift table.
- But it's for you.

52
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:06,160
- You're really sucking up, huh?
- Exactly.

53
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,720
Is it working?

54
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,640
Because I saw it and thought
that you usually like it.

55
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:32,040
I want to say happy birthday to Brian.
We'll just go out so we don't bother you.

56
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,600
- You can just help, too.
- No, I can't.

57
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,440
There's way too many treats.
I can't keep my hands to myself.

58
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:42,360
- Where is he?
- He's in the bedroom.

59
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,084
Brian! Your dad is here.

60
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,708
Hi, Dad.

61
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,614
Hi, my boy.

62
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:59,760
Congrats. Put your jacket on.
We're going out.

63
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:05,000
When I turned 17, I wanted a motorcycle.
Dad gave me a chain lock.

64
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:08,077
My dad thought it was a good start.

65
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:11,880
Grandma's coming this afternoon.

66
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,440
- Are you staying?
- No, I have to take care of something.

67
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,920
But say hi for me.

68
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,996
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

69
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:37,640
Yeah, we're going to Manchester.
To a home game.

70
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,240
- Old Trafford. You and me.
- What? We are?

71
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:07,200
- No, thanks.
- Hello! Didn't you turn 17?

72
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:09,432
It's just a joint.

73
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:24,329
You can't say anything to Mom.

74
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:34,600
I know there's been all sorts of shit
these last years -

75
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:37,144
but it's going to be better now.

76
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,880
- What are you doing?
- Nothing you need to be mixed up in.

77
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,720
- Is it dangerous?
- No, of course not.

78
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:49,760
But it ends today.
Hey, Moyo!

79
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,152
What's up?

80
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,368
Not a bad birthday, eh?

81
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,480
Where the fuck are you?
It's about to go to hell here.

82
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,920
What's going on, man?

83
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,360
Shoot!

84
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,837
Shoot!

85
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:22,400
Hey, hey, hey. Easy now.

86
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,134
Henrik!

87
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,000
Why the fuck didn't you come?
You said you were coming.

88
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,000
Because the others wanted to wait.
I couldn't do anything.

89
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,880
- You fucking had them. They were there.
- I tried. The others didn't want to.

90
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,840
They wanted more information.
I couldn't do shit.

91
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:02,200
People died.

92
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,480
The guys that came out, they...

93
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,360
We shot them.

94
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:13,000
How many?

95
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,800
A lot.
There was blood everywhere.

96
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,392
Shit, man.

97
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:27,520
I'm done here.
I'm getting out now.

98
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,920
Okay, okay. Tommy,
you just need to stay a little longer.

99
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:35,760
Because we need to get William
and the people above him.

100
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:38,377
- You'll get money, a new identity.
- Fuck you.

101
00:10:38,457 --> 00:10:41,314
- We're going to take care of you.
- Fuck you.

102
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,575
Now we're just waiting
for them to retaliate.

103
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:54,520
I can't do this anymore.
I told him. They won't listen.

104
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,840
What would happen if you stopped?

105
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,120
Then the whole deal's off.
Then it's prison and all that shit.

106
00:11:02,477 --> 00:11:07,880
I can't do this anymore.
Can't you say I'm mentally unstable?

107
00:11:08,144 --> 00:11:10,720
That I can't continue if I'm sick?

108
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,160
I understand you're afraid, and
I understand you don't want to continue.

109
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,320
I understand you have regrets.
But I can't say that you can't do it.

110
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:24,811
I can make sure you get a prescription
for some sedatives.

111
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:30,862
Is it because the police pay for me
to be here? Are you afraid to lose money?

112
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:35,440
No, I just can't say you have a diagnosis.
It won't work.

113
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:38,960
- I thought you wanted to help me.
- Yeah, I'm trying to.

114
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:41,563
Go fuck yourself, you fucking fool.

115
00:12:08,355 --> 00:12:10,584
Tommy? Tommy?

116
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:13,400
Are you Richard?

117
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,400
- You wanted to talk about something.
- Yeah, I want to talk about something.

118
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:21,160
- I'm just going to start this here.
- Yeah, that's fine.

119
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,826
[ SIX DEAD IN GANG WAR
POLICE INFORMED BUT DIDN'T ACT. ]

120
00:12:30,906 --> 00:12:33,069
For fuck's sake.

121
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:37,400
- Can I do anything?
- Like what?

122
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,626
It wasn't your decision.

123
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:47,202
- You think that makes a difference?
- Yeah, it should.

124
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,520
- Yeah?
- Did you read it?

125
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,124
We need to bring Tommy in.
They're going to kill him.

126
00:12:56,204 --> 00:12:58,840
We know it was Tommy,
but the article didn't expose him.

127
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,291
It said, "The informant nervously
breaks the filter from his cigarette."

128
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:06,769
Tommy always does that.
He breaks the filter off.

129
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:11,838
Okay. We'll take him in. Go there.
I'll call for backup.

130
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:28,320
- This is Moyo.
- Yeah, it's me.

131
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,000
William wanted to meet.
I need to ask for your help.

132
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,660
You know the farm. There's a stop
at the end of the main road.

133
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,772
<i>Just to the left.</i>

134
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,992
<i>Wait there with the car.
I may need to leave in a hurry.</i>

135
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:48,320
Fuck, Tommy, what's this about?

136
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,200
Just wait there. I'll call you.
Can you be there in 15 minutes?

137
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,600
Okay.

138
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:59,733
Okay. I need to go now.

139
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:01,973
And Moyo? Thanks.

140
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,740
Looks cool.

141
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:09,028
It turned out really good.

142
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:12,973
Where are the others?

143
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:16,121
They're coming.
Sit down.

144
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:24,040
- Something to eat?
- No, thanks.

145
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,960
- What are we doing now?
- We need to find out who it is.

146
00:15:40,694 --> 00:15:44,360
And how much he told the police.

147
00:15:58,901 --> 00:15:59,960
So...

148
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,720
Everyone knows
what happens to an informer.

149
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:13,960
- I need to piss. Is there a...?
- Out in the hall.

150
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,903
No, no, no!

151
00:17:14,454 --> 00:17:16,415
Come on, for fuck's sake!

152
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:28,960
Are you done pissing?

153
00:18:33,683 --> 00:18:41,183
THE BRIDGE IV

154
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:47,663
NOW

155
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,611
We should have seen the connection.

156
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,378
Yeah.

157
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:57,197
- Who is Tommy?
- Lillian can explain.

158
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:04,986
Who is it?

159
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:11,280
Tommy Petersen. Criminal and informer.
Promised a reduced sentence.

160
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,826
He was caught, tortured, and murdered.

161
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:18,240
And Henrik was his contact.

162
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:33,699
I understand why you were criticized.

163
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,699
The case was investigated.
No one was to blame for what happened.

164
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:45,990
That doesn't mean you didn't
make mistakes. Six people died.

165
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,084
- Seven including Tommy.
- Hi, Henrik.

166
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:53,720
Let's concentrate on Tommy's family.
They have the strongest motive.

167
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:58,000
Nicole Johansson. The car is connected
to her husband's garage.

168
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,802
What's he doing there?

169
00:20:00,882 --> 00:20:04,760
That's Tommy and Nicole's son, Brian.
He's 21 and in a wheelchair.

170
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,160
Henrik, where are you going?

171
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:16,480
- Let's keep going.
- Solveig Petersen. We know her.

172
00:20:16,706 --> 00:20:18,854
Yes, what do we know about her?

173
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:23,400
Tommy's mother. She's still looking
to bring Tommy's killers to justice.

174
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:28,174
Most recently, at the Human Rights Court.

175
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,600
- And where is she located now?
- She lives in a camper. No phone.

176
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:37,489
We'll put out a bulletin on the camper.
What do we know about Brian Petersen?

177
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,400
Hi, Henrik.
What are you doing here?

178
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,080
What the fuck are you up to?
Your name isn't Kevin.

179
00:21:05,676 --> 00:21:08,600
You're pretending you're my friend.
Maybe you can walk, too?

180
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,440
Can you?
Can you walk?

181
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,680
- What are you doing? Stop it.
- Come on. Walk!

182
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:17,592
What the fuck are you doing?

183
00:21:18,969 --> 00:21:22,191
Okay, sorry.
Sorry. Here.

184
00:21:24,508 --> 00:21:26,738
- Come on.
- No, stop.

185
00:21:27,026 --> 00:21:30,281
Just go inside. I'm from the police.
Nothing happened.

186
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:34,104
Just go inside. Here.

187
00:21:34,763 --> 00:21:37,464
- It's okay.
- We're just talking.

188
00:21:37,544 --> 00:21:39,360
Your name isn't Kevin.

189
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:42,309
No, well...

190
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:48,240
I wanted to be anonymous at the meetings.
Not use my real name. Lots of people do.

191
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,840
What are you doing at those
NA meetings? Why do you come?

192
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,040
You know I'm trying not to do drugs!

193
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,618
Tommy? Tommy Petersen?

194
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:01,440
- What about him?
- Yeah, what about him?

195
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,480
- What does it have to do with my dad?
- Where were you on the 28th?

196
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,440
- Why?
- Because I'm asking.

197
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:19,600
I was home. I didn't do anything.
I played on the computer.

198
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,727
- Alone?
- Yeah.

199
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:28,727
- What about the night of the 29th?
- I was home then, too.

200
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:31,345
Alone.

201
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,421
Okay.

202
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,631
Henrik!

203
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,840
- What are we doing?
- We're going to chop wood.

204
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:48,309
Chop wood? Seriously?

205
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,520
- We need to help each other.
- But they don't like us.

206
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,680
- Not me, anyway.
- That's not true, Christoffer.

207
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,395
Theo wanted the house for his son,
then we came along.

208
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,265
It's our fault, you mean?
You take the blame for everything.

209
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,520
I want to go back to my old class.

210
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,480
- It won't work now that we live here.
- Then we can move back.

211
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,000
Now that Dan is...

212
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,560
Yeah, maybe.
Come on.

213
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,120
You don't think it was
the last break-in we'll have?

214
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,490
We have open doors. We trust each other.
That's how we do it.

215
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,440
If someone can't deal with that,
they shouldn't live here.

216
00:23:39,846 --> 00:23:42,840
It's not about whether we like them.

217
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,720
It's about our values and peace of mind.

218
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,680
We need to react
before the whole town goes to...

219
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,520
- We wanted to help.
- What?

220
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,920
- We wanted to help with the wood.
- Go ahead.

221
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,266
Hi.

222
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,680
He doesn't have an alibi for the 28th and
29th. Same for Patrik's killing.

223
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,324
- But he's in a wheelchair.
- Thanks, I know that.

224
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:12,956
- He has an alibi for the clown and horse.
- I'll double-check.

225
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:17,320
Three executions left. If the motive is
revenge for Tommy, you may be victims.

226
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:19,730
Are you sure he needs everyone?

227
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,760
We need to find the others
who betrayed Tommy.

228
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:26,840
Who's closest to you?
Family, siblings?

229
00:24:27,063 --> 00:24:31,240
Sex partner?
That guy from the Prosecution Service?

230
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,969
I don't know. There's actually no one
I'm that close to anymore.

231
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,647
- You love no one and no one loves you?
- Not that I can think of, no.

232
00:24:42,977 --> 00:24:44,720
You're the closest to Henrik.

233
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:49,494
- Maybe.
- Then you need a bodyguard.

234
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,040
- I don't want that.
- Yeah, but you need it.

235
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,360
Beheading and hanging I can take care of.
A bodyguard won't help if they shoot me.

236
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:03,598
But all precautions from now on.
Start by questioning Nicole.

237
00:25:03,678 --> 00:25:06,760
- I want to look into Kevin.
- You mean Brian.

238
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,840
- I want to see if what he said is true.
- But his name is Brian.

239
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,360
Okay.

240
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:24,465
But I've left that all behind me.
My old life with Tommy.

241
00:25:24,545 --> 00:25:28,680
- We just want to check some dates.
- You should talk to Solveig.

242
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,415
- Tommy's mother.
- Do you know where she's located?

243
00:25:31,495 --> 00:25:36,840
No, I don't want to know, either,
because she's a real bitch. Right?

244
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:41,440
- Yeah, she's real special.
- How was your and Tommy's relationship?

245
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,255
Well, he was totally hopeless.

246
00:25:45,013 --> 00:25:49,138
But you were always happy and carefree
when he was around.

247
00:25:50,205 --> 00:25:53,240
- If you know what I mean.
- No.

248
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,080
No, but it never would've
worked out anyway.

249
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,760
I think he was seeing someone else
at the end.

250
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,120
- Do you know her name?
- No, because I'm not sure.

251
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,889
I just need to go to the bathroom.

252
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,625
Would you like to hold him?

253
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,360
- How old is it?
- Almost seven months.

254
00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:24,512
It's so big.

255
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:32,182
Was she in pain, your wife?
Did she have abdominal cramps?

256
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,520
Did she give birth vaginally?

257
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah, she did, but...
I don't know.

258
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,896
- Who's the father?
- I am.

259
00:26:43,121 --> 00:26:46,480
- No, you're not.
- What the hell do you mean?

260
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,058
The baby has brown eyes, and you both
have blue. It's physically impossible.

261
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,320
That was stupid.

262
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:03,131
Yeah, they weren't too crazy about it.

263
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,545
But now we have someone
who fucked around in this case.

264
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,480
- Should I go back and say I'm sorry?
- No, I think it's too late.

265
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,880
Do you understand now
why I don't do smalltalk with you?

266
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:35,440
- What are you doing?
- Providing security.

267
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,153
- What nonsense.
- If it stops break-ins, is it stupid?

268
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,850
Does Harriet know you've started
your own little security service?

269
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,910
If she listened,
it wouldn't be necessary.

270
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,604
Go home.

271
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,778
Hey.

272
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,498
Hey.

273
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,941
I talked to Christoffer.

274
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,200
- More problems with Theo?
- No, absolutely not. But...

275
00:28:18,921 --> 00:28:21,605
He misses his old school.

276
00:28:22,395 --> 00:28:25,840
The commute is too far from here.

277
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,840
- To his old school?
- Yeah.

278
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:32,440
So we thought that maybe
we could move back.

279
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:34,179
To Malmo.

280
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,520
So Dan can find you?

281
00:28:40,155 --> 00:28:41,863
You're safe here.

282
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:47,664
Christoffer told me, Frank.
I know what happened.

283
00:28:49,935 --> 00:28:52,831
I'm so grateful.

284
00:28:54,162 --> 00:28:59,160
For everything you've done
to protect him and us.

285
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:09,160
Is this gratitude? You just leave
when you don't need me anymore.

286
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:11,440
He shot his father.

287
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,600
He'd be in prison
if it wasn't for me.

288
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,487
I made myself an accomplice
in a murder for your sake.

289
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:29,800
But he wants to go back to school, so you
just go. Is that fair after all I've done?

290
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:34,903
- No.
- No, it's not.

291
00:29:35,915 --> 00:29:39,160
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.
I'm sorry.

292
00:29:43,463 --> 00:29:47,520
I've done it before.
Helped people who shit all over me.

293
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,800
We're not shitting on you. Without you,
we'd never have managed.

294
00:29:53,044 --> 00:29:56,320
We'll stay.
Of course we'll stay.

295
00:29:57,374 --> 00:29:58,831
Good.

296
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:07,297
How did you betray Tommy?

297
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:12,725
The last time I saw him,
he was upset and scared.

298
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:15,560
He wanted out and asked for help.

299
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:19,840
- With what?
- Talking with you. The police.

300
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:23,920
Declaring him unfit.
Mentally ill.

301
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,400
I couldn't do it.

302
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,600
But I made sure sedatives
were prescribed.

303
00:30:32,241 --> 00:30:35,560
- Did he mention a lover?
- No.

304
00:30:35,796 --> 00:30:39,360
Other relatives besides his mother,
son, and wife?

305
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,280
No, not that I can remember.

306
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:47,320
If there's someone...

307
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:52,182
...getting revenge on the people
who betrayed Tommy...

308
00:30:55,139 --> 00:30:58,280
Does that mean it's my fault
that Margrethe was murdered?

309
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,622
Yes, she was an innocent victim
used to get at you.

310
00:31:07,056 --> 00:31:08,760
Yeah. Jonas Mandrup.

311
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,880
<i>This is Tobias Johansson.</i>

312
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,720
<i>I just wanted to say that...</i>

313
00:31:15,586 --> 00:31:20,947
My wife has the code to the key cabinet
at the garage.

314
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,160
She's borrowed cars before.

315
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:36,258
No, not you! Why did you go and
destroy everything, you ugly bitch?

316
00:31:36,338 --> 00:31:41,183
Hey! Take it easy.
I'll take this questioning.

317
00:31:42,643 --> 00:31:44,108
Sit down.

318
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:51,600
- I'm going to fucking report her.
- Yeah, you do that.

319
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,280
The Swedes like being reprimanded.
But we're not talking about that now.

320
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,640
We have evidence that you left
the hospital the night of the 28th.

321
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:03,280
From who?

322
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:06,947
From Tobias?

323
00:32:11,335 --> 00:32:13,442
Yeah, okay. That's right.

324
00:32:14,386 --> 00:32:16,640
I went home -

325
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:21,040
because it wasn't necessary
for us both to be there.

326
00:32:23,991 --> 00:32:26,880
That's the only alibi you have.

327
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,640
Do you know what you did this week?

328
00:32:30,454 --> 00:32:33,000
No, but that's why people
have a calendar, right?

329
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,560
I don't need a calendar.
I don't do anything. I'm only with Sonny.

330
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,720
I breastfeed, then he wakes up,
and then he shits -

331
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,440
and then I change diapers,
and then I clean up vomit.

332
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,600
It's nothing I need to
write in a calendar.

333
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,360
No. So you don't have an alibi?

334
00:32:54,364 --> 00:32:56,314
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm coming!

335
00:32:58,015 --> 00:32:59,609
It's you?

336
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,320
- You fucking destroyed everything!
- What's going on?

337
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,520
You can ask your husband about that.

338
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,280
- I checked Kevin's journal.
- His name is Brian.

339
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,680
- You know what I mean.
- Yes, but his name...

340
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,640
- Do you understand who I'm talking about?
- Yes.

341
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:40,511
Good. So stop.
He's wheelchair-bound.

342
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,345
He fell from a balcony. He was on drugs.
He couldn't commit those murders.

343
00:33:46,366 --> 00:33:49,108
And we checked all his accounts
and cell phones.

344
00:33:49,188 --> 00:33:52,800
Both Nicole's and Brian's.
Nothing stands out.

345
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,160
So what do we do with
white trash wife and her baby?

346
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,120
We keep her. No alibis,
access to the car, strong motive.

347
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,808
- Solveig Petersen?
- We haven't found her yet. Let's go.

348
00:34:04,888 --> 00:34:06,883
Henrik, Saga?

349
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,694
Come with me.

350
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:15,920
What the hell is with you two?

351
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,520
He's angry at me
because I had an abortion.

352
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,320
You were pregnant with Henrik's...?

353
00:34:23,622 --> 00:34:27,440
Yes. I had an abortion because
it would've come between us.

354
00:34:29,779 --> 00:34:32,840
- Can you work together?
- Yes.

355
00:34:36,197 --> 00:34:38,622
I need both of you for this.

356
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:43,880
So I expect you to act professionally
and keep your private lives outside.

357
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,840
Okay.

358
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:47,240
For your sake.

359
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:58,800
It's easy to be wise in retrospect,
but you could've handled it better.

360
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:03,480
Yes. I just tried to appreciate
what I have.

361
00:35:38,434 --> 00:35:39,784
Thanks.

362
00:35:40,962 --> 00:35:43,289
You can't blame yourself.

363
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:47,080
What should you have done?

364
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:52,120
- Should you have lied for Tommy?
- I could have done something.

365
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,000
He was desperate and what did I do?
I gave him some sedatives.

366
00:35:58,342 --> 00:36:01,600
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out to the girls.

367
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,612
But they don't want to talk to you.

368
00:36:03,692 --> 00:36:07,520
No, they need me.
I know I can help them.

369
00:36:08,343 --> 00:36:10,680
This time I'll do it right.

370
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,960
I know what you're thinking,
that this is just my job.

371
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,914
But it means something to me,
and I'd like to help you.

372
00:36:25,994 --> 00:36:29,440
I can make sure you have it better.
I can make sure you get out of here.

373
00:36:29,612 --> 00:36:33,560
- You just need to tell me your names.
- What do we get out of it?

374
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:38,840
We want to go to the movies.

375
00:36:39,222 --> 00:36:42,840
I'd like that too,
but this isn't a negotiation.

376
00:36:47,448 --> 00:36:52,320
Decide if you want to talk to me,
and ask the staff to contact me.

377
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,160
It's up to you now.
I'd like to help you.

378
00:37:09,805 --> 00:37:13,360
He's a bit like Henrik.
I think he's sweet.

379
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,520
Sweet people can be useful.

380
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:18,212
How?

381
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,080
If he thinks we trust him,
he'll trust us.

382
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,882
When we get the chance,
we take off.

383
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,063
Bye.

384
00:37:34,065 --> 00:37:37,440
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- It's Douglas. Can we meet?

385
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:41,321
<i>- Of course. When?</i>
- Just come.

386
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:46,240
<i>- What's this about?</i>
- It's best that we meet.

387
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:49,480
Okay. I'll try for tonight.

388
00:37:49,794 --> 00:37:52,088
Good. See you later. Bye.

389
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,480
You said you know how
to resolve the conflict with Henrik?

390
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,654
Yes. I'll find his daughters.

391
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:51,792
And you think that will
resolve something?

392
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:54,822
Then he can't be disappointed
and angry with me.

393
00:38:56,214 --> 00:39:00,351
- Why wouldn't he be?
- Then he'll have children. His own.

394
00:39:05,363 --> 00:39:07,400
Do you feel guilty about the abortion?

395
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,636
No, but I didn't know
Henrik would react the way he did.

396
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,080
If you had known that,
would you have handled it differently?

397
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:19,920
It wouldn't have made a difference.

398
00:39:20,294 --> 00:39:24,004
If Henrik had had the child,
we couldn't have been together.

399
00:39:24,084 --> 00:39:27,320
- But now you want to make it all better?
- Yes.

400
00:39:28,362 --> 00:39:30,960
- By finding his daughters.
- Yes.

401
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,280
Do you see the pattern?

402
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:45,880
I want you to think about it
for next time.

403
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,080
I'll walk you out.
I'm going out to another patient.

404
00:39:53,278 --> 00:39:56,560
Not everyone can come to me,
so I go to them.

405
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,570
What are you doing?

406
00:40:44,904 --> 00:40:48,640
I live here.
I can't live at Henrik's -

407
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,880
and it's not safe at the hotel,
so I live here.

408
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,440
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Goodnight.

409
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,600
Make a list of people you'd really miss.
They need to be protected.

410
00:41:02,146 --> 00:41:04,960
Okay. Thanks.

411
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,846
You're welcome.

412
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Goodnight.

413
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:50,640
- Can't you just turn it off?
- No, I can't.

414
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,520
- Seriously?
- Yeah. What do you want?

415
00:41:55,202 --> 00:41:58,440
Alice paid taxes on personal benefits
the year before she disappeared.

416
00:41:58,738 --> 00:42:02,120
- Yeah?
<i>- Something about wellness and health.</i>

417
00:42:02,415 --> 00:42:05,160
<i>- Do you know what it was?</i>
- No.

418
00:42:05,854 --> 00:42:09,080
Did she talk to a psychologist
or therapist at work?

419
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,679
I don't know.
She didn't tell me, anyway.

420
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,680
<i>- Hang up.</i>
- Who's that?

421
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,628
Her name's Tanja.

422
00:42:19,184 --> 00:42:21,584
- Are you having sex?
<i>- We are.</i>

423
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:23,840
<i>And we're going to continue now.</i>

424
00:42:28,327 --> 00:42:29,767
Come on.

425
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,738
It's Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
I contacted you about Alice Sabroe.

426
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,467
Yes, it's...

427
00:43:01,905 --> 00:43:03,541
11:56PM.

428
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,261
No, it can't wait until tomorrow.

429
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,560
I want to know about benefits
Alice used for health and wellness.

430
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,920
You didn't have therapists there.
Could she have talked to someone else?

431
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,099
Do you remember his name?

432
00:43:41,534 --> 00:43:44,520
What do you want?
I told you everything about Dan and Sofie.

433
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,960
This is about another case.
Alice Sabroe.

434
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,041
You were her coach
when you worked at Parsimonia.

435
00:43:52,425 --> 00:43:56,159
Yeah. It was a long time ago.
She disappeared.

436
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,935
You reacted to my colleague's surname.
Why didn't you ask about Alice?

437
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,080
I didn't know how much she told him,
and we have a confidentiality agreement.

438
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,030
- Did she come back?
- No, she was found murdered.

439
00:44:12,352 --> 00:44:15,177
That's terrible.
What about the children?

440
00:44:15,257 --> 00:44:18,160
- They haven't been found.
- I have a daughter myself.

441
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,690
Okay. Come with me.

442
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,629
- What did you usually talk about?
- Mostly about her home life.

443
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,040
About her husband, Henrik.

444
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,970
What did she say about him?

445
00:44:32,165 --> 00:44:37,080
That it wasn't going well. I suggested
couple's therapy. Alice didn't want to.

446
00:44:37,312 --> 00:44:39,028
Why not?

447
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,160
She'd met another man.

448
00:44:45,368 --> 00:44:48,640
- Did she mention his name?
- No, she didn't.

449
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,400
I think she was considering
leaving her husband.

450
00:44:55,065 --> 00:44:59,400
Could she have mentioned him, and
you forgot you wrote it down?

451
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,800
Yeah. I'll look at my notes
and see if I can find anything.

452
00:45:04,043 --> 00:45:07,240
Do that. And call me.

453
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,861
Okay.

454
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:23,820
Hi.

455
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,640
I'm happy you wanted
to see me again.

456
00:45:40,176 --> 00:45:43,430
I assume you don't trust adults.

457
00:45:48,652 --> 00:45:51,000
Is that something
you want to talk about?

458
00:45:53,326 --> 00:45:54,856
Our stepdad.

459
00:45:56,901 --> 00:45:58,716
We couldn't stay there.

460
00:45:59,296 --> 00:46:03,200
- Does he live here in Copenhagen?
- Jutland. We don't want to go back.

461
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,480
Do you want to explain
why you don't want to go back?

462
00:46:14,803 --> 00:46:16,920
He wasn't very nice.

463
00:46:21,357 --> 00:46:22,920
What's his name?

464
00:46:26,223 --> 00:46:27,825
My name is Julie.

465
00:46:29,082 --> 00:46:31,282
And this is my little sister, Ida.

466
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:33,991
Julie and Ida.

467
00:46:35,548 --> 00:46:36,998
That's really nice.

468
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,880
We got a match on Solveig's car.
She's on the way.

469
00:46:45,232 --> 00:46:50,540
Alice met a coach at work.
He wasn't an employee, but I found him...

470
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,760
Is this leading anywhere?

471
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,480
If she had someone else,
would you want to know?

472
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,360
- Did she?
- Yes, but the coach didn't know who.

473
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,360
- Are you sure?
- Not 100%.

474
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,960
If you don't have evidence,
then don't tell me that.

475
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:16,057
- Easy.
- Let me go!

476
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,600
- It's easier if you cooperate.
- Go with my colleague...

477
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,720
- Who's questioning her?
- You and me.

478
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,938
Lillian would really like us
to do it together.

479
00:47:29,946 --> 00:47:31,040
Good.

480
00:47:33,538 --> 00:47:35,388
Where were you on the 28th?

481
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:37,836
Figure it out yourselves.

482
00:47:39,005 --> 00:47:41,305
Write where you were on these dates.

483
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:49,013
Oh, now you want to talk to me, huh?

484
00:47:49,498 --> 00:47:53,760
When I wanted to contact you after
Tommy's death, I didn't feel very welcome.

485
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,800
- I didn't work on that case.
- No, but he did.

486
00:48:01,302 --> 00:48:03,280
You have a strong motive for revenge.

487
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,240
When society betrays you, you need to
take the law into your own hands.

488
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,870
Is that what you did?

489
00:48:09,452 --> 00:48:13,902
Not at all. I'm just happy
someone's avenging Tommy's death.

490
00:48:15,474 --> 00:48:18,728
The people that did it deserve it.

491
00:48:19,812 --> 00:48:22,960
We're going to keep you until
you give us what we need.

492
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,200
So we'll start again.
Where were you on the 28th?

493
00:49:01,174 --> 00:49:03,880
<i>- Saga, it's me. I found a letter.</i>
- Good.

494
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,694
<i>From Tommy to his mother. He mentions
a Steph. They had a relationship.</i>

495
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:13,096
How does it feel to know
that you're next?

496
00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:16,960
- Are you threatening me?
- No.

497
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,280
But with them out of the way
it'll be your turn soon.

498
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,840
- Tommy wrote letters to you.
- Did you mess with my things?

499
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,400
- We have a search warrant.
- It's my private property.

500
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,261
If you're suspected of a crime
punishable by imprisonment -

501
00:49:34,341 --> 00:49:39,680
a search must be undertaken
to look for evidence in the case.

502
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:44,000
Tommy mentioned a Steph in the letters.
Who is that?

503
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,840
Why should I tell you?

504
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,468
Steph, is that a man or a woman?

505
00:49:56,309 --> 00:50:00,760
- Steph? It's a man.
- It's a man?

506
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,280
No, wait a minute.
I think it's a woman.

507
00:50:04,995 --> 00:50:06,280
It's a woman?

508
00:50:07,009 --> 00:50:09,920
Was there anything else
I can help you with?

509
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,800
Why did you go?

510
00:50:14,368 --> 00:50:17,400
We decided that we would
act professional together.

511
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,330
Malene Sonning has a daughter
named Stephanie.

512
00:50:22,133 --> 00:50:26,560
Stephanie Balling, 33.
Daughter of Malene and Peder Balling.

513
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,320
Volunteered in Colombia,
but came home three months ago.

514
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,760
- Address?
- She hasn't registered an address.

515
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,200
That's all we have on her.

516
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,800
If it's Morgan you're after,
you'll have to talk to my divorce lawyer.

517
00:50:57,548 --> 00:51:00,600
We're here because of
your daughter, Stephanie.

518
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,163
- Stephanie?
- Do you know where she is?

519
00:51:03,243 --> 00:51:06,480
She's in Colombia.
Did something happen?

520
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,789
She came home three months ago.

521
00:51:12,647 --> 00:51:14,647
You didn't know she came home?

522
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:17,219
No, I didn't.

523
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:22,222
Do you know if she had a relationship
with Tommy Petersen four years ago?

524
00:51:23,197 --> 00:51:25,513
I didn't even know
she came home.

525
00:51:27,974 --> 00:51:30,920
Do you think she tells me
about her boyfriends?

526
00:51:31,264 --> 00:51:34,440
- Does she have keys to the house?
- Yeah.

527
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:44,943
You were the one who figured it out about
Morgan and Nicole and the baby, huh?

528
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:48,880
Yes, and I'm sorry for that.

529
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,515
You don't need to be.
It was good for me to know.

530
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:57,864
- Yeah, was there anything else?
- No. Thanks.

531
00:51:57,944 --> 00:51:59,197
Thanks.

532
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:15,714
Stephanie could've taken the extra key to
Morgan's car when they were in Hamburg.

533
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:21,440
- Why then?
- She needed a car. They didn't get along.

534
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,526
Her mail is being sent to Christiania.

535
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,600
We have surveillance there.
No news.

536
00:52:28,067 --> 00:52:29,360
Hello?

537
00:52:30,435 --> 00:52:31,480
Yeah.

538
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,664
Okay. I'm coming down.

539
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,417
Kevin.

540
00:52:40,889 --> 00:52:42,199
Hey.

541
00:52:43,518 --> 00:52:45,920
- Sorry if I'm disturbing.
- It's okay.

542
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:51,794
We're friends.
I mean, you mean something to me.

543
00:52:53,385 --> 00:52:57,520
Then you come and rip me out of my chair
and ask what I've done -

544
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,661
and talk about my dad...
What the fuck is going on?

545
00:53:02,435 --> 00:53:07,519
We think the killings we're investigating
are connected to your father.

546
00:53:08,775 --> 00:53:10,520
Why do you think that?

547
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,200
Do you know anything
about a Stephanie or a Steph?

548
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:17,492
- Someone in contact with your father.
- No.

549
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:22,295
- Did you ask Grandma?
- Yeah, we tried, but...

550
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,280
It was hopeless.

551
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,819
What about Moyo, my dad's friend?

552
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,560
- The guy who works in the shop in Malmo?
- Yeah.

553
00:53:34,246 --> 00:53:37,508
My mom helped him
get a job at Tobias' place.

554
00:53:38,177 --> 00:53:39,625
Okay.

555
00:53:40,324 --> 00:53:43,800
Thanks, my...
For coming here, too.

556
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,780
How are you doing really?

557
00:53:48,545 --> 00:53:51,783
- Did you fall off the wagon again?
- No.

558
00:53:55,737 --> 00:53:58,006
See you at the next meeting.

559
00:54:00,617 --> 00:54:03,080
Of course. See ya.

560
00:54:13,647 --> 00:54:15,920
What was your relationship to Tommy?

561
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,827
Me and Tommy were like brothers.
We had big plans.

562
00:54:20,622 --> 00:54:23,480
Then it all went to hell.
It was your fault.

563
00:54:25,147 --> 00:54:27,440
What did you do after Tommy's death?

564
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,629
Sandra and I moved to Sweden
to get away from it all.

565
00:54:30,709 --> 00:54:33,059
Then Nicole got me a job at the shop.

566
00:54:33,965 --> 00:54:38,529
- Are you almost finished with that?
- I haven't done anything.

567
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:44,320
It's fucking unreal that you all got off.
But I have Sandra, and I won't lose her.

568
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:50,160
Sandra, Sandra, and Sandra. Convenient.
Your wife is your only alibi.

569
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,640
- We're good together.
- Are you?

570
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,720
Then maybe I'll go talk to her
while you stay there.

571
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,466
Can you let me out?

572
00:55:34,428 --> 00:55:37,240
I dreamed about you a few nights ago.

573
00:55:37,772 --> 00:55:39,422
It was a long time ago.

574
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:44,690
And I was happy to see you.

575
00:55:45,352 --> 00:55:46,637
Astrid.

576
00:55:47,893 --> 00:55:50,040
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

577
00:55:50,399 --> 00:55:53,680
- Why are you speaking Danish?
- I wasn't.

578
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,960
I heard you.

579
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,220
It wasn't me.
It was Magdalena.

580
00:56:00,012 --> 00:56:03,520
- But you aren't dressed up.
- One doesn't always need to be.

581
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,640
[ Anna. Beloved daughter.
Beloved sister. ]

582
00:56:10,503 --> 00:56:12,360
Is that your sister?

583
00:56:16,281 --> 00:56:17,835
Don't tell anyone.

584
00:56:18,812 --> 00:56:21,163
Not to Frank or your mother.

585
00:56:21,696 --> 00:56:24,760
- Okay?
- Okay.

586
00:57:11,878 --> 00:57:13,040
Hello?

587
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,544
Sandra?

588
00:57:21,434 --> 00:57:23,191
I'm from the police.

589
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,880
Hello?

590
00:57:44,433 --> 00:57:45,654
Hello?

590
00:57:46,305 --> 00:58:46,603

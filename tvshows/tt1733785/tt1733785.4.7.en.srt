2
00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:08,040
It's Tommy.
It's all about Tommy.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,960
Where the hell are you?

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,720
Everyone knows what happens
to an informer.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,240
- Six people died because of you.
- Henrik was his contact.

6
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:28,120
- We have a match for Solveig's car.
- You have a strong motive for revenge.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,360
I'm glad someone's avenging
Tommy's death. They deserved it.

8
00:00:35,523 --> 00:00:39,640
Is this gratitude? You just leave
when you don't need me anymore.

9
00:00:40,465 --> 00:00:45,920
He shot his father.
He'd be in prison if it wasn't for me.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,800
We got this phone from you.
We just want to know who you took it from.

11
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,840
- It'll be good to get back to it.
- Only if you can handle it.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,920
- Can't you talk to me?
- We want to talk to Henrik.

EPISODE 7

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,120
- I thought I heard something.
- Christoffer won't answer his phone.

16
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:35,920
- Something must have happened.
- Maybe his battery just ran out.

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,160
Why didn't he call before, then?
Did he tell Astrid where he was going?

18
00:01:41,878 --> 00:01:46,520
He went into the city, met some friends,
lost track of time.

19
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,520
Tell him to touch base.

20
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:59,160
But he's 17.
Old enough to be out one night.

21
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:05,120
Christoffer!
What are you doing here so early?

22
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,000
- I'm borrowing Harriet's car.
- She never loans out her car.

23
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
- She did to me.
- Do you even have a license?

24
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:36,037
THE BRIDGE IV

25
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:47,120
- I didn't think you'd be here today.
- Why not?

26
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:49,600
Because Henrik was shot.

27
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,920
I don't think he wants me to visit.

28
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,120
Oh, okay.

29
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,640
What happened?

30
00:06:00,472 --> 00:06:02,520
You were like Siamese twins.

31
00:06:04,928 --> 00:06:07,084
Do you know how Henrik is?

32
00:06:07,803 --> 00:06:12,200
He got a bullet in the leg.
It's nothing serious.

33
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:19,080
They didn't mean for him to die.
You're the one that's going to die.

34
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,320
- Okay.
- Are you coming?

35
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:30,000
- Did she suffer?
- She was hanged.

36
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,199
She didn't break her neck.
She was strangled. It can take time.

37
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,729
But it's nothing we want to know about.

38
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:40,524
Do you know why she was attacked?

39
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:50,000
It's only people who betrayed Tommy.
You were his best friend.

40
00:06:57,177 --> 00:06:58,909
He called me.

41
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:02,000
Tommy called you?

42
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,360
He was going to meet with
William somewhere.

43
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,080
I was going to wait for him
if he needed to take off.

44
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,600
Does anyone know you betrayed Tommy?

45
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:20,302
I had such a shit conscience, so I...

46
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:23,720
...I told Tommy's mother
at the funeral.

47
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,680
- I hoped she would forgive me.
- Forgive? Solveig Petersen?

48
00:07:30,398 --> 00:07:34,560
- She said I deserved to burn in hell.
- Yeah, sounds like her.

49
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,960
Tommy had a lover.
Did you know?

50
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,822
Is that her?

51
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:46,280
I don't know.
I never met her.

52
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:51,348
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.

53
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,760
- Do you know Stephanie's last name?
- No, I never met her.

54
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,987
We just talked to Moyo.

55
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,320
He told you he didn't pick up Tommy
the day he was murdered.

56
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,860
Who did you tell? Stephanie?

57
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:42,641
You're a nut job, but you understand
how bad that looks, right?

58
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,710
Be a sweetie and shut the door behind you.

59
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,320
What the hell were you thinking
going to Ystad alone?

60
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:07,283
I wanted to check Moyo's alibi.
I had no other way to know.

61
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:12,360
It was dumb to go alone.
You acted impulsively, irresponsibly...

62
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:16,360
Yeah, it was dumb,
but it wasn't drugs.

63
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,840
I didn't start again.

64
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:29,240
Okay. Good. I'll get someone
to pick you up when you're ready.

65
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,920
Why do you feel that you murdered
Dan Brolund?

66
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:49,433
Doesn't she get it?
If I said anything, Frank said -

67
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:53,240
that he wouldn't
be able to help me anymore.

68
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,040
Frank?
Frank Wahlgren?

69
00:09:56,708 --> 00:10:00,080
Yes. He helped us.

70
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,000
But then he became
a fucking psycho -

71
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,960
talking about how ungrateful we were
because we didn't want to live with him.

72
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,280
- Is it only Frank who lives there?
- No. Astrid, too.

73
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:13,680
His daughter.

74
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:20,655
- Does Astrid have a sister?
- No, but I think she did.

75
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,567
I heard her talking Danish by a grave.

76
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:28,040
- Do you remember the name on the grave?
- Anna.

77
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:36,160
- Is that Astrid?
- Maybe.

78
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,435
- Look at the photo. Is that Astrid?
- Maybe. I'm not sure.

79
00:10:57,286 --> 00:11:01,520
- Oh. It's you.
- Lillian said you weren't at work.

80
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,480
- Exactly. I needed to sleep more.
- I need your help with something.

81
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:16,360
- Can you make her 8 years older?
- Yeah...

82
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,040
Hey there.

83
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,000
- You're here.
- Can't fool you.

84
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:27,403
- Are you sleeping together?
- What do you think?

85
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:32,480
- It looks like you're sleeping together.
- Then I guess we are.

86
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:39,561
- Can you make her 8 years older?
- Sure, but I don't have the things here.

87
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,920
Get dressed and we'll go.

88
00:11:46,714 --> 00:11:51,440
- Where have you been?
- John's apartment in Sweden.

89
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,080
I'm going crazy with that
lunatic Solveig.

90
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,760
She won't say who she told about Moyo.

91
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,520
She hasn't cooperated so far.
Why would she now?

92
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,570
What are you doing?

93
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:13,741
- I'm looking into Frank Wahlgren.
- Why?

94
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:18,160
- I want to know more about his daughters.
- Who the fuck is Frank Wahlgren?

95
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:22,320
Jonas, Saga. Niels Thormod showed up
in another investigation.

96
00:12:23,023 --> 00:12:25,680
Douglas Krabbe.
He was reported missing.

97
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,760
When we looked at his phone,
we found a lot of calls to you.

98
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,880
Okay. I hired him just after
Margrethe's murder.

99
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:40,360
- Why?
- He's a private detective.

100
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,600
I hoped he could find out
more than you could.

101
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,400
- Could he?
- He called...

102
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,280
- When?
- Night before last. He wanted to talk.

103
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,080
- Why?
- He wanted to meet.

104
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,520
- Where were you going to meet?
- Stop that, for fuck's sake.

105
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,480
I'm going to tell you everything.
Stop it.

106
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,320
At his office.
I went there the day after.

107
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:10,720
And he wasn't there.

108
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:14,872
Are you done?

109
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,680
Yes.

110
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,600
What did you do
when he wasn't there?

111
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,200
I tried to contact him.
He didn't pick up.

112
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:30,480
- Do you think something happened to him?
- We need the material he gave you. Now.

113
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:33,582
Of course.

114
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,960
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

115
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,680
Douglas Krabbe must have gotten
some of this from the police.

116
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,760
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

117
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,520
It's not just the press we're leaking to.

118
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,609
That's not good.

119
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:26,200
I'll call Forensics. From now on,
we'll consider this a crime scene.

120
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,360
Check Krabbe's computer and find
everything related to Margrethe Thormod.

121
00:14:36,768 --> 00:14:41,360
- How's it going with the photo?
- I did the best I could.

122
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:44,400
- Send it to me and to Linn.
- Okay.

123
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,080
- Is this Astrid?
- Yes.

124
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:14,115
Christoffer?

125
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,533
What the hell!

126
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,680
I know where Astrid is.
I'm positive.

127
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:49,305
You found her? Where?
Where is she?

128
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:54,680
At Frank Wahlgren's, the man we
questioned about Brolund's disappearance.

129
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,588
And Anna? Where is Anna?

130
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:03,600
According to the information I have,
she's dead.

131
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:09,326
- But Astrid's alive?
- Yes.

132
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:11,840
A team is on the way
if you want to come along.

133
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:26,763
Are you busy?
Trying to minimize the damage?

134
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:31,268
- I don't have time for you now, okay?
- Your little protégé stole Harriet's car.

135
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:33,480
It'll be hard to save them now.

136
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,800
- When? When did he take it?
- Early this morning.

137
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,482
I said they didn't belong here.

138
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,189
And you don't, either.

139
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,240
Fuck!

140
00:16:58,356 --> 00:17:02,000
- Did he kill Alice?
- I don't know.

141
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:06,680
But Anna, she's dead?

142
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,440
There's a gravestone with the name
Anna on it. I don't know any more.

143
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,083
What about Astrid?
Is she okay?

144
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,124
I've already told you everything I know.

145
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,809
Asking more won't help.

146
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:23,760
Okay.

147
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:32,013
Oh, it's you.

148
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:36,600
I'm calling the police now.

149
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,488
- No, you're not.
- He's been gone too long, Frank.

150
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:41,156
Give me the phone.

151
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,694
Everything's going to hell,
and it's all your fault.

152
00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:54,560
Where are you going now?

153
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:58,800
I'm going to look for my child.

154
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:10,552
You're so fucking ungrateful!

155
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:13,800
I've done fucking everything.

156
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:20,800
What do I get? Nothing!
Not shit! Damn you.

157
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:25,160
You're all the same.
"Hi, Frank. You're the best, Frank."

158
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:28,400
- "You're so fucking nice, Frank!"
- Frank!

159
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,680
Of course everything's fine! You sit in
that fucking house and look down on us.

160
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,183
But you don't know shit, Harriet!

161
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,360
You know what? It's over!
We're not together anymore.

162
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:52,560
Take your fucking brat and get lost.
Your ungrateful little snot.

163
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,440
I don't need you!
Understand?

164
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:59,634
Dammit! You shit!

165
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:43,840
Astrid?

166
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:02,402
Two people are in the house.

167
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,920
- And Astrid is one?
- Her and Frank.

168
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:09,529
- Frank seems unstable.
- Weapons?

169
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:12,709
He has a license for three guns.

170
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,640
What do we do?
Go in or no?

171
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,040
If he's armed, It might be
best to negotiate.

172
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:23,800
Or not.

173
00:20:26,973 --> 00:20:28,478
We go in.

174
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,189
Sit here.

175
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:43,093
They're going to take everything from me.

176
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:47,211
What do you mean? Who?

177
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,520
I love you like you were my own.
I always have.

178
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,600
It could have been different.

179
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:05,160
- Frank?
- Your mother...

180
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,000
She wanted to leave after
all I did for her.

181
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,160
- They died in a plane crash.
- But it's over now.

182
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,720
Sorry, Astrid.
I wish there was another way.

183
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,080
Astrid!

184
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:39,480
In!

185
00:21:50,197 --> 00:21:51,685
Astrid!

186
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,520
Incredible, Saga! Incredible!

187
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:07,880
Good, but I missed part of the case.
Can I get a report?

188
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:18,040
Forensics didn't find anything
at Nicole and Tobias' or Solveig's camper.

189
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,680
But the camper was in Sweden
when Patrik and Leonora were killed.

190
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,520
But Solveig was here when Moyo's wife
was hanged and Henrik was shot.

191
00:24:28,081 --> 00:24:30,746
Moyo told only her
that he betrayed Tommy.

192
00:24:30,826 --> 00:24:35,520
She won't say if she told anyone
unless we waterboard her.

193
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,440
We can't keep them any longer.
We need to let Solveig and Nicole go.

194
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,720
We went through Krabbe's computer.
He was very interested in Silas Tuksen.

195
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,720
Tuksen? The treehugger from the gay bar?

196
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,000
It isn't clear why he was interested
in Tuksen -

197
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,189
but there's a document with his name
and Margrethe's and William's.

198
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:59,141
Okay. See if you can find more
on Silas Tuksen.

199
00:25:18,988 --> 00:25:21,720
- I can just take the train.
- Jump in.

200
00:25:37,627 --> 00:25:41,080
This is the last time
we talk about my brother.

201
00:25:41,483 --> 00:25:43,333
How long were you together?

202
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,760
It was one time,
and we were piss drunk.

203
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,240
- It was at that party...
- One time?

204
00:25:53,444 --> 00:25:54,640
Yeah.

205
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:02,960
Sonny is my son,
and you're my wife.

206
00:26:04,837 --> 00:26:09,200
Everyone makes mistakes.
We're going home now.

207
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:41,971
Hi, sweetie.

208
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:47,360
- Hi, Grandma.
- I need to borrow your computer.

209
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,240
- The library was closed.
- What's happened?

210
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,120
- Were you at the police station?
- Yeah. They're going to hear about it.

211
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,480
Do you really think someone in the family
has someone to do with all this?

212
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,150
Yeah. They're idiots.

213
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:09,719
What did you say?
What did they ask you about?

214
00:27:10,452 --> 00:27:14,400
I said nothing.
You won't, either.

215
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,280
- What would I say?
- No, exactly.

216
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:21,800
Roll over and make some coffee
for Grandma. And some sandwiches!

217
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,920
Those idiots didn't give me anything
to eat. They'll hear about that, too.

218
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,000
- They sure will!
- They sure will, yeah.

219
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:35,840
- I found Henrik's daughter.
- Congrats.

220
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,545
- How does it feel?
- Good. I did well not to give up.

221
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:44,120
Do you always do the right thing?

222
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,840
Yes, but it's often wrong, too,
when I do the right thing.

223
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:54,174
How so?

224
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:01,306
Like with my parents, Jennifer,
Pernille, Martin, Emil.

225
00:28:02,446 --> 00:28:06,080
Have you ever tried
not doing the right thing?

226
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,166
Disregarding what you know
and going with your gut feeling?

227
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,496
I'm police.

228
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,281
Do you need to be that
around the clock?

229
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,601
Yes. I do.

230
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,560
Try to find a situation where
you can ignore what's right -

231
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,972
and do what feels right.

232
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,965
It's the same thing.

233
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,225
It doesn't need to be.

234
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:45,160
There are situations where you can
let yourself be a little more selfish.

235
00:28:50,694 --> 00:28:52,875
Like what, for example?

236
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,350
You're going to find out.

237
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:06,619
I'm here. I'm here.

238
00:29:10,988 --> 00:29:13,144
Frank said you were dead.

239
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,271
I'd forgotten you.

240
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,095
It doesn't matter.

241
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,360
Is Mom dead?

242
00:29:29,113 --> 00:29:30,480
Yeah.

243
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:40,212
Do you want to speak Danish?
I heard that you can.

244
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:43,280
It doesn't matter.

245
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,820
You can talk whenever you want to.

246
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,600
Hi.

247
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:09,560
She's healthy physically. No diseases
or infections. Everything seems fine.

248
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:12,280
Good.

249
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,613
But how she really is we don't know.

250
00:30:18,114 --> 00:30:22,720
I'll talk to our psychologist
and come back tomorrow.

251
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,320
Thank you.
Because you never gave up.

252
00:30:43,285 --> 00:30:45,132
How is she?

253
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,440
Physically okay.
He didn't mistreat her.

254
00:30:52,842 --> 00:30:55,220
She lived with him longer than with you.

255
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,327
Yeah, I know.

256
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:02,640
After so long, the victim forms
a strong bond with the captor.

257
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,473
I know it will be hard.

258
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,440
Can we not talk about it right now?

259
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,467
Can I update you on the case?

260
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:17,784
No, you don't need to do that right now.

261
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:20,854
- I need to get back.
- But...

262
00:31:21,743 --> 00:31:24,476
Is it okay between us?

263
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,760
Yeah.
Everything's good between us.

264
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,237
Good.

265
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:44,600
- What did she say?
- Who, the doctor?

266
00:31:44,788 --> 00:31:48,222
She said everything looks really good.

267
00:31:49,461 --> 00:31:53,360
- And then I met Saga.
- Who is Saga?

268
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,440
Saga's my friend.
My best friend.

269
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:03,814
Do you have friends?

270
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:09,280
In the city there.
Someone you want to see?

271
00:32:10,816 --> 00:32:12,533
I like Christoffer.

272
00:32:14,486 --> 00:32:20,080
But mostly I dressed up and pretended
I was someone else.

273
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:42,680
Hi.

274
00:32:49,062 --> 00:32:52,360
- Thanks. That was really nice.
- Yeah.

275
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,000
It's not that late.
We could stay out.

276
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,960
No, we can't.

277
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,280
I was just thinking a beer, or...

278
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,160
I don't want anyone to think
you mean anything to me.

279
00:33:07,242 --> 00:33:11,432
Wow. That's one of the worst rejections
I've ever gotten.

280
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,000
It's a long story, but it's about
our investigation.

281
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,160
There's someone taking revenge on people
by killing the people closest to them.

282
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,840
- I'm one of those people.
- Okay.

283
00:33:24,272 --> 00:33:30,320
That's why we can't drink any beer.
Not until we've found the killer, anyway.

284
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,200
I'll take that as a promise.

285
00:33:36,443 --> 00:33:38,233
Thanks for tonight.

286
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:17,640
Hi. Lillian Larsen Pettersson?

287
00:34:18,028 --> 00:34:21,640
- Yeah, that's me.
- They're for you. Here you are.

288
00:34:22,624 --> 00:34:25,097
- Enjoy.
- Thanks. Bye.

289
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,136
Lillian?

290
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:25,125
- Hans.
- What?

291
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:26,785
It's Hans.

292
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,736
Okay, everyone.
Can I have your attention a moment?

293
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:44,760
As you know, Lillian had a tragedy
yesterday. She'll be away a while.

294
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:50,680
Jonas Mandrup will be taking over,
and I can't stress enough how important -

295
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,398
it is to solve this case now.

296
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:56,736
Good luck.

297
00:36:57,416 --> 00:37:01,640
Yeah, okay. You heard the boss. Let's go.
What do we know about last night?

298
00:37:02,155 --> 00:37:05,247
Forensics has it as the highest priority.

299
00:37:06,003 --> 00:37:13,440
The head was Hans Pettersson's.
There was no evidence. No fingerprints.

300
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,560
- Do we know who sent it?
- A man, they think.

301
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,520
I have a possible motive for Silas Tuksen.
He had a brother, Jakob Tuksen.

302
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,560
He was in the criminal network KG.

303
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,840
He died in the attack that Tommy told
the Danish police about and they ignored.

304
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:35,880
Silas may not be getting revenge
for Tommy, but those who let it happen.

305
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:38,626
Niels, William, Vibeke.

306
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:43,880
But Richard Dahlqvist? He wrote about it,
but what did he do wrong?

307
00:37:44,767 --> 00:37:47,120
I don't know. It's unclear.

308
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:51,640
Okay. Let's bring the gay guy in
and send a photo of him to the courier.

309
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:03,120
Saga, where are you going?

310
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,720
- I'm going to work.
- Okay, but you need to do it here.

311
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,880
Shooting's the only thing left on the list
and we can't protect you if you go.

312
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,040
I can't work well here.
This is important to me.

313
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,720
More important than living?

314
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,886
I don't know.

315
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:23,400
Okay, then vest on at all times.
Full attention!

316
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,600
- And let us know where you are.
- Okay.

317
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,396
No, wait here.
I'm coming with you. I'm coming.

318
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,600
- Silas isn't here.
- I thought he was here all the time.

319
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,440
- He's been away a while.
- How long?

320
00:38:42,968 --> 00:38:47,018
- Three, four days.
- If he's not here, is he at home, or?

321
00:38:47,873 --> 00:38:49,565
I just work here.

322
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,740
Are you sure about that?

323
00:38:53,073 --> 00:38:55,760
Do you know if he's having sex
with anyone?

324
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,160
- Like I said, I just work here.
- Does he have an office?

325
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,869
Yeah, but I'm not sure it's okay
to show you.

326
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:03,539
Where is it?

327
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,889
Hi, Julie. Hi, Ida.

328
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,480
Now, listen.
I've gone through your case -

329
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,120
and there's some holes
you need to help me fill.

330
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,106
You've lived on the street
since your mother died.

331
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:24,600
More or less.

332
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,261
And you don't want to go back
to your stepfather.

333
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:34,544
Do you want to tell me why?

334
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,417
He was too interested.

335
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:47,760
Listen. You're not going to be sent back
to your stepfather.

336
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,880
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

337
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,720
Positive. Because he and
your mother weren't married -

338
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,880
and he didn't adopt you.
So that's completely ruled out.

339
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,920
But I'll find a really good
foster family for you.

340
00:40:04,522 --> 00:40:06,240
Can't we just live with you?

341
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,160
No, that's unfortunately
not a possibility.

342
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,000
But I promise to find you something
really good.

343
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,400
- Didn't you want to go to the movies?
- Yeah.

344
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,280
Can you find a film you want to see?
But nothing too scary.

345
00:40:23,697 --> 00:40:25,381
Bye for now.

346
00:40:38,116 --> 00:40:40,640
- Did you bring Silas in?
- No.

347
00:40:41,015 --> 00:40:45,280
The courier couldn't confirm
if he brought in the basket.

348
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,801
It feels so strange.
All that with Hans.

349
00:40:58,628 --> 00:41:02,240
He hired me when I'd just moved to Malmo.

350
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,719
Do you know that?

351
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:06,817
No.

352
00:41:07,703 --> 00:41:09,965
It was 15 years ago.

353
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,061
Saga, take care of yourself, okay?

354
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,960
So nothing happens to you.

355
00:41:19,889 --> 00:41:21,679
I like you.

356
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,921
I like working with you.

357
00:41:26,147 --> 00:41:27,554
Thanks.

358
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,066
I like working with you, too.
You're effective and competent.

359
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:35,920
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

360
00:41:39,112 --> 00:41:42,400
The excavator in the cemetery.
I know where it comes from.

361
00:41:51,973 --> 00:41:55,120
- Silas Tuksen.
- We'll put out a warrant for him.

362
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,240
I want to know everything about him
and that car, okay?

363
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,220
I thought you said we were going home.

364
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,490
This is home.

365
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:00,855
It's exactly like it was
when you disappeared.

366
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,225
I just waited for you to come back.

367
00:43:09,684 --> 00:43:11,480
I never gave up.

368
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:57,400
She was sick.

369
00:44:00,462 --> 00:44:02,374
She had a stomachache.

370
00:44:07,388 --> 00:44:09,202
We waited because...

371
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,649
Dad didn't like being at the hospital.

372
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:20,755
But she got worse.

373
00:44:24,564 --> 00:44:26,281
And then...

374
00:44:29,576 --> 00:44:31,244
Then she died.

375
00:44:44,596 --> 00:44:47,640
- I can't allow that.
- Yes, you can.

376
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,440
You're not here as a police officer.

377
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,920
He has nothing to do with your case
at this point.

378
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,040
No one needs to know that.

379
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,211
- I know.
- Linn, it's 8 years.

380
00:44:59,553 --> 00:45:03,854
He had them for 8 years.
He probably killed my wife.

381
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,113
- And he let one of my children die.
- That's exactly why.

382
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,640
Do you have children?

383
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,194
I did.

384
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,170
I got Astrid back.

385
00:45:27,187 --> 00:45:29,888
I got her back, but she's still his.

386
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,766
If I'm going to have a chance -

387
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,370
you need to help me
get him out of my system.

388
00:45:38,177 --> 00:45:40,561
Linn, she's at my house.

389
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,301
But she's not back.

390
00:45:45,364 --> 00:45:49,456
I need to get her back completely.
Understand?

391
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,760
What happened?

392
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,680
- What happened when?
- When you took my family.

393
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,080
I didn't take them.
They followed me willingly.

394
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,738
Henrik!

395
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,749
What happened?

396
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:50,475
I'd heard about you. Both of you, rather.
That it was bad at home.

397
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,309
So I suggested a trip.

398
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,360
Later that night, she wanted
to go home -

399
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,440
but I thought she should stay
so you could miss them a little.

400
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,200
But she refused to stay and...

401
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,175
It got heated.

402
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,880
She fell... badly.

403
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,480
I said to the girls that Alice went back
to Copenhagen to talk to you.

404
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,160
That they could stay with me
and you'd get them later.

405
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,896
Later, I said that both of you
were in a plane crash.

406
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,400
It was never my plan
for the girls to be mine.

407
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,611
They weren't, either.

408
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:42,480
They were never yours.

409
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,400
That's up for debate.

410
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,360
Anna.

411
00:48:07,495 --> 00:48:11,295
I'd decided to bring her to the hospital -

412
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:13,265
when she...

413
00:48:17,342 --> 00:48:18,880
It happened so fast.

414
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,680
I've wished every day since
that I'd handled it differently.

415
00:48:28,183 --> 00:48:31,760
I never hurt them.
Never.

416
00:48:33,056 --> 00:48:36,520
They had it good with me.
Ask Astrid.

417
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,854
Tell me about them.
Tell me what I missed.

418
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,720
- You missed 8 years.
- Yeah. But you're not going anywhere.

419
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:07,600
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
He's from Forensics in Lund.

420
00:49:09,229 --> 00:49:12,560
- Yeah. What can I help you with?
- You got in a head tonight.

421
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:17,756
- This morning. We're here to pick it up.
- It's part of a murder investigation.

422
00:49:17,836 --> 00:49:21,520
The person has been buried
for almost two years.

423
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,680
I did the forensic examination
when he died.

424
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,440
There's a clear advantage for the same
doctor to do both examinations.

425
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,800
Yeah, but I need to clear it
with the lead investigator.

426
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,751
She sent this.

427
00:49:39,193 --> 00:49:43,000
I have everything needed
for transport in the car.

428
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,160
Yeah, okay.

429
00:49:53,277 --> 00:49:55,303
You can still back out.

430
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,560
- Take it with you.
- Do you want that?

431
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:00,946
- No.
- Good.

432
00:50:23,764 --> 00:50:28,200
- So Jonas has my job now?
- Yes, temporarily.

433
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,941
Thanks.
I can't go into the kitchen.

434
00:50:35,207 --> 00:50:39,373
- Do you really want to be here, then?
- Where else would I go?

435
00:50:43,266 --> 00:50:45,760
I took the head from Forensics -

436
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,625
and put it back in the grave
and closed it up.

437
00:50:50,658 --> 00:50:55,800
- Wasn't it still evidence?
- Forensics was finished with it.

438
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,560
But I forged your signature
on a document to get it out.

439
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,880
For police, it was wrong,
but it felt right -

440
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,840
that the head should be with the body.

441
00:51:10,932 --> 00:51:12,120
Thanks.

442
00:51:19,597 --> 00:51:21,110
I have to go.

443
00:51:22,664 --> 00:51:24,023
Goodbye.

444
00:51:40,089 --> 00:51:42,245
Why do you think Tuksen is here?

445
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,900
He drove around in the open.
Last time, he was on the way here -

446
00:51:47,464 --> 00:51:49,538
and he never drove out.

447
00:52:06,351 --> 00:52:07,799
Clear!

448
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,760
What the hell...

449
00:52:38,878 --> 00:52:41,320
There.

450
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,670
- What is it?
- It's duck.

451
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,840
Duck breast.

452
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,862
We never got that at home.

453
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,994
It used to be your favorite dish.

454
00:53:01,454 --> 00:53:03,113
It looks good.

455
00:53:07,144 --> 00:53:10,399
Just eat.
I'll see who it is.

456
00:53:17,668 --> 00:53:18,960
Hi.

457
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,630
I wanted to bring you to the meeting.

458
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:28,277
- I'm not coming.
- Yes you are.

459
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,004
I could see it on you
the last time I saw you.

460
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,747
No, no. I stopped.

461
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:43,017
I had a relapse, but I stopped again.

462
00:53:44,423 --> 00:53:46,240
My daughter is here.

463
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,640
- Your daughter?
- Yeah. Astrid.

464
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,480
- That's great. Congrats.
- Thanks.

465
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,746
- That's fantastic, man.
- Yeah.

466
00:54:03,247 --> 00:54:05,480
I'll get going, then.

467
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,210
I'll see you at some point, huh?

468
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,080
- Yeah.
- I'll come. Later.

469
00:54:21,673 --> 00:54:24,560
I think you've had enough
coffee and tea today.

470
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,754
Yeah, I have.

471
00:54:27,794 --> 00:54:30,560
- This is much better.
- Thanks.

472
00:54:42,103 --> 00:54:44,320
I checked Jonas' phones.

473
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:49,680
He called a prepaid number several times,
and each time, case details were leaked.

474
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,237
- Did you call the number?
- Someone said hello...

475
00:54:52,317 --> 00:54:56,600
...but as soon as I started to talk,
the call dropped. It's been off since.

476
00:54:57,524 --> 00:55:01,720
- That bastard.
- It's only circumstantial evidence.

477
00:55:04,488 --> 00:55:08,133
He has your job.
You know that, right?

478
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,946
Yeah.

479
00:55:11,189 --> 00:55:13,524
But he won't have it much longer.

480
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,120
This is my friend.
She's coming, too.

481
00:55:22,637 --> 00:55:25,760
Hey. I'm Susanne.
What are your names?

482
00:55:25,991 --> 00:55:29,640
- Julie and Ida.
- Did you decide what we're seeing?

483
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,103
- I was allowed to decide.
- Hop in.

484
00:55:33,183 --> 00:55:34,795
Before we're late.

485
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:57,952
- When were you at the movies last?
- A long time ago.

486
00:55:58,431 --> 00:56:01,640
- With our mother.
- What did you see?

487
00:56:01,889 --> 00:56:05,280
I can't remember.
An animated movie?

488
00:56:05,746 --> 00:56:08,845
- Can you remember?
- No, not really.

489
00:56:12,398 --> 00:56:16,560
Sorry. That's my bag.
You can throw it in the back.

490
00:56:34,574 --> 00:56:36,054
Are you okay?

491
00:56:38,858 --> 00:56:40,623
Yeah. Yeah.

492
00:57:05,435 --> 00:57:08,880
I really don't feel good.
Can we pull over?

493
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,489
- She gets car sick easily.
- Two seconds. I'm pulling over here.

494
00:57:22,315 --> 00:57:25,480
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, we'll handle it.

495
00:57:29,036 --> 00:57:31,868
- Are you ready?
- I thought we were going after the movie.

496
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,016
No. We're going now.

497
00:57:35,195 --> 00:57:36,280
Hey!

498
00:57:38,571 --> 00:57:39,746
Stop!

498
00:57:40,305 --> 00:58:40,922

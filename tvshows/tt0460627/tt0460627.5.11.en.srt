1
00:00:00,515 --> 00:00:02,683
I can't hear you--
the reception's bad out here.

2
00:00:02,751 --> 00:00:05,820
Aliens? I told you, baby,
I'm done hunting aliens.

3
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:08,456
I... am on the road.

4
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:10,391
Yeah, in Florida. Yeah.

5
00:00:10,459 --> 00:00:13,461
What? No, I'm in my hotel room
working late.

6
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:16,864
You're just gonna
have to trust me, babe.

7
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:20,534
Yeah. Well, I'm s... I'm sorry
that's the way you feel.

8
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:26,907
A s-souvenir from Florida.

9
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:29,076
Okay.

10
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:32,813
Oh, babe, I can't take a...
like, a list right now.

11
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:35,950
Well, there are no pens...

12
00:00:36,018 --> 00:00:38,953
or pads in this hotel.

14
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:50,931
Oh, my God!

15
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:52,266
Babe!

16
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,068
I found one.

17
00:00:55,237 --> 00:00:57,171
(quietly):
No, not a pen...

18
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,040
an alien.

19
00:00:59,107 --> 00:01:01,142
A real one.

20
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:03,878
Oh, my God, I gotta
get a picture of this.

21
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:06,013
(trembling gasp,
cell phone camera clicks)

22
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:06,947
(rustling in distance)

23
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:09,050
What's that?!

24
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:10,885
Oh...

25
00:01:10,952 --> 00:01:14,321
Baby... there's more of 'em.

26
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:17,458
(quiet panting,
leaves, twigs crackling)

27
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:20,594
I-I come in peace.

28
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:24,065
I'm... Marvin Breekman,
but you can call me Marvin.

29
00:01:24,132 --> 00:01:26,133
Or Marv.

30
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:30,438
(screaming)

31
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:33,774

32
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:36,043
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

33
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:38,279
(whimpering, crying)

34
00:01:41,983 --> 00:01:43,918
I made reservations at the club.

35
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:45,753
Deejay Spider tonight,

36
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:48,956
then, uh, back to my place?

37
00:01:49,024 --> 00:01:51,926
I'm not sure if I
can wait for tonight.

38
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:54,929
Okay, I was fine
until you just said that.

39
00:01:54,996 --> 00:01:58,699
You know, I have a key
to the Egyptian storage room.

40
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:00,601
Not on campus,
not at work.

41
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:03,504
Come on, are you really
as virtuous as you seem?

42
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:07,575
(laughing)
I can be very bad
when the time is right.

43
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:11,312
We do get a very
generous lunch break,

44
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:14,115
and there's a little hotel
a few blocks from here.

45
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:16,317
Wow, Mr. Bray.

46
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:19,019
(clears throat)
Dr. Saroyan, um,

47
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:20,421
I was just
asking Angela

48
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:22,656
if she could do
some 3-D modeling of a, um,

49
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:24,925
shattered femur that I was given
by the archaeology department.

50
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:26,327
Save it, Mr. Bray.

51
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:29,463
You think you have
the big secret, but you don't.

52
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:34,301
I thought we were
being subtle.

53
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:36,871
Oh, man, do you
think Hodgins knows?

54
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,445
(sighs)

55
00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:47,848
(Booth)
Can you imagine if we found
an alien-- a real one?

56
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,351
You mean someone who slipped
illegally into the country

57
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:51,786
from Mexico or Canada?

58
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:53,053
Come on, Bones,
you don't believe

59
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:54,688
that there are other real
life-forms out there?

60
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:57,358
Well, the probability
is very high,

61
00:02:57,425 --> 00:02:59,193
but any aliens visiting
this planet

62
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:00,361
would have
sufficient intelligence

63
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:02,229
not to die
in the middle of the desert.

64
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:04,799
Hey. FBI Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

65
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:07,001
This here is Dr. Temperance
Brennan from the Jeffersonian.

66
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:08,369
Sheriff
Jerry Bonds,

67
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:10,471
but you probably got that
from my shiny badge,

68
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:12,072
my imposing gun, and my big hat.

69
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,073
Yeah. Right.

70
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:14,241
Remains are
over there.

71
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:17,578
(Officer)
They're right over there.

72
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:18,913
Been there
for a while.

73
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,915
(Booth)
Whoa!

74
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:22,583
Looks like an
alien to me.

75
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:24,985
Judging by the pelvic inlet
and the pubic symphysis--

76
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:27,121
female,

77
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:28,823
maybe 30 years old.

78
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,124
Earth female?

79
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:31,859
Yes.

80
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:34,261
Body moisture was trapped
by this silver coat

81
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:36,330
she's wearing, turning some
of her fat into adipocere.

82
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:39,466
I have no idea why it's so hard.

83
00:03:39,534 --> 00:03:40,968
Didn't even dig
a shallow grave.

84
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:42,403
Just left her
here to be eaten.

85
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,672
Which is the smartest possible
way to get rid of human remains.

86
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,740
What the hell
is going on here now?

87
00:03:46,808 --> 00:03:47,741
(Booth)
Oh, easy. FBI.

88
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:49,510
Put the shotgun down, ma'am.

89
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:50,578
This is my land.

90
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:52,246
I've got a right
to protect my land.

91
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:55,182
Yeah, uh-huh, Marsha,
but we got a dead body.

92
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,086
A woman,
seems like.

93
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:00,087
(Marsha)
Great.

94
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:01,989
Now I've got dead people.

95
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:03,424
You don't know
anything about this?

96
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:05,359
Nope.
I want
the remains brought

97
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:07,595
back to the Jeffersonian
for examination.

98
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:08,896
Nuh-uh, not going to happen.

99
00:04:08,964 --> 00:04:09,997
My jurisdiction,
my body.

100
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:11,532
She stays here.
No, FBI

101
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,300
has got jurisdiction on
this case. You want it, right?

102
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:14,935
Mm-hmm.
The FBI will keep you
apprised.

103
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:17,838
Nuh-uh, FBI's got jurisdiction
only if I agree.

104
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:19,607
Otherwise, you need to jump
through several legal hoops,

105
00:04:19,674 --> 00:04:20,608
which will take
some time,

106
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:22,142
during which time

107
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,677
the victim stays in town.

108
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:24,778
Then why did you call us?

109
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:26,213
I could use the help,

110
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:28,482
but I'm not going to take
the heat when people scream

111
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,185
I sent an alien off to
Washington for secret testing.

112
00:04:31,253 --> 00:04:32,253
(chuckles)

113
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,888
I've been through that before.

114
00:04:33,955 --> 00:04:36,223
These remains are
not extraterrestrial.

It's a perfect place for you

Ma'am.

Hey, uh, you're going
to be okay here

132
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:46,868
all alone
in this spooky hospital

133
00:05:46,936 --> 00:05:49,838
with a dead alien body?

134
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:51,072
Yes.

135
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,943
Right... that would be me
who wouldn't want that.

136
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:58,547
The remains are encased
in adipocere.

137
00:05:58,614 --> 00:05:59,981
(Saroyan)
If it's okay with Sheriff Lobo,

138
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:02,083
maybe you could send me some.

139
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:03,852
It appears to be petrified.

140
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,854
A coat alone doesn't account
for that.

141
00:06:05,922 --> 00:06:07,422
I'll send the coat to Hodgins,

142
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,090
see what he can discern from it.

143
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:10,926
Her skeletal
robusticity

144
00:06:10,993 --> 00:06:13,895
and large areas
of muscle attachment suggest

145
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:15,497
extremely good health.

146
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:16,932
A couple weeks
in the desert,

147
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:18,633
and no critters got
at these remains?

148
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:20,068
Perhaps the result
of green radiation

149
00:06:20,136 --> 00:06:22,137
from alien
hyperdrive systems?

150
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:27,576
Or something not crazy.

151
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:29,110
(Brennan)
The man who found them remarked

152
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:31,246
that he saw several sets
of orange eyes

153
00:06:31,314 --> 00:06:33,281
staring at him
from the darkness.

154
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,517
Orange-eyeballed aliens?

158
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,894
What he saw were likely coyotes,

Oh, you were being facetious.

160
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,133
That's funny.

161
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:53,168
(Sweets)
Wearing your earpiece,

162
00:06:53,236 --> 00:06:54,536
he's not going
to be able to hear me,

163
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:56,238
so I can help you
with your interrogation.

164
00:06:56,305 --> 00:07:00,876
Some people who chase UFOs
believe in alien abductions.

165
00:07:00,943 --> 00:07:02,878
Now, these people tend to be

166
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:05,780
drebmy, um,
highly suggestible,

167
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:08,817
and possess a strong belief
that there is something

168
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:11,219
larger than them out there,

169
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:12,654
something
that they can't control.

170
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:14,656
Look, I only found
the body.

171
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:16,258
I didn't make it dead.

172
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:18,894
Okay, that's, that's
very dissociative language:

173
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:20,462
"Make it dead."

174
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,696
So, Mr. Breekman,
you were abducted

175
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:22,931
by aliens five years ago?

176
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:23,999
Yes.

177
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:25,233
If the aliens are
so advanced,

178
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:27,135
why would they need probes?

179
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:29,704
I think they like it.

180
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:31,139
Why would you hook up
with aliens

181
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:32,574
if they like
to anally probe you?

182
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:35,110
Th-There are
two races of aliens

183
00:07:35,177 --> 00:07:37,479
and they do not see eye to eye.

184
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:39,381
Right.

185
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:41,483
I-I know things.

186
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:45,253
I get laughed at, but I persist
because I know things.

187
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:46,688
It just seems
like maybe I deserve

188
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:48,990
a little respect for that.

189
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:50,759
All right, of course.

190
00:07:50,826 --> 00:07:52,160
I apologize.

191
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:54,829
Okay, then, can I go home?

192
00:07:54,897 --> 00:07:57,332
Why were you in the desert
last night?

193
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,634
I was looking for UFOs.

194
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:01,002
No, I mean
to that specific area.

195
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,872
I mean, what are the chances
of you stumbling across a body

196
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,074
in the dark...

197
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:07,175
The vastness...

198
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:08,443
...vastness of, of the desert?

199
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:09,678
You really want me to believe

200
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:11,713
that that's some kind
of big coincidence?

201
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:15,750
Yes, it, it was a coincidence.

202
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:19,554
I don't believe you.

203
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:21,222
I think
you're lying.

204
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,324
Sometimes I think
you just pull me

205
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:23,825
into these interrogations
to show off.

206
00:08:23,893 --> 00:08:26,127
Wait, Booth, I--

207
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:27,262
(Booth sighs)

208
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,130
Until you tell the truth,
you know what?

209
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:30,398
You're not going home.

210
00:08:42,712 --> 00:08:44,846
You have something
on your mind?

211
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:48,783
This thing that we
have going here...

212
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:51,987
You're worried
about Cam knowing?

213
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:54,689
(chuckling):
No, no.

214
00:08:54,757 --> 00:08:57,559
I'm worried about
Hodgins not knowing.

215
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:03,531
Listen...

216
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:06,101
Wendell...

217
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:08,670
Hodgins and I
are in the past.

218
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:10,739
I mean, if you were really,
totally in the past,

219
00:09:10,806 --> 00:09:13,508
then we wouldn't be keeping
this a secret from him.

220
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:15,543
Do you want me
to tell Hodgins?

221
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:18,747
If you don't mind,
I'd like to do it.

222
00:09:18,814 --> 00:09:19,914
He's my friend.

223
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:23,785
A man-to-man, look-him-
in-the-eye kind of thing?

224
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:25,787
Yeah, something like that.

225
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:27,489
(chuckles)

226
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:30,925
Okay, let's do it your way.

227
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,866
You mean talk to
Hodgins or...?

228
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:40,168
(both laughing)

229
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:41,436
You're the worst.

230
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:43,238
Both.

231
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:45,306
Consider this a do-over.

232
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,515
Do you know
who I am?

233
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:55,950
Oh, no, do you know who I am?

234
00:09:56,018 --> 00:09:57,318
FBI?

235
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:59,854
Military Intelligence?
That's an oxymoron, you know,

236
00:09:59,922 --> 00:10:01,356
a term
that contradicts itself.

237
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:02,557
I'm Delmy Polanco.

238
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,626
I'm the most important
UFO blogger in the world.

239
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:07,328
"Important blogger"--
talk about an oxymoron.

240
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:08,763
What can you tell me
about the alien body?

241
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:10,799
I don't know anything
about the alien body.

242
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:12,667
Definitely FBI.

243
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:14,703
I can practically
smell the suit.

244
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,971
I don't wear a suit
all the time, you know.

245
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,406
I see you've met Delmy.

246
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:20,141
I'm looking for info
into a foil-wrapped body

247
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:21,176
with alien features,

248
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:22,444
pieces of which
have already been sent

249
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:24,079
to the Jeffersonian
Institution

250
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:25,180
in Washington, D.C.

251
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,285
I'm invoking
the Freedom of Information Act,

252
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:32,754
which means you have to tell me
what I want to know.

253
00:10:32,822 --> 00:10:36,124
The Freedom of Information Act
is not a magic spell, Delmy.

254
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:39,194
It merely gives a citizen the
right to request information.

255
00:10:39,261 --> 00:10:42,197
I'm gonna post all this
on my blog tonight,

256
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:44,265
and by tomorrow morning,
this whole town

257
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,668
will be swarming with UFO nuts.

258
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:48,903
Trespassing again?

259
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:51,172
Well, this facility is clearly
marked private property.

260
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,241
Mm-hmm.

261
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:02,484
Oh, good-- you got here
for the good stuff.

262
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,285
What good stuff?
MRI.

263
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:06,988
It's an older model,
but entirely serviceable.

264
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:08,890
Okay, for future reference,
that's not the good stuff.

265
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,392
Well, sure it is-- look at
all those remodeled lateral
malleolus fractures.

266
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,862
Also, signs of
inflammation

267
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:17,031
to the tannin fibers here
and damaged--

268
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:18,099
(screams)

269
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:33,715
You know, I won't say
anything about the scream

270
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:34,783
if you don't say
anything about the gun.

271
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,051
Those terms
are satisfactory.
Right.

272
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:44,248
That's five.

273
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:45,649
Too big to be buckshot.

274
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:47,117
Photos you sent

275
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:48,285
of the first one show

276
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:49,853
to be a ball bearing
approximately

277
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:51,321
7.5 millimeters.

278
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:52,656
This makes number six.

279
00:11:52,724 --> 00:11:55,092
Certainly enough metal
to generate the magnetism

280
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,994
to raise the remains
when exposed to the MRI.

281
00:11:57,061 --> 00:11:58,896
Well, when I receive them,
I might be able

282
00:11:58,963 --> 00:12:00,531
to I.D. the manufacturer
and intended use,

283
00:12:00,598 --> 00:12:03,000
<i>which I imagine
was not murder.</i>

284
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:05,969
Hey. Uh, I finished
the facial reconstruction

285
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:07,037
off the MRI...

286
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:08,439
I'm emailing it now.

287
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:10,941
Sorry-- it is
not an alien.

288
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:12,142
I noticed on the MRI

289
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,310
that the victim's patellas
were fractured.

290
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:15,546
Well, I'll swab the area,

291
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:18,048
and send the samples
with the ball bearings.

292
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:20,050
Well, there's no striations
on the ball bearings

293
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:21,185
in this photo you sent,

294
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:22,453
so there's no evidence

295
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,487
that they
were shot.

296
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:25,556
Shotgun, maybe?
Full of ball bearings?

297
00:12:25,623 --> 00:12:28,225
Well, the owner of the ranch
threatened us

298
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:29,393
with a shotgun.

299
00:12:29,461 --> 00:12:31,962
Not so fast,
Dr. Brennan.

300
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,430
I know you dislike flesh,

301
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:35,332
but I'm going to need you to
remove the adipocere and organs

302
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,867
and send them to me.

303
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:38,635
Ooh, Dr. Brennan
dealing with flesh.

304
00:12:38,703 --> 00:12:40,137
Like a cat
dealing with water.

305
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:41,805
Flesh is not my strength.

306
00:12:41,873 --> 00:12:43,340
You're going
to need a hair dryer

307
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:44,541
and some cooking spray.

308
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:55,886
Yep, I've caught her trespassing
on my ranch a bunch of times.

309
00:12:55,954 --> 00:12:57,654
That's El Crazerita.

310
00:12:57,722 --> 00:12:59,590
El Crazerita.
You know her real name?

311
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:02,192
Nope. I don't make
friends with these nuts.

312
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,360
Sheriff Bon says
you've been charged

313
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:05,028
with misdemeanor assault
with a firearm

314
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:06,163
about three times.

315
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:08,899
Someone cut through this
fence, Agent Booth.

316
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,100
They were trespassers.

317
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:11,768
Which is why I was
never convicted.

318
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:13,170
Even though you shot at them?

319
00:13:13,238 --> 00:13:15,072
Salt.
Salt?

320
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:17,374
Salt. Rock salt.

321
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:19,209
Stings like a sumbitch.

322
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:20,744
Discourages trespassing.

323
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:23,046
You ever use ball bearings
instead of salt?

324
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:24,681
Ball bearings?!

325
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:26,917
Pssh!
That'd rip somebody apart.

326
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:30,287
Hmm. Like when you took a shot
at, uh, ol' El Crazerita?

327
00:13:30,355 --> 00:13:31,955
You think I killed her?

328
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:33,690
You think I'm
dumb enough

329
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:37,261
to spend my life in prison
for killing some alienhead nut

330
00:13:37,328 --> 00:13:39,429
who spent all her time
shooting stupid videos?

331
00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:40,898
Videos? Videos of what?

332
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:42,666
Videos of everything.

333
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:45,302
Looking for spacemen.

334
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,804
You want to know about her?
Ask Blaine Miller

335
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:49,773
at the Space Place Cafe.

336
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:51,742
She was always hanging
out at his diner

337
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:53,410
with the other fruitcakes.

338
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:54,645
Sure. Tell you what.
I'll take a look

339
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:55,946
at your shotgun there
and run some tests.

340
00:13:56,014 --> 00:13:58,081
You know, just to make sure.

341
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,927
Oh!

342
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:11,228
I did it!

343
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:12,496
Very good, Dr. Brennan.

344
00:14:12,564 --> 00:14:13,897
Yes, it was.

345
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:15,666
Now remove the stomach.

346
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:17,601
Oh.

347
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:21,438
She was covered in ethyl
parathion and aldicarb.

348
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:23,740
It was all over
her space-age outerwear.

349
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:25,075
It's an insecticide.

350
00:14:25,143 --> 00:14:26,610
It's extremely illegal
in the U.S.,

351
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:28,478
but it's still sold
south of the border.

352
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:31,014
It explains why the
adipocere dried so quickly.

353
00:14:31,082 --> 00:14:33,684
(Saroyan)
So, our victim was using
a dangerous insecticide.

354
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:35,652
Not unusual for someone

355
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,088
who's a couple of tacos
short of a combo plate.

356
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:39,923
Nice metaphor.
Thanks.

357
00:14:39,991 --> 00:14:41,158
I found something!

358
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:48,532
It's a memory card...
tied to a string.

359
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,334
It appears to be dental floss.

360
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:51,401
Check her teeth.

361
00:14:51,469 --> 00:14:53,570
Any evidence of floss
still on her teeth?

362
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:58,141
Yes.

363
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:01,378
There's a fragment tied
to the left second premolar.

364
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:02,946
She was hiding the card.

365
00:15:03,014 --> 00:15:04,181
It's an old prison trick.

366
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:06,350
She tied one end of the floss
to her tooth,

367
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:09,386
the other end to the memory
card, so if she needed it,

368
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:10,621
she could use the
floss to pull it up.

369
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:13,190
I'll overnight
the card to Angela.

370
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:17,494
Whatever is on it
was important enough to hide.

371
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:19,663
My guess, it's important
enough to kill for.

372
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:30,607
Hey, Hodgins.

373
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:32,509
Hey, man, did you hear?

374
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:35,312
Brennan's sending the victim's
SD card from Roswell.

375
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,281
Probably video on there the
government wanted suppressed.

376
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:40,017
Because at Area 51...
Right, um.

377
00:15:40,084 --> 00:15:41,752
Look, do you have a second?

378
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:43,553
Sure, yeah.

379
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:45,455
Something wrong?

380
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:47,457
We're friends, right?

381
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:49,159
Yeah.

382
00:15:49,227 --> 00:15:52,562
I don't lie or keep things
from my friends.

383
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,364
Okay, all right.

384
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:57,567
Angela and I...

385
00:15:57,635 --> 00:15:58,769
Oh.

386
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:00,404
(laughing):
You're kidding, right?

387
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:01,571
(laughs)

388
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:04,408
Go ahead, kid... (laughs)
knock yourself out.

389
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:06,476
Hey, good luck with that.

390
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:07,811
Hodgins, what I'm trying
to tell you

391
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,413
is that my luck
has already been good.

392
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,783
Oh.

393
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,118
I would never want
you to think that I...

394
00:16:15,186 --> 00:16:16,720
No, no, Wendell, Wendell,
stop, stop, stop.

395
00:16:16,788 --> 00:16:18,989
It's been over between
Angela and me for a long time.

396
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:20,223
I have moved on.

397
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,292
And you know what?
I'm happy for you, you know?

398
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,094
And for her.

399
00:16:24,162 --> 00:16:25,095
Really?

400
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:27,197
Yes, really.

401
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:28,365
You're both my friends.

402
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:29,900
Why wouldn't I be happy for you?

403
00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:33,537
I don't... okay.

404
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:35,038
Thanks, man.

405
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:37,407
Of course.
I'll tell you what, hey,

406
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:39,443
why don't the three of us
grab lunch together?

407
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,178
Huh?

408
00:16:41,245 --> 00:16:44,514
This is a good thing, Wendell,
this should not be weird for us.

409
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:46,083
Yeah, yeah, sure, lunch.

410
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,284
That sounds great, man.

411
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:49,319
Great, good, good.

412
00:16:52,824 --> 00:16:54,391
The stomach acid
ate away at the card,

413
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:55,592
but Angela says she should be

414
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,893
able to pull something
off of it.

415
00:16:56,961 --> 00:16:59,129
Well, Vinton said El Crazerita
shot a lot of video.

416
00:16:59,197 --> 00:17:00,864
Maybe she filmed
the real thing.

417
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:02,933
What, an extraterrestrial?

418
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,501
Yeah, look, you said it was
possible, all right?

419
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,903
But they have big eyes
and big heads, you know,

420
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:08,538
for the super-smart brain.

421
00:17:08,606 --> 00:17:11,641
That's far more logical
if they had the eyes of flies

422
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:13,610
and the exoskeleton
of a cockroach.

423
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:15,512
Insect people?

424
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,114
Insects can't fly a spaceship.

425
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:20,383
Well, the cockroach
is an evolutionary marvel.

426
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:21,651
They can withstand radiation,

427
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:23,320
live without breathing
for almost an hour,

428
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:25,589
go without eating for weeks.

429
00:17:25,656 --> 00:17:27,991
Imagine that combined
with an intelligence

430
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:29,659
that evolved
over many millennia.

431
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:31,428
Plus, they do have extra arms.

432
00:17:31,496 --> 00:17:34,664
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.

433
00:17:39,504 --> 00:17:41,338
Oh.

434
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:44,508
(Booth) Wow, would you
look at this place?

435
00:17:44,575 --> 00:17:46,243
Wow. This is so cool.

436
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,647
"UFO Museum Research Center."

437
00:17:50,715 --> 00:17:52,315
Check this out.
Look at those guns.

438
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,217
No way, Bones!
Look at this.

439
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:55,852
<i>Rocketship 7.
Hey, I used to watch that</i>

440
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,087
when I was a little boy.

441
00:17:57,155 --> 00:17:58,889
The Sweetlees,
and there was Mr. Beeper

442
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:00,323
and Promo the Robot.

443
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:02,225
Well, the way
this craft is designed,

444
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:04,427
it could never leave
the earth's atmosphere.

445
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:07,330
<i>Mmm, yeah, but according to
Dave Thomas and Rocketship 7,</i>

446
00:18:07,398 --> 00:18:09,432
you would go on
adventures like no other.

447
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,734
You two looking for aliens?

448
00:18:10,802 --> 00:18:12,903
The name's
Blaine Miller.
Not exactly.

449
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,104
Oh.

450
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:15,906
Oh, you hear about that body
they found

451
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:17,007
up at Vinton's place?

452
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:18,508
We never mentioned a body,
Mr. Miller.

453
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:20,443
Nothing travels faster
than the speed of light

454
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:21,878
than gossip in a small town.

455
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:23,046
Excuse me, sir?
Mm.

456
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:24,381
Why are all
these radios on?

457
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:26,149
Oh, well, this is some
of the original

458
00:18:26,217 --> 00:18:28,451
equipment that picked up
the signal from the craft

459
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:29,953
that landed right
here in Roswell.

460
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:34,491
Dave, these are the radios
that heard the aliens.

461
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,560
(Dave) Oh!
But that's absurd.
Why would she believe you?

462
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:38,228
Because they travel
all the way to Roswell

463
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:39,896
<i>to believe in aliens,
just like everybody else.</i>

464
00:18:39,964 --> 00:18:42,532
Do you recognize this woman,
Mr. Miller?

465
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,534
Sure. This is Ursula Lapine.

466
00:18:44,602 --> 00:18:45,802
She's a regular.

467
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,904
She the one who's dead?

468
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:49,573
When was the last time
you saw her?

469
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,807
Maybe a month ago.

470
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,108
She was having an argument
with another woman.

471
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:53,543
I had to tell her
to keep it down.

472
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:54,644
And who was this other woman?

473
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:56,479
I don't know;
I never saw her before.

474
00:18:56,547 --> 00:18:57,981
African-American, good-looking.

475
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:00,150
In a suit.
This woman Ursula--
she live around here?

476
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:01,518
Outside of town.

477
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:03,887
She's in one of those shiny,
spaceship-type trailers.

478
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:05,088
I think I hear something.

479
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:07,657
I think I hear
a spaceship.

480
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:09,693
(Brennan laughing)

481
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,094
(Brennan)
Okay.

482
00:19:11,162 --> 00:19:13,096
(laughs)

483
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:14,564
She was serious?

484
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:21,404
This must be the place--
spacey-looking trailer.

485
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:23,573
Oh, one of
the windows is broken.

486
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:26,109
All right.
Stay behind me, Bones.

487
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:58,808
Bones, I think
you need to see this.

488
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:00,210
<i>And you need to see this.</i>

489
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:03,480
There's blood on it.

490
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:05,382
Could have been
what busted her knees.

491
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:06,917
You got to check this out.

492
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:12,555
Oh, she seems very thorough.

493
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:15,525
Mmm. The word loony
come to mind?

494
00:20:15,593 --> 00:20:17,794
This is a remarkably
well-researched wall

495
00:20:17,862 --> 00:20:19,529
for a crazerita.

496
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:20,864
Crazerita is right.

497
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:22,265
What about this
here? Look.

498
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,433
Check this out, hmm?

499
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:24,567
Something was taken.

500
00:20:24,635 --> 00:20:25,869
Maybe that's why
Ursula was killed.

501
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:27,037
Well, this cinder block

502
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:28,471
was obviously used
in an assault.

503
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:29,873
We have to analyze the blood.

504
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:31,041
You know what?

505
00:20:31,108 --> 00:20:35,078
Maybe we can pull a print
off the block like this.

506
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:39,616
(Booth blowing)

507
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:41,818
All right.
Watch this.

508
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:43,887
This...

509
00:20:48,926 --> 00:20:50,460
That...

510
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:52,329
is magic.

511
00:20:52,396 --> 00:20:53,930
Science.

512
00:20:58,469 --> 00:20:59,703
Did you have any luck?

513
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,004
Was the data damaged?

514
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:02,238
Uh, a bit.

515
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:04,240
There might still be
a few corrupted frames.

516
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:05,542
So it's video.

517
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,143
Yeah, but I think
it's gonna play.

518
00:21:10,014 --> 00:21:13,650
(Montenegro):
Oh, my God, is that
what I think it is?

519
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:15,085
And are those...?

520
00:21:15,152 --> 00:21:16,386
No.

521
00:21:16,454 --> 00:21:18,621
(Saroyan)
Impossible.

522
00:21:18,689 --> 00:21:19,689
This was doctored.

523
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:21,391
No... it isn't.

524
00:21:21,459 --> 00:21:23,226
This was verified
by the scanning software

525
00:21:23,294 --> 00:21:24,461
at a pixel level.

526
00:21:41,956 --> 00:21:44,724
So, assuming that the figures
in the Hazmat suits are of

527
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:47,627
average height,
then this structure here must be

528
00:21:47,695 --> 00:21:49,629
about four to five meters tall.

529
00:21:49,697 --> 00:21:51,564
Why is the ground glowing?

530
00:21:51,632 --> 00:21:53,633
Uh, the light seems to be
emitting from a spilled liquid.

531
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:55,735
UFO fuel.

532
00:21:55,803 --> 00:21:58,471
What are those two
humanoid shapes there,

533
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:01,875
between the Hazmat-suited
humans and the craft?

534
00:22:01,942 --> 00:22:04,177
Well, look, I'm gonna keep
working on this footage,

535
00:22:04,245 --> 00:22:05,845
but you guys have to admit

536
00:22:05,913 --> 00:22:08,915
that this makes the hairs
on your arm stand on end, right?

537
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:12,585
The hairs on my arm
are not reacting in any way.

538
00:22:12,653 --> 00:22:13,987
But thanks, Angela.

539
00:22:14,054 --> 00:22:15,288
It's not a spaceship.

540
00:22:15,356 --> 00:22:17,524
Well, if it smells like a
duck, walks like a duck,

541
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:18,725
quacks like a duck...

542
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:21,327
But then it would be a duck,
not a spaceship,

543
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:22,929
so your point escapes me.

544
00:22:22,997 --> 00:22:24,864
It's just a
metaphor...
Have you decided
to let me go?

545
00:22:24,932 --> 00:22:26,432
(Booth)
No, actually, we have
a few more questions.

546
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,801
You ever been out to
Ursula Lapine's trailer?

547
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,436
No.

548
00:22:30,504 --> 00:22:31,704
Oh, we have evidence
that you're lying.

549
00:22:31,772 --> 00:22:33,273
Yep, you fell into
that one, Delmy.

550
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,775
(Brennan)
We have your fingerprints
on a cinder block

551
00:22:35,843 --> 00:22:37,544
that was used
to break into her trailer.

552
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:38,978
Also, blood.

553
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:40,480
And you took something
off her wall.

554
00:22:43,684 --> 00:22:45,318
If I give it to you,
will you drop

555
00:22:45,386 --> 00:22:46,653
the trespassing charges
and let me go?

556
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,954
If you don't hand it over,

557
00:22:48,022 --> 00:22:49,556
I'll just charge you
with obstructing justice,

558
00:22:49,623 --> 00:22:50,690
and he'll charge you

559
00:22:50,758 --> 00:22:52,692
with interfering with
a Federal investigation--

560
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,227
eh, maybe even murder--

561
00:22:54,295 --> 00:22:56,162
and you will pray
for the good old days,

562
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,697
where all you were
worrying about

563
00:22:57,765 --> 00:22:58,731
were those silly little

564
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,567
trespassing
and burglary charges.

565
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:03,369
I find he's very useful
in certain situations.

566
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:04,270
Very useful.

567
00:23:04,338 --> 00:23:06,439
So, gonna hand 'em over?

568
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,711
Oh.

569
00:23:12,813 --> 00:23:14,247
Holy cow.

570
00:23:15,716 --> 00:23:17,717
Pay dirt.

571
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:18,851
I gotta get better

572
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:20,853
at frisking.

573
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,055
Wait a minute.

574
00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:23,923
This is Ursula with Marvin.

575
00:23:23,991 --> 00:23:25,992
(Polanco)
I'm gonna need a copy

576
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,393
for my article:

577
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:31,364
"UFO-Obsessed Woman
Dies in Alien Encounter."

578
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:38,438
So the swab from the
victim's damaged patellas

579
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:40,740
show traces of sediment,
but it's not cement.

580
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:42,942
So what hit her knees
wasn't cinder block?

581
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,744
No, the sediment
is gypsum,

582
00:23:44,812 --> 00:23:47,747
dating back to the Pleistocene
and Holocene eras.

583
00:23:47,815 --> 00:23:49,515
It's probably from
the Tularosa

584
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:50,717
or Estancia Basins.

585
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,985
Mexico?!
Yeah.

586
00:23:52,052 --> 00:23:54,387
Northern Mexico is the closest
occurrence of this rock.

587
00:23:54,455 --> 00:23:56,289
Here's an interesting
conjunction of possibilities:

588
00:23:56,357 --> 00:23:58,157
the insecticide that
she was soaked in,

589
00:23:58,225 --> 00:23:59,892
it's called
"Tres Pasitos."

590
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,561
It's not available
in the United States.

591
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:02,729
Is it available
in Mexico?

592
00:24:02,796 --> 00:24:03,963
Readily.

593
00:24:04,031 --> 00:24:05,932
Excellent.

594
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,501
...so I took the information
that you gave me,

595
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:11,271
and it looks as though
the projectiles

596
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:14,274
first impacted next
to the juncture

597
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:16,376
between the frontal
and parietal bones.

598
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:18,211
(Bray) So the bearings
entered beneath her chin,

599
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,712
then ricocheted
around in her skull?

600
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,648
Yeah, that seems
to make the most sense.

601
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:23,683
But I've never heard
of any projectiles

602
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:26,786
<i>that would enter at that range
and not fracture the skull.</i>

603
00:24:26,854 --> 00:24:29,889
Well, what about, like,
slow-moving projectiles?

604
00:24:29,957 --> 00:24:31,424
Maybe a paintball gun?

605
00:24:31,492 --> 00:24:35,461
A little more powerful
than that, but not much.

606
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:37,330
Time for lunch.

607
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:38,831
Oh.

608
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:40,500
To prove we're all fine?

609
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,168
Yeah.

610
00:24:43,437 --> 00:24:45,204
(sighs)

611
00:24:51,845 --> 00:24:53,479
(sighs)

612
00:24:58,152 --> 00:25:00,386
You guys can hold
hands, if you want.

613
00:25:00,454 --> 00:25:02,322
Eat off each
other's plates...

614
00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:04,123
I mean, any and
all of that kind

615
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:07,093
of gooey romanticism is
completely fine by me.

616
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:09,429
We know, Hodgins.

617
00:25:09,496 --> 00:25:12,365
I'm not really the public
display kind of guy.

618
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:14,901
I'm just saying you don't need
to be afraid or...

619
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:24,143
There. See?

620
00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:26,779
My head did not explode.

621
00:25:26,847 --> 00:25:29,082
Um, I'm not really okay
with being kissed

622
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:30,683
when it's not about me.

623
00:25:30,751 --> 00:25:31,951
Sorry.

624
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:34,287
Panicked,
but everything's fine, right?

625
00:25:34,355 --> 00:25:35,955
(chuckling):
Everything's fine.

626
00:25:36,023 --> 00:25:37,590
Everything's not fine.

627
00:25:39,526 --> 00:25:41,260
This is a fraught situation.

628
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:46,132
It's important
to face these things head-on.

629
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,333
(Hodgins)
Sweets,

630
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:49,602
there's nothing to face, okay?

631
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,304
I mean, we can see

632
00:25:51,372 --> 00:25:53,172
why you'd think that,

633
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,341
but we're all fine.

634
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:59,045
I am... I'm fine.

635
00:26:01,915 --> 00:26:04,350
(waitress) Lance, your
order's ready.

636
00:26:04,418 --> 00:26:06,285
Thanks.

637
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,026
(Breekman)
Why are we here?

638
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:15,995
We want to know
what brought you out here

639
00:26:16,063 --> 00:26:17,597
the night you found
Ursula's body.

640
00:26:17,664 --> 00:26:19,399
I told you, I was
out UFO spotting.

641
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:22,068
And I told you I don't believe
in that big of a coincidence.

642
00:26:22,136 --> 00:26:23,503
How long were you
and Ursula lovers?

643
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,704
Go ahead. Take a look.

644
00:26:27,508 --> 00:26:29,409
Oh, my God.

645
00:26:31,478 --> 00:26:33,246
Ursula understood.

646
00:26:33,313 --> 00:26:34,981
Sh-She believed.

647
00:26:35,048 --> 00:26:37,216
My wife thought I was crazy.

648
00:26:37,284 --> 00:26:39,285
What makes this patch of desert
any different to you

649
00:26:39,353 --> 00:26:40,887
than any other patch of desert?

650
00:26:42,489 --> 00:26:44,557
This is where we were
when we first saw the lights.

651
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:46,192
Where did you see the lights?

652
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,894
Beyond those hills.

653
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:50,062
Hot spheres, very clear.

654
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:52,665
Ursula and I
saw them together.

655
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:54,033
How far?

656
00:26:55,068 --> 00:26:57,069
Maybe two kilometers.

657
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:58,504
That would be Mexico.

658
00:26:58,572 --> 00:27:00,139
We were going
to check it out together

659
00:27:00,207 --> 00:27:01,641
next time I came through town.

660
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:03,743
We... We'd meet every few weeks.

661
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:05,545
So, you and Ursula
were true believers.

662
00:27:05,612 --> 00:27:06,946
Not really.

663
00:27:07,014 --> 00:27:10,149
Ursula-- she was convinced
that if she could find proof

664
00:27:10,217 --> 00:27:13,286
of alien visitation,
it would make her rich.

665
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:14,887
What happened to her, Marvin?

666
00:27:14,955 --> 00:27:16,289
Really.

667
00:27:16,356 --> 00:27:18,257
What do you think?

668
00:27:20,294 --> 00:27:23,362
I think she came out here
without me.

669
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,532
Maybe she thought
I wanted half her money.

670
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,735
She maybe saw the lights
and crossed over,

671
00:27:29,803 --> 00:27:32,638
and they took her...

672
00:27:32,706 --> 00:27:33,806
and experimented on her,

673
00:27:33,874 --> 00:27:35,541
and then they dumped Ursula
in the desert,

674
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:38,010
like the cold, heartless
scientists that they are.

675
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:48,754
(Montenegro)
So, the footage
s pretty rough,

676
00:27:48,822 --> 00:27:50,823
as you saw, so I
ran an application

677
00:27:50,891 --> 00:27:53,125
to counteract the motion of the
camera with opposite movement.

678
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:56,529
Then I translated each pixel
of the infrared spectrum

679
00:27:56,597 --> 00:27:58,030
into a pixel

680
00:27:58,098 --> 00:27:59,398
of the visible color spectrum.

681
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:00,600
Okay.

682
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,134
Let's see it.

683
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:13,446
(Saroyan) Well, that's
a lot more terrestrial

684
00:28:13,514 --> 00:28:14,914
than I expected.

685
00:28:14,982 --> 00:28:17,817
Two tanker trucks,
some sort of digger.

686
00:28:20,354 --> 00:28:21,420
And this is a hose.

687
00:28:21,488 --> 00:28:22,822
What do you think, three inches?

688
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,458
That's the source
of the glowing liquid.

689
00:28:25,526 --> 00:28:27,960
Yeah, but what about
the alien things?

690
00:28:29,363 --> 00:28:30,930
<i>(Hodgins)
Fremontodendron
mexicanum.</i>

691
00:28:30,998 --> 00:28:32,565
It's Mexican flannelbush.

692
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:34,767
(Saroyan)
Weird, glowing liquid
in the Mexican desert,

693
00:28:34,835 --> 00:28:36,569
Hazmat suits.

694
00:28:36,637 --> 00:28:39,672
(Hodgins) Whoa! They must've been
dumping chemicals illegally.

695
00:28:41,675 --> 00:28:43,142
(Montenegro)
Oop, she fell.

696
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,311
(Saroyan)
That must've been where
she fractured her knees.

697
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:47,346
(Hodgins) Yeah, but she still
managed to get away.

698
00:28:47,414 --> 00:28:48,814
You guys see
what happened?

699
00:28:48,882 --> 00:28:50,883
She was out
looking for UFOs,

700
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:52,485
but found
this instead.

701
00:28:52,553 --> 00:28:53,920
These guys killed her.

702
00:28:53,987 --> 00:28:56,055
You know,
I think I liked this all better

703
00:28:56,123 --> 00:28:57,857
when it was aliens.

704
00:29:04,636 --> 00:29:06,637
So I was able to clarify the
chemiluminescent signature

705
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:08,538
of the materials being
dumped in the video.

706
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,341
Manganese
and sodium borohydride.

707
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:12,675
Used in the manufacture
of batteries.

708
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:14,978
Can you get a specific
manufacturer from that?

709
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,312
I did.

710
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,114
Innatron.

711
00:29:18,182 --> 00:29:21,017
Mexican flannelbush is on
the verge of extinction, right?

712
00:29:21,085 --> 00:29:23,453
Innatron has a plant located
smack-dab in the middle

713
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,321
of the last remaining
flannelbush population--

714
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,756
here in Juarez--

715
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:29,592
and they use manganese
and sodium borohydride.

716
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,160
Wow.

717
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,695
Hmm?

718
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,033
(chuckling)

719
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:52,782
(door closes)

720
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,018
Dr. Hodgins, I'm kind of
in the middle of...

721
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,653
You were right, Sweets.

722
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,521
Everything is not fine.

723
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,189
(sighs)

724
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,091
It's not fine at all.

725
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,427
This is a good time.

726
00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:08,097
Don't know if I want to crawl
into a hole and die or...

727
00:30:08,165 --> 00:30:10,433
run over Wendell and Angela
with a truck.

728
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:12,702
You know, it's natural
to have those feelings.

729
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,104
But I'm a better man than this.

730
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:17,607
I mean, I...
I want to be happy for them.

731
00:30:17,675 --> 00:30:19,375
You know, I really do.

732
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,778
Well, it's easier for us
to accept loneliness,

733
00:30:21,845 --> 00:30:25,515
as long as the person
we were once with is also alone.

734
00:30:25,582 --> 00:30:27,617
When she finds happiness
with someone else,

735
00:30:27,685 --> 00:30:30,119
oh, man, it's like being stabbed
in the heart.

736
00:30:30,187 --> 00:30:31,621
It's the human condition.

737
00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:33,823
You know, it's why there
are so many movies

738
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:35,692
and plays and songs and poems.

739
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:36,926
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah--
art, art.

740
00:30:36,994 --> 00:30:38,661
I get it.

741
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:40,463
What do I do?

742
00:30:40,531 --> 00:30:43,666
Well, first, you need
to figure out what you want.

743
00:30:43,734 --> 00:30:48,671
I want to not be filled
with anger and-and...

744
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:50,740
pain and resentment.

745
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,742
I don't want to be jealous.

746
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,877
Do you want Angela back?

747
00:30:58,716 --> 00:30:59,982
I don't think you're jealous.

748
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,518
I think that you're grieving

749
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:04,020
what you've lost.

750
00:31:04,088 --> 00:31:05,488
Grieving?

751
00:31:05,556 --> 00:31:06,756
As in grief?

752
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:08,057
Yes.

753
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:10,893
Oh, man, the only thing
that cures grief is time.

754
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:12,995
Unless you're recommending
a lot of alcohol.

755
00:31:13,063 --> 00:31:15,498
I can't really
recommend alcohol.

756
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:17,400
Man, that'd be great
if you could, though, right?

757
00:31:17,468 --> 00:31:18,701
(chuckling)

758
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:20,603
I recommend time.

759
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:24,707
So, just...
smile and act like a good guy?

760
00:31:25,743 --> 00:31:27,710
You are a good guy.

761
00:31:33,884 --> 00:31:35,752
You know, there was a time
that I thought

762
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:38,187
that Angela and I
would be together forever.

763
00:31:41,158 --> 00:31:42,825
Can I just sit here
for a minute?

764
00:31:42,893 --> 00:31:45,962
Yeah, take all
the time you need.

765
00:31:56,774 --> 00:31:59,108
There is nothing
in this video that indicates

766
00:31:59,176 --> 00:32:01,344
what kind of weapon
was used to kill the victim.

767
00:32:01,411 --> 00:32:02,578
Yeah. It's true.

768
00:32:02,646 --> 00:32:04,680
I doesn't look
like anybody's armed.

769
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:07,884
Now, I was able to salvage
some of the audio track.

770
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:10,353
(static hissing,
computer blipping)

771
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,021
That's just white noise.

772
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:13,389
Yeah, I know,

773
00:32:13,457 --> 00:32:15,258
but I scrubbed the background

774
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:17,126
and separated
the different frequencies,

775
00:32:17,194 --> 00:32:19,529
and then I amplified
the resulting file.

776
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:21,063
<i>(woman)
Yo estoy encargada.</i>

<i>te arrepentirás.</i>

779
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:25,935
That's Spanish.

780
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:27,203
Yeah. I know.

781
00:32:27,271 --> 00:32:28,905
We're going to have
to get a translator.

782
00:32:28,972 --> 00:32:31,174
No, I was a cop and
coroner in New York City,

783
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,408
so I speak some.

784
00:32:32,476 --> 00:32:34,076
Can you play that back?
Yeah.

785
00:32:34,144 --> 00:32:35,511
<i>Yo estoy encargada.</i>

786
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,113

00:32:42,486 --> 00:32:43,753
you'll regret it."

791
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:44,754
Hmm.

792
00:32:44,822 --> 00:32:46,389
<i>Yo estoy encargada.</i>

793
00:32:46,456 --> 00:32:48,024
She's not from Mexico, though.

794
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,358
You can tell that?

795
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,527
<i>The way she says "estoy"
and "arrepentirás."</i>

796
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,629
The Puerto Rican cops
used to make fun of me

797
00:32:53,697 --> 00:32:55,565
when I pronounced
my "T"s and "P"s like that.

798
00:32:55,632 --> 00:32:56,866
So, you think that...

799
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,367
Yeah.

800
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,436
The speaker is definitely
American.

801

<i>(Booth)
Ursula thought she was filming
a UFO crash site?</i>

802
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:07,109
But she ended up with footage

803
00:33:07,177 --> 00:33:09,912
of an American
dumping toxic waste

804
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,247
in the Mexican desert.

805
00:33:11,315 --> 00:33:12,515
Rachel Adams.

806
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:13,716
American?
Yes.

807
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:14,917
She's an Innatron executive,

808
00:33:14,985 --> 00:33:16,552
in charge of waste management.

809
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,588
She's based in Juarez, Mexico.

810
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:20,156
African-American.
Yes.

811
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:21,591
Well, the owner
of the diner said

812
00:33:21,658 --> 00:33:22,925
that the victim was seen arguing

813
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:24,427
with an African-American
businesswoman.

814
00:33:24,494 --> 00:33:25,828
Huh.

815
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,267
...so we put together
a range of weapons

816
00:33:31,335 --> 00:33:33,269
which might fire ball bearings

817
00:33:33,337 --> 00:33:35,271
at a velocity congruent
with the damage done

818
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:37,607
to the inside of our
victim's skull.

819
00:33:37,674 --> 00:33:40,276
Okay, we have
a paintball gun,

820
00:33:40,344 --> 00:33:43,279
an air rifle, a BB gun,
and a PVC pipe zip gun.

821
00:33:43,347 --> 00:33:44,480
Each modified

822
00:33:44,548 --> 00:33:49,452
to fire six 17.5-millimeter
ball bearings.

823
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,620
Melons lined with paraffin
and filled

824
00:33:50,687 --> 00:33:51,954
with dense agar gelatin,

825
00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:53,256
which mimics skull
and brain matter.

826
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,091
What's with
the faces?

827
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,026
Uh, yeah,

828
00:33:57,094 --> 00:33:58,227
we-- um,

829
00:33:58,295 --> 00:34:03,232
well, I guess, I--
kind of got inspired.

830
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,634
Inspired?

831
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:05,935
All right,

832
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:08,004
goggles, everyone.

833
00:34:13,277 --> 00:34:15,011
Ready?

834
00:34:15,078 --> 00:34:16,746
(shot fires,
ball bearings clattering)

835
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:18,414
All right. Okay.

836
00:34:18,482 --> 00:34:20,449
So, the paintball
gun ball bearing

837
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,485
didn't have enough force
to get through my skull.

838
00:34:22,552 --> 00:34:23,753
That's too bad.

839
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,221
(Bray)
I'm next.

840
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:26,255
Uh, uh-uh!

841
00:34:26,323 --> 00:34:27,957
I'll shoot you.

842
00:34:29,993 --> 00:34:32,361
(chuckling):
Whoa!

843
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,097
<i>That was way too much damage.</i>

844
00:34:35,165 --> 00:34:39,101
That blew your head
clear off.

845
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:41,637
I don't know if anyone should
enjoy their work this much.

846
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,072
Mmm.

847
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,075
You and Dr. Saroyan are
still in the running.

848
00:34:46,143 --> 00:34:48,144
Uh, I got it.

849
00:34:56,987 --> 00:34:58,955
Hmm.

850
00:34:59,022 --> 00:35:01,891
Not enough force to
kill Dr. Saroyan.

851
00:35:03,593 --> 00:35:05,528
(rattling)
Whoa!

852
00:35:05,595 --> 00:35:08,030
Angela, the balls are rattling,
but your head is still intact.

853
00:35:08,098 --> 00:35:10,399
Call that thing by my name
one more time.

854
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:11,801
I dare you.

855
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,971
It was a zip gun.
A perfect,

856
00:35:15,038 --> 00:35:18,007
untraceable, cheap weapon,
easily homemade.

857
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,709
That was fun.

858
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:21,177
Boys.

859
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,845
You got that right.

860
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:26,882
(chuckles)

861
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:33,789
Want to do it again?

862
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:39,028
I have an appointment,
Agent Booth,

863
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:41,063
I don't have to answer
your questions.

864
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:43,799
We follow all of the rules
set forth by the EPA

865
00:35:43,867 --> 00:35:45,901
and environmental restrictions
in the NAFTA treaty.

866
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:46,902
Right. On paper.

867
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,538
I resent that.
We have witnesses

868
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,540
at Roswell who said
that they saw you

869
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,576
arguing with the witness

870
00:35:53,643 --> 00:35:55,011
on the day that
she was murdered.

871
00:35:55,078 --> 00:35:57,346
Did your witness tell you
what we were arguing about?

872
00:35:57,414 --> 00:36:00,049
(clears throat)

873
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:03,085
(speaking Spanish)

874
00:36:03,153 --> 00:36:04,553
You were trying

875
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,555
to buy video footage
Ursula had taken of you

876
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,491
illegally dumping toxic waste.

877
00:36:08,558 --> 00:36:10,693
She thought she had
real footage of a UFO,

878
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:12,762
so, unfortunately for you,
she didn't give it up.

879
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,335
I work for a major corporation

880
00:36:19,403 --> 00:36:22,338
that's just signed a billion-
dollar deal with the Mexicans.

881
00:36:22,406 --> 00:36:25,041
You think you can extradite me?

882
00:36:25,108 --> 00:36:27,109
Take your best shot.

883
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:30,579
(car alarm chirps)

884
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:38,426
<i>(Brennan)
Here comes something.</i>

885
00:36:38,493 --> 00:36:39,460
(Booth)
What's it say?

886
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:41,963
It says that Innatron

887
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,333
contracts its waste disposal
to an independent contractor.

888
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,534
Is it owned
by a shell company?

889
00:36:46,602 --> 00:36:47,868
Mm-hmm.
Well...

890
00:36:47,936 --> 00:36:49,370
<i>Norte Domesticas, yes.</i>

891
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:50,671
Well, you know,
we'll get D.C. on it,

892
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:51,872
but I'm going to tell you
right now,

893
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,274
I already know who owns
that shell company.

894
00:36:53,342 --> 00:36:54,709
Rachel Adams?
Yep.

895
00:36:54,776 --> 00:36:55,943
Innatron pays the shell company

896
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:57,245
hundreds and thousands
of dollars

897
00:36:57,312 --> 00:36:59,447
to get rid of the waste,
and Rachel and her crew--

898
00:36:59,514 --> 00:37:01,782
they just dump it in the desert
and they pocket the money.

899
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,451
Well, Ursula Lapine thinks

900
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:05,786
she's photographing
extraterrestrial contact,

901
00:37:05,854 --> 00:37:08,122
they catch her,
she ends up dead.

902
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,758
Well, why would she turn down
the money in the diner,

903
00:37:10,826 --> 00:37:12,793
then agree to meet
out in the desert?

904
00:37:12,861 --> 00:37:15,763
Perhaps that's where they agreed
to swap the video for the money.

905
00:37:15,831 --> 00:37:17,932
I guess.

906
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,401
Oh, you say,
"Yeah, I guess," but you mean,

907
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:21,636
"I don't think so."

908
00:37:21,703 --> 00:37:23,170
Rachel lives in Juarez.

909
00:37:23,238 --> 00:37:26,674
I mean, she could get herself
an untraceable gun,

910
00:37:26,742 --> 00:37:28,409
what, in like 15 minutes?

911
00:37:28,477 --> 00:37:30,444
Instead, she shows up
with a homemade zip gun?

912
00:37:30,512 --> 00:37:31,679
That doesn't make sense.

913
00:37:31,747 --> 00:37:32,713
Right?

914
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:34,715
(phone rings)

915
00:37:34,783 --> 00:37:36,217
Hodgins.

916
00:37:36,285 --> 00:37:38,719
Hodgins...
Oh, hey, Dr. Brennan.

917
00:37:38,787 --> 00:37:40,187
No, Hodgins, it's not me.

918
00:37:40,255 --> 00:37:41,689
It's Booth.
Okay, listen.

919
00:37:41,757 --> 00:37:43,658
Hodgins, could we just focus
on the ball bearings?

920
00:37:43,725 --> 00:37:45,326
Yeah. What about them?
Could you trace them

921
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:46,961
to Innatron?
No.

922
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:48,429
Well, how can you be so sure?

923
00:37:48,497 --> 00:37:49,830
Because they're obsolete.

924
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:52,300
They were manufactured
in the '40s and the '50s.

925
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:53,734
For what?
Roller skates,

926
00:37:53,802 --> 00:37:56,470
fishing reels, yo-yos,
turntables.

927
00:37:56,538 --> 00:37:58,506
Toys?!

928
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,879
Hey, I'm just closing up.

929
00:38:04,946 --> 00:38:07,114
I turned off the grill
about a half an hour ago.

930
00:38:07,182 --> 00:38:09,183
Oh, we, uh...
No, we're not here to eat,
Blaine.

931
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:11,118
Any of these work back here?

932
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:12,320
BLAINE:
Yeah.

933
00:38:12,387 --> 00:38:14,722
<i>The disruptor there
from Gamma-Gamma Six.</i>

934
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,090
Why isn't this
solar system working?

935
00:38:16,158 --> 00:38:17,358
'Cause it's 60
years old.

936
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:18,859
What-What is with you people?

937
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:20,861
Well, we, uh...
You overheard Rachel

938
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:23,030
offering Ursula payoff money,
didn't you, Blaine?

939
00:38:23,098 --> 00:38:25,833
BLAINE:
What? No. I didn't.

940
00:38:25,901 --> 00:38:27,635
You told us you had to ask them
to keep it down.

941
00:38:27,703 --> 00:38:29,303
How come you don't
interrupt Bones?

942
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:30,738
I'm a gentlemen.
How much did you...

943
00:38:30,806 --> 00:38:32,106
How much did
Rachel offer?

944
00:38:32,174 --> 00:38:33,341
Ten grand? 20?

945
00:38:33,408 --> 00:38:34,875
But Ursula thought

946
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:36,877
that she had proof
of alien life.

947
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:38,913
How much did she ask for?
A million bucks?

948
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,148
Hey, you can't just take stuff
like that.

949
00:38:41,216 --> 00:38:42,283
You need a warrant.

950
00:38:42,351 --> 00:38:43,351
I'll get a warrant.
Oh, no, no, no.

951
00:38:43,418 --> 00:38:44,552
We don't need a warrant.

952
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:46,087
We're just playing.

953
00:38:46,154 --> 00:38:47,488
Yeah, like the
sign says.

954
00:38:47,556 --> 00:38:48,723
I figure what happens

955
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,324
is you told Ursula
you could get her millions.

956
00:38:50,392 --> 00:38:52,226
You arranged to...
Yeah, you arranged to meet

957
00:38:52,294 --> 00:38:53,828
out in the desert,
told her to bring the video,

958
00:38:53,895 --> 00:38:55,863
you'd bring the buyer.
He's trying to take your credit.

959
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:57,198
Eh, he's just talkative.

960
00:38:57,265 --> 00:38:59,333
Can you hand me those ball
bearings there, will you?

961
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:01,402
Look at that.

962
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,704
They seem to fit perfectly.
Come on,

963
00:39:03,772 --> 00:39:05,539
that's just a toy-- you couldn't
hurt a flea with that.

964
00:39:06,942 --> 00:39:07,942
(Brennan)
Oh!
Oh!

965
00:39:10,145 --> 00:39:12,780
Yes, that would be
the murder weapon.

966
00:39:14,649 --> 00:39:16,250
Hey, hey, I got my rights.

967
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:19,220
You got the right to shut
the hell up, Blaine.

968
00:39:19,287 --> 00:39:21,255
Killing that poor crazy woman
for her video.

969
00:39:21,323 --> 00:39:22,923
Yeah, by the way,
that video,

970
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:24,458
it was hid down her throat
on a thread

971
00:39:24,526 --> 00:39:26,060
of dental floss,

972
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:27,328
you moron.

973
00:39:27,396 --> 00:39:28,529
He is a moron.

974
00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:30,064
You are definitely
a moron!

975
00:39:30,132 --> 00:39:33,067
Well, not literally,
figuratively.

976
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:36,070
It's very satisfying to use
an insulting colloquialism

977
00:39:36,138 --> 00:39:37,571
even when it isn't accurate.

978
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,873
Right, it's even better
when they resist arrest

979
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,940
and you get to hit them.

980
00:39:40,008 --> 00:39:42,009
I don't know.
Yeah, I think so.

981
00:39:49,684 --> 00:39:51,619
So, do you feel better?

982
00:39:51,686 --> 00:39:53,621
Being open about
our relationship?

983
00:39:53,688 --> 00:39:55,055
Yeah.
Yeah, you bet.

984
00:39:55,123 --> 00:39:57,892
You know, it's over
between Hodgins and me.

985
00:39:57,959 --> 00:39:59,927
I mean, you believe
that now, right?

986
00:39:59,995 --> 00:40:03,264
I think everything is always
more complicated than it looks.

987
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:07,601
I am telling you,
mister, it's not.

988
00:40:07,669 --> 00:40:11,038
Like Dr. Brennan says:

989
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:13,040
no use jumping to conclusions

990
00:40:13,108 --> 00:40:15,109
before all the evidence is in.

991
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,201
Quite a show, huh?

992
00:40:40,268 --> 00:40:41,869
Shouldn't we get
going home?

993
00:40:41,937 --> 00:40:43,704
Come on, Bones, how many times
do you get a chance

994
00:40:43,772 --> 00:40:44,972
to check out a
desert sky?

995
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,007
I've been in the desert
many times.

996
00:40:47,075 --> 00:40:50,010
Though, usually
I'm digging in the ground,

997
00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:52,012
not looking up.

998
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,315
Now's your chance
to look up.

999
00:40:54,382 --> 00:40:57,351
So, look up.

1000
00:40:57,419 --> 00:40:58,686
But it's ridiculous
to think

1001
00:40:58,753 --> 00:41:01,355
there's anything on this planet
worth seeing

1002
00:41:01,423 --> 00:41:03,357
which merits crossing

1003
00:41:03,425 --> 00:41:06,360
what are literally
astronomical distances.

1004
00:41:08,396 --> 00:41:12,466
Maybe aliens are
anthropologists?

1005
00:41:12,534 --> 00:41:16,003
Maybe they just want to
study our religion

1006
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:19,540
and sex and... love

1007
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:22,676
and our funny languages
and line dancing?

1008
00:41:22,744 --> 00:41:25,646
That's an interesting
possibility I hadn't considered.

1009
00:41:25,714 --> 00:41:28,482
Well, living creatures, they
like to reach out, Bones.

1010
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,651
Living creatures
like to reach out
and eat each other.

1011
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:32,686
Oh, so what are
you saying,

1012
00:41:32,754 --> 00:41:34,622
that the aliens just
want to come down here

1013
00:41:34,689 --> 00:41:36,657
and drink our
spinal fluid?

1014
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:38,659
Well, if the aliens
are advanced enough

1015
00:41:38,727 --> 00:41:41,662
to fly faster than light,

1016
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:44,565
then they can probably
make spinal fluid.

1017
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:46,600
Oh, you just said that
aliens are nice.

1018
00:41:46,668 --> 00:41:48,502
I did not.

1019
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,703
You just basically said

1020
00:41:49,771 --> 00:41:52,573
that aliens are nice
anthropologists.

1021
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:53,841
I don't think so.

1022
00:41:53,909 --> 00:41:57,545
You think the aliens
are you.

1023
00:41:57,612 --> 00:41:58,279
(laughs)

1024
00:41:58,346 --> 00:41:59,547
You got me.

1025
00:41:59,614 --> 00:42:01,482
You know, I-I--
I'm one of them.

1026
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,718
I knew it.
I was sent down
as an advance scout.

1027
00:42:04,786 --> 00:42:06,554
(laughs)
I knew it.

1028
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:08,389
No probing.
No probing!
(laughs)

1029
00:42:08,456 --> 00:42:11,392
Hey, probing is a valuable way
to gather information.

1030
00:42:11,459 --> 00:42:14,962
We know how you people
like to probe... right.

1031
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,997
Did you hear that?

1032
00:42:20,635 --> 00:42:22,303
What was it?

1033
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,141
What's that mean?

1034
00:42:27,242 --> 00:42:30,142

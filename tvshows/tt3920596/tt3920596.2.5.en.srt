1
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:08,804
What exactly
does your mother-in-law know?

2
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:13,040
- What's all this?
- The photoshoot.

3
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:14,146
Women in Power.

4
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:15,968
People file for bankruptcy
all the time.

5
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:18,673
There will come a day
that you will pay for this.

6
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,337
If there was a problem with us,
why couldn't you come

7
00:00:21,425 --> 00:00:23,259
straight at me
like you go at everyone else?

8
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:27,165
What do you think about going
to a couple's workshop?

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,827
I saw you
with your friends.

10
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:32,578
Something's wrong,
and I don't like the energy

11
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,221
- around you.
- What... Oh my God!

12
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:37,072
Mom! Oh my God!
What's happening to her?

13
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:40,266
I'm worried about the boys.

14
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:41,305
They're at risk here.

15
00:00:41,393 --> 00:00:43,314
My boys will not be going
to live with you.

16
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:44,915
You're a mess.

I pushed him.

00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:43,536
Listen to me! Listen to me!

40
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:44,997
I pushed him.

41
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:50,646
Nobody did this! Nobody!

42
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,755
Help! Somebody!

43
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,333
Fuck.

44
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:37,302
Hey, Ed!
Ed! Hold on, man. Hey.

45
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,286
Hey. Listen, man.

46
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:45,536
I'm sorry...
for the whole party thing.

47
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:47,630
Yeah, I overreacted.

48
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:50,716
You know what?
I don't believe you.

49
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:52,786
- What?
- That you're sorry.

50
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:55,560
Why do you have to be
such a fuck?

51
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:58,528
Well, I don't
have to be. I choose to be.

52
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:01,724
See, not everybody gets along,
Nathan. I mean,

53
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,036
can't we just be comfortable
not liking each other?

54
00:04:05,153 --> 00:04:06,786
Doesn't have to be a reason.

55
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,030
This whole fucking world's
lost its mind.

56
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:18,216
This whole fucking planet
is inhabited by nutfucks!

57
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:20,372
Hey, nutfuck!

58
00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:30,558
Basically,
this is child custody.

59
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,855
We will set a hearing.
Between now and then,

60
00:04:32,943 --> 00:04:34,719
I will appoint
a psychiatric investigator.

61
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:37,389
He or she will interview
the parties, the children,

62
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:39,019
your associates, your friends,

63
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:41,698
anybody and everybody
he or she deems necessary

64
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:44,179
to making a recommendation
to the court.

65
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,675
In the end, it will come down
to my judgement

66
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:49,893
whether there's been behavior
detrimental to the children.

67
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:51,943
Any questions so far?

68
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:53,362
May I be heard, Your Honor?

69
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:54,769
Very well.

70
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:57,263
I do not
consider Celeste Wright

71
00:04:57,343 --> 00:04:59,503
- to be a bad person.
- Good to know.

72
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,013
She's been a wonderful mother
to the boys.

73
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,013
- Mary Louise.
- And I don't have any reason to doubt...

74
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:06,503
- her ongoing commitment to them.
- Okay.

75
00:05:06,591 --> 00:05:09,208
- So what are we doing here?
- That said...

76
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:10,716
she's not well.

77
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:12,434
- All right.
- It's true.

78
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:14,272
This isn't the time,
Mrs. Wright.

79
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,623
Well, then you understand.

80
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,232
This is not a case of
angry mother-in-law on the loose

81
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,106
- or something. Rather it's as
- Come on. So unfair.

82
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:21,458
You suggest...

83
00:05:21,593 --> 00:05:24,763
we have to do what is best
for the children.

84
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:27,287
All right,
we will take this up at another time.

85
00:05:27,374 --> 00:05:28,647
- This is inappropriate.
- We're good.

86
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:30,122
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you very much.

87
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,171
Thank you.
We will see you at the hearing.

88
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,745
How do we not respond to that?

89
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,881
- 'Cause we don't.
- You're a lawyer, Celeste.

90
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:38,496
- But we should have. She gets to make
- You know how this goes.

91
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,709
A sympathetic first impression,

92
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:41,595
and what,
I just sit there silent?

93
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:43,268
Which, in the face
of an accusation,

94
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:46,058
can be deemed an admission
of fucking guilt.

95
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:47,933
The judge won't see it that way.

96
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:51,481
She's after my kids!

97
00:05:51,763 --> 00:05:53,628
That's exactly
the type of flare up

98
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:55,096
they'll be looking to provoke.

99
00:05:55,263 --> 00:05:56,803
- Okay?
- God!

100
00:05:57,932 --> 00:05:59,839
She gets to make
an opening statement,

101
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:03,253
and you did nothing.
I didn't hire you to do nothing.

102
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:05,301
Please.

103
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:06,778
Because nothing...

104
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:09,513
was exactly the right
response, Celeste.

105
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:11,643
We have a very smart judge
in there.

106
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:13,227
One who will be able
to see through

107
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:14,962
your mother-in-law's
little performance

108
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,026
and see it for what it was.
Just a performance.

109
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:19,729
And I told you,
I am not about

110
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:21,051
putting up that kind
of performance.

111
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:22,792
I'm about credibility.

112
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,036
So when I speak, judges listen.

113
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:30,358
And now I need you to listen.

114
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:34,942
They don't win here unless
they establish you as unhinged.

115
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:38,593
So you should expect everything
and anything they do say

116
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:41,981
to be precisely designed
to get you to react.

117
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:45,286
We will not give them that.

118
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:13,531
Mom.

119
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:20,843
- Hi! What a nice surprise.
- Hi.

120
00:07:22,737 --> 00:07:25,718
- Where's Dad?
- Outside with Grandpa.

121
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,199
Is she getting better?

122
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:34,452
A little.
Still can't talk, though.

123
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:40,311
Today's gym, right?
Got all your stuff?

124
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,591
Yeah.

125
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,968
Oh, I miss you.

126
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:47,427
There's a surprise for you
at home.

127
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:49,507
- Shh! Hey, hey. What?
- Oh, yeah?

128
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:52,218
- Okay.
- All right.

129
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,015
Time to go, big girl.

130
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,726
- Pit stop's over.
- Okay.

131
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:05,523
Bye, Grandma.

132
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,020
Love you, baby.

133
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:11,999
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Bye. I love you.

134
00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:14,356
- Bye, Grandpa.
- Bye.

135
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:33,938
The most important thing

136
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:35,445
is that you remain open-minded.

137
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:38,095
You know, really open
to new theories...

138
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:40,101
This isn't gonna be like
wife-swapping, is it?

139
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:43,609
No! This is a healing institute.

140
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:46,109
Not a swinger's convention.

141
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:48,817
Please have an open mind.
Please?

142
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:50,145
I'm in the car.

143
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:53,146

I couldn't believe it.

153
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,395
I sat there,
and I didn't say anything.

154
00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:23,893
But Katie seems to think
that's the right thing to do,

155
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:25,321
and I'm not thinking straight.

156
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:26,806
- Yeah, no, I know.
- I'm just not.

157
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:28,467
This is disgusting.
I mean, honestly,

158
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:30,469
I wanna sit down
with Mary Louise.

159
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,433
Well... I don't think that
that would help, so...

160
00:09:33,513 --> 00:09:38,201
I don't know, Celeste.
Listen, don't... get me wrong,

161
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:41,223
but, um,
you're an attorney yourself,

162
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:44,593
and we gotta just say it:
lawyers fuck things up often.

163
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:48,093
And that's why I wanted to ask
you about Katie.

164
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:49,251
Well, what about her?

165
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,458
Well, I mean, is she...

166
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,047
is she as good as people say?

167
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:56,093
Well, she's good
because of this.

168
00:09:56,183 --> 00:09:58,893
It's a very different kind
of skill set,

169
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,524
and judges in family court

170
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:01,914
- don't like bulldogs.
- Yeah.

171
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:04,322
And so I think
given that, she's good.

172
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:06,873
I mean... I think
the straightest line

173
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:09,873
to get this resolved is just
to have Mary Louise call it off.

174
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:11,829
- No, she's not gonna do that.
- Hmm...

175
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:13,789
- She's not.
- She might.

176
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:16,014
Honey,
I need to take a crack at her.

177
00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:18,116
- Okay? This is what I do.
- Renata. Yeah.

178
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:19,726
- We're in a meeting.
- Renata...

179
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:22,076
I'm so sorry. I just got a call

180
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,514
from Suzie Jenkins,
San Francisco Magazine,

181
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:26,914
and, please don't shoot
the messenger...

182
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:30,204
they are not going
to include you...

183
00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:33,839
in the "Women in Power" piece.

184
00:10:36,662 --> 00:10:38,519
I'm... I'm sorry?

185
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:41,777
- Did she say why?
- Um...

186
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:44,574
The bankruptcy thing.

187
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:46,468
Listen, I can step out.

188
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:49,353
No, no, my God, no. No. No!
Stay right there.

189
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,032
They said it's not
the story that they're telling.

190
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:56,144
She just said the focus
is women on top.

191
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,532
I'm... I'm so sorry.

192
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:02,104
No, I mean, my God,
it's not your fault.

193
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:03,293
I know, I just
feel terrible because...

194
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,820
I said it's not your fault!

195
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:07,492
Can you excuse us?

196
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:09,702
I can make you
some Africa Zimbabwe tea...

197
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:11,152
If you just stop talking.

198
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:12,903
Okay, I'm gonna go away.

199
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:14,956
That would be best.

200
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:17,912
Are you okay?

201
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:20,562
I am not okay, Celeste.

202
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,841
Well, I mean it's just
a magazine article...

203
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:25,742
It's not just a magazine.
It's "Women in Power"!

204
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,341
I mean, we're supposed to be
on each other's side,

205
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,257
and they're backstabbing sluts!

206
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:40,202
"Ziggy." That's a dumb ass name.

207
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:42,015
My brother knows about you.

208
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:45,116
He said you have a hot mom.
Is that true?

209
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:48,265
You know you're
a mistake, right?

210
00:11:50,648 --> 00:11:53,663
Come on, pussy boy.
Say something.

211
00:11:58,322 --> 00:11:59,599
What's going on?

212
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:00,992
Beat it. I'm talking to someone.

213
00:12:01,072 --> 00:12:02,632
Leave my brother alone.

214
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:05,749
He's your brother?
That means your dad's a rapist.

215
00:12:06,112 --> 00:12:08,322
- Get the hell outta here!
- Make me.

216
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:26,357
His name is Brian McPherson.

217
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:30,044
He is... a bit difficult,
and he has bullied others.

218
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:31,567
But that being said,
he's the one

219
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:33,451
sitting in the hospital
getting his lip stitched up.

220
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:35,085
Oh my God...

221
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,805
- I'm suspending all four boys.
- What?

222
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:41,106
It's... just three days.
While we investigate...

223
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,639
Investigate?
Why didn't you do that first?

224
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:44,380
Jane. It was three against one.

225
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:46,773
The boy got hurt.
My hands are tied.

226
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:55,249
<i>♪ After school is over
You're playing in the park ♪</i>

227
00:12:56,072 --> 00:12:58,072
<i>♪ But don't be out
Too late... ♪</i>

228
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,069
You need to tell me
what he said to you.

229
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,489
Hey, uh-uh. Look at me.
What did he say?

230
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:06,734
- I told you. I can't remember.
- Ziggy.

231
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,257
He said my father's a rapist.

232
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:49,822
<i>Answer me!</i>

233
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,280
I'll take over.

234
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:34,452
Okay.

235
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:38,773
- I'll see you later.
- See ya.

236
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:43,662
Be open-minded, okay?

237
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:46,192
- Look at the view!
- It is pretty.

238
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,072
And they have a fireplace!

239
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,780
So, you're gonna
wander the space.

240
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:53,185
We're not moving in a circle.
We're exploring the space,

241
00:14:53,273 --> 00:14:55,974
and when you come face-to-face
with someone you'd like to hug,

242
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,200
give them a hug
for about the length

243
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:02,163
of a nice inhale, exhale.
Okay?

244
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,288
Good.

245
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:17,734
Thank you.

246
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,007
Oh my God!

247
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:24,562
That was awful. I'm so sorry.

248
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:29,124
Thank you for
at least agreeing to try.

249
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:35,538
You're a really good man.
Good husband, good father.

250
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:39,468
I was a sound choice.

251
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:43,032
What are you saying?

252
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,952
What?
What are you trying to say?

253
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:46,632
I've said it many times,

254
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,351
- Madeline.
- Well, saying it one more time

255
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:50,271
is not going to kill you, is it?

256
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:54,952
Nathan broke your world,
which at its core, is family.

257
00:15:55,077 --> 00:15:56,850
- You've said it many times.
- I know.

258
00:15:56,937 --> 00:15:58,224
I've said it many, many times.

259
00:15:58,312 --> 00:15:59,591
Is it a fucking crime?

260
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,155
I didn't say
it was a fucking crime.

261
00:16:02,835 --> 00:16:05,044
Okay, then
what are you trying to say to me?

262
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:07,849
Please, just tell me.
I-I have no idea.

263
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:11,702
On our first dates, it was like
you were interviewing me.

264
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:16,864
Not so much
for the soulmate position

265
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:18,741
or... lover.

266
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:23,780
But rather, father.
The stable provider.

267
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:27,509
Abigail was ripped apart and...

268
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,572
you were determined to fix that.

269
00:16:29,898 --> 00:16:34,093
To not make the mistake of
going down the lust path again.

270
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:38,782
You had a certain criteria,
and I checked all the boxes.

271
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:44,572
So... you made the sound,
practical choice.

272
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:47,765
It's not something I couldn't
make peace with. I did.

273
00:16:48,912 --> 00:16:52,132
But then you got unsound.

274
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:55,492
You decided to make
impractical choices,

275
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,989
one being to fuck
Joseph Bachman, which left me

276
00:17:00,077 --> 00:17:02,429
with the most difficult choice
of all:

277
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:05,771
to walk out with my dignity
or to stay with a woman

278
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,257
who I simply cannot trust.

279
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,655
You can trust me to love you.

280
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:26,304
More deeply than
I've ever loved anybody.

281
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:31,319
Can you trust me
not to fuck things up again?

282
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:33,359
Maybe not.

283
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:37,124
I don't know
if I can trust myself with that.

284
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:41,648
I didn't trust
my parents' marriage, and...

285
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,491
the one I had with Nathan
was not to be believed.

286
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:49,741
And I... I don't know what it is,
and I don't...

287
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:53,317
Maybe it's some unconscious
preemptive thing

288
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,710
where I wanna be the destroyer,
not the destroyee.

289
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:01,655
I don't understand, and I racked
my brain about it, but I...

290
00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:07,773
'Cause all I really want
is to be married to you.

291
00:18:10,662 --> 00:18:12,913
Just... happily married to you.

292
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:16,282
But I must have low self-esteem

293
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,152
or I fucking hate myself
or something

294
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,819
because look what I've done.

295
00:18:22,382 --> 00:18:25,226
If I fuck up again,
it will not be with infidelity.

296
00:18:25,862 --> 00:18:27,280
I give you my word.

297
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:31,913
All my future mistakes
will be brand new ones.

298
00:18:41,046 --> 00:18:43,075
They said
it was ultimately a smear

299
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:47,882
on the entire publication
if I was in this article.

300
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,132
I'm sorry. That sucks.

301
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:58,614
You know, it might actually
be for the best.

302
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:01,202
- What?
- I...

303
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,690
The article would have put
a target right on your back.

304
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:06,782
I've spent my entire life
with a bullseye on my back.

305
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:08,822
This is one I wanted.

306
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:12,241
It's for me.

307
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:13,782
Coming!

308
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,108
- Mary Louise!
- Oh. Hellow!

309
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:19,322
Hi.
Thank you so much for coming.

310
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,067
- Oh, thank you.
- Pleasure's mine.

311
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:24,059
I don't often get invited
for tea in this neck.

312
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:26,184
Well, please. Please.

313
00:19:26,272 --> 00:19:29,749
Um, what kind of tea
would you like?

314
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:33,210
Again, I just... I wanna say
I really appreciate you coming

315
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:36,843
because, um, I know
there's a lot going on,

316
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:39,608
and, uh, it must be so...

317
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:41,382
- unbearably difficult.
- It is.

318
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,960
Thank you for...

319
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:45,822
for understanding that.

320
00:19:46,116 --> 00:19:48,091
Of course. My God.
And listen,

321
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:49,999
just between you and me,
I did want us...

322
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:52,772
Hmm. I was hoping this would
just be about...

323
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,187
tea, but...

324
00:19:56,515 --> 00:19:59,468
people don't do that anymore.
Do they?

325
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:03,282
Uh, do what?

326
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,782
Just enjoy each other's company.

327
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:09,152
Just... no agenda.
It would be so nice...

328
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:13,072
if people could just
be together, you know. But...

329
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,163
maybe somebody
will invent an app for that.

330
00:20:16,331 --> 00:20:19,501
Well, um... can I...

331
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,236
talk to you?
Just... mother to mother.

332
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:26,702
I would like that.

333
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:28,788
Great. Uh, in thinking about

334
00:20:28,876 --> 00:20:31,310
- everything that's going on...
- What happened to your furniture?

335
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,075
I mean, it's such a big house,

336
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:35,282
you'd think there would be
a lot of furniture.

337
00:20:35,421 --> 00:20:36,817
Well, we're going through

338
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:38,684
a little bankruptcy
thing right now,

339
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:42,132
- which is almost resolved. But...
- Oh, that sounds awful.

340
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:44,612
But you work, don't you, Renata?

341
00:20:44,772 --> 00:20:47,062
- I do. Yes.
- Yeah.

342
00:20:48,242 --> 00:20:50,770
That must be
especially devastating,

343
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:53,913
for a working mom to lose
her house, her belongings,

344
00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:57,819
because just to think about
the sacrifice...

345
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,942
You know, all the missed dinners
with kids,

346
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,612
and the not being able to host
the after-school play dates,

347
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:07,702
there's just so many,
many moments lost.

348
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:09,402
And for what?

349
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:10,939
A screening room.

350
00:21:11,851 --> 00:21:13,444
Maybe a boat.

351
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:16,757
Sorry.

352
00:21:18,072 --> 00:21:20,520
You were saying s...
Oh. Mother to mother?

353
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:23,538
Are you placing judgment
on my life choices?

354
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:27,155
I don't know your life choices.
I don't know you,

355
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:29,171
other than you're a friend
of Celeste,

356
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:31,991
and you seem like
a very nice person

357
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,687
who lives in a big house
with no furniture.

358
00:21:39,742 --> 00:21:41,530
This is a serious situation,

359
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:42,749
and the boy needed stitches,

360
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:45,207
- so I need to know.
- Who instigated the fight?

361
00:21:45,452 --> 00:21:47,187
Was it you, Max?

362
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,862
- Was it?
- He was saying stuff about Dad.

363
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:52,007
And he was picking on Ziggy.

364
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:53,944
So what?

365
00:21:54,476 --> 00:21:55,888
So the three of you
attacked him?

366
00:21:55,976 --> 00:21:57,612
You ganged up on him?

367
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:01,452
You can't do that.
Violence is not the answer.

368
00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:03,890
Look at me. You think it is?

369
00:22:09,312 --> 00:22:11,912
What? Why are you looking at me
like that?

370
00:22:11,992 --> 00:22:13,282
Stop being such a bitch.

371
00:22:13,362 --> 00:22:16,152
Don't talk to me like that!

372
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,046
You do not talk to me like that!

373
00:22:21,318 --> 00:22:22,614
Come he... Stop it!

374
00:22:22,702 --> 00:22:24,421
You can't talk to your mother
like that.

375
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,139
You can't talk to me like that.

376
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,530
Do you understand me?

377
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:32,694
It's not right.

378
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:51,757
I have an appointment tonight.

379
00:22:51,858 --> 00:22:54,223
Kelly's gonna be here
in a minute to sit.

380
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:56,021
What kind of appointment?

381
00:22:58,152 --> 00:22:59,960
Oh, um...

382
00:23:03,242 --> 00:23:04,694
with a lawyer.

383
00:23:08,726 --> 00:23:10,318
Your grandmother thinks
it would be better

384
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:13,072
if... if you lived with her
for a little while,

385
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,226
and I... I disagree,
and it's...

386
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,681
Why does she think that?

387
00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:22,572
Because I... I don't know.

388
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:24,239
We're not gonna
live here anymore?

389
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:26,782
No, you're absolutely
gonna live here.

390
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,552
We have to have a judge decide,

391
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,152
and that's what I have to go
and do tonight.

392
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:33,524
I don't want to live
with Grandma.

393
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:35,247
I don't want you to live
with Grandma,

394
00:23:35,335 --> 00:23:38,843
and you're not going to.
You will be living here.

395
00:23:41,242 --> 00:23:46,038
All right? You will absolutely
be living here.

Singing for sleep apnea.

416

Stanford Sleep Clinic.
They diagnose everyone.

The class is a cash cow.
What's up?

Well, um...

419
00:25:25,572 --> 00:25:26,912
About your mother...

420
00:25:27,305 --> 00:25:29,362
I think we need to get her out
of this hospital.

421
00:25:29,524 --> 00:25:31,399
Aren't they moving her to rehab?

422
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:33,476
Which basically means
they're throwing their hands up.

423
00:25:33,563 --> 00:25:34,812
They don't think
she'll get better?

424
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:36,290
We need to do something.

425
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:40,743
Look at you getting involved.
Wow.

426
00:25:42,354 --> 00:25:43,594
I gotta go.

427
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:46,242
Dad.

428
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,398
You don't think I got involved?

429
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:51,460
That I didn't protect you?

430
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:54,662
- No, Dad. I don't.
- If you only Goddamn knew.

431
00:25:54,742 --> 00:25:57,867
I do Goddamn know.
I was there.

432
00:25:59,072 --> 00:26:00,841
Did you diffuse things? Sure.

433
00:26:00,931 --> 00:26:03,279
Did you stop shit
from getting worse? Sometimes.

434
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:05,312

436

Well, thank you
for agreeing to meet.

437
00:26:20,755 --> 00:26:22,203
I'll get right to the point.

438
00:26:23,532 --> 00:26:26,857
There are only losers
in procedures like these,

439
00:26:26,945 --> 00:26:30,862
and the biggest ones,
invariably, being the children.

440
00:26:31,093 --> 00:26:34,612
So, my suggestion is that
we agree to joint custody,

441
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,820
- one where...
- No.

442
00:26:35,912 --> 00:26:37,115
- Just hear me out, please.
- No.

443
00:26:37,202 --> 00:26:38,452
- Hear me out. Hear me out.
- No.

444
00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:40,782
One where...
weekdays with you...

445
00:26:40,862 --> 00:26:42,282
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Hear me out.

446
00:26:42,362 --> 00:26:43,742
- No, just hear me out.
- No.

447
00:26:43,822 --> 00:26:44,882
Weekdays with you.

448
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,574
Weekends with my client,
Saturdays and Sundays.

449
00:26:47,662 --> 00:26:49,287
- What?
- You agree to seek treatment

450
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:52,452
for drug and alcohol dependency
as well as anger management.

451
00:26:52,726 --> 00:26:54,882
- Fuck you.
- Well, there you go.

452
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:57,242
These things will come up,
Mrs. Wright.

453
00:26:57,546 --> 00:27:00,359
- Is that a threat?
- That's a fact.

454
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:05,187
You. You're not getting my boys.

455
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:06,960
Not for a Saturday.
Not for a Sunday.

456
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:09,040
Not for a fucking minute.

457
00:27:09,384 --> 00:27:12,210
Did you really expect me
to accept this?

458
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:15,532
How are the boys doing?

459
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:18,429
You know, we don't
want this to go to court.

460
00:27:20,944 --> 00:27:22,875
There will be no joint custody.

461
00:27:24,304 --> 00:27:27,024
I see silence continues
to be your weapon of choice.

462
00:27:27,218 --> 00:27:29,032
Exactly what
am I paying you for?

463
00:27:29,112 --> 00:27:31,755
- It was actually a decent offer.
- No.

464
00:27:31,843 --> 00:27:33,311
There are so many possibilities

465
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:35,152
should this go to court,
Celeste...

466
00:27:35,476 --> 00:27:37,328
a lot of them bad.

467
00:27:39,835 --> 00:27:41,854
- You said we should win.
- We should.

468
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,396
But we could also lose.
The offer we just got

469
00:27:44,484 --> 00:27:47,640
- is a win in my opinion.
- Oh God!

470
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,571
There's also...

471
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,110
What?

472
00:27:54,642 --> 00:27:56,851
- What?
- Your husband's death.

473
00:27:58,646 --> 00:27:59,953
It will come up.

474
00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:07,320
Shit.

475
00:28:13,282 --> 00:28:15,445
There's gonna be
a guardianship hearing.

476
00:28:15,554 --> 00:28:17,138
I'm gonna have to testify,

477
00:28:17,226 --> 00:28:19,202
and that means
that I'm fair game.

478
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:21,402
- On everything.
- Fuck, you're right.

479
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,654
And Katie
is pretty much convinced

480
00:28:23,742 --> 00:28:25,982
that Farber is getting help
from the police.

481
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,226
- She is?
- What? - Jesus Christ.

482
00:28:29,054 --> 00:28:30,422
- So, basically... and...
- Oh my God.

483
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:31,898
He's an agent for them,

484
00:28:31,986 --> 00:28:34,138
and I suppose
they can ask me anything.

485
00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:35,539
- Under oath.
- Yeah.

486
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:37,342
- Oh my God.
- And if I get caught in like,

487
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,742
a lie or something,
then they have a case.

488
00:28:39,874 --> 00:28:41,396
Can you just plead the Fifth?

489
00:28:41,484 --> 00:28:43,782
No, I'll lose my kids,
Madeline.

490
00:28:43,862 --> 00:28:45,273
That's true.

491
00:28:46,032 --> 00:28:48,341
And they have
this witness list with you.

492
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:50,060
You are all on the list.

493
00:28:50,148 --> 00:28:52,404
But why would they
call us? We're on your side.

494
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:55,546
Madeline, please.
It's a fucking perjury trap.

495
00:28:55,773 --> 00:28:58,115
That's what they would do.
They'd call us to the stand

496
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,032
to testify to Celeste's fitness.

497
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:01,888
- Yeah...
- Then under oath, they say,

498
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:02,952
"Oh, by the way,

499
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,365
how did Perry Wright
fall down the stairs?"

500
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:05,296
- No.
- Yes.

501
00:29:05,384 --> 00:29:06,609
- Can they do that?
- Yes.

502
00:29:06,697 --> 00:29:08,524
Okay, but then we just stick
with our story.

503
00:29:08,612 --> 00:29:10,226
That's perjury, babe.

504
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,327
Okay, but they'd have to prove
we were lying. They can't...

505
00:29:12,414 --> 00:29:13,822
They probably can.

506
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:15,492
What if they can?

507
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,273
I'm just telling you this
because we have to be prepared.

508
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,492
Look, we have to stick together.

509
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,625
That's the only way
we've gotten this far.

510
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,148
If we stick together,
we'll be fine.

511
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,288
We're gonna be fine.

512
00:29:37,203 --> 00:29:40,296
Thank you again.
He really likes you.

513
00:29:40,384 --> 00:29:41,680
You're welcome.

514
00:29:41,767 --> 00:29:43,695
Any time. It's a pleasure.

515
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,415
Still up?

516
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:51,263
And on your iPad, I see,

517
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:52,671
which you're not supposed
to have at night.

518
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:53,839
Can I please have that?

519
00:29:54,952 --> 00:29:56,156
Thank you.

520
00:30:01,114 --> 00:30:03,574
Listen, um, me and you
are gonna have breakfast

521
00:30:03,662 --> 00:30:05,531
with Max and Josh
in the morning.

522
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:08,037
I have to work for a few hours,
but I'm gonna get off early,

523
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,974
and I'll meet you guys
at Whaler's Cove...

524
00:30:10,062 --> 00:30:12,132
I don't know,
sometime in the afternoon.

525
00:30:13,007 --> 00:30:15,072
And then you, me, Celeste,
and the boys

526
00:30:15,195 --> 00:30:16,492
are gonna go kayaking.

527
00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:17,782
Cool.

528
00:30:17,862 --> 00:30:20,282
It's not a reward
for bad behavior.

529
00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:22,703
I just figured...
since you're suspended,

530
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:24,992
I mean, we might as well
get some exercise.

531
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,078
You like Corey. Right?

532
00:30:32,362 --> 00:30:34,585
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I do.

533
00:30:35,062 --> 00:30:37,671
- Me too.
- That's good.

534
00:30:39,112 --> 00:30:41,781
Am I gonna grow up
to be like him?

535
00:30:42,072 --> 00:30:43,362
Like Corey?

536
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,179
No. Like my... my father.

537
00:30:47,132 --> 00:30:48,929
No. God, no, baby.

538
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:53,906
And you are gonna grow up
to be the sweetest...

539
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,007
kindest... most handsome...

540
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:01,822
funniest, loveliest...

541
00:31:02,015 --> 00:31:05,322
adorable-est man.

542
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,429
- I promise you that.
- Thanks, Mom.

543
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,507
I love you.

544
00:31:35,612 --> 00:31:36,898
Baby?

545
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:40,976
He's at the hospital...

546
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,406
sitting vigil.
He wanted us to take a break.

547
00:31:45,123 --> 00:31:46,296
Sweet.

548
00:31:49,438 --> 00:31:51,234
I was protecting you.

549
00:31:53,888 --> 00:31:55,320
Or so I thought.

550
00:31:55,898 --> 00:31:58,234
Best way I could.
By keeping the peace.

551
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:00,324
It's okay, Dad.

552
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:04,351
I know how weak
I must seem to you.

553
00:32:05,468 --> 00:32:07,880
But I was just trying to do
whatever I could

554
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,898
to make the rage go away.
For you.

555
00:32:13,662 --> 00:32:15,101
And for me.

556
00:32:15,782 --> 00:32:17,992
- Okay.
- And for her.

557
00:32:28,702 --> 00:32:30,968
She started to talk
this afternoon.

558
00:32:31,937 --> 00:32:33,367
To mumble.

559
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:38,822
I had no idea what
she was trying to say.

560
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,112
Um...

561
00:32:40,202 --> 00:32:42,452
She tried and she tried
and finally, I got it.

562
00:32:42,868 --> 00:32:44,158
What'd she say?

563
00:32:45,662 --> 00:32:47,203
She said you're drowning.

564
00:32:49,898 --> 00:32:54,068
Sometimes, the things she feels
and sees turn out to be right,

565
00:32:54,156 --> 00:32:56,116
- and now I'm worried.
- Dad...

566
00:32:58,284 --> 00:32:59,704
What's going on?

567
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:01,484
I'm just gonna go check
on Skye.

568
00:33:05,862 --> 00:33:07,625
Why is Grandma doing this?

569
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:16,453
Because I think she's...
She's worried that...

570
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,912
that I'm still sad
over missing your daddy,

571
00:33:19,992 --> 00:33:21,937
and... and she...

572
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:29,789
she thinks
that my sadness isn't...

573
00:33:30,452 --> 00:33:31,937
always...

574
00:33:32,862 --> 00:33:34,601
good for you two.

575
00:33:35,462 --> 00:33:38,672
So she thinks it would be
better if you lived with her...

576
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:43,289
for a while, while I get over
my sadness.

577
00:33:44,662 --> 00:33:46,179
Do you think that?

578
00:33:48,532 --> 00:33:52,656
No. Mm-mm. I do not think that.

579
00:33:54,072 --> 00:33:56,841
So, I don't know
what kind of questions

580
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:00,851
this doctor's gonna ask,
but if she asks you...

581
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:04,773
who you would prefer
to live with...

582
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:10,812
then it's really important that
you say you wanna live here.

583
00:34:12,402 --> 00:34:14,532
'Cause she might tell the judge?

584
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:18,015
Exactly.
She might tell the judge.

585
00:34:20,152 --> 00:34:23,609
Well, shall we say
we don't like Grandma?

586
00:34:27,322 --> 00:34:29,359
No, don't say that.

587
00:34:33,742 --> 00:34:35,515
We can protect you.

588
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,070
Yeah.

589
00:34:39,072 --> 00:34:41,843
We can say whatever
you want us to say.

590
00:34:44,772 --> 00:34:46,304
Listen to me.

591
00:34:47,242 --> 00:34:50,328
You do not need to protect me.

592
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:53,328
All right?

593
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,890
You just have to...

594
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:59,912
tell the truth.
That you want to live here.

595
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,367
- Okay.
- Okay.

596
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,578
I love you.

597
00:35:07,404 --> 00:35:10,796
Now get good sleep.
Big day tomorrow.

598
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:13,452
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night.

599
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,843
Good night.

600
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:20,679
Hey, Sweet Pea.

601
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:23,546
How come I'm not at school?

602
00:35:24,912 --> 00:35:26,617
Sweetie, I told you.

603
00:35:26,984 --> 00:35:29,052
Ziggy and Max and Josh

604
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,562
are having their special day
with their moms,

605
00:35:31,687 --> 00:35:33,242
and I thought,
"Well, wait a minute!

606
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:35,992
Let's us have
a mother-daughter day."

607
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,282
This is because we're broke,
isn't it?

608
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,130
- And we have to move.
- No, Amabella.

609
00:35:41,218 --> 00:35:43,508
It's 'cause I wanted
to spend the day with you.

610
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:47,085
Sweetie,
everything isn't about money.

611
00:35:48,532 --> 00:35:51,152
Well, it is, but it isn't.

612
00:35:51,242 --> 00:35:54,492
What matters is... this.

613
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,032
Your family, your friends...

614
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,465
Now, when you're ready...

615
00:35:59,612 --> 00:36:03,289
I will race you to that pool,
we will dive in,

616
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:06,242
and we will have so much fun!

617
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:07,937
- Okay?
- Okay.

618
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:09,804
Don't worry.

619
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:18,992
Do you and Ed have another plan?

620
00:36:19,198 --> 00:36:20,554
No, not yet.

621
00:36:20,742 --> 00:36:22,202
- You know what I was thinking?
- Hmm?

622
00:36:22,282 --> 00:36:23,825
He loves to golf, so maybe
I'll learn to golf.

623
00:36:23,912 --> 00:36:25,202
Something we can do together.

624
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:27,202
Mom, why would you want to golf?
You hate golf.

625
00:36:27,282 --> 00:36:30,492
True. But I took a vow.
For better or worse.

626
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:32,263
All right,
it's all over your face.

627
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:34,158
No, it's not! It's fine!

628
00:36:34,246 --> 00:36:35,576
Mary Louise.

629
00:36:35,664 --> 00:36:37,322
- Madeline. Hello.
- Hi.

630
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,732
- This is my daughter, Abigail.
- Oh.

631
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,913
- This is Mary Louise Wright.
- Hi.

632
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,242
You must be the one
who's off to college.

633
00:36:43,406 --> 00:36:45,242
- Um...
- Can I say something?

634
00:36:45,343 --> 00:36:49,072
- Of course.
- What you're doing is indecent.

635
00:36:49,304 --> 00:36:51,536
Trying to take those boys away
from their mother...

00:36:51,632 --> 00:36:52,967
Very nice to meet you, Abigail.

638
00:36:54,322 --> 00:36:56,843
Huh? Huh?

639
00:36:57,355 --> 00:36:58,815
She's psycho.

650
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,210
You're upside down.
How'd you get over there?

651
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:23,112
Well, you suffered a trauma.

652
00:38:23,202 --> 00:38:24,994
It's gonna take some time.

653
00:38:26,452 --> 00:38:29,282
I just think it's amazing
that you were...

654
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:32,033
still able to enjoy sex
all that time.

655
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,869
You know, despite everything.

656
00:38:38,032 --> 00:38:40,470
Yep, it's pretty fucked up.

657

00:38:49,431 --> 00:38:50,612
My turn again!

661
00:38:50,702 --> 00:38:52,506
Should I go save him?

662
00:38:54,025 --> 00:38:55,992
All right, boys, let's go!

663
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:57,242
You ready?

664
00:38:57,322 --> 00:38:59,343
Ah, they miss this so much.

665
00:39:00,282 --> 00:39:02,416
I want you to stop worrying
about me.

666
00:39:02,712 --> 00:39:04,580
And start thinking about you.

667
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:10,384
Skye made this for you.

668
00:39:12,402 --> 00:39:14,992
You are right, though, I'm going
through a rough moment.

669
00:39:15,126 --> 00:39:16,587
But you know me, I'll...

670
00:39:17,862 --> 00:39:18,992
figure it out.

671
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:24,375
What, Mama?

672
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,532
K... Kill me.

673
00:39:49,702 --> 00:39:51,822
Oh my God!
Oh my God, you're so good.

674
00:39:51,912 --> 00:39:52,952

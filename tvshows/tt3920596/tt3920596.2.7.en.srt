00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:23,464
-If you see her doing that...
-MARY LOUISE: Sleeping Beauty.

161
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:25,714
That's how Perry
would describe her to me.

162
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:27,255
Sleeping Beauty.

163
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:31,214
He was her prince.

164
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:33,881
-And she killed him.
-FARBER: Mary Louise...

165
00:08:36,923 --> 00:08:39,214
only answer the questions
that are asked.

166
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:45,839
Oh, um, yeah.
No... No problem.

167
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:47,422
FARBER: Okay. Let's go.

168
00:08:58,631 --> 00:09:01,255
PERRY:
And she kept repeating...

169
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:06,297
over and over again...

170
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:08,464
MARY LOUISE: (DISTANTLY)
Look what you made me do.

171
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,506
Look what you made me do!

172
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:17,464
BAILIFF: All rise.

173
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:25,172
CLERK: Case number CV-04111,

174
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:27,631
the matter
of Joshua and Maxwell Wright.

175
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,214
This court is now in session,

176
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:32,047
the Honorable Judge
Marylin Cipriani presiding.

177
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,172
Be seated.

178
00:09:35,464 --> 00:09:38,339
JUDGE MARYLIN CIPRIANI: Mrs.
Wright, please take the stand.

179
00:09:38,422 --> 00:09:39,756
Mrs. Wright?

180
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:54,047
BAILIFF:
Please raise your right hand.

181
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,923
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

182
00:09:56,005 --> 00:09:57,798
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

183
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:59,714
-I do.
-BAILIFF: Be seated.

184
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:03,673
JUDGE CIPRIANI: Okay. You're up.

185
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:07,673
(SIGHS)

186
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:11,923
Mary Louise.

187
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:14,172
-Celeste.
-CELESTE: Clears throat.

188
00:10:15,964 --> 00:10:19,047
Your attorney made me out
to be quite the bad mother.

189
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,214
He was just asking questions.

190
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:23,255
You answered them.

191
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,172
Is it your observation
that I am a bad mother?

192
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:31,422
As I... as you heard me
tell Judge Cipriani

193
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:32,964
when we were in chambers,

194
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:37,631
I consider you to be
a wonderfully committed parent.

195
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:41,714
-That's not the impression... -MARY
LOUISE: As to my observations, yes.

196
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:45,964
I have observed you
being violent... with the boys.

197
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:49,047
I witnessed you throwing Max
to the ground and...

198
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,297
shaking him.

199
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:54,631
I saw you drive off, wearing
nothing but your jammies,

200
00:10:54,714 --> 00:10:57,798
under the influence
of who knows what.

201
00:10:57,881 --> 00:10:59,464
You say Ambien.

202
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:01,422
And you crashed the car,
in fact.

203
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:04,422
So, you're not okay.

204
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:07,464
That's my observation,

205
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:12,047
which we can all accept
after all you have been through.

206
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:17,714
But I cannot accept
these children being placed

207
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:21,005
in such imminent peril.

208
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:23,381
Did you ever report
to Child Services

209
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:25,714
that you believed my children
to be in danger?

210
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:28,214
I probably should have.

211
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:29,756
So, the answer is "no."

212
00:11:30,464 --> 00:11:32,339
Yeah, it's... it's "no."

213
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:34,673
Did you ever report
to any other agency

214
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:39,381
that you believed my boys
to be in "imminent peril"?

215
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:42,798
No.

216
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:45,673
You suggested that
I got violent with my sons.

217
00:11:45,756 --> 00:11:49,172
Is it your testimony that I am
routinely violent with them?

218
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:52,297
-No. Not routinely. But...
-CELESTE: Is it your testimony

219
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:54,964
that I am often violent
with them?

220
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:58,005
N... No.

221
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:01,047
But who knows
what I haven't seen.

222
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,214
So, now you're basing
your opinions

223
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:04,714
on what you haven't seen?

224
00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:06,089
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

225
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,756
I'm not a trained lawyer,
so the semantics...

226
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,130
CELESTE: Please, would you...
would you direct your responses

227
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:12,839
to me? I'm asking the questions.

228
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:19,214
Now, the truth of it is,

229
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:22,506
you saw me
lose my temper with my son...

230
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,422
once.

231
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:27,381
Where I overreacted,
I pushed him to the ground...

232
00:12:27,464 --> 00:12:28,631
once.

233
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,339
-All it takes is once.
-CELESTE: Well...

234
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:32,339
you would know that better
than anyone, wouldn't you?

235
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:33,756
As a young mother,

236
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,214
did you ever lose your temper
with your boys?

237
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:39,589
Well, this isn't simply
about temper or temperament...

238
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:41,214
CELESTE: Did you ever
lose your temper

239
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:43,172
while you were driving
an automobile

240
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:45,172
and cause the car to crash?

241
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:51,005
Would you like me
to repeat the question?

242
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:55,506
No, I... I heard the question.
It was obscene.

243
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:01,839
Your son Raymond died, in part,
because you lost your temper.

244
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:03,923
-Isn't that true?
-FARBER: Objection.

245
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:05,589
CELESTE:
This witness has testified

246
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:07,047
that I put my sons in peril.

247
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,714
It is relevant
to this proceeding

248
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:11,422
as to whether or not she has
ever killed a child in her care.

249
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:12,547
(GASPS)

250
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:14,339
JUDGE CIPRIANI:
Mrs. Wright, please sit.

251
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:16,047
Please.

252
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:26,297
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?

253
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:29,631
I am simply trying
to protect my children.

254
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:32,172
Now, the idea of you driving

255
00:13:32,255 --> 00:13:34,839
with my children
in the backseat of your car

256
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:36,839
while you lose your temper...

257
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:38,297
that is terrifying to me.

258
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:40,589
FARBER: Your Honor,
this is indecent.

259
00:13:40,673 --> 00:13:42,547
Are you suggesting
this cross-examination

260
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:45,464
should be limited
to decency, Mr. Farber?

261
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:48,214
JUDGE CIPRIANI: Mrs. Wright,
you don't get to go at him.

262
00:13:48,297 --> 00:13:52,464
Indecent or not,
this case is about mothering,

263
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:55,381
which puts your parenting
strategies in issue.

264
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,756
Now, I cannot imagine the trauma

265
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,881
of losing your child
in an automobile crash.

266
00:14:01,964 --> 00:14:04,964
It must have been
unspeakably devastating

267
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:07,547
for both you and for Perry.

268
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:10,881
-It was.
-How old was Perry at the time?

269
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:14,422
(WHISPERING)
He was... five.

270
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:16,297
He... He was five.

271
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:18,381
-CELESTE: Five years old.
-Mm-hmm.

272
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:22,923
CELESTE: (SIGHS) To witness
his... his brother die...

273
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:25,089
his only brother.

274
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:28,381
Did you put him into,
um, therapy?

275
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:30,172
To deal with the trauma?

276
00:14:30,255 --> 00:14:33,255
In those days, we were
less inclined to...

277
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,381
-outsource our children's pain.
-CELESTE: So, you assumed

278
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:38,964
that role, did you?
Attending to Perry's trauma?

279
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:40,464
Yes, I did. Mm-hmm.

280
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,214
CELESTE: And you talked to him?
You consoled him?

281
00:14:43,297 --> 00:14:44,339
Yes.

282
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:46,464
CELESTE: Held him?

283
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:51,631
All of the... All of the above.
Yes. Mm-hmm.

284
00:14:53,381 --> 00:14:54,506
Blamed him?

285
00:14:56,172 --> 00:15:00,214
Did you ever blame him
for causing the car to crash?

286
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:02,589
(SCOFFS)
I most certainly did not!

287
00:15:02,673 --> 00:15:06,130
Did you ever accuse him
of distracting you?

288
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:07,964
Did you ever say to him,

289
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:09,839
"Look what you made me do"?

290
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:11,881
No.

291
00:15:11,964 --> 00:15:14,714
No? So, if Perry were to have
told me that you blamed him

292
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:16,714
-for his brother's death...
-FARBER: Objection, hearsay.

293
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:18,214
JUDGE CIPRIANI: Overruled.

294
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:20,047
If Perry were to have told me
that you punished him,

295
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,756
you even emotionally
battered him...

296
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,172
I never, ever "battered" him!

297
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:27,964
CELESTE: If he told me
that you said to him,

298
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:29,297
"This is your fault.

299
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:32,339
It is your fault
that your brother was killed."

300
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:34,297
-(VOICE BREAKING) Stop it.
-If you were to have said that,

301
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:36,422
-did you ever...
-No, you stop it...

302
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:38,673
-FARBER: Objection, Your Honor. Objection.
Objection. -Did you ever, ever hit him?

303
00:15:38,756 --> 00:15:40,422
-Did you ever kick Perry?
-MARY LOUISE: I... I never...

304
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,255
-JUDGE CIPRIANI: Mrs. Wright.
-That's a lie! That's a lie!

305
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:43,964
Mrs. Wright, we do seem to be

306
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:46,422
drifting beyond the scope
of the inquiry here.

307
00:15:46,506 --> 00:15:50,589
My husband physically
and emotionally abused me.

308
00:15:50,673 --> 00:15:53,381
Your Honor well knows
that abusers don't just happen.

309
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:56,005
They are more than likely to be
victims of abuse themselves.

310
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,589
Whether or not
this witness is an abuser

311
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:00,381
is certainly, certainly not

312
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:01,798
beyond the scope
of this inquiry.

313
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:03,130
You're a liar.

314
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,589
And the fact that violence

315
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:12,339
may have been a part
of your sexual relationship...

633
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,381
Your Honor, I have no doubt
that she will get herself well.

634
00:35:06,464 --> 00:35:09,923
But in the meantime,
right now,

635
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:12,673
we just need
to safeguard the boys.

636
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:19,047
She wants what's best
for her grandchildren,

637
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:23,381
as she did for her son, Perry.

638
00:35:23,464 --> 00:35:26,130
That man that you saw
on that tape,

639
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:29,589
that was because of
your parenting,

640
00:35:29,673 --> 00:35:31,673
your caregiving.

641
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:34,964
It's one thing to be asked
to turn your children over.

642
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:36,839
It's quite another...

643
00:35:36,923 --> 00:35:38,714
to be asked to give them to you.

644
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,756
These are my babies.

645
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:45,130
I am their mother.

646
00:35:45,214 --> 00:35:46,422
And I have protected them

647
00:35:46,506 --> 00:35:48,130
against the most formidable
of odds.

648
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:50,714
I kept them alive.
I kept myself alive.

649
00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:54,964
And on this I agree with you,
Mary Louise,

650
00:35:55,047 --> 00:35:58,214
You had no... no idea.

651
00:36:00,255 --> 00:36:01,547
And that is the problem.

652
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:07,214
My sons are...
they're good boys.

653
00:36:10,547 --> 00:36:12,547
And I will raise them
to be good men.

654
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:14,839
They will be good men.

655
00:36:20,923 --> 00:36:23,589
I have a list
of conditions and compliances,

656
00:36:23,673 --> 00:36:26,339
which will be entered
together with my judgment.

657
00:36:26,422 --> 00:36:29,506
They are self-evident
and they are to be followed.

658
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:34,172
As for the judgment itself,
as it's been noted by all,

659
00:36:34,255 --> 00:36:37,714
these boys have been through
an unimaginable ordeal.

660
00:36:37,798 --> 00:36:40,673
They face great challenges
ahead with their healing,

661
00:36:40,756 --> 00:36:42,214
their development.

662
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:44,422
It won't be easy.

663
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:47,506
I'm not going to make it
any harder

664

from their mother.

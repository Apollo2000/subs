1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,429
No!

2
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:15,818
You're one of the Monterey Five,
right?

3
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:16,990
The Monterey Five?

4
00:00:17,078 --> 00:00:18,561
You were there the night
the guy fell.

5
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:19,711
Where did you hear that?

6
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:21,215
It was just the way he said it.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,498
How exactly was that?

8
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:24,617
Like we all have
scarlet letters on our backs.

9
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:27,844
Are you all right?

10
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:29,901
I killed someone.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,250
Remember?

12
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:33,523
Do you see
yourself as a monster?

13
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,774
I guess I still feel...
responsible.

14
00:00:35,862 --> 00:00:37,400
- Celeste.
- Celeste. Celeste? -

15
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:39,406
I wanna know
what happened that night,

16
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:42,476
but I doubt I would get
the truth, would I?

I must have taken my eyes
off the road and... and...

40
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:26,785
And then I don't...

41
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:28,522
You don't remember?

42
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,020
I was... I was driving and...

43
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:33,771
Ma'am,
have you had anything to drink?

44
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,695
No, I haven't.

45
00:03:39,322 --> 00:03:42,578
I couldn't sleep last night,
so I took a pill at 2:00 a.m.

46
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:44,344
And you don't even remember
getting in the car?

47
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:46,057
No.

48
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:48,499
But you passed the breathalyzer?

49
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:50,865
I did.

50
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:54,749
Babe, you gotta be
careful with Ambien.

51
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,929
Hey!

52
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:02,523
Hey, Bonnie! What are you doing?

53
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:04,123
Walking.

54
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:06,317
In the middle of nowhere?

55
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:08,071
This isn't the middle
of nowhere.

56
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,951
Well, you're on the side of the highway.

57
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:11,288
I was hiking.

58
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:14,593
- Okay...
- What are you doing?

59
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:18,266
Do you need a ride?

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Why would I want a ride
if I'm on a hike... Madeline?

61
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:25,268
- Are you on drugs?
- Am I on drugs? What are you...

62
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,232
- Are you on drugs?
- I'm sorry...

63
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,476
- I'm just walking. Can I walk?
- That just came out... I'm sorry.

64
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:34,519
My God.
Do you see what I'm saying?

65
00:04:34,846 --> 00:04:37,023
I have to get Abigail out
of her house.

66
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,578
That woman's not well.

67
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:44,054
- Thank you. Here.
- No, it was eight women.

68
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:46,685
Uh-oh. What?

69
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:48,724
You are a fucking
incredible publicist.

70
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:50,977
- Thank you. Goodbye!
- What?

71
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:54,393
Guess who's going to be
on the cover next month

72
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:56,227
of the number one
women's magazine

73
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:58,465
- in the US of fucking A?
- I have no idea.

74
00:04:58,553 --> 00:05:00,035
Oh, I think you know.

75
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:02,880
I think you know because you're
fucking married to her.

76
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:05,187
Oh, baby. My cover girl!

77
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:06,875
- Gordon Klein.
- I've always known you were...

78
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:08,974
Gordon Klein, Special Agent
Michael Nelson with the FBI.

79
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:10,764
- Whoa. Stand back, dude.
- Please put your hands on the hood of the car.

80
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:11,968
- I'm sorry, what...
- What's going on?

81
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:13,584
Hands on the hood now, sir.

82
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:15,227
- What the fuck?
- Do it!

83
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,105
Stop interrupting, ma'am.

84
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:19,161
What are you... Hold on! Hold on!
There's confusion, sir.

85
00:05:19,248 --> 00:05:20,413
There's no confusion.
Please step away from the car.

86
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,528
That's my husband,
Gordon Klein.

87
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:23,053
Count 371,
that's securities fraud, - ..please.

88
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,192
- Title 15...
- Renata, call Walter,

89
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,217
- all right?
- What the fuck is going on here?

90
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,383
What are you doing?
You can't just assault somebody

91
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,007
in the middle of a fucking
public place.

92
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:31,520
- You have the right to have an attorney...
- Ow!

93
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:33,521
- During any questioning.
- Goddammit! - Wh-What's that mran?

94
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:35,194
Call Walter now!

95
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:37,015
- You can't.
- Please step back.

96
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:39,109
Ma'am, we need you to relax. You need to relax.
- They're taking

97
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:40,545
my fucking husband in handcuffs.

98
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,754
We understand.
We will get you the information.

99
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:49,930
You had me worried sick.

100
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,144
You know what, it's my fault.

101
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,186
I had a bit of an emergency
this morning,

102
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:55,985
and Celeste came to my rescue.

103
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,917
Where's your car?

104
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,821
It broke down.

105
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:02,558
Are the boys okay?

106
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:04,805
Uh, yes, they're getting ready
for school.

107
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:07,164
- You went out like that?
- Well, I had to.

108
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:08,477
It was an emergency.

109
00:06:08,565 --> 00:06:10,812
Wh... What kind of an emergency?

110
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:13,148
The kind short people have?

111
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:18,101
You don't like me,
do you, Madeline?

112
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:21,351
I'm sure you mean well.

113
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,055
You know, when I was
very young...

114
00:06:25,644 --> 00:06:27,727
my family just moved, and we...
I was going

115
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:30,144
to a brand-new school,
so I was especially scared,

116
00:06:30,227 --> 00:06:32,310
and my father gave me
the best advice.

117
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:35,805
He said, "Mary Louise,
you just seek out the bully...

118
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:38,901
and make friends with her.

119
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:41,906
Am I the bully in this scenario?

120
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:44,266
On your awesome days,

121
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:46,656
I suspect you are a Godsend.

122
00:06:47,268 --> 00:06:51,687
But on your bad days...
decidedly less so.

123
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:56,849
Fucking weirdo.

124
00:06:56,937 --> 00:06:58,021
What?

125
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,262
What?

126
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:04,040
So, did you think

127
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:05,406
about our practice date?

128
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:08,168
- Our practice date?
- It's like a trial run.

129
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:10,310
You know, we could...
We could shower,

130
00:07:10,398 --> 00:07:11,702
we'd put on clothes,
we go to a restaurant,

131
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:13,186
we eat, we talk, and if it's not
a total disaster,

132
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:14,945
then we could do it for real.

133
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:19,966
Yeah... um...

134
00:07:20,268 --> 00:07:23,078
I don't want to offend you,
but you are...

135
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,560
I do think
you're a very genuine person,

136
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:27,227
but you're a very...

137
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,144
You're very strange.

138
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:34,264
You know, one of the last
socially acceptable bigotries

139
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:36,117
is the one against weirdos.

140
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:39,008
For what it's worth,
I'm emotionally intuitive.

141
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:41,023
I get a feeling about people
sometimes.

142
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,852
Hmm, you have one about me?

143
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:44,144
To be honest, no.

144
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:45,523
But...

145
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,518
You're... You're really tolerant
and you're friendly,

146
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:51,727
and you're really pretty.
You look good in waders.

147
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,352
How could I least not make room

148
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:54,915
for the possibility.

149
00:08:06,977 --> 00:08:09,047
Are you and Dad
going to get divorced?

150
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,453
What?

151
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:15,141
Honey... No, of course not.

152
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:17,594
What makes you say this?

153
00:08:17,936 --> 00:08:21,766
Dad never makes you laugh.
And you seem mad at him.

154
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:24,716
Well, I am not mad at him. Okay?

155
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:29,841
Who are you mad at?

156
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,661
Nobody.

157
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:43,419

164
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:17,178
I still miss him.
I don't think it's ever gonna stop.

165
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:26,301
When you talked to me
about dating again,

166
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:31,148
it felt like an affront.
Like, preposterous, even.

167
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,094
I only want him.

168
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:39,000
I'd like to try something.

169
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:46,476
Think back to one of the times
he was abusing you.

170
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:49,294
The time in the closet

171
00:09:49,518 --> 00:09:51,805
after his office
Christmas party.

172
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:58,101
I want you to close your eyes
to replay that incident.

173
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:02,867
- Please, don't ask me...
- It's important. Can you try?

174
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,406
I want you
to close your eyes.

175
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:13,305
To replay the incident.

176
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:45,992
Now, I want you to put

177
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,783
a close friend in your place.

178
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:52,857
Let's make it Madeline.

179
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:54,318
Put Madeline there
instead of you.

180
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:57,070
- Excuse me, I can't...
- Let's make it Madeline.

181
00:11:17,663 --> 00:11:19,663
No!

182
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:24,219
No! No!

183
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:50,586
Did Madeline deserve that?

184
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:57,047
Should Madeline stay
in that relationship?

185
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:09,531
Jacket?

186
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:14,851
Thank you. Not today.

187
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:18,349
All right.

188
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,539
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- <i>Step over here please, ma'am.</i>

189
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:25,539
Arms like an airplane.

190
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:30,392
Oh my God.

191
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,796
Gordon...

192
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:37,467
What the fuck?

193
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:39,955
What the fuck!

194
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:46,297
I'll be out on bond, so...

195
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:52,013
- Talk to me!
- I, uh...

196
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:56,025
I made a big bet
to short some stock with, um...

197
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:58,031
Saul Hoffman's company.

198
00:12:58,396 --> 00:13:00,824
Phederol, I think I told you
about them,

199
00:13:00,912 --> 00:13:02,310
- it's the anti-coagulant.
- The anti-coagulant.

200
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:04,019
So? I thought that was a bust?

201
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:06,107
It was. Oh my...

202
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:08,795
Um, which I knew, but, uh...

203
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:11,084
no one else did.

204
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:12,977
- Uh...
- Fuck.

205
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:16,310
So, then the test results
completely tanked,

206
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:18,521
so I started shorting big time.

207
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,185
Do you have to do time for that?

208
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,279
Oh my God. Oh my God.

209
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:26,716
Okay.

210
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:30,518
Listen...
That's not the worst of it.

211
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,602
What?

212
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:35,982
I kind of bet the ranch.

213
00:13:37,244 --> 00:13:38,495
Our ranch.

214
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:40,980
There's gonna be civil lawsuits
to follow that.

215
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:42,560
- No.
- Um...

216
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:44,511
We stand to be broke
by the end of the year,

217
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:46,395
- and it might even be sooner.
- Hold on. Hold on.

218
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:47,589
Hold on. I don't...

219
00:13:47,677 --> 00:13:49,107
Listen, listen, listen.

220
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,166
Amabella's gonna be okay.
They can't touch her trust.

221
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,668
- It's irrevocable.
- But I didn't sign anything.

222
00:13:54,756 --> 00:13:56,067
- I didn't do anything.
- No, no, I know.

223
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:57,227
I know you didn't.

224
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,499
- My money is safe.
- I know you didn't, all right,

225
00:13:58,586 --> 00:14:01,326
but it's community property.
Amabella's trust is... is...

226
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,396
Fuck! Goddammit!

227
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:06,670
Gordon...

228
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:09,894
I'm not gonna
not be rich.

229
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,366
- I'm not gonna have you...
- Listen, I was thinking that...

230
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:13,186
This... This could be like
a positive thing.

231
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:16,537
You know, that... that...
Like, there are chapters of life

232
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:21,029
I will not not be rich.

why don't you try talking to me?

255
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:29,435
I fucking tried,
and you know it. I've tried.

256
00:15:29,984 --> 00:15:31,435
You know that.

257
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:33,472
You know what,
it fucked me up some

258
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:35,584
when my marriage to Madeline
ended.

259
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:38,628
Divorce creates trauma.

260
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:40,435
Think something is gonna go on
forever and it doesn't.

261
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:42,310
Then you're on the other side
of it, and you just...

262
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:44,740
You don't really trust
the ground underneath your feet.

263
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:47,347
I've never lost sight
of the fact

264
00:15:47,503 --> 00:15:50,776
that marriage is fragile.
That it can all go away.

265
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:53,174
And you...

266
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,925
I don't know where
you've gone,

267
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:56,425
but you're not here.

268
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:13,776
He's in prison, and he might
stay in fucking prison,

269
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,264
and he's lost all our money.

270
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,061
Maybe he gets out,
what, for days?

271
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,602
- What? What?
- Until they fucking... Yes!

272
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:22,323
He's lost fucking everything.
My money too! His money.

273
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:24,286
Okay, okay,
come here, come here.

274
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:25,637
No, no, no,
we can't go in there.

275
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:26,933
We're not going in there.

276
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:29,339
Babe, this is a disaster.

277
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,987
Oh my God!

278
00:16:31,186 --> 00:16:34,448
Oh my God! This fucker
put me back in the hole.

279
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:36,440
This fucker put me
back in the hole.

280
00:16:36,614 --> 00:16:40,048
This is my fucking childhood.

281
00:16:40,136 --> 00:16:42,435
This is everything I've worked
to get out of.

282
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:44,008
And then Quinlan was there,

283
00:16:44,096 --> 00:16:45,207
- and I am telling you...
- What?

284
00:16:45,294 --> 00:16:46,681
I think she's been watching,

285
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:48,237
and she, like,
tipped somebody off.

286
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:49,519
What do you mean?
I thought it was the FBI.

287
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:52,190
Well, but then who the fuck
is tipping them off?

288
00:16:52,364 --> 00:16:55,364
And why is the FBI taking
my fucking computer?

289
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:57,394
- They went to my office.
- They took your computer?

290
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:58,815
- They took my iPad.
- What?

291
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:01,620
I just... Okay.
I need to call an estate lawyer.

292
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:05,435
Okay, and I need to do a list
of assets. You're right.

293
00:17:05,518 --> 00:17:07,034
Do you need a Xanax or...

294
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:11,894
When we swallow our feelings,
especially the bad ones,

295
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:14,602
sometimes they can turn
into really ugly monsters,

296
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:16,102
which is not a good thing.

297
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:18,310
I want you to know
that it's perfectly okay

298
00:17:18,393 --> 00:17:19,956
to come and talk to me, okay?

299
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:21,479
You can talk to me
about anything,

300
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:24,472
whether it was over a put down,
something that happened here,

301
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,102
something that happened
on the news,

302
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:29,227
anything you need to talk about,
I'm here.

303
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:36,354
Anyone?

304
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,542
What about a dead father?

305
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:47,551
He said it quite simply,

306
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:50,138
without any sense
of trauma, so...

307
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:52,331
whether that's better
or worse...

308
00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:57,138
Are they still
getting counseling?

309
00:17:57,928 --> 00:17:59,245
Um, yeah.

310
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:01,729
I'm really sorry about this.

311
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:05,977
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

312
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:08,061
It's good to talk about
what we feel.

313
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:09,727
I just...

314
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:14,461
I just think it's best
if you talk to me,

315
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:16,298
you know, rather than at school.

316
00:18:16,477 --> 00:18:18,602
But you don't like
to talk about it.

317
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:19,860
That's not true.

318
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,899
You like to pretend
everything's okay.

319
00:18:26,722 --> 00:18:29,305
Well, I shouldn't do that.

320
00:18:29,435 --> 00:18:33,735
I... I... We're a family, and...

321
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:39,336
and a family is meant to be open
and honest with each other, so.

322
00:18:39,876 --> 00:18:42,079
I don't think
we're that kind of family.

323
00:18:42,243 --> 00:18:46,133
What? Yeah, we are.
Of course we are, Max.

324
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:48,860
Of course we are.

325
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,841
Grandma!

326
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,680
Put it on the counter, please.

327
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:06,275
Hi! What happen...

328
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:08,672
Something came up
at school.

329
00:19:09,087 --> 00:19:11,297
It's like you said
the other night...

330
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:15,227
They're still grieving.

331
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:18,520
It's all just so hard, you know?

332
00:19:18,852 --> 00:19:20,446
Hmm.

333
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:24,907
I do. I do know.

334
00:19:25,258 --> 00:19:27,936
Right after the accident,
after we lost Raymond,

335
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:31,813
I was sure I would not be able
to go on.

336
00:19:32,836 --> 00:19:35,920
I was never sure about anything
in my whole life,

337
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:40,453
that I wouldn't go on,
but I did. Because of Perry.

338
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,597
And so will you
because of the boys.

339
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,144
What happened this morning?

340
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,774
I don't know. I just...

341
00:19:57,852 --> 00:19:59,810
I took an Ambien
when I couldn't sleep,

342
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:03,019
and before I knew it,
I was driving a car.

343
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,227
- Has that ever happened before?
- No.

344
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:14,621
I've decided
to rent an apartment locally,

345
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:20,503
so that I can, um, be nearby
but not... you know...

346
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:23,761
I wanna be here
when you need me, Celeste,

347
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:25,558
and not when you don't.

348
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:29,011
I'm so grateful to you
for everything you've done,

349
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:31,277
but a little space
might be good.

350
00:20:36,827 --> 00:20:39,452
Madeline told me
that you and she had words.

351
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,229
I don't like her.

352
00:20:42,905 --> 00:20:44,237
Well, you have to try.

353
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:46,742
Well, I have tried,
but she's not a likeable person.

354
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:53,586
She's been a lifeline to me.
She really has.

355
00:20:53,674 --> 00:20:57,377
- She's a wonderful person.
- Hmm, well, you're mistaken.

356
00:20:57,602 --> 00:21:00,769
Did I ever tell that she once
saved Max from drowning?

357
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:02,769
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

358
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,182
Huh. Where were you?

359
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,929
What?

360
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,588
I feel like you always look
at me with such...

361
00:21:12,732 --> 00:21:16,237
- suspicion.
- No, I don't mean to.

362
00:21:16,747 --> 00:21:20,764
I do look at you as a... a...
an enigma.

363
00:21:20,852 --> 00:21:23,176
That's how Perry
first described you to me.

364
00:21:23,264 --> 00:21:24,596
Did you know that?

365
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:26,380
<i>Hey!</i>

366
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:28,343
- <i>Stop, you idiot!</i>
- Hey!

367
00:21:30,602 --> 00:21:31,909
Hey!

368
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:33,514
That's enough.

369
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:37,331
- Stop it. I said... That is enough!
- Stop it. Stop.

370
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:40,266
Stop it. That is enough.

371
00:21:40,354 --> 00:21:41,959
- Fuck off!
- What did you say?

372
00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:46,154
No! You will not be like him!

373
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,342
You...

374
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:53,576
Max, I'm sorry. Can I see?
Maxie, I'm sorry.

375
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,162
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:56,437 --> 00:21:57,826
Mom.

377
00:21:57,996 --> 00:21:59,747
Oh my God...

378
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:04,126
Josh, come here.
Are you all right?

379
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:07,384
Huh? Are you okay?

380
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:20,466
You smell that?
Clears your sinuses right out.

381
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:25,475
We have all this newfangled
stuff to improve ourselves.

382
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,147
Self-help apps all over
our phones.

383
00:22:30,427 --> 00:22:32,932
Sometimes, all we need to do
is just...

384
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:35,654
stand still and breathe.

385
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:40,435
Just breathe in
the air that's all around us.

386
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,418
Is that for me, Mama?

387
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,537
You want me to breathe better?

388
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,146
Tell me what's going on,
Bonnie.

389
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,456
Nothing,
Nathan's just... trippin'.

390
00:22:55,544 --> 00:22:58,085
Nathan is a complete dolt.

391
00:22:58,352 --> 00:23:01,144
When it comes to emotional,
social intelligence,

392
00:23:01,232 --> 00:23:04,654
oh, Bonnie.
He's as dumb as a rock.

393
00:23:05,515 --> 00:23:07,098
But I often wonder...

394
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,976
if that's why you married him.

395
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:13,006
You are out here surrounded by
people who don't even get you.

396
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:14,935
They don't look like you.

397
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,732
I haven't seen one other
black person

398
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,584
since I've been out here.

399
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:20,740
Is that why you're here?

400
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:22,669
I mean, 'cause we all know...

401
00:23:23,305 --> 00:23:25,305
how fond you are of your walls.

402
00:23:26,117 --> 00:23:27,982
You are out of control.

403
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:31,383
Something's in the air, Bonnie.

404
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:33,092
And I don't like it.

405
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,979
You know I d...
I decided to run.

406
00:23:42,998 --> 00:23:45,217
For office?

407
00:23:45,936 --> 00:23:48,707
I swear to fucking God, man.
No, I decided to take up running

408
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:51,217
because Bonnie likes running.
She's obsessed with it.

409
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:52,769
I'm trying to embrace
her interests.

410
00:23:52,852 --> 00:23:54,393
So I'm off the hook
for lunch, then?

411
00:23:54,742 --> 00:23:56,231
You remember
what you said to me last year

412
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:57,623
about "give me a reason"?

413
00:23:57,711 --> 00:23:58,733
Mm-hmm.

414
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:00,850
Should we just get this
out of our system, man?

415
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,931
Okay, so you've asked me
to have lunch with your wife,

416
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:06,787
and now, you...

417
00:24:07,592 --> 00:24:09,646
- challenge me to a fist fight.
- I mean...

418
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:12,665
do you have a preference
if I can't squeeze in both?

419
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,244
Really?

420
00:24:16,594 --> 00:24:19,126
- So, that's a no, huh?
- Okay.

421
00:24:19,364 --> 00:24:21,406
- Don't, buddy. Don't.
- Okay.

422
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,939
Warning.

423
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:31,030
Case six-two-seven-three.
United States vs. Gordon Klein.

424
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:34,393
James Taylor on behalf
of the United States, Your Honor.

425
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,936
Steve Gardner
on behalf of Mr. Klein,

426
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:41,518
Your Honor.
Plead not guilty.

427
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,637
Mr. Klein.

428
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:49,936
You're being charged
with security fraud,

429
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:51,852
mail fraud, and wire fraud,

430
00:24:51,936 --> 00:24:56,691
violating Section 17A
of the Securities Act of 1933

431
00:24:56,816 --> 00:25:00,832
and Rule 105 of Regulation M
of the Exchange Act.

432
00:25:02,144 --> 00:25:04,824
- Question of bail?
- No priors, judge.

433
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:08,518
I ask that the defendant
post bail in excess...

434
00:25:08,668 --> 00:25:10,102
of one million dollars

435
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:12,560
in light of
the severity of the charge.

436
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,977
One million sounds excessive.

437
00:25:15,061 --> 00:25:16,762
One million bond.

438
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:19,066
Five hundred thousand
dollars cash...

439
00:25:19,154 --> 00:25:21,446
Stop!

440
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:23,979
We'll conference on Tuesday

441
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:25,176
to set a schedule.

442
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:27,384
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

443
00:25:36,393 --> 00:25:38,719
You know, I swear
someone's gonna do a startup,

444
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:41,268
and they're gonna make, um,
like, the perfect French fry.

445
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:45,019
It's gonna be, like, nutritional
and healthy and no cal.

446
00:25:45,338 --> 00:25:46,602
It's gonna be a gold mine.

447
00:25:46,685 --> 00:25:49,019
Remember when you used
to call 'em "pomp freaks"?

448
00:25:49,455 --> 00:25:50,642
Mm-hmm.

449
00:25:51,356 --> 00:25:53,659
French fries.
When she was little, I told...

450
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:55,371
I told her they were called,
"pommes frites,"

451
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:58,268
and she started calling them
"pomp freaks."

452
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:01,186
I never even noticed
you eating a French fry.

453
00:26:01,362 --> 00:26:02,727
I eat French fries.

454
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,909
Yeah, you're right.
You just didn't notice, did you?

455
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:06,963
That's your thing, isn't it?

456
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:08,557
Wait, what?

457
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:10,029
Don't get all sensitive
with yourself.

458
00:26:10,116 --> 00:26:11,749
No, no, I'm not.
I'm not being sensitive.

459
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,961
- I'm just... What do you mean?
- Honey?

460
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:17,944
No, I notice things.

461
00:26:18,685 --> 00:26:19,823
I mean...

462
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,327
Like, I noticed shit,
and then I asked you to come.

463
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,635
- So...
- Well, I'm here...

464
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:29,061
because you're ill-equipped
to connect with your wife.

465
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:35,011
Mom, you're drinking again.

466
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:36,385
No.

467
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:40,166
I mean, it's just one glass.
Occasionally.

468
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:43,948
One glass is fine.
One hundred, not so much.

469
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,477
Those days are over.

470
00:26:46,487 --> 00:26:48,029
Your problem
is you're oblivious.

471
00:26:48,158 --> 00:26:50,408
- Will you stop?
- You call me...

472
00:26:50,602 --> 00:26:52,791
and you say that
something's wrong with Bonnie.

473
00:26:53,594 --> 00:26:55,565
"Bonnie's not herself."

474
00:26:55,998 --> 00:27:00,112
"Been going on six months
to a year or so."

475
00:27:02,218 --> 00:27:03,301
Can you narrow that down

476
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:04,940
a little bit further
for me, Nathan?

477
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:07,393
I mean, can you pinpoint
a specific date?

478
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,760
Instance. Anything?

479
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,604
Because I can.

480
00:27:14,644 --> 00:27:16,393
It was after that event.

481
00:27:16,988 --> 00:27:19,291
You all went
to that student gala.

482
00:27:19,998 --> 00:27:24,080
Where the man died,
and Bonnie was there.

483
00:27:25,968 --> 00:27:27,940
Your wife watched a man
fall down the steps

484
00:27:28,061 --> 00:27:29,586
and bust his Goddamn head open

485
00:27:29,674 --> 00:27:31,810
and splatter all over the place
and die!

486
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,151
I don't know, from then to now,

487
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:36,875
she's probably been dealing
with post-traumatic stress.

488
00:27:36,963 --> 00:27:38,158
I'm fine.

489
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,477
We're in a restaurant, honey.

490
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,810
What does that mean,
"We're in a restaurant"?

491
00:27:40,894 --> 00:27:42,144
What, we should just glaze
over it?

492
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,393
Act like everything is okay?

493
00:27:43,481 --> 00:27:46,323
Things are not okay.
Your daughter is not okay.

494
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:48,974
And this mope-a-dope shit,

495
00:27:49,062 --> 00:27:50,937
it clearly is not working
for your husband.

496
00:27:51,078 --> 00:27:53,536
And I doubt very much that
it's working for your child,

497
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:56,484
and from what I see,
it is not working for you.

498
00:27:56,622 --> 00:27:58,041
Mom!

499
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:03,299
I'm really happy you're here.

500
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,227
Can we just have a dinner

501
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,685
like a normal family?

502
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:12,963
We are having dinner
like a normal family.

503
00:28:13,064 --> 00:28:14,481
Getting in
each other's business,

504
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:16,721
that's what families do.
That's why he called.

505
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:33,435
So you don't have any siblings?

506
00:28:33,518 --> 00:28:35,936
- I had a brother.
- Oh.

507
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,248
He passed away when I was five.

508
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:41,683
Oh... sorry about that.

509
00:28:43,061 --> 00:28:44,393
What about you?

510
00:28:47,385 --> 00:28:49,190
I'm an only child.

511
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:53,667
- I mean, as far as I know.
- Oh yeah?

512
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:57,612
Yeah, I'm not very close
to my dad, so... Right?

513
00:28:58,515 --> 00:28:59,807
You never know.

514
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:05,088
So... your mom passed away,

515
00:29:05,604 --> 00:29:08,651
and you don't have any siblings
as far as you know,

516
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:11,561
and you don't talk much
to your dad.

517
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:13,135
Mm.

518
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:19,479
Now, I don't mean
to be presumptuous, but...

519
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:27,026
if this works out...
I would have you all to myself.

520
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:39,536
Boys are tucked in.

521
00:29:39,624 --> 00:29:41,262
Thank you, Mary Louise.

522
00:29:41,354 --> 00:29:42,433
They must have been exhausted.

523
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,159
Max is asleep already.

524
00:29:45,313 --> 00:29:47,291
They tell me
they have a brother.

525
00:29:48,748 --> 00:29:51,815
- Evidently, Perry had a son...
- What?

526
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:53,330
with another woman.

527
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,049
And the boy's in their class.

528
00:29:56,927 --> 00:29:59,416
Seems I have another grandchild.

529
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:03,731
Might you have the decency
to tell me...

530
00:30:04,274 --> 00:30:05,737
his name?

531
00:30:07,424 --> 00:30:08,758
No!

532
00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:10,554
Then how could
they possibly know?

533
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,527
I don't know. You know what,
we did tell that detective.

534
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:13,645
That fucking bitch,

535
00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:14,903
- she probably let it slip...
- Mom!

536
00:30:14,991 --> 00:30:17,112
I'm sorry.
You know what, Celeste,

537
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,071
<i>just find out what the boys
know exactly</i>

538
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:22,010
and then call me right back,
okay? Bye.

539
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,562
What now?

540
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,186
Celeste... just stuff
with the twins, and...

541
00:30:26,268 --> 00:30:28,213
Did they find out Ziggy's
their brother?

542
00:30:28,518 --> 00:30:30,010
Who told you that?

543
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:32,346
I heard you talking
on the phone once.

544
00:30:32,434 --> 00:30:34,056
Did you tell Max and Josh?

545
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:37,268
Only that they have a brother
in the second grade.

546
00:30:37,685 --> 00:30:40,019
- Chloe, good God!
- I didn't say who.

547
00:30:40,102 --> 00:30:42,102
- Did you tell Ziggy this?
- Mm-hmm.

548
00:30:42,186 --> 00:30:45,760
Wait, Perry Wright
is Ziggy's father?

549
00:30:46,924 --> 00:30:48,699
- You know what, go to your room.
- I'm sorry.

550
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:50,077
Give me your phone.

551
00:30:50,393 --> 00:30:52,088
I'll deal with you later.

552
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:56,057
I'm so sorry. She's grounded.

553
00:30:59,267 --> 00:31:01,424
- I got... I gotta go.
- Okay, I...

554
00:31:02,325 --> 00:31:03,622
Oh, fuck.

555
00:31:03,939 --> 00:31:06,900
Hey. Talk for a sec?

556
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:10,852
- What'd I do?
- You didn't do anything. Um...

557
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,987
Did Chloe Mackenzie say anything
to you about...

558
00:31:15,806 --> 00:31:17,556
about who your father is?

559
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:22,573
She said
it was Max and Josh's dad.

560
00:31:23,322 --> 00:31:24,790
Is it?

561
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,651
Mm-hmm.

562
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:38,705
How long have you known for?

563
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:40,705
Since August?

564
00:31:40,793 --> 00:31:42,424
Ziggy, you've known since August

565
00:31:42,512 --> 00:31:44,363
and you haven't said
anything to me?

566
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,479
Figured you'd just lie.

567
00:31:49,936 --> 00:31:51,510
I didn't know.

568
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,414
All of those years
of you asking me where he was

569
00:31:54,502 --> 00:31:56,057
or who he was, I...

570
00:31:56,727 --> 00:31:59,112
I didn't know who he was.

571
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:05,312
I didn't know
until Trivia Night.

572
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:07,560
- And...
- But why didn't you tell me?

573
00:32:07,644 --> 00:32:09,375
Because I didn't know how.

574
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:12,758
I just thought
that I would wait.

575
00:32:13,377 --> 00:32:17,711
- Till when?
- Till you got older, I guess.

576
00:32:20,786 --> 00:32:22,828
Did Chloe tell you
anything else?

577
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:28,464
She said something about
Mr. Wright giving you salt.

578
00:32:28,552 --> 00:32:32,305
That's how it happened.
He salted you.

579
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:44,719
No...

580
00:32:53,606 --> 00:32:55,508
Then what did she mean?

581
00:32:56,335 --> 00:32:58,442
Can I sit down next to you?

582
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:12,641
I think what Chloe overheard
was the word "assault."

583
00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:18,625
What does that mean?

584
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:34,141
Look, I wanted to tell you.

585
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:35,938
Yeah, but you didn't.

586
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:38,668
Well, I was trying to protect
Jane and Celeste's privacy.

587
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,490
- But I'm your husband. Okay?
- Okay, but can you understand

588
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:43,560
and maybe contemplate
for a minute

589
00:33:43,644 --> 00:33:46,623
the fundamental violation
of a woman's privacy

590
00:33:46,711 --> 00:33:47,781
when you're talking about rape?

591
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:49,149
How about
the fundamental violation

592
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:52,430
of our family, of our marriage.
I mean, I'm your husband.

593
00:33:52,518 --> 00:33:55,101
I am supposed to help you
with this stuff.

594
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:57,186
I mean, of course
she's gonna hear you

595
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,560
whispering on the fucking phone,
Madeline.

596
00:34:00,726 --> 00:34:02,859
I mean,
look what our daughter did.

597
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:05,586
What are we, people who keep
secrets from each other?

598
00:34:05,674 --> 00:34:08,570
Is that our thing now? Come on.

599
00:34:09,532 --> 00:34:11,157
Jesus.

600
00:34:15,894 --> 00:34:17,234
Mom.

601
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:20,289
I'm really sorry again.

602
00:34:22,606 --> 00:34:25,680
I know you are, honey.
I know.

603
00:34:26,056 --> 00:34:28,139
You can't tell your friends
private things

604
00:34:28,227 --> 00:34:30,562
that you've overheard us say
on the phone.

605
00:34:31,144 --> 00:34:34,936
Okay? No more eavesdropping,
young lady.

606
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:37,133
Is Daddy mad at me?

607
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,653
Daddy's mad, but that's
the thing about families.

608
00:34:42,863 --> 00:34:44,487
Is that you can be mad

609
00:34:44,602 --> 00:34:47,186
and you can fight,
but you get over it,

610
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:48,560
and you always come back
together.

611
00:34:48,644 --> 00:34:50,695
That's wh...
That's what families do.

612
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,773
- So we're gonna be okay.
- Okay.

613
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:57,102
Can I have my phone back?

614
00:35:00,275 --> 00:35:01,461
So this thing

615
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:03,465
was supposed
to have happened when?

616
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,156
Like nine years ago?

617
00:35:06,586 --> 00:35:10,937
When you two were trying so hard
to have a baby? Please.

618
00:35:13,302 --> 00:35:15,886
When did you find out
about this alleged affair?

619
00:35:16,102 --> 00:35:19,685
It wasn't an affair.
It was a rape. Rape.

620
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:24,062
- When did you find out?
- The night he died.

621
00:35:28,435 --> 00:35:30,406
Then how can you... This woman,

622
00:35:30,494 --> 00:35:33,494
she could have had
multiple partners, you know.

623
00:35:33,582 --> 00:35:36,832
She could have been drugged.
She... You don't know her.

624
00:35:36,977 --> 00:35:40,523
She could have been...
What if she got it wrong?

625
00:35:40,654 --> 00:35:42,024
Aren't you desperate...

626
00:35:42,112 --> 00:35:44,571
- She didn't.
- For her to be wrong?

627
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,922
Aren't you desperate to know
that he wasn't unfaithful?

628
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,510
To believe that he...

629
00:35:50,598 --> 00:35:53,601
he wasn't capable of doing
the things that she said.

630
00:35:54,677 --> 00:35:58,562
He wasn't.
I'll... I'll never believe that.

631
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:01,894
Your son wasn't an innocent man.
He beat me up.

632
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:04,061
- I don't believe you.
- Many times.

633
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:06,310
Why wouldn't you go
to the police?

634
00:36:06,393 --> 00:36:10,102
- I probably should have.
- But... you didn't.

635
00:36:10,186 --> 00:36:13,268
- No, because it wasn't simple.
- I don't believe you.

636
00:36:13,352 --> 00:36:15,625
I don't understand why you're
so willing to believe her.

637
00:36:15,713 --> 00:36:17,125
I don't know why you...

638
00:36:17,234 --> 00:36:22,026
You are willing to assassinate
his character, his memory,

639
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:26,383
- who he was. I...
- It's so hard.

640
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:29,047
I'm telling you what it was.

641
00:36:29,182 --> 00:36:32,305
I'm not saying I was blameless.

642
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:36,398
I'm just telling you we were
violent with each other,

643
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,069
and sometimes...

644
00:36:41,419 --> 00:36:43,594
sometimes, it would lead to sex.

645
00:36:44,523 --> 00:36:47,187
I don't... I...

646
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:48,859
- We loved each other.
- Hmm.

647
00:36:48,947 --> 00:36:51,238
- We... We were...
- But he beat you up.

648
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:54,937
We had a sickness.

649
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,393
And you didn't go to the police?

650
00:36:59,142 --> 00:37:00,601
I just...

651
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:03,266
I'll go to the police.

652
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:05,633
What?

653
00:37:05,775 --> 00:37:09,648
To get some answers.
You left some things out, didn't you?

654
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,875
The fact that he fathered
another child.

655
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:13,375
You left that out.

656
00:37:13,463 --> 00:37:16,421
That you planned to move,
that you rented an apartment.

657
00:37:16,511 --> 00:37:17,886
You left that out.

658
00:37:19,683 --> 00:37:21,391
That you were planning
to leave him

659
00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:23,056
the very night he died.

660
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,502
You left that out.

661
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:29,359
And that you...

662
00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:35,134
you... learned of his infidelity
just ten seconds before he...

663
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:41,675
went falling down a flight
of stairs to his death.

664
00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:45,564
Oh, you left that out, too.

665
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,775
How's Ziggy?

666
00:39:09,148 --> 00:39:13,384
He's uh...
I don't know.

667
00:39:13,826 --> 00:39:15,242
And you?

668
00:39:15,692 --> 00:39:18,762
Um, I gotta tell you something.
I...

669
00:39:21,187 --> 00:39:23,377
I told Ziggy
about the circumstances.

670
00:39:24,139 --> 00:39:26,666
- The violence of it?
- Mm-hmm.

671
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:28,468
- What?
- Just a little bit,

672
00:39:28,555 --> 00:39:29,932
but he knows that
he cannot share it

673
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:32,019
with Max and Josh.
That it's just for him.

674
00:39:33,075 --> 00:39:35,427
- But we had an agreement.
- I know. I know.

675
00:39:35,515 --> 00:39:36,896
- We were gonna wait.
- I know, but I can't

676
00:39:36,984 --> 00:39:38,220
lie to him anymore.

677
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:39,558
- I can't...
- No, I...

678
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:40,955
- His entire life...
- Jane.

679
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:42,806
Has just been built
on a foundation of lies.

680
00:39:42,894 --> 00:39:44,658
I can't just... I can't continue.

681
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:46,889
And I know that you have
to protect your boys,

682
00:39:46,977 --> 00:39:48,783
but I have to protect mine.

683
00:39:49,382 --> 00:39:51,603
I have to be honest with him.

684
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:58,009
Ugh, God, this is so fucked up.

685
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:03,180
Have you told your boys
about Ziggy?

686
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:06,798
N... Not yet, no. I just...

687
00:40:08,227 --> 00:40:11,080
I will, I mean...

688
00:40:17,169 --> 00:40:18,556
Bonnie.

689
00:40:18,644 --> 00:40:20,144
- Hey.
- Hey.

690
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:22,103
- Could you talk for a second?
- Sure.

691
00:40:22,513 --> 00:40:26,388
Um, this is in no way...

692
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,750
meant to blame you
or Nathan at all,

693
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:30,453
for that matter,
but with that said, I...

694
00:40:30,563 --> 00:40:33,396
I just feel strongly
that Abigail come stay with me.

695
00:40:33,594 --> 00:40:36,109
Yeah, she needs more
than I can give her.

696
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:42,969
What's going on? Are you okay?

697
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:45,990
No, I'm not okay.
I told you I wasn't okay.

698
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:48,297
I'm having a hard time
with the whole thing.

699
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:52,756
Sometimes, I wake up at night
in a sweat

700
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:55,445
with this... feeling.

701
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,429
It's gonna get us.
It's gonna get us all.

702
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,976
What...
Who are you talking about?

703
00:41:04,224 --> 00:41:05,836
The lie.

704
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:09,542
I gotta go.

705
00:41:12,228 --> 00:41:16,936
<i>♪ As I walk this land
Of broken dreams ♪</i>

706
00:41:17,193 --> 00:41:21,458
<i>♪ I have visions
Of many things ♪</i>

707
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,341
You used to like that song.

708
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,393
I used to like to sit
on your face, too.

709
00:41:29,477 --> 00:41:31,139
You think that'll happen again?

710
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:35,756
Give me one fucking reason.

711
00:41:37,477 --> 00:41:39,069
I wanted a Gulfstream.

712
00:41:39,157 --> 00:41:41,009
Ow! What the fuck?

713
00:41:41,097 --> 00:41:42,430
Fucking pitiful.

714
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:47,142
We're creatures of want. Jesus.

715
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:52,352
You know, we are.
Me, you... God, especially you.

716
00:41:52,435 --> 00:41:53,408
What?

717
00:41:53,496 --> 00:41:54,338
What the fuck

718
00:41:54,426 --> 00:41:55,962
- are you doing?
- What the fuck?

719
00:41:56,111 --> 00:41:57,737
What are you doing?

720
00:41:57,977 --> 00:42:00,102
Are you fucking kidding me?

721
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:02,859
Did I ever explain to you
that I wanted more?

722
00:42:02,947 --> 00:42:04,930
- Is that what I said to you?
- Maybe I wanted more!

723
00:42:05,017 --> 00:42:06,268
Just get the fuck out.

724
00:42:06,352 --> 00:42:07,440
- Oh, please.
- Please.

725
00:42:07,527 --> 00:42:09,616
Just stop being dramatic
and drive, will you?

726
00:42:09,704 --> 00:42:10,769
Oh my God, you're gonna
blame me? You're gonna blame me?

727
00:42:10,852 --> 00:42:12,322
Did I say
I was blaming you?

728
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,203
Are you fucking gonna blame me
while you lost my fucking money?

729
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,959
- I didn't say... I'm just say...
- Get the fuck out of my car!

730
00:42:16,046 --> 00:42:17,630
- Nothing happens in a vacuum.
- This is my fucking car.

731
00:42:17,717 --> 00:42:21,051
- Come on... Oh my fucking...
- Out of the fucking car!

732
00:42:21,222 --> 00:42:22,932
Oh my God!

733
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:24,477
Oh my...

734
00:42:24,591 --> 00:42:27,424
Will somebody give
a woman a moment?

735
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:34,901
Goddammit!

736
00:43:01,727 --> 00:43:03,310
I'm not resisting the idea

737
00:43:03,393 --> 00:43:04,644
of coming back here.

738
00:43:04,727 --> 00:43:06,810
Well, that's a relief.

739
00:43:06,894 --> 00:43:10,066
As long as the main goal
isn't trying to convince me

740
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:11,393
to go to college.

741
00:43:11,481 --> 00:43:15,199
The endgame is to move you
into a stable environment

742
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:16,538
where your executive

743
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:18,085
decision-making skills
are nurtured.

744
00:43:18,173 --> 00:43:19,507
That's a good one.

745
00:43:19,668 --> 00:43:21,769
Can I just say
one thing though?

746
00:43:21,857 --> 00:43:23,565
I think you're being rash,
honey.

747
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:26,073
Life is a series
of building blocks

748
00:43:26,161 --> 00:43:28,227
that you stand on
and you grow on, and I feel like

749
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:31,063
you are kicking the most
fundamental building block,

750
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:33,393
which is education,
right out from under you.

751
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,028
You used to claim that family

752
00:43:35,161 --> 00:43:37,019
was your most fundamental
building block.

753
00:43:37,102 --> 00:43:39,061
Well, of course.
It's very important.

754
00:43:39,294 --> 00:43:41,536
What, you just, like,
kicked that one to the side?

755
00:43:41,894 --> 00:43:43,497
What do you mean?

756
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,612
You were fucking the theater
director last year, so...

757
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,715
- That's so inappropriate, Abigail
- Well, you're being really

758
00:43:48,802 --> 00:43:50,061
- and this is not about me.
- Hypocritical, and I'm just using

759
00:43:50,148 --> 00:43:52,513
- This is about you and your future.
- The ref...

760
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:54,083
Ed...

761
00:43:55,847 --> 00:43:57,107
Hey.

762
00:43:58,184 --> 00:43:59,505
What's going on?

763
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,646
We were just talking
about college.

764
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,877
Is that it?

765
00:44:07,677 --> 00:44:10,455
What's this about fucking
a theater director?

766
00:44:11,435 --> 00:44:12,644
No, I...

767
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:15,144
- You misheard that.
- Huh.

768
00:44:25,186 --> 00:44:28,432
- Where are you going?
- Uh, to get my ears checked.

769
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,836
Goddammit!

770
00:44:33,924 --> 00:44:36,095
You said he wasn't home!

771
00:44:37,211 --> 00:44:40,336
- But we already know him.
- No, but now you'll...

772
00:44:40,435 --> 00:44:45,244
be meeting him as... I mean,
as brothers. That's...

773
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:48,525
We're already friends.
What difference does it make?

774
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,736
I don't know.

775
00:44:54,883 --> 00:44:58,822
This is what I do know:
He's part of your family now.

776
00:45:01,224 --> 00:45:04,150
And, I mean, family
is always everything, but...

777
00:45:05,323 --> 00:45:07,103
sometimes it is.

778
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:12,541
- Is Daddy a bad person?
- No. No, no, no.

779
00:45:14,008 --> 00:45:15,883
Your daddy was
a wonderful person.

780
00:45:15,971 --> 00:45:17,799
A beautiful person.

781
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:20,728
He could be weak...

782
00:45:24,784 --> 00:45:28,478
like we all can. He could make
mistakes, but your...

783
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:36,611
your daddy was a beautiful...
wonderful man.

784
00:45:53,244 --> 00:45:54,705
Okay, um...

785
00:45:56,682 --> 00:45:58,650
Thank you for coming back.

786
00:45:59,011 --> 00:46:00,783
I, um...

787
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,098
At best as I... fathom,

788
00:46:04,186 --> 00:46:07,596
and I cannot fathom
what I've done, I...

789
00:46:08,831 --> 00:46:11,346
This was about me, and I...

790
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,936
I'm so sorry. I...
This was not about you.

791
00:46:15,088 --> 00:46:17,283
- Maybe about us as a couple.
- Mm-hmm.

792
00:46:17,435 --> 00:46:19,352
And I think
we should get therapy.

793
00:46:19,435 --> 00:46:20,685
Okay...

794
00:46:20,799 --> 00:46:22,019
But I need you to know

795
00:46:22,102 --> 00:46:23,644
that this has nothing
to do with you.

796
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:26,562
This happened so long ago...

797
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,266
and it has nothing to do
with how much I love you

798
00:46:28,354 --> 00:46:30,104
because I love you
so much, and...

799
00:46:32,451 --> 00:46:34,910
and I just need to know
what you're thinking.

800
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:39,619
That you would...
keep the secret that you kept

801
00:46:40,628 --> 00:46:42,190
about Perry and Ziggy.

802
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:48,572
That you would be unfaithful.
Um...

803
00:46:50,977 --> 00:46:53,377
That you would tell Abigail
about it.

804
00:46:54,794 --> 00:46:58,003
I know. That is... That happened
in a moment of weakness.

805
00:46:58,102 --> 00:46:59,307
When?

806
00:47:00,385 --> 00:47:01,689
Last year.

807
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:04,479
So she's known a year?

808
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:06,418
My daughter,

809
00:47:06,636 --> 00:47:08,803
and yes, I do think
of her as a daughter,

810
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:10,849
has known this for a year?

811
00:47:10,937 --> 00:47:14,619
Yes, I'm sorry, I fucked up.
I, um...

812
00:47:16,013 --> 00:47:17,986
But I'm gonna do anything I can
to fix it.

813
00:47:18,074 --> 00:47:20,616
- Does Chloe know?
- No!

814
00:47:20,894 --> 00:47:22,642
No, of course not.

815
00:47:22,894 --> 00:47:26,019
- How can you be so sure?
- No, Ed, I promise you,

816
00:47:26,102 --> 00:47:29,127
she doesn't know.
I'm so sorry, she...

817
00:47:29,894 --> 00:47:34,791
Look, this just isn't about you.
It's about me. This is about us.

818
00:47:35,094 --> 00:47:37,302
When you say "us," what...

819
00:47:37,486 --> 00:47:39,939
I mean, what... what d...
What does that even mean?

820
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:44,736
'Cause it can't mean honesty.

821
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:49,267
Right? It can't mean
truth or... or trust.

822
00:47:49,936 --> 00:47:52,539
I mean, it can't mean you and me
confiding in each other,

823
00:47:52,627 --> 00:47:55,971
so what... what's "us"?

824
00:47:59,049 --> 00:48:01,967
You asked me what I'm thinking.
I'll tell you.

825
00:48:02,268 --> 00:48:05,150
I think we're done.

826
00:48:29,795 --> 00:48:33,955
I do appreciate you coming,
Mama. I do.

827
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:39,072
Meaning... enough.

828
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:49,353
I do not want
any of that in my family's life.

829
00:48:51,497 --> 00:48:53,682
We're not having
that conversation again.

830
00:48:58,544 --> 00:49:01,205
I have been having visions
lately, Bonnie...

831
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:04,807
- I know you've had some too.
- Mom.

832
00:49:07,107 --> 00:49:10,611
- They are strong, baby.
- Don't. Don't.

833
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,682
- Somebody's drowning.
- Stop.

834
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:20,080
I see lots of water,
and somebody's drowning.

835
00:49:23,122 --> 00:49:25,447
I see you drowning right now
in a way.

836
00:49:29,521 --> 00:49:31,557
Who's gonna protect you, baby?

837
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:36,127
I do not need you to protect me.

838
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:40,397
Not from evil spirits
or your visions...

839
00:49:40,485 --> 00:49:42,072
From what, then?

840
00:49:44,537 --> 00:49:45,971
Tell me.

841
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:54,174
What have you done this time?
Hmm?

842
00:50:01,034 --> 00:50:02,658
I do want you to go.

843
00:50:07,017 --> 00:50:08,563
I love you, too, honey.

844
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:15,227
Okay, you invited her,
you get rid of her.

845
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,560
Get rid of her?

846
00:50:16,644 --> 00:50:19,221
Like...
Like, maybe with rat poison?

847
00:50:19,803 --> 00:50:21,721
Or a weekend with Maddie?

848
00:50:26,385 --> 00:50:28,783
Seriously, though,
can you tell her to go?

849
00:50:33,812 --> 00:50:35,851
Can you tell me what's going on?

850
00:50:39,011 --> 00:50:40,893
Be patient, baby.

851
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:45,346
Patient.

00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,959
as to what you're doing and if
you plan to take my kid next.

785
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:31,833
What? What would make you think

786
00:40:31,917 --> 00:40:33,458
that I would seek custody of Ziggy?

787
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:35,250
You're a wonderful,
wonderful mother.

788
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,583
So is Celeste!

789
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,708
No. No, no.
I have concerns about Celeste.

790
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:42,750
Her mental and emotional health...

791
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,625
I know you're her friend, Jane.

792
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:49,000
But truly,
do you not also worry?

793
00:40:49,084 --> 00:40:51,959
- No. No, I don't.
- Well, put yourself in my shoes.

794
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:54,375
If you became convinced

795
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:57,084
- that the boys were at risk...
- They're not at risk.

796
00:40:57,167 --> 00:40:59,250
- Physically at risk.
- I've seen her as a mom!

797
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,416
She's a great parent.

798
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,875
You have seen
the outward appearance,

799
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,167
but I've seen the drawer,
with...

800
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,458
uh, Ambien and...
And Vicodin and, uh, Xanax,

801

something with a... "Trama..."
I don't know!

All these different medications,

803
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,416
and she's driving
on these roads.

804
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,792
Let me ask you, do you ever put
Ziggy in the car with her?

805
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:20,792
Does he sit in the front
next to her

806
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,167
when the twins are strapped
in the back?

807
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:26,291
Are you okay with that?

AMANDA REISMAN: I'm not
gonna testify against you...

810
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,959
But they might be able to force you.

811
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:36,375
They might be able to,
I don't know, get a court order.

812
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:39,583
Celeste, first of all,
you can trust me.

813
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:43,708
I trusted her, so don't talk
to me about trust right now.

814
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,792
I let her into my life.

815
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:47,833
I let her into my house.

816
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:49,458
I tried to help her.

817
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:52,541
Whatever you say to me
is doctor-patient privileged.

818
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,250
You know that.

819
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:57,625
CELESTE: I just don't feel
strong enough to handle this.

820
00:41:57,708 --> 00:41:59,541
They're gonna wanna
interview the kids,

821
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:01,625
and they've been through enough.

822

for God's sake.

- Maybe you can settle?

824
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:09,959
Don't tell me to fucking settle.

825
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:12,500
I'm not settling anything
with that woman.

826
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:15,500
God. These are my kids.

827
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:18,291
And she wants them.
She wants my boys.

828

DR. REISMAN: If she's seeking custody

829
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,416
on the grounds of
parental unfitness...

830
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,500
or neglect...

831

CELESTE: Whose side are you on,
for God's sake?

832
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:28,917
I've seen the way
these things play out.

833
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,291
- Nobody wins.
- I will win. I'll fucking win.

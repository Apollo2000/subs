00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:06,406
I think it's high time
we sing it with them,

163
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:08,865
so everybody let out
their inner otter,

Warren. (CHUCKLES)

176
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:42,331
Really pushing the school spirit
this year, aren't you?

177
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,217
Well, it's my otter blood,
Madeline.

178
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:46,945
- Hi, Madeline Martha Mackenzie.
- Lisa Coolidge.

179
00:09:47,032 --> 00:09:48,737
Anyway, it was
a beautiful service, Warren.

180
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:50,490
WARREN NIPPAL: (LAUGHS)
Well, thank you, Madeline,

181
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:52,667
I like to think of it more
as an assembly.

182
00:09:52,755 --> 00:09:54,737
A service
is for when someone dies,

183
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:56,737
you know,
like a school fundraiser.

184
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,945
You're not seriously
gonna go there, are you?

185
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:01,057
My hope is that
you don't go there, Madeline.

186
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:03,156
Now, let's remember
a lot of last year's mishigas

187
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:05,536
were lovingly stirred up by you.

188
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:07,865
MELISSA:
Anybody want a red velvet?

189
00:10:07,952 --> 00:10:09,945
- Melissa!
- Cupcake?

190
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:11,949
MADELINE: I'll take one
for each thigh.

191
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:13,629
- MELISSA: Absolutely.
- I don't even like to chew.

192
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:15,122
I just shove 'em down.

193
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:17,950
Maybe you can give one to Warren
so he can shove it too.

194
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:21,194
WARREN: (CHUCKLES)
And we're off.

195
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:23,217
- MADELINE: Bonnie.
- It's a classy crop of moms,

196
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:25,339
these ones. Those gluten-free?

197
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,862
MADELINE: Tahoe was good?

198
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:29,406
Uh, yeah, it was good.
Nathan caught a lot of fish.

199
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:31,319
Wow.

200
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:32,974
BONNIE CARLSON: And I hear you're selling
houses like crazy. That's very cool.

201
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:35,153
Oh my gosh, in Monterey,
it is like printing money.

202
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:36,863
I should have done this
years ago.

203
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:40,403
- I'm gonna go find Skye.
- Okay.

204
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:44,235
Okay. Are you two fighting?

205
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:46,782
Uh, no.
Actually, I almost wish we were.

206
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:51,212
No, she's... she's been acting
like that for a while now.

207
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:52,760
Acting like what?

208
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:55,880
Shut down. Like, withdrawn.

209
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:58,098
Oh, you mean
you're not having sex.

210
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,869
Okay, don't forget
that Abigail has

211
00:10:59,957 --> 00:11:01,877
- her college counselor meeting at 2:00 p.m.
- Yeah, yeah, I got your...

212
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:03,823
I got your emails.
Six of them this morning.

213
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:06,115
- Good. Thank you.
- This is her future, Nathan.

214
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:08,218
Nice to be back.

215
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:09,820
I'm told that my daughter,
Amabella,

216
00:11:09,908 --> 00:11:12,158
is going to be in your class.
So exciting.

217
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:13,580
Yes, very nice to meet you.

218
00:11:13,668 --> 00:11:18,035
Um, she has an IQ of 152.
Genius level, right.

219
00:11:18,123 --> 00:11:20,538
That's a very high number.
Life's about give and take.

220
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:22,478
I expect you to take care
of my daughter.

221
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:25,447
Pay special attention.
And, again, welcome.

222
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,527
Um, oh, oh, oh. (CHUCKLES)
And...

223
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:32,115
my Amabella was bullied
last year.

224
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:35,069
I mean, in like,
biting and choking.

225
00:11:35,156 --> 00:11:38,365
So, we're gonna make sure
that doesn't happen again.

226
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:40,990
- (BAND PLAYS)
- RENATA KLEIN: Oh.

227
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:43,001
Oops. Sorry.

228
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,503
Sorry.

229
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,573
Here's my problem
with the whole meditation thing.

230
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,028
It's like you shut out
the world,

231
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:49,407
but you also shut out
your friends,

232
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:50,650
which is a little bit weird.

233
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:53,736
And also, does she look funny?
Something's not right.

234
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:55,615
- Are you talking about Bonnie?
- Uh-huh.

235
00:11:57,036 --> 00:12:00,532
Like, she's off. But she was off
before she went to Tahoe.

236
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:01,865
Unplugged is one thing,

237
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:03,824
but unhinged
is a total other thing.

238
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:06,111
- (HORN BLARES)
- Hey! Asshole! Hey!

239
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:08,028
- Oh, hon.
- Why are you cutting me off?

240
00:12:08,115 --> 00:12:10,323
- Honey. The horn. The horn.
- Dick! I just think we...

241
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,403
Oh, yeah, sorry.

242
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,194
Once I lean in,
you know how I am.

243
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:15,365
- CELESTE: Indeed.
- I think we need to talk to her

244
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:16,865
and see where her head is at.

245
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:19,532
- CELESTE: Do you?
- Do you want to get a coffee?

246
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:21,653
By the way, did you see Renata

247
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,077
getting up
that new teacher's ass?

248
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:26,074
I thought she was gonna have
to pull out her snorkel.

249
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:28,240
CELESTE: Easy. I'm gonna go
to the ladies' room;

250
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:31,017
- can you get me an Americano?
- MADELINE: Will do.

251
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:32,854
- Hey, Bruna.
- BRUNA: Hey, Madeline.

252
00:12:32,941 --> 00:12:35,203
MADELINE: Wow, do you sell weed?
It smells like weed over here.

253
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,069
- Keep the change.
- BRUNA: Thank you so much.

254
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,824
- Can I get an Americano
- (DISTANT CHATTER)

255
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:40,063
and a bran muffin?

256
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:42,318
- That's a thing?
- MADELINE: Mary Louise?

257
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:46,026
- Hi. Madeline.
- MARY LOUISE: Hi.

258
00:12:46,114 --> 00:12:46,955
- Madeline!
- Yes.

259
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:49,290
- So nice to see you again.
- I'm Celeste's friend. Yes.

260
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:50,517
How have you been?

261
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:53,081
Good, good. The kids are good.
How are you?

262
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:54,624
I can't complain.

263
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:57,072
Actually, I can.

264
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:01,892
My son is dead.

265
00:13:04,657 --> 00:13:07,532
But Celeste tells me that
you continue to be so helpful

266
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,319
with her and the boys and...

267
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,365
She should just get
a proper housekeeper.

268
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:13,775
- You're very short.
- (SCOFFS) Excuse me?

269
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:15,651
I don't mean it
in a negative way.

270
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:16,947
MADELINE: Oh. (CHUCKLES)

271
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:19,464
Maybe I do.

272
00:13:19,822 --> 00:13:23,923
I find little people to be
untrustworthy.

273
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:27,734
(CHUCKLES) My apologies.
It's just that I'm...

274
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:31,698
I pride myself on being
a very good judge of character,

275
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:35,448
but you have always presented
such a difficult read.

276
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:39,198
You know,
you seem like a nice person.

277
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:43,611
Loving. But also,
you strike me as a wanter.

278
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,783
- A... A wanter?
- Mm.

279
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:47,330
You know...

280
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:50,777
there are people in... in life
who content themselves

281
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:52,705
with what they have,
and then there are others

282
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:56,658
who just... just want.

283
00:13:58,115 --> 00:13:59,244
I'm not a wanter.

284
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:01,027
Oh, you don't have to take it
personally.

285
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,213
Anyway, I'm a wanter myself.

286
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:07,903
You know what I want?
I want Perry back.

287
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,156
I wanna know what happened
that night.

288
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:13,115
And I... I'm very tempted
to ask you,

289
00:14:13,202 --> 00:14:15,783
but I doubt I would get
the, uh...

290
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:17,673
the truth, would I?

291
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,198
Your son lost his balance
and he fell.

292
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:25,319
Yes, that seems to be
the company line.

293
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,728
Depending on whose company
you keep.

294
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:29,350
Mary Louise.

295
00:14:29,587 --> 00:14:32,629
Madeline and I were just...
talking.

296
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,281
MADELINE:
What the hell was that?

297
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:36,990
That was a very strong position.

298
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,697
And I didn't like it!

299
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:40,900
Welcome to my life.

300
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:48,915
- (CARTS CRASH)
- Sorry.

301
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:51,689
Whoa. Hi!

302
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:53,718
Tori.

303
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:56,012
Sorry, I didn't recognize you
at first.

304
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,142
Yeah, I had my breasts done.

305
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,653
Oh.

306
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,837
Yeah, it's fabulous.

307
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:05,345
I always felt a little
self-conscious, you know.

308
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:08,278
About your breasts?

309
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,692
- My nose.
- Oh.

310
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:12,361
Now, nobody notices it so much.

311
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:16,782

she won't have a life.

What's going on?

Well, I thought I might look
for a small flat here in town,

540
00:25:38,505 --> 00:25:40,347
so that I could help out
with the boys

have a minute with Mrs. Wright?

Of course not.
You're in wonderful hands.

Mary Louise, I realize
that you're still grieving,

552
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:08,137
and that you've been through

553
00:26:08,224 --> 00:26:10,154
a tremendous amount
of heartbreak,

554
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,519
but I don't care for the way
you spoke to me before.

It was rude,
and I didn't deserve it.

No, you didn't. Um, I apologize.

Well, thank you.

MARY LOUISE: The truth is,
it had nothing to do with you.

559
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,136
When I was in boarding school,
I had... I had a best friend,

560
00:26:26,224 --> 00:26:27,725
or so I thought,

561
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:30,784
who revealed herself
to be quite treacherous,

562
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,091
and, uh, caused me
a lot of pain.

563
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:37,925
So... she was just
an itty-bitty little thing

564
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,228
with a big, bubbly personality
that, um...

565
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,766
was designed to hide...

566
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:45,878
that she was utterly vapid
inside.

567
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:47,854
You remind me so much of her

568
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:49,565
that I suppose I punish you
for that.

569
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:51,880
That's wrong of me,
and I apologize.

have stopped talking.

something to be recovered
from like a cold.

were not a patch on your dad.

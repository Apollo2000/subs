Hey.

15
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,617
Can I get a water, please?

16
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:57,218
Thank you.

17
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,856
Hi. Is Abby all right?

18
00:03:01,858 --> 00:03:04,924
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All in all, it's, yeah, great.

19
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:06,159
Thank you.

20
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:08,895
And it's a pretty smooth... six days?

21
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,330
- Yeah?
- So...

22
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:13,833
- Other than our little...
- What?

23
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:16,836
Well, our little, uh, dust-up.

24
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:18,672
Oh, you mean my dust-up.

25
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:20,673
No, I didn't say that.

26
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:22,575
Well, you didn't have to say that.

27
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,344
I was wrong to question your decision
to cancel the SAT tutor, I guess?

28
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:26,979
I didn't think you were wrong.

29
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,415
Because who cares if Abigail
doesn't get her scores up

30
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,751
or if she goes to a college that
requires more than a pulse.

31
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,487
Okay. Do you see what you're doing here?

32
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,021
I came here, actually,
to propose that you and me

33
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:38,823
and Bonnie and Ed have dinner together.

34
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:40,692
You wanted to propose that?

35
00:03:40,694 --> 00:03:42,494
Yeah, you know, to discuss

36
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:45,096
the transitional parenting
paradigm of Abigail.

37
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:46,765
Make sure there aren't
any glaring "ch-asms,"

38
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:49,267
like, uh... you know,
like this whole tutor thing.

39
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,737
"To discuss the transitional
parenting paradigms

40
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,472
to make sure we don't have
any glaring chasms?"

41
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:56,940
Who talks like that, Nathan?

42
00:03:56,942 --> 00:03:59,142
Why don't you just say
this is Bonnie's idea?

43
00:03:59,144 --> 00:04:02,946
Yeah, okay, yeah. It's Bonnie's idea.

44
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:05,916
Personally, I think the idea of us
all getting along is ridiculous.

45
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:07,984
But that's one of the things that
really defines being a husband,

46
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:10,688
is your willingness to go along
with your wife's fucked-up ideas.

47
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,928
- Give me a break.
- Like, by way of example,

48
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:13,423
when I was with you. You remember?

49
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:14,724
I paid $9,000

50
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:16,926
to ground the house against
electromagnetic fields

51
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:18,528
so that we all didn't get brain cancer.

52
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,962
Or the time when we went camping?

53
00:04:19,964 --> 00:04:21,964
I said, "Fucking mosquitos
bite the shit out of me."

54
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:24,534
Doesn't matter as long as our skin
doesn't come in touch with DEET.

55
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:26,369
What is your point, Nathan?

56
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:28,837
My point is I did a lot of
fucked-up things in our marriage,

57
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,405
a lot of hoops I jumped through for you,

58
00:04:30,407 --> 00:04:32,307
and now I'm doing those
same things for Bonnie.

59
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:34,209
Personally, I'd rather shove
an electric eel up my ass

60
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:35,677
and have it gnaw through my intestines

61
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:37,746
than sit down with you
and fucking Psycho Ed.

62
00:04:37,748 --> 00:04:39,648
But you know what, I'll do it,

63
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,685
'cause that's the kind of fucking
fucked-up fuckshit father I am.

64
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:45,286
How about that?

65
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:47,421
The man is losing his mind.

66
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:49,824
Can you believe it?

67
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:51,525
So, did you schedule the dinner?

68
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:53,160
Yes! I mean, a couples dinner?

69
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:55,763
He would've never done that
when we were together.

70
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:59,400
Never! But for Bonnie,
he's Mr. Fucking Sacrifice.

71
00:04:59,402 --> 00:05:01,201
Why don't you bottle up
some of that anger

72
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:03,470
- and put it to good use?
- What do you mean?

73
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:05,472
Mm, I think I could use you and Joseph

74
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:08,107
at the meeting with the mayor tomorrow.

75
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:10,577
Joseph can speak
to the content of the show

76
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:12,311
and we could use your passion.

77
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:15,448
I cannot possibly thank you
enough for this, Celeste.

78
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,250
I haven't done anything yet.

79
00:05:17,252 --> 00:05:20,085
- Thank you.
- I'm actually having fun.

80
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:22,254
Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

81
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:25,424
Anyway, you wanna meet at Blue Blues
in the morning after drop-off?

82
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,959
- I'll brief you.
- Okay. 'Night, honey.

83
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,695
Mm-hmm. Night-night.

84
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,833
Briefing?

85
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,302
The mayor is trying to shut down

86
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,105
this production of "Avenue Q"
at the community theater

87
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,809
because it's not appropriate, so...

88
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,778
I told Madeline I'd help her out.

89
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,981
Helping her out how?

90
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,117
Legal help?

91
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,651
Yeah.

92
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,068
Are you practicing law again?

93
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:01,001
Not practicing law,
just going to a meeting.

94
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:03,704
Oh, because this is the town of Monterey,
you can't afford to hire an attorney?

95
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:07,363
The town of Monterey is the one that's
trying to shut the production down.

96
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:09,299
Okay.

97
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:13,502
How come we didn't have
a conversation about this?

98
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:18,641
If you were here long enough
to have a conversation.

99
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:20,476
After the talk shifts from the kids,

100
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,746
you're off packing your bag
for another business trip.

101
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:29,651
You gonna hit me now?

102
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:33,354
Do you want me to hit you, Celeste?

103
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:38,760
Here we go again.

104
00:06:39,996 --> 00:06:41,896
Sometimes I wonder.

105
00:06:53,943 --> 00:06:56,343
Ed?

106
00:06:56,345 --> 00:06:57,845

The neighbors actually heard them
practicing for the talent show.

119
00:07:57,002 --> 00:07:59,035
They came to Trivia Night
with their game faces on.

120
00:07:59,037 --> 00:08:02,672
We're talking about
viciously competitive people.

121
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:04,874
You really are a nutjob, you know that?

122
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:06,709
Yeah, but I'm your nutjob.

123
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:09,545
That's true, as opposed to...

124
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:10,679
What?

125
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:12,414
That meeting with Nathan, honey?

126
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,182
He wants us all to have dinner.

127
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:16,184
You, me, Bonnie, Nathan,

128
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:18,754
all getting together,
exchanging niceties

129
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:21,557
and, what, group talking
our parenting skills?

130
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:25,060
Well, could be a good idea.

131
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:26,727
Are you kidding me? It's fucking Bonnie.

132
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:30,064
She probably just wants to show
off and serve us organic quinoa

133
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:33,734
with her kale she raised in her
sustainable vertical garden,

134
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:35,736
probably while she was meditating.

135
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:39,740
So help me God, if she so much as
teaches me how to peel a potato,

136
00:08:39,742 --> 00:08:41,909
I'm gonna go for her fucking throat.

137
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:44,711
That might not be a good idea.

138
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:46,379
Oh, what about "Suspicious Minds"?

139
00:08:46,381 --> 00:08:48,347
"Pocketful of Rainbows"!

140
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:50,717
Oh, no. Honey, you've gotta go to bed.

141
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:52,485
You never sleep.

142
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:54,387
You need to pick a song
no one else will sing.

143
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:57,190
- Well, it's not even listed, honey.

00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:22,103
Ziggy.

156
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:27,675
You were sleepwalking, baby.

157
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:35,482
What happened between you and my dad?

158
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,352
You can tell me.

159
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,095
You guys met one night
and then that was it?

160
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:50,096
He was gone?

161
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:55,034
Yeah.

162
00:10:55,036 --> 00:10:56,703
You don't have to look for him for me,

163
00:10:56,705 --> 00:10:58,838
if that's what you're doing.

164
00:10:59,873 --> 00:11:01,439
I'm okay, Mom.

165
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:05,010
We'll be fine.

166
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:06,812
Scoot over.

167
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:16,088
I love you.

168
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,922
I love you more.

169
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:19,389
I said it first.

170
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:20,657
I mean it more.

171
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:23,227
Ha.

172
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:26,731
I love you more than
all of those stars combined.

173
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:30,201
I love you more than
infinity times infinity.

174
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:02,697
I'm concerned.

175
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:04,800
About?

176
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:06,434
Your stress level.

177
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:09,203
I'm fine.

178
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,074
Well, you couldn't get pregnant.

179
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:15,643
When you were working, the doctors
all agreed that it had to do with...

180
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:17,078
I'm not trying to get pregnant.

181
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,680
No, I'm just saying, the anxiety.

182
00:12:19,682 --> 00:12:21,883
Yeah, I know my history.

183
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:26,419
I'm not trying to get pregnant.

184
00:12:26,421 --> 00:12:27,854
I'm just trying to help out a friend.

185
00:12:27,856 --> 00:12:29,622
What's the big problem, hmm?

186
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,159
Why is it such a big deal for you?

187
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:33,626
It's not.

188
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:39,632
I'm just looking out for you, Sparkles.

189
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,634
If you go to pieces again, who's
gonna put you back together?

190
00:12:43,838 --> 00:12:46,405
Madeline?

191
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,841
I'm the one who's always there for you.

192
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:50,209
Always will be.

193
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:53,913
It's just difficult
when you try to control me.

194
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:55,881
Yeah, well, the idea
of you resuming your career...

195
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:58,817
I'm not trying to resume my career.

196
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:07,225
I want to have another baby.

197
00:13:07,227 --> 00:13:08,759
- A daughter.
- What?

198
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:12,964
It's too late.

199
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:16,934
- You know I can't.
- It's not too late.

200
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,502
- Hey.
- What are you...

201
00:13:19,504 --> 00:13:21,638
Hey.

202
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,241
Can you imagine?

203
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:26,276
Having a little girl of our own?

204
00:13:30,382 --> 00:13:32,649
Being your husband,

205
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:35,517
Max and Josh's dad...

206
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,454
Sometimes I wish we had 10 kids.

207
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:41,390
Well, that was sounding romantic.

208
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:49,531
Let's have that little girl tonight.

209
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:52,000
Come on, I've got a busy day.

210
00:13:52,002 --> 00:13:54,469
Come on. What are you do...

211
00:13:54,471 --> 00:13:57,438
- Hmm?
- I gotta get up early.

212
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:00,375
Yeah?

213
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:03,711
Yeah, you're probably right.

214
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:07,381
Yeah, you're right.

215
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:10,251
Let's just call it a night, then.

216
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:11,685
Oh!

217
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:25,464
You think you're so
irresistible, don't you?

218
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:26,665
Huh?

219
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,806
I love you so much.

220
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:40,579
Yes, Ed likes to dress up in costumes.

221
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:42,047
- Presley?
- Yeah.

222
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,982
I think he has a fetish or something.

223
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:48,387
One night, I came home and he
had a full vampire costume on,

224
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:51,023
with fangs and everything,
and an accent.

225
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:53,325
And I think he thought it was sexy

226
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:55,593
and it would spice up our sex life.

227
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:59,863
- It didn't?
- Well, I mean, it was funny.

228
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,266
Uh, I don't know.

229
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,436
I don't know... I don't know why
I'm talking about sex so much.

230
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,504
Tom? When you get a chance, honey,

231
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,873
can I get something puffy
with chocolate on it?

232
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,875
- You got it.
- Thank you.

233
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,445
Why don't you mean to talk about sex?

234
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,015
Mm, no reason.

235
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:20,883
Because I was raped?

236
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:24,421
Well, I mean, I'm... I'm
trying to be sensitive, honey.

237
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,856
I... I don't always know
the right thing to say.

238
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:29,759
- But I certainly don't judge you.
- I know.

239
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,994
It's actually really weird.

240
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:34,463
Ever since I told you about Ziggy's dad,

241
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:37,766
it's like this thing that's
been happening to my body.

242
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:41,036
Like it's wanting to wake
up again or something.

243
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:42,537
- Oh.
- I always knew

244
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:45,474
that my reaction to that
night had been too big.

245
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:46,842
I pretended like it meant nothing,

246
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:49,077
so of course it came to mean everything.

247
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,246
But it's like I had
to say those stupid words

248
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:55,116
that he said to me out loud to you
for them to lose their power.

249
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:58,219
Like keeping them a secret
helped them retain their power.

250
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:01,655
So ever since then, I just keep
finding myself looking at men.

251
00:16:01,657 --> 00:16:03,091
- It's weird.
- Really?

252
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:04,525
But not in, like, a sexual way.

253
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:07,760
Like more just
in a appreciative way, maybe?

254
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:10,397
- Really?
- Sensual way. Mm-hmm.

255
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,133
Like that guy's arm over
there, with the tattoos.

256
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:17,471
Mm-hmm.

257
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:20,207
I don't know. Then my mind takes over

258
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:22,376
and takes me back to that stupid night.

259
00:16:22,378 --> 00:16:25,878
There's no way you could've known
he was such a fucking sociopath.

260
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,679
Fuck, yeah. Psychopath.

261
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:29,781
- Dickhead.
- Asshole.

262
00:16:29,783 --> 00:16:33,685
- Abominable pig.
- I'd kill him if I could.

263
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:36,755
Well, I mean, I wouldn't say that
out loud, like, in public spaces.

264
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:39,458
I'm just kidding.

265
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,393
Oh, my God.

266
00:16:41,395 --> 00:16:44,262
Have you really thought any
more about counseling, or...?

267
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,631
No.

268
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:48,433
I have been thinking
about something, though.

269
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:50,368
Don't get mad at me.

270
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,138
I just... I don't know.
It's really hard.

271
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,241
- I think maybe we need to move back.
- No!

272
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:58,175
Well, Ziggy's just not happy here.

273
00:16:58,177 --> 00:16:59,476
- I can tell.
- No, honey.

274
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,046
- Hey! How we doing?
- Hi.

275
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:04,148
Is this your go-to meeting outfit?

276
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,483
- Yes, this is it.
- Wow!

277
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:09,719
- Is there a cape under there?
- Would you stop it?

278
00:17:09,721 --> 00:17:11,515
You'll just have to wait and see,
won't you?

279
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:13,158
Mm, we are gonna win.

280
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,289
So...

281
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:16,561
Ugh, in breaking news, madam just told me

282
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:18,194
that she's thinking about moving.

283
00:17:18,196 --> 00:17:20,363
- I'm just thinking about it.
- What? No.

284
00:17:20,365 --> 00:17:22,665
No freaking way.

285
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,067
Come on, don't give in.

286
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:26,469
Ziggy didn't do it.
Do not let them get to you.

287
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:29,272
I'm not giving in.
I just... I don't know.

288
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:31,139
I need to do what's best for my kid.

289
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:32,674
I don't know what that is, but...

290
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,043
What about what's best for us?

291
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:36,611
- We would miss you.
- Madeline.

292
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:38,246
We would miss you.

293
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:39,514
You're gonna make me cry.

294
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,083
And we're gonna win this case,

295
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:42,350
I'm telling you.

296
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,053
I think the mayor is gonna
like your... argument.

297
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:47,255
- Would you stop it?
- Ha ha!

298
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:49,290
We've had who knows
how many orientations.

299
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:50,491
Nobody ever got choked.

300
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:52,059
Who are the new variables here?

301
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:53,660
Jane Chapman and her son Ziggy.

302
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:56,197
Whose eyes are abnormally far apart.

303
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,764
A sign of a sociopath.

304
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:59,600
Are we gonna make some changes today?

305
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:01,902
That's right.

306
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:03,770
We're gonna start with uppercuts.

307
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:05,638
And one.

308
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,640
Extend those arms.

309
00:18:07,642 --> 00:18:11,244
Two, one. First position.

310
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:15,982
One, and serve the platter.

311
00:18:15,984 --> 00:18:20,320
In, out. Out.

312
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:21,921
And lift.

313
00:18:21,923 --> 00:18:25,157
♪ I feel unhappy... ♪

314
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,691
And whip.

315
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:29,861
Whip, whip!

316
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:31,863
Other side.

317
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:35,867
♪ I have lost the best friend ♪

318
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:38,203
♪ That I've ever had... ♪

319
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:40,904
- Hi.
- Uppercuts.

320
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:46,377
God, I just love sweat on, uh, women.

321
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:49,647
Sorry, that was
more of a general observation.

322
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:53,050
I'm going to assume that you're not
here to talk about physical fitness.

323
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:54,385
Yeah, Madeline told me

324
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:56,886
about the dinner you and
Nathan are proposing,

325
00:18:56,888 --> 00:19:00,390
which I think is a
potentially a good idea.

326
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:02,225
But...?

327
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:04,194
Well, Nathan and Madeline...

328
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:09,533
that's a pretty volatile cocktail.

329
00:19:09,535 --> 00:19:12,402
- What about you, Ed?
- What? What?

330
00:19:12,404 --> 00:19:15,638
You've been a little
aggressive as of late.

331
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,775
Yeah, well, I'm only trying
to be supportive of Madeline.

332
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:21,777
She was kind of abandoned by her dad.

333
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:23,479
He only made time for her brothers.

334
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:26,148
And she felt abandoned by
Nathan, and now Abigail.

335
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,317
It's like a triple whammy.

336
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,553
She's in a pretty fragile state.

337
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:34,055
You know, we all have baggage, Ed.

338
00:19:34,057 --> 00:19:35,423
What do you mean?

339
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,859
Nothing.

340
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:44,031
It doesn't help, by the way,

341
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:47,201
that you're this
seemingly perfect step-mom.

342
00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:49,135
Anyway, we're gonna do this dinner,

343
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:53,340
but I think it'll be up to you
and me to keep things civil.

344
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:55,475
- I hear you.
- All right.

345
00:19:57,145 --> 00:20:00,681
Oh, also, it's probably best
if you don't give Madeline

346
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:05,117
any kind of advice,
like how to peel a potato.

347
00:20:07,722 --> 00:20:08,654

Amabella.

357
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:50,927
You weren't singing. Is there a reason?

358
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:53,830
No. I just didn't feel like it.

359
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:56,566
Oh, you typically love the sing-alongs.

360
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,305
Seems like something's
a little wrong, sweetie.

361
00:21:02,307 --> 00:21:04,907
Are you sure you're not
upset about something?

362
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:06,609
You can tell me.

363
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:08,844
I promise I will keep it a secret.

364
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:14,549
How are things with you and Ziggy?

365
00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:17,952
Fine. He's nice. We're friends.

366
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:19,788
That's great!

367
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,224
What do you and Ziggy
like to do together?

368
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:26,127
We just like playing and stuff.

369
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:27,862
And he's nice to you?

370
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:30,364
Yes.

371
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:34,067
Amabella...

372
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:37,104
is somebody still hurting you?

373
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:41,942
I found Ziggy's father.

374
00:21:41,944 --> 00:21:43,480
You found him?

375
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:46,123
Well, I think I found him,
but it's Saxon Baker.

376
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:48,315
He's an interior designer
in San Luis Obispo.

377
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:50,417
Hold on, didn't she say
his name was Saxon Banks?

378
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:51,991
- Well, I think maybe he only gave
- Maddie!

379
00:21:52,016 --> 00:21:53,333
his real first name.

380
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:54,754
She said he was an architect,

381
00:21:54,756 --> 00:21:56,889
but sometimes interior designers
say they're architects.

382
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:58,024
Oh, this is not good.

383
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,959
Thanks so much for helping us out,

384
00:21:59,961 --> 00:22:02,279
but I'm... I'm having
second thoughts about this.

385
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:04,563
- What?
- Look, even should we win this battle,

386
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:06,465
we make an enemy of the mayor's office.

387
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:08,099
- We have all of our funding!
- Long-term, it's not a good idea.

388
00:22:08,101 --> 00:22:09,735
And we're starting in two weeks, Joseph.

389
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:12,003
But what about the next production
and the one after that?

390
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:14,973
Listen to me, do you think "Avenue
Q" is worth fighting for?

391
00:22:14,975 --> 00:22:16,174
Yeah.

392
00:22:16,176 --> 00:22:17,643
Well, then what are we talking about?

393
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:19,244
The future of the theater itself.

394
00:22:19,246 --> 00:22:20,678
If we piss off the mayor...

395
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,380
and I've been told
he pisses off easily...

396
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,681
I can keep it civil.

397
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:28,519
Oh, no.

398
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:30,822
Or maybe not.

399
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,561
Look, I'm not looking to, like,
chill artistic expression.

400
00:22:37,563 --> 00:22:39,396
I hear it's a great play.

401
00:22:39,398 --> 00:22:42,031
That said, puppets fuck.

402
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:43,967
We can't have puppets
fucking in Monterey.

403
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:48,071
- May... may I be heard?
- There is one scene, and one scene only,

404
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:51,274
where two of the puppets simulate sex.

405
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:52,642
There's no nudity.

406
00:22:52,644 --> 00:22:56,144
Yeah, well, naked puppets
don't bother me.

407
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:59,448
Fucking puppets, on the other
hand, well, it's vulgar.

408
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,116
Even if it were,
you'd still have to prove

409
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:04,587
that it has no legal,
artistic, or literary value.

410
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:06,355
I'm not talking about legals.

411
00:23:06,357 --> 00:23:09,592
We're gonna have to talk about the...

412
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:13,895
To shut down a show simply because
it makes you uncomfortable

413
00:23:13,897 --> 00:23:16,598
two weeks before it's about to
open, I don't think that that's...

414
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,299
Okay, look, look.

415
00:23:18,301 --> 00:23:21,469
I'm new to the whole controversy, okay?

416
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:23,204
It's just been brought to my attention,

417
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:24,873
mostly by concerned parents,

418
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:29,042
so I'm bringing a fresh eye
to this thing, you know?

419
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:31,077
You can tell me I'm full of shit.

420
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,246
It wouldn't be the first.

421
00:23:33,248 --> 00:23:36,383
But from my perspective,
the whole point of the theater

422
00:23:36,385 --> 00:23:38,652
is to bring community together.

423
00:23:38,654 --> 00:23:40,186
- You know, to entertain.
- Mm-hmm.

424
00:23:40,188 --> 00:23:43,757
To have an affirming effect on society.

425
00:23:45,127 --> 00:23:46,859
This thing here?

426
00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:49,529
- It's already divisive.
- True.

427
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:52,231
And I'm certainly not
trying to connect the two,

428
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:54,166
but, uh, there are zoning laws

429
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:55,735
that prohibit sex shops
and strip clubs...

430
00:23:55,737 --> 00:23:57,102
Oh, please. Come on.

431
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:59,338
- This is hardly that.
- Yes, but...

432
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,040
This play deals with love,

433
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:03,274
and racism, and same-sex marriage,

434
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,076
which are all redeeming themes,

435
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:08,012
conversations this community
should be having.

436
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:10,048
I mean, and if you want
to continue to have...

437
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,984
Puppets fuck.

438
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:15,353
You are adorable.

439
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:18,757
May I speak for a moment?

440
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:21,091
Not as a member of the
Monterey Planning Board,

441
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,226
but, really, as a mom?

442
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:26,430
I think we can agree that the
world has gone to hell, right?

443
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,866
I mean, we're living in a
time where our little ones

444
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:33,103
have lockdown drills at school
because of gun violence.

445
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:35,806
They don't even feel safe
in their own classroom.

446
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,341
So what if we brought back

447
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,877
a little good old-fashioned nostalgia?

448
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,012
You know, a little "Sound of Music"?

449
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,214
I mean, we're Monterey, right?

450
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:47,517
So, what do we want to say?

451
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,120
And maybe the question
isn't "What is this play?"

452
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,848
but "Who are we?"

453
00:24:52,873 --> 00:24:53,848
Hmm.

454
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:56,001
I take your point. It's a good one.

455
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:59,561
- Right.
- We, uh... we all have small children

456
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:02,397
and this is the village that
we've chosen to raise them in.

457
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:06,535
And, um, I would say,
among other things,

458
00:25:06,537 --> 00:25:08,336
I hope we're open-minded.

459
00:25:08,338 --> 00:25:11,305
I mean, I think what draws
a lot of people to Monterey

460
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:13,541
is its progressiveness.

461
00:25:13,543 --> 00:25:16,076
But opinions aside,

462
00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:18,312
legally, you've already lost.

463
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:20,147
The California Constitution

464
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:22,817
goes way further than the federal
one to protect the First Amendment.

465
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:25,953
But to answer your question, Renata...
"Who are we?"

466
00:25:25,955 --> 00:25:27,388
I don't think we want
to become synonymous

467
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,689
with suppression and prior restraint.

468
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:31,057
We're going to face accusations

469
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:35,762
of being anti-American
and anti-free speech.

470
00:25:35,764 --> 00:25:40,333
I mean, that's not the politics that
you've been practicing, Mayor Bartley.

471
00:25:40,335 --> 00:25:42,869
So I would say there are
bigger black eyes

472
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:45,237
than putting on a controversial musical,

473
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:47,873
especially ones that have won Tonys.

474
00:25:49,844 --> 00:25:51,977
Stick that up your tight ass, bitch!

475
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:57,149
You were fucking brilliant!

476
00:25:57,151 --> 00:25:59,652
- Oh, really?
- Um, yeah.

477
00:25:59,654 --> 00:26:01,786
It's actually kind of annoying
that you look like that

478
00:26:01,788 --> 00:26:03,655
and you're smart and educated

479
00:26:03,657 --> 00:26:06,323
and intelligent and sympathetic.

480
00:26:06,325 --> 00:26:08,726
You even had Cruella agreeing
with you in the end.

481
00:26:08,728 --> 00:26:11,829
Did you see her face? I mean, come on!

482
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:15,399
Yeah, thanks.

483
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:17,835
What?

484
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:21,538
- What's wrong, honey?
- Nothing, nothing. I'm sorry. God...

485
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,075
Oh, stop it, Celeste!

486
00:26:25,077 --> 00:26:26,710
I don't know where this is coming from.

487
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:29,112
I really don't.

488
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:31,214
Well, maybe you do, honey.

489
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:40,255
It's just for six years
I've been wiping runny noses,

490
00:26:40,257 --> 00:26:42,992
organizing playdates, doing, uh...

491
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:47,296
everything to be a good mom, you know?

492
00:26:47,298 --> 00:26:50,700
And today I felt alive, I felt good.

493
00:26:50,702 --> 00:26:52,934
- Is that crazy?
- No.

494
00:26:52,936 --> 00:26:54,736
I feel so ashamed for saying this,

495
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,106
but being a mother,
it's not enough for me.

496
00:26:58,108 --> 00:27:00,575
It's just not. It's not even close.

497
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,477
It's evil, right? I'm evil.

498
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:04,178
- I've said it out loud.
- You are not evil.

499
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,914
- I am. This is...
- I'm not gonna let you say that.

500
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:09,850
- What, you think it? Do you, ever?
- Yes.

501
00:27:09,852 --> 00:27:14,321
I got so consumed
with Abigail and Chloe.

502
00:27:14,323 --> 00:27:17,324
- Their lives were everything...
- Mm-hmm.

503
00:27:17,326 --> 00:27:18,993
...that I almost forgot I had my own.

504
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:21,194
And... and I just had to do something,

505
00:27:21,196 --> 00:27:24,031
so I decided to volunteer
at the theater.

506
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:26,100
I'm not a performer. I'm not a director.

507
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,869
I didn't know what to do, but it just
made me feel like I was doing something.

508
00:27:29,871 --> 00:27:33,205
I wanted more, you know?

509
00:27:33,207 --> 00:27:35,975
I want more of that! That feeling.

510
00:27:35,977 --> 00:27:39,879
- 'Cause that made me feel alive, too!
- Mm-hmm.

511
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,282
I want more!

512
00:27:43,284 --> 00:27:45,784
Okay.

513
00:27:45,786 --> 00:27:47,085
- Jesus.
- Oh.

514
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:49,487
- And you know what?
- What?

515
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:52,057
- You're gonna be a lawyer again.
- No.

516
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:55,493
I mean, I have never seen you like that.

517
00:27:55,495 --> 00:27:58,697
For four years I've known you, and...

518
00:27:58,699 --> 00:28:01,866
your face looked different,
your body changed.

519
00:28:03,602 --> 00:28:05,502
- You miss it.
- Mm-hmm.

520
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:09,239
You're right.

521
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:10,975
I fucking miss it!

522
00:28:10,977 --> 00:28:12,543
Whoo!

523
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:13,678
Whoo!

524
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:18,447
Thank you for agreeing to meet me.

525
00:28:18,449 --> 00:28:19,916
I would've asked you
to come to the school,

526
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:21,317
but it's kind of a fish bowl there.

527
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,919
People can gossip.

528
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:23,887
What's going on?

529
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:28,658
I have reason to suspect,
and only suspect,

530
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,062
that Amabella Klein
is still being bullied,

531
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:36,799
and that Ziggy may be the culprit.

532
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:40,102
I haven't seen anything,
but I feel certain

533
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:41,904
that something
is going on with Amabella.

534
00:28:41,906 --> 00:28:43,438
She's made no implications.

535
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,475
In fact she claims that she
and Ziggy are friends.

536
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:50,345
And my personal experience of Ziggy...

537
00:28:50,347 --> 00:28:51,680
he is a sweet little boy.

538
00:28:51,682 --> 00:28:53,314
Yeah, so then where
is all this coming from?

539
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:57,251
Well, I sensed some tension
between them this morning.

540
00:28:57,253 --> 00:28:59,386
Amabella was visibly upset
about something.

541
00:28:59,388 --> 00:29:01,622
I observed Ziggy looking at her.

542
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:05,193
And from my vantage point,
he appeared to know

543
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:07,561
exactly what she was upset about.

544
00:29:07,563 --> 00:29:09,395
Maybe he saw her being bullied.

545
00:29:09,397 --> 00:29:11,031
Maybe he was concerned for her.

546
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:14,234
That could very well be,
though it wasn't my take.

547
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:17,670
Look, if I think that a child

548
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:21,875
is being physically
or emotionally abused,

549
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:24,778
it is my duty to go forward with that,

550
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,645
first and foremost, to the parents.

551
00:29:26,647 --> 00:29:28,447
What fucking evidence do you have?

552
00:29:28,449 --> 00:29:30,182
Jane, believe it or not,

553
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:31,683
I'm actually on your side here.

554
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:33,052
No, you know what?
If you were on my side,

555
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:34,419
you would not go to Amabella's parents.

556
00:29:34,421 --> 00:29:36,122
That is only going to make things worse.

557
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:37,957
You would find another solution.

558
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,424
This is ridiculous.

559
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:44,528
Okay.

560
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,898
Do you have any reason

561
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,734
to suspect that Ziggy could be violent?

562
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:52,771
- No.
- Maybe something from his past.

563
00:29:52,773 --> 00:29:54,305
No!

564
00:29:57,244 --> 00:30:02,579
Ziggy is a sweet, docile young boy.

565
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:05,715
He's never hurt a fly.

566
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:07,918
Wouldn't someone have fucking
seen this, for God's sakes?

567
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,787
They're in a classroom!

568
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:13,157
Okay, you know what?

569
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,993
Maybe you're gonna think
this is way off-book, but...

570
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:25,234
♪ Everyone's a little bit racist ♪

571
00:30:25,236 --> 00:30:28,404
♪ It's true ♪

572
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:31,640
♪ But everyone is just about as racist ♪

573
00:30:31,642 --> 00:30:35,310
♪ As you... ♪

574
00:30:35,312 --> 00:30:38,379
♪ If we all could just admit... ♪

575
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:40,882
Yeah, that's all I need.
No, that's perfect.

576
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:43,484
Thank you. Yeah, yeah.

577
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:48,323
- Isn't she amazing?
- Amazing!

578
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:50,325
I cannot believe
she's doing it for free.

579
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:52,326
She's my best friend.
She'll do whatever I ask.

580
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:54,795
- What if it goes to court?
- It's not gonna go to court.

581
00:30:54,797 --> 00:30:57,431
That is a done deal. It's amazing.

582
00:30:57,433 --> 00:30:59,800
You have nothing to worry about.

583
00:30:59,802 --> 00:31:01,702
You're so good to me.

584
00:31:01,704 --> 00:31:03,871
I believe in you.

585
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:10,210
- Oh, my God.
- I know, out of nowhere.

586
00:31:10,212 --> 00:31:11,777
- But...
- I'm still shaking.

587
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:14,413
One minute we're talking,
and then the next...

588
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:15,681
Oh, no. Uh-oh.

589
00:31:15,683 --> 00:31:18,784
...he puts his tongue in my throat.

590
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:20,854
This is assault. He assaulted you.

591
00:31:20,856 --> 00:31:22,521
Mm.

592
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:25,057
- I mean, I might've kissed him back.
- What?

593
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:26,424
It was like a reflex, you know?

594
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,560
Somebody kisses you, you kiss them back.

595
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:30,462
I might have grabbed his ass.
I don't know.

596
00:31:30,464 --> 00:31:32,865
- What?
- It just all happened so fast.

597
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:37,035
And the next thing I know,
he has his hand in my shirt.

598
00:31:37,037 --> 00:31:39,037
Or was it my hand in his shirt?

599
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,740
- Oh!
- What? It was a reflex!

600
00:31:41,742 --> 00:31:44,408
- Ugh!
- So you're saying the thing's mutual.

601
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:47,178
No, he jumped me
and then he yelled at me.

602
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,913
I'm in love with you. You hear me?

603
00:31:48,915 --> 00:31:50,814
I'm in love with you, Madeline.
I have been...

604
00:31:50,816 --> 00:31:52,783
For months?

605
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,419
So I slapped him.

606
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:57,321
What?

607
00:31:57,323 --> 00:31:59,756
This is not funny, Celeste.

608
00:31:59,758 --> 00:32:03,927
I'm a married woman and
he forced himself on me.

609
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:06,263
Okay, "forced himself"
maybe is the wrong word,

610
00:32:06,265 --> 00:32:08,365
but I hated every minute of it.

611
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:09,832
I didn't.

612
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:12,235
- Afternoon, ladies.
- Hi, Perry.

613
00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:14,237
Hi. What am I missing?

614
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,305
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

615
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:17,572
She's always laughing at me.

616
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:19,008
She's my best audience,

617
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,043
and apparently I'm a very funny girl.

618
00:32:21,045 --> 00:32:22,711
Uh-huh.

619
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:25,781
- How fun was it in court today?
- It wasn't court.

620
00:32:25,783 --> 00:32:28,117
She was incredible, Perry.
You should've seen her.

621
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,785
She was amazing.

622
00:32:29,787 --> 00:32:32,721
She doesn't know when to stop laughing.
She was amazing.

623
00:32:32,723 --> 00:32:34,622
Oh, I kind of already knew that.

624
00:32:34,624 --> 00:32:36,298
It wasn't court, it was a meeting.

625
00:32:36,323 --> 00:32:38,473
And it went very well
and it's done now, right?

626
00:32:38,497 --> 00:32:39,528
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

627
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:41,963
If my baby makes up
her mind to do something,

628
00:32:41,965 --> 00:32:43,431
you better get out of her way.

629
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:45,233
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey! My little men!

630
00:32:45,235 --> 00:32:47,402
- I made an Ollie today!
- Wow!

631
00:32:47,404 --> 00:32:49,003
I made a noseslide!

632
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:50,270
I don't even know what that is,

633
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:51,405
but it's really exciting.

634
00:32:51,407 --> 00:32:53,273
Mom, did you film all this?

635
00:32:53,275 --> 00:32:55,275
- No. No, I didn't.
- I want to show you, Dad. Come on!

636
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:56,910
Incredible! I want to see it,

637
00:32:56,912 --> 00:32:58,278
but let's do it after dinner.

638
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,879
Just gonna chill
with Mommy for a second.

639
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:01,815
- And funny Maddie.
- Go on, baby. Go.

640
00:33:01,817 --> 00:33:03,183
All right, all right, all right.

641
00:33:03,185 --> 00:33:04,551
There will be wine waiting for you.

642
00:33:04,553 --> 00:33:06,286
We're gonna go work
on our noseslides now.

643
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:09,288
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye. All right, outside.

644
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,723
- He's such a great dad.
- Mm-hmm.

645
00:33:13,428 --> 00:33:16,795
So... what really happened?

646
00:33:16,797 --> 00:33:20,399
♪ One pill makes you larger ♪

647
00:33:20,401 --> 00:33:24,836
♪ And one pill makes you small ♪

648
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:29,040
♪ And the ones that Mother gives you ♪

649
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:33,769
♪ Don't do anything at all ♪

650
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:35,974
♪ Go ask Alice ♪

651
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:41,996
♪ When she's 10 feet tall ♪

652
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:46,656
♪ And the white knight
is talking backwards ♪

653
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:51,261
♪ And the Red Queen's

00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:59,502

00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:08,077
♪ Feed your head... ♪

657
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,045
Oh.

658
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:12,415
Yeah.

659
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,850
Oh, buddy.

660
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,084
What's the matter?

661
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:19,721
Let me see. Let me see.

662
00:34:19,723 --> 00:34:21,490
There's no blood.

663
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:24,993
Take a deep breath. Come here.

664
00:34:24,995 --> 00:34:26,361
Should we go to the hospital?

665
00:34:26,363 --> 00:34:27,562
I think we should call the ambulance.

666
00:34:27,564 --> 00:34:28,863
I think we need to call 911.

667
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:30,332
- No.
- I think we should.

668
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,933
Should I call the tooth fairy?

669
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:33,967
- No.
- Or Santa Claus?

670
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:36,203
I'm sorry, buddy.

671
00:34:37,706 --> 00:34:40,641
The last time we had pizza
and we went to the zoo,

672
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:42,910
you told me we were moving to Monterey.

673
00:34:42,912 --> 00:34:44,845
What now?

674
00:34:47,816 --> 00:34:50,550
You're gonna go see
a child psychologist.

675
00:34:53,488 --> 00:34:56,789
I think he plans on signing
up for a class, that's all.

676
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,925
Did he hit on you at all?

677
00:34:58,927 --> 00:35:00,560
What did he say?

678
00:35:01,996 --> 00:35:04,030
Just that it should fall to me and him

679
00:35:04,032 --> 00:35:05,831
to keep the peace at this dinner.

680
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:07,399
I don't disagree.

681
00:35:10,304 --> 00:35:13,004
Did he, um... did he say
anything off at all

682
00:35:13,006 --> 00:35:14,706
or cross you in any way?

683
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:16,908
'Cause I'd love to have
a reason to pop him one.

684
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,677
Nathan Carlton.

685
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:21,813
I'm saying the guy's off, Bonnie.
Come on, admit it.

686
00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:23,081
The whole point of this dinner

687
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,015
is so we can all get along, okay?

688
00:35:25,017 --> 00:35:28,852
- Not so you can pop him one.
- The guy's off.

689
00:35:28,854 --> 00:35:31,889
At some point, boundaries
are gonna have to be set.

690
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:34,792
Hey. Hey, where you going?

691
00:35:34,794 --> 00:35:36,627
- I'm going to Becky's.
- Becky?

692
00:35:36,629 --> 00:35:38,629
Wait, is she the stupid one?

693
00:35:38,631 --> 00:35:40,730
Your mom's always nagging me about
letting you hang out with stupid people.

694
00:35:40,732 --> 00:35:44,000
- Dad!
- Well, she's still upset about the tutor.

695
00:35:44,002 --> 00:35:46,903
- Hey, what... what do you have there?
- Nothing.

696
00:35:46,905 --> 00:35:49,372
What are you carrying, darling?

697
00:35:49,374 --> 00:35:52,109
- I'm...
- Nothing!

698
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:53,710
I can check my bar.

699
00:36:00,718 --> 00:36:02,284
What?

700
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:05,721
What?

701
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:09,291
You need to relax.

702
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:12,161
We don't want anyone
getting hurt, do we?

703
00:36:12,163 --> 00:36:15,796
You know, we can always move.

704
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,465
We don't have to live in Monterey.

705
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,834
- Really?
- Yeah.

706
00:36:19,836 --> 00:36:22,670
You wanna move?

707
00:36:22,672 --> 00:36:26,107
Okay, first of all,
Skye loves it here a lot.

708
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:29,110
Second of all, we're never gonna
find public schools this good.

709
00:36:29,112 --> 00:36:31,012
And third, what about Abigail?

710
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:33,247
She goes back with her mom?

711
00:36:33,249 --> 00:36:34,914
She'll just move away with us.

712
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:38,718
That'll be the last straw for ex-thing.

713
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:45,425
Okay. All right.

714
00:36:45,427 --> 00:36:48,827
- A man's allowed to fantasize...
- Stop!

715
00:36:54,902 --> 00:36:56,435
What you doing?

716
00:36:56,437 --> 00:36:59,438
Nothing, just staring at the sunset,

717
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,310
thinking how lucky we are to
have that in our face every day.

718
00:37:04,312 --> 00:37:06,778
That is not what you were thinking.

719
00:37:16,523 --> 00:37:18,923
Abby know you go on her Facebook page?

720
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:20,192
Probably.

721
00:37:20,194 --> 00:37:23,561
I leave comments sometimes,
though under an alias.

722
00:37:23,563 --> 00:37:25,896
What's your alias?

723
00:37:25,898 --> 00:37:27,798
God.

724
00:37:29,068 --> 00:37:31,569
So, you went to visit Bonnie

725
00:37:31,571 --> 00:37:33,337
at her studio?

726
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:34,371
Wow.

727
00:37:34,373 --> 00:37:37,140
No secrets in this town.

728
00:37:37,142 --> 00:37:41,377
I was thinking about doing a sit-up
and wanted to get her advice.

729
00:37:42,947 --> 00:37:44,214
Went to talk about the dinner,

730
00:37:44,216 --> 00:37:46,849
how to best avoid friction.

731
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:49,185
Or animosity.

732
00:37:49,187 --> 00:37:53,223
- Violence?
- Exactly how psychotic do you think I am?

733
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,692
Mm.

734
00:37:58,962 --> 00:38:00,395
Come on.

735
00:38:11,808 --> 00:38:14,041
You doing okay, Maddie?

736
00:38:16,078 --> 00:38:18,246
Tell me. Tell me.

737
00:38:18,248 --> 00:38:20,548
I'll make you feel good, baby.

738
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:24,252
I just feel like I'm...

739
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:28,055
losing control a little bit.

740
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:30,390
Of?

741
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:31,958
What I am.

742
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,095
How so?

743
00:38:40,101 --> 00:38:41,934
I don't know.

744
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:43,403
You don't know?

745
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,819

I love you.

753
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:40,923
There's nothing like
the sound of crunching cereal

754
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:42,090
in the morning.

755
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:56,270
Wow!

756
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:59,607
Not too summery?

757
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:02,410
No, it looks incredible.

758
00:40:02,412 --> 00:40:05,547
It's funny how clothes always
seem to do that on you.

759
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:07,949
You're sweet.

760
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:09,651
What's the occasion?

761
00:40:09,653 --> 00:40:13,320
I have a meeting with the
attorney representing the town.

762
00:40:16,992 --> 00:40:19,593
- Another meeting, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

763
00:40:19,595 --> 00:40:22,863
I think we're gonna settle it today.

764
00:40:22,865 --> 00:40:24,765
Yeah?

765
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:26,667
What if it doesn't settle?

766
00:40:26,669 --> 00:40:28,502
Oh, well, we'd probably go to court,

767
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:30,936
but it would just be a one-off.

768
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:33,706
They really don't have any grounds.

769
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:36,175
So, a court appearance now, huh?

770
00:40:36,177 --> 00:40:40,613
Probably not, but what's the big deal?

771
00:40:40,615 --> 00:40:43,249
Well, the big deal
is that you lied to me.

772
00:40:43,251 --> 00:40:45,317
You said it'd be one meeting
yesterday, and then it'd be over with.

773
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:46,785
- I never said that.
- Now you're going to court?

774
00:40:46,787 --> 00:40:48,119
I said I thought
it would go away quickly,

775
00:40:48,121 --> 00:40:49,320
and I still believe that it will.

776
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,522
I don't want you doing this.

777
00:40:50,524 --> 00:40:52,123
Well, it's not your fucking call.

778
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:56,194
Mom?

779
00:40:56,196 --> 00:40:58,062
Okay, let's go, sweetie.

780
00:40:58,064 --> 00:41:00,465
Hey, champ.

781
00:41:00,467 --> 00:41:02,834
- Hi, Dad.
- Have a great day.

782
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:04,602
We're gonna be late.

783
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:06,504
Come on. Quick, quick.

784
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,005
Let's go.

785
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,242
Bye.

786
00:41:42,873 --> 00:41:45,040
Ms. Chapman?

787
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:47,075
Come on in.

788
00:41:49,146 --> 00:41:51,513
We had a nice conversation.

789
00:41:51,515 --> 00:41:55,215
He's a... he's a very smart little guy.

790
00:41:55,217 --> 00:41:57,151
Yeah.

791
00:41:57,153 --> 00:41:59,487
Please...

792
00:41:59,489 --> 00:42:00,955
have a seat.

793
00:42:07,564 --> 00:42:09,396
I, uh... I can see that you're nervous,

794
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:11,631
so I'm just gonna cut
right to the punch line.

795
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:14,968
I... I do not think Ziggy is a bully.

796
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:19,138
I brought up the incident that you
had mentioned at orientation,

797
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,775
and he made it very clear it wasn't him.

798
00:42:21,777 --> 00:42:23,977
And I'd be surprised if he's lying.

799
00:42:23,979 --> 00:42:25,612
If so, he's...

800
00:42:25,614 --> 00:42:28,981
he's the most accomplished
liar I've ever seen.

801
00:42:28,983 --> 00:42:31,249
And frankly, he doesn't show

802
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:33,986
any of the classic signs
of a bullying personality.

803
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:35,521
He's not narcissistic.

804
00:42:35,523 --> 00:42:40,192
And he certainly demonstrates
empathy and sensitivity.

805
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,230
Sorry.

806
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:48,633
Are you sure?

807
00:42:48,635 --> 00:42:51,002
Pretty sure.

808
00:42:51,004 --> 00:42:54,271
I definitely would like to see
him for another appointment.

809
00:42:54,273 --> 00:42:56,808
I think he's suffering
from a lot of anxiety

810
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,276
and I... I believe that there is...

811
00:42:59,278 --> 00:43:02,046
there's a lot he didn't
share with me today.

812
00:43:02,048 --> 00:43:04,681
And I wouldn't be surprised
to learn that he himself

813
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:05,949
is being bullied at school.

814
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:07,250
Ziggy?

815
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,786
I could be wrong,
but I wouldn't be shocked.

816
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:11,321
My guess is that it's verbal

817
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:16,660
and that some smart kid
has found his weak spot.

818
00:43:16,662 --> 00:43:19,595
He also brought up his father,

819
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,231
who, believe it or not,

820
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,834
he thinks might be Darth Vader.

821
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:26,536
What?

822
00:43:26,538 --> 00:43:30,606
Children often get caught halfway
between fantasy and... and reality.

823
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,874
And he's only six.

824
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:34,043
And I asked him if the two of you

825
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:36,711
talk much about his father.

826
00:43:36,713 --> 00:43:38,112
He said it upset you

827
00:43:38,114 --> 00:43:40,882
and that you're not
saying much about him.

828
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,652
Yeah, it's very complicated, so...

829
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,554
He said that be aware

830
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:49,591
that if we're talking
to my mom about my dad,

831
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:52,561
that she's gonna get
a funny look on her face.

832
00:43:54,597 --> 00:43:57,531
So I take it that Ziggy's father

833
00:43:57,533 --> 00:44:00,267
isn't exactly a good guy.

834
00:44:00,269 --> 00:44:02,135
No, not exactly.

835
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,041
And I assume that Ziggy's never met him.

836
00:44:07,043 --> 00:44:09,109
Yeah, no, he never will.

837
00:44:11,279 --> 00:44:14,213
Well, as I said, I think you have

838
00:44:14,215 --> 00:44:18,150
a caring, sweet
little boy on your hands.

839
00:44:18,152 --> 00:44:21,153
But I would like to see him again.

840
00:44:21,155 --> 00:44:22,989
Okay.

841
00:44:22,991 --> 00:44:24,557
Wanna see him?

842
00:44:28,629 --> 00:44:30,762
- Ziggy?
- Hi.

843
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,900
Look, Mom, a giant Harry the Hippo.

844
00:44:37,705 --> 00:44:39,104
Maddie.

845
00:44:40,608 --> 00:44:42,273
- What are you doing here?
- To talk to you.

846
00:44:42,275 --> 00:44:44,109
Have you been following me?

847
00:44:44,111 --> 00:44:45,643
- No, I haven't been following you.
- Oh, my God.

848
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:47,078
I wanna talk to you about
what I did at the theater.

849
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,178
You can't do this out of nowhere!

850
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,281
It was unacceptable, inexcusable.

851
00:44:51,283 --> 00:44:54,885
That said, it didn't happen in a vacuum.

852
00:44:54,887 --> 00:44:56,286
What do you mean?

853
00:44:56,288 --> 00:44:57,989
You know what I mean, Madeline. Come on.

854
00:44:57,991 --> 00:44:59,890
What happened a year ago
was an accident.

855
00:44:59,892 --> 00:45:02,626
I told you that was a mistake
that's not gonna be repeated again.

856
00:45:02,628 --> 00:45:04,527
Well, it was repeated several times.

857
00:45:04,529 --> 00:45:07,230
Okay, stop. It's been erased.

858
00:45:07,232 --> 00:45:08,698
Erased?

859
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,601
Yes, it didn't happen.
I am a happily married woman.

860
00:45:11,603 --> 00:45:15,672
- Really?
- Yes!

861
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:17,240
You know what? You told me you agreed

862
00:45:17,242 --> 00:45:19,008
that you were not gonna
open this up again.

863
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:21,076
Well, I don't agree anymore.

864
00:45:21,078 --> 00:45:22,344
All right, you know what?

865
00:45:22,346 --> 00:45:24,079
You stay in your life,
I'll stay in mine.

866
00:45:24,081 --> 00:45:25,514
Hey!

867
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,189
My major concern is
as to how he might react.

868
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:36,423
To the idea that you
want to go back to work?

869
00:45:36,425 --> 00:45:38,526
What did he say, his words exactly?

870
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:42,229
That he was afraid of me, um...

871
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:44,732
going through him.

872
00:45:44,734 --> 00:45:47,568
Ah.

873
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,537
Yeah, so I'm...

874
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:52,006
I suppose I'm just worried

875
00:45:52,008 --> 00:45:54,708
that he's gonna take it as a rejection.

876
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,910
You were working when he first met you

877
00:45:56,912 --> 00:45:58,478
and when he fell in love
with you, right?

878
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,115
Yeah, but he, um...

879
00:46:02,117 --> 00:46:04,384
he just likes me to be
at home in the house,

880
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:07,020
and we have the twins, and...

881
00:46:09,658 --> 00:46:12,024
He's not that crazy about me
having too many friends.

882
00:46:12,026 --> 00:46:16,095
He's just possessive.
That's who he is, so...

883
00:46:16,097 --> 00:46:18,998
And I hoped that you'd have
some ideas on the best way

884
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,402
to communicate with him
about me going back to work.

885
00:46:24,538 --> 00:46:26,138
No?

886
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,273
Well, I could certainly suggest

887
00:46:29,275 --> 00:46:33,078
some communicative tools, but...

888
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,914
for me, the issue isn't how
best to talk to your husband,

889
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:37,582
but why you're afraid to.

890
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:44,554
I'm not, um... I'm not afraid.

891
00:46:44,556 --> 00:46:46,090
I'm just...

892
00:46:47,827 --> 00:46:49,492
I just want to have...

893
00:46:49,494 --> 00:46:51,862
I suppose I want to communicate
it in the best way.

894
00:46:51,864 --> 00:46:53,530
That's...

895
00:46:54,734 --> 00:46:56,133
Okay.

896
00:46:57,436 --> 00:46:58,969
I'm not afraid.

897
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:02,638
The week leading up to Trivia Night,

898
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,674
something changed with Celeste.

899
00:47:05,676 --> 00:47:06,909
Still beautiful.

900
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:09,678
- But in her face...
- Her eyes...

901
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,181
Not a look like she could
actually kill somebody,

902
00:47:12,183 --> 00:47:14,050
but, um...

903
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:39,140
Yeah, I think it's him.

904
00:47:39,142 --> 00:47:41,909
If I heard his voice...

905
00:47:41,911 --> 00:47:43,410
I can still remember his voice.

906
00:47:43,412 --> 00:47:47,614
I can also still remember
that disgusting smell.

907
00:47:47,616 --> 00:47:51,018
- Where did you say he lived?
- San Luis Obispo.

908
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:56,189
You're not thinking
about going down there?

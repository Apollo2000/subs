1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,060
Tell me what's going on, Bonnie.

2
00:00:09,664 --> 00:00:10,664
Nothing.

3
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:13,745
Something's in the air,
Bonnie, and I don't like it.

4
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:18,540
What's this about a theater director?

5
00:00:20,044 --> 00:00:21,390
You misheard that.

6
00:00:21,913 --> 00:00:23,832
Hold on, hold on! What are you...

7
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:29,490
I will not, not be rich!

8
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:35,821
Did Chloe Mackenzie say anything
to you about who your father is?

9
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,613
She said it was Max and Josh's dad.

10
00:00:40,663 --> 00:00:44,208
You learned of his
infidelity just 10 seconds

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,543
before he went falling down a
flight of stairs to his death.

12
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:51,717
Oh, you left that out, too.

13
00:01:06,555 --> 00:01:08,319

00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:38,859
Yeah.

29
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:54,340
I fucked up.

30
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:58,222
There's no other way to say it.

31
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:02,548
And I don't think that
I'm gonna wrap it in a bow

32
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,865
and make it better, but...

33
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:07,381
I'm desperate to fix it.

34
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:11,523
Have you considered why you strayed?

35
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:15,471
How's your husband
to trust it won't happen again?

36
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:17,529
- Because it won't.
- But how can he trust that?

37
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,585
Why should he?

38
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,701
Thank you.

39
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:25,043
We'll turn to your betrayal in a minute.

40
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:27,082
My betrayal?

41
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:29,140
Adultery is one form of infidelity.

42
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:31,219
Indifference is another.

43
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:34,012
You describe yourself
as a go-along, get-along,

44
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:35,903
don't-make-waves kinda guy.

45
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:37,982
That makes you either
wonderfully accommodating,

46
00:04:37,984 --> 00:04:40,404
or profoundly disengaged.

47
00:04:41,537 --> 00:04:44,623
Could it be Madeline was just
trying to get your attention?

48
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:48,240
She has always had my attention.

49
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:54,341
Devotion on my end
has not been a problem.

50
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,373
Why were you unfaithful?

51
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,000
- I don't know.
- If you were to guess?

52
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:06,389
Should I guess?

53
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:09,653
You don't believe in you.

54
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:11,512
How can you trust
that relational equation

55
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:13,660
when you have no faith
in the sum part of you?

56
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:15,137
Math's not my strong suit, so...

57
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:16,521
Because you didn't go to college?

58
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:18,098
I'm sorry?

59
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:19,590
You spoke earlier

60
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:21,592
of your daughter not
wanting to go to college.

61
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:24,230
Does that have something to
do with her perception...

62
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,564
I don't see where that is relevant.

63
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:28,098
Did you go to college?

64
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:31,912
Again, I don't see the connection

65
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:33,512
between what's going on...

66
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:35,239
Abigail will be nothing without college

67
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:37,107
perhaps because you are?

68
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:43,794
Have you been feeding her this?

69
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:46,169
Why did your first husband leave you?

70
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:48,943
Because he's an asshole.

71
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,935
Tell me about your parents.
What was their marriage like?

72
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,152
- Fine.
- Fine?

73
00:05:57,177 --> 00:05:59,185
- Married for 40 years.
- Forty years.

74
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:01,064
You talk to them much?

75
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:14,109
<i>You have to be able
to hold your breath, baby.</i>

76
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,567
<i>But I don't like it.</i>

77
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:21,928
<i>You know what? I hate
getting my head wet too,</i>

78
00:06:21,953 --> 00:06:24,402
but we have to be able to
hold our breath underwater

79
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:26,872
so if something ever happens,
we don't drown, baby.

80
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:32,560
I don't want to.

81
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:40,558
Maybe when I was three, four,

82
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:43,598
I walked into my parent's
bedroom, and my dad was...

83
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:47,287
having sex with a woman
that wasn't my mom.

84
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:49,389
And they were making
all kinds of noises,

85
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:51,559
and then I scared.

86
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:53,549
And what happened?

87
00:06:54,722 --> 00:06:57,589
He pulled me out. Um...

88
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:00,958
And closed the door, and he said,

89
00:07:01,426 --> 00:07:04,770
"There are things your mother
doesn't ever need to know."

90
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:06,728
And you've never talked about it?

91
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,033
No.

92
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:14,573
I guess that... maybe that's
why I was so devastated

93
00:07:14,606 --> 00:07:15,864
when Nathan left me.

94
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:19,927
'Cause it confirmed my
biggest fear about marriage.

95
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:23,974
It's not to be trusted.

96
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:26,915
Well, I wouldn't give up on Ed.

97
00:07:29,386 --> 00:07:32,099
- All right?
- I really fucked up.

98
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:35,231
He's not gonna leave you. Not Ed.

99
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:40,028
How are you doing?

100
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,145
Have you had any more
early morning joyrides?

101
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:48,191
- Funny.
- No, I'm not...

102
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:50,575
being funny. It actually
really scared me.

103
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,239
What did Madam Shrink
have to say about that?

104
00:07:53,648 --> 00:07:56,448
She thinks it's somehow tied to me...

105
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,163
not being sufficiently over Perry.

106
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:07,458
Life just feels colorless now.
It just feels flat and dull.

107
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:14,739
As dead as he is, sometimes
I think maybe I'm deader.

108
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:18,573
- I was a better mother.
- No. Honey...

109
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,339
I was a better mother with him. I was.

110
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:22,676
- No! Don't say that.
- Yes. I was.

111
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:27,174
I need to find joy for them.

112
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:30,844
And he helps me with that.

113
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:44,260
Jane.

114
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,360
- Yeah?
- I'm Mary Louise Wright.

115
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:47,960
We may have met.

116
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:50,868
- I'm Max and Josh's grandmother.
- Yeah, hi.

117
00:08:50,893 --> 00:08:54,434
I'm sorry to trouble you
here at work, but, um...

118
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:59,032
Celeste has shared with me
some... interesting news.

119
00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:03,313
How would you feel about
submitting to a paternity test?

120
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,049
I mean, submitting Ziggy
to a paternity test.

121
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,297
I... Yeah, I don't need
to take a paternity test.

122
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:13,852
I know exactly who my son's father is.

123
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,188
Hmm. Even so...

124
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,922
I'm not asking you for anything.

125
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,923
No, I... I realize that.

126
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:20,799
I suppose I'm asking.

127
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:22,455
For what?

128
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,906
Well, I'm presented with
the idea that my son

129
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,907
was both an adulterer and a... a rapist,

130
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:31,908
and I am desperate to squash that idea.

131
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:36,252
Well, I can tell you that he's
the only man I'd been with.

132
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:38,479
That you recall.

133
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:39,860
Excuse me?

134
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:41,758
Well, things happen these days.

135
00:09:41,783 --> 00:09:44,000
Men put drugs in pretty girls' drinks,

136
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:47,009
and things happen. People
don't remember sometimes.

137
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:48,234
I remember.

138
00:09:49,014 --> 00:09:50,247
Perfectly.

139
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:53,390
Far more vividly than I care to.

140
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:57,092
- Just a simple blood test.
- No.

141
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:05,313
"What a tangled web we weave...

142
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,713
when first, we practice to deceive."

143
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:10,684
But Charlotte didn't say that.

144
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:12,063
She said, "Some Pig."

145
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:14,077
She didn't say anything
about a tangled web.

146
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,572
She certainly spun one.

147
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:18,282
I mean, she made
Wilbur out to be an outlier

148
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,751
when in truth, he was kinda ordinary.

149
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,520
So Ziggy...

150
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:26,018
does that make Charlotte a liar?

151
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:30,666
It makes her a grownup.

152
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:32,863
Lying to protect someone she loves,

153
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,164
that's what grownups do.

154
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:36,833
I think she was probably
just rebranding Wilbur.

155
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,439
Rebranding?

156
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:42,687
I see. Well... You all
want to know what I think?

157
00:10:42,712 --> 00:10:44,011
Mm-hmm.

158
00:10:44,036 --> 00:10:47,843
I think Charlotte didn't
want Wilbur to get eaten.

159
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:50,935
I don't think she wanted
any pigs to be eaten,

160
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,624
and we all know why, don't we?

161
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:55,385
Sustainability.

162
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,459
Exactly. Exactly.

163
00:10:57,484 --> 00:10:59,420
How many gallons of water does it take

164
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:01,357
to make a single pound of sausage?

165
00:11:01,382 --> 00:11:04,537
- A thousand.
- A thousand gallons.

166
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:06,329
And how many showers
does that add up to?

167
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:10,032
- Over 50.
- Over 50 showers.

168
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:14,045
So imagine, would you have to
take a shower every single day

169
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,226
for almost two months to...

170
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:24,384
Amabella, your mother's
gonna meet you at the hospital,

171
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:26,197
- okay, sweetie?
- I wanna go with her.

172
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:27,486
Yeah, yeah. We've got you covered.

173
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:28,878
Let me get her backpack. Sarah!

174
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:31,053
What the fu... What happened?

175
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:34,783
- Um, Mrs. Klein.
- What... I'm Amabella's mom.

176
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:38,094
Renata Klein. What...
What did she do? What's...

177
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:39,296
I'm Dr. Feldman.

178
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:41,808
Your daughter was brought
in with an anxiety attack.

179
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:42,998
Anxiety attack?

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,233
We've given her a mild sedative,

181
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:46,670
she's resting comfortably,
she's not in any danger.

182
00:11:46,695 --> 00:11:47,703
- She was in a little bit of...
- Can I see her?

183
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:49,086
... a shock when
she first came in, but...

184
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:50,876
- What?
- She's fine. She's resting comfortably.

185
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:52,334
- Okay.
- Yeah. Right back... Right this way.

186
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:54,092
What did you do?

187
00:11:57,763 --> 00:12:02,628
Did somebody hurt you
or say something or...

188
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:06,255
- No. I'm okay, Mom.
- Sweetheart.

189
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:10,246
You were discovered in a
closet practically unconscious.

190
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:13,161
- Was she checked for bite marks?
- Honey, come on.

191
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:15,697
She was bitten last year, right? So...

192
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:18,425
Maybe somebody's
bullying you again or...

193
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,448
- No...
- Hey baby, you okay there, my girl?

194
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:23,572
Don't talk to her. I got this, okay?

195
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:25,690
I think you've done enough, don't you?

196
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:28,448
You... What the hell
are you talking about?

197
00:12:28,473 --> 00:12:32,147
Gordon, she's obviously
under immense stress.

198
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:34,184
You think, Renata?

199
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:37,440
- Team. Team.
- Yes, hello, Doctor,

200
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,293
I would like my daughter
transferred to Stanford, please.

201
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,468
- Because?
- Because it's Stanford!

202
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:44,625
I mean, please.

203
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:46,327
Well, she's being released.

204
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:47,909
She's cleared for discharge.

205
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,848
- Oh, look at that.
- There we go.

206
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:52,482
Hey... Counseling is
certainly indicated.

207
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:53,919
Uh-huh.

208
00:12:53,944 --> 00:12:55,591
Perhaps for the entire family.

209
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:59,116
You don't know anything
about my family. Okay?

210
00:12:59,365 --> 00:13:02,910
I know your own stress...
not helping the situation.

211
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,154
"Your own stress..."

212
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,502
Please.

213
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:09,685
Honey, isn't that great?
We're gonna go home.

214
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,719
- You're going home!
- Don't talk to her.

215
00:13:14,923 --> 00:13:16,529
Will you ever forgive me?

216
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:18,888
Yes, of course, honey.
It's not your fault.

217
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:20,960
I blurted it out.

218
00:13:20,962 --> 00:13:23,129
The blurting is not the problem.

219
00:13:23,131 --> 00:13:25,060
My doing it is the problem.

220
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:28,868
Well, you're in therapy,
so that's good. Right?

221
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,068
Yeah...

222
00:13:30,816 --> 00:13:34,207
I mean... the doctor's
pretty much a crock.

223
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:37,420
She... She thinks
I feel like an empty sack

224
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:38,978
because I didn't graduate from college,

225
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,607
and that's why I'm obsessed
with your going.

226
00:13:42,225 --> 00:13:44,453
But that is not entirely true.

227
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:46,053
Mom...

228
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:48,664
I mean, when we would
watch <i>The Wizard of Oz,</i>

229
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,089
you would turn into a puddle

230
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:52,491
every time The Scarecrow
got his diploma.

231
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,697
Well, I'm glad you're back home.

232
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:00,833
Otherwise, I might be totally alone.

233
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:03,535
He's not gonna leave you.

234
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:11,344
- Hello!
- Oh!

235
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:15,368
We had such wonderful fun together!

236
00:14:15,393 --> 00:14:17,525
- Did you, honey?
- Yeah.

237
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,096
- Can Dr. Peep have a sleepover?
- Oh...

238
00:14:20,121 --> 00:14:23,654
Oh, sweetheart, I would love that,

239
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:25,797
but I need to get back to my sheep.

240
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:27,470
I'm afraid they'd miss me.

241
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:30,836
Could I talk to your parents
for a second in private?

242
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:32,601
Maybe you want to go play outside?

243
00:14:32,626 --> 00:14:34,848
- Look at the sunset!
- I promise to come see you again.

244
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:37,116
I'll bring tea and crumpets!

245
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:38,307
Cool!

246
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:40,538
I'll be right out.

247
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:43,484
We arranged all her
stuffies into a petting zoo.

248
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:44,941
It was wonderful!

249
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:52,460
Nobody's bullying her.

250
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:54,343
She's worried about
the end of the planet.

251
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:55,765
- What?
- Her class is evidently

252
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,069
talking about climate change,

253
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:59,089
and she's gotten the
message that we're doomed.

254
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:00,958
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, for fuck's sake...

255
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,460
You gotta be kidding me.

256
00:15:02,462 --> 00:15:04,477
She's also worried
about you going to jail.

257
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:05,711
Well, hello...

258
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:07,352
And she's worried about you.

259
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:09,287
Me?

260
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:11,054
She thinks something
is going on with you

261
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:12,610
and has been for a long time.

262
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:16,516
So there's you, you...

263
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:18,641
mostly the end of the world.

264
00:15:20,008 --> 00:15:21,641
Do you know if it's wild or farmed?

265
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:23,577
I believed it's farmed.

266
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,819
- Land based or net-pen?
- Sorry?

267
00:15:25,844 --> 00:15:27,602
Were they raised
on land-based facilities

268
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:28,883
or in net-pens in the ocean?

269
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:33,645
Well, um... it's a fish,
so I'm guessing the ocean.

270
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,771
Could you check?

271
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:38,060
- Sure...
- Thanks.

272
00:15:39,296 --> 00:15:40,379
S... Sorry.

273
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:41,531
It's okay.

274
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:43,224
You have to be careful
with some of the farm shit.

275
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,574
So you just eat wild?

276
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:48,438
Yeah. Yeah, mostly.
But there's problems there, too.

277
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,973
Some wild fish have tested
positive for microplastics.

278
00:15:50,998 --> 00:15:53,543
Some wild salmon have tested
positive for antidepressants.

279
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,283
People have to ask
where the fish come from,

280
00:15:57,308 --> 00:15:59,900
what they ate, how they lived,
even how they died.

281
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:00,982
If they're processed post-rigor,

282
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:04,375
the bacteria can leech
right into the flesh...

283
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:08,505
Sorry.

284
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:10,828
No, you don't have to apologize.

285
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,828
I used to work at Santa Monica Seafood,

286
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,163
so I was really into all this shit.

287
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:17,631
It's great. And you're
teaching me a lot.

288
00:16:17,656 --> 00:16:19,301
I'm trying to come off intelligent.

289
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:20,503
It's working.

290
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:27,416
I'm... I'm so sorry.

291
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:29,645
I'm so sorry to be such a nuisance.

292
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:32,244
Look, I was just... I was just wondering

293
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:35,002
if there are any new
developments in the case.

294
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:39,971
We told you we would call if there were.

295
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:42,721
Yes. Hmm...

296
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:46,798
I have personally worked
very hard to be mindful

297
00:16:46,823 --> 00:16:49,307
- of your unspeakable pain.
- I know you care.

298
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:52,190
I, perhaps, do seek out those who do.

299
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,588
I know you are not allowed to
say anything about the...

300
00:16:56,235 --> 00:16:59,916
case, or what you believe, but...

301
00:17:03,765 --> 00:17:04,998
A mother nee...

302
00:17:07,037 --> 00:17:08,870
A mother needs to know.

303
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:15,288
You don't believe my son just slipped...

304
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:19,914
do you?

305
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:24,180
You don't think it's healthy to... to...

306
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:26,232
To cling to the good memories?

307
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:28,936
It can be. I don't think so here.

308
00:17:28,938 --> 00:17:31,033
But there are so many positives.

309
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,330
So many. The way he loved me,
the way he loved the boys.

310
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,846
The boys loved him. I...

311
00:17:38,385 --> 00:17:42,415
I shouldn't erase all of that
simply because you feel that...

312
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,923
He almost killed you.

313
00:17:44,948 --> 00:17:46,383
He didn't almost kill me.

314
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:48,621
He nearly smothered you with a cushion.

315
00:17:48,823 --> 00:17:51,692
If one of his kicks had
landed on your head,

316
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:53,250
you might very well be dead.

317
00:17:57,401 --> 00:18:01,301
I work with and treat
quite a few veterans.

318
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:03,228
Many want to return to combat.

319
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:05,738
They can't handle the mundane.
Normal life is dull.

320
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:10,691
You miss the war, Celeste.

321
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:14,261
I miss what was good.

322
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,159
I don't miss what was bad.

323
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:19,485
And keeping him in my heart.
The good... The good part of him,

324
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:22,121
that works for me.
It works for the boys.

325
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:25,003
It works for my family. That works.

326
00:18:26,594 --> 00:18:29,528
How did you get that bruise on your arm?

327
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,877
I broke up a fight between the boys.

328
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,902
Mm-hmm.

329
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:35,246
Last week. I probably
got whacked or something.

330
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:38,814
Do you self-inflict your bruises?

331
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:41,039
- What?
- It's not uncommon.

332
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,980
Victims of abuse, sometimes,
they feel some...

333
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:47,071
attachment to their wounds.

334
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:50,636
Perhaps they remind you of him.

335
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:54,449
I do not self-inflict any wounds.

336
00:18:55,582 --> 00:18:57,755
And your other patients
do not inform on me.

337
00:18:57,757 --> 00:18:59,128
I'm not a statistic.

338
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,955
Are you addict, Celeste?

339
00:19:02,696 --> 00:19:04,096
Is Perry your drug?

340
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:09,900
I think it's really neat

341
00:19:09,902 --> 00:19:12,510
how passionate you are about things.

342
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:15,527
Thank you. Are you
passionate about things?

343
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,699
Um... yeah, of course,
I am. You know, I...

344
00:19:19,152 --> 00:19:22,313
I used to paint a lot.
I was really into art.

345
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:28,183
Now, I'm mostly passionate about my son.

346
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:32,189
I have a kid. I probably should've
told you that earlier,

347
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:34,998
but it's kind of
a weird thing to bring up.

348
00:19:36,563 --> 00:19:39,676
He's great. His name is Ziggy.
He's in second grade.

349
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:40,997
I would love to meet him.

350
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:43,857
Yeah, maybe one day.

351
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:47,136
I'm sure you guys would get along great.

352
00:19:47,138 --> 00:19:49,418
He knows a lot of random shit, too.

353
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:53,217
You guys could talk about
a lot of weird facts.

354
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:57,380
Um...

355
00:19:57,382 --> 00:19:59,529
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

356
00:20:01,123 --> 00:20:04,498
No, no, it's fine. It's uh... Not you.

357
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,600
I just gotta idle in neutral
for a little bit. That's...

358
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,701
kinda my M.O. right now.

359
00:20:13,235 --> 00:20:15,202
- Neutral. Okay.
- Yeah.

360
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:17,399
I can do that.

361
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:28,204
<i>I...</i>

362
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:33,774
<i>am... the greatest...</i>

363
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,047
<i>monster!</i>

364
00:20:36,072 --> 00:20:40,355
<i>And I come to devour...</i>

365
00:20:40,357 --> 00:20:43,124
<i>two young chickadees!</i>

366
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:44,978
My heavens!

367
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:48,572
He was the best monster.

368
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:50,883
Show her the angry beaver.

369
00:20:50,908 --> 00:20:52,330
Yeah, let me see that one.

370
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,035
Did your mom make this for you?

371
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:56,369
We all did.

372
00:20:58,409 --> 00:20:59,961
He sounds like a bear.

373
00:20:59,986 --> 00:21:01,720
He liked to combine animals.

374
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:04,750
- Yeah.
- Oh, here's the teacup one.

375
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:06,450
How we doing here?

376
00:21:07,148 --> 00:21:08,687
We're showing Grandma the memory book.

377
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:10,412
It's wonderful.

378
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:13,404
Here's <i>Guess How Much I Love You.</i>

379
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:14,867
That one's kinda boring.

380
00:21:14,892 --> 00:21:17,375
No, no, no. Let me...
I want to see that one.

381
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,604
- We loved that book.
- Okay...

382
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:23,474
<i>"He was almost too sleepy
to think anymore.</i>

383
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,500
<i>Then he looked beyond the thorn bushes,</i>

384
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:29,039
<i>out into the big dark night.</i>

385
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,656
<i>Nothing could be further than the sky.</i>

386
00:21:33,336 --> 00:21:36,576
<i>'I love you right up
to the moon,' he said,</i>

387
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:38,289
<i>and closed his eyes.</i>

388
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,092
<i>'Oh, that's far.
That is very, very far.'</i>

389
00:21:43,117 --> 00:21:45,836
<i>Big Nutbrown Hare settled
Little Nutbrown Hare</i>

390
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:47,528
<i>into his bed of leaves.</i>

391
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:49,990
<i>"He leaned over and
kissed him goodnight."</i>

392
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:51,537
<i>Right on the forehead.</i>

393
00:22:06,553 --> 00:22:08,618
Chloe said Amabella had a stroke.

394
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:11,106
She didn't have a stroke.
She just had a panic attack.

395
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:13,240
They're different. She's totally okay.

396
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,602
And Max thinks
she got possessed by Satan.

397
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,395
You can tell Max that he's wrong

398
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,537
because Satan can only be
so many places at once.

399
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,709
Come on, get in the car.
Let's go. Please get in the car.

400
00:22:27,427 --> 00:22:28,493
Ziggy...

401
00:23:09,993 --> 00:23:11,903
<i>That's Perry's brother, Raymond?</i>

402
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:12,905
<i>Yes.</i>

403
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,715
Oh my God, he looks just like Ziggy.

404
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,500
It... It's uncanny, isn't it?

405
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:20,139
Oh my God.

406
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:21,547
Wait, look.

407
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:25,453
They have the same cheeks. That's crazy.

408
00:23:25,478 --> 00:23:26,547
Wow...

409
00:23:27,258 --> 00:23:31,219
It's a bit... unsettling.

410
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:34,350
I should like to be
in Ziggy's life. I...

411
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:39,139
I mean, I'm... I'm his grandmother.

412
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:40,579
Yeah.

413
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,745
I just needed a... some time
to wrestle with that idea but...

414
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,879
Is he sweet?

415
00:23:48,808 --> 00:23:51,536
Yeah. He's the best.

416
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,444
My boys were so sweet.

417
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:56,888
I don't think there was a gentler

418
00:23:56,913 --> 00:24:01,889
or more tender little boy than Perry.

419
00:24:03,614 --> 00:24:07,517
He was so sweet and gentle.

420
00:24:09,694 --> 00:24:11,861
Um... grew up to be neither.

421
00:24:14,483 --> 00:24:17,163
This is perhaps an unfair question...

422
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:21,804
On the night of your...
rendez-vous with my son,

423
00:24:21,806 --> 00:24:24,061
who initiated the encounter?

424
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,642
Does that make a difference?

425
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,949
I know how devoted he was to Celeste,

426
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,663
and I... I just...

427
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:40,061
can't conceive how he...
Unless he was tempted.

428
00:24:40,866 --> 00:24:43,559
As men can be in a moment of weakness.

429
00:24:44,405 --> 00:24:46,819
Did you initiate, Jane?

430
00:24:47,957 --> 00:24:49,055
No.

431
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:55,318
You trying to apologize on his behalf?

432
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,428
To just... justify what he did?

433
00:24:57,756 --> 00:25:01,373
Celeste has shared with me
that she and Perry had a...

434
00:25:02,123 --> 00:25:04,412
a complicated sex life...

435
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:08,220
- one that included violence.
- She shared that with you?

436
00:25:09,068 --> 00:25:10,333
Yes.

437
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:15,401
And I'm... It makes me wonder if,
perhaps, he misinterpreted

438
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:18,127
or misread a signal from you.

439
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:21,197
Your son raped me...

440
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:23,298
and as he was doing so,

441
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,377
I was screaming for him to get off.

442
00:25:28,672 --> 00:25:30,869
I don't think that you "misread" that.

443
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,961
I don't mean to offend you, I just...

444
00:25:35,986 --> 00:25:40,353
It's... I just can't surrender
to this notion that he was...

445
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:45,806
evil. I can't...

446
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:51,438
I just do so want to be
believe there was good in him.

447
00:25:51,923 --> 00:25:55,503
I can't... did you see good in him?

448
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,440
Before the bad...
Did you see... good in him?

449
00:26:40,706 --> 00:26:43,915
It's literally like...
it couldn't be dumber.

450
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:45,946
I know! I know!

451
00:26:45,948 --> 00:26:47,964
- Hey.
- Hey! How are you?

452
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,612
Yeah, I'm good. Good.
What are you doing?

453
00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:54,431
Just, um... chattin'.

454
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:56,089
Having some coffee. What's up with you?

455
00:26:58,126 --> 00:26:59,823
You... You look better. Brighter.

456
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:01,519
Thanks.

457
00:27:07,323 --> 00:27:10,069
Um, I should get going to the studio.

458
00:27:10,344 --> 00:27:12,365
Yeah, I'll let you guys, um...

459
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,606
All right.

460
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,300
Thanks for the chat... and the laugh.

461
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:17,998
- Totally.
- I needed that, so...

462
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,412
- Good to see ya.
- Yeah, you too.

463
00:27:20,414 --> 00:27:21,480
Bye.

464
00:27:21,482 --> 00:27:23,382
- Bye, Maddie.
- Okay, bye.

465
00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:27,453
I should probably get going, too, here.

466
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:30,088
So... what were you talking about?

467
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,957
Her, uh, mother.

468
00:27:33,227 --> 00:27:35,732
It seems everyone has mother issues.

469
00:27:39,068 --> 00:27:40,920
How long are you gonna punish me?

470
00:27:41,654 --> 00:27:46,969
Well, for as long as
I need or want, I guess.

471
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:50,650
Wow, that was just cold and mean
when just a few seconds ago,

472
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:52,704
you were so warm
and friendly with Bonnie.

473
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:56,234
Yeah, I guess, that would be
sort of a twofer, wouldn't it?

474
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:58,751
Could piss off both you and
Nathan at the same time.

475
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:00,375
That's a good idea.

476
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,650
Well, that's just cruel, Ed.

477
00:28:04,564 --> 00:28:06,158
And you're not cruel.

478
00:28:06,626 --> 00:28:11,296
Well, whatever I am or have been

479
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:13,765
hasn't netted the desired results,

480
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:15,734
so why not mix it up?

481
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:22,148
<i>I don't even know who he is right now.</i>

482
00:28:22,173 --> 00:28:23,876
He'll play through it. He will.

483
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:25,301
He just...

484
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,384
He's just being so hateful.

485
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:30,828
How could I think even think
anything about my life is real?

486
00:28:30,853 --> 00:28:33,001
My first marriage was not real.

487
00:28:34,204 --> 00:28:36,148
My second marriage,
turns out I'm the fraud.

488
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,406
I can't even believe in myself anymore,

489
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:41,058
and, like, look at my friendships and...

490
00:28:42,447 --> 00:28:44,061
What about your friendships?

491
00:28:44,063 --> 00:28:46,263
I had no clue, Celeste.

492
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,765
I didn't even have the slightest idea

493
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,304
that you were living through that,

494
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,320
and it makes me feel like
you couldn't even tell me.

495
00:28:52,345 --> 00:28:53,938
- I'm sorry for keeping...
- Don't say sorry.

496
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,134
... this secret... But I am. It's...

497
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,015
If I was in your situation,
I probably...

498
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,142
Probably what?

499
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:02,812
Would have done
the same things as me? Hmm?

500
00:29:02,837 --> 00:29:05,369
- No, Madeline, you wouldn't.
- I don't know.

501
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:08,501
You would have been out
of that marriage so fast.

502
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:10,492
I wish.

503
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:12,889
I wish I had told you. I do.

504
00:29:16,115 --> 00:29:18,616
You would have jumped
into that pool, pulled me out.

505
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,164
What possesses
two idiots like yourselves

506
00:29:26,189 --> 00:29:28,820
to teach eight-year-olds
that the planet is doomed?

507
00:29:28,845 --> 00:29:31,318
The children are constantly
bombarded with climate change.

508
00:29:31,343 --> 00:29:32,883
It is all over the news.

509
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:36,112
It's our job to deconstruct it
so that they can process it.

510
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:39,845
Good for you. You deconstructed
my little girl into a coma.

511
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,306
Renata, look. We scheduled
an assembly for this evening.

512
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:44,487
Okay? You are not
the only parent complaining.

513
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:46,386
Just, by far, the loudest.

514
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,659
You're pitiful.

515
00:29:48,685 --> 00:29:51,552
Okay, this is gonna come
as a shock to you.

516
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:56,246
This school is actually here
to serve all the children,

517
00:29:56,271 --> 00:29:57,970
not just Amabella.

518
00:29:58,276 --> 00:30:00,824
You think 'cause of
this whole bankruptcy thing...

519
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:03,410
that the school thinks I don't matter?

520
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:05,213
Please.

521
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:08,104
I will be rich again. I will rise up.

522
00:30:08,129 --> 00:30:11,745
I will buy a fucking polar bear
for every kid in this school.

523
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,498
And then, I will squish you
like the bug that you are.

524
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:16,943
Pretends like he's not a smoker.

525
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:18,904
Hasn't been laid in 15 fucking years.

526
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:20,355
Don't you talk to me like that!

527
00:30:20,357 --> 00:30:23,139
And you, I can't be bothered
to squish you.

528
00:30:23,164 --> 00:30:24,748
You're a model citizen, Renata.

529
00:30:24,773 --> 00:30:25,927
I told you,

530
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:27,796
these second-grade mothers,
they are Shakespearean.

531
00:30:29,032 --> 00:30:32,500
That woman, she's
the fucking Medusa of Monterey.

532
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,736
And yes, I smoke.
Do you want one of these?

533
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:36,805
- Yes, please.
- Yeah, I got a spot outside

534
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:38,521
where the kids can't fucking see us.

535
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:40,764
Fuck them. Oh, my God, I am so livid.

536
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:42,043
- Okay, let's...
- I am so livid.

537
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:43,668
Let's go get a coffee or something.

538
00:30:43,773 --> 00:30:45,500
Please. The teacher was in on it.

539
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:47,521
He really said, "Go to hell?"

540
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:48,928
- Yeah, he's a shit.
- Oh, my God.

541
00:30:48,953 --> 00:30:50,250
They practically kill my daughter,

542
00:30:50,252 --> 00:30:54,170
and then he's just dismissing
me like that? What a pus-fuck.

543
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:55,826
- And then...
- Oh.

544
00:30:55,851 --> 00:30:58,373
Mary Louise. D-Did you find a place?

545
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,760
Maybe. Just saw one.

546
00:30:59,762 --> 00:31:00,994
Good, good, good.

547
00:31:00,996 --> 00:31:02,396
You know Renata Klein?

548
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:03,873
- We do...
- I don't believe I do.

549
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:07,686
We... We did meet.
At the funeral. I'm so sorry.

550
00:31:07,711 --> 00:31:10,414
- I was a friend of Perry's.
- You were there.

551
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:12,481
When he fell.

552
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:16,781
I was. That was, uh... devastating.

553
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:20,875
Mm-hmm. So sorry to interrupt.

554
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:23,626
- I...
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

555
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:26,343
- What... What... What the fuck is that?
- I don't know. She's very strange.

556
00:31:26,955 --> 00:31:28,488
Whoo!

557
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:30,412
- Whoo!
- Jane.

558
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:32,325
- Hey.
- Hi!

559
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:34,332
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

560
00:31:34,357 --> 00:31:35,832
- Just going for a run.
- How are you?

561
00:31:35,857 --> 00:31:37,463
- I'm good. How are you?
- I'm good.

562
00:31:37,465 --> 00:31:38,918
Oh, my gosh, that's so funny.

563
00:31:38,943 --> 00:31:41,122
Ziggy's learning to surf.
Corey's teaching him.

564
00:31:41,147 --> 00:31:42,576
This is getting kinda serious, huh?

565
00:31:42,607 --> 00:31:44,286
No, no... Told Ziggy about him

566
00:31:44,311 --> 00:31:46,567
and told him that he
was teaching me to surf,

567
00:31:46,592 --> 00:31:48,108
so of course, he wanted to learn.

568
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,209
Yeah.

569
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:50,341
Yeah.

570
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,042
He did try to kiss me
the other night, though.

571
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,445
- And?
- It was...

572
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:55,014
extremely awkward.

573
00:31:55,016 --> 00:31:57,549
I don't know. My body just shut down.

574
00:31:57,842 --> 00:31:59,232
Does he know about your history?

575
00:31:59,257 --> 00:32:00,489
Mm-mm. Not yet.

576
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,293
You should talk to him.

577
00:32:02,318 --> 00:32:04,248
I don't know if I'm ready for that.

578
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,333
Look, any real relationship
you're gonna have,

579
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,522
if you wanna have one...

580
00:32:09,655 --> 00:32:11,063
he's gotta know who you are, right?

581
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:13,299
Yeah. I guess that's true.

582
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:17,121
What?

583
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:19,921
I'm such a hypocrite.

584
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,350
Nathan has no idea who I am.

585
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:26,543
Oh, my God! Go, Ziggy! Go, baby, yes!

586
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:30,310
Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
Stand up! Ah, you're doing it!

587
00:32:35,658 --> 00:32:37,290
Turn that shit off.

588
00:32:43,286 --> 00:32:44,286
Three things:

589
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:46,264
one, we're throwing
Amabella a birthday party,

590
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:48,569
and I'm sparing no cost. She's unhappy.

591
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,512
Two, I had it out with Nippal.

592
00:32:50,537 --> 00:32:52,137
I've gotta go back to the school.

593
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:53,371
They wanna talk about climate change

594
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:56,075
and the end of the world,
which actually, if it comes,

595
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,820
- it might be a sweet relief.
- Damn right.

596
00:32:57,845 --> 00:33:00,294
And three, sell your fucking toys.

597
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,526
It's not just me, you know.

598
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:03,946
- Excuse me?
- Putting stress on Amabella.

599
00:33:03,971 --> 00:33:05,455
I mean, what I did didn't help,
of course, but...

600
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,581
- What did I do?
- You tell me.

601
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:10,821
I mean, when I first met you, you...

602
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:13,493
You had your guardrails
up to your earlobes.

603
00:33:13,518 --> 00:33:15,159
- Please.
- Penetrating you was like...

604
00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:17,595
It was like piercing a cement wall.

605
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:20,708
It took some time, but I eventually
chipped through, you know.

606
00:33:20,948 --> 00:33:23,434
Well, guess what? The last,
I don't know, 12 months or so,

607
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:25,073
the guardrails are back up.

608
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:27,238
Fuck, I mean you are here,
you're there, you're everywhere,

609
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,791
but you are never present,
and I feel it.

610
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:33,026
And Amabella feels it.

611
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:36,579
- Did she say that?
- I'm saying it.

612
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,557
Your husband is saying it.

613
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:43,637
There is something going on with you.

614
00:33:45,071 --> 00:33:46,330
Correct.

615
00:33:46,522 --> 00:33:48,955
My husband put us in the poorhouse.

616
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:50,715
Sell your shit.

617
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,041
First off, thank you all for coming

618
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:57,860
to a special evening
assembly at our wonderful,

619
00:33:57,885 --> 00:33:59,587
wonderful Otter Bay,

620
00:33:59,612 --> 00:34:01,766
and a special thanks to those parents

621
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:04,282
who took special time
out of their busy lives

622
00:34:04,307 --> 00:34:06,696
to reach out to me directly
about this important issue,

623
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:09,424
- so thank you.
- You're welcome. Yeah.

624
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:13,092
Now, as we all know,
anxiety is an epidemic

625
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,417
in our schools.

626
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,685
Really? It wouldn't be if
you weren't teaching them...

627
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:17,953
All right, let's take
a breath, everybody,

628
00:34:17,978 --> 00:34:19,920
and let's try and keep
this constructive, shall we?

629
00:34:20,343 --> 00:34:24,396
Climate change and the toll
that it takes on our students,

630
00:34:24,421 --> 00:34:26,544
it is a complicated matter, okay?

631
00:34:26,569 --> 00:34:27,930
That is why we called this ad hoc

632
00:34:27,955 --> 00:34:30,255
Golden Bell Award-winning assembly:

633
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,411
because not only will you hear from me,

634
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:35,071
we would love to hear
from you. The parents.

635
00:34:35,495 --> 00:34:36,649
Okay, hold up.

636
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,840
We've already told you
how we feel about it.

637
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:40,630
This is not how I want this to go.

638
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:42,209
Everybody, please sit down...

639
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:44,150
Shut up!

640
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:45,175
Really?

641
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,297
Are you seriously telling us to shut up?

642
00:34:47,322 --> 00:34:48,664
Madeline Mackenzie. Lovely.

643
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:51,086
Okay, since you've taken
this opportunity to speak up,

644
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:52,845
let us first hear from you.

645
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,345
Would you like to come up
here please, Madeline?

646
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,503
Why... Why me?

647
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:58,156
Because you're a beacon
among us, Madeline.

648
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:00,180
- Now, please, come up here.
- Fine. No, no, I'm fine.

649
00:35:00,205 --> 00:35:01,697
- Thank you.
- And make sure they know

650
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,632
- my daughter was in a coma.
- Okay. Okay, yeah.

651
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,205
Madeline Mackenzie, everyone. Please.

652
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:12,707
Just share your thoughts.

653
00:35:15,712 --> 00:35:18,361
I mean, where do
we even begin? Honestly?

654
00:35:18,548 --> 00:35:20,947
About everything?

655
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,820
I mean, Principal Nippal,
you have a very good point.

656
00:35:24,845 --> 00:35:27,287
Climate change is important.
It's important.

657
00:35:27,455 --> 00:35:30,625
But it's also a lot to load
up on a lot of second graders.

658
00:35:30,627 --> 00:35:31,806
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

659
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:34,331
That the whole world might go kapooey.

660
00:35:34,356 --> 00:35:35,556
They need to know that?

661
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:37,697
You know, I think part
of the problem is...

662
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:40,129
we lie to our kids.

663
00:35:40,361 --> 00:35:42,670
We fill their heads full of Santa Claus

664
00:35:42,695 --> 00:35:45,023
and stories with happy endings,
when most of us know

665
00:35:45,048 --> 00:35:47,818
most endings to most
stories fucking suck.

666
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:50,533
Right? Let's just get real.

667
00:35:51,553 --> 00:35:53,013
There aren't a lot of happy endings

668
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:54,536
for a lot of people, you know.

669
00:35:54,561 --> 00:35:57,998
Be it climate change,
be it guns in schools.

670
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,762
And our kids are afraid.
They're afraid to go to school.

671
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:03,547
They're afraid they're gonna get shot.

672
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:05,191
We don't prepare them.

673
00:36:05,193 --> 00:36:07,527
We fill their heads
full of happy endings

674
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:10,211
and happy stories and lies.

675
00:36:11,078 --> 00:36:13,070
And... And we tell them
things like, "You're fine."

676
00:36:13,095 --> 00:36:15,470
You're gonna be fine,"
and we tell ourselves...

677
00:36:16,252 --> 00:36:18,291
We tell ourselves we're gonna be fine.

678
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:20,072
But we're not.

679
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:23,664
You know that song that we used
to sing when we were little,

680
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:24,861
"The Rainbow Connection"?

681
00:36:24,886 --> 00:36:25,955
There's a line in it,

682
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,378
they talk about rainbows are illusions.

683
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:29,541
And then...

684
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,583
there's another line, and it goes on,

685
00:36:31,585 --> 00:36:32,875
and it says that, that...

686
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,892
"Who said every wish would be granted...

687
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:39,624
would be... if you wish
on a morning star."

688
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:40,743
Do you remember that?

689
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,455
But this is the part that I thought...

690
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:48,179
Is that "Somebody thought of that..."

691
00:36:49,713 --> 00:36:51,595
Then someone believed them.

692
00:36:52,106 --> 00:36:54,106
"And look what it's done..."

693
00:36:54,108 --> 00:36:56,445
We have to tell
the children that... that...

694
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,517
Life is an illusion and things
don't work out sometimes,

695
00:36:59,908 --> 00:37:02,898
and that... and... you can't
tell them part of the truth.

696
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:04,868
You have to tell them the whole truth.

697
00:37:15,744 --> 00:37:17,220
She's not picking up.

698
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:21,973
Um, is this a full blown breakdown
or something? I mean...

699
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:24,381
Too much to get up
there and help her, Ed?

700
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:27,572
Hmm? She's your fucking wife.

701
00:37:27,574 --> 00:37:29,973
Well, thanks for the tip, Celeste.

702
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:32,527
Maybe we could get coffee, you and me,

703
00:37:32,552 --> 00:37:35,446
and you could fill me in on
whatever else I've missed.

704
00:37:38,962 --> 00:37:41,234
You don't think he knows about...

705
00:37:41,754 --> 00:37:42,853
No.

706
00:37:57,737 --> 00:37:58,969
Where is he?

707
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:01,037
I don't know.

708
00:38:02,484 --> 00:38:03,836
Is he moving out?

709
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:07,982
Well, he hasn't packed his things yet.

710
00:38:18,681 --> 00:38:20,296
Well, I heard...

711
00:38:21,493 --> 00:38:23,926
about your speech tonight.

712
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:25,555
Can you get me some wine?

713
00:38:28,249 --> 00:38:29,537
He'll be back.

714
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:35,853
Thank you, honey.

715
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,684
- What are you doing?
- Oh, sweet Jesus!

716
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,522
You gave me such a fright.

717
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:54,513
Well... Okay, I won't lie.

718
00:38:54,538 --> 00:38:56,919
I have been having
trouble sleeping of late

719
00:38:56,952 --> 00:39:00,502
and so I thought you might
have a little helper or two.

720
00:39:01,031 --> 00:39:02,287
You're snooping.

721
00:39:02,312 --> 00:39:05,022
You have quite an impressive array.

722
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:11,071
I think it's probably best
if you find another place.

723
00:39:11,096 --> 00:39:13,832
Celeste, I am on your side.

724
00:39:14,027 --> 00:39:16,421
So you keep saying. Hmm.

725
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:17,702
Vicodin.

726
00:39:18,342 --> 00:39:21,372
You have to be so careful
of these opioids, dear.

727
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:23,451
Sometimes I needed it.

728
00:39:24,787 --> 00:39:26,186
For the pain.

729
00:39:32,836 --> 00:39:34,502
Like when after he kicked me.

730
00:39:44,538 --> 00:39:46,239
I had a really good time again.

731
00:39:56,733 --> 00:39:58,433
I'm not gonna try and kiss you.

732
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,216
But I would like to give
you a goodnight hug.

733
00:40:05,246 --> 00:40:06,512
How does that sound?

734
00:40:07,055 --> 00:40:08,488
That sounds great.

735
00:40:12,447 --> 00:40:15,083
- Okay.
- This is a weird hug.

736
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:20,575
We're touching.

737
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:23,443
- I'm blushing.
- How's it going?

738
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,549
Are we dancing? Is that...
Is that what this is?

739
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:32,378
Is that your secret scheme?
To get me to dance with you?

740
00:40:32,403 --> 00:40:33,886
It's really good idea, yeah.

741
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:35,597
I'm not that smooth, but yeah,

742
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:37,731
I guess we could dance
if you want to dance, sure.

743
00:40:56,911 --> 00:40:58,153
<i>Hey, Sparkles.</i>

744
00:40:59,914 --> 00:41:01,919
<i>I'm just calling to say good night.</i>

745
00:41:02,516 --> 00:41:05,918
<i>But you've probably already gone to bed.</i>

746
00:41:08,336 --> 00:41:10,302
<i>I'm having a little trouble sleeping.</i>

747
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:13,872
<i>And I was hoping you could help me.</i>

748
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:19,598
<i>But I guess I'm on my own.</i>

749
00:41:21,649 --> 00:41:23,817
<i>Though not really.</i>

750
00:41:24,137 --> 00:41:26,145
<i>I can just close my eyes and...</i>

751
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:30,372
<i>and pretend that you're here.</i>

752
00:41:35,381 --> 00:41:36,848
<i>I love you, baby.</i>

753
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,582
<i>Love you.</i>

754
00:42:50,087 --> 00:42:53,487

3
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:07,312
Get up.

4
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:11,649
Celeste, you're fine.

5
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:13,818
Oh...

6
00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:15,486
Hey.

7
00:02:15,572 --> 00:02:17,539
Uh...

8
00:02:17,624 --> 00:02:18,990
Hey.

9
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:20,575
Hey, you just got the
wind knocked out of you.

10
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,410
Mom, we got to go.

11
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:26,414
Hey, hey, hey.

12
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:29,334
Hey, Mommy isn't feeling well today,

13
00:02:29,386 --> 00:02:31,135
so I'm going to take you guys to school.

14
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:32,921
What's wrong with her?

15
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:34,138
Her tummy's a little upset.

16
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:35,807
She's... she's okay.

17
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:39,644
But that means that the monster
will take you to school instead.

18
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:42,430
I'll be right down, guys.

19
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,797
I'm sorry, Sparkles.

20
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:25,773
The only mystery to me is
why all the damn questions?

21
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,609
I mean, you know who
did it, for God's sake.

22
00:03:27,694 --> 00:03:31,279
Chloe, there's a zero-tolerance
policy on tardiness, young lady.

23
00:03:31,364 --> 00:03:33,398
- Let's go.
- Coming, woman.

24
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,983
Get your butt over here.

25
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:36,534
Well, she still has yet to launch it.

26
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,536
That's a good sign.

27
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:41,823
Abigail... there's no sign of
a launch on her Facebook page.

28
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:45,710
So you're Facebook stalking her after
you got up on your Clydesdale about it?

29
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:47,912
What exactly did you say to her, anyway?

30
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:50,632
Common sense... I said live
right or go straight to hell.

31
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:52,300
Are you having your period?

32
00:03:52,385 --> 00:03:53,751
Get in the car.

33
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:55,219
Are you?

34
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:56,504
Are you trying to be funny?

35
00:03:56,589 --> 00:03:59,307
Trying to be serious.
What is going on with you?

36
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:01,259
I have to get her to school.

37
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:22,080
You sure it was Tori?

38
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:24,082
Does she drive a gray Saturn?

39
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:27,201
She was just driving
slowly by your house?

40
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:28,703
Clearly she knows about us, Joseph.

41
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:30,838
First of all, she flat-out accuses me,

42
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:32,373
and now she's going all Glenn Close?

43
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,791
She suspects, she doesn't know.

44
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:35,376
I did a good job of denying it.

45
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:39,347
Not that my capacity for denial
would be a fraction of yours.

46
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:40,631
Yeah, well, I'm busy.

47
00:04:44,304 --> 00:04:46,804
- The thing about you, Madeline, is that...
- The thing about me?

48
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:48,189
Let me finish!

49
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:50,641
Central to your core is your grossly,

50
00:04:50,694 --> 00:04:53,394
if not artificially inflated,
sense of moral integrity.

51
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,530
For you to be fucking
me for three months

52
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:57,448
- like a mad hyena in heat...
- How dare you speak to me like that?

53
00:04:57,534 --> 00:04:58,900
...could only mean that, yes,
not only were you in love with me,

54
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:00,318
you had the best sex of your life.

55
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:02,537
You've gone so far in
the direction of wrong.

56
00:05:02,622 --> 00:05:04,155
Oh, yeah? Then why are you here?

57
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,990
You could've called me.

58
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:07,658
What, you wanna fuck
me again? Let's do it.

59
00:05:07,744 --> 00:05:08,910
There's no one in the building.

60
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:11,045
On the couch, come on. Me and you.

61
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,834
What, you think you own this
town 'cause you have money,

62
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:18,720
you self-entitled rich bitch?

63
00:05:18,805 --> 00:05:21,005
Just get the fuck out of my office!

64
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,062
I'll see you at the party tonight.

65
00:05:54,507 --> 00:05:56,758
Tsk, oh, God.

66
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:06,217
Don't touch me, please. Just...

67
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:11,105
I got the apartment.

68
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:16,360
Are you in it?

69
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:18,563
Is the refrigerator stocked?

70
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,566
You going to leave him?

71
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:29,207
He's going away in the morning, so...

72
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:30,491
Okay.

73
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:32,410
We just have to go to the
school gala tonight and...

74
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:35,546
Oh, Jesus.

75
00:06:35,632 --> 00:06:36,798
It's one thing should he kill you,

76
00:06:36,883 --> 00:06:38,316
but God forbid you miss a party.

77
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:41,803
You know, your husband is
ill, Celeste, but so are you.

78
00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:48,926
There are... children in the house.

79
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:51,896
I told you, he will
not hurt the children.

80
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:54,682
He will never hurt the children.

81
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,318
God!

82
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:01,022
It's all right, I'm fine.

83
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,996
Yeah, I sent the invoice 12 days ago.

84
00:07:09,082 --> 00:07:12,383
Great, I appreciate
it. Thank you so much.

85
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:13,668
Bye.

86
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:24,962
How's it looking?

87
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:26,848
98.6.

88
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:28,850
It doesn't get more normal than that.

89
00:07:30,436 --> 00:07:32,854
All right, buddy, tell
me what's going on.

90
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:35,806
You've had two bowls of cereal,

91
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:38,192
you're watching cartoons,
you don't have a fever.

92
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:40,478
Do you actually feel sick

93
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:41,979
or do you just not want to go to school?

94
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:44,031
I feel sick.

95
00:07:44,117 --> 00:07:46,117
You don't sound congested.

96
00:07:46,202 --> 00:07:47,235
I have aches.

97
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:50,905
Is it possible your heart aches

98
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,157
'cause the other kids were
told not to play with you?

99
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:54,959
'Cause I would certainly
understand that.

100
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:56,427
Friends play with me.

101
00:07:56,496 --> 00:08:00,331
Josh, Chloe, Skye, Amabella.

102
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,200
Amabella Klein plays with you?

103
00:08:02,268 --> 00:08:04,669
Yeah, we're friends.
She likes Star Wars, too.

104
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:08,072
It's not me who hurts her.

105
00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:10,341
I know, baby.

106
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,763
Do you know who is hurting her?

107
00:08:19,352 --> 00:08:20,568
Who is it?

108
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:25,239
I don't like to talk about it.

109
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:28,359
Well, you don't have a choice.
You have to talk about it.

110
00:08:28,428 --> 00:08:30,244
Tell me who it is.

111
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:32,747
I promised.

112
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:34,248
Look, sometimes it is important

113
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:35,700
to keep promises, but other times...

114
00:08:35,752 --> 00:08:38,202
- No, I promised.
- Who did you promise?

115
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:40,338
I promised Amabella.

116
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:43,174
You've known all of this time and
you've just been taking the blame?

117
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,642
I only just found out.

118
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:46,277
Who is it?

119
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:49,547
She said if I told, she
might get killed dead.

120
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:50,648
She...

121
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:55,052
Okay.

122
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:57,471
You promised her you
wouldn't say anything, right?

123
00:08:57,557 --> 00:09:00,224
But you can still point.

124
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,442
Right?

125
00:09:03,112 --> 00:09:06,230
You point and show me who it is...

126
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:09,317
and I promise you Amabella
will not get killed dead.

127
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:10,985
Who is it?

128
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:14,905
Ziggy, look at me.

129
00:09:16,743 --> 00:09:19,577
Amabella has been a really
good friend to you, right?

130
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:20,828
Yeah.

131
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:22,630
It's our turn to be
a good friend to her.

132
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:24,215
It's not fair that
she keeps getting hurt.

133
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,284
We have to protect her, right?

134
00:09:28,004 --> 00:09:30,421
Ziggy, point to who it is.

135
00:09:35,478 --> 00:09:36,811
- Really?
- I don't know what to do.

136
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:38,429
Well, you have to tell Celeste.

137
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:40,097
She's going to want to
hear it directly from you.

138
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:42,433
Honesty is always the best
policy, that's what I...

139
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,904
I mean, I knew the
boys roughhouse a lot,

140
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,656
but I didn't know they were bullies.

141
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:49,940
- It was only Max.
- Hey.

142
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:51,659
Ziggy was very clear about that.

143
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:53,327
Are you so relieved about Ziggy?

144
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:55,363
- Yeah.
- Hi, sorry... to interrupt.

145
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:56,530
Hi, Madeline.

146
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:58,449
Jane, Gordon Klein, Renata's husband.

147
00:09:58,534 --> 00:10:00,251
- We met at the school that day.
- Yeah, of course.

148
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:02,336
I'm wondering if we might
have a private conversation

149
00:10:02,422 --> 00:10:03,621
just for a second.

150
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:04,789
- Sure.
- Yeah?

151
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:07,625
Well, I'm feeling a little excluded.

152
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:09,677
We're in the middle of a conversation.

153
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:11,846
Okay. Actually, no, that's good.

154
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:16,634
You need to hear this since the two of you
seem to be making quite the little team.

155
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:22,807
Look, Jane, whether or not Ziggy is
the one who's been hurting Amabella,

156
00:10:22,892 --> 00:10:24,642
- you're the one who...
- Actually, there's...

157
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:27,862
...you're the one who attacked my wife.

158
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,952
Now, please understand that if
you ever go near Renata again,

159
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:36,704
I'll be taking a restraining order...

160
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:38,372
All right, all right.
Gordon, that's enough.

161
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,041
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

162
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:42,660
Tom, Tom. We're just
talking. Everything is fine.

163
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:46,163
No, no, everything's not fine. I can't
have you in here harassing my customers.

164
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:49,967
Now, I'm asking you politely, please.

165
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:51,836
- I don't think you have the right...
- Please go.

166
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:54,255
I don't think you have the right
to remove me from the premises.

167
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,173
I'm not interested in your legal advice.

168
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:59,560
Just go, Gordon.

169
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:01,846
Just remember what I said, okay?

170
00:11:01,898 --> 00:11:03,264
Mm-hmm.

171
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:04,899
- Okay?
- Yes.

172
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:08,007
Madeline.

173
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,851
Look, I'm sure I'll see you
some other time,

174
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:11,322
just not today, okay?

175
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:13,774
You just lost yourself a
lot of customers, my friend.

176
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,332
Unbelievable.

177
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:22,450
I'm so sorry.

178
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:23,834
That was really impressive.

179
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,703
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

180
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:28,005
You're a real prince, Tom. I
would've told him to go fuck himself.

181
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:30,424
But I don't talk like that.

182
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,761
All right, I'm off to transform
myself into My Fair Lady.

183
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:35,546
- Call Celeste, okay?
- I will.

184
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:37,598
- Bye, Tom.
- Bye.

185
00:11:37,683 --> 00:11:40,184
You know, uh, I've actually been

186
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:42,553
trying to figure out a way to
impress you for a while now.

187
00:11:42,605 --> 00:11:44,889
I just haven't had my chance.

188
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:47,441
You... you're straight?

189
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:49,393
What?

190
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:54,448
How was your day, baby-cakes?

191
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:57,151
Well, TGIF.

192
00:11:57,236 --> 00:11:58,569
Ugh, you're telling me.

193
00:11:58,654 --> 00:12:01,372
I was either starting
fights today or joining in.

194
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:03,040
Hey, Maddie!

195
00:12:03,126 --> 00:12:04,492
Hey.

196
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:10,631
Are you ready for Trivia Night
tonight? You're coming, I presume.

197
00:12:10,716 --> 00:12:12,583
Yeah, I'll be the one
dressed as Audrey Hepburn.

198
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:14,135
That's funny.

199
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,504
Listen, um, Bonnie and I
went to see a counselor today,

200
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:18,005
one that specializes in teenagers.

201
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,340
And I just wanted to
share something with you.

202
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:21,892
Wait a second, you
went to see a counselor?

203
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:23,144
Yeah.

204
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,934
He thinks that this is a kind
of, um, scream for attention.

205
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:33,154
- Mm.
- Divorce messes kids up pretty good.

206
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:35,906
Oh, so splitting up can
negatively affect the kids?

207
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:37,858
Wish I had known that
before I walked out.

208
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:39,276
Wait, did I?

209
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:41,745
Why do you gotta turn
everything into a fucking fight?

210
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:43,364
You know what, Nathan?

211
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,500
I'm glad you're taking this
parenting thing seriously.

212
00:12:46,586 --> 00:12:48,169
I really am.

213
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:52,790
You know, despite all of
our shit, I root for you.

214
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:56,677
I appreciate that.

215
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,387
Oh, uh, just so you know,

216
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:08,889
Bonnie is going to be singing
tonight at the talent thingy.

217
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:10,975
Maddie, she's good.

218
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,644
She's, like, really good.

219
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:14,895
Good to know.

220
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:21,869
Knowing what I know now,

221
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:24,488
I'm surprised there wasn't
more carnage on Trivia Night.

222
00:13:24,574 --> 00:13:27,291
One dead? We definitely got off light.

223
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,446
Oh.

224
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:34,168
Hello?

225
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:46,964
- Hey.
- Hi.

226
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,515
Thank you for meeting me.

227
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:51,852
What is it?

228
00:15:54,106 --> 00:15:55,639
Ziggy...

229
00:15:56,859 --> 00:16:01,278
Ziggy told me this morning that...

230
00:16:01,364 --> 00:16:06,483
apparently, it was Max who
choked Amabella at orientation.

231
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:10,154
And apparently, it's been him
who's been bullying her all along.

232
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,791
What?

233
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:15,376
Yeah.

234
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:17,828
Amabella told Ziggy, but
made him promise not to tell

235
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,414
because Max threatened to
hurt her more if it got out,

236
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:22,883
so he's just been keeping the secret.

237
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:25,969
You're sure about this?

238
00:16:26,055 --> 00:16:27,888
I mean, I definitely considered

239
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:31,675
that he could be lying
just to protect himself.

240
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:35,512
And I have to face the fact that
violence could be in his DNA,

241
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:37,231
given who his dad is.

242
00:16:38,818 --> 00:16:41,185
I think he's telling the truth.

243
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:45,656
He said also that Max
pushed Skye down the stairs,

244
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:50,494
um, and that he's been a little
aggressive towards her as well.

245
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,700
I'm so sorry, Celeste, to tell you this.

246
00:16:58,337 --> 00:17:00,204
They're kids, though, you know.

247
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:02,539
They bully. It's human nature.

248
00:17:02,591 --> 00:17:04,425
They grow out of it.

249
00:17:08,013 --> 00:17:10,464
Sometimes they don't.

250
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:34,204
Kelly, can I just have a moment, please?

251
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,540
Yeah, of course.

252
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,791
Max.

253
00:17:40,913 --> 00:17:43,630
Come here.

254
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:44,915
What?

255
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:56,426
You need to tell me what
you've been doing at school.

256
00:17:56,512 --> 00:17:58,312
You're not gonna get in trouble,

257
00:17:58,397 --> 00:17:59,930
but you gotta tell me the truth.

258
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:01,181
Do you understand?

259
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:08,605
We all do bad
things sometimes, all right?

260
00:18:10,493 --> 00:18:13,944
I can help you with them, but
you need to tell me.

261
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:17,664
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

262
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:26,757
And then he said,
"I'll see you tonight,"

263
00:18:26,842 --> 00:18:29,710
which sounded like a threat.

264
00:18:29,795 --> 00:18:33,180
I seriously doubt he's
gonna blow up his life.

265
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:39,887
Why did you wanna blow up yours?

266
00:18:47,313 --> 00:18:49,196
I wish I knew the answer to that.

267
00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:53,984
I can't really make sense of it.

268
00:18:58,073 --> 00:18:59,540
I think maybe...

269
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:04,244
sometimes I'm just holding on

270
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,665
to this idea of perfection so tight...

271
00:19:10,753 --> 00:19:12,803
something has to give.

272
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:14,888
And I can't explain it.

273
00:19:14,974 --> 00:19:16,890
And I won't excuse it.

274
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:20,427
I've been wanting to
tell Ed for so long.

275
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:25,766
I just haven't found the courage.

276
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:28,986
Yet.

277
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:31,071
I decided not to go through with it.

278
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:34,858
- The project.
- Oh, thank God.

279
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:39,863
It was pointed out to me, not by Bonnie,

280
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:41,999
that whatever attention
I bring to the cause

281
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:44,368
will be buried under the
controversy of my methodology,

282
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:45,936
so I'm gonna find another way.

283
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:51,208
Maybe I never really wanted to do it.

284
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,794
It was more of a publicity stunt,

285
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:55,512
you know, to raise awareness.

286
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:57,214
And to piss off your mom?

287
00:19:59,101 --> 00:20:00,300
Don't start.

288
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:09,726
I really wish you hadn't
confronted them like that.

289
00:20:09,812 --> 00:20:12,896
I'm not just gonna stand
around and do nothing.

290
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:15,983
Oh great, I'm the one
that's getting vilified.

291
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:18,068
Why would you be the
one to get vilified?

292
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:20,203
Because I'm a working
mom, I've told you.

293
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:23,073
Worse, a CEO, which deems me a bitch.

294
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,825
You have no idea.

295
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,743
If I get shot in the head tonight,

296
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:28,996
half these moms are gonna say,

297
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:31,248
"She couldn't bother herself to duck?

298
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,301
What, what, she couldn't get
the nanny to stop the bullet?"

299
00:20:34,386 --> 00:20:38,805
Trust me, these women, especially
Madeline, they're vicious.

300
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:40,390
Let's blow this off tonight.

301
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:42,225
I'm serious.

302
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:45,479
Let's... let's just... let's not go.

303
00:20:45,564 --> 00:20:49,566
Then we're demonized for
blowing off a fundraiser?

304
00:20:49,652 --> 00:20:50,517
No!

305
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:52,185
"What, the rich people,

306
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:55,856
they spend their money, but
they don't have the wherewithal

307
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:58,025
to even show up and invest their time?"

308
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,277
That's not gonna work. Sorry!

309
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:02,913
Sorry, no. I hate everybody right now,

310
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:05,832
except Jane, believe it or not.

311
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:08,702
How funny is that?

312
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:15,175
Go get ready, Elvis.

313
00:21:28,774 --> 00:21:31,274
This feels very dangerous.

314
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:34,978
We're already late for the party

315
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,365
and you have the temerity to
stand in the shower like this?

316
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:41,952
Do we really have to be on time?

317
00:21:42,037 --> 00:21:44,538
Sorry to say we do.

318
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:48,709
Well, I'm not gonna budge.

319
00:21:48,794 --> 00:21:50,877
Not until you at least give me a kiss.

320
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:15,018
- Hey.
- You look really pretty!

321
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,487
- Thank you!
- You really do.

00:22:17,573 --> 00:22:19,189
Oh, thanks!

323
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,991
I don't know how I'm gonna
survive in these heels all night.

324
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:23,443
Well, you look exactly
like Audrey Hepburn.

325
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:25,195
Aw, thank you.

326
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:28,415

I don't normally either, but
Madeline roped me into it.

332
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:47,884
Mm-hmm. I rode my bike
here and got us an Uber.

333
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,770

- Of course.

- Okay.

So, did you plan on telling me?

438
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:28,808
Or was I just to discover you
gone when I got back from Hawaii?

00:28:36,234 --> 00:28:37,400

442
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:38,868

You have to think about the boys.

448
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:17,607
Max is the one that was
hurting Amabella Klein.

449
00:29:17,692 --> 00:29:19,776
It wasn't Ziggy Chapman, it was Max.

450
00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:22,362
- How do you know?
- Because I asked him and he admitted it

451
00:29:22,447 --> 00:29:24,864
and Josh said it was true.

452
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:28,284
Okay. Well, we'll...
we'll talk to the teachers.

00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:30,787
No, I will talk to the teachers.

Jesus, open the fucking door, Perry.

455

- We will talk to the teachers together.

00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:39,963
- Open the door.
- Mother and father, husband and wife.

457
00:29:40,015 --> 00:29:41,931
And I will talk to Max tomorrow morning

458
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:43,216
before I leave for the airport.

459
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:45,134
And what are you gonna say to him?

460
00:29:45,203 --> 00:29:47,103
It's not the way a man
should treat a woman?

461
00:29:47,189 --> 00:29:49,189
That men should never hit women?

462
00:29:49,274 --> 00:29:52,442
Come on, is it
any wonder that it was him?

463
00:29:52,527 --> 00:29:55,144
- The boys have never seen anything.
- You don't know that.

464
00:29:55,197 --> 00:29:56,896
And if they haven't seen
it, they've heard it.

465
00:29:56,982 --> 00:29:59,148
They know what their
father does to their mother.

466
00:30:02,654 --> 00:30:04,487
You can't leave. You... you...

467
00:30:04,573 --> 00:30:06,823
We... can we, uh...
can we talk about it?

468
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:08,491

change. You know that.

Again.

645
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,399
I didn't mean to offend. Sorry.

646
00:41:07,485 --> 00:41:09,201
No, I think you did, Nathan.

647
00:41:09,287 --> 00:41:10,736
I think you did mean to offend.

648
00:41:10,821 --> 00:41:12,388
I don't think you're sorry, actually.

649
00:41:12,456 --> 00:41:14,073
What's wrong, Ed, man?

650
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:15,824
You're not happy with
your performance up there?

651
00:41:15,877 --> 00:41:17,326
Yeah?

652
00:41:17,378 --> 00:41:19,161
You're gonna get your ass
kicked tonight, you know that?

653
00:41:19,247 --> 00:41:20,713
Baby?

654
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:23,549
Ed, that was great.

655
00:41:26,754 --> 00:41:29,338
- Okay, what's going on?
- Nothing, nothing. Just the usual.

656
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,806
- Ed's being a dick and...
- Let's do it.

657
00:41:30,892 --> 00:41:32,508
For God's sakes, what
is wrong with you two?

658
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,176
He's been trying to pick
a fight with me for weeks.

659
00:41:34,228 --> 00:41:36,228
- I'm standing up for Madeline, dick!
- Stop it.

660
00:41:36,314 --> 00:41:37,563
Will you relax?

661
00:41:37,648 --> 00:41:38,847
- Oh!
- Oh, God.

662
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,516
I personally saw Ed Mackenzie

663
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:43,152
throw his drink at Bonnie Carlson.

664
00:41:43,237 --> 00:41:44,603
I'm afraid to tell him.

665
00:41:44,689 --> 00:41:46,021
I mean, I want to tell him,

666
00:41:46,073 --> 00:41:48,157
but I'm afraid I will hurt him so bad.

667
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:50,075
- I'm so sorry.
- But I can't do that to him.

668
00:41:50,161 --> 00:41:53,245
- ...Nathan Carlson!
- Oh, God.

669
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:57,833
- Babe, it's okay.
- Here, let me...

670
00:41:57,919 --> 00:41:59,201
Ed, it's fine.

671
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:00,419
Go on, your turn, baby.

672
00:42:00,504 --> 00:42:01,870
Just go. Baby, go.

673
00:42:01,956 --> 00:42:03,956
Baby, I'm all right.

674
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:05,257
Go knock them down.

675
00:42:05,343 --> 00:42:07,509
...truly wonderful.

676
00:42:07,595 --> 00:42:10,045
Okay.

677
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:13,432
One more time, Nathan Carlson!

678
00:42:13,517 --> 00:42:15,517
Hey, here he comes. Here we go.

679
00:42:15,603 --> 00:42:17,303
- Go get 'em, guy.
- I'm sorry.

I was talking to Celeste

699
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,156
and she told me that it wasn't Ziggy.

I've treated you and

It's okay. It's...

No apology necessary. Thank you.

704
00:44:12,053 --> 00:44:16,505
And my husband was so, um,
inappropriate and out of line.

705
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:19,558
I did try to poke your
eye out, in his defense.

706
00:44:19,643 --> 00:44:21,393
I clearly deserved it.

- No.

I... I appreciate your concern,

734
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:07,533
but I'm talking to my wife, not you.

735
00:46:07,618 --> 00:46:09,501
Celeste, let's... let's just go now.

736
00:46:09,587 --> 00:46:11,286
- We have to talk about it.
- No!

737
00:46:11,372 --> 00:46:13,338
I'm not coming home with you.

738
00:46:13,424 --> 00:46:16,041
So, just don't do this in front
of everyone, do you understand?

739
00:46:16,126 --> 00:46:18,877
I'm not going with you.

740
00:47:44,848 --> 00:47:47,633
Ma'am, stop moving, please.

741
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:51,470
Victim's on the back terrace.

742
00:47:55,025 --> 00:47:57,225
How compromised is the scene?

743
00:47:57,311 --> 00:47:59,394
They did a pretty good job of it.

744
00:48:12,326 --> 00:48:14,826
Already dead when we arrived.

745
00:48:31,595 --> 00:48:32,678
Oh, my God.

746
00:49:37,161 --> 00:49:39,661
...to, uh...

747
00:49:39,747 --> 00:49:41,329
to kick me again.

748
00:49:41,415 --> 00:49:44,800
And... and I think that's when he...

749
00:49:44,885 --> 00:49:48,670
he must've taken a step
back and... and he fell.

750
00:49:48,756 --> 00:49:49,755
Turn it off.

751
00:49:51,058 --> 00:49:52,674
I'm so sick of these fucking lies.

752
00:49:52,726 --> 00:49:54,593
I got up and...

753
00:49:57,231 --> 00:49:58,597
It wasn't an accident.

754
00:50:00,901 --> 00:50:01,850
Because?

755
00:50:04,188 --> 00:50:05,570
Their language.

756
00:50:06,573 --> 00:50:07,589
It's all the same.

757
00:50:09,076 --> 00:50:10,776
The husband, when he got
violent with the wife,

758
00:50:10,861 --> 00:50:12,277
he didn't trip and fall.

759
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:15,664
He was pushed.

760
00:50:15,749 --> 00:50:18,500
All right, so self-defense case, then.

761
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:20,702
She fought back, he tripped.

762
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:22,871
Involuntary manslaughter.

765
00:50:28,629 --> 00:50:30,095

766

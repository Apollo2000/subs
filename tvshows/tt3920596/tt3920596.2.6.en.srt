People file for bankruptcy
all the time.

2
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:12,255
You really don't get to settle
anything anymore, Mr. Klein;

3
00:00:12,342 --> 00:00:13,396
that all falls on me.

4
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:16,652
We're not moving in a circle.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,701
We're exploring the space.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,467
You can trust me to love you.

7
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:23,154
If I fuck up again,
it will not be with infidelity.

8
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:26,795
I was protecting you...

9
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:29,927
the best way I could,
by keeping the peace.

10
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:33,099
K... Kill me.

11
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:36,818
We need to do what's best
for the boys.

12
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:39,050
There are so many possibilities

13
00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:40,896
should this go to court,
Celeste.

14
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:42,693
A lot of them bad.

15
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:44,570
I'm gonna have to testify,

16
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:47,177
and that means that
I'm fair game.

- I did it. I did it.</i>

41
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:59,587

42
00:02:59,674 --> 00:03:03,658

43
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:06,760
<i>Call an ambulance!</i>

00:03:16,177 --> 00:03:17,677
<i>What the fuck!</i>

45
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,532
You're a cop?

46
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,861
No, I'm not a cop.

47
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:39,321
Well, what the fuck
were you doing there?

48
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:41,032
- I... I was...
- Bonnie saw you.

49
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,352
Do you want to come in?

50
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:45,866
I can explain.

51
00:03:45,954 --> 00:03:47,567
Yeah, you better
fucking explain.

52
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:49,108
Okay, um...

53
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,373
I... I was called in
for questioning.

54
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:54,064
More like ordered.

55
00:03:54,204 --> 00:03:55,259
By who?

56
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:59,358
- Um... Detective Quinlan.
- What did she say?

57
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:02,858
She asked me about us and you
and...

58
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:04,887
she asked whether
you had talked to me

59
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:06,741
about Perry Wright's death.

60
00:04:08,928 --> 00:04:11,005
- What did you tell her?
- I told her the truth,

61
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:12,741
that you didn't
tell me anything.

62
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:15,793
But Jane, she knows your history
with this guy.

63
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,746
She knows he raped you,
she knows he's Ziggy's dad,

64
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,717
and she clearly doesn't think
he slipped.

65
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:22,465
I know.

66
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:26,129
She said with five witnesses,

67
00:04:26,217 --> 00:04:28,128
the odds are in her favor...

68
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:30,709
one of you will finally crack.

69
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:33,211
The first one who does
gets a break.

70
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:34,873
The other four are fucked.

71
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:42,358
He went to, uh...

72
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:46,616
to kick me again and...

73
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,878
and I think that's when he...
He must have taken a step back

74
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:52,780
and... and he fell.

75
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:58,631
I don't really remember
because he stumbled back.

76
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:03,461
And that must have been
when he fell.

77
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:12,201
Is there anything
else that you would like to add?

78
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:19,131
I feel, um...

79
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:25,975
I just feel like...

80
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,483
I don't have a proper...

81
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:33,481
memory of everything, so...

82
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,037
that's why
it's a little inconsistent.

83
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:41,840
But we're not
gonna break. Right?

84
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:42,974
- No. Right.
- Yeah.

85
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:44,686
Okay, we're gonna keep our poise

86
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:46,279
- and we're gonna stay calm...
- Jesus Christ,

87
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:48,926
a meteor could hit
and you would say, "Stay calm."

88
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:50,420
Oh, fuck off, Bonnie.

89
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:51,570
- You know what? I'm so tired
- You fuck off.

90
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:52,390
Of taking care of you

91
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:53,698
- and your fucking feelings.
- Oh my...

92
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:54,985
- I know your mom had a stroke,
- God...

93
00:05:55,072 --> 00:05:56,007
but let's not forget,

94
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,176
- you're the one who pushed him.
- What the fuck you say to me?!

95
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:58,982
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- First off, he slipped.

96
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:00,085
Oh, my God.

97
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:01,793
- No one fucking pushed anybody.
- All right, all right.

98
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,927
- He slipped.
- Come on. Bonnie.

99
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:06,963
- He slipped, right? Right?
- He slipped. Right.

100
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,718
Right. Yeah.

101
00:06:08,806 --> 00:06:11,371
- All right, let's go, baby. Come on.
- It's all right.

102
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,982
Jesus.

103
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,982
And so I started to run at him.

104
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:21,257
And the closer I got to him...

105
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:24,873
the more I knew
what I had to do.

106
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:36,646
You're still here, huh?

107
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:39,927
Yeah, I, um,
left and came back.

108
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:43,287
Doctor's gonna be here shortly
with an update.

109
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:55,912
You ready?

110
00:06:59,996 --> 00:07:01,380
'Cause I'm not.

111
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:07,169
She's too damn young,
for God's sake.

112
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,419
You're gonna fight this.

113
00:07:19,757 --> 00:07:23,560
You hear me, baby?
You're gonna fight this.

114
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:43,435
What did you say?

115
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,349
Something in the vein
of "Fuck off."

116
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:50,162
I know it was rude.
I feel bad.

117
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:51,939
I just...

118
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,763
Why were you all out there?

119
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:57,785
This secret
last-minute meeting.

120
00:07:57,873 --> 00:08:02,787
Were you helping Celeste
prepare for her custody battle?

121
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:06,724
Um, no, we were just being there
for her, you know.

122
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,240
- Solidarity. Yeah.
- And at night?

123
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:12,167
And during all this solidarity,

124
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:15,138
is that when "fuck off"
came up, or...

125
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:17,709
Mm-hmm.

126
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:22,300
You know, the other day,

127
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:23,731
when you talked
about hating yourself,

128
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:25,568
there was honesty.
I mean...

129
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,413
It gave me hope.

130
00:08:27,638 --> 00:08:30,583
First time in a long time,
the air felt clear.

131
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:35,019
But right now, it seems like
the window is fogging up,

132
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:36,638
like you're hiding again.

133
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:41,878

134
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:53,693
- Mom?
- Hey.

135
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,029
It's cold.

136
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:58,474
Come here.

137
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:06,515
- You couldn't sleep?
- No.

138
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:13,648
He knows that
I am lying about something.

139
00:09:13,827 --> 00:09:15,044
We made a pact.

140
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:16,545
He's my husband.

141
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:19,351
It's fucking pact, Madeline.

142
00:09:19,468 --> 00:09:21,378
You don't tell anybody that!

143
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:22,587
I mean, you're the one that says

144
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:24,753
Ed's all about truth
and honesty.

145
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:26,591
- He is.
- Oh, great.

146
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:29,628
So, suppose he leads with that?
Are you kidding me?

147
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:32,414
Then, we're fucked,
and Celeste is fucked first.

148
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:33,702
She'll lose her kids.

149
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:38,312
You cannot tell him that.

150
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:45,336
Yeah...

151
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:47,670
Hey, Kristen. Uh, we have
a seafood watch question.

152

The mom with the penguin kid

153
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,154
You got it. Yeah.

154
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:56,963
So, you're not gonna return
my phone calls or my texts

155
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,332
'cause I talked to the police?

156
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:00,519
No, it has nothing to do
with the police.

157
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,808
I just can't do this right now.

158
00:10:07,882 --> 00:10:10,128
Hey, who wants
to touch something, uh, prickly.

159
00:10:10,215 --> 00:10:11,545
- Me!
- Okay.

160
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:13,839
She... she's just to my left.

161
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:16,378
I'm just kidding.
No, I'm kidding.

162
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:17,878
We have slimy kelp here.

163
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,470
I just want you to know
how sorry I am...

164
00:11:19,558 --> 00:11:20,940
that it's come to this.

165
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,175
But at the end of the day,
we are still family, you know?

166
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:27,949
We're not family, Mary Louise.

167
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,535
All rise.

168
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:38,675
- Be seated.
- Okay.

169
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:42,056
I have before me
the psychiatric reports,

170
00:11:42,144 --> 00:11:45,086
together with the finding
of the child psychologist.

171
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:47,479
I am not satisfied.

172
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:50,058
As I stated at the outset,

173
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:52,420
the court takes these matters
seriously.

174
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:54,853
As both a judge and a mother,

175
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:57,158
I'm ill-inclined
to remove these children

176
00:11:57,246 --> 00:11:58,878
from the only home
they've ever known.

177
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:01,451
That said, I do have concerns.

178
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:05,322
Both parties will be provided
copies of the reports today,

179
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,878
which I would like to enter
into evidence

180
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:08,420
by joint stipulation.

181
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:11,253
Given the underlying neutrality
of these recommendations,

182
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:13,285
I anticipate no objection.

183
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:15,764
All right.
We will proceed

184
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:19,261
with the evidentiary hearing
tomorrow. Mrs. Wright?

185
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:22,001
I wish to first hear from you.
You will take the stand

186
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,767
and entertain questions from me

187
00:12:23,855 --> 00:12:25,790
as well as
the petitioner's counsel.

188
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,040
Your Honor, I'd like to conduct
a direct first.

189
00:12:28,128 --> 00:12:29,987
Not necessary.
You can redirect after,

190
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:31,712
should you feel the need.

191
00:12:31,988 --> 00:12:35,420
Okay?
See you all back here tomorrow.

192
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:42,285
Hey. No, come on.
We expected this. Come on.

193
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,378
Come on.

194
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:48,837
Are the boys
gonna have to be here?

195
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:50,322
Not for tomorrow, no.

196
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:56,003
Celeste. There is the risk
she could get full custody.

197
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,420
I'm not settling.

198
00:12:57,621 --> 00:13:01,086
- I am not settling.
- Okay.

199
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:03,044
And don't try to handle me here.

200
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:06,722
- All right? Don't do that.
- Handle, no.

201
00:13:07,507 --> 00:13:09,503
Advise, yes.

202
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:13,918
Farber's goal will be
to make you look erratic.

203
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:15,361
I can protect you some,

204
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:17,675
you just can't look like
you need protection.

205
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:19,372
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

206
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:21,855
Yeah, of course.
I'm on my own.

207
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:24,180
- That's what you're saying.
- You are not on your own.

208
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:26,097
But we need to be careful.

209
00:13:27,382 --> 00:13:28,675
Get some rest.

210
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:35,768
There's nothing more we can do.

211
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,761
I'm afraid
we just have to watch and wait.

212
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,089
Do you have any questions?

213
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:48,816
- Can we kill her?
- Bonnie.

214
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:50,751
She doesn't want
to exist like this.

215
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,111
We can't kill her.

216
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,074
I know it's done.
Pain management, we give her...

217
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:57,096
- morphine.
- DR. CORTLAND That isn't...

218
00:13:57,183 --> 00:13:59,420
the kind of pain we manage.

219
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,832
Morphine is not indicated here.

220
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,503
You'd do it for a dog.

221
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,961
- Bonnie.
- What?

222
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:07,191
Enough.

223
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:14,511
Oh, it's a total nightmare.

224
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,003
What, the hearing
is open to the public?

225
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,792
No, Judge Marilyn Cipriani.

226
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:22,035
I wish I knew somebody
who knew somebody who knew her.

227
00:14:24,048 --> 00:14:27,308
I, uh, said goodbye to Amabella.

228
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:29,369
Oh, Juliette...

229
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:31,919
I kinda told
her that I might be coming back,

230
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:34,371
you know, to soften the goodbye.

231
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:37,214
That was such a good idea.
I know, it's...

232
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:40,579
Um, my... my lawyer said
I need to talk to you

233
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:42,869
- about the severance again.
- Oh, honey, I know...

234
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:46,158
We... we know we owe it.
But now, it's...

235
00:14:46,246 --> 00:14:49,572
It's in bankruptcy trustee's
hands.

236
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,712
So, first things first,
we need to find you a new job.

237
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,919
Right, you... you got
our letter of recommendation?

238
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:57,894
- Yeah, I did. Thank you.
- Yep, sure. Of course.

239
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:01,980
So, I guess
this is goodbye.

240
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:03,799
Uh-huh.

241
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:09,423
Let's not.
No, it's not goodbye here.

242
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:12,878
Because we will rise up,
and when we do,

243
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:14,777
we will hire you back.

244
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:16,894
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

245
00:15:18,155 --> 00:15:21,082
Oh, I couldn't have done
this without you, Juliette.

246
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:25,524
Whoo!

247
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,878
Yeah, baby!

248
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:29,605
Whoo!

249
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:31,628
Good job, buddy.

250
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:35,128
- Good job, high five. Whoo!
- Oh, my God!

251
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:38,432
That was so cool.
I love that.

252
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:40,795
Hey!

253
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:42,941
What are you
not doing in school?

254
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:44,245
You're not suspended again,
I hope.

255
00:15:44,332 --> 00:15:46,300
No, it's
a parent-teacher conference.

256
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,035
Oh, cool. Well, you... I saw you
catch that wave.

257
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:51,626
Looks like you got it down.
You don't need my help, huh?

258
00:15:51,714 --> 00:15:54,044
No, I still need
your help. I'm not that good.

259
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:55,436
She's been teaching me!

260
00:15:55,553 --> 00:15:57,003
Again.

261
00:15:57,238 --> 00:15:59,086
- Both of you guys are so good at this.
- Hey, baby.

262
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:01,923
Uh, do you wanna just build
a sandcastle for a minute?

263
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:04,211
- Give us a second to talk?
- Okay.

264
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,173
- Thank you.
- You guys wanna talk private.

265
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:08,044
Yeah, we do. Will you take
a board, too?

266
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,457
- All right.
- Thank you.

267
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,856
- Make sure you got a moat
- Hey, over here.

268
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:12,983
- To keep the people out.
- Your toys are over here.

269
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,847
- Hi.
- Hey.

270
00:16:19,222 --> 00:16:21,277
So, you're gonna
freeze me out forever?

271
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,769
It's gonna take me a long time
to let someone in again.

272
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:30,925
I'm not walking away.

273
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:33,511
Mom, check this out.

274
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:42,611
- Bonnie, I...
- Metal in the pocket.

275
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:44,790
Look, I... I wanna apologize
for the other day.

276
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,628
I was completely out of line.

277
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,743
It's fine. We're going through
a lot of stuff, you know.

278
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,017
No, everything your mom
is going through,

279
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:54,720
I had no right to speak to you
like that.

280
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:57,410
And I want you to know
if I can be helpful,

281
00:16:57,498 --> 00:17:00,675
which I... I don't know
how I could, but I want to be.

282
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:01,804
Thank you.

283
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:04,775
You okay?

284
00:17:05,707 --> 00:17:07,378
Yeah, I'm good. Like...

285
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:11,134
what you said, everyone's
going through stuff, and I...

286
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:14,782
- I'm no exception.
- It's getting to you, isn't it?

287
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:15,994
What?

288
00:17:17,674 --> 00:17:19,251
It's getting to you.

289
00:17:20,134 --> 00:17:22,913
Every. Time. Every time.
I know how you feel.

290
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,673
It's like that put us on a list.

291
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,665
Please raise your right hand.

292
00:17:28,227 --> 00:17:29,564
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

293
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:32,079
and nothing but truth,
so help you God?

294
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:35,095
- I do.
- Please be seated.

295
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:39,125
- Mr. Farber.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

296
00:17:41,131 --> 00:17:42,382
The whole truth...

297
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,345
and nothing but the truth.

298
00:17:45,782 --> 00:17:47,311
Do you have any questions

299
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,984
concerning the oath
you just took, Mrs. Wright?

300
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:50,753
- None.
- Excellent.

301
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:52,829
And first off, my sympathies.

302
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:55,071
Your husband died.

303
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,798
And now this.
That can't be easy.

304
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,726
In fact, it's not been easy
for a long time,

305
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:01,647
has it, Mrs. Wright?
You were in

306
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:03,665
an abusive relationship
with your husband.

307
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:07,142
- Yes.
- Physically abusive.

308
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,720
- Yes.
- Emotionally abusive.

309
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:12,392
- Yes.
- He hit you.

310
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:16,126
- Many times.
- Did you ever hit him?

311
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:20,503
I mean, sometimes,
I would fight back.

312
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:22,540
Did you ever hit him first?

313
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:27,493
It happened, but...

314
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,168
I mean, more typically,
he attacked me.

315
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:33,142
That must have been terrifying.

316
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:35,423
Was it ever thrilling?

317
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:38,532
Thrilling?

318
00:18:38,673 --> 00:18:40,794
Did the physical
violence ever lead to sex?

319
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:43,517
- Objection.
- Uh, overruled.

320
00:18:44,532 --> 00:18:46,632
Did the physical violence
ever occasion

321
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,368
you and your late husband
to have sex?

322
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:52,548
- Yes.
- Great sex?

323
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,585
You were aroused
by the violence.

324
00:18:56,673 --> 00:18:59,169
I was not aroused
by the violence.

325
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:00,837
You never said that?

326
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:02,878
That the incendiary exchanges
with your husband,

327
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:04,741
including the physical violence

328
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:06,657
led to gratifying
and passionate sex,

329
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:07,954
did you ever say that?

330
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:14,220
My relationship with my husband
was very complicated.

331
00:19:14,507 --> 00:19:17,548
Complicated. Was it sick?

332
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:21,001
- It was not healthy.
- Are you over your sickness?

333
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,128
- Objection.
- Sustained.

334
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,071
Did you miss the violence?

335
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,044
No, I do not.

336
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,503
I... I miss my husband...

337
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:34,665
but I don't miss
getting beat up. So...

338
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,251
So, he beat you up often?

339
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,845
He did.

340
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:42,402
Did you ever call the police?

341
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:46,673
- No.
- Never?

342
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:48,712
Did you ever tell anybody?

343
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,837
- No.
- You never told anybody

344
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:54,264
that your husband
was hurting you?

345
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:55,670
I told my therapist.

346
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:57,142
Are you healed now?

347
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,110
- Objection.
- Sustained.

348
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:10,759
Do you, uh, recognize this man?

349
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:22,336
- Yes.
- What's his name?

350
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:25,220
- I don't know.
- Oh, not even a first name?

351
00:20:25,618 --> 00:20:31,503
Um... Jeff. Uh, Joe. Joe.
It was Joe. I... I think.

352
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:34,220
Did you have
sexual relationships with Joe?

353
00:20:35,674 --> 00:20:37,253
Uh...

354
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:40,086
Um, I did...
I'd had a bit to drink.

355
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,169
So, approximately how long
after you met Joe

356
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:44,169
- did the two of you have sex?
- Objection.

357
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:45,741
Well, not long enough
to get his name.

358
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,670
- Objection.
- Counsel.

359
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:50,665
Did this also get violent?

360
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:54,204
It was physical.

361
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,319
And are you really over
your sickness?

362
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:59,298
- Objection.
- Sustained.

363
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,840
Do you recognize
this man?

364
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:14,150
Michael something.

365
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,459
Did you have sex
with Michael something?

366
00:21:16,547 --> 00:21:19,414
My social life is not...
I mean, this is...

367
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:21,110
Did you have sex
with Michael something?

368
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,197
Yes.

369
00:21:22,863 --> 00:21:24,405
And it also got physical?

370
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,820
Um...

371
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,586
If anything,
I was the aggressor.

372
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:34,382
Oh, so where did
this aggressive sex take place?

373
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,568
In a bathroom.

374
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:38,919
- A bathroom stall?
- Yes.

375
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,044
- A public bathroom stall?
- Yes.

376
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,961
How long after you met
Michael something

377
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:45,961
did you have aggressive sex
in a public bathroom stall?

378
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:48,420
- Objection.
- Sustained.

379
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:50,726
In the interest of time, just...

380
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,086
And...

381
00:21:57,122 --> 00:21:59,937
No, this... Please.

382
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:02,508
Did you have sexual relations
with all these men?

383
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:05,587
Listen, this... this has nothing
to do with my capacity

384
00:22:05,765 --> 00:22:07,927
to parent my children.
This...

385
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:10,177
Did you children ever meet
any of these men,

386
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:12,106
these sexual one-offs,
your boys ever meet 'em?

387
00:22:17,173 --> 00:22:21,131
- They... They met Joe.
- No others?

388
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,867
Um, no.

389
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,880
Did you ever bring
any of these men home

390
00:22:26,968 --> 00:22:28,384
when the boys were there?

391
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:31,187
No. Um...

392
00:22:33,382 --> 00:22:36,398
Well, once. Once, I did,
but, um...

393
00:22:36,632 --> 00:22:39,044
He was gone. He was gone
before they woke up, so...

394
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:41,357
Oh, so if Josh were
to tell his grandmother,

395
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,202
"The other night, I tried
to get into bed with Mommy,

396
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:45,256
but there was a stranger there,"
he'd be lying?

397
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,461
If he said, "I tried to wake
Mommy up, but I couldn't,

398
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:51,295
and the stranger told me
to go back to my room,"

399
00:22:51,382 --> 00:22:52,965
that would just be
his imagination?

400
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,044
Uh... I mean...

401
00:22:59,273 --> 00:23:01,961
sometimes I, um,
have trouble sleeping,

402
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,469
and so I take Ambien,
and that...

403
00:23:05,674 --> 00:23:07,420
Have you ever driven
while on Ambien

404
00:23:07,507 --> 00:23:09,452
and run off the side of a road?

405
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:12,984
Um...

406
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:19,546
Your Honor, um...

407
00:23:20,156 --> 00:23:21,753
- Your Honor.
- Answer to me, please.

408
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,378
- Answer to me.
- No, I would...

409
00:23:23,465 --> 00:23:25,878
- I would like to address the court.
- Go ahead.

410
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:27,840
Um, I have...

411
00:23:30,507 --> 00:23:34,732
I drove off the road once.
I've struggled.

412
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,640
I've had difficulty in the wake
of my husband's death,

413
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:40,420
and I've engaged in... in...

414
00:23:40,672 --> 00:23:45,265
In self-destructive behavior,
including, um...

415
00:23:47,965 --> 00:23:50,625
including sexual encounters
and...

416
00:23:50,757 --> 00:23:51,795
Celeste.

417
00:23:51,882 --> 00:23:54,169
Please, let me, I'm...

418
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,756
I'm not gonna look you
in the eye and say

419
00:23:56,844 --> 00:23:58,961
that I'm healed,
but I will say this:

420
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,882
I am in the process
of healing, and...

421
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,378
And through it all,
I've always been a good mother.

422
00:24:10,586 --> 00:24:13,295
I've always put
my children's interests first,

423
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:16,795
and I've always, always
kept them safe,

424
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,133
even when Perry... even when...

425
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:24,795
there was a monster
in the house.

426
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:27,757
Have you ever been violent
with your children, Mrs. Wright?

427
00:24:32,548 --> 00:24:35,969
I overreacted on two occasions.

428
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:40,426
You ever strike
your mother-in-law?

429
00:24:43,256 --> 00:24:44,877
I slapped her in the face.

430
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:47,090
Ever push your husband
down a flight of stairs?

431
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:49,044
No!

432
00:24:49,265 --> 00:24:51,169
And how dare you?

433
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:52,904
How dare you?

434
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,684
This is a computer simulation
of your husband's fatal fall.

435
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:01,116
- Objection. Relevance, not to mention 
- No, Your Honor.

436
00:25:01,204 --> 00:25:02,749
- unfair surprise.
- Your Honor can take a de bene.

437
00:25:02,837 --> 00:25:04,364
Okay, this is
off-the-charts prejudicial.

438
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:06,575
- How?
- This isn't a jury trial, counsel,

439
00:25:06,663 --> 00:25:08,881
I'll give you time to impeach
if you want.

440
00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:11,420
This is where
your husband would have landed

441
00:25:11,507 --> 00:25:13,311
from a natural fall.

442
00:25:13,772 --> 00:25:15,256
Now, this is where he did land.

443
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:21,340
Oh! This is...

444
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:23,766
Hmm.

445
00:25:25,298 --> 00:25:27,155
The physics say...

446
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:29,561
that for him
to have landed there,

447
00:25:29,968 --> 00:25:31,819
he must have been pushed.

448
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,913
So, I dare to ask...

449
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:39,968
- did you push him?
- No. I did not.

450
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:43,003
How did he fall?

451
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:45,712
He lost his balance
and he slipped.

452
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:49,917
He lost his balance
immediately after you found out

453
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:52,324
he'd been unfaithful
with another woman

454
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:54,086
who bore his child?

455
00:25:54,173 --> 00:25:55,919
- Your Honor, this is not relevant.
- Not relevant?

456
00:25:56,006 --> 00:25:57,845
She might commit a homicide,
but hey.

457
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:58,886
- We can...
- Objection.

458
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,614
All right,
the objection on relevance is sustained.

459
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:03,140
Thank you, Your Honor.

460
00:26:03,386 --> 00:26:05,215
I have no further questions.
Thank you.

461
00:26:08,924 --> 00:26:12,660
- Okay.
- Shit.

462
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:16,550
God, Katie, you couldn't have cut
any of that off?

463
00:26:16,637 --> 00:26:17,729
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh my God,

464
00:26:17,816 --> 00:26:19,339
she was having me followed.

465
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:21,509
She was having me followed.

466
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:22,587
- I know, I think so.
- Unbelievable.

467
00:26:22,674 --> 00:26:26,371
She had PIs on me. God.
This is just...

468
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:30,211
Okay, that was rougher
than we thought.

469
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:31,503
You think?

470
00:26:31,738 --> 00:26:32,875
Jesus Christ.

471
00:26:32,963 --> 00:26:35,447
I'll need to put you
back on the stand.

472
00:26:35,535 --> 00:26:37,470
- No...
- We need to rehabilitate you.

473
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:39,086
Deconstruct a lot
of what just happened.

474
00:26:39,173 --> 00:26:41,837
I don't think I can get
back in that chair again. I can't.

475
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,993
I'm sorry,
but I think you have to.

476
00:26:44,081 --> 00:26:47,081
You can't leave it like that.
You can't.

477
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:48,635
And you've been
through so much, honey,

478
00:26:48,722 --> 00:26:50,670
but you have to fight
for those boys.

479
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:52,300
You can't leave it like that.

480
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,863
I dare to ask,

481
00:26:54,423 --> 00:26:57,382
did you ever push your husband
down a flight of stairs?

482
00:26:57,836 --> 00:26:58,901
I did.

483
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:02,229
You have to fight
for them. They need you.

484
00:27:26,577 --> 00:27:29,527
Well, I must say
I was surprised to hear from you.

485
00:27:32,256 --> 00:27:35,847
I have no intention of doing
anything, okay?

486
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:38,316
Okay.

487
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:42,113
All right, part of me
does want to do something,

488
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:46,173
but I've already done it
just by entertaining the idea

489
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:50,970
even... for a few minutes,
I've done it.

490
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:53,519
Look, let me tell you
what my shrink told me.

491
00:27:55,115 --> 00:27:57,321
It's not
about inflicting payback

492
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,581
on your cheating spouse.

493
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:03,431
It's about getting a sense
that you didn't just take it.

494
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,044
You didn't just swallow
your pride

495
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:08,292
and resign yourself
to being some wimpy ass victim.

496
00:28:08,456 --> 00:28:10,097
But you are looking
for payback.

497
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:13,574
True. I'd like
both Joseph and Madeline to pay.

498
00:28:13,757 --> 00:28:15,925
But I'm also attracted to you.

499
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,595
I keep both a masturbation diary

500
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:25,159
- and a bucket list.
- Lower your...

501
00:28:25,386 --> 00:28:27,043
You made both.

502
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:29,489
It's not just about me
getting even.

503
00:28:29,632 --> 00:28:34,027
It's about me getting you.
I want you.

504
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,386
Don't overthink it.

505
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:44,675
We have sex.
We'll probably love it.

506
00:28:44,997 --> 00:28:47,542
If we don't, we move on.

507
00:28:48,628 --> 00:28:50,683
Of course, if we do love it,

508
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:53,964
we do it again.

509
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:56,587
And again.

510
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,220
Jesus.

Ed, I'm at a loss.

516
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,368
I just hope I can convince you
that I'm incapable

517
00:29:38,456 --> 00:29:42,402
of doing something...
that I already did.

518
00:29:43,498 --> 00:29:44,777
I just...

519
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:48,919
I hope I can earn back
your trust.

520
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:53,597
Madeleine, there's nothing
I want more than to trust you.

521
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:59,019
And that said,
I can't just wave a wand.

522
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,558
Neither can you.

523
00:30:21,215 --> 00:30:23,253
What are you doing?
You know she's a good mother.

524
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,795
You need to call this off.

525
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,461
Oh, I know...

526
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:31,324
I thought about doing
exactly that. I really did.

527
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,441
But then, I...

528
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:38,837
I considered the boys and I...
She's not well.

529
00:30:39,027 --> 00:30:40,611
Clearly, you can see that.

530
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:44,183
No, what I see is a woman
who's struggling. Who isn't?

531
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,894
Are you struggling, Jane?

532
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,368
With your conscience, perhaps?

533
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:56,545
Ziggy told me
you purchased a gun.

534
00:30:56,632 --> 00:30:58,980
Did you plan to use it
on my son?

535
00:30:59,548 --> 00:31:02,870
Did you move to Monterey
to hunt him down?

536
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:06,336
Actually, I came to Monterey
in search of a good man.

537
00:31:06,423 --> 00:31:08,545
A good man who happened
to have a bad night.

538
00:31:08,632 --> 00:31:10,128
Do you know...

539
00:31:10,215 --> 00:31:12,545
the difficulty that my son
is gonna have to face

540
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:16,559
being a product of rape
because of your fucking son?

541
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:18,545
He was not a good man!

542
00:31:18,632 --> 00:31:20,837
Yeah, maybe I would have
fucking shot him.

543
00:31:20,924 --> 00:31:22,795
I didn't get the fucking chance!

544
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:28,924
- Good night.
- Good night, babies.

545
00:32:18,847 --> 00:32:21,328
Sounds like somebody's
having a party.

546
00:32:22,882 --> 00:32:26,125
Uh, you guys go ahead and put
your mom's food on the counter.

547
00:32:26,242 --> 00:32:27,295
I'll tell her it's here.

548
00:32:27,382 --> 00:32:28,867

555
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:51,354
I was just

556
00:32:51,517 --> 00:32:53,435
cleaning out my closet, you know,

557
00:32:53,523 --> 00:32:55,945
and I found my wedding dress
in the back.

558
00:32:56,305 --> 00:32:58,545
Just kinda reminded me
of a certain time

559
00:32:58,632 --> 00:33:01,367
when I was a different person
and...

560
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,547
I was so sure
that I was gonna be...

561
00:33:05,924 --> 00:33:07,003
a great wife.

562
00:33:07,172 --> 00:33:09,146
Anyway, this is where
it gets stupid,

563
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:11,500
- so brace yourself for this part.
- Okay.

564
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:14,998
I put on the veil and then tried
to put on the dress,

565
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:17,465
but it doesn't fit... but we're
not talking about that...

566
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,404
Uh...

567
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:22,412
just so I could reconnect
to that person, and then...

568
00:33:22,844 --> 00:33:24,548
I put on this song 'cause...

569
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:29,086
'cause you picked this song
for our wedding

570
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,930
and it always makes me dance.

571
00:33:34,336 --> 00:33:36,203
So, that's, uh, pretty much it.

572
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:39,043
Now you're up to speed.

573
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:41,984
And I'm also out
of breath.

574
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:53,758
Well, like I said before,
you can't just wave a wand.

575
00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:59,586
But that was
pretty fucking close.

576
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:34,924

I want to go back
to yesterday,

601
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:33,902
when counsel asked you
about the other men.

602
00:36:34,506 --> 00:36:37,863
I have to admit, we were
all a bit thrown by it.

603
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:40,167
- I was thrown.
- Mm.

604
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:45,253
I mean, I'm clearly
still struggling.

605
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,545
Are you getting
professional help?

606
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:51,449
Yes. Yes, I am, and I've stopped
taking the Ambien.

607
00:36:51,597 --> 00:36:53,542
And the other?

608
00:36:54,152 --> 00:36:57,363
Are we dealing with some kind of
sexual addiction here?

609
00:36:57,581 --> 00:37:00,097
No, there's no sexual addiction.

610
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:03,656
Mrs. Wright, something seems
to be going on here.

611
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:05,316
These encounters...

612
00:37:06,382 --> 00:37:08,919
- Are you getting help for this?
- I will.

613
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,561
- You will?
- Yes.

614
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,371
Why haven't you?

615
00:37:13,423 --> 00:37:16,461
I think I've been too ashamed.

616
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:18,413
To tell your therapist, even?

617
00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:21,712
- Especially my therapist.
- Why is that?

618
00:37:21,996 --> 00:37:24,660
Because she's worked so hard
on me, and...

619
00:37:26,382 --> 00:37:28,295
I think I just...

620
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,394
I desperately wanted to see
myself through her eyes

621
00:37:31,488 --> 00:37:33,003
and see progress.

622
00:37:33,214 --> 00:37:35,579
It seems like risky behavior.

623
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,652
How am I trust
that this will stop?

624
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,906
Because it will stop.

625
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,589
It will. It has stopped.

626
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,214
All right,
I have to be honest here.

627
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,761
It gives me pause.

628
00:37:51,277 --> 00:37:54,420
I need you to explain to me,
as best you can,

629
00:37:54,644 --> 00:37:56,795
what you think is going on here.

630
00:37:57,097 --> 00:38:00,420
I wanted to be touched.
I wanted it...

631
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:04,128
I wanted it to be...
uncomplicated,

632
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:07,253
and I wanted to be in control,
so...

633
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,691
And as it was said yesterday,
um, the violence with Perry...

634
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:18,128
would sometimes lead to sex,
which would...

635
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:20,777
I mean, it's... it's just...

636
00:38:22,298 --> 00:38:24,386
It's confusing, so...

637
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:29,417
I think that's...
And it sickens me.

638
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,336
And so that's why I was engaging
with the others,

639
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:34,503
because I... these other men,
because I think I wanted

640
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:38,378
to... to be free of Perry,
and I want to push him out.

641
00:38:38,675 --> 00:38:41,566
- "Him" being your husband?
- Yes. Yes.

642
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:44,111
Were you maybe looking
to hurt yourself?

643
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,572
No, I really don't think
I was doing that.

644
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,957
I think I just wanted
to push him out.

645
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,113
Well,
I am all too familiar that...

646
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:57,003
many women stay
with their abusers.

647
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,757
- Mm-hm.
- Tell me why you stayed.

648
00:39:05,003 --> 00:39:07,035
Um, because...

649
00:39:12,006 --> 00:39:15,173
I loved him, and I thought...
And... but I...

650
00:39:16,644 --> 00:39:19,214
I just always thought
he would get better.

651
00:39:20,177 --> 00:39:22,144
- But he didn't.
- No, he didn't.

652
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:26,816
And when I was happy,
I stayed because I was happy,

653
00:39:26,904 --> 00:39:29,369
and when I was depressed,

654
00:39:29,457 --> 00:39:31,683
I stayed
because I was depressed.

655
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:35,212
I mean, either way,
I was afraid if I left him

656
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,211
of what he might do.
I was afraid how he would react.

657
00:39:38,298 --> 00:39:40,420
I was afraid of being alone.
I was...

658
00:39:40,613 --> 00:39:43,003
So I stayed.
I stayed to survive.

659
00:39:43,136 --> 00:39:45,511
I stayed for my boys.

660
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:52,652
Yeah. I'm good.

661
00:39:54,418 --> 00:39:55,753
Mr. Farber.

662
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,060
Thank you.

663
00:40:02,102 --> 00:40:03,832
I dare to ask...

664
00:40:10,514 --> 00:40:12,160
I'm right here, Mama.

665
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,183
Can you see me?

666
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:22,980
How you doing?

667
00:40:59,006 --> 00:41:00,964
Well, it looks like it's time.

668
00:41:03,006 --> 00:41:06,207
I have to confess something
that I'm not so proud of.

669
00:41:06,623 --> 00:41:08,339
And as I was writing...

670
00:41:10,256 --> 00:41:13,535
I realized I needed
to confess to you first.

671
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:18,464
So, here it goes.

672
00:41:21,715 --> 00:41:23,269
I resent you...

673
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,800
for the childhood I had.

674
00:41:26,269 --> 00:41:28,808
I resent you
for your impatience...

675
00:41:30,215 --> 00:41:32,253
for being scared
of doing my homework

676
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,980
without being yelled at...

677
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,621
for all the kitchen
cabinet doors you slammed...

678
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,355
for slapping me,

679
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,378
for all the bruises.

680
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,730
I resent you
for not feeling safe at home.

681
00:41:50,548 --> 00:41:53,183
I resent you
for being ashamed of me.

682
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,798
I resent you
for all the sex

683
00:41:58,886 --> 00:42:00,853
I started to have
when I was 13

684
00:42:00,941 --> 00:42:03,441
to prove to myself
that I could be loved.

685
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,003
I resent you for my wanting

686
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,855
to beat the shit
out of everyone.

687
00:42:14,674 --> 00:42:17,795
I resent you for making me feel
so fucking worthless

688
00:42:17,882 --> 00:42:20,457
that I settled for a man
that I don't...

689
00:42:27,538 --> 00:42:29,128
But mainly...

690
00:42:30,495 --> 00:42:32,199
I resent you...

691
00:42:33,882 --> 00:42:35,746
for killing a man.

692
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:42,097
I killed Celeste's husband,
and he didn't slip.

693
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,472
I pushed him.

694
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:49,871
I snapped, and...

695
00:42:50,425 --> 00:42:55,441
when I lunged at him,
I... I was pushing you.

696
00:43:00,058 --> 00:43:02,660
And that push
was a long time coming.

697
00:43:06,465 --> 00:43:08,433
And I wanna forgive you.

698
00:43:25,777 --> 00:43:29,142
There was an incident where
a little girl was being bullied,

699
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:33,363
bitten, choked.
The bully was your son.

700
00:43:35,507 --> 00:43:37,158
My sons are good boys.

701
00:43:37,246 --> 00:43:39,449
So, given your struggles,
why not let them stay

702
00:43:39,537 --> 00:43:41,939
with their grandmother
while you heal.

703
00:43:42,027 --> 00:43:45,667
I am their mother.
And they belong with me.

704
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:53,628
- Robert Johannsson.
- Yeah.

705
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,699
And this was for a model train?

706
00:43:55,863 --> 00:43:58,003
A Lionel Union Pacific Car.

707
00:43:58,207 --> 00:43:59,962
It's, uh, vintage.

708
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,564
Stated value is 2,200 dollars.

709
00:44:01,652 --> 00:44:03,461
It's probably worth
closer to 3,000.

710
00:44:03,548 --> 00:44:04,753
Duly noted.

711
00:44:05,746 --> 00:44:07,261
Marshall Brickman.

712
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:12,011
No Marshall Brickman?
All right, Juliette Dubois.

713
00:44:12,506 --> 00:44:13,960
I didn't know...

714
00:44:14,048 --> 00:44:17,464
And you're seeking severance
in the amount of 72,000 dollars?

715
00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:19,996
Yes, sir.
I worked there for six years.

716
00:44:20,143 --> 00:44:23,502
Okay. And what is
this "other" listed?

717
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:25,336
Hundred and sixty thousand
dollars?

718
00:44:25,511 --> 00:44:28,253
That's for other services
rendered,

719
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:30,970
for which I was promised
to be taken care of.

720
00:44:31,058 --> 00:44:33,548
Mm-hmm.
And what other services?

721
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,003
Uh, stress management.

722
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,044
Can you be more specific?

723
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,964
I just like to leave it at that
if I could.

724
00:44:47,298 --> 00:44:49,461
I still love you.
You know that, right?

725
00:44:49,548 --> 00:44:51,670
Shut the fuck up

726
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:56,712
for the rest
of your fucked-up fucking life.

727
00:44:56,799 --> 00:44:58,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:44:58,548 --> 00:45:02,336
I don't wanna hear
one fucking word

729
00:45:02,423 --> 00:45:07,169
from your fucked-up
little fucking twerp mouth

730
00:45:07,386 --> 00:45:12,837
on why you fucked up, no matter
what fucked-up excuse

731
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:14,253
you come up with.

732
00:45:14,363 --> 00:45:17,214
You fucking... fuck shit!

733
00:45:18,131 --> 00:45:19,461
Fucking!

734
00:45:19,548 --> 00:45:22,730
The fucking nanny?!

735
00:45:30,615 --> 00:45:32,324
All rise.

736
00:45:38,173 --> 00:45:39,378
Be seated.

737
00:45:41,058 --> 00:45:43,753
As I said,
I find the psychiatric reports

738
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,947
and the custody evals
a bit of a wash,

739
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:48,525
but I think I have
a pretty good grasp

740
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:50,222
of what we're dealing with here.

741
00:45:50,363 --> 00:45:53,324
And I'm prepared to enter
my finding at this time.

742
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,381
In the case...

743
00:45:56,298 --> 00:45:57,378
Mrs. Wright.

744
00:45:57,511 --> 00:45:59,371
I would like to call a witness.

745
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,829
I don't think
a character witness

746
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:05,398
- would carry much weight...
- This is not a character witness.

747
00:46:05,652 --> 00:46:06,931
You've been asked to decide

748
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:09,128
where my boys
would be better off.

749
00:46:09,215 --> 00:46:10,587
That puts in question

750
00:46:10,674 --> 00:46:13,086
the petitioner's fitness
as well.

751
00:46:13,173 --> 00:46:15,044
I was examined.
She should be too.

752
00:46:15,131 --> 00:46:16,378
There has been no suggestion

753
00:46:16,465 --> 00:46:18,461
that my client's
parental capacity

754
00:46:18,548 --> 00:46:21,211
- is up for review.
- I'm making that suggestion now.

755
00:46:21,394 --> 00:46:23,660
I was fair game. So is she.

756
00:46:24,423 --> 00:46:26,044
All right. We will schedule

757
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:28,829
the petitioner's testimony
for Tuesday.

758
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:30,378
And with the court's permission,

759
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:32,451
I would like
to question her myself.

760
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:34,919
I don't think that's wise.

761
00:46:35,006 --> 00:46:37,169
I'm an attorney. I have
a current bar license.

762
00:46:37,256 --> 00:46:39,957
I'm entitled to participate
in my own defense.

763
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,775
That may very well be true,

764
00:46:42,863 --> 00:46:44,626
but I don't think
it's in your best interest.

765
00:46:44,714 --> 00:46:46,086
It's my fight, Your Honor.

766
00:46:46,173 --> 00:46:48,425
I ask that you let me wage it.

767
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,169
Very well.

768
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:52,861
Tuesday at one o'clock.

769
00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:54,644
Until then, we're adjourned.

The Monterey Five,

800
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,433
whatever we call ourselves,

801
00:49:41,803 --> 00:49:43,094
the lie...

802
00:49:43,674 --> 00:49:45,027
is the friendship.

803
00:49:47,445 --> 00:49:49,845
I can just
see the damage that it's done.

804
00:49:50,131 --> 00:49:52,582
It's eroding every
single one of us.

805
00:49:52,818 --> 00:49:54,586
You were a part of this.

806
00:49:54,674 --> 00:49:57,222
Who knows
what I haven't seen?

807
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,285
You can't falter here.

808
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,382
Do you hear me?

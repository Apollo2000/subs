3
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,924
What's out there?

4
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,843
You scared me.

5
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,344
I'm gonna have to tie
a bell around your neck

6
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,680
so you don't keep sneaking up on me.

7
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,765
What do you look at in the ocean?

8
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,519
Oh, nothing.

9
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,938
You spend a lot of time
staring at nothing.

10
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,401
Okay, I take it back.

11
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:36,280
It's something. It's the big out there.

12
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,659
The ocean is powerful.

13
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:43,412
Mostly it's vast.

14
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:47,541
It's full of life, mystery.

15
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:51,295
Who knows what lies out there
beneath the surface?

16
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,505
Monsters?

17
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,757
Monsters? Maybe.

18
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,969
Dreams. Sunken treasure.

19
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,180
It's the great unknown.

20
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,099
That's what the ocean is.

21
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,979
I don't wanna go, Mom.

22
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,773
I know you don't, but you have to.

23
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,066
It's gonna be fine.

24
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,235
But they all think I choked that girl.

25
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,779
Yeah, but you know that you didn't
and I know that you didn't.

26
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,407
It's good enough for me; it
should be good enough for you.

27
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:23,035
It's gonna be good enough
for everyone else, too.

28
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,498
What's our mantra?

29
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,626
Every day we're gonna be...

30
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,127
- Brave.
- We're gonna be so brave.

31
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,087
Good job. Let's go.

32
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,549
- Mom, why did we move here?
- Ziggy.

33
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,473
Okay.

34
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,352
I don't have time for this this morning.

35
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,853
Please put your shirt on.

36
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,688
Why did we move here?

37
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,485
- Why?
- That's enough.

38
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,324
You can finish that in the car.
Let's go.

39
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,371
I don't mean to do your job,
but it begs the question...

40
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,872
is she running from something?

41
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,457
You cannot be serious, Joseph.

43

No. No.

45
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,006
This makes us look like cowards.

46
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,466
If you roll over on this,
it sets a precedent...

47
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,717
He basically laughed.

48
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,387
Do not yell at me.

49
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,682
You're the one... honey, can
you turn that down, please?

50
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,642
Do you understand the precedent
that you'd be setting?

51
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:31,228
Don't yell at me.

52
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,438
You know what?

53
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,733
I'm a lady and I've never said this
to anybody, ever, in my entire life,

54
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,985
but I'm gonna say it to you.

55
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,237
You can go fuck yourself on the head.

56
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,035
Right on the head?

57
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,829
I'm sorry, but he's trying
to shut down "Avenue Q."

58
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,539
He says it's too controversial.

59
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,582
Well, what's he want to replace it with?

60
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,334
Don't tell me "Cats."

63
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,347
You remember your first day of school?

64
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,266
I do, actually.

65
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:15,105
I got asked out on a date
by a second-grader, no less.

66
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,065
Did we accept?

67
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,777
He wore white Docksiders.

68
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,410
I'm sorry about last night.

69
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,122
The idea of a bully in the class...

70
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,875
I don't think he's a
bully, but you're probably right.

71
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,085
We should err on the side of safety.

72
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,130
Mm.

73
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,259
I wish I didn't have to fly out tonight.

74
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,432
I was thinking when you
get back from Vienna,

75
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,934
maybe we could see another counselor.

76
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,983
Yeah. I think it's a good idea.

77
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,821
This is gonna be a really
good year for us, Sparkles.

78
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:13,121
- We'll just go away forever.
- Why?

79
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,998
That's what the rule book says.

80
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,250
Oops.

81
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,044
Oh, wow.

82
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,921
Bit of a line here.

83
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,673
Oh, it'll move quickly.
We just drop and go.

84
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:27,010
- They've got it down to a science.
- Water, water, water.

85
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,179
- Oh, we don't go in?
- No, we just drop them off.

86
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,640
They can't be bothered
with the parents now.

87
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,892
What, so we don't get
to meet the teachers?

88
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,561
We did all that
yesterday at orientation.

89
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,730
No. They go right into class today.

90
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:41,233
Don't you? Hmm? Big boys.

91
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,276
Uh-huh. Whoa.

92
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,530
Well, that...

93
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,699
Max, look what the witch gives me.

94
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,159
Whoa!

95
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,702
That's not something
you could've mentioned?

96
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,039
We discussed it.

97
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,463
Hey!

98
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,048
School time.

99
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,631
You could've told me
that Orientation Day was...

100
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:14,767
Don't.

101
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,561
We may have assigned seats.

102
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,814
If not, you can plop down
right next to me.

103
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,774
Hi, Skye.

104
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,152
This is my friend, Ziggy.

105
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,947
- Hi.
- We're half-sisters, sort of.

106
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,574
My mom was married to her dad.

107
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,908
Hi, Chloe.

108
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,715
Hey, mama bear.

109
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,833
- Hi.
- I'm going to yoga class.

110
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:48,785
You wanna join me?

111
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,219
I would love to,
but I have a job interview.

112
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,471
Oh, wow.

113
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,931
Don't worry about him, honey.

114
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,766
He's gonna be fine.

115
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,852
I promise.

116
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,896
Get laid, bitch.

117
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,981
See you later.

118
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,154
Maybe it was
inappropriate, handing out invites

119
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,990
on the first day,
but Renata's a planner.

120
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,284
Renata was sending a message.

121
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,041
I was thinking you could do it.

122
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,001
I don't practice anymore. I can't.

123
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:26,213
I know, but you could come out
of retirement just this one time

124
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,673
so you can safeguard
all of the arts for Monterey.

125
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,842
Plus hear me out.
I would be your only client.

126
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:34,012
And how fun would that be
to have drinks with the client?

127
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,851
- Yoga is a time for quiet reflection.
- Uh, yeah. I know.

128
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,519
I don't like to be touched.

129
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,647
- Okay, breathe into it.
- Okay.

130
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,815
There you go.

131
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,652
- Back corner.
- Hmm?

132
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,989
- Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
- Shh!

133
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,866
Don't shush me.

134
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,660
Ugh, she has her own yoga studio.

135
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,161
- What's she even doing here?
- Shh!

136
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,914
Okay!

137
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,458
We do have a session where the
rules are more relaxed, you know?

138
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,627
Our perimenopausal class.

139
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:12,008
That won't be necessary.
I won't be coming back.

140
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,261
Okay, you will never believe
what she just said to me.

141
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,054
What? Here.

142
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,265
What? No, here.

143
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,641
You're so pretty when you're mad.

144
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,059
Please don't post that on Facebook.

145
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,477
- Ed will kill me.
- Hey, Maddie.

146
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,354
- Hey, Celeste.
- How amazing was that class?

147
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,522
- Hi, guys!
- Hi.

148
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,191
Nathan. Yoga, wow.

149
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,860
Yeah. Bonnie got me into it.

150
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,655
Yeah, well, you know, gotta
sweat out all those toxins.

151
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,156
We drank, like, a bottle
of wine last night.

152
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,118
And today I was like,
"We are going to yoga."

153
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,496
You know, I got Abby to sign up
for one of my piloxing classes.

154
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,873
That's... fantastic.

155
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,128
Oh, I'm gonna call again
about that petition thing.

156
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,838
- I mean, it's ridiculous.
- Oh, you don't need to worry about that.

157
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,506
But they should be able
to just take my name off.

158
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,467
- I mean...
- Nothing's gonna stop us, honey.

159
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,760
Ticking bomb.

160
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,220
I'll leave it at that.

161
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,722
Tick-tick-tick.

162
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,390
Could she put a shirt on?

163
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,059
Boom.

164
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,854
Our very first project

165
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:11,318
will be for each of you
to do a family tree,

166
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,404
where you get to talk
about your wonderful family.

167
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,864
Isn't that great?

168
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,825
But before that,
I am going to introduce you

169
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,537
to a very, very special
friend to our class.

170
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:25,290
This...

171
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,542
is Harry the Hippo.

172
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:32,547
Now, Harry here
has been a beloved member

173
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:38,178
of the first grade for almost 10 years!

174
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:42,057
Now, I know you're not
in kindergarten anymore,

175
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,394
and you're about to find out
that the transition

176
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,855
to first grade is not always easy.

177
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,400
But with Harry here,
you won't even notice it.

178
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,443
I promise.

179
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,362
And the best part...

180
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,365
you will all have your turn

181
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,659
to take Harry home for sleepovers.

182
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,789
Now I'm gonna start off our day

183
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:09,459
by passing Harry around so you
can all greet him with a hug.

184
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,586
Okay? Here you go, Billy.

185
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:13,880
Yes.

186
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,840
Does Harry want to be hugged?

187
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,509
Why, yes. Harry loves hugs.

188
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,096
I mean, look, let's face it.

189
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,680
Amabella picked that Ziggy
out of a lineup

190
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,099
and she was unwavering.

191
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,935
The kid was off. I'll leave it at that.

192
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,400
I thought your flight was at 5:00.

193
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,111
Well, traffic might be bad.

194
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,654
It's 11:30.

195
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,197
Thank you. Good to know.

196
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,913
Are you serious?

197
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,540
I changed my flight so I could be here

198
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,084
on their first day of school.

199
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,710
And then I don't even
get to go in the building.

200
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,254
I understand, but I just...

201
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,339
And for you to just dismiss
my being upset about it?

202
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,175
I didn't dismiss anything.

203
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,095
- I just don't want to be blamed...
- Yeah, you know what I think?

204
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,973
You didn't want me
to be there for orientation.

205
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:07,815
What?

206
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,979
You decided to have
that moment all to yourself.

207
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,398
Mommy and her boys.

208
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,275
You're such a child.

209
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,489
Oh!

210
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,911
I'm sorry.

211
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,746
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

212
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,582
- Don't. No.
- I'm sorry.

213
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,461
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, honey.

214
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,504
Fuck. Hey, hey...

215
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,257
Hey, hey, hey. Sorry.

216
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,968
It's just... fuck.

217
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,511
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,181
You know, all... it's just
all this traveling...

219
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,683
I feel like I'm missing out on so much.

220
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,518
They'll be grown one day, and I just...

221
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,857
Sorry. Sorry, sorry. I'm so sorry.

222
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,400
Huh?

223
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:03,323
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

224
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,782
I love you.

225
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,872
No, no, no, no.

226
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,760
There you go.

227
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,803
- Huh?
- Let me go.

228
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,394
Yeah.

229
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,439
Ah!

230
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,615
Yeah!

231
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,250
Oh, God!

232
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,961
Oh!

233
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,775
Perry and Celeste?

234
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,986
Honestly...

235
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,029
I'd sleep with either.

236
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,449
Call "The Wall Street Journal"

237
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,493
and tell them we make a deal
now with these guys,

238
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,371
or they're never gonna
have anybody by them.

239
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,039
No, this is ridiculous!

240
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,500
Juliette?

241
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,168
Because my
daughter's got to get picked up.

242
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,212
Sorry, I'm distra... yes.

243
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,256
You need to get in the car right now
and pick up... hold on one second.

244
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,382
I thought you were picking her up.

245
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,759
No, I'm doing an interview here!

246
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,678
Turns out it's actually harder

247
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,555
to have a part-time job
versus a full-time job

248
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,140
because in addition
to doing all that work,

249
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,017
you're out there
scouring for another job.

250
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,893
Are you looking for another job?

251
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,687
I only do 20 hours a week max.

252
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,440
Between you and I, I try to
maintain my full-time-mommy status

253
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:04,319
so I can lord it over women like
Renata and the other career mommies.

254
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,238
Oh, there they are!
Our future world leaders!

255
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,740
- Do you see mine?
- Yeah.

256
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,992
Chloe!

257
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,619
Ma'am, please?

258
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,287
What, I can't call for my own daughter?

259
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:17,206
Please reboard the vehicle, ma'am.

260
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,959
- You causing trouble, woman?
- Get in the car.

261
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,086
And don't ever blow
your whistle at me again.

262
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,339
You're new here. I'm not.

263
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,425
- Mommy!
- Hi, baby!

264
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,177
So, how was your first day?

265
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,721
Fine. We got to meet Harry the Hippo.

266
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,765
And, Zig?

267
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,391
- Good.
- Yeah?

268
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,185
- Teacher's nice.
- She is?

269
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,436
Oh, that's amazing.

270
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,021
That's so great.

271
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,439
What's that?

272
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,528
Oh, Amabella's having a party.
That's sweet.

273
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,948
I didn't get invited.

274
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,452
Honey, you don't know her very well.
You don't know her at all.

275
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,665
This is about that stupid accusation.

276
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,095
It's fine.

277
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,918
Was she the only one?

278
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,421
Okay, what are we listening to?

279
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,424
Feces is never terribly far
from Madeline's fan.

280
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,052
And the whole party thing
created a vortex.

281
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,804
Outrageous is what it is.

282
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,264
For the whole class to be invited
with the exception of Ziggy?

283
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,142
- I mean, come on.
- Oh, is he the kid who, uh...?

284
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,020
- Will you please?
- What?

285
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,897
Chloe.

286
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,732
Abby, come on.

287
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,317
This is so Renata.

288
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,695
On the very first day of school?

289
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,405
Well, if she's convinced that this Ziggy

290
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,031
poses a threat to her daughter's safety,

291
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,866
of course he's not gonna get invited.

292
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,786
I'm just saying that
distributing the invitations

293
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,205
in the classroom to the
exception of one person...

294
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,748
I mean, it's just unacceptable.

295
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,793
Thank you, honey. This looks delicious.

296
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,003
Abby, are you dating the fridge?

297
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:50,299
Mm, Chloe, I set up a standing playdate

298
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,218
with you and Ziggy on Thursdays.

299
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,971
Cool.

300
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,349
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- Why would it not be?

301
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,768
We don't know for a fact
that he's innocent.

302
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,646
Maybe the benefit of the doubt

303
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,315
should run in Chloe's favor
instead of Ziggy.

304
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,318
Are you suggesting I might be
putting my daughter in harm's way?

305
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,820
Oh, you mean our daughter?

306
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,240
Chloe, I don't know
why you didn't text me

307
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,908
or call me when the snub happened.

308
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,035
I might've been able to intervene.

309
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,787
How would she call you?

310
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,834
She has a phone in her doll.

311
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,211
Don't start with me right now.

312
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,714
It's just for emergencies.

313
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,508
You really shouldn't
encourage her to play with dolls.

314
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,927
And why is that, exactly?

315
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,264
It's a little 1960s,
not to mention sexist.

316
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,851
- Is it a Barbie doll?
- You can't put a phone in a Barbie, dummy.

317
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,728
Chloe!

318
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,813
Barbies aren't allowed anyways.

319
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:49,025
Sylvie Baker's gave
Joey Proccacini a boner.

320
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,611
Okay.

321
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,405
You know, Abigail, I am super impressed

322
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,240
with your emerging social conscience.

323
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,951
- I really am.
- Shall we leave it at that?

324
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,370
Or is now the time to pile on Bonnie?

325
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,395
I just have a very low
tolerance for injustice,

326
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,273
which is exactly what's going
on with Ziggy and his mom.

327
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:35,988
You fled the table when
Abby brought up Bonnie.

328
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,491
I'd ask what's the deal
with Bonnie, but...

329
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,494
I think we both know
it's really about Nathan.

330
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,412
- That is not true.
- Yeah, it is true.

331
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,332
Ed, I shouldn't have to
constantly run into the guy.

332
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,501
Monterey has 30,000 people,

333
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:52,004
and I can't go to a goddamn yoga
class without seeing him and her?

334
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,674
And yoga? Give me a break.

335
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,885
When I was married to him, he
wouldn't so much as go for a walk.

336
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,221
And when he finally did,
he never came back.

337
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:03,057
- Remember that big fight I promised?
- Yeah?

338
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,309
- I think now would be a good time.
- Why?

339
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,396
Is Nathan the one?

340
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,065
- What? What do you... what do you mean?
- The one.

341
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:14,026
For every person, there's the one.

342
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,696
Case in point, you're my one.

343
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,574
- Well, you are my...
- Shut up.

344
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:23,494
But for you, he's the one you
fell irreparably in love with,

345
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,454
who irreparably broke your heart,

346
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,249
who you apparently can't
get over 15 years later.

347
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,170
- Have you lost your mind?
- No, I'm never out of my mind.

348
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,172
I don't get to be crazy, Madeline.

349
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,050
I'm stable, I'm grounded.

350
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,595
Good ol' steady Eddie, that's me.

351
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,015
Wow.

352
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,350
Where is this coming from?

353
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:50,104
It's coming from the fact that you
don't really seem to adore me,

354
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,481
that you're rarely
interested in having sex,

355
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,903
but specifically today, it's coming
from your constant carrying on

356
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,239
about Nathan and his
seemingly perfect life,

357
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:03,409
which tells me that you are far
from satisfied with your own.

358
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,202
And I am fucking sick of it.

359
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:11,667
Look, I may not be the
good-looking adventure ride, okay?

360
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,837
But there is something
to be said for being there,

361
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,505
for being truthful,

362
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,176
for being somebody you can
steadfastly count on.

363
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,889
I will not be anybody's runner-up.

364
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,141
You need to hear that.

365
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,685
Scratch the surface
of any Jimmy Stewart...

366
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,521
Charlie Manson.

367
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,359
No!

368
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,120
You okay?

369
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,331
He's scared.

370
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,083
Scared?

371
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,794
What are you scared of?

372
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,088
No, I'm not.

373
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,547
He is.

374
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,841
Oh, he is.

375
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,936
How's Ziggy doing?

376
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,897
Good.

377
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,858
Do you think he was the one who
hurt Amabella the other day?

378
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,528
- No.
- He's really nice.

379
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,279
Could he come over?

380
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,826
- Yeah, maybe.
- Okay.

381
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,911
Just have to ask your dad.

382
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:37,878
Hey, wanna meet me at Side Door?

383
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,839
I need to swap out my family
for some vodka.

384
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,882
Is your nanny there?

385
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,885
- Yeah. She is, actually.
- Great, I'll see you then.

386
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:50,099
I think they both had
drinking problems. I do.

387
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,685
Well, I'm happy to let you post it,

388
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,603
but nobody really reads these flyers.

389
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,023
And if you wanna get work these
days, you need a website.

390
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,441
I know, it's just so expensive.

391
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,817
It's not as much as you think.

392
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,444
Madeline's husband Ed is in web design.

393
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,903
He could help you
put something together.

394
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,864
Maybe.

395
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:08,242
I already have an accountant,
but otherwise, I would...

396
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,535
It's all good.

397
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,079
No, I would. Do you have any clients?

398
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,373
Yeah, I have a few portables
still from Santa Cruz.

399
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,834
Okay. Can I ask what brought you here?

400
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,044
The schools are great,

401
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,587
to build a better life for her son.

402
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,339
- That's all you'll get.
- Whoa.

403
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:25,134
Yeah, Ziggy, I did come here
with dreams of a certain life.

404
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,635
You are right.

405
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,597
Hopefully a better one.

406
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:32,641
Mom.

407
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:36,145
The chocolate one?

408
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,938
Okay, but I'm eating some.

409
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,779
♪ There's a fire inside, even in you ♪

410
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:47,615
♪ We all got the fire,
we all know what to do... ♪

411
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:50,592
We are looking at the victim's
relationships with every parent

412
00:22:50,593 --> 00:22:52,620
who attended Trivia Night.

413
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,164
♪ Kill or be killed,
find a way to feed ♪

414
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,958
♪ You're gonna go hungry if you
don't know what you need... ♪

415
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,627
"Is Nathan the one?"

416
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,505
Ugh. Of course not!

417
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,091
That he doubts my love for him?

418
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:08,761
And Ed's not a neurotic
guy, so maybe it is me.

419
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:13,432
Maybe I'm just lousy at conveying
how much I... I don't know.

420
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:16,185
You once said that you two
don't have sex very often.

421
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,563
That's because I'm exhausted
all the time from school,

422
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,857
or the kids, or the play.

423
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,736
What was Nathan like in bed?

424
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,238
I don't want to talk about Nathan.

425
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,739
- Really?
- Yeah.

426
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,116
But we are talking about Nathan.

427
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,951
No, we were talking about Ed.

428
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,537
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

429
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,914
Is it possible that you had
a little more passion

430
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,457
for Nathan than you have for Ed?

431
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:41,836
And maybe he senses that.

432
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,754
Men can be a little more intuitive

433
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,632
than we give them credit for, you know?

434
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:49,510
Have you thought about
seeing a counselor?

435
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,470
Oh, my God, we don't need a counselor.

436
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,972
Couples fight.

437
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,349
You telling me you and Perry
don't ever fight?

438
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:57,393
No, we do.

439
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,019
Sometimes.

440
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,063
And then do you run off
to therapy afterward?

441
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,444
More often than not,
we... we end up having sex.

442
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,115
Really?

443
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,575
Yes.

444
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,785
It starts with anger.

445
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,872
I don't... it's complicated.

446
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,419
Sometimes I think that he likes to fight

447
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,421
because it leads to sex.

448
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,092
Sometimes I think I like it, too.

449
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,181
How often does this happen?

450
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,765
Happens...

451
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,726
enough.

452
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:41,937
I have to say, Celeste, that sounds

453
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,440
a little bit twisted.

454
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,525
- But kind of great.
- Yeah.

455
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,196
So, the sex that you have is like...

456
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,573
♪ Hello ♪

457
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,617
Hi, Celeste, Madeline!

458
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,160
- How are you?
- Hi, Renata.

459
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:57,745
I was over there with my girlfriends,

460
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:00,247
getting our drink on, and I saw you two.

461
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,708
- Do you have a second?
- Sure.

462
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,543
Did you know that they're thinking about

463
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,254
closing down the local V.A. hospital?

464
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:10,758
It means that vets are having to
drive all the way to Sacramento

465
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:14,595
for their services,
which is so upsetting.

466
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:18,057
I've really dedicated
a lot of my life to vets,

467
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,101
specifically PTSD, so I'm gonna hold

468
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,270
a little, you know,
fundraising dinner party

469
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,898
and help defray costs
and keep the facility open.

470
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:28,484
It would be so great
if you and Perry could come.

471
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,695
- Yeah, sure.
- And... and, um, you and Ed, of course.

472
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,697
It would be so nice.

473
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,658
You're such a kind person, Renata.

474
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,327
- Thank you.
- And, you know, it was very sweet of you

475
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,704
to invite Chloe to
Amabella's birthday party.

476
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,082
Of course! Of course.

477
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,667
However, it wasn't very sweet

478
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,877
to single out and exclude little Ziggy.

479
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,295
Really?

480
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,130
You think it would be okay
for little Amabella

481
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,507
to be strangled at her birthday party?

482
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,050
I don't think so.

483
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:56,178
If Ziggy doesn't go,
then Chloe's not going.

484
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,805
Okay, I don't... I don't think

485
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,348
this is the right time
to be... let's just...

486
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,557
- Thank you.
- And if Chloe's out,

487
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,101
then the entire brigade will follow.

488
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,687
- She's basically the pied piper.
- What?

489
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,192
I like you, Madeline.

490
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,111
And... and I actually admire you

491
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,406
for sticking up
for your unapologetic friend,

492
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,241
but if I can offer something

493
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:20,577
as objectively as I possibly can...

494
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,622
do not fuck with my daughter's birthday.

495
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,249
I was in that bar,

496
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:28,168
and I distinctly saw Madeline...

497
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,004
glance at a steak knife.

498
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,088
What a cunt.

499
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,423
Excuse me?

500
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,716
Why don't you get fucked?

501
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:34,842
Wow.

502
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,636
The war is on.

503
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,180
You know, this really
isn't fair to Chloe.

504
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,226
Excuse me?

505
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,313
Last year, Amabella had a
jumping castle and a magician.

506
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,356
This year only figures to be better.

507
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,983
Oh, please.

508
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:53,652
For you to summarily say she can't go,

509
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:57,781
then use her as a tool to
get other kids not to go...

510
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,158
I am not doing that.

511
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,577
You know, one minute
it's Nathan or Bonnie.

512
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,120
Now Renata, not to mention

513
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:05,331
the parking monitor,
the girls in the car.

514
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,666
I can't even keep track
of all the fights you start.

515
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,585
Somebody needs to invent an app.

516
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,962
Well, maybe you could have
my back in some of them.

517
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,840
What is it about this Jane?

518
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:18,052
What is she, a long-lost
sister or something?

519
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,429
- Just a cause in lieu of...
- In lieu of what?

520
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:21,972
In lieu of a life?

521
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:23,640
Is that what you were gonna say?

522
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,059
Jane's a single mom.

523
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,311
Do you need an app to put
two and two together?

524
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,271
When Abigail was a little baby,

525
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:32,649
Nathan was not around
and I was a single mom, Ed.

526
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,735
And I'm still angry about it.

527
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:38,447
It's not my love for Nathan
that lingers after 15 years,

528
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,115
it's my resentment.

529
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,035
There's a big difference.

530
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,124
Did you hear me?

531
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,794
Oh.

532
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,674
They arrived just after you left.

533
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,468
Double the price, I think,
for nighttime deliveries.

534
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:43,178
Wow.

535
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:54,273
On a less positive note,

536
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,692
I believe I failed you miserably.

537
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:16,462
I thought Harry was just a stupid
stuffed animal for babies.

538
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,838
He is.

539
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,799
- Mom?
- Mm-hmm.

540
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:23,510
- Can we sleep with you tonight?
- Again?

541
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,345
Mmm.

542
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,598
Mmm, well...

543
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:30,934
as long as Harry doesn't snore.

544
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,604
I've heard it's a problem,
a real problem with hippos.

545
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:37,483
- Daddy snores.
- Yes, Daddy does snore.

546
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,111
No, like this!

547
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:42,654
Like this.

548
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:46,992
No, like this.

549
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,912
I wish Daddy were here.

550
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:54,208
Oh... yeah, me, too.

551
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,086
But the four of us all together,

552
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,796
we're gonna be fine.

553
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,423
- Mmm.
- Hmm?

554
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,552
Oh, what happened?

555
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,472
Harry is missing a leg.

556
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,640
- It was Max.
- It was Josh.

557
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:12,184
- It was Max!
- It was Josh!

558
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:15,187
You know, that's really...
that's super sweet of you, Madeline.

559
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:18,440
And as much as I appreciate
that, I feel like, you know,

560
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,735
if... if this birthday party
is ruined because of him,

561
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,904
then it's only gonna
make things worse for him.

562
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,405
Sweetheart, everyone
just assumes around here

563
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,782
I'm the root cause of everything.

564
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,991
- Don't worry.
- Right.

565
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:29,618
I think I would prefer it

566
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,453
if you let Chloe
go to the birthday party.

567
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,455
- Let me call you right back.
- But I...

568
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,666
Chloe, get in the car.

569
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:40,212
Chloe, get in the car right now.

570
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:41,630
What?

571
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,173
I need to talk to you.

572
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,803
Now.

573
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,021
I'm not having sex, I promise you.

574
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,125
What are those pills?

575
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,377
They're just for in case,
you know, the day comes.

576
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:04,069
Not that it's coming any time
soon, but I just have them.

577
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,029
You are 16 years old.
Where did you get them?

578
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,657
- From a doctor.
- Dr. Ennis?

579
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,701
She wrote you a prescription
without calling me?

580
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,786
Not her. I went to Planned Parenthood.

581
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,913
Please don't make a big deal about this.

582
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:16,790
I'm not sexually active, okay?

583
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,417
Who took you there?

584
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,460
- What?
- Planned Parenthood.

585
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,588
Did you take a car, an Uber?
Did somebody give you a ride?

586
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,340
It's in Seaside. How did you get there?

587
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,724
Here you are.

588
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,392
- Love you, Mama.
- Love you.

589
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:37,019
Bye.

590
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,478
- Stay in the car.
- Ma'am!

591
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,480
I'm just gonna be a minute.

592
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:43,108
Bonnie? Bonnie, can I talk
to you for just a second?

593
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:45,068
- Of course.
- A couple of things.

594
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:47,529
First of all, I'm happy that Abigail
has bonded with your mother.

595
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,907
Thrilled about the communal
potato peeling thing.

596
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,785
But when it comes to my daughter's
social recreational life,

597
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,370
particularly as it concerns medications

598
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,498
that will permanently affect
her reproductive organs,

599
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,626
will you just kick that little
can of worms over to me?

600
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,169
- Do you understand?
- I do.

601
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,504
And should Skye come to me
10 years down the road

602
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,632
and ask for a little lift
to Planned Parenthood,

603
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:09,009
I would give you
that courtesy call first.

604
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,260
Thanks.

605
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:15,015
- Ma'am!
- I'm dropping off my kid!

606
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,434
Come on, Chloe.

607
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,186
...don't give my daughter...

608
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,979
That's my daughter.

609
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,564
Next time you wanna do something...

610
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,858
why don't I take your daughter?

611
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:26,443
Your daughter?

612
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:28,570
Do whatever you want to her.

613
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,822
Fucking kidding me?

614
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,658
And what I don't understand

615
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,951
is why my own daughter
wouldn't come to me first.

616
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:37,245
I couldn't talk to my
mom about birth control.

617
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,497
Really?

618
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,749
If I were you, I would just let it go.

619
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:43,418
I would, with Bonnie, Abigail.
I'd ride it out.

620
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,711
No, I love my grudges.

621
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,171
I tend to them like little pets.

622
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:48,048
All right. I'm just saying.

623
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:50,676
I do the same thing.
I'm not into forgiveness either.

624
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,969
Really? Who do you not forgive?

625
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,971
No one. Just in general, you know?

626
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,391
Never forgive, never forget.

627
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,185
That sure sounds
like a motto to live by.

628
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:01,812
- Good morning, Maddie.
- Hi, Tom.

629
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,689
- How are you?
- Everyone's making me angry.

630
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,774
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Except for you.

631
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,776
- And me.
- And you guys.

632
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,695
Oh... Marv Herman.

633
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,488
He runs the muffler shop on Kentner,

634
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:14,157
and I hear that he's in need
of some bookkeeping assistance.

635
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,575
Great. Thank you.

636
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,536
And, actually, maybe
some legal assistance, too,

637
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,871
- if the zoning board stays on him.
- I'm retired.

638
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:21,443
Unless you're defending
the First Amendment.

639
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:22,542
You never give up.

640
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:25,043
Oh, I heard about this. Ridiculous.

641
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,712
- I mean, I can't.
- It is ridiculous.

642
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,797
It's obscene.
What can I get you, Maddie?

643
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,924
Oh, I'll have a cappuccino. And a shot.

644
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,552
I'm sure you have one back there.

645
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,887
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

646
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,723
Yeah, I guess... I guess
Shakespeare got it wrong.

647
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,766
"The play's the thing"
unless it has puppets.

648
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,477
Exactly! See, he understands me.

649
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,896
Unfortunately, gay.

650
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,022
- Really?
- Mm.

651
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,482
- Come on.
- Yes!

652
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,651
- You're sure of that?
- All the best ones are.

653
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,201
- Hey.
- Hey, Ed.

654
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,912
- What's up?
- Hey.

655
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,664
Love the look, especially the mirror.

656
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,375
It's... you got to respect
a man who has his own back.

657
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:09,045
Oh. Well, standard stuff.

658
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,672
Yeah. How's the computer business going?

659
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,090
Oh, great.

660
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,342
Kind of like landscaping, I guess.

661
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,719
Growth business.

662
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:19,931
That's... that's clever.

663
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,892
Um, hey, thanks for meeting me.

664
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,935
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

665
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,479
I just want to discuss this whole thing

666
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:29,149
with, like... that happened
with Bonnie and Abby.

667
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:30,233
Sure.

668
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,735
You know, as far as I can tell,

669
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,488
there was no undue
influence or interference.

670
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,031
Like, Abby asked Bonnie some questions

671
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,824
about Planned Parenthood,
Bonnie answered them.

672
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,494
Abby then asked Bonnie
to drive her there.

673
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:44,664
There was no parental usurps of
any kind, I promise you that.

674
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,708
But I can discuss that
whole thing with Maddie.

675
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,461
What I wanted to take up with you is...

676
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,379
I think you can probably appreciate

677
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,758
that it's a bit of a delicate
balancing act with my ex.

678
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:59,971
So... and, you know, I kind of
expect her to be rough on me,

679
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:03,558
but I think it's... like,
you can't punish Bonnie.

680
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,478
Well, I believe
she's being nice to Bonnie,

681
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:09,689
or at least trying
under the circumstances.

682
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,068
What circumstances would those be?

683
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,444
Nathan, come on.

684
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,863
It was pretty tough when you left.

685
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,700
But that was 15 years ago.

686
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:23,578
Okay, it's difficult for Madeline

687
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,207
to see you at every school
function so involved

688
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:29,960
when you weren't there for Abigail.

689
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:33,713
It's difficult to run into you
at yoga when you never...

690
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,423
You know what? Maybe I'm
talking out of turn here.

691
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,718
No, I was young, you know?

692
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:41,388
Maybe a bit of a shit.

693
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:44,641
But I made some real mistakes
with both Maddie and Abby,

694
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:47,394
but should I be required to make the
same mistakes with Bonnie and Skye?

695
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:50,564
No, but, you know,
doesn't hurt to be mindful

696
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,357
of other people's feelings sometimes.

697
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:55,443
Oh, yeah, yeah. Mr. Sensitive.

698
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,859
Excuse me?

699
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,828
No, actually, I meant that as a compliment.

700
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,535
You're kind of like today's
standard-bearer for the evolved man.

701
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:05,412
- Like, you work at home, you...
- Uh-huh.

702
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,706
You do almost 50-50 in the childcare.
You even cook.

703
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,792
Right, so you're the guy
who likes to fish and hunt,

704
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,419
and I'm Mr. Girly-Man?

705
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,296
- That's not what I meant at all, man.
- Okay.

706
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,089
I thought it'd be indelicate
to bring it up with Maddie.

707
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,758
That's why I'm bringing it up with you.

708
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,677
Well, that sounded
like a threat, Nathan.

709
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,137
Are you threatening me?

710
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,763
No, but, actually, I feel like

711
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,223
you're starting to threaten me,

712
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,350
which I don't think
you want to go there.

713
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,523
You know, this thing
with that Ziggy kid,

714
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:34,983
all the talk of bullying?

715
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:39,362
I was bullied. Sixth grade.

716
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:42,657
And I always turned the other cheek,

717
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,827
thinking that was
the more mature thing to do.

718
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,625
Some 30 years later, it still haunts me

719
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:55,587
that I didn't beat
the shit out of that kid.

720
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:58,256
So much so, I find myself fantasizing

721
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,426
that somebody will come along one day

722
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,846
and say or do something to me

723
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,557
that'll offer me the chance
to redeem myself.

724
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,939
You've always treated me
quite well, Nathan.

725
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,148
It's too bad.

726
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,363
Too bad.

727
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,578
What?

728
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:31,456
The first thing I said,
the very first thing I said...

729
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,832
"It wasn't just the mothers."

730
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,919
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass

731
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:37,379
if you fucking talk to me
like that again,

732
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,922
you fucking little shit.

733
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:41,091
Ed and Nathan hated each other's guts.

734
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,884
Aren't we all afraid to say that?

735
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:45,053
There's clearly a lot of bad
blood in this community.

736
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,065
What did he say?

737
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:59,859
The mayor refuses to authorize
funding for the production.

738
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,319
Which should be a legal matter,

739
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:02,988
and we could make it a legal matter.

740
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,823
The funding is discretionary.

741
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,700
- He could deny it on whatever grounds...
- Is he denying it?

742
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:09,369
He's suggesting we pick something
more community-centric.

743
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:12,080
Joseph, we have worked so hard for this,

744
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:15,250
and we are being victimized
by the small-mindedness

745
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,460
led by the likes of Renata Klein.

746
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:20,088
Understood, but we need to pick
our battles, and this is just...

747
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:23,299
And sometimes our battles pick us.

748
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:26,094
We can't quit. We just can't.

749
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:30,682
Is this about the play or winning?

750
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,311
I don't know. Maybe it's
a little bit about both.

751
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:38,523
But I get sick and tired of the
morally superior in this town

752
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,525
stepping all over everybody else.

753
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:43,278
And you said you wanted to be brave
with your artistic direction.

754
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,280
That's all I'm asking...

755
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,449
just... just be brave.

756
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,120
You told me to go
fuck myself on the head.

757
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:55,915
I just get...

758
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,793
You know how I get.

759
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:04,132
Please. This is important to me.

760
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:07,594
I'll talk to the mayor.

761
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,137
Thank you.

762
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,930
You're not gonna regret it.

763
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,182
You're not.

764
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:16,394
- What's this?
- "Frozen."

765
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:18,021
Taking my wife and my little niece.

766
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,735
Amabella passed out her
invitations on Wednesday morning.

767
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:25,447
Madeline was on the phone

768
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:28,364
inviting the kids to Disney on Ice
by Thursday noon.

769
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,867
The two events were scheduled
for the same day, same time.

770
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,744
A vicious shot over the bow.

771
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:35,830
Yeah. It's ridiculous.

772
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,418
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

773
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,836
I don't know what's wrong
with this woman.

774
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,088
It's like she's power hungry.

775
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,672
She can't just let us all get along...

776
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,508
I said thank you-uuu!

Hello?

785
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,647
Sexual assault?

786
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:45,650
It appears Ziggy kissed Amabella,

787
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:48,069
and the advance was unwelcome

788
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,822
and a little aggressive.

789
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:53,658
Ziggy kissed Amabella.

790
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,705
Ziggy kissed...

791
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,331
Amabella.

792
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:02,959
In addition to the murder investigation,

793
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:05,211
we are investigating others on assault

794
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:07,922
and conspiracy to incite violence.

795
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,842
The intent, by all accounts,

796
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,886
was to simply make peace with Amabella.

797
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,597
Which is an admission
that he did try to choke her.

798
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,557
No, just hold... hold on.

799
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:20,852
Zigfield still maintains his innocence
on the whole choking front.

800
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:25,148
The idea of brandishing affection upon
Amabella was first proffered by Chloe

801
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:27,150
in an attempt to ameliorate the
whole birthday party brouhaha.

802
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:28,776
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

803
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,069
Are you saying Chloe had
something to do with this?

804
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,738
- Uh, yes.
- Yes. Mrs. Klein.

805
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:37,702
She played a song, she invited
Zigfield and Amabella to dance,

806
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:41,122
and it seems your daughter has inherited

807
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,957
the "let's solve everyone
else's problems" gene.

808
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,627
The motion was then seconded by Skye.

809
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,545
I don't believe that my
daughter would ever sanction

810
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:48,838
a non-consensual touching.

811
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:50,715
She's a very peaceful child.

812
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:53,134
Isn't this just a whole lot
of brouhaha about nothing?

813
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,677
- Okay, look, we have a policy, sir...
- It's not nothing.

814
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,137
...and we'll get to the bottom of it.

815
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,347
- You have a policy?
- Yes.

816
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,556
Well, isn't that great news?

817
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,807
Why don't you follow your policy

818
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,226
or I'm getting an attorney.

819
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,518
Okay, we're not there yet, Mrs. Klein.

820
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,229
- I'm there.
- God, attorneys?

821
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,730
- Really? Is that necessary?
- Thank you.

822
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,232
Actually, in my graduate thesis

823
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,234
I coined the term "helicopter parent."

824
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11,694
But these gems, they're...

825
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,279
they're fucking kamikazes.

826
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:14,656
And I'm not kidding.

827
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,324
No one takes responsibility
for anything.

828
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:17,951
And Chloe's involved.

829
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,953
Not to mention
their health and well-being.

830
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,497
I mean, if I had a dime for every boy

831
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,749
that I tried to kiss
when I was six years old...

832
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:25,917
I mean, I can't even tell you.

833
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,293
There were so many.

834
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:29,170
They're children, for Christ's sakes.

835
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:32,173
They're supposed to be doing
things like kissing each other.

836
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:36,719
Jane?

837
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:41,266
What's wrong, honey?

838
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,809
You okay?

839
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,354
I'm sorry, I just...

840
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,150
Honey. It's okay.

841
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,652
They're just kids.

842
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,045
How can you not wanna make
up on this song? Come on.

843
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:14,966
Make up, yes, not make out, silly.

844
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:17,719
It's what you guys do when
you get mad at each other.

845
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:21,014
Big hug, kiss, bang,
and everything's better again.

846
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,016
But it's different with married people.

847
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:25,059
- Why?
- I don't know.

848
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,728
It just is. Don't start with me.

00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,225
- Hey, Sparkles.
- I thought it was, like, midnight there.

857
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,561
Yeah, I can't sleep.

858
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:10,396
Jet lag.

859
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,773
Right.

860
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,861
Is that the bathrobe I bought you?

861
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:20,656
Mm-hmm. It is.

862
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,451
Thank you for the flowers.
They're beautiful.

863
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:30,124
I miss you.

864
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,001
Yeah. I miss you, too.

865
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:36,297
And the boys miss you.

866
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,091
So, how was their second day?

867
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:41,969
It was fine.

868
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:49,936
Hey, will you do me a favor?

869
00:44:55,266 --> 00:44:56,538
What?

870
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:59,258
Take that beautiful robe off for a second.

871
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:04,992
The boys are waiting for me downstairs.

872
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:08,371
Yeah, well, I have to
help myself go to sleep.

873
00:45:08,415 --> 00:45:11,165
You need to help me help myself.

874
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,500
Do I, now?

875
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:17,296
Let me just look at my
gorgeous wife for a second.

876
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,299
Ten seconds.

877
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:24,262
I'll give you five.

878
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,389
Wow, make it a nice five.

879
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:50,163
Okay, that's enough, naughty boy.

880
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,250
You'll have to come home
sooner if you want more.

881
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:58,671
Come closer.

882
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,597
I love you.

883
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:15,062
Take her out of school
if you're that concerned.

884
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,982
She's the one that has to leave?
She didn't do anything.

885
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:20,359
I just don't think
legal action is the answer,

886
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:22,612
all right?

887
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,323
Let's see how it goes. I'm guessing
it'll all sort itself out.

888
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:26,908
I do not feel supported here.

889
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:30,161
Well...

890
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:32,580
I don't suppose I could
argue with your feelings.

891
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:49,472
Ziggy, why are you awake?

892
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:51,432
You're supposed to be asleep.

893
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:55,144
What's going on?

894
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:57,313
I saw you crying at school today.

895
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,193
I was just stressed out.

896
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:04,445
I'm sorry you had to see that.

897
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:08,783
At pick-up I heard
one of the mothers say

898
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,618
I was a little monster.

899
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:13,496
What?

900
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,498
Baby, you're not a monster.

901
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,459
You are not a monster.

902
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,797
Ziggy there's nothing wrong with you.

903
00:47:25,552 --> 00:47:27,134
Okay?

904
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:34,433
I love you so much.

905
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:56,664
Pickles and mustard.

906
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:59,500
I'm not pregnant.

907
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:02,753
You know, if that day ever comes,

908
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,089
the one you alluded to earlier...

909
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,842
Hmm. The day I decide to have sex?

910
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,844
That day?

911
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,179
Yes, that one.

912
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,181
Can we talk about it first?

913
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:17,852
Sure.

914
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,563
'Cause I actually think

915
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:22,064
I could be helpful.

916
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:25,276
Okay.

917
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,778
I have a lot of
girlfriends, as you know,

918
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:30,072
and never has any one of
them ever said to me,

919
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,908
"Gee, if only I had
had sex sooner in life."

920
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:35,202
Mm-hmm. This is awkward now.

921
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:41,542
Right.

922
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,800
So, Nathan said that you
threatened to beat him up.

923
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,302
Oh.

924
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:52,845
Of course not.

925
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:59,143
He wanted me to get you to
back off Bonnie a little bit,

926
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:01,103
it led to a discussion, and...

927
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:04,023
I never threatened to beat him up.

928
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:06,942
I did let him know I wouldn't
be intimidated by him,

929
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:10,237
which I think was his intent.

930
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:12,990
So, how did you two leave it?

931
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,159
We left it...

932
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:18,204
he's got Bonnie's back
and I've got yours.

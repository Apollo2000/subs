We should go home now.

00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:11,793
What should we make?

28
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,029
Uh, pizza.

29
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:17,099
No, not pizza again.

Amabella: She's not coming?

32
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:27,475
Well, she really wants to, sweetheart.

33
00:02:28,712 --> 00:02:31,679
Turns out she has a conflict.

34
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:35,550
It so happens that your party

35
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:39,387
is on the same exact day
as Disney on Ice.

36
00:02:41,357 --> 00:02:45,794
But if Chloe doesn't come,
is everybody else coming?

37
00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:47,962
Almost everybody.

38
00:02:47,964 --> 00:02:49,397
There are a few others

39
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:52,133
who are going to the other thing.

40
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:53,635
How many?

41
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:55,236
I'm not exactly sure.

42
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:57,238
How many, about?

43
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,206
I think six.

44
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,175
(sighs)

45
00:03:01,177 --> 00:03:05,746
Honey, but everybody else
in the whole class is coming.

46
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:07,548
It's gonna be an incredible party.

47
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,051
Come, come.

48
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:11,452
Oof.

49
00:03:11,454 --> 00:03:15,456
Hey, it's a beautiful weekend.

50
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,326
Look, they're setting up games.

51
00:03:18,328 --> 00:03:20,094
There's gonna be a bouncy,

52
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:23,897
a magician, princesses,

53
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:26,067
<i>Spider-Man for the boys.</i>

54
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:28,702
It's gonna be the best
birthday party ever.

55
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:32,305
Of course it's gonna be
the best birthday party ever!

56
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:33,673
Get over here, you little punk!

57
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:35,976
What are you doing, huh? Mwah!

58
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:37,844
Do me a favor, get your
swimsuit on, all right?

59
00:03:37,846 --> 00:03:39,412
I'll meet you in the pool, five minutes.

60
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:40,746
Ready? Go, go, go.

61
00:03:40,748 --> 00:03:42,315
Four minutes! Three minutes!

62
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:45,418
<i>(door opens, closes)</i>

63
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,853
What's going on?

64
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:48,955
Six kids aren't coming tomorrow.

65
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:51,157
Six.

66
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:53,759
It was a mistake to not
invite Ziggy Chapman.

67
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:57,097
Yeah, I kind of felt bad
about accepting those tickets,

68
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:59,132
but they're so expensive.

69
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:02,168
And plus Lily didn't know
Amabella from a tree trunk.

70
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,571
Honey, he tried to choke her.

71
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:06,939
She's afraid of him.

72
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:08,674
How could we possibly invite him?

73
00:04:08,676 --> 00:04:12,545
Yeah, but with Chloe
Mackenzie not coming and...

74
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,049
That fucking Madeline!

75
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:20,052
Honey, it's gonna be
a spectacular party.

76
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:23,923
Amabella is gonna have
the time of her life.

77
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:26,592
I'm gonna kill her.

78
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:35,568
Hey, are we going to some kid's
birthday party tomorrow?

79
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,569
- Celeste: Oh.
- Ran into Reed Whittaker today

80
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:38,970
and he seemed to think we were.

81
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:41,272
For about 10 seconds, but then Madeline

82
00:04:41,274 --> 00:04:45,276
got tickets to Disney on Ice.

83
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:47,412
Truly. (chuckles)

84
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:50,549
The kids are excited, actually.

85
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:52,717
Okay.

86
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:55,153
And what, I'm not invited
to this Disney thing?

87
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:57,388
(chuckles)

88
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,857
Come on.

89
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:01,325
You don't want to go to that.
You hate those things.

90
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:03,194
You don't think I wanna
spend some time with my family

91
00:05:03,196 --> 00:05:04,829
after being gone all week?

92
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:08,700
Why didn't we discuss this?

93
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,204
- No, let's not...
- Wh... no.

94
00:05:13,206 --> 00:05:15,406
Why didn't we discuss it?

95
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:18,609
Well, it just... it wasn't like that.

96
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:21,179
I don't know.

97
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:23,814
Madeline got the tickets and...

98
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:25,349
and there were only so many.

99
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:27,351
So it's a money thing.
We couldn't afford a ticket.

100
00:05:27,353 --> 00:05:29,987
No, it's not that. It's...
take my ticket, really.

101
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:32,190
- That's not the point.
- What is the point?

102
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:33,991
The point is that
one second they're going

103
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:36,060
to some kid's birthday party
that I didn't know about,

104
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:37,828
the next, you decided
to take them to a show.

105
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,797
- Come on, Perry.
- Am I not a member of this family?

106
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,566
Sometimes I have to make decisions
when you're 10,000 miles away.

107
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:43,201
You don't think it'd be
nice for Josh and Max

108
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:45,235
to spend time with their dad
who's been gone all week?

109
00:05:45,237 --> 00:05:46,770
All right. It... (sighs)

110
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:48,306
Do you think I wanna be
away all the time?

111
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:49,336
No.

112
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:50,781
Do you think I enjoy missing our family?

113
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:52,410
No.

114
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:54,812
Look at me, then. Look at me.

115
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:56,880
Come on.

116
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:59,249
- Huh?
- Ow, you're hurting me.

117
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:01,685
- Oh, I'm hurting you, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

118
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:04,387
- Can we talk about how much you hurt me?
- (whimpers)

119
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:07,324
Do you deliberately plan these things

120
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,392
to avoid having to be with me?

121
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:13,998
- Huh?
- Take your hand off me.

122
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:18,401
You could've bought another ticket.

123
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,904
(sighs)

124
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:29,513
I will leave you.

125
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,385
You touch me like that again,
and I will fucking leave you!

126
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:49,266
(crying)

127
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:52,202
Quinlan: <i>The injuries were many</i>

128
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,536
and they were severe.

129
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,738
We are talking multiple broken bones.

130
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,910
Chloe: <i>Indians?</i>

131
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:02,211
Native Americans, honey.

132
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,280
Lots of people have
Native-American ancestors.

133
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:06,415
He looks like an Indian.

134
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:08,051
Your father will explain.

135
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,351
It's not fair.

136
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:12,955
Joey's ancestor is Christopher Columbus.

137
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:15,224
Abigail: Mmm, he killed lots of Indians.

138
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,927
- That's not helpful.
- That's actually true.

139
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:19,128
Ed.

140
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,798
I don't wanna do a family tree.

141
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,966
Well, you have to, honey.
It's the assignment.

142
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:26,020
You wanna do well in school, right, Chloe?

143
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:27,386
Listen to your sister.

144
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,971
If you don't excel in first grade,
you won't get into private school.

145
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:31,807
And then you can forget about Stanford.

146
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:33,675
And then what's the point?

147
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:35,143
Don't listen to your sister.

148
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:37,179
How much longer are we gonna
beat this dead horse?

149
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:39,147
- <i>I was just kidding.</i>
- Wait, who beats horses?

150
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:42,550
- (phone ringing)
- Nobody, honey.

151
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:44,986
- Hello?
- Renata:<i> May I speak to Madeline, please?</i>

152
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:46,888
Yeah, one sec.

153
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,890
(whispers) Renata Klein.

154
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:50,325
Really?

155
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:52,794
Hello?

156
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:54,562
Madeline, it's Renata.

157
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:56,397
<i>Mm-hmm. What's up?</i>

158
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,168
Well, had a little bit
of a long night of the soul

159
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,271
last night, and, uh,

160
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:05,740
well, I think you were right.

161
00:08:05,742 --> 00:08:07,441
- I see.
- <i>It was wrong of me</i>

162
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:09,309

Oh, you are so sweet,

173

How late will the party be going until?

177

<i>3:00.</i>

178
00:08:40,075 --> 00:08:42,075
No, we won't be back by then.

179
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:45,779
But there's gotta be something
we can do, right?

180

<i>Okay, how about this?</i>

184
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:54,254
Chloe and the others come to the party,

big smiles on their faces, right?

186
00:08:56,291 --> 00:09:02,028

I'll even get Snow White
to sit on your husband's face.

<i>You are so sweet.</i>

193

00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:30,841
Because right now it's "Avenue Q,"

320
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:32,610
and next week it'll be "Book of Mormon,"

321
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:34,145
and then it'll be
the books that we can read

322
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:35,580
or the films our children can watch.

323
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:38,015
I told the mayor we might
consider legal recourse

324
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:39,384
'cause of how far along we are.

325
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:40,985
He basically laughed.

326
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:42,587
Plus I'd have to solicit city council

327
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:44,389
to even get funding to retain a lawyer.

328
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:46,157
I have a lawyer. She's amazing.

329
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,093
Her name is Celeste Wright.
She worked for a huge firm.

330
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:51,796
Maddie, I haven't even told these guys.
They don't know.

331
00:15:51,798 --> 00:15:53,798
It just pisses me off,
because in large part

332
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,332
this has to do with Renata Klein

333
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:58,002
having this mayor
and this town by the balls.

334
00:15:58,004 --> 00:15:59,904
And if city council were to see somebody

335
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:03,307
like the... the likes of Celeste and
Perry Wright on the other side of this,

336
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:06,476
they would have to pay attention.

337
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:08,612
Why... why are you laughing?

338
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:10,981
You're such a bulldog.

339
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:12,416
It's because I care.

340
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:14,685
Will you just try and get
a meeting with the mayor?

341
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:18,288
- (cell phone buzzing)
- Your work is too good, Joseph.

342
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,593
Hello?

343
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:25,495
Yeah. Are you okay?

344
00:16:25,497 --> 00:16:29,499
Her GPA was 3.9 coming into the
year, so, you know, it's early.

345
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:31,034
- <i>(cell phone chimes)</i>
- We don't have to panic.

346
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:32,469
What are you doing? Stop that.

347
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:34,804
But to see such a precipitous
drop in performance

348
00:16:34,806 --> 00:16:37,107
makes me think that there's
usually something else going on.

349
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:40,344
- Are you taking drugs?
- No, it's not drugs.

350
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:41,515
Then what is this about?

351
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:42,513
- Is this about a boy?
- No.

352
00:16:42,514 --> 00:16:43,813
Madeline...

353
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:45,515
sorry, is it okay
if I call you Madeline?

354
00:16:45,517 --> 00:16:47,083
As opposed to what? Arthur?

355
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:50,186
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

356
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:52,222
Yes, you can call me Madeline.

357
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,258
It seems that Abigail

358
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,159
is under a bit of stress at home.

359
00:16:57,161 --> 00:16:59,895
Is this about Ed
threatening your father?

360
00:16:59,897 --> 00:17:01,464
Did he tell you about that?

361
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:03,332
It isn't that.

362
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:05,167
Um...

363
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:06,869
Madeline: <i>Then what's it about, honey?</i>

364
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:09,004
Abigail: I feel this burden or pressure.

365
00:17:10,074 --> 00:17:11,840
I don't know how to be perfect.

366
00:17:13,544 --> 00:17:14,971
Excuse me?

367
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,156
Whether it's I need to get into Stanford...

368
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:19,768
<i>- Hey, if this is about the SAT tutor...</i>
- Maybe you should just let her finish.

369
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:22,505
- I'm speaking to my daughter right now.
- Mom!

370
00:17:25,523 --> 00:17:27,356
Go ahead. She can handle it.

371
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:29,324
Handle what?

372
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:31,794
There are a lot of high-powered
women who live here.

373
00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:34,763
Some run banks, others run Google

374
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:36,665
or Yahoo and...

375
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:38,633
sometimes I feel like you're grooming me

376
00:17:38,635 --> 00:17:42,637
to get to a place you, um, couldn't.

377
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:47,509
I think, uh, it would just be best

378
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:49,477
if I go live with Dad for a while.

379
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,985
- I... I just did not...
- I feel like I can't be myself at home.

380
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:01,389
Have you been discussing this with him?

381
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:02,857
No.

382
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:05,760
I don't even think I was
totally aware of how much I...

383
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:08,763
until Ms. Brewster
and I started talking.

384
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:11,366
<i>Mom, I just need a change, okay?</i>

385
00:18:11,368 --> 00:18:15,169
I think it would be better for me

386
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:16,838
spiritually.

387
00:18:19,676 --> 00:18:21,843
<i>- (seagulls screeching)</i>
- Ed:<i> It's my fault.</i>

388
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:24,479
<i>I never should have
gotten into it with Nathan.</i>

389
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:26,715
No, it's my fault.

390
00:18:26,717 --> 00:18:28,182
I pushed her too hard.

391
00:18:28,184 --> 00:18:30,819
I always push too hard.

392
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:32,687
Honey, look at me.

393
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:41,528
Hey.

394
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,932
You are not losing her, okay?

395
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:48,836
- (sniffles)
- You and Abby are so close.

396
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:51,972
Maybe too close,
which is why she feels...

397
00:18:51,974 --> 00:18:55,609
She wouldn't leave
if she knew I had cancer.

398
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:57,878
Well, you don't have cancer.

399
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,614
But I'd be willing to get it.

400
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:02,716
- <i>This is rough, Ed.</i>
- I know.

401
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:05,552
Your only crime is
you were too good a parent.

402
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:10,223
I mean, you have raised a
strong-minded, autonomous young woman

403
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:13,393
who can think for herself,
who can express her feelings,

404
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:18,330
and she's equipped to make
pretty big life decisions.

405
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:22,502
She is an extraordinary person

406
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:24,737
just like her mom.

407
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:29,174
Thank you.

408
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,345
I'm gonna get better.

409
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:17,121
(panting)

410
00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:24,929
Renata: All right, Adam,
where do we stand?

411
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:26,697
What? Lowlife scumbag.

412
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:29,533
Pricks who have a company that
fits really well with ours.

413
00:20:29,535 --> 00:20:31,869
Don't worry, he'll buy it. Okay,
here's what you're gonna do.

414
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,938
You're gonna go into Malcom and
tell him we have a new deal.

415
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,174
And sweeten the executive
stock options pool.

416
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:39,643
Yeah, let's keep these prepubescents
flush in skateboards.

417
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:43,247
All right, now stop picking
your noses and get this done.

418
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:45,649
No, it's a fair price. They'll cave.

419
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:47,952
Don't worry.
Oh, and a three-year vest, okay?

420
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:50,788
No shorter. Yeah, they
gotta stay to get paid.

421
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,191
- Gordon: I will take care of it.
- Okay, call me when it's done.

422
00:20:53,193 --> 00:20:55,292
- Gordon: You let me worry about it.
- Renata:<i> Yeah.</i>

423
00:20:57,062 --> 00:20:59,429
I think Amabella should go to therapy.

424
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,165
Therapy?

425
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:04,902
(sighs) It couldn't hurt.

426
00:21:06,338 --> 00:21:09,306
She's six. (chuckles)

427
00:21:09,308 --> 00:21:12,309
Yeah, but she's gifted,

428
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:14,177
which makes her intuitively advanced

429
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:16,647
and emotionally more vulnerable.

430
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:18,382
Honey...

431
00:21:18,384 --> 00:21:19,817
Please don't "honey" me.

432
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,920
<i>I know she enjoyed her party,</i>

433
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:25,856
but you have to admit her
excitement seemed tempered,

434
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:29,626
and that's because Chloe and a couple of
other favorite friends weren't there.

435
00:21:29,628 --> 00:21:32,061
Yeah, but to seek medical help?

436
00:21:32,063 --> 00:21:33,763
Medical? It's not medical.

437
00:21:33,765 --> 00:21:37,333
Gordon, don't be so old-fashioned.
Come on.

438
00:21:37,335 --> 00:21:38,801
I just... we've talked about this.

439
00:21:38,803 --> 00:21:40,737
Amabella internalizes.

440
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:42,238
<i>And a social slight could cause</i>

441
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,874
<i>more psychological harm than a choking.</i>

442
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:47,443
I come back to "she's six."

443
00:21:47,445 --> 00:21:48,745
(sighs)

444
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:53,182
Well, trust me, those
wounds can last forever.

445
00:21:53,184 --> 00:21:56,953
And she doesn't need to know she's
seeing a child psychologist.

446
00:21:56,955 --> 00:21:59,455
Some of the best ones
now dress up as clowns.

447
00:21:59,457 --> 00:22:03,125
We... we could sell it
as another birthday surprise.

448
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:04,793
You're laughing at me?

449
00:22:04,795 --> 00:22:09,065
Gordon, please, I spend all day
long never letting my guard down.

450
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:11,100
Just let me be a scared mom.

451
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:12,868
It's our daughter.

452
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,470
(winces)

453
00:22:19,743 --> 00:22:24,380
Look, one of the things
that makes you so successful

454
00:22:24,382 --> 00:22:27,616
is that you're able to see every hiccup.

455
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:29,718
You know, it's...
it's one of your many gifts.

456
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,688
So one of the pitfalls is that you tend

457
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,591
to way overthink everything.

458
00:22:35,593 --> 00:22:37,593
Amabella had a great time at the party.

459
00:22:37,595 --> 00:22:38,826
How could she not?

460
00:22:38,828 --> 00:22:41,062
That thing blew Disney on Ice away.

461
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,601
Have I become tragically unfun?

462
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:48,103
Oh, honey, no.

463
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:49,637
Come on, no, of course not.

464
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:51,539
Oh, my God, I have.

465
00:22:53,343 --> 00:22:55,042
I'm now one of those people

466
00:22:55,044 --> 00:22:57,979
I swore I would never
turn myself into...

467
00:22:57,981 --> 00:23:01,316
- some corporate, controlling, anxious...
- No, don't.

468
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:03,118
Don't. Stop it!

469
00:23:05,255 --> 00:23:07,355
On our third date, we went skydiving.

470
00:23:07,357 --> 00:23:10,258
- Do you remember that?
- Indeed I do.

471
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,527
Well, I think that was the last time

472
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:16,296
I let myself just free fall.

473
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:21,135
When did we become
past our spontaneous prime?

474
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,906
You want spontaneous?

475
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:28,609
Let's make love on that desk right now.

476
00:23:28,611 --> 00:23:30,477
No, you know what? I take that back.

477
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:32,946
- Let's fuck on that desk right now.
- Don't make fun of me.

478
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:34,781
I am not making fun of you.
I am looking at my wife.

479
00:23:34,783 --> 00:23:37,351
I wanna fuck her
right here and right now.

480
00:23:37,353 --> 00:23:38,985
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Why not?

481
00:23:38,987 --> 00:23:41,087
Ridiculous is totally
commensurate with free falling.

482
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:43,423
- Take off your clothes.
- (laughing)

483
00:23:43,425 --> 00:23:45,559
- Gordon...
- Do I have to rip them off?

484
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:48,461
- People will see.
- No one will see.

485
00:23:48,463 --> 00:23:51,397
Well, they'll hear. You know how I get.

486
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,767
Fine, no desk.

487
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:55,968
Bathroom.

488
00:23:57,805 --> 00:23:59,572
- Welcome, welcome.
- Thank you very much.

489
00:23:59,574 --> 00:24:02,007
- The office is in that way.
- Mm-hmm.

490
00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:06,579
- Okay.
- Go ahead, yeah.

491
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:07,946
- On the couch?
- Yes.

492
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:09,649
- Okay.
- Yes.

493
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:12,618
Well, so what brings you here today?

494
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:17,323
- Maybe... all right.
- (nervous chuckling)

495
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:20,059
So, you're free to talk about anything.

496
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:24,296
A lot of couples experience
a death of passion, um...

497
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,831
Celeste: <i>Passion is
definitely not our problem.</i>

498
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,367
If it is, maybe it's because
there's too much of it.

499
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:30,402
(laughing)

500
00:24:30,404 --> 00:24:31,869
How do you mean?

501
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:38,109
Well, we love each other very much.

502
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:40,178
Yeah.

503
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,546
And, um...

504
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,083
(sighs)

505
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:47,051
I just think maybe we...

506
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,823
things can just get a bit volatile.

507
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,358
Volatile how?

508
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:57,995
We fight a lot and we say things.

509
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,599
Um, we yell, we scream, and...

510
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,300
(sighs)

511
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,903
We just have a lot of anger

512
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:08,740
that we need some help controlling.

513
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:14,311
When you talk of anger and volatility...

514
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:18,816
are we talking about a
physical expression of anger?

515
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,387
No.

516
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,857
Just emotional, um...

517
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,360
verbal.

518
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,827
Mm.

519
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:35,098
It's not... not quite true.

520
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,537
After we fight, we...

521
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:45,408
ahem, we very often make love.

522
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,379
I don't know if you can
call it making love.

523
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,381
It's very...

524
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,583
um, there seems to be a lot of anger,

525
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,685
you know, mixed up in it, and...

526
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,187
Mm-hmm.

527
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:01,792
Well, there's a line
between passion and...

528
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:03,894
and rage, and...

529
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,365
and, you know, sometimes maybe we...

530
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,933
we cross that.

531
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,403
Sometimes.

532
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,605
Where do you think this rage comes from?

533
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,009
I don't know.

534
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,844
I don't even know how to begin

535
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,946
to answer that question.

536
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:25,381
Try.

537
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,385
Okay, um...

538
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,826
I... I think I'm afraid of losing her.

539
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:42,997
Okay. Why do you think that?

540
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:45,033
(chuckles) Have you...
have you seen her?

541
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:48,069
Look at her. (nervous chuckling)

542
00:26:48,071 --> 00:26:51,506
Uh, she can have any man
she wants, you know.

543
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:53,342
And if she's not happy with me,

544
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:56,110
there will be a line of a thousand men

545
00:26:56,112 --> 00:26:57,579
just waiting, you know.

546
00:26:57,581 --> 00:26:59,247
(sniffles)

547
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:02,317
Uh... yeah.

548
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,454
And lately, it doesn't always
seem that she's happy.

549
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:09,491
And that, uh...

550
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:12,894
that terrifies me.

551
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:15,664
From the very beginning,
like when we first met,

552
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:17,698
I've always...

553
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,834
worried that she would
just go through me.

554
00:27:19,836 --> 00:27:21,169
You know, like that...

555
00:27:21,171 --> 00:27:23,537
What do you mean by that?
By "go through you"?

556
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:28,076
That she would...

557
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:30,078
outgrow me, maybe.

558
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,848
Or figure me out or something.

559
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,984
So I've always had this sense that...

560
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:42,490
that, you know, the day would
come where she would just...

561
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:45,026
where she would just
not love me anymore, and...

562
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,864
and I...

563
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:52,833
I think I'm constantly looking
for evidence that she...

564
00:27:52,835 --> 00:27:55,669
Evidence that she doesn't...
doesn't love you anymore.

565
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:01,174
Celeste, how do you feel
about what Perry just said?

566
00:28:01,176 --> 00:28:03,511
I gave up my career for you.

567
00:28:03,513 --> 00:28:04,845
I-I...

568
00:28:04,847 --> 00:28:07,114
<i>I left my family.</i>

569
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:08,582
<i>I left my friends.</i>

570
00:28:08,584 --> 00:28:10,551
<i>I moved here for you.</i>

571
00:28:10,553 --> 00:28:12,453
You honestly think I don't love you?

572
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:15,155
A couple of days ago, you
said that you would leave me.

573
00:28:15,157 --> 00:28:17,391
Wha...? (scoffs)

574
00:28:17,393 --> 00:28:19,359
What occasioned that?

575
00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:21,562
(sighs)

576
00:28:25,468 --> 00:28:26,534
Anybody?

577
00:28:30,105 --> 00:28:31,704
I grabbed her...

578
00:28:33,675 --> 00:28:37,610
(stutters) by the... I
grabbed her by the shoulders

579
00:28:37,612 --> 00:28:38,845
pretty hard.

580
00:28:42,884 --> 00:28:48,221
So, the idea that it's never
gotten violent is, uh...

581
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:52,292
I grabbed her hard.

582
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:53,760
And then she said that if I...

583
00:28:53,762 --> 00:28:56,096
if I ever do that again,
she would leave me.

584
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,834
He frightened me and...

585
00:29:00,836 --> 00:29:03,202
Has this ever happened before?

586
00:29:05,573 --> 00:29:07,739
<i>(Celeste sighs)</i>

587
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,509
(sniffles)

588
00:29:10,511 --> 00:29:11,444
Yeah.

589
00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:17,316
Sometimes I lash out.

590
00:29:18,353 --> 00:29:20,386
And, you, Celeste?

591
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:23,222
What about me?

592
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:25,491
Do you ever lash out?

593
00:29:27,495 --> 00:29:29,828
Yeah, when it gets
physical, I fight back.

594
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,897
(sniffles) I do.

595
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:33,632
And how does that feel,
when this happens?

596
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:35,434
Not good.

597
00:29:35,436 --> 00:29:36,702
I don't feel good about it.

598
00:29:36,704 --> 00:29:38,736
Can you be more specific?

599
00:29:45,345 --> 00:29:47,645
I think I feel ashamed.

600
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:51,483
- Ashamed...?
- Yeah.

601
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:56,888
We get angry.

602
00:29:58,158 --> 00:30:00,658
We fight and we...

603
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:05,397
we then have this crazy, angry sex.

604
00:30:06,866 --> 00:30:08,900
(exhales)

605
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,437
And then we make up, and it's...

606
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:16,674
it's all better, and...

607
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:18,809
(sighs)

608
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:20,678
And we have this...

609
00:30:22,882 --> 00:30:24,348
dirty secret.

610
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,850
Hmm.

611

618
00:30:52,878 --> 00:30:54,811
Okay, our first order of business today

619
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:57,781
regards our Annual Fall Gala Fundraiser.

620
00:30:57,783 --> 00:31:00,484
Now, given the unprecedented success
of last year's Trivia Night

621
00:31:00,486 --> 00:31:02,453
with the theme "Dead Celebrities,"

622
00:31:02,455 --> 00:31:05,694
we've decided to come back again
with yet another costume gala,

623
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:07,423
this year titled

624
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:09,744
- "Elvis and Audrey Night."
- <i>(door opens)</i>

625
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:13,997
<i>I think it should make for a splendid...</i>

626
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:18,334
- (sotto voce) Oh, God.
- ...evening filled with fun,

627
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:20,103
fashion, frivolity,

628
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:23,907
<i>one which should raise
some much-needed funding...</i>

629
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:26,275
<i>and I'm looking at you, Bruce Pedulla...</i>

630
00:31:26,277 --> 00:31:30,914
<i>going to the benefit of all our
wonderful, wonderful children.</i>

631
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:33,783
<i>Right? Right. Okay, great.</i>

632
00:31:33,785 --> 00:31:35,485
<i>Any questions?</i>

633
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:37,787
<i>Yes, Mrs. Cunningham.</i>

634
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:40,389
Thea: <i>We all dress as
either Elvis or Audrey?</i>

635
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:42,191
<i>Same costumes for everybody?</i>

636
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:45,996
Yes. Part of the fun will be
seeing a different interpretation.

637
00:31:45,998 --> 00:31:48,131
- Do you know her?
- Nippal:<i> Any other questions?</i>

638
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:50,500
- I don't know. Do I?
- Nippal: Progress. Moving on.

639
00:31:50,502 --> 00:31:52,167
(laughing)

640
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:55,237
Of all the people they want me to
pretend to be... Audrey Hepburn.

641
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:57,172
Great, I'll be the spitting image.

642
00:31:57,174 --> 00:31:59,307
- Nathan: Hey, Maddie?
- (Madeline sighs) Great.

643
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:01,610
- Hi, Nathan. Hello, Bonnie.
- Hi.

644
00:32:01,612 --> 00:32:03,879
- Ed.
- Nathan.

645
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:06,181
Um, can I steal you for a second?

646
00:32:06,183 --> 00:32:07,282
Mmm.

647
00:32:09,754 --> 00:32:14,289
Um, it's about this whole Abby thing.

648
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:15,758
That was not my doing.

649
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,527
I'm as surprised as you are.

650
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:19,728
Okay.

651
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,797
So, are you... are you
all right with this?

652
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:25,099
I suppose at this point I have to be.

653
00:32:25,101 --> 00:32:29,737
She has a very well-developed
sense of self-awareness, so...

654
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,839
if she thinks it's what's best, then...

655
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:35,210
That's very mature of you.

656
00:32:35,212 --> 00:32:37,845
We'll take good care of her.

657
00:32:37,847 --> 00:32:41,683
Um, there's something
that's a little off-subject,

658
00:32:41,685 --> 00:32:43,485
but not really.

659
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:46,788
Would you mind just discretely
checking your husband right now?

660
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,123
Do you see the way he's staring at me?

661
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,294
I think he wants to fight me.

662
00:32:52,296 --> 00:32:55,497
Don't be ridiculous. Ed doesn't fight.

663
00:32:58,034 --> 00:33:00,668
Maddie, I just wanted to say

664
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,437
that I know that you're her mother.

665
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,773
And Abigail knows it, too.

666
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,776
I will never try to encroach, ever.

667
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,090
Sorry.

668
00:33:26,294 --> 00:33:28,394
- (crowd shouting)
- All right, good cut, Timmy. Good cut.

669
00:33:28,396 --> 00:33:30,663
You're all right. Keep your eye
on the ball next time, okay?

670
00:33:30,665 --> 00:33:33,399
Good cut, good cut. Who's next?

671
00:33:33,401 --> 00:33:35,568
<i>- Come on.</i>
- Man:<i> Come on, George.</i>

672
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,904
Woman: Come on, Jessie. You can do it!

673
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:41,074
- Do I have to?
- Yep. Mm-hmm.

674
00:33:41,076 --> 00:33:43,076
We talked about this.
I need you to try it once.

675
00:33:43,078 --> 00:33:44,745
And if you don't like it, I'll
never make you do it again.

676
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:46,613
I just wanna go play on the playground.

677
00:33:46,615 --> 00:33:48,949
I know, but you might actually like it.

678
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:50,751
- (nasally) Okay?
- (laughs) Okay.

679
00:33:50,753 --> 00:33:52,418
(nasally) I love you.

680
00:33:55,991 --> 00:33:59,091
- Woman #2: <i>Come on, guys!
- (cell phone buzzing)</i>

681
00:33:59,093 --> 00:34:01,861
<i>- (whistle trills)</i>
- Boy:<i> You can do it, Blue!</i>

682
00:34:01,863 --> 00:34:03,395
Hey.

683
00:34:03,397 --> 00:34:05,497
- Missed you at the meeting.
- <i>I know. I'm sorry.</i>

684
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:06,932
<i>I'm at tee-ball with Ziggy.</i>

685
00:34:06,934 --> 00:34:09,168
Just trying to get him more involved.

686
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,403
<i>Savor the moment because, trust me,</i>

687
00:34:11,405 --> 00:34:13,939
- they grow up.
- <i>Are you okay?</i>

688
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:17,509
Abigail's decided she wants
to go live with her father.

689
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:19,544
Jane: <i>I'm so sorry.</i>

690
00:34:19,546 --> 00:34:22,081
Madeline: <i>Now I don't have
to cook all that vegan crap.</i>

691
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:24,950
<i>Hey, can I call you back?
Ziggy's about up to bat.</i>

692
00:34:24,952 --> 00:34:27,853
- Yeah, go. Call me later.
- <i>Okay, bye.</i>

693
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,601
Now, keep your eye right on the ball

694
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:44,269
and swing as level as you can.

695
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:46,605
Okay, buddy? All right, here we go.

696
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:50,942
- You got this, baby!
- Any time you're ready, Zig.

697
00:34:50,944 --> 00:34:53,878
- (crowd cheering)
- Run, run, run, run! Run, Ziggy, run!

698
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,480
<i>- Run, run, run!</i>
- Jane:<i> Go, baby! Go, go, go!</i>

699
00:34:55,482 --> 00:34:56,915
Coach: <i>Go to second, go to second!</i>

700
00:34:56,917 --> 00:34:59,851
- Go, baby, go!
- Coach: <i>Go to third, go to third, Ziggy!</i>

701
00:34:59,853 --> 00:35:01,353
Jane: <i>Go, babe!</i>

702
00:35:01,355 --> 00:35:04,022
Coach: <i>Run, run, run!
Home run! Home run!</i>

703
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:05,856
<i>(cheering, applause)</i>

704
00:35:05,858 --> 00:35:07,090
<i>(coach chuckling)</i>

705
00:35:07,092 --> 00:35:09,293
Home run! Slap me some skin!

706
00:35:09,295 --> 00:35:12,363
Oh, my God, you did it!

707
00:35:12,365 --> 00:35:13,497
Ah!

708
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:29,079
You cannot ruin this one.

709
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:31,449
It's hand wash only,
so make sure and tell Bonnie,

710
00:35:31,451 --> 00:35:33,183
or I guess you can tell your dad.

711
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:36,086
Maybe your dad does the laundry now.

712
00:35:36,088 --> 00:35:38,588
Maybe he does.

713
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,457
I was thinking

714
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:42,859
now that you are gone a little bit,

715
00:35:42,861 --> 00:35:45,428
maybe we could have
some girlfriend time.

716
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:49,632
That'd be cool.

717
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:53,135
Are you ever coming back?

718
00:35:53,137 --> 00:35:54,671
Abigail: <i>Yeah, of course.</i>

719
00:35:54,673 --> 00:35:56,473
<i>I'm gonna come back all the time.</i>

720
00:35:58,276 --> 00:36:00,477
I made a playlist for you.

721
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:05,648
Are you trying to take my room?

722
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,183
Can I?

723
00:36:07,185 --> 00:36:09,218
No, you can't.

724
00:36:10,988 --> 00:36:14,322
Abigail: Maybe when I
go to college, though.

725
00:36:14,324 --> 00:36:16,492
- We should go get pizza.
- It's all right.

726
00:36:16,494 --> 00:36:17,659
What are you talking about?

727
00:36:17,661 --> 00:36:18,994
Baby, you just hit a home run

728
00:36:18,996 --> 00:36:20,562
on your very first try!

729
00:36:20,564 --> 00:36:22,182
I think you're actually
the first kid in history

730
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:23,776
to ever do that.

731
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:25,516
(sighs)

732
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:27,669
Come on, you have to be
a little bit excited.

733
00:36:27,671 --> 00:36:29,037
Did you see those parents' faces?

734
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,906
Everybody was like...
they were screaming!

735
00:36:30,908 --> 00:36:33,041
I was screaming! It was so good!

736
00:36:33,043 --> 00:36:35,444
We have to do my family tree.

737
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:37,178
No, that's not due for another week.

738
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,714
It's due tomorrow.

739
00:36:38,716 --> 00:36:41,617
No. No, it's due on the...

740
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:43,251
the 27th, I think.

741
00:36:43,253 --> 00:36:45,620
I put it in my calendar,

742
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:48,188
'cause I didn't wanna forget that...

743
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,824
Oh, fuck.

744
00:36:51,027 --> 00:36:52,627
What did you say?

745
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:54,462
Nothing. Sorry.

746
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:57,665
(whispering) Are you fucking kidding me?

747
00:37:09,278 --> 00:37:10,511
- Hey. God.
- Hey!

748
00:37:10,513 --> 00:37:12,914
- Thank you so much.
- Do not worry.

749
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:14,615
We've got this.

750
00:37:14,617 --> 00:37:16,150
Please, when Abigail was little,

751
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:17,517
I used to get everything late.

752
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:19,320
That's fine. Hi, Ziggy!

753
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:22,789
- I heard you hit a home run today!
- Yeah.

754
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:25,326
That is so exciting. Congratulations.

755
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:26,760
So, I organized some of the photos.

756
00:37:26,762 --> 00:37:28,728
Here's Grandma and Grandpa.

757
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,965
Cousins, brother, more cousins.

758
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:32,666
I don't know if they're
first or second, though,

759
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,068
because I'm not sure who they...

760
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,902
Okay, wait, first of all,
we have to draw the tree.

761
00:37:35,904 --> 00:37:37,304
That's the most important thing.

762
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:38,748
And they want it
actually on the cardboard.

763
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:39,731
Here you go, honey.

764
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:41,585
The assignment said
the child has to contribute.

765
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,210
Now, put the trunk on there.

766
00:37:43,212 --> 00:37:44,611
And you're gonna be in the trunk,

767
00:37:44,613 --> 00:37:46,447
and then your mom and dad
are then leaves.

768
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:49,383
And then we'll go from there.

769
00:37:49,385 --> 00:37:51,417
What about my father?

770
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:54,320
Um, we don't...

771
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:56,389
We need to put him in here.

772
00:37:56,391 --> 00:37:59,725
You don't have a dad, sweetie, so it's...
it's okay.

773
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:02,228
We'll use Grandma and Grandpa,
and me, and Great-Uncle Jimmy.

774
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,365
I still have to write
my dad's name on the board.

775
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:08,501
Well, you know, I said that,
but everybody's board

776
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:10,203
is gonna be a little bit different.

777
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:13,006
<i>You have to write down
both of your parents' names.</i>

778
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:14,573
<i>I'll get in trouble if I don't.</i>

779
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:16,809
No, you won't get in trouble.

780
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:18,978
<i>I want you to put it down.</i>

781
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,413
Ziggy.

782
00:38:20,415 --> 00:38:21,814
What is his name? Just write it down!

783
00:38:21,816 --> 00:38:23,049
I don't know. You know that.

784
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,651
I've told you this story so many times.

785
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:28,120
You know he would've loved you, but...

786
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:30,656
What is his name, for Christ's sakes?!

787
00:38:30,658 --> 00:38:32,858
Go to your room! That is not okay!

788
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,139
(shade whirring)

789
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,517
Madeline: <i>Have you ever
tried to look him up?</i>

790
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:34,986
Jane: <i>No.</i>

791
00:39:38,058 --> 00:39:40,558
He told me that his name
was Saxon Banks,

792
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,661
like Mr. Banks,
the dad in "Mary Poppins."

793
00:39:43,663 --> 00:39:47,465
- Mm-hmm.
- But I Googled him afterwards, and...

794
00:39:49,202 --> 00:39:51,335
We met in a bar.

795
00:39:51,337 --> 00:39:53,204
He was funny and sexy,

796
00:39:53,206 --> 00:39:55,039
and we were both pleasantly drunk.

797
00:39:56,509 --> 00:39:59,811
We got a hotel room
that overlooked the ocean.

798
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:02,847
<i>It was beautiful and romantic.</i>

799
00:40:07,987 --> 00:40:09,620
Ahem, and then he...

800
00:40:11,424 --> 00:40:12,490
<i>changed.</i>

801
00:40:12,492 --> 00:40:14,858
What do you mean he changed?

802
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:19,663
<i>(door closes)</i>

803
00:40:19,665 --> 00:40:23,100
Jane: <i>He became extremely aggressive.</i>

804
00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:24,868
<i>(water dripping)</i>

805
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,604
<i>It was like he was operating</i>

806
00:40:26,606 --> 00:40:28,972
<i>some piece of machinery or something.</i>

807
00:40:28,974 --> 00:40:31,708
<i>It was just so rote.</i>

808
00:40:34,547 --> 00:40:37,314
<i>I tried to resist, but...</i>

809
00:40:37,316 --> 00:40:40,651
<i>he was way bigger than I was.</i>

810
00:40:42,354 --> 00:40:45,655
I eventually just stopped
resisting because...

811
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:50,693
I was actually afraid
that he would kill me.

812
00:40:56,134 --> 00:40:57,733
<i>(water dripping)</i>

813
00:41:03,441 --> 00:41:05,208
Jane: <i>He finished...</i>

814
00:41:06,545 --> 00:41:09,612
<i>got up, and, um...</i>

815
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:11,181
<i>said goodbye.</i>

816
00:41:11,183 --> 00:41:12,682
<i>(scoffs)</i>

817
00:41:13,851 --> 00:41:15,585
<i>And I said bye.</i>

818
00:41:17,555 --> 00:41:19,055
<i>That was it.</i>

819
00:41:19,057 --> 00:41:21,256
Oh, my God.

820
00:41:21,258 --> 00:41:25,027
But he gave me my Ziggy, so...

821
00:41:25,029 --> 00:41:26,595
Have you talked to anybody about this?

822
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:29,999
Like a therapist
or a counselor or someone?

823
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:32,334
You're the first person I've ever told.

824
00:41:32,336 --> 00:41:34,436
Oh, honey.

825
00:41:34,438 --> 00:41:36,972
There was a point where I
thought that I had moved on,

826
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:40,375
that I had worked
through it and whatnot,

827
00:41:40,377 --> 00:41:41,977
but, no.

828
00:41:41,979 --> 00:41:43,779
I know that I'll never be over it.

829
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:47,416
But I know that I have to keep
moving forward, you know?

830
00:41:47,418 --> 00:41:49,218
That kid is...

831
00:41:50,954 --> 00:41:52,921
he's gonna have a good life.

832
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:57,226
But the name of his father

833
00:41:57,228 --> 00:42:00,128
is not going on that
fucking poster board.

834
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:12,107
(sighs)

835
00:42:13,577 --> 00:42:15,076
(tires squeal)

836
00:42:17,047 --> 00:42:19,180
(engine turns off)

837
00:42:23,086 --> 00:42:25,620
(sobbing)

838
00:42:41,571 --> 00:42:43,371
(engine starts)

839
00:43:09,731 --> 00:43:12,599
- Renata: You're never gonna believe this.
- Hey.

840
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:15,034
The theme for the school party

841
00:43:15,036 --> 00:43:17,970
is Elvis Presley and Audrey Hepburn.

842
00:43:17,972 --> 00:43:19,773
Oh, dear God, no.

843
00:43:19,775 --> 00:43:22,542
Exactly. Where's Amabella?

844
00:43:23,945 --> 00:43:25,545
She's in her room.

845
00:43:28,016 --> 00:43:30,417
I'm admiring how beautiful...

846
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:34,954
Remember after the remodel,
we just walked around,

847
00:43:34,956 --> 00:43:37,856
staring at how perfect everything was?

848
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:41,159
Can't make a perfect world.

849
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:43,762
No matter what, shit happens.

850
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:51,102
It felt really nice to be desired today.

851
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:53,038
(chuckles)

852
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,774
It meant a lot. Thank you.

853
00:43:57,144 --> 00:44:01,714
Honey, I always desire you.

854
00:44:01,716 --> 00:44:04,783
Usually, it just annoys you.

855
00:44:04,785 --> 00:44:05,951
No.

856
00:44:05,953 --> 00:44:08,920
You want to have sex all the time.

857
00:44:10,658 --> 00:44:13,123
Today, you desired me.

858
00:44:19,966 --> 00:44:21,666
(moans)

859
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:36,481

860
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,723
- <i>(banging on door)</i>
- Okay.

861

862

Harper: <i>We still don't
know the truth about Jane.</i>

865
00:45:06,645 --> 00:45:08,445
I'm just saying.

866
00:45:18,891 --> 00:45:20,857
Gabrielle: <i>Madeline had anger issues.</i>

867
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:23,259
Itty bitty ball of rage.

868
00:45:23,261 --> 00:45:24,795
(horn honking)

869
00:45:24,797 --> 00:45:27,798
Harper: <i>Wanna see her rage issues?</i>

870
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,866
<i>Call her "itty bitty."</i>

871
00:45:29,868 --> 00:45:33,236

Melissa: <i>Oh, yeah, that Bonnie's
just the sweetest thing.</i>

874
00:45:38,811 --> 00:45:40,577
Yeah, right.

875
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:43,112
Nippal: <i>Celeste... she is
an accomplished attorney,</i>

876
00:45:43,114 --> 00:45:45,181
and some people
in this town resent that.

877

Rich, beautiful, madly in love.

878
00:45:49,554 --> 00:45:51,053

Hey.

881
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,066
What are you thinking?

882
00:46:06,136 --> 00:46:10,172
I'm trying to decide
whether I'm happy or sad.

883
00:46:10,174 --> 00:46:12,040
People usually know.

884
00:46:16,714 --> 00:46:18,614
I'm sad because...

885
00:46:21,151 --> 00:46:24,419
because my husband
doubts my love for him.

886
00:46:26,423 --> 00:46:27,889
And happy...?

887
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,959
I'm happy because the first time

888
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:33,195
in a long time, I'm hopeful.

889

3
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:47,960
No!

4
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,072
- The shooting range?
- Jane.

5
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:12,840
What were you doing there?

6
00:04:12,842 --> 00:04:15,376
Target practice. I
try to go once a month.

7
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:17,278
You were doing target practice?

8
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,980
Mm-hmm. You seem suspicious.

9
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:23,518
Well, we're going on a road trip to
go meet the person that assaulted you,

10
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,985
and you're doing target practice?

11
00:04:24,987 --> 00:04:26,454
I'm not suspicious at all.

12
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:28,155
I'm not planning on shooting the man.

13
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:30,089
- Oh, my God.
- I just...

14
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:31,991
I have a thing about guns to begin with.

15
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:34,027
Nathan and I used to
fight about it constantly.

16
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:35,962
He's obsessed with guns.

17
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:38,097
All those mass shootings. I don't know.

18
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:40,334
It's actually helped
me a lot, owning one.

19
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:41,468
Really?

20
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,902
They say just holding one in your hand

21
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:45,271
has psychological benefits
for emotional trauma.

22
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:47,406
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.

23
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:49,342
Yeah, because it inhibits mentalization,

24
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:52,077
so it helps you block
yourself off from emotions.

25
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,313
- And that's a good thing?
- Yeah.

26
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:57,082
If the memories are
painful enough, absolutely.

27
00:04:58,353 --> 00:05:00,786
You know, I feel stronger with one,

28
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:02,488
more empowered.

29
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,457
- Hey, ladies.
- Oh, hi.

30
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,560
Maybe I should get a gun.

31
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:10,094
There's more than one person

32
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:12,096
I'd like to shoot in this town.

33
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:14,366
No, sweet pea, that's dirty.

34
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:16,501
Come on, you can't go to a
playdate in dirty clothes.

35
00:05:16,503 --> 00:05:19,371
In this town, they'll
report me to child services.

36
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:21,505
You can leave in a mess, but don't...

37
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,274
- Amabella.
- What?

38
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:25,609
What happened?

39
00:05:26,746 --> 00:05:28,645
Did somebody bite you?

The mayor just gave the okay.

46
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:48,631
That is fantastic.

47
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:49,999

We were all just playing.

53
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:01,777
- Share with us.
- Was it that Ziggy?

54
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,344
- I don't know!
- All right!

55
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:05,113
Well, just tell us! All
right? It's not all right!

56
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,882
- She's being bullied!
- Renata!

57
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:09,518
- Oh, my God! It's a bite!
- Just keep your voice down.

58
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,420
Someone is biting our daughter!

59
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:14,354
Oh, my God, okay.

60
00:06:14,356 --> 00:06:17,725
Honey, Mommy is getting very upset.

61
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:21,729
I'm getting very, very upset

62
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:24,298
because someone is bullying you.

63
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,700
And you never let a bully win.

64
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:27,868
Do you hear me?

65
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,369
You have to speak up, Amabella.

66
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:33,506
You have to be a big girl and
use your voice in this world.

67
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:36,275
That's why they call me a bulldog,

68
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:38,711
because I had to learn how
to fight back with a bully.

69
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:42,081
I... we gotta clean this.

70
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,650
Okay, all right. Just...

71
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,919
Hey, you.

72
00:06:48,956 --> 00:06:51,490
Who's ever hurting you,

73
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:53,892
they might be harming somebody else.

74
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:56,094
And you wouldn't want that, huh?

75
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:57,663
You wouldn't want innocent
people getting hurt.

76
00:06:57,665 --> 00:06:59,331
You're too kind for that.

77
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,799
Huh?

78
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:01,900
Right?

79
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,242
What happened to your tennis game?

80
00:07:12,244 --> 00:07:13,845
Oh, I changed my mind.

81
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:18,282
Where are the boys?

82
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:21,250
They're at Judo.

83
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:23,553
You knew that.

84
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:28,424
What?

85
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:31,695
You decided to skip your
tennis game and, uh...

86
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:33,296
And, uh...

87
00:07:47,077 --> 00:07:49,144
Oh, baby.

88
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,051
People out there that say they
have satisfying sex lives...

89
00:07:58,087 --> 00:08:00,454
Give me a fucking break.

90
00:08:00,456 --> 00:08:03,424
Oh, God.

91
00:08:35,857 --> 00:08:36,989
"Why?

92
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:43,262
Are you having wild, torrid sex?"

93
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,102
Yeah, right.

94
00:09:02,414 --> 00:09:04,982
Do not use the downstairs
bathroom, honey.

95
00:09:06,518 --> 00:09:07,685
Jesus.

96
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,658
May... maybe we should
just take her out.

97
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,760
- Put her in a private school.
- What?

98
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:19,328
So she should have to go
instead of that little felon?

99
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,230
Oh, Renata, God, please.

100
00:09:21,232 --> 00:09:23,066
Oh! Do not tell me to calm down.

101
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:25,234
- I will take my hands...
- Can you take a breath...

102
00:09:25,236 --> 00:09:27,570
- and put them around your throat!
- for one second?

103
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:31,340
Is that better?

104
00:09:32,677 --> 00:09:34,577
You know, you should be more upset.

105
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:36,044
I'm very upset.

106
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:37,613
Oh, really? 'Cause I
don't see it, Gordon.

107
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:41,116
Do not make this a
referendum on my anger.

108
00:09:41,118 --> 00:09:43,785
That someone has been hurting
her for who knows how long,

109
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:45,887
that we haven't even known about it,

110
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,288
that we can't even stop it,

111
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,991
and that she won't even
talk to us about it...

112
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:50,792
- I know!
- Don't pull out your fucking scorecard

113
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:52,393
to total up who's got the most anger.

114
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:55,029
Oh, you're the one
that's getting mad at me?

115
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:58,332
Instead of some little fucker
who's chomping on our kid?

116
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:01,535
Will you just listen to
me for one goddamn minute?

117
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:03,738
I will not listen. That's
what I did last time.

118
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,074
Because I said to you
something's wrong with Amabella,

119
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:08,676
but you didn't want to hear it, huh?

120
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:11,377
I said let's take her
to a child psychiatrist.

121
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:13,446
- But you had a better idea, didn't you?
- What?

122
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:14,981
Taking me into your office bathroom

123
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:16,883
and fucking the shit out
of me on the fucking sink!

124
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:18,417
God damn it, will you
stop yelling at me?

125
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:19,886
God damn it!

126
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:21,655
Would you fucking...

127
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:26,159
You sure you don't wanna go
on the couch or in the bed?

128
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:28,193
You complain we never have
sex. Just shut up and fuck me.

129
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,762
Okay.

130
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:32,297
When I first meet a couple,
I visualize them fornicating.

131
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,532
I mean, I know that sounds crazy,

132
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,000
but with Madeline and Ed...

133
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,402
I just couldn't see it.

134
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,638
Okay, this is gonna take too long.

135
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,306
- Okay.
- Here, just like that.

136
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:44,742
Here.

137
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,610
It's me.

138
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,279
Hi, honey!

139
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,114
Is your playdate over already?

140
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,886
I'm hungry.

141
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,188
They didn't have food
at your friend's place?

142
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,458
Today's grocery day, so before
Abigail eats everything,

143
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,860
I wanted to...

144
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:07,164
Sorry, Mom.

145
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,598
It's okay.

146
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,667
See, I bought more of your
crap and less of her crap.

147
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,469
You know what? I'll make
you one of my special BLTs.

148
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:14,537
Give me 15?

149
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:15,872
Deal, my man!

150
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,940
Now you can go back to
whatever you were doing

151
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:19,508
or pretending not to.

152
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:23,012
Laundry room?

153
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:24,847
Only takes me five to make a BLT.

154
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:34,723
- Honey, come on.
- Hold on.

155
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:39,460
No, no, I don't know
about that. What is that?

156
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:41,629
One of her friends makes
mention of it on her Facebook page.

157
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:44,232
She said, "Is this the
shot you're going to use

158
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:46,201
on your secret project?" question mark.

159
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:50,304
"Is it sexy/slutty
enough?" question mark.

160
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:52,539
I mean, what kind of
project is this, Nathan?

161
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,041
Well, if it's a secret project,

162
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:56,243
then that's probably why
I don't know about it.

163
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:58,045
I mean, why are you on
Abby's Facebook page?

164
00:11:58,047 --> 00:11:59,546
How did she friend you?

165
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:01,448
I'm not her friend, I'm her mother.

166
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,118
And it's my job to be on
it and it's yours, too,

167
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,619
particularly when she's living with you.

168
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:07,955
You assume the obligation to parent,

169
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:09,488
which is what I guess
you've been pretty...

170
00:12:13,461 --> 00:12:15,762
She's gonna kill you.

171
00:12:15,764 --> 00:12:18,131
He hung up on me.

172
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:19,598
Ugh, what a fuck.

173
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,400
Watch your mouth, woman.

174
00:12:21,402 --> 00:12:24,703
Why are you never playing your
loud music when it's a good time?

175
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:27,973
Are you sure you should be snooping
around on her Facebook page?

176
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:29,407
I am her mother.

177
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:32,510
It is my fucking duty to spy on her.

178
00:12:32,512 --> 00:12:35,446
Last few days, I don't know
where your head has been.

179
00:12:39,386 --> 00:12:41,619
What are you... what
are you not telling me?

180
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:45,022
I mean,

181
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:49,293
I might have put something
stupid into motion.

182
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:50,427
Okay.

183
00:12:51,798 --> 00:12:54,899
Well, you know I told
you about Jane's past.

184
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:57,334
- She was sexually assaulted.
- Right.

185
00:12:57,336 --> 00:12:59,636
Well, I think I found her assaulter.

186
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:02,135
He's an interior decorator
in San Luis Obispo.

187
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,087
And?

188
00:13:03,112 --> 00:13:05,208
Well, Jane is determined
to confront him,

189
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:09,679
so Celeste made an appointment with him
next Wednesday, ostensibly to hire him,

190
00:13:09,681 --> 00:13:13,582
which probably was a
little bit more my idea.

191
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,985
And we're all just gonna
go down there and see.

192
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:18,187
No, you're not.

193
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:20,255
You are going to call the police.

194
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,224
But we don't even know if it's him, Ed.

195
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:23,325
Well, suppose it is.

196
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,393
The man is dangerous, right?

197
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:27,296
Well, I mean, there's
gonna be three of us

198
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:29,264
and we're in a crowded office space.

199
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,933
What, you're telling me Perry Wright

200
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,001
is letting Celeste go on this mission?

201
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:35,269
Well, Perry doesn't exactly know.

202
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:37,571
- Jane swore us to secrecy.
- All right.

203
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:39,473
But I was not gonna
let her go down there

204
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:41,342
and do that by herself.

205
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:43,777
Madeline, this is a bad idea.

206
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,713
Ed, she needs closure,

207
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:47,815
and I don't think I can
stop her at this point.

208
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:50,318
And I'm certainly not
gonna let her go alone.

209
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,453
Hello?

210
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,311
Hi, Emily Barnes here
from Otter Bay school.

211
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:09,468
Yeah, what's going on?

212
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,670
Um, listen.

213
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:13,205
We have a problem.

214
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:23,682
Fuck!

215
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:10,893
Fuck!

216
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:12,761
Sorry.

217
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:14,830
Sorry.

218
00:15:14,855 --> 00:15:18,790
So, does Ms. Barnes now think
that Ziggy bit Amabella?

219
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:20,002
I don't think so.

220
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,337
But because the Kleins came forward,

221
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,539
she feels like she had
to tell the principal.

222
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,108
And so now I have to go
meet with him tomorrow.

223
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,643
It's ridiculous.

224
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:30,178
You might have to be a lawyer again.

225
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,746
Did you ask Ziggy if he bit her?

226
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:33,547
Yeah, of course, but he said no.

227
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:37,351
Ugh, it's just never
over in this fucking town

228
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,420
that I wish to fucking
God I never came to.

229
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:40,787
- Don't say that.
- I don't think this is a good week

230
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:42,456
to be going to San Luis Obispo.

231
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,692
No, I'm fine. I just...

232
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,893
I'm fine.

233
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:49,996
Ed is insisting on going with us.

234
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:51,297
I didn't want to tell him,

235
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:53,166
but he knew I was keeping
something from him.

236
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:56,002
He says it's not safe, and I
think he might be right, you guys.

237
00:15:56,004 --> 00:15:58,504
It might be better to
have him there with us.

238
00:15:58,506 --> 00:16:00,573
Madeline?

239
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:02,308
Sorry to interrupt.

240
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,943
Can I talk to you, please?

241
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:05,911
Yeah. Of course.

242
00:16:05,913 --> 00:16:07,245
I'll be right back.

243
00:16:08,782 --> 00:16:10,048
Yeah.

244
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:21,193
- What?
- We need to talk.

245
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:23,528
When I came to the theater,
you did not want to talk to me.

246
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,662
- Let's take a drive.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

247
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:27,498
Do you want me to say
what I've got to say here?

248
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,401
'Cause I can't promise decorum.

249
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:33,104
- Okay.
- Okay.

250
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:46,483
I don't want to talk about the other day.

251
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:48,084
Then what is this about?

252
00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:49,785
Oh, I'm sorry to be such an annoyance.

253
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:51,121
Well, it is annoying, Joseph.

254
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:52,922
Just say what you want to say, please.

255
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:55,892
This is about me
understanding... like, what is this?

256
00:16:55,894 --> 00:16:57,460
Where do I stand?

257
00:16:57,462 --> 00:16:58,960
Can you look at me, please?

258
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:05,934
I get it, you're an upstanding
member of the Monterey community.

259
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:07,236
This is not compatible.

260
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:08,870
But, you know, fuck convention.

261
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:11,606
Like, let's do this.
Let's throw it all away.

262
00:17:11,608 --> 00:17:13,708
I know you have feelings for me.

263
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,744
Well, then if you know
that, just cling to that.

264
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:17,845
I have to go back.

265
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:19,580
Can you please take me back?

266
00:17:19,582 --> 00:17:21,349
That you're this uncomfortable
with the conversation...

267
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:23,284
Of course I'm uncomfortable!

268
00:17:23,286 --> 00:17:24,485
I cheated on my husband.

269
00:17:24,487 --> 00:17:26,320
I cheated on my wife!

270
00:17:26,322 --> 00:17:27,688
Why come back?

271
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,157
Why get so involved with the theater?

272
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:30,624
Because I thought you
and I were over with.

273
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:32,659
We were buried. It
was over, it was done.

274
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:33,927
I don't believe you.

275
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,529
You come into my office all the time.

276
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:37,764
You're sitting on my desk.
Like, what are you doing?

277
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:38,932
Are you playing me?

278
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,134
You know it's not over.

279
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:43,002
You can't look at me
'cause you know it's true.

280
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:44,538
Can you take me back, please?

281
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,808
For... God's sakes.

282
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:55,114
Like, how do you...

283
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,782
how do you brush it all off?

284
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,017
Like it's like nothing's happening.

285
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:01,954
I get you don't want to have feelings.

286
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,922
Right? You've got a family.

287
00:18:03,924 --> 00:18:06,024
But you kissed me back
at the theater and...

288
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,905
It's possible you're concussed,

289
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:59,541
but I don't think so.

290
00:18:59,543 --> 00:19:01,876
You have any headache?
You feel sleepy or groggy?

291
00:19:01,878 --> 00:19:03,411
- No.
- Are you sure?

292
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:05,514
- Mm-hmm.
- We can do a CAT scan if you want...

293
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:07,982
I'm not going to expose
myself to unnecessary radiation

294
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:09,151
just to keep your premiums down.

295
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:10,218
- I'm sorry.
- Honey...

296
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,353
I'm fine.

297
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:12,987
I didn't even hit my head.

298
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:15,523
What about Joseph? Is Joseph all right?

299
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:18,159
He's stable. His family is with him now.

300
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:19,460
- Okay.
- Okay.

301
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:21,995
Dr. Howard, radiology.

302
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:24,231
He is concussed and had a pneumothorax.

303
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:26,300
He remarkably had no broken bones.

304
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:28,902
- Pneumothorax?
- That's a collapsed lung.

305
00:19:28,904 --> 00:19:30,471
He's in recovery right now.

306
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:31,971
We'll bring him down to
the ICU in a couple of hours

307
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:33,306
and you can visit him there.

308
00:19:35,177 --> 00:19:36,376
Your husband will be fine.

309
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:37,443
Thank you.

310
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:39,979
What happened?

311
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:41,113
I don't know.

312
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:43,516
This kid out of nowhere ran a stop sign.

313
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:44,917
I didn't see him coming.

314
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:46,352
I don't think Joseph did either.

315
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:47,320
Mom?

316
00:19:47,322 --> 00:19:48,820
- Hey.
- Are you okay?

317
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:51,657
Hi. I'm fine, honey.
How did you get here?

318
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,931
A lot of people were talking
about exactly why Joseph Bachman

319
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:02,401
and Madeline Mackenzie
were in that car together.

320
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:05,236
I'm sure it had something to
do with artistic expression.

321
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,970
Sorry I couldn't make
it to the hospital.

322
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:10,140
She's a little shaken up,
but she's gonna be fine.

323
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,109
Joseph's gonna be fine, too.

324
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:14,044
Geez. What about the guy in the truck?

325
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,680
It wasn't a guy. It was a teenage boy.

326
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,381
They think he was texting.

327
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,749
I've got to sit down to dinner

328
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,984
with Perry and the kids right now, so...

329
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,552
why don't you give her a call?

330
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,853
She's at home. She'd
love to hear from you.

331
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:24,854
I will.

332
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,756
- Have a good night.
- Bye.

333
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,525
Was she wearing her seat belt?

334
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,992
Oh, yeah, I'm sure she was.

335
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:31,961
It would be very
dangerous if she wasn't.

336
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,631
Who's he?

337
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,666
He's just an interior decorator,

338
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,401
so he picks out furniture
and stuff for homes.

339
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:41,737
I was thinking we could
get some new furniture.

340
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:43,872
What's wrong with our furniture?

341
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:47,142
Nothing, but it would be fun, right?

342
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:48,877
Change it up a little.

343
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:50,246
What should we make for dinner?

344
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:53,014
Come on, eat up.

345
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:55,718
You haven't even eaten anything.

346
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,552
Perry. Perry.

347
00:20:57,554 --> 00:20:58,686
Hey!

348
00:20:58,688 --> 00:20:59,954
Toys down, food up.

349
00:20:59,956 --> 00:21:01,188
Hop to.

350
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:10,465
Teenagers are bad.

351
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:12,199
Do we have to be teenagers?

352
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:15,469
Yeah, yeah, I'm afraid you do.

353
00:21:15,471 --> 00:21:17,537
I'm gonna skip that part.

354
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:19,439
- What?
- Teenagers aren't that bad.

355
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:22,142
In fact, once you're a teenager,

356
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:25,379
you will only wanna hang
out with other teenagers.

357
00:21:25,381 --> 00:21:27,247
You'll think all grownups are bad.

358
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:29,316
Teenagers think you're bad?

359
00:21:29,318 --> 00:21:30,583
Oh, yeah.

360
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:32,117
They do?

361
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,486
Absolutely.

362
00:21:33,488 --> 00:21:35,154
Especially when I use my...

363
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:37,790
...burping superpower, they do.

364
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:40,660
Perry, come on.

365
00:21:42,096 --> 00:21:44,630
Or when I speak with my...

366
00:21:44,632 --> 00:21:46,699
special voice.

367
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:50,468
Because then they know...

368
00:21:51,538 --> 00:21:53,738
that here comes...

369
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,575
- the monster!
- Oh! Okay.

370
00:21:57,577 --> 00:21:59,911
Ooh, I'm starving!

371
00:21:59,913 --> 00:22:02,280

372
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:04,182
- Come on, you haven't eaten anything.
- ...devour!

373
00:22:10,723 --> 00:22:13,590
Ow! No, no, no. No, no!

374
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:14,625
Come on, get her!

375

I'll save you, honey.

00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:21,397
- No, stop! No!
- I'll save you.

379
00:22:25,837 --> 00:22:27,737
How are we doing? Any headaches?

380
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,140
No. You're sweet to worry, honey,

381
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,876
but you don't need to check
on me every five minutes.

I'm fine.

Well, I was with Jane

we were just gonna drive

His home life, his background,

451
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,315
anything you think we should
know that might be relevant?

452
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,313
I understand Ziggy's father's not involved
in his upbringing. Is that right?

453
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:29,254
The only thing I know about Ziggy's father

454
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:32,256
is that he's keen on erotic
asphyxiation and raping women.

455
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:35,292
You did not say that.

456
00:27:35,294 --> 00:27:38,295
No, of course I didn't, but I wanted to.

457
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:40,464
Can you imagine if the
people in this town found out

458
00:27:40,466 --> 00:27:43,935
that Ziggy wasn't a product
of consensual, loving sex,

459
00:27:43,937 --> 00:27:45,235
but a product of rape?

460
00:27:45,237 --> 00:27:46,703
It'd be the worst.

461
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:48,338
Every time someone asks
me about Ziggy's dad,

462
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,107
I'm terrified they're
going to expose me.

- Mr. and Mrs. Klein are here.
- No.

466
00:27:56,749 --> 00:27:58,882

the same topic, I assume.

00:28:31,848 --> 00:28:33,114
How about... Jean, get us some...

482
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:34,615
- Sure.
- ...some coffee, please?

483
00:28:34,617 --> 00:28:39,352
I don't... I don't want refreshments.

484
00:28:39,354 --> 00:28:41,889
I want you to make your son

485
00:28:41,891 --> 00:28:44,324
stop abusing my girl.

486
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:48,862
She's a fake bitch.

487
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:52,732
You're too nice.

488
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:54,033
So, what was the upshot?

489
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:57,103
They're gonna hire a teacher's aide

490
00:28:57,105 --> 00:29:00,006
whose specific job will be
watching Ziggy and Amabella.

491
00:29:00,008 --> 00:29:01,273
- Are you kidding me?
- Mm-mm.

492
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:02,508
That's ridiculous.

493
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,077
Maybe not. I mean, what if she's right?

494
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,312
I'm sorry, but Renata
Klein cannot be right.

495
00:29:06,314 --> 00:29:08,380
Ziggy could be marked with
his dad's genetic stain.

496
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:10,348
And if I did everything
properly as a mother,

497
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,283
it wouldn't matter and he
wouldn't be behaving this way.

498
00:29:12,285 --> 00:29:14,586
I just feel like you have
such great instincts as a mom.

499
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,922
Did you ever feel
like something was off?

500
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:19,925
When he was born, he
didn't just come out crying

501
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:22,127
like most kids do.

502
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:24,096
His whole body was shaking.

503
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:27,664
It was like he was so upset to be born.

504
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:31,035
And all I could do was
look at him and say...

505
00:29:31,037 --> 00:29:33,637
"I'm so sorry, little baby.

506
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:35,706
I'm so, so sorry."

507
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:44,447
I always thought that
seeing his little red face

508
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,382
would wipe away the
dirty memory, you know?

509
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,817
- But...
- Hey, girls.

510
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,019
- Hey, Tom.
- Can I get you anything else?

511
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,420
I would love some more tea.

512
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:52,756
- Sure.
- Thank you.

513
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:54,758
- Jane?
- No, thank you.

514
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,261
Saxon Baker?

515
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:00,996
- Never heard of him.
- We have a Mr. Barker at school,

516
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:03,932
but his first name is
not Saxon, it's Ted.

517
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:24,285
Hello. Please
leave a message after the tone.

518
00:30:25,855 --> 00:30:28,990
Celeste, we can't let
Jane go on that trip.

519
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:31,525
I don't know, we have to
steal her car or something.

520
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:33,594
At first, I thought she wanted closure.

521
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:35,461
Now I think she wants revenge.

522
00:30:35,463 --> 00:30:37,463
Call me.

523
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:43,203
I'm so sorry. I feel like
you were driving less aware...

524
00:30:43,205 --> 00:30:46,306
I'm here 'cause some
kid ran a stop sign.

525
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:53,879
I think I owe you some clarity.

526
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:57,283
Like you said, I kissed
you back the other day.

527
00:30:57,285 --> 00:31:01,120
And maybe I wanted to feel
all those things again,

528
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:02,754
this thing that we had.

529
00:31:06,593 --> 00:31:07,960
Was it just sex between us?

530
00:31:07,962 --> 00:31:09,694
Of course it wasn't.

531
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:15,633
But the other day, I
started to feel afraid.

532
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,770
I've had this paralyzing fear...

533
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:23,842
that what happened
between us is gonna get out

534
00:31:23,844 --> 00:31:25,509
and it's gonna ruin my family.

535
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:28,645
It's probably best if...
if you beg out of the play.

536
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:32,782
I mean, most of the work
is done now anyway, so...

537
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:35,886
- Yeah, of course.
- We should be fine.

538
00:31:35,888 --> 00:31:37,120
Yeah, you should.

539
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:39,489
- Madeline.
- Oh, hi.

540
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:41,391
- Hi, Tori.
- Hi.

541
00:31:41,393 --> 00:31:44,060
- How are you?
- Better.

542
00:31:44,062 --> 00:31:46,662
I think we're all doing
better. How are you feeling?

543
00:31:46,664 --> 00:31:49,232
Actually, I normally have
a lot of lower back pain,

544
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:52,902
so probably saved me a trip
to the chiropractor.

545
00:31:52,904 --> 00:31:55,637
But I... I just stopped by
to see if Joseph was okay.

546
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:58,741
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.

547
00:31:58,743 --> 00:32:00,675
Thanks.

548
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:02,277
I'm just gonna head out now.

549
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,512
- Okay.
- But good to see you, Tori.

550
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:06,147
- Yeah, you, too.
- Yeah.

551
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:08,416
Bye.

552
00:32:15,525 --> 00:32:17,091
Nice of her to drop by.

553
00:32:58,432 --> 00:33:00,532
He's in Chicago.

554
00:33:00,534 --> 00:33:02,134
He left this morning,

555
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:05,404
so I just... I decided
to come in by myself.

556
00:33:07,207 --> 00:33:09,073
Okay.

557
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:13,344
It was Perry's idea to come
in in the first place, so...

558
00:33:13,346 --> 00:33:16,880
I mean, I think that's
a very healthy sign.

559
00:33:18,818 --> 00:33:21,552
Don't you think that's positive,
that he would want to come in?

560
00:33:23,122 --> 00:33:24,955
Why did he want to come in?

561
00:33:24,957 --> 00:33:27,590
Well, because, we're...

562
00:33:27,592 --> 00:33:29,659
just for the same, um...

563
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:35,031
He's trouble... uh, we're both troubled,

564
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:39,002
that... that the lovemaking
is tied up in, um...

565
00:33:40,372 --> 00:33:41,737
in anger.

566
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:45,407
Why did you want to come in today?

567
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,116
I don't know.

568
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:57,319
Something happened?

569
00:33:59,189 --> 00:34:00,921
Um...

570
00:34:04,861 --> 00:34:07,362
Oh, just the usual, you know.

571
00:34:07,364 --> 00:34:11,532
Um, when he left this
morning, we made love.

572
00:34:22,844 --> 00:34:25,379
It's as if our, um...

573
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:30,884
It's as if we turn
each other on by rage.

574
00:34:30,886 --> 00:34:32,119
Hmm.

575
00:34:34,522 --> 00:34:37,523
And that's a problem, I think.

576
00:34:39,927 --> 00:34:43,162
Do you think that's a problem?

577
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,532
Well, I'm encouraged that you at
least think of it as lovemaking.

578
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:49,368
Because sex isn't always that.

579
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:56,307
Does the sex you have with
Perry ever strike you as violent?

580
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:04,049
No.

581
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:07,217
Are you ever left with bruises?

582
00:35:09,488 --> 00:35:12,156
Um, maybe.

583
00:35:12,158 --> 00:35:16,393
I mean, I... I don't really remember.

584
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:21,565
Have you ever sustained bruises
from something other than sex?

585
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,536
I don't follow.

586
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,875
Your husband said he grabbed
you too hard sometimes.

587
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:35,545
Has he ever left a mark
on you by grabbing you?

588
00:35:37,115 --> 00:35:39,748
Oh, um, I mean...

589
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:45,120
we have a very volatile
relationship, and I...

590
00:35:46,923 --> 00:35:48,790
I've left the occasional mark on him.

591
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:50,658
- I...
- By hitting?

592
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,859
Yeah.

593
00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:53,361
Really?

594
00:35:53,363 --> 00:35:55,597
Hitting him first or hitting him back?

595
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:02,269
I have to say I'm beginning
to feel a bit uncomfortable

596
00:36:02,271 --> 00:36:03,870
because this is, um...

597
00:36:05,274 --> 00:36:07,575
I think this is
unethical, truth be told.

598
00:36:07,577 --> 00:36:08,809
How... how so?

599
00:36:10,446 --> 00:36:13,581
Because you're treating us.

600
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:15,082
And only you showed up,

601
00:36:15,084 --> 00:36:18,251
so I'm treating half the couple.

602
00:36:18,253 --> 00:36:19,885
From what I know about
your duty of care,

603
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:23,623
you are ethically responsible...

604
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:25,492
I throw off the ethical chains

605
00:36:25,494 --> 00:36:28,661
when I sense a patient in danger.

606
00:36:28,663 --> 00:36:30,763
What?

607
00:36:34,368 --> 00:36:35,934
He hurts you.

608
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:39,037
Oh, no.

609
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,973
I... no, I didn't... I mean,
I didn't... I didn't say that.

610
00:36:41,975 --> 00:36:43,808
He's... I mean...

611
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,012
I pick up on things, not just from you,

612
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:48,280
but from Perry.

613
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,355
We both become violent sometimes.

614
00:37:00,193 --> 00:37:02,426
I take my share of the blame.

615
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,727
I'm...

616
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,863
He hurts you.

617
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,702
Look...

618
00:37:15,707 --> 00:37:17,807
I'm not a victim here.

619
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:19,509
I'm not.

620
00:37:19,511 --> 00:37:20,810
I hit him.

621
00:37:22,147 --> 00:37:23,812
I throw things at him.

622
00:37:23,814 --> 00:37:25,047
I'm...

623
00:37:27,818 --> 00:37:29,218
What are you looking
for from me, Celeste?

624
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,853
Help. Help, that's what I want.

625
00:37:31,855 --> 00:37:35,257
I mean, we both acknowledge
that this relationship is toxic.

626
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:38,194
We... that's why we made
the appointment to come in,

627
00:37:38,196 --> 00:37:41,362
because we... we know that.

628
00:37:41,364 --> 00:37:43,498
We know it and we want to, um...

629
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,267
we... we want to learn
techniques, strategies,

630
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:47,702
that's what we want, to make him...

631
00:37:47,704 --> 00:37:49,571
- Him stop.
- To...

632
00:37:49,573 --> 00:37:51,906
To make us... us stop.

633
00:37:53,343 --> 00:37:55,210
So...

634
00:37:55,212 --> 00:37:57,044
Are you physically afraid of him?

635
00:37:58,514 --> 00:38:00,914
This feels very wrong, I have to say.

636
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:04,017
I can't... I mean...

637
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:07,387
Um, you're meant to be our doctor.

638
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:09,556
You're treating us.

639
00:38:09,558 --> 00:38:11,791
And you are demonizing him.

640
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:13,527

Hey. I was just thinking about you.

651
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,410
How you feeling? Still no headache?

652
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:08,778
Oh, no, I'm fine.

653
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,179
You're sweet to worry.

654
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,481
I do worry.

655
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:13,349
I was just sitting here thinking about

656
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,719
how much you've done for me
since I moved to Monterey.

657
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,354
I read a quote once that said...

658
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,291
"Friendships are the
masterpieces of nature."

659
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,093
I know it's cheesy, but...

660
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:27,162
you're totally my masterpiece.

661
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:30,865
And you're one of the greatest
people I've ever met, Madeline.

662
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:33,835
If you only knew how much
that meant to me right now.

663
00:39:33,837 --> 00:39:35,904
Can I ask you a big favor?

664
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:39,907
Um, would you mind picking
Ziggy up at pick-up?

665
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:41,575
I... I just have so much work to do

666
00:39:41,577 --> 00:39:43,611
and I could use a few
extra hours to catch up.

667
00:39:43,613 --> 00:39:45,212
Yeah, no problem.

668
00:39:45,214 --> 00:39:46,747
Oh, thank you so much.

669
00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:47,981
I'll call the school and let them know.

670
00:39:47,983 --> 00:39:49,583
Ziggy's all mine, honey.

671
00:39:49,585 --> 00:39:50,718
Thanks, Madeline.

672
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,687
- Bye.
- Bye.

673
00:40:00,962 --> 00:40:02,562
Jane Chapman?

674
00:40:02,564 --> 00:40:04,364
She's insane, too.

Does he ever hurt the children?

680
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,358
No!

681
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,826
God, no.

682
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:37,328
He would never hurt the children.

683
00:40:38,631 --> 00:40:41,098
This is... he's a wonderful father.

684
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,667
I mean, he's the best. The best.

685
00:40:42,669 --> 00:40:44,736
I couldn't think of
a better one, really.

686
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:48,705
It's one of the reasons that I...

687
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:50,306
The reason you don't leave him?

688
00:40:50,308 --> 00:40:52,609
- There are other reasons.
- Okay. Such as?

689
00:40:52,611 --> 00:40:55,111
I'm madly in love with him.

690
00:40:55,113 --> 00:40:56,312
He adores me.

691
00:40:56,314 --> 00:40:58,815
He... he treats me like a goddess.

692
00:40:58,817 --> 00:41:00,851
When he's not hurting you.

693
00:41:00,853 --> 00:41:04,320
Look, he's a great father.

694
00:41:04,322 --> 00:41:07,189
We have great sex.

695
00:41:07,191 --> 00:41:09,625
We make each other laugh.

696
00:41:09,627 --> 00:41:13,896
We're... there's violence,
yes, in the relationship,

697
00:41:13,898 --> 00:41:15,264
and that's why we came in.

698
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:17,366
And it's an issue, but, I mean...

699
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,637
all marriages are complicated.

700
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:24,873
You think violence is
normal in a relationship?

701
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:27,041
No!

702
00:41:28,011 --> 00:41:30,812
My apologies. I misread.

703
00:41:30,814 --> 00:41:32,514
When this violence occurs,

704
00:41:32,516 --> 00:41:34,916
have you ever been afraid you might die?

705
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:40,521
Never.

706
00:41:40,523 --> 00:41:42,656
Never?

707
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,805
That must have been terrifying.

708
00:42:00,508 --> 00:42:02,975
Did you think of leaving him then?

709
00:42:04,245 --> 00:42:07,346
I've thought of leaving him many times.

710
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:13,117
But then I think about what we have,

711
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,519
and we have a lot.

712
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:17,288
Are there any weapons in your house?

713
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,692
No. No, it's not like that.

714
00:42:20,694 --> 00:42:22,761
No.

715
00:42:22,763 --> 00:42:25,330
I mean, the boys have some lightsabers.

716
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:29,667
Listen, you see a lot of couples

717
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:32,970
- that have bad problems.
- Mm-hmm.

718
00:42:32,972 --> 00:42:36,740
And after a while, maybe
that's all you can see.

719
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:39,877
Do you ever pause to consider
what is great in a marriage,

720
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:41,545
what is profoundly right?

721
00:42:41,547 --> 00:42:42,746
I do.

722
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,683
Tell me, what is most...

723
00:42:45,685 --> 00:42:47,784
profoundly right about yours?

724
00:42:47,786 --> 00:42:50,252
We've been through so much together.

725
00:42:50,254 --> 00:42:52,889
I had a really tough
time getting pregnant.

726
00:42:52,891 --> 00:42:54,457
And... and...

727
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:57,460
- I had four miscarriages.
- Mm-hmm.

728
00:42:57,462 --> 00:43:00,029
And when the twins
were born, they were...

729
00:43:00,031 --> 00:43:03,332
they were born really early.

730
00:43:03,334 --> 00:43:06,635
And they were in the hospital
for a long time, and that was...

731
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,907
It was tough.

732
00:43:11,909 --> 00:43:15,878
And he was there by my
side every step of the way.

733
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,881
- He never... he was so good.
- I see.

734
00:43:18,883 --> 00:43:21,983
No, honestly, I don't think
you do see, because this is...

735
00:43:21,985 --> 00:43:23,350
this is...

736
00:43:24,487 --> 00:43:26,086
It's special, you know?

737
00:43:26,088 --> 00:43:29,323
We're bound by everything
we've been through.

738
00:43:29,325 --> 00:43:31,626
And the idea of breaking away from him,

739
00:43:31,628 --> 00:43:35,295
it's like tearing flesh.

740
00:43:36,966 --> 00:43:40,233
How do you think the
abuse impacts on your sons?

741
00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:42,536
It doesn't impact on my sons.

742
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:44,504
I'm telling you, I...

743
00:43:44,506 --> 00:43:46,339
None of this affects them.

744
00:43:46,341 --> 00:43:47,807
We never fight in front of them.

745
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:49,609
They never see anything. They're fine.

746
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:51,077
They live in a happy household.

747
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:52,812
They have no idea.

748
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,083
- He will hit you again.
- Yeah.

749
00:43:58,085 --> 00:44:00,786
- Yeah.
- Yeah. And I'll hit him again.

750
00:44:00,788 --> 00:44:03,022
And eventually, the boys will know.

751
00:44:03,024 --> 00:44:05,490
- No.
- If they already don't.

752
00:44:05,492 --> 00:44:06,759
Oh...

753
00:44:06,761 --> 00:44:09,028
All right, our time is about up.

754
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:13,330
We should make an appointment
and come up with a plan.

755
00:44:14,935 --> 00:44:17,101
A plan?

756
00:44:17,103 --> 00:44:18,836
For the next time he hits you.

757
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,462
Ms. Wright.

758
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:50,466
Saxon Baker.

759
00:44:58,943 --> 00:45:00,542
Come on in.

760
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:13,187
Have a seat.

761
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:18,392
So, what are you looking for?

762
00:45:20,496 --> 00:45:21,996
It's a new project board.

763
00:45:21,998 --> 00:45:23,230
Pardon.

764
00:45:25,868 --> 00:45:27,868
Modern meets mid-century.

765
00:45:39,714 --> 00:45:41,714
Ms. Wright, this is very...

766
00:45:41,716 --> 00:45:43,415
odd.

767
00:47:42,628 --> 00:47:44,308
Fuck.

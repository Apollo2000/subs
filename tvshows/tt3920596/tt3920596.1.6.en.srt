00:03:12,078 --> 00:03:15,245
Well, but that's the
problem. He's not dead.

35
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:18,281
For all we know, he's out there
right now assaulting women.

36
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:20,751
Can I ask you, when you went
on this little road trip,

37
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:23,453
did you... did you take your gun?

38
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:28,024
- No.
- You don't sound sure.

39
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:29,325
I didn't take my gun.

40
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:31,660
And had this Saxon Baker been the guy,

what would you have done?

42
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:35,197
Were there others?

43
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,600
Other Saxons in your Internet search?

44
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:41,270
Listen, you moved to Monterey
to start over, to build a future.

45
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:44,373
I suggest you focus

I'll be back Thursday night.

Madeline's gonna be so disappointed.

56
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:27,713
It's a whole big thing.

57
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,484
I don't want you going

59

Come to Phoenix with me.

- Baby...
- I know "Come to Phoenix with me"

61
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:42,226
isn't the most romantic
thing you've ever heard.

62
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:45,697
But we can... we can sneak
off to Sedona for a night.

63
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,499
No, I can't do that.

64
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:50,401
- Why?
- Because she will never speak to me again.

65
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:53,304
- It's a big thing for her.
- Madeline is beginning to piss me off.

66
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:54,405
Oh.

67
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,943
How often do we get a chance to
sneak away, just the two of us?

68
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,612
Look what you're doing.

69
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:03,481
- Look at it.
- What? What?

70
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:05,549
You're the one who suddenly has to leave

71
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:09,353
and I am the one who disappoints.

72
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:11,421
- I'm just trying to be romantic.
- (sighs)

73

Huh?

74
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:15,959

have dinner together, or...

79
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:35,076
You know, it's okay for
things to be ugly sometimes.

That's, like, life.

Got it.

82
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:39,648
Life can be ugly.

83
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,984
I'll make a note of that. Thank you.

84
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:44,820

you been doing all day

88
00:05:54,497 --> 00:05:58,132
behind your closed
door there, locked away?

89
00:05:58,134 --> 00:06:00,334
- Working on your secret project?
- Yeah.

90
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:02,036
Well, it won't be a
secret for much longer.

91
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:04,370
My official unveiling is on Wednesday.

92
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:05,639
Wow!

93
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:07,373
You've been working really hard on this.

94
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,543
Well, colleges look for
passion projects now, you know.

95
00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:13,179
It's not just about, like, your
GPA and being captain of volleyball.

96
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:15,715
- Finally.
- Yeah.

97

<i>(wind chimes tinkling)</i>

98
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,187
I wanted to say thank you for
having the dinner on Tuesday.

99
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:24,389
I know you and Mom
don't really get along

100
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:26,291
or, you know, necessarily want to,

101
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:30,362
but the idea that we can all be
together sometimes like we used to...

102
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:32,798
is kind of cool.

103
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,174
- Night.
- Bonnie:<i> Good night, sweetie.</i>

104

Don't. Just cut.

up a giant can of violent worms.</i>

106
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,926
- So, how did you leave it with her?
- <i>Well, I tried to diffuse her.</i>

107
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:04,828
<i>Imagine me playing the role of diffuser.</i>

108
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,598
<i>I should just stay out
of other people's lives.</i>

109
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,066
I'll talk to her.

110
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:11,701
- <i>What could you possibly say?</i>
- Excuse me?

111
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:13,769
Well, I mean, she can
hardly relate to my life.

112
00:07:13,771 --> 00:07:15,671
What on earth is she gonna
do to identify with yours,

113
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:17,406
which is just a tick north of perfect?

114
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:20,242
(sighs) My life isn't perfect, Madeline.

115
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:22,311
Bad things have happened to me.

116
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:24,246
I do understand the concept.

117
00:07:24,248 --> 00:07:26,115
- <i>I'm sorry. I offended you.</i>
- (exhales)

118
00:07:26,117 --> 00:07:28,517
<i>I can hear it in your voice.
Just tell me to go fuck myself.</i>

119
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:31,219
No, I'm not gonna do that.

120
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:34,923
I just don't think
she's a dangerous person.

121

<i>Really? I'm starting to
get a little bit worried.</i>

- I signed it.

158
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:17,252
- I accidentally signed it.
- The school was not doing nothing.

159
00:09:17,254 --> 00:09:19,154
Ms. Barnes: The petition
we will get squashed.

160
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:20,989
I am more concerned...

161
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:24,193
some of the children
have been instructed

162
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:25,694
(voices fades) not to play with Ziggy.

163
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:27,696
<i>(electricity humming)</i>

164
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:36,938
(kids chattering)

165
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:44,712
- Are you behind this petition?
- Excuse me?

166
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:46,379
- I asked you a fucking question.
- Gordon: Hey, whoa, whoa.

167
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:47,848
- Calm down.
- Don't fucking threaten me.

168
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,816
- Was it you?
- What are you gonna do, huh?

169
00:09:49,818 --> 00:09:51,184
Choke me? (scoffs)

170
00:09:51,186 --> 00:09:52,552
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!
- Excuse me!

171
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:54,320
- Don't you...!
- Stop, stop!

172
00:09:54,322 --> 00:09:57,958
- Ow! Oh, my God, my eye!
- What the hell is wrong with you?!

173
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,860
If they had any sense,
they would've canceled

174
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:01,261
Trivia Night right then and there.

175
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:03,262
I had actually planned
on skipping Trivia Night

176
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:04,429
until the eye gouging.

177
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:07,332
I should've taken that job in Reykjavik.

178
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:08,834
I'm gonna sue you!

179
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:11,237
- Ugh.
- Is her eye okay?

180
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,838
Apparently. (scoffs)

181
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,273
She'll be fine.

182
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:16,708
I need to get out of this
town as soon as possible.

183
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,043
Hold on a second.

184
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:19,844
Ziggy is very well-liked.

185
00:10:19,846 --> 00:10:21,813
Chloe says he's popular.

186
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:23,748
Even Amabella plays with him.

187
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,383
This is about the parents,

188
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:28,853
and I'm not gonna have you
bulldozed out of Monterey.

189
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:31,256
- Neither will I, for what it's worth.
- Exactly.

190
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:33,491
- Thank you.
- (chuckles) Thank you.

191
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,626
Thanks.

192
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:40,463
A lot of parents are probably
applauding you right now.

193
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:43,167
There's more than one person in this
town that wants to deck Renata Klein,

194
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:44,802
yours truly included.

195
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:47,037
I actually think this is a good thing.

196
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,940
It's high time that people know they
shouldn't fuck with Jane Chapman.

197
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,342
And they're not gonna
mess with your kid either.

198
00:10:52,344 --> 00:10:54,177
I had my gun.

199
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:55,111
What?

200
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,579
I had my gun in my purse

201
00:10:57,581 --> 00:10:59,415
when I went to San Luis Obispo.

202
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,184
I don't think I would've
shot him, but I had it.

203
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:02,151
(sniffles)

204
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:04,486
Okay.

205
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,324
Well, I'm not gonna lie.

206
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:10,292
That gives me pause.

207
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,927
Yeah, it gives me pause, too.

208
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,531
Like, I think I'm
going insane. (sniffles)

209
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,067
Like, I still hope

210
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:22,537
that whoever he is is a nice guy.

211
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:25,606
That, like, maybe that night
was just a bad misunderstanding,

212
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:29,643
or a night gone wrong,
or he had a bad day,

213
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,245
or his parents got in a car crash.

214
00:11:31,247 --> 00:11:33,380
I, like, make up these crazy excuses

215
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:37,852
because I'm so desperate to believe that
Ziggy's father is actually a good person.

216
00:11:47,295 --> 00:11:50,629
<i>(Celeste exhales)
Well, he's been very, um...</i>

217
00:11:51,632 --> 00:11:53,900
(sucks teeth) affectionate.

218
00:11:53,902 --> 00:11:57,070
Very clingy.

219
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:59,472
Which usually means
he's feeling insecure.

220
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:01,740
Or, um...

221
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,476
Or what?

222
00:12:04,478 --> 00:12:06,211
Or it means I have the power.

223
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:10,815
Sometimes he has it,
sometimes I have it.

224
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,717
It's like a seesaw.

225
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:16,922
When do you get the power?

226
00:12:18,024 --> 00:12:19,357
After he hits you?

227
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:24,996
Yeah. When he hurts me,
I get the upper hand.

228
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,267
The more he hurts me, the higher I go,

229
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:31,068
the longer I stay, until...

230
00:12:35,374 --> 00:12:37,840
He's been, um... (clears throat)

231
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,842
very loving... (chuckles)

232
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:41,211
the last few days.

233
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:44,281
But at some point, he
gets the power back.

234
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:48,285
Mm. Usually when...

235
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:51,388
when my bruises fade and...

236
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:55,124
and he doesn't feel as guilty,

237
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:56,725
he feels insecure.

238
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,794
And then it all happens again.

239
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:00,229
Where is he now?

240
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:03,532
He's in Phoenix. He left this morning.

241
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:11,205
When are you gonna leave him, Celeste?

242
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,440
(scoffs)

243
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:14,909
When he hurts you badly enough?

244
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:17,611
<i>When...</i> he hurts the children?

245
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:21,916
- He will never hurt the children...
- You need to rent an apartment.

246
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:23,985
Locally,

247
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:26,386
if you don't want to
disrupt the boys' school.

248
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,720
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

249
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:29,957
We're getting way
ahead of ourselves here.

250
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,758
No, I don't think so.

251
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,127
Stock the refrigerator.

252
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:35,862
Make sure the utilities are paid for.

253
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:37,965
Have the beds set up for the kids.

254
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:42,469
Get it all ready so
we can at least remove

255
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:44,770
"Where on God's earth would
I go?" from the equation.

256
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:46,505
You'll have a place,

257
00:13:46,507 --> 00:13:49,408
a mindset, another life standing by

258
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,344
should you need it.

259
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:52,778
Which...

260
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,380
we both know you will.

261
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:58,050
I don't think a therapist
should be this, um...

262
00:13:58,052 --> 00:14:00,618
I don't think you should
be behaving like this.

263
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,988
I'll get you the number of the Better
Business Bureau and you can report me.

264
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,424
In the meantime, start
documenting the abuse.

265
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:08,926
Write everything down.

266
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:12,263
Photograph your injuries.
Keep doctor reports.

267
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:15,233
That could be important
in a custody battle.

268
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:18,068
And men like your husband
typically do go for custody.

269
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,473
He has the resources,
the money, the contacts.

270
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:24,274
Most importantly...

271
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:29,346
he has the ego to see this through.

272
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:32,416
I don't understand why you're
being such an alarmist right now...

273
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:34,850
Because I'm alarmed.

274
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:40,723
Have you told anybody
else about the abuse?

275
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,193
No.

276
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:46,062
- Why not?
- I don't know.

277
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:48,064
If you were to guess.

278
00:14:51,301 --> 00:14:52,734
(scoffs)

279
00:14:54,371 --> 00:14:56,104
Perhaps my self-worth

280
00:14:56,106 --> 00:14:59,574
is made up of how other people see me.

281
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:01,876
(chuckles)

282
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:05,080
I'm sorry. I... I'm just amazed

283
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:09,050
by patients who can harbor
such profound self-awareness

284
00:15:09,052 --> 00:15:11,552
underneath the hard shell of denial.

285
00:15:11,554 --> 00:15:13,287
Find a friend to confide in.

286
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:15,189
Do it today.

287
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:16,424
(sighs) Because?

288
00:15:16,426 --> 00:15:18,392
Because if there is a custody battle,

289
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:20,561
you know what Perry's
lawyer will be asking...

290
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:24,365
"Did you ever tell anybody, Mrs. Wright?

291
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:26,266
Hmm?

292
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:28,501
Really? You told nobody at all?

293
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:30,870
Is that because it
never really happened?

294
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:34,207
And you're just making
all this up to win custody?

295
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:37,810
In fact, you've repeatedly maintained

296
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:41,114
what a wonderful husband
and father Perry is.

297
00:15:41,116 --> 00:15:43,549
Haven't you, Mrs. Wright?

298
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:48,187
Nobody's ever witnessed
this alleged abuse, ever.

299
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:50,089
Isn't that true, Mrs. Wright?

300
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:56,061
We only have your word.
You said he was wonderful.

301
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:58,330
Now you say he's a monster.

302
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,898
Were you lying then
or are you lying now?"

303
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:06,770
You're a lawyer.

304
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:10,108
You know how important
it is to have a witness.

305
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:15,346
- Hello.
- Hey. Juliette, right?

306
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:17,280
- Renata: What do you want?
- Do you want...

307
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:25,255
Uh...

308
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:32,496
I... I just wanted to
say that I'm so sorry.

309
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:35,631
I completely lost control
and I stepped out of line,

310
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,466
and I should have never
shoved you like that.

311
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:40,202
There's no excuses and I'm so sorry.

312
00:16:40,204 --> 00:16:41,670
Yeah.

313
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:52,447
The truth is is I finally realized

314
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:56,618
that I've been feeling exactly
what you must be feeling.

315
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,021
There's nothing worse than your
child being victimized, right?

316
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:05,193
So, I understand and
completely empathize

317
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:07,294
with what you're going through.

318
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:11,931
I am as sure as any parent
can be that Ziggy is innocent.

319
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:14,734
I took him to a child
psychologist and she examined him

320
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:18,071
and tested him and said that
he was a gentle young boy

321
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:21,542
who's completely incapable of
doing what he's been accused of.

322
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:25,378
Renata, I am at my wit's end.

323
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,746
I don't know what to do anymore.

324
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:30,349
Does Amabella still say
that he's hurting her?

325
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:34,687
No. She, uh...

326
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:37,190
says he's a sweet boy.

327
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:39,192
And orientation?

328
00:17:39,194 --> 00:17:44,062
Well, she hasn't taken
back the accusation, but...

329
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:47,632
she refuses to talk to
us about anything further.

330
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:52,470
You think you're at your wit's end.

331
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,706
My daughter is the one getting hurt

332
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,575
and I can't stop it.

333
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,910
(softly) I'm so sorry.

334
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,747
Me, too.

335
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,388
Thank you.

336
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,856
Thank you.

337
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,461
Yeah, my baby lost another baby tooth.

338
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,963
- I put it under my pillow.
- Good.

339
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:24,133
There is no tooth fairy,
idiot. It's Mom and Dad.

340
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:27,270
- Would you please get me a tissue?
- Is it bleeding?

341
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,938
No, not a lot.

342
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,673
(growling)

343
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:32,974
- Are there any bad teenagers in here?
- Twins: Dad!

344
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:35,477
- What are you doing here?
- (laughs) Hey, boys.

345
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,778
(twins giggling)

346
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,714
Don't we have a premiere
to attend tonight?

347
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,117
You made it back for the play?

348
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,819
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

349
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:46,388
You did that for me?

350
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,090
Yeah. Of course.

351
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:50,924
Thank you.

352
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:55,696
Wow! Kazowie!

353
00:18:55,698 --> 00:18:57,398
(laughs) Did you say "kazowie"?

354
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,168
- I did. You look fantastic.
- Thank you, honey.

355
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,738
- What, you got a big date or something?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

356
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,873
- A very big date.
- Oh.

357
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,476
- Congrats on your opening night.
- Aw.

358
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:11,478
Thank you, honey.

359
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,780
I don't really have anything
to do with it anymore.

360
00:19:13,782 --> 00:19:15,815
You have a huge amount to do with it.

361
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:19,118
It wouldn't even be happening
but for you. Are you kidding?

362
00:19:22,424 --> 00:19:24,256
- Let's go.
- Okay.

363
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:27,593
<i>(guitar playing)</i>

364
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:38,537
How do I look?

365
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:40,705
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

366
00:19:40,707 --> 00:19:42,607
Remember, you're not
allowed to sing that one.

367
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:45,343
- Okay.
- You can play it, but you can't sing it.

368
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:48,513
- Why can't I go to the play?
- It's not really for kids.

369
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:51,582
- I like puppets.
- I know you do.

370
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:54,185
Is it because the puppets have sex?

371
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:56,454
- Who told you that?
- Chloe.

372
00:19:56,456 --> 00:20:00,791
She said the boy puppet puts
his penis in the girl puppet.

373
00:20:00,793 --> 00:20:03,527
(stammering) Chloe said that?

374
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:06,196
Yeah, it's icky.

375
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:08,164
Sometimes...

376
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,167
magic comes from icky, Ziggy.

377
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,102
- Woman:<i> Hey.</i>
- That's a longer conversation, though.

378
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:15,771
- Hi.
- How's my little champion?

379
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:17,272
- Awesome.
- Yeah?

380
00:20:17,274 --> 00:20:19,408
- You learn some more chords this week?
- Yeah.

381
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,577
Yeah, you always do. (laughs)

382
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:23,045
- Hi!
- Thank you so much.

383
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:25,614
- No problem.
- I won't be gone too long.

384
00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:28,384
- Give me a kiss.

Stop.

391
00:20:50,673 --> 00:20:52,072
Don't do that.

392
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:53,774
- What, this?
- Yeah.

393
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:55,175
I thought you liked when I did that.

394
00:20:55,177 --> 00:20:57,544
- Just, come on.
- What?

395
00:20:57,546 --> 00:20:59,413
- Get ready.
- We can be a little late.

396
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:01,782
No, we can't.

397
00:21:01,784 --> 00:21:05,118
Well, I'm just very excited to see you.

398
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,620

Yeah, you can feel that?

403
00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:20,633
God, that's quite a trick.

404
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:23,735
- It is quite a trick.
- Mm-hmm.

405

Come on, baby, please get
ready. We've got to go.

- Calm down, I just want...
- Please, this is important.

- We've got to go.
- What... hey, what is this?

408
00:21:29,777 --> 00:21:31,476
- Really, stop it.
- What's wrong?

409
00:21:31,478 --> 00:21:33,044
What did you do, take
a pill or something?

410
00:21:33,046 --> 00:21:34,880
No, of course I didn't take a pill.

00:24:14,932 --> 00:24:15,964
I would never do that.

474
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:19,768
What were you doing in his car?

475
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,770
<i>(turn signal ticking)</i>

476
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:27,842
Ed: <i>You're kind of quiet.</i>

477
00:24:27,844 --> 00:24:30,077
Oh, I'm just...

478
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,946
reflecting on all of it.

479
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:36,584
Big night. You'd think you'd be
bubbling over a bit with pride.

480
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:39,720
- You should be.
- Thanks, honey.

481
00:24:39,722 --> 00:24:41,421
I don't know, for some reason

482
00:24:41,423 --> 00:24:45,559
I'm just thinking about this
dinner with Bonnie and Nathan.

483
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:47,493
I'm just kind of dreading it.

484
00:24:47,495 --> 00:24:49,596
- It'll be fine.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

485
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:51,764
(phone buzzing)

486
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:52,966
Finally.

487
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:56,002
She better have a good reason.

488
00:24:56,004 --> 00:24:57,570
Where were you?

489
00:24:59,074 --> 00:25:00,773
What?

490
00:25:00,775 --> 00:25:03,542
- A broken urethra.
- I know!

491
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,777
- Can you even imagine?
- Wow.

492
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:07,846
Chloe, it's time to go to bed, honey.

493
00:25:07,848 --> 00:25:11,182
- Give me 10!
- No, time for bed right now.

494
00:25:11,184 --> 00:25:13,785
(vocalizing)

495
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:15,453
Chloe, now.

496
00:25:15,455 --> 00:25:17,322
Seven, final offer.

497
00:25:17,324 --> 00:25:18,690
I said now.

498
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:30,901
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night.

499
00:25:30,903 --> 00:25:32,169
- Mwah.
- Love you.

500
00:25:32,171 --> 00:25:33,738
Love you, too.

501
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,740
- Night, honeycake.
- Love you.

502
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,307
I love you, too.

503
00:25:39,945 --> 00:25:42,712
<i>(whispers) So, it...
it happened during...</i>

504
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:44,848
I mean, talk about wild sex.

505
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,684
Can you imagine being in the hospital?

506
00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:50,820
- (laughs)
- I mean, how embarrassing!

507
00:25:50,822 --> 00:25:54,223
I just can't imagine
the passion it would take

508
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:58,160
to shatter a urethra in two places.

509
00:25:58,162 --> 00:26:00,029
You sound a little envious.

510
00:26:00,031 --> 00:26:02,998
- Do you want me to smash yours?
- (laughs)

511
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,968
Well, not smash, but, you know.

512
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:11,873
- (laughs)
- Yeah, we never have wild sex.

513
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,608
I mean, we have nice sex.

514
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,443
I like it, but, you know,

515
00:26:16,445 --> 00:26:18,946
it usually times out
between four and six minutes,

516
00:26:18,948 --> 00:26:22,817
and neither of us are in any
remote danger of physical injury.

517
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,686
- Well, that's just kind of mean, Ed.
- Sorry.

518
00:26:24,688 --> 00:26:27,922
I mean, maybe I am envious, you know?

519
00:26:27,924 --> 00:26:32,759
I mean, what, Perry walks
through the door and, whoosh!

520
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:34,761
I wish we had that kind of desire.

521
00:26:34,763 --> 00:26:37,097
Well, by "we" you mean me.

522
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:39,900
Okay, you're a fiery person.

523
00:26:41,937 --> 00:26:45,638
Which makes your tepidness for me

524
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,907
just more conspicuous.

525
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,310
I don't mean to punish you...

526
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:53,012
Well, I mean, it feels like you are.

527
00:26:53,014 --> 00:26:56,348
I tell myself all the time,
like, married people, you know,

528
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,818
after a while they reach this...

529
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,553
sexual plateau, and that's the norm.

530
00:27:03,223 --> 00:27:05,656
Then I hear about
other couples, you know,

531
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:07,992
breaking urethras, and...

532
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:10,962
Well, it's hardly like you're
some sort of raging bull, Ed.

533
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:14,132
The only time you touch me is when you're
reaching across me to get the Visine for...

534
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:17,001
That's because you
don't want it, Madeline.

535
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:19,503
We never talk about that
because that would make it

536
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:22,272
harder to pretend.

537
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:26,110
And sometimes that's the... the
essence of a happy marriage, isn't it?

538
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:28,245
The ability to pretend.

539
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,932
In the days leading up to Trivia Night,

540
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,969
it just seemed more and more
people wanted to kill each other.

541
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,435
It was hard to keep track.

00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:28,334

said that Ed was rehearsing.

But friction between Ed and I is fine.

00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,766
First of all, I'm very
disappointed in your attitude.

571
00:29:01,768 --> 00:29:05,136
And second, and more importantly,

572
00:29:05,138 --> 00:29:07,471
we have a bigger problem.

573
00:29:07,473 --> 00:29:10,341
Abigail's secret project.

574
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:12,343
Yeah? What about it?

575
00:29:13,947 --> 00:29:16,714
She is auctioning off her
virginity on the Internet.

576
00:29:18,351 --> 00:29:21,017
For Amnesty International, so
it is for a very good cause.

577
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:24,254
(clears throat) She's selling
her virginity on the Internet?

578
00:29:25,824 --> 00:29:26,990
Good cause?

579
00:29:30,162 --> 00:29:32,095
Nathan: <i>Abigail!</i>

580
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:36,098
You smoking?

581
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,766
Just for tonight.

582
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:43,839
It's been 15 years. Why not?

583
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:57,585
So, you think our marriage is pretend?

584
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,421
No, I said that in every marriage

585
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,357
there is pretending.

586
00:30:04,394 --> 00:30:06,460
Even the best ones.

587
00:30:07,898 --> 00:30:11,531
You said it was the essence,
if I heard you correctly.

588
00:30:12,868 --> 00:30:15,602
I mean, I don't pretend to love you.

589
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:17,804
I know you don't pretend to love me.

590
00:30:19,074 --> 00:30:23,443
But what I do like
to pretend, as do you,

591
00:30:23,445 --> 00:30:26,446
is that I'm all that.

592
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:30,283
So, is this back to the
"Steady Eddie" theme?

593
00:30:30,285 --> 00:30:32,318
- Okay.
- Is that what we're talking about?

594
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,954
No, Madeline, I'm the lucky one.

595
00:30:34,956 --> 00:30:40,092
I get to wake up every day
next to the girl of my dreams.

596
00:30:40,094 --> 00:30:42,694
That makes me the winner.

597
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:46,998
I just feel like the loser sometimes.

598
00:30:52,406 --> 00:30:54,973
I know I haven't always
been the best wife.

599
00:30:58,678 --> 00:31:00,745
And I'm really sorry.

600
00:31:00,747 --> 00:31:04,148
I get angry sometimes and...

601
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,650
- I made a mistake.
- Unh-unh. Shh.

602
00:31:06,652 --> 00:31:09,320
I made a terrible mistake.

603
00:31:09,322 --> 00:31:10,921
Don't say that.

604
00:31:23,835 --> 00:31:25,435
Nathan: <i>What the fuck!</i>

605
00:31:25,437 --> 00:31:27,170
You're selling your virginity?

606
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:32,275
Yeah, I thought you'd be proud of me.

607
00:31:32,277 --> 00:31:34,077
Proud of you?

608
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,678
Yeah. A lot of girls lose their
virginity for a lot less...

609
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,082
- So you're selling yourself?
- At a worthy price, for a worthy cause!

610
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,287
Don't try to tell me that sex

611
00:31:41,311 --> 00:31:42,434
- That is prostitution!
- isn't a form of currency!

612
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:44,152
Women are exploited all the time!

613
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:46,188
Let's make sure everyone feels heard
here. Let's have a conversation.

614
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,991
Wait, is this thing set
up live? Is it already up?

615
00:31:48,993 --> 00:31:52,393
(stammers) No, not y...

616
00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:53,560
Where are you going?

617
00:31:53,562 --> 00:31:54,628
- Dad!
- Guys!

618
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,163
- Stop!
- Come on!

619
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:58,232
- Where is it?
- You're being crazy!

620
00:31:58,234 --> 00:32:00,401
- No, no. You're not taking that.
- Are you serious?

621
00:32:00,403 --> 00:32:03,904
You're not taking that! No, until
you tell me you shut it down...

622
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:07,108
- Stop it!
- I'm not shutting it down!

623
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,509
Get off! Get off!

624
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:11,611
- (all shouting)
- Give my computer back!

625
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:14,147

626
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:16,116

They're clay. I think
they're from Mexico.

789
00:40:28,313 --> 00:40:29,546
- Yeah.
- <i>Oh, that's so nice.</i>

790
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:31,849
Ed prefers more traditional glass.

791
00:40:31,851 --> 00:40:35,151
Perhaps for wine, but these are...

792
00:40:35,153 --> 00:40:37,253
I'm actually more kind
of a beer guy, but...

793
00:40:37,255 --> 00:40:38,555
Oh, do you want some beer? We have some.

794
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:40,322
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Are you sure?

795
00:40:40,324 --> 00:40:42,758
- Sit down.
- Since we're talking about wine glasses,

796
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,926
let's have a toast!

797
00:40:43,928 --> 00:40:45,127
- Toast.
- Yes, toast.

798
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:47,630
Toast. The, uh...

799
00:40:47,632 --> 00:40:48,931
To, um... for...

800
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:51,400
I should make a toast.

801
00:40:51,402 --> 00:40:52,668
Bonnie: <i>Please.</i>

802
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,237
To Nathan and Bonnie.

803
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:57,873
- Because I heard...
- And none of us killing each other.

804
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,708
- (chuckles) Yeah, right.
- All right.

805
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,743
- (all laughing)
- I'm just kidding.

806
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:02,711
You're so funny.

807
00:41:04,447 --> 00:41:06,347
All right. This is yummy wine.

808
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:08,750
- Bonnie:<i> Mm, isn't it?</i>
- It's really good.

809
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,887
Is Abigail gonna join us for dinner?

810
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:13,821
She'll be down for dessert.

811
00:41:13,823 --> 00:41:16,624
She said she can only be stuck
with the grown-ups for so long.

812
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:18,225
Yeah.

813
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:20,528
I think she's just wanting
us to have some bonding time.

814
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:23,797
Teenagers. Oh, she's been probably
working on her secret project.

815
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:24,999
Mm.

816
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:26,266
I'm so curious.

817
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:28,168
Do you guys know what that is?

818
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,203
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, we just found out what it is, yeah.

819
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:32,304
No way.

820
00:41:32,306 --> 00:41:33,540
Do tell.

821
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,309
Baby? (clears throat)

822
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:40,379
It's unconventional. It's
even a little radical.

823
00:41:40,381 --> 00:41:42,048
- Good.
- Listen,

824
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,316
when I first heard
about it, I overreacted.

825
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:47,386
And I'm just gonna caution
you guys to take a breath.

826
00:41:47,388 --> 00:41:50,255
Process it before
jumping to a judgement.

827
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,157
Okay, can you just tell us what it is?

828
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:54,092
(clears throat)

829
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,996
It's... well, she's attempting to
raise money for Amnesty International.

830
00:41:57,998 --> 00:41:59,665
- All right.
- She showed me her website.

831
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:02,100
It's, like, very professionally done.

832
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:08,973
I... Abigail is...

833
00:42:10,509 --> 00:42:12,610
auctioning off her virginity

834
00:42:12,612 --> 00:42:15,880
in order to raise money
to protest sex slavery.

835
00:42:15,882 --> 00:42:17,815
- What?
- Yes.

836
00:42:17,817 --> 00:42:20,051
(scoffs) Very funny.

837
00:42:20,053 --> 00:42:21,585
No, I'm being serious.

838
00:42:21,587 --> 00:42:23,920
She said if a seven-year-old
can be sold to sex slavery,

839
00:42:23,922 --> 00:42:25,555
then no one would bat an eye

840
00:42:25,557 --> 00:42:28,925
if a white, rich American
girl would sell hers online.

841
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:33,329
- This is for real?
- Look, it's not gone live yet.

842
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:35,198
And we have no intention of
letting that happen. obviously.

843
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,834
- Of course not, no.
- Nathan, if this is some sort of joke...

844
00:42:38,836 --> 00:42:40,769
Yeah, this is not funny, Nathan.

845
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:42,071
- Bonnie:<i> Okay.</i>
- (scoffs)

846
00:42:42,073 --> 00:42:43,839
It's... it's shocking.

847
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:46,274
And a bit disturbing.

848
00:42:46,276 --> 00:42:47,776
But I think it is important

849
00:42:47,778 --> 00:42:51,246
that we... we separate
the nobility of the cause

850
00:42:51,248 --> 00:42:53,215
from the misguided means
of pursuing it, you know?

851
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:55,183
We... we champion the former

852
00:42:55,185 --> 00:42:56,918
and dissuade her from the latter, right?

853
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,919
- (vomiting)
- Oh!

854
00:42:57,921 --> 00:42:59,553
Oh, honey! Are you okay?

855
00:42:59,555 --> 00:43:01,222
That's okay. That's okay, that's okay.

856
00:43:01,224 --> 00:43:03,424
- (coughing)
- That's a human reaction.

857
00:43:03,426 --> 00:43:05,559
That's completely...
baby, get her... thank you.

858
00:43:05,561 --> 00:43:08,262
- You okay, honey?
- No, I'm not.

859
00:43:08,264 --> 00:43:09,764
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, honey!

860
00:43:09,766 --> 00:43:11,499
- Honey!
- Okay.

861
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:12,766
Thank you, thank you. That's all right.

862
00:43:12,768 --> 00:43:14,067
- Here.
- Oh, my God.

863
00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:15,568
- That's all right.
- All right.

864
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,070
This is how you parent, Nathan?

865
00:43:17,072 --> 00:43:18,839
She's been under your
roof for two minutes

866
00:43:18,841 --> 00:43:20,273
and now she's some sort of prostitute?

867
00:43:20,275 --> 00:43:21,875
- Did I tell ya?
- Great parenting!

868
00:43:21,877 --> 00:43:24,277
All right, let's all just
settle for a minute, okay?

869
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:26,346
Please. Let's just settle.

870
00:43:26,348 --> 00:43:29,249
Let's remember that we are
living in the time of...

871
00:43:29,251 --> 00:43:31,216
of Facebook and reality...

872
00:43:31,218 --> 00:43:32,685
Oh, God damn it!

873
00:43:32,687 --> 00:43:33,853
Oh, my...

874

- Shit!
- It's the shrimp.

875
00:43:36,257 --> 00:43:38,590
I had heard that Abigail
was a little slutty.

876
00:43:38,592 --> 00:43:41,127
Knowing the mother, I
wouldn't be surprised.

880
00:43:50,103 --> 00:43:51,770

You're done with dinner already?

886
00:44:21,232 --> 00:44:23,566
Look, I don't even know
where to begin about this,

887
00:44:23,568 --> 00:44:25,301
so I'm just gonna go
straight to the end.

888
00:44:25,303 --> 00:44:27,403
This is wrong, Abigail.

889
00:44:27,405 --> 00:44:28,971
Completely wrong.

890
00:44:28,973 --> 00:44:31,440
And I salute your cause. I really do.

891
00:44:31,442 --> 00:44:33,042
But... but what?

892
00:44:33,044 --> 00:44:35,477
Saluting a cause, recognizing
a problem, isn't not enough.

893
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:37,013
A person has to do something.

894
00:44:37,015 --> 00:44:39,147
Well, this something is not that, honey.

895
00:44:39,149 --> 00:44:41,817
- What about your play?
- What about my play?

896
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:43,451
You said it spoke to
you because it was about

897
00:44:43,453 --> 00:44:45,220
finding a purpose in life, which I get.

898
00:44:45,222 --> 00:44:47,355
<i>Making your mark. I get that.</i>

899
00:44:47,357 --> 00:44:50,458
You're the one who always said
a person's life needs to matter.

900
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,027
- Okay...
- Was it all just bullshit?

901
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:53,428
No, it's not.

902
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,863
And I'm not gonna give you
some long song and dance

903
00:44:55,865 --> 00:44:58,799
about how precious and
sacred your beautiful body is.

904
00:44:58,801 --> 00:45:01,202
- Mm-hmm.
- But it is not for sale, Abigail.

905
00:45:01,204 --> 00:45:02,336
Not ever.

906
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:05,206
No matter what cause,
no matter what cost.

907
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:07,407
And one day, you are going
to look back at this...

908
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:09,043
probably pretty soon... and think,

909
00:45:09,045 --> 00:45:10,811
"What the fuck was I thinking?

910
00:45:10,813 --> 00:45:14,313
Why was I gonna fuck
up my life like that?"

911
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:15,915
Must be nice to be so right.

912
00:45:15,917 --> 00:45:18,151
- I'm not right!
- <i>So perfect.</i>

913
00:45:18,153 --> 00:45:20,153
I'm not fucking perfect!

914
00:45:21,223 --> 00:45:23,256
You think you know me so well?

915
00:45:23,258 --> 00:45:25,925
I fuck up, too. I make mistakes.

916
00:45:25,927 --> 00:45:28,327
I've made mistakes bigger than this.

917
00:45:34,668 --> 00:45:36,501
Last year, I cheated on Ed.

918
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:41,273
I ended it very quickly, but...

919
00:45:46,412 --> 00:45:48,780
The two things I value most in this life

920
00:45:48,782 --> 00:45:51,783
are my kids and my marriage.

921
00:45:51,785 --> 00:45:54,852
And I risked destroying both of them.

922
00:45:56,355 --> 00:45:57,855
Just because I was...

923
00:46:00,326 --> 00:46:02,859
selfish or...

924
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:06,329
So don't... don't tell
me I'm perfect, okay?

925
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:10,633
I know about fucking up.

926
00:46:12,704 --> 00:46:15,972
And fucking up doesn't make
your dad and I get back together.

927
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:20,475
Fucking up doesn't fix your life.

928
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,644
Okay?

929
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:28,818
At least what you were gonna
do was for a good cause, and...

930
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:32,988
I was just being selfish.

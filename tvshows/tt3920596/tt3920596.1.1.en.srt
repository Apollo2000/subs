Stop moving.

20
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,299
It's in the back.

21
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:19,930
What is all this?

22
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,725
Some costume night
or something.

23
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,729
<i>School fundraiser.</i>

24
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,985
<i>The victim's
on the back terrace.</i>

25
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,820
- Witnesses?
-<i> Plenty.</i>

26
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:37,239
Though not
a lot of clarity.

27
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,161
How
compromised is the scene?

28
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,496
Pretty good job of it.

29
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,794
Already dead
when we arrived.

30
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,641
Oh, my God.

31
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,771
It wasn't just the mothers;
it was the dads, too.

32
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,440
Thing about fundraisers...

33
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,858
Everybody wants to prove
who's the richest.

34
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:13,817
They're vicious.

35
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,319
Add alcohol to the mix

36
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,112
and the fact that
women don't let things go...

37
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,615
They're like the Olympic
athletes of grudges.

38
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,825
It's sexist how the women
always get blamed.

39
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:25,078
It all goes back to that
incident on Orientation Day.

40
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:28,123
And at the root of it
was Madeline Mackenzie.

41
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,417
<i> You have nothing to be nervous about.</i>

42
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,836
Your sister loved going
there and so will you.

43
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,463
In fact,
you should be excited.

44
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,256
Do you know why?

45
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,551
Because this is
the very first day

46
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,012
<i>of the rest of your life.</i>

47
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,639
Okay, woman.

48
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,016
I am not 100% sure
about that tone, young lady.

49
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,770
And could you please
turn it down, please?

50
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,313
- <i> Thank you.</i>

51
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,860
- Mother...
<i>- Fucker!</i>

52
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,612
Chloe Adeline Mackenzie!

53
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:01,031
- You were thinking it.
- Because I was scared.

54
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,241
Do you want to see how teenagers die?
This is how.

55
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,035
This young lady
in front of me

56
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,787
is driving and texting at the same time.

57
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,247
You're going to d--

58
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,833
<i>Oh, this is just--</i>

59
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,335
I'll be right back.

60
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:15,879
They're dead.

61
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,303
Excuse me.
You must stop.

62
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,930
You're gonna kill
yourself for some--

63
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:25,973
<i>- Mom?</i>
- What is your problem?

64
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,265
Abigail,
what are you doing?

65
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,768
You were supposed
to be on the bus.

66
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:32,437
- She picked me up, okay? - You know how
I feel about you driving with texters.

67
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,398
It is worse than
drinking and driving.

68
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,816
Get out of the car.

69
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,859
I'm not getting
out of the car.

70
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,528
We're three blocks
from school, okay?

71
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:43,198
Fine. If I catch you
driving and texting again,

72
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:46,618
- I will find your mother and I will throw
this at her. - Mom! Don't-- you--

73
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:49,663
Oh! Ah!

74
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,290
It's possible
that had she not fallen,

75
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,334
nobody would've
gotten killed.

76
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:57,295
- Ouch.
<i>- Did you hurt yourself?</i>

77
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,589
No. The lady
just tripped.

78
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:12,269
Shouldn't we make sure
the lady's okay?

79
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,899
Yeah.

80
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,281
Damn it!

81
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,950
Stay here.
Keep your seat belt on.

82
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,541
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

83
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,210
I think I rolled
my ankle.

84
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,879
You should put
some ice on it.

85
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,964
I would, but I have to get
my daughter to school.

86
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,842
It's Orientation Day and this
school is terrible about tardiness.

87
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,677
- Oh, at Otter Bay?
- Yes.

88
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:46,887
That's where
we're going.

89
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,597
My son, Ziggy,
is about to start.

90
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,224
- Ziggy, like Ziggy Stardust?
- Yeah.

91
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,851
- That's a great name.
- Thanks.

92
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,436
This is my daughter, Chloe,

93
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,814
the one shrinking from
embarrassment over there.

94
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,441
Are you new
to Monterey?

95
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:02,235
Yeah, we just moved here
a few weeks ago.

96
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,654
Well, I'm Madeline
Martha Mackenzie.

97
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,448
I always say the Martha,
but no one calls me that.

98
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,241
They call me Madeline.

99
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,911
I'm Jane.
Jane No-Middle-Name Chapman.

100
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,163
Jane No-Middle-Name Chapman.

101
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,623
I like you already.

102
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,458
You're an intrinsically
nice person,

103
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,126
and I have a nose
for these sorts of things.

104
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,711
No, what Madeline had

105
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,922
was a nose for
everybody else's business.

106
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,006
Oh, my God.

107
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,341
Believe me, I know.

108
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,888
Um, do you need
a ride or something?

109
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,390
I'm a stay-at-home mom myself,
so I'm happy to welcome

110
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,518
another full-time mom
to the ranks.

111
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,686
<i>You know, sometimes I think</i>
<i>it's like us against them,</i>

112
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,730
<i>the career mommies.</i>

113
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:41,858
Them and all their various board
meetings that are so important.

114
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,611
Google this, Yahoo that.

115
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,655
Please, I think they spend more
time on those board meetings

116
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,949
than they do actually parenting,
if you know what I mean.

117
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,700
My mom's an active talker.

118
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,703
I actually have
a part-time job.

119
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,872
<i>Oh, yeah, so do I, but
it doesn't really count.</i>

120
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,834
The over-and-under in this
town is about 150,000.

121
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,586
I work in community theater
20 hours a week,

122
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,131
so I'm definitely
an "under."

123
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,423
What do you do?

124
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,259
Oh, just bookkeeping, so...

125
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,844
most definitely
an "under," too.

126
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,221
<i>When I grow up,</i>

127
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,057
I'm gonna run
a massive label.

128
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,433
Do you have plans?

129
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,562
No.

130
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,480
He's a little nervous.

131
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,691
Relax, he's walking in
with Chloe.

132
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,317
That's like walking in
with the golden ticket.

133
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,571
<i>What kind of
music do you listen to?</i>

134
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,741
Don't tell me.
Bowie.

135
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:39,166
An autopsy is still
being conducted

136

00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,406
You are.
So bad.

161
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,075
We are so bad.

162
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,826
There should be,
like, a five-year limit

163
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,828
on how long couples
get to be gooey.

164
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,122
He's a lot younger
than her.

00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,755

168

00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,564
Great.
See you then.

176
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,692
- It's so pretty.
- I know, right?

177
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,903
- Madeline, hello!
- Yes, of course. You guys go play.

178
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,072
- Hi.
- How are you? Pregnant again?

179
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,365
Of course.
When am I not?

180
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,325
- You look fantastic.
- Thank you.

181
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,495
- Did you...? - Oh, uh, no, but
you're sweet to think I did.

182
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,539
- Well, you look fabulous.
- Thank you.

183
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,500
Hi, Jackie.
Good to see you.

184
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,627
Okay, Gabby is such a gossip.
We don't like her.

185
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,421
Hey, Maddie, have you
seen Justin at all?

186
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,214
Oh, I think
he whooshed past here.

187
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,966
Are we doing the wine tasting
next week at your house?

188
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,634
- Yes. I'll send you an email.
- Okay.

189
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:55,885
I don't know
where Ziggy went.

190
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,345
Oh, he's with Chloe.
He's fine.

191
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,639
- Oh! Hi, Madeline!
- Renata! Hi, hi!

192
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,642
- So good to see you. You look adorable.
- Thank you so much.

193
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,602
This is Jane Chapman.
She's new here.

194
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,646
- Hi. - Welcome. Renata Klein.

195
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,189
- Thank you.
- This is Amabella.

196
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,775
Hi.
That's a beautiful dress.

197
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,986
- How was your summer?
- It was wonderful.

198
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,654
Very busy with
the kids and camp.

199
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:15,989
Just, um, flew by.

200
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,615
- Same.
- How was yours, yeah?

201
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,076
Well, joined
the board at PayPal.

202
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,370
What was I thinking, adding
one more thing to my life?

203
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,122
But, you know-- oh!

204
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,999
- Hold on, these are my "Hamilton" tickets.
- Mm. Okay.

205
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:29,002
- I've seen it four times. Yes?
- Okay. I'll see you in there.

206
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,670
Here, come meet my best friend.
Celeste!

207
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,047
Hey, Bill.
How you been?

208
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,965
- Madeline!
- When did you get to town?

209
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,550
Oh, late last night.

210
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,677
- You didn't call me.
- No, I'm sorry.

211
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,179
And how did you get
more beautiful?

212
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:43,183
Oh, baby,
Madeline's over there.

213
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,351
Oh.

214
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,478
Yeah, um,
we'll exchange numbers.

215
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,896
You're wearing
the dress I bought you!

216
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,981
I know, my new dress,
my new shoes,

217
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,317
my new friend,
Jane Chapman.

218
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,319
- Hi. I'm Celeste.
- Hi.

219
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,488
She came to my rescue when I was
trying to save young lives.

220
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,656
It's a whole story.
I'm gonna kill Abigail.

221
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,075
That's her son, Ziggy,
right there,

222
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,576
who's playing with
Chloe and the boys.

223
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,661
Can you believe that
they're in first grade?

224
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,622
Oh, I know.
Take a lot of pictures.

225
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,665
-<i> Hi, Maddie.</i>
- Nathan!

226
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,793
- Come on, boys! Come on!
- Hi, Bonnie.

227
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,046
- This is Jane and this is Bonnie, Nathan.
- Nice to meet you.

228
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,215
- Nice to meet you.
- Skye. Oh, I love this.

229
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,966
Oh, thank you.
I made it in Peru.

230
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,344
Of course you did.

231
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:22,514
We were saying we should get Skye
and Chloe together for a playdate.

232
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,683
They're half-sisters and they
pretty much never see each other.

233
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,060
- It's ridiculous.
- Are they?

234
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,479
I-- am I missing
the math?

235
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,106
<i>We were all concerned
about Bonnie and Madeline</i>

236
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,857
having their girls
in first grade together.

237
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,527
You know, what that would do
to the classroom dynamic.

238
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,654
- Abby is Chloe's half-sister,
so we just... - Right.

239
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,616
Of course.
Just have Nathan call me.

240
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,368
Can I have a word
with you for a second?

241
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:46,204
Um, yes.
Just-- just one.

242
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:49,457
I just wanted to-- ahem, I just
wanted to ask you if you were okay

243
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,001
with swapping the weekends so that
Abby can come with us this Friday.

244
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,170
We're going up to Bonnie's
mom's house up in Camarillo

245
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,422
and Abby doesn't
wanna miss it.

246
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,006
She and Bonnie's mom
actually have

247
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,133
a special connection.

248
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,803
- Of course.
- You sure?

249
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,221
Do I not look sure?

250
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:06,224
Jane, we should go
because it gets very busy.

251
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,642
- Yeah, yeah.
- Chloe!

252
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,060
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

253
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,729
-<i> Ziggy, come on.</i>
- Come on, Zig.

254
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:12,814
Come on.

255
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:13,898
We're looking at all angles.

256
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,442
Nobody has been ruled out.

257
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,987
So we're, like, seriously
using the word "murder"?

258
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,370
I actually like Nathan.

259
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,330
I wouldn't go
all the way to like,

260
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,500
<i>but I accept and acknowledge</i>
<i>that he's a decent human being.</i>

261
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,587
<i>I'm just legitimately surprised
to see him at orientation</i>

262
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,214
because it's not like he was ever
there for Abigail's first day.

263
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,383
And Bonnie
is his new wife?

264
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,844
Yeah, she's
the very pretty one.

265
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,889
In fact, she's so pretty
and free-spirited

266
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,141
and bohemian
and all-loving

267
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,059
that sometimes
I just want to...

268
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,103
Punch her in the face?

269
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,771
Hey.

270
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,441
You're gonna love
this girl.

271
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,610
Oh, good,
they saved my spot.

272
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,695
- Hello, Tom!
<i>- Madeline!</i>

273
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,197
What's happened to you?

274
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,907
I bravely
injured myself.

275
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,910
I've twisted my ankle.
Come meet my new friend, Jane.

276
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,912
<i>Here, sit down.</i>

277
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,914
<i>It's my knight
in shining armor.</i>

278
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,459
Oh. She rescued me like
a wounded dog in the street.

279
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:15,668
Hi.

280
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,794
And you know
what else?

281
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,880
- She's funny.
- Here.

282
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,007
- Nice to meet you, funny Jane.
- Nice to meet you.

283
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,593
I think she just moved to this
area for your delicious coffee.

284
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,513
- Oh. - So, do you mind
getting-- would you like one?

285
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,056
- Yeah, please.
- Three, please.

286
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,641
And will you throw in
something chocolate

287
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,100
that won't make
my ass look fat?

288
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,310
- You got it.
- Thank you.

289
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,440
Everybody moves here
for the education.

290
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,193
Basically, it's private school
at a public school price.

291
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,320
Anyway, you're gonna love it.
Do you surf?

292
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,738
Do you have
a husband, or...?

293
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,281
I shouldn't assume.

294
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,367
Boyfriend, girlfriend?
I'm open to all possibilities.

295
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,078
No, no husband
or partner, just me.

296
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,080
- What about Ziggy's dad?
- Easy, girl.

297
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,123
- Okay, I'm only wondering.
- It's fine.

298
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,458
Uh, he's not
in the picture.

299
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,876
He was actually
never in the picture.

300
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,670
- We weren't together.
- Really?

301
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,171
-<i> Where'd you move here from?</i>
- Just Santa Cruz.

302
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,006
I was up there
with my parents.

303
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,841
Oh, you know she does part-time
bookkeeping as well.

304
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,134
Isn't that great?

305
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,386
You know, I work
at the theater,

306
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,554
and whenever we go
into production,

307
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,264
we hire freelance
accountants,

308
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,682
so I'll ask them
if they have anything for you.

309
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:14,269
You're... so nice.
Thank you.

310
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,896
This is Monterey.
We pound people with nice.

311
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,939
To death.

312
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:21,901
What?

313
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,195
What do I know
of Jane Chapman?

314
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,030
Nothing, nothing.
I'm fine.

315
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,073
<i>You okay?</i>

316
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,451
Nobody knows nothing
about anybody.

317
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,788
You can write that down,
Detective, and underline it.

318
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:37,333
- What is it, honey?
- It's weird.

319
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:42,088
Sometimes when I'm in a new
place, I get this sensation.

320
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,048
Like, if only
I were here.

321
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,969
- But you are here.
- I know.

322
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:51,222
It's like I'm on
the outside looking in.

323
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,766
Or like-- you know,
like, I see this life

324
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,936
and this moment,
and it's so wonderful,

325
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,689
but it doesn't
quite belong to me.

326
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,192
Does that make
any sense?

327
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,613
Yeah.

328
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,324
- Are you following this?
- Yeah.

329
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,118
And, like, I look at you,
and you're so beautiful.

330
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,828
- That's true.
- Oh, stop.

331
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,371
And I'm not saying that
to embarrass you at all,

332
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,623
but it is true.

333
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,416
You are,
and so are you, and--

334
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,209
I agree.

335
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,211
You guys are just right.

336
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,671
You're exactly right.

337
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,049
And for some reason,
that makes me feel...

338
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,009
wrong, I guess.

339
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,553
- It's crazy. I know I sound crazy.
- It's not crazy.

340
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,597
I mean, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

341
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,016
But if you were crazy, you'd
fit in perfectly in this town.

342
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,894
Right, Tom?

00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,404
Come on, Bonnie,
give me a break.

368

But a likeable one.

Hi.

- Fun!

390
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,407

You already made friends?

Chloe? Of course
she's networking.

399
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,510
Hi. Hi, Christine.

400
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,136
Okay.

401
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,430
I just want to introduce
you to Juliette.

402
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,848
This is
my Amabella's nanny.

403
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,058
- Oh, hello.
- Pleased to meet you.

404
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,518
She's French.

405
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,394
Good for them to learn
a language, you know?

406
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,355
I just thought it was nice for the
nannies to get to know each other

407
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,439
and have your own
little support system.

408
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,358
Renata,
Jane is not a nanny.

409
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,859
She's a mom,
just young.

410
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,486
Like you used to be?

411
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,029
<i>- Maddie.</i>
- Oh, like we used to be?

412
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,031
- Maddie, hi.
- Hi.

413
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,492
<i>I heard you're working
at the community theater.</i>

414
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,536
I wanted to talk to you
about the petition thing,

415
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,412
about the play.

416
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,039
There's been some concern
about it being appropriate.

417
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,999
There's a petition
to stop the play?

418
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,461
That play was kind of like
a lifeline for Madeline.

419
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,213
You know, it tethered her
to a purpose.

420
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,006
I signed it.

421
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,008
<i>- Excuse me!</i>
- You signed it?

422
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,135
- I did. I didn't know you were involved.
- I had--

423
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,720
<i> Can I have everyone's
attention for a moment?</i>

424
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,806
She grew up wanting
to be Betty Grable.

425
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,058
<i>- All my first-grade kiddos.</i>
- Ended up Betty Crocker.

426
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,227

- ...and their parents, please.

427
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,104
- Come here.
- Hi, Chloe.

428
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,023
Wonderful.
Okay.

429
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:15,528
We have had
such a wonderful morning,

430
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,321
<i>but we need to have</i>
<i>a little chat,</i>

431
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,283
and it's a little bit
serious, okay?

432
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,369
Someone hurt "Anabella."

433
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,538
-<i> Excuse me. Amabella.</i> - Oh.

434
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,541
- Oh, no.
- And I would like whoever it was

435
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,960
to come over
and apologize, okay?

436
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:34,255
Because we don't hurt our
friends at school, do we?

437
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:35,882
- No.
<i>- No, we don't.</i>

438
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,760
And if we do,
we always say...

439
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,138
- Sorry.
- Sorry, that's right.

440
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,892
<i>Because that's what big
first-grade children do, right?</i>

441
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,518
Yeah, yeah.

442
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,061
Okay.

443
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,980
Baby, someone hurt you,
sweet pea?

444
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,773
Amabella, do you think
it was an accident, maybe?

445
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,025
An accident?

446
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,276
Look at her neck,
for God's sake.

447
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,278
It has marks on it.

448
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:01,198
Amabella, sweetie, can you tell
me if it was a boy or a girl?

449
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,742
- It was a boy.
- It was a boy?

450
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,702
- Oh...
- What was his name?

451
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,621
Maybe she doesn't
want to say.

452
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,414
Well, um, Mrs. Klein,
my problem is that

453
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,417
the children don't know
one another's names yet,

454
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,711
so Amabella
cannot tell me who--

455
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,463
We're not just
gonna let this go.

456
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,465
Absolutely not.

457
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,925
Okay, um...

458
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,552
Mrs. Klein,
I'm so sorry...

459
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,137
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.

460
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,348
They're gonna find out.
Just give her a second.

461
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,434
- Did you see what happened?
- No.

462
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,728
<i>- You're their teacher.</i>
<i>- You know what?</i>

463
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,189
Um, uh, Amabella,
sweetie,

464
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,692
could you maybe point
to the boy who hurt you?

465
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,570
- Come on, really?
- Shh.

466
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:50,581

- No, him.

467
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,461
- This boy?
<i>- Yes, he tried to choke me.</i>

468
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,046
- What?
<i>- It wasn't me.</i>

469
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,214
<i>Yes, it was.</i>

470
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,465
<i>Ziggy, sweetie,</i>

471
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,342
<i>we just need you</i>
<i>to say "sorry."</i>

472
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:03,010
I didn't do anything.

473
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,681
I didn't.

474
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:10,351
Are you sure that it was
this little boy, sweetie?

475
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,313
Could she
have gotten it wrong?

476
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,399
<i>Can you say
you're sorry to Amabella?</i>

477
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,442
She's hurt
quite badly.

478
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,695
- It wasn't me.
- Ziggy, look at me.

479
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,155
- Promise.
<i>- We don't have to lie.</i>

480
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,116
<i>We just want to say</i>
<i>we're sorry.</i>

481
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,575
Ziggy doesn't lie.

482
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,161
I can assure you Amabella
is telling the truth.

483
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,163
If my son says he didn't
do it, I believe him.

484
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,623
Of course.
Um, you know what?

485
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,792
I don't know
if this is the best way

486
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,419
to deal with this, so--

487
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,295
<i>I agree, but now we are,</i>

488
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:41,590
so maybe the child needs to take
responsibility for his actions.

489
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:45,052
<i>And he needs to see</i>
<i>there are consequences.</i>

490
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:48,514
Little boys don't get to go around
anymore hurting little girls.

491
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,349
And none of us
want to raise bullies,

492
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:53,644
so we don't have to
pretend we didn't do it.

493
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,896
It's okay.
I believe you.

494
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,691
Jane, can you just make
your son apologize?

495
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,985
- Renata!
- Stay out of it.

496
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,528
<i>I can't make him apologize</i>

497
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,405
for something
that I know he didn't do.

498
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,365
We will schedule a meeting
for another time.

499
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,325
We can handle this
later.

500
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,037
Okay, this is unacceptable.
Let's go, baby.

501
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,497
- Let's go, sweet pea. - Ms. Barnes:
<i> Um, all right,</i> everyone, thank you.

502
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,541
<i>Not that there's a
right little girl to strangle,</i>

503
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,294
but he picked the wrong
little girl to strangle.

504
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,004
Ziggy...

505
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,256
do you see her neck?

506
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,342
If you ever touch my little
girl like that again,

507
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,635
you're gonna be
in big trouble.

508
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,845
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

509
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:28,846
Well?

510
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,347
Now you owe him
an apology.

511
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:31,849
- Madeline.
- Renata.

512
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:34,101
The battle lines
were drawn right there.

513
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:38,689
We never had a trivia night
end in bloodshed before.

514
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,275
How dare she speak
to a child like that?

515
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,153
I mean, isn't there some sort
of students bill of rights?

516
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,614
Celeste used to be a lawyer,
a very good lawyer.

517
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,949
I mean, isn't there due
process for a first-grader?

518
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,535
- Am I wrong?
- Well, he's not being punished, so--

519
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,412
- Well, he's being stigmatized as a bully.
- Come on, guys.

520
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,456
Yeah, I think we should not
make a big deal out of this.

521
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,833
- Just...
- Madeline.

522
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,335
Harper Stimson.
Hi.

523
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,669
Jane just
didn't fit here.

524
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,754
Kind of like
a dirty old Prius

525
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,422
parked outside
of Barneys.

526
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,216
<i>- Welcome to Monterey.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

527
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,217
<i>It was a mistake</i>

528
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,968
<i>to let people compete,</i>

529
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,596
but that is not
what got someone killed.

530
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,014
Hi, Celeste.
How is Perry?

531
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,684
Oh, uh, he's good.
Thank you.

532
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,979
<i> You didn't ask me how Ed was.</i>

533
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,898
I'm sorry.

534
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:23,067
<i>Listen, Renata happens to be</i>
<i>one of my best friends,</i>

535
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,111
so if there's any way I can
play the role of peacemaker

536
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,779
in all of this,
just please--

537
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,614
Thank you, Harper. That's
very sweet of you to offer.

538
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,241
And I'll make sure
and let everybody know

539
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,992
that Renata
is your best friend.

540
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,747
I'm only trying
to help.

541
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,999
I'm sure you are.

542
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:42,128
This could get ugly.

543
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,879
We could just
let it blow over.

544
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:47,383
Things never blow over
once Madeline gets involved.

545
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,927
-<i> They blow up.</i>
- Bitch.

546
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:17,913
There was a 4x3 stellate,
full-thickness scalp laceration

547
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:21,542
located on the superior
occipital portion of the scalp.

548
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:24,545
We also discovered a
full-thickness scalp contusion

549
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:27,173
and associated gall
and subgaleal hemorrhages,

550
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,134
and a putrefied
and liquefied brain.

551
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,719
So, it was a lot of blood.

552
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,429
Chloe.

553
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,309
<i> Thank you.</i>

554
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,896
The teacher couldn't
have handled it worse.

555
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,440
"Point out the suspect,
Amabella"?

556
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,150
Are you kidding me?

557
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:48,444
I take it this Jane's
kind of damaged.

558
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,362
Why do you say that?

559
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,947
You're drawn
to damaged people.

560
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,742
- I am not.
- Even Celeste.

561
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,286
There's something wounded
about her, if you ask me.

562
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,373
I didn't ask, and I'm not
drawn to damaged people.

563
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,876
Do I like to help
people in need? Yes.

564
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,295
Last time I checked,
that's not a character flaw.

565
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,799
- I see that look.
- Hmm.

566
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,093
I just think to be accused
of something so horrible

567
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,638
on your very first day
at a new school...

568
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,598
Can you imagine
anything worse?

569
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:21,435
Mmm, being choked,
maybe?

570
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:25,189
Bruises heal, stigmas
can last a lifetime.

571
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,357
You don't think
assault victims

572
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,484
bear lifetime
emotional injuries?

573
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:31,904
I don't know.
Is there a recent study

574
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,864
you'd like to illuminate
the family about, Abigail?

575
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:36,283
- All right.
- All right, what?

576
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:39,245
- Nothing.
- Well, it's not nothing.

577
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,372
It's something.
You said, "All right."

578
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:42,873
Would you like
to assign meaning to that

579
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,458
or was it
just a nervous tic?

580
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,627
<i>Guys, Mom had a day.</i>

581
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:49,213
- And don't you start.
- I'm on your side, woman.

582
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:52,049
- I'm gonna go with a nervous tic.
- Mmm.

583
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:55,511
I think his "all right" meant "let's
not fight at the dinner table."

584
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,929
Were we fighting?

585
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,138
I didn't realize
we were fighting.

586
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,890
We were about to.

587
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:02,268
You said I probably read some
study on women assault victims,

588
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,811
and I would've
responded with, "No,

589
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,604
I learned it in my Self-Defense
and Wellness class,

590
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,690
which happens to be
taught by Bonnie,

591
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,817
who, by the very mention of her
name, makes your eyes twitch,

592
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,611
so Ed said "all right"
to head it off.

593
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:14,530
I see.

594
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,866
Well, speaking of Bonnie, do
you know what she did today?

595
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,037
She signed a petition to stop
our production of "Avenue Q."

596
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,164
Is this the play where the
puppets drop the F-bombs?

597
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,207
Cool!

598
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,834
It is not only
not about that,

599
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,544
but it's actually
a play that you should see

600
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,796
because it deals with
the struggle of young adults

601
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,674
being disillusioned
with life,

602
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,634
feeling demoralized
and defrauded

603
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:38,387
by the false promises
of tomorrow.

604
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,390
I can get
all that here.

605
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,563
What did I say?

606
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,446
<i>Look at me.
Look at the camera.</i>

607
00:26:56,741 --> 00:27:01,035
<i>So patient, so helpful.</i>

608
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:05,331
<i>Big smiles.</i>
<i>Give me a big smile.</i>

609
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,666
<i>Good.</i>
<i>One more with a smile.</i>

610
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,960
Just look at me and smile.
One shot.

611
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:12,087
Look at the camera.
Look at me, look at me.

612
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,048
Yeah, but a big smile.

613
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,966
Can you guy-- and just a little
bit closer together, guys.

614
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,843
Hey, Mom, you wanna
play Angry Beaver?

615
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,970
In a minute. I just need
to get one more shot.

616
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:21,930
I think the angry beaver
is gonna get you, Mom.

617
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,432
Yeah. Is he?

618
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,267
- Oh, I hope not. That-- - Rawr!

619
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,478
- Oh, my God!
- The angry beaver is back!

620
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,897
And he is hungry!

621
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,482
Hungry for Mama's beaver.

622
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,192
Just stop!

623
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,612
Oh, she his delicious!
Mmm, have a bite of this.

624
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,239
Mmm!

625
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,533
- Hi. - What happened?
You're not going to Vienna?

626
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,286
No, I still have to go, but I'll
get a flight out tomorrow instead.

627
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,163
- Really?
- Yes!

628
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:48,123
It's their first day
of school tomorrow.

629
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,625
I can't miss that.

630
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,252
- Thank you.
- Of course.

631
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,715
<i>I kind of agree with Thea...</i>

632
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,634
People over 40
shouldn't be gushy.

633
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,636
It's not cute.

634
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,227
I mean, last week,
she came home

635
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,187
and peeled potatoes
at a homeless shelter,

636
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,814
and she couldn't stop
talking about

637
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,817
what a beautiful experience
it was to contribute.

638
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,319
I mean, she whines if I
ask her to set the table,

639
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,863
but peel one fucking
potato with Bonnie...

640
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:24,660
Well, Bonnie is
a positive influence.

641
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,497
What, you'd rather Abby be out
with her friends, smoking pot?

642
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,835
I just feel like they're
both slipping away.

643
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,253
You should've
seen Chloe today.

644
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,880
She just marched
right into that school

645
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,924
like some sort
of a woman-child.

646
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,551
She never
turned around.

647
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,010
It was like
she was on her own.

648
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,512
"Bye, Mom.
See you later."

649
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,058
I just feel like
they're gonna grow up

650
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:50,310
and they're gonna
be gone, and...

651
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,770
this will be you and I,
and we're gonna be on

652
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:53,897
to another chapter
of our life.

653
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,649
You have
another chapter,

654
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,359
you have a business.

655
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,112
And-- and... I don't.

656
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,030
I'm a mom.

657
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,949
This is my universe.

658
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,577
And currently, that
universe is in meltdown

659
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,955
because my oldest daughter prefers to
hang out with her fucking step-thing.

660
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:14,168
Hey, you will never
lose them.

661
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,003
And you know that.

662
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,755
I just thought one day
Nathan would get his due.

663
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,468
For some reason,
Abigail would love me more.

664
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,888
He hasn't paid in the
slightest for any of it.

665
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,264
And now
he's got Bonnie,

666
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:31,143
and she's younger
and sexier and prettier.

667
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:34,438
She probably gives
mint-flavored, organic blowjobs.

668
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:37,524
And Abigail likes to hang out
with them and be buddies.

669
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:39,318
And he got it all.

670
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,527
He won.

671
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,491
Okay.

672
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,160
Well, speaking
as the consolation prize,

673
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:49,703
we're gonna have
a pretty big fight

674
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:51,205
- about what you just said.
- No, no, no. Ed...

675
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,956
But not tonight.
Not tonight.

676
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,042
I did not mean it
like that.

677
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,419
You are the greatest thing
that ever happened to me,

678
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:01,507
and don't you for one minute
think anything else.

679
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,676
It's just entirely
possible for me

680
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,845
to love you
with all my heart

681
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:09,515
and still feel...

682
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,308
Hurt over your ex.

683
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,438
Come here.

684
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,363
<i>♪ So, baby ♪</i>

685
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:28,951
<i>♪ When times are bad ♪</i>

686
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:32,996
<i>♪ Call on me, darling,</i>
<i>and I'll come to you... ♪</i>

687
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,057
Ooh!

688
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,600
You okay?

689
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,646
Fine.

690
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,280
I'm not liked.

691
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:13,328
What was that?

692
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,914
I said I'm not liked.

693
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,584
That simply
isn't true, honey.

694
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:22,296
It's one thing to be demonized for
having the temerity of a career.

695
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,506
But--

696
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,341
but look at this.

697
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,554
Look at our life.

698
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:32,848
What kind of person
chooses to work?

699
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,725
Certainly not a mother,

700
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,477
by any acceptable
standards.

701
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,022
You should've seen

702
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,607
the way they looked
at me today.

703
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,233
Oh, my God.

704
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:49,573
And on the one morning that I
chose not to go to the office...

705
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:53,201
- Yep, yep, yep. - ...and join
my daughter for her orientation.

706
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:56,663
And then defend her when she's
physically assaulted...

707
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:01,668
And, yes, I reacted.

708
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:04,713
- Humanly, like any mom would.
- Hmm.

709
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,426
And then, I'm met
with utter contempt.

710
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,927
Look, I'm sure
there are those,

711
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,305
women especially,
who would resent you.

712
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,390
I mean, look at you.
Come on.

713
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,935
You're beautiful, hugely successful,
financially independent,

714
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:22,022
on the school committee,
the-- the board of the aquarium.

715
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:24,191
Huh?

716
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,901
- Right?
- Yeah.

717
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,990
Hell, yeah.

718
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:35,369
And to make matters
even worse...

719
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,874
you're beyond sexy.

720
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:44,252
Mmm!

721
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,052
Women.

722
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:54,012
You all want to be
the envy of your friends,

723
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:57,641
but God forbid
you garner too much of it.

724
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,323
<i>The mom was awful,</i>

725
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,200
but the girl seemed fine.

726
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,993
<i>So, what's gonna happen?</i>

727
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,246
Um, I don't know.

728
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,956
I think the teacher said

729
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,000
that we should just let
it go, move forward,

730
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:27,504
so I guess that's
what we're gonna do.

731
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:30,424
<i>I still don't understand</i>
<i>why you chose to move there.</i>

732
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,050
<i>All alone.</i>

733
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,219
I'm not.
I have friends.

734
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:36,221
People here are actually
very friendly.

735
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,140
<i>People need family</i>
<i>in their lives, you know?</i>

736
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,850
<i>I really just think</i>
<i>you should come back here.</i>

737
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,686
Do we have to get into this
every single time we talk?

738
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,148
I'm gonna go check
on Ziggy.

739
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,651
Jesus.

740
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,122
<i>Hello?</i>

741
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,749
Hey, Mom.

742
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,375
I'm sorry.

743
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:09,254
I love you.

744
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:10,797
<i>I love--</i>

745
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:30,418
Hi, baby.

746
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,296
Sorry I woke you up.

747
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,799
Am I in trouble?

748
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:38,426
No, of course not.

749
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,391
Hey, you trust me,
right?

750
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,434
And I trust you.

751
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,897
Did you touch
that little girl, baby?

752
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,816
It's okay if you did.

753
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,199
Ziggy?

754
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:03,243
No.

755
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:05,453
Okay.

756
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,414
I believe you.

757
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,251
Why did she say I did?

758
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:13,837
I don't know.
Maybe she was confused.

759
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:16,381
She probably
just got it wrong.

760
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:18,592
Am I going to have
any friends?

761
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,510
Of course you are,
my love.

762
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,804
You're gonna have
so many friends.

763
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,141
Come here.

764
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,483
Yeah?

765
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,404
- Honey?
- Yeah.

766
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:42,115
I think we need to talk
about the SAT tutor.

767
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,408
Mom...

768
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,160
I know what
you're gonna say,

769
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,412
but your scores just aren't
good enough right now, honey.

770
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:49,289
- And I-- - You know, the
whole college thing,

771
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,958
it's kind of a racket,
especially liberal arts.

772
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,835
People go off and study
Homer for four years

773
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,963
and then you graduate with a ton
of debt and no job prospect.

774
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:59,507
Okay, let me be clear.

775
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:02,427
You're going to college.

776
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,137
Ed didn't go
and he's doing all right.

777
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,972
Yeah, but Ed studied
computer engineering.

778
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:07,307
Do you want to be
a computer engineer?

779
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:08,516
And Dad--
he never went

780
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,560
and he seems
perfectly happy in life.

781
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:13,813
Career-wise.

782
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,231
Okay, well, let's just
finish that analogy.

783
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,108
Let's not leave
Bonnie out of this.

784
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,445
Her little cup just runneth over
with happiness, doesn't it?

785
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:23,365
With no college degree
at all.

786
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,784
I'm sorry that you hate Bonnie
and that I'm unable to.

787
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,327
I don't hate Bonnie.

788
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:29,829
And this isn't about
your dad or Bonnie or me.

789
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,748
This is about you, Abigail,
and your future.

790
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:34,167
And what I'm saying is
is the metric of success

791
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,086
is not always monetary
or career-related.

792
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,004
It can be a much more
holistic equation.

793
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,715
Okay, I'm not gonna pretend
to be the person in your life

794
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,135
who knows the most about the
holistic wonder of the world.

795
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,637
What I do know,

796
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:49,891
and I know this for sure,
Abigail, is that...

797
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:52,602
when it all comes down to it,
you have to be independent

798
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:54,145
and you have to be
self-sufficient.

799
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,481
I was a very young mother
when I had you.

800
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,274
All that "it takes
a village" crap

801
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,068
is only good
to a certain extent,

802
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,945
because even the best-laid
plans of your life

803
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:03,697
go poof in your face.

804
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,282
And in that case,
you need to be strong,

805
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,493
and independent,
and educated,

806
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:10,412
and-- and a strong woman.

807
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:14,124
- Be--
- You said strong twice.

808
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,918
You kind of remind me of a space
alien right now, you know that?

809
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:22,090
Can I...?

810
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,302
No.

811
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:40,650
<i>"E is for Ernest
who choked on a peach."</i>

812
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:45,363
"F is for Fanny,
sucked dry by a leech."

813
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:46,990
Eww!

814
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,616
Mm-hmm.
That's what you get

815
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,493
if you go down to the beach
without me or your mom.

816
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:51,828
- But...
- Strictly forbidden.

817
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,788
There's too many leeches
down there.

818
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,291
<i>The last time we went
down, there was no leeches.</i>

819
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,293
<i>Of course not,
'cause I was there.</i>

820
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,211
<i> And they're scared of me.</i>

821
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,464
<i>Oh, you didn't notice?</i>

822
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:05,216
<i>Every time we go down there, I'd
just, like, scare them away.</i>

823
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,635
<i>- How?</i>
<i>- With my...</i>

824
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,513
<i>burping superpower.</i>

825
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,977
<i>- Do you want to know a secret?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

826
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:20,065
<i>My superpower-- I
actually get it from Mom.</i>

827
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,733
<i> No.</i>

828
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,401
<i>You don't believe me?</i>

829
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:24,694
<i>What did we have</i>
<i>for dinner tonight</i>

830
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,362
<i>with the--</i>
<i>with the steak?</i>

831
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:29,866
<i>Um, Mom's spinach salad?</i>

832
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,493
<i>Mom's spinach salad.</i>

833
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:37,749
<i>Top secret, okay?</i>

834
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,923
"G is for George,
smothered under a rug.

835
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:48,551
H is for Hector,
done in by a thug."

836
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:55,975
You startled me.

837
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,519
I'm sorry.

838
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:02,816
- Wow, these are great.
- Mm-hmm.

839
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:06,277
- Hmm?
- Aw.

840
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,779
Hey, the boys
mentioned something

841
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:10,240
about a little girl
getting hurt today.

842
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,075
Mmm.

843
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,160
Renata Klein's
daughter.

844
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:17,914
She wasn't really
injured, she was just...

845
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,791
Oh, look at this.

846
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:22,043
- Could they be cuter?
- Oh...

847
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,962
I actually think
this is my favorite.

848
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,588
- I love your finger.
- Stop.

849
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:27,465
- Post it.
<i>-  All right.</i>

850
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,635
People are gonna love it.

851
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,555
Well, so what happened
with that girl?

852
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,890
A boy tried
to choke her.

853
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,936
<i> Are you serious?</i>

854
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,231
Well, no one witnessed it,
but she was pretty distraught.

855
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,483
She had marks
on her neck.

856
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:47,318
Which boy?

857
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:51,364
Oh, this new boy,
Ziggy.

858
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:56,035
I mean, he seemed
really sweet, and...

859
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,122
I met his mom and she
couldn't be nicer, so...

860
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,374
Yeah?

861
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:03,418
Well, to be safe,
we should tell Josh and Max

862
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,545
to keep their distance
from him.

863
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:07,172
I don't think that's
gonna be necessary.

864
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,090
Honey, if the kid
is violent--

865
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,800
No, he's not violent.

866
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:12,677
How do you know
he's not violent?

867
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,263
<i>What, because</i>
<i>he seemed sweet?</i>

868
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:22,270
- First off, he could be innocent.
- Or he could be guilty.

869
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,689
We don't want the boys to be getting
mixed up with the wrong crowd.

870
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:27,901
- They're six.
- They're not to associate with him.

871
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:34,949
You're being
ridiculous.

872
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:40,288
- - The boys
will stay away from that kid.

873
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,831
Take your hand off me.

874
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,666
If I can't be here
to look out for them,

875
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,835
I need to know
that you do.

876
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:49,756
I asked you to remove
your fucking hand.

877
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,809
Hmm.

878
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,853
<i>Is that a song
from your puppet show?</i>

879
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,692
Yes, but it's really more
than just a puppet show.

880
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:23,331
The play means a lot
to you, right?

881
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:29,796
I'll tell Bonnie
to start a new petition

882
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,339
in favor.

883
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,427
Mom, are you okay?

884
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,513
You're not, like, dying
or anything, are you?

885
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,433
No, I'm not dying.

886
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:43,851
What would make you
ask me that?

887
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:46,688
You seem
a little wobbly.

888
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,648
Are you having
one of your massive periods?

889
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:49,691
No.

890
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,527
No.

891
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:58,241
What people don't
tell you is that...

892
00:42:58,285 --> 00:42:59,867
you lose your children.

893
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:06,207
As beautiful and wonderful
as you are now,

894
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:09,544
the little girl whose curly
hair I used to detangle,

895
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,214
the one who had bad dreams
and would crawl into my bed,

896
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:14,882
she's gone.

897
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,763
And I guess that's why
I'm feeling a little bit...

898
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:25,226
Compounded by the fact that your
little sister's going to first grade.

899
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:29,188
I'm losing my babies.

900
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:30,982
Which has been
clinically compared

901
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:33,401
to a massive period,
I think.

902
00:43:37,324 --> 00:43:39,073
I'll always be
your baby.

903
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:43,578
Bonnie's like
a friend, you know.

904
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,539
Maybe even a best friend
sometimes, but...

905
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:49,584
I'm your daughter
and you're my mother.

906
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,424
Mom, don't cry.

907
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:58,634
Don't do that.
Okay?

908
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,970
I'm sorry.

909
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:03,639
I'm sorry.

910
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:04,932
Just...

911
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,434
Mom...

912
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:09,979
Your hair-- no, get it
out of your beautiful face.

913
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:14,776
I can still call you
baby-cakes, can't I?

914
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,569
Not in public.

915
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:18,905
Okay.

916
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,656
Oh, no.

917
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,576
Not another one.
You go back to bed!

918
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,286
Uh-oh...

919
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,972
I love that song.

920
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,474
Do you want
to play it together?

921
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:00,738
We're treating the matter
as a homicide.

922
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:03,032
We have no suspects
as of yet.

923
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,811
<i>I will say
that we do believe</i>

924
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:35,857
we have spoken to the person
or persons involved.

925
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,947
Ziggy.

926
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,532
Oh, baby.

927
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:50,496
What are we doing?

928
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,832
You're sleepwalking
again, baby.

929
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,678
We're all gonna
do the interview?

930
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:07,013
<i>Right here?</i>

931
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,182
<i>I'll just put my purse</i>
<i>down here.</i>

932
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,102
<i>The first thing I said--</i>

933
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:14,520
<i>"It wasn't</i>
<i>just the mothers."</i>

934
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:16,939
<i>It was the dads, too.</i>

935
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,442
<i>- Thing about fundraisers...</i>
<i>- They're vicious.</i>

936
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:22,403
<i>It's not the male grizzlies
you gotta watch out for.</i>

937

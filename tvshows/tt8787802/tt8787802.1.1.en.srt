2
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,079
<i>How you feeling, Emma?</i>

3
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,705
Uh, repairs are underway.

4
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm confident the ship will be good to go
and will remain on schedule.

5
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:28,004
<i>That's... that's great,
but I asked about you, not the ship.</i>

6
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,048
I already debriefed with Darlene.

7
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,883
<i>Emma, I'm asking how you're feeling</i>

8
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,843
<i>about what happened
on the way to the Moon.</i>

9
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:37,972
Squared away.

10
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,975
<i>It's natural to second-guess
your response to a crisis.</i>

11
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,061
Who called it a crisis?

12
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,646
<i>What would you call it?</i>

13
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,356
There was a problem. We dealt with it.

14
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,152
Look, um...
no disrespect, Putney,

15
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,530
but I've got a checklist
as long as my arm to get through

16
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,823
before tomorrow's launch, so...

17
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,949
<i>And you feel ready?</i>

18
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,619
Good to go.

19
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,081
{\an8}- How much time?
- About 30 seconds. Let's go!

20
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,415
- Yes!
- There you go.

21
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,460
- Okay, yeah.
- Let's go! Pass it!

22
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,130
- Come on! Come on!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

23
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,215
Let's go! Let's go!

24
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,758
- You got it! Pass!
- Pass!

25
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,426
- Come on, Lex!
- Come on!

26
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,387
- Let's go, Lex! You got it!
- You got it!

27
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,013
- Go!
- Take the shot, Lex!

28
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,099
- Take the shot, Lex!
- Lex, take it! Take it!

29
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,017
- Take the shot!
- Go! Go!

30
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,102
Here!

31
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,812
What?

32
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,193
It's all right. It was a good game!

33
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,196
- You were eating that girl's lunch.
- I know.

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,782
- It's just that you had it, you know?
- She was wide open!

35
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,451
Yeah, but you gotta be the one
that wants to take the shot!

36
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,620
Guys, let's discuss
the post-game analysis later.

37
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,705
Right this way.

38
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,999
Hi.

39
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,878
Hey, Matt.

40
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:53,923
It's your ball, Em.

41
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,050
Take the shot.

42
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,889
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

43
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,391
<i>one last time
before they launch to the Moon,</i>

44
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,603
<i>the crew of the Atlas,
our inaugural mission to Mars.</i>

45
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,377
<i>This mission is billed</i>
<i>as an international collaboration,</i>

46
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,964
yet the official language is English,
the commander is American...

47
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:39,302
Look, I mean, it's not a secret, right,
that the United States have taken on

48
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,722
the greatest financial burden
of all five nations, but, uh...

49
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,265
you know, Emma's our commander

50
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,644
because she is
the most phenomenal astronaut and leader.

51
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,938
Cosmonaut Popov,

52
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,316
you have logged more time in space
than anybody else alive.

53
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:57,654
How do you feel about taking orders
from someone younger and less experienced?

54
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,364
Well, uh...

55
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,075
when you put it like that...

56
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,621
No, no, no. I'm staying. I'm staying.

57
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,167
Or conversely, Kwesi Weisberg-Abban.

58
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,044
- Yes?
- You'll be the only one

59
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,505
up there
with absolutely no experience in space.

60
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,173
Yes, but...

61
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,508
perhaps what I <i>can</i> bring,

62
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,887
the hope of growing life on Mars,
will make up for what I lack.

63
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,891
Kwesi's being modest. He happens to be
one of the world's leading botanists.

64
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,687
And, uh, Dr. Wang
is among her nation's finest chemists.

65
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,232
We've all trained together for two years,

66
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,277
and I have absolute confidence
in every member of this crew.

67
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:42,282
Except for maybe Ram, who is an expert
at crashing experimental air force jets.

68
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,659
But he promises to do better
with the Atlas.

69
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,828
Spoken like a true navy pilot.

70
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,997
I didn't even know these guys had planes.

71
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,749
Dr. Wang, it has been determined

72
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,377
that you will be the first person
to set foot on Mars.

73
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,838
As your fellow countryman, I am elated.

74
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,757
Can you tell the people of China
how you feel?

75
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,511
Yes, I'm elated.

76
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,431
How about your family?

77
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,808
It's an honor to represent my family,

78
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,393
my country,

79
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,353
and the world.

80
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,984
Don't worry. When she opens up,
she doesn't stop talking.

81
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,779
And, Emma, how about your family?

82
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,324
How do they feel
about you leaving them for three years?

83
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,329
My husband has been in this with me
every step of the way.

84
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,748
We both trained to be astronauts,

85
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,335
and if it were not for health reasons,
he might be the one going up.

86
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,213
Instead, as chief engineer of our rocket,

87
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,591
he'll be with us in Mission Control.

88
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:47,555
A recent study predicts a 50-50 chance
you won't survive this mission.

89
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,015
- How, then, do you...
- What?

90
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,601
Wait, is it too late to change my mind?

91
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,228
How, then, do you respond to critics

92
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,230
who say that the money spent
on this mission

93
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,025
could be better spent
on social imperatives here on Earth?

94
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,610
Education, health care...

95
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,822
Why should we care more about Mars
than we do our own planet?

96
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,909
We shouldn't.

97
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,746
Of course we should care
about social imperatives.

98
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:12,955
But in the US alone,

99
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,459
we spend a trillion dollars each year
on the military,

100
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,295
and mostly in case
the countries represented here

101
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,964
decide to blow each other
off the face of the Earth.

102
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,218
This mission, it cost a fraction of that,

103
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,844
as we work together,

104
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,223
repurposing those same tools
of destruction for discovery.

105
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:34,227
At this very moment, there's a team
of astronauts on the Moon,

106
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,604
mining polar ice caps for fuel and water.

107
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,190
Water that will be pumped
into the hull of our ship

108
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,775
to shield us from radiation,

109
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,237
allowing us to travel safely
from the Moon to Mars.

110
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,114
Reaching Mars...

111
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,701
might prove to be
the greatest achievement.

112
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:56,082
Not only for science
but for the future of our planet.

113
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,793
And not to mention one hell of a ride.

114
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,592
Isn't this fancy? Who did this?

115
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,687
You don't have to put that away.

116
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,606
No homework at dinner.

117
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,608
No cell phone at dinner. Nice try though.

118
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,236
Here's a math question for you.

119
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,404
Okay.

120
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,740
Is there really a 50-50 chance you'll die?

121
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,663
Lex, journalists...

122
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,707
they just need to be provocative.
They're trying...

123
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,252
Honey, I'm gonna be working
with people like your dad.

124
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,754
You know, the smartest...

125
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,674
engineers and scientists in the world.

126
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,345
Yes, there are risks with the job.
I mean, space is...

127
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,555
I'm not gonna let anything happen
to your mom, sweetie.

128
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,850
I know every inch of that ship,
and I'm gonna be right there.

129
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,770
Mission Control isn't right there.

130
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,359
You're right. It isn't.

131
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,070
And, um...

132
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,240
there is always a chance that, you know,

133
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,909
that I don't make it.

134
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,055
Hey.

135
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,688
Do you wanna talk any more about...

136
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,647
No.

137
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,190
If that's okay?

138
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,733
Yeah.

139
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,735
Yeah, of course it's okay.

140
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,159
Hey... I got you a present.

141
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,419
That's the Earth,

142
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,129
the Moon,

143
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:49,714
and Mars.

144
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,674
And the string...

145
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,052
is me making my way back to you.

146
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,518
So, just remember...

147
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,812
the further away I get,

148
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,190
I'm actually just getting closer
to being back to you.

149
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,793
I couldn't lie to her.

150
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,213
You did what you felt was right.

151
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,632
No.

152
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,885
She's gonna continue to hear things
from other people,

153
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,138
and I'd just rather her hear them from us.

154
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,810
And you know the risks more than anyone.

155
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,856
You know, I'd still go in a heartbeat
if the docs would let me.

156
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,028
And you <i>will </i>make it home.

157
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,825
I know this
because you are a phenomenal astronaut.

158
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,578
I knew it the first moment
I saw you in that T-38.

159
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,624
You were fangs out all the way.

160
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,753
You always were a sucker for a fast girl.

161
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,088
Hmm.

162
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,719
Every time you've launched
has been the worst day of my life.

163
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,972
I'm standing there...

164
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,393
watching everyone cheering,
waving their flags,

165
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,689
and me knowing, in about five minutes...

166
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,692
the person I love...

167
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,445
who is my life...

168
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,323
could be blown to pieces.

169
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,702
So, no.

170
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,955
I don't want our daughter
to think about that.

171
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,667
I just want her to stand there, cheering,

172
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,920
talking about her mom,
who's a freakin' hero.

173
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,299
And who'll be home soon.

174
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,799
Don't go.

175
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,677
I'll be right back.

176
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,887
It's only three years.

177
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,890
Mm-hmm.
Okay, I guess I won't miss you then.

178
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,809
Fine.

179
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,436
I won't miss you either.

180
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,232
I love you, shithead.

181
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,360
I love you more.

182
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,338
<i>Welcome to Lunar Base Alpha, Emma.</i>
<i>How's the view?</i>

183
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,800
<i>Commander Green?</i>

184
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,385
Sorry, Houston.

185
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,679
I just...

186
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,600
I wish I had the words
to describe what I'm seeing.

187
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,479
It's a hell of a privilege to be up here.

188
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,774
<i>We can't imagine</i>
<i>a better person for this job.</i>

189
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,257
Matt.

190
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,387
What's the sitrep on our little mishap?

191
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,723
Is it a one-time thing
or do we have a real problem?

192
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,517
We've been at it all night.
We should have an answer within the hour.

193
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,019
How's she sound?

194
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,104
She's fine. She's good.

195
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,440
What about you? Get any sleep?

196
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,942
Hundred percent.

197
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,401
Same with the ship, I hope?

198
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,656
Every mission has a screw-up, Darlene.
They just got theirs out of the way early.

199
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,782
Mmm.

200
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,076
How we doing?

201
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,119
Darlene wants an update.

202
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,623
<i>Uh, looking good.</i>
<i>In 24 hours, we will be go for launch.</i>

203
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,584
There's no better word
in the English language than "go."

204
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,211
Darlene is happy.

205
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,296
<i>I live to make Darlene happy.</i>

206
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,131
- Tell her to head on inside.
- Mmm.

207
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,592
<i>Atlas, you are good to report to base.</i>

208
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,677
Copy.

209
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,155
So, you're saying it wasn't just smoke
but an honest-to-God fire on board?

210
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,908
Jack, another 30 seconds,
we are all barbecue.

211
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,077
Misha, why are you being so dramatic?

212
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,162
I'm dramatic?

213
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:19,830
Lu?

214
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,917
- We would be dead.
- Thank you very much.

215
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,017
Here's what happened...

216
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,436
Commander,
welcome to one-sixth gravity.

217
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,439
- Where's Kwesi?
- He's, uh... He's still adapting.

218
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:51,195
Kwesi has a... delicate constitution.

219
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,115
Oh.

220
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,992
Apologies.

221
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,204
Apparently,
I'm a better scientist than astronaut.

222
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,040
You'll adjust.
Gravitational change affects everyone.

223
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,124
Not me.

224
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,752
I felt great my first time up.

225
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,921
Well, clearly,
you're the king of space...

226
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,090
and have an enormous dick.

227
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,508
Guilty.

228
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,592
On both counts.

229
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,722
Commander Green,
can I give you a hand?

230
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,057
No, I got it.

231
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,810
- Hell of an operation you got here, Jack.
- Well, we're doing our best.

232
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,771
You know, being a gas station on the Moon
is not as cool as going to Mars,

233
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,315
but when you're a lowly backup,
you know, you do what you can.

234
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,566
Yeah.

235
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,318
Uh, Kwesi.

236
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,239
As soon as you're feeling up to it,
start loading MREs onto the ship.

237
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,156
Aye, Commander.

238
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,701
Mission Control
wants to debrief each of us individually.

239
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,120
Ram, you're first up.

240
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,830
Misha, Lu,

241
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:47,751
I need you to assess any damage
to the ship after last night's incident.

242
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:51,755
Yes?

243
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,799
Nothing...

244
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,135
Commander.

245
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,597
<i>You're saying
you weren't there when it happened?</i>

246
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,391
I was in the command module.

247
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,643
I was confirming
our coordinates for landing,

248
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,855
and by the time I unstrapped
and arrived on scene, it was over.

249
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,608
<i>Well, what did you see when you arrived?</i>

250
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,195
Okay, steady. Steady!

251
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,364
Go!

252
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:24,288
Like I said, the leak had been contained,
and any potential danger was averted.

253
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,998
Nothing else?

254
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,207
<i>Nothing else.</i>

255
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,335
<i>Thank you for your time.</i>

256
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:33,922
Can I, um...

257
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,466
<i>Can I just say something?</i>

258
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,928
<i>You know,
I've seen Emma do things in training</i>

259
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,847
<i>that seemed superhuman.</i>

260
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,892
<i>I mean, for one,
she held her breath underwater</i>

261
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,810
<i>a full minute longer than any of us.</i>

262
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,854
<i>And when I asked her how she did it,</i>

263
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,232
<i>she said she imagined the scenario
the exercise was designed for,</i>

264
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:56,069
<i>which I think was a splashdown landing,
where one of us starts to drown.</i>

265
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,908
<i>Now, she held her breath that long
because that's the amount of time</i>

266
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,118
<i>it would have taken her
to rescue the crew.</i>

267
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,370
So, no.

268
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,957
No, I don't believe
she would ever put us in danger.

269
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,168
Or get rattled.

270
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,765
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

271
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,310
Hey, sweetheart. How was the game?

272
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,064
<i>Dominated! Four-zip. We kept them
in their half of the field the whole game.</i>

273
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,565
That's awesome.

274
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,610
I wish I could have been there to see it.

275
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,987
<i>You okay, Mom?</i>

276
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,448
<i>Yeah. Yeah, you bet.</i>

277
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,991
<i>Hey, is your dad around?</i>

278
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:47,287
Uh, he got pulled in for a shift.
Some NASA drama as usual.

279
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,455
Melissa's here.

280
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,791
Did you know she played Division I?

281
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,169
<i>Yeah, of course I knew. Why do you think
I picked her to be our crew support?</i>

282
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,047
<i>I figured if she could kick my butt,
she could kick yours.</i>

283
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,592
How's it going up there?

284
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,970
<i>Oh, guys...</i>

285
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,514
<i>you gotta check this out.</i>

286
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:19,903
Wow.

287
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,240
It's amazing, Emma.

288
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,118
You know you chose the right mission

289
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,577
when your pit stop is the Moon.

290
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,915
<i>So, Annie and I were...</i>

291
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,083
What's that, honey?

292
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,210
Can you hear me?

293
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,295
Honey, what?

294
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,172
Can you...

295
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,109
Oh.

296
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,072
Your debrief's confidential.
You don't have to tell me anything.

297
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,992
I told them the truth, Emma.
You saved my life.

298
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,746
- I appreciate you saying that.
- Excuse me.

299
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,504
Not sure everyone else's report
will be quite so glowing.

300
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,839
Uh...

301
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,303
<i>She froze.</i>

302
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,930
<i>As simple as that.</i>

303
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,060
I need to understand
exactly what happened

304
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,021
so we can identify any problem areas
with the ship or the crew...

305
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,482
<i>Excuse me. Excuse me.</i>
<i>The </i>ship<i> will be fine.</i>

306
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,942
Start at the beginning.

307
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:45,405
Lu and I were in the galley
when I noticed the alert.

308
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,746
Ay, ay, ay...

309
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,667
- What?
- Chemical leak! Fire bag, now!

310
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,767
Quickly.

311
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,275
<i> I attended to emergency.</i>

312
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,945
It was pre-treat,
the chemical we use to recycle...

313
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,322
Yeah, I... I know what pre-treat is.

314
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:31,743
Then you know it becomes like a firebomb
in an oxygen-rich ship.

315
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,286
- Agh!
- Kwesi.

316
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,580
Kwesi! Here!

317
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,458
I've got him, Lu. I got him. Get the bag!

318
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,045
Kwesi, hey! Hey! Look at me.
Look at me. Hold onto this.

319
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,882
<i>Now, pre-treat is acid.</i>
<i>To put out fire, you need water, yes.</i>

320
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,760
But lots of it. You must suffocate flames.

321
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,304
Oh God. Please, God, no.

322
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,848
<i>She didn't even move.</i>

323
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,935
Steady. Steady. Go!

324
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,022
An experienced astronaut
doesn't remove panel.

325
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:05,694
<i>It's because of Commander Green's
inexperience, we almost burned alive.</i>

326
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,448
<i>Now, Kwesi is new.
I expect nothing from him.</i>

327
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,408
<i>Commander Green...</i>

328
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,076
...not a good leader.

329
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,968
<i>Misha and I were in the galley.</i>

330
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,804
<i>I told him what must be done
to suffocate the fire.</i>

331
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,556
The bag and towels were your idea?

332
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,725
Of course. I'm chemist.

333
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,685
Fire bag!

334
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,614
But before we could respond...

335
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,074
Wait!

336
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,912
You're saying Emma started the fire?

337
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,580
<i>Pre-treat is acid.</i>

338
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,291
<i>Whatever on that cloth was accelerant.</i>

339
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,543
<i>-If she had let me do my job-</i>-
-So...

340
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,796
So your issue
isn't that she failed to respond.

341
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,548
It's the opposite.

342
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,675
<i>My issue is that she was</i>

343
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,428
hysterical and reckless.

344
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,472
<i>We've got a situation.</i>

345
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,807
You don't think I'm aware of that?

346
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,519
Misha and Lu talked to their directors.

347
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,895
The Chinese want her replaced.

348
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,606
The Russians would prefer she's shot.

349
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,982
I talked to both of them.

350
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,984
Their stories don't sync up.

351
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:32,614
Meanwhile, Kwesi says she saved them all,
and Ram is sure she was solid.

352
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,033
- Even if he wasn't there.
- Darlene...

353
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,744
they want her gone.

354
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,956
- You're not seriously...
- I told them I'd think about it.

355
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,208
- George...
- We do have a trained backup on the Moon.

356
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,460
Jack Willmore is not...

357
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,756
Look, there is a reason
we chose Emma over him.

358
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,175
I am not starting
an international incident.

359
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:56,179
And I am not replacing our commander
24 hours before launch.

360
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,394
You wanted an update on the leak?

361
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,984
We figured out a patch
and sent Misha the procedure.

362
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,152
Excellent.

363
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,951
How can you even contemplate...

364
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:18,994
- Matt...
- This...

365
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,621
is Emma's mission.

366
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,749
And it's gonna stay that way.
Right now, I need you to go home.

367
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,294
You haven't slept in 24 hours.
You look like shit.

368
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,421
I need you fresh for tomorrow's launch.

369
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,048
And I need you to nip this in the bud.

370
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,133
I will.

371
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,117
<i>Look, um, no disrespect, Putney,</i>

372
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,411
<i>but I've got a checklist
as long as my arm to get through</i>

373
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,622
- before tomorrow's launch, so...
<i>- And you feel ready?</i>

374
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:05,749
Good to go.

375
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,043
<i>How's the crew?</i>

376
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,297
There's some dissension.
Um, you know, Misha...

377
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:16,384
<i>He can be a dick,
but I've got that under control, I think.</i>

378
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,553
Wait. Talk about the dissension.

379
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,263
<i>Ram's okay.</i>

380
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:24,559
<i>And Kwesi's having some trouble
adjusting, but, um...</i>

381
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,145
- Misha and Lu are...
<i>- Blame you.</i>

382
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,691
Yeah. I can only imagine
what they said about me.

383
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,653
<i>- What do you think they said?</i>
- That I'm a...

384
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,323
shrill, cowardly bitch.

385
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,576
<i>Look, I know what's going on here.</i>

386
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,287
<i>You're supposed to determine
whether I'm fit to lead.</i>

387
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,206
Are you?

388
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:56,716
Hey, baby.

389
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,136
Hey, so tomorrow night,
for the Mars launch party,

390
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,471
I know you have to work,

391
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,099
but can I have your credit card
for ordering the pizza?

392
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,518
Salvatore's already has the order,
but nice try though.

393
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:11,189
So, I can't decide which picture to post
on my Instagram for the invitations.

394
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,109
There's that one of me and Mom
on horseback from last summer.

395
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,404
Annie says I look really hot
in the one on the beach, but I don't know.

396
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,988
I think I look kinda fat.

397
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,574
Oh my God. My phone is blowing up.

398
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:25,161
I have, like, a million followers
since Mom became, like, this superstar.

399
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,580
Would you guys be weirded out
if I became...

400
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,208
- Honey...
- Dad!

401
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,669
Dad!

402
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,768
I asked him to help.

403
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,896
I've only been in that sweaty simulator.
Wanna get a taste of the real thing.

404
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,858
- I assume you can patch a leak?
- Yeah, apparently, better than you.

405
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,943
I'll take it.

406
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,701
No need for you to go out
if you're not feeling up to it.

407
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,245
I promise not to throw up
on the command console.

408
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,830
Emma, it's Ground.

409
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,498
Melissa's on the line.

410
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,751
My crew support Melissa?

411
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,847
Melissa, what's wrong?

412
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:30,310
<i>An hour ago, Matt had an event.
We think it was a stroke.</i>

413
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,979
<i>He had to be intubated,
and he's still critical.</i>

414
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:35,857
Oh my God.

415
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,485
Did one of his cavernomas bleed?

416
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,905
<i>That's what the doctors believe.</i>
<i>He's getting an MRI now.</i>

417
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,823
Where's Lex? Does she know?

418
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:48,161
<i>She was there when it happened.
It was Lex who called 911.</i>

419
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:51,164
- Okay, I need to speak to her.
<i>- She's in the ICU.</i>

420
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,417
<i>They don't allow video calls in there,
but I'll set you guys up to talk.</i>

421
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:55,960
Um...

422
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,463
Was he conscious when they found him?

423
00:29:58,922 --> 00:29:59,798
<i>Yes.</i>

424
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,257
Oh, that's good.

425
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,885
Do they know if there's any damage?

426
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,138
<i>It's too soon to know anything.</i>

427
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:18,817
I want that link set up to Lex in the ICU,
I wanna speak to Matt's doctors,

428
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,026
and I want the private number

429
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,403
to the head of vascular neurology
at Baylor.

430
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,280
<i>I'm on it.</i>

431
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,171
Hello.

432
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,841
- <i>Dr. Lawrence Madigan?</i>
- Speaking.

433
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,718
<i>This is Commander Emma Green
of Lunar Base Alpha.</i>

434
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,680
<i>A car will be by shortly
to transport you to Houston Methodist.</i>

435
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,682
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Excuse me.

436
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,351
Uh, who is this?
How did you get this number?

437
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:57,647
I'm sorry. I'm calling from the Moon.
I'm part of the Atlas mission to Mars.

438
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,274
I'm... I'm... I'm on the Moon.

439
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,610
<i>My husband, Matt Logan,
a NASA engineer at Mission Control,</i>

440
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,030
he has CCM disorder with multiple lesions,
and he's just had a stroke.

441
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,323
<i>Atlas, this is Houston.</i>

442
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,076
- I... I'm sorry. Could you just...
<i>- Just hold on a sec.</i>

443
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,911
Houston, Atlas, over.

444
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,163
<i>Lex is set up to talk in the ICU.</i>

445
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,458
<i>We couldn't set up the visual,
but our audio is up and running.</i>

446
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,459
Great. One sec.

447
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,546
Matt's doctor, he'll meet you
at the hospital and brief you on his case.

448
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,131
- Do you understand?
<i>- Yes.</i>

449
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,383
<i>Great. I'll check in with you soon, okay?</i>

450
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,510
Can you please put them through
to my phone?

451
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,096
- <i>Emma, I'm so sorry.</i>
- Thank you.

452
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,809
- <i>Mom?</i>
- Hi. Hey, baby.

453
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,021
I'm right here.
I'm... I'm... I'm right here.

454
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,815
- They said he had a stroke.
- <i>I know, honey.</i>

455
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,734
You don't understand.
He was fine one second,

456
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,612
and the next,
he was on the ground and he couldn't move.

457
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,615
<i>Mom, you're not still going, are you?</i>

458
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,242
I, um...

459
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,746
Uh, nothing like this
has ever happened before.

460
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,539
Mama, I don't care.

461
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,791
Dad has tubes coming out of him.

462
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,960
I know you're scared.

463
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,672
I'm scared too. I just need, um...

464
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,591
I just need a minute
to figure things out, okay?

465
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,676
<i>- Mom, he's going into surgery!</i>
- Now?

466
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,761
No, I...

467
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,097
I don't know when.
They're waiting for some doctor.

468
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,516
<i>They found this lesion or something.</i>

469
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,645
<i>It's not bleeding anymore,
but they wanna operate.</i>

470
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,772
Okay, um...

471
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,149
Okay, listen to me.

472
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,194
<i>Mom, I need you here.</i>

473
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,198
I know, baby, and, um...

474
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,576
I wanna be there.
I wanna be there more than anything,

475
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,244
but I can't be right now.

476
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,788
So I need you...

477
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,708
to be strong, stronger
than you've ever been in your life.

478
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,335
Okay?

479
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,756
<i>I love you.</i>

480
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:51,344
<i>You and your father mean everything to me,
and I'm gonna be there for you, okay?</i>

481
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,471
Okay.

482
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,764
<i>Can you please, um...</i>

483
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,850
<i>Put the SATCOM over near your dad?</i>

484
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,448
Here. Here's Dad.

485
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,618
<i>Matt?</i>

486
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,039
I don't know if you can hear me, my love.

487
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,585
The doctors don't think
that you're able, but...

488
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:30,675
...you know, personally,
I think you're doing that thing where...

489
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,679
you, um, you pretend
not to hear me and then...

490
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,764
<i>you wait till I get annoyed</i>

491
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,934
<i>and you recite back word for word
everything I just said.</i>

492
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,858
<i>I'm sure you just want me to shut up now
so you can concentrate on getting better.</i>

493
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,193
<i>Um...</i>

494
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:50,945
<i>Hold on a sec.</i>

495
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,726
<i>Excuse me, honey.</i>
<i>We need to take him now.</i>

496
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,311
<i>Mom, they're...</i>

497
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,646
They're taking Dad now.

498
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,903
You got this, Matt.

499
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,240
<i>Do you hear me? You got this.</i>

500
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,589
Oh, it's bad. Really bad.

501
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,466
- Look at the gasket.
- Nice.

502
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,968
We've already seen
how she reacts in an emergency.

503
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,262
How's she gonna command now,
under this kind of stress?

504
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,224
- We need a real commander.
- Oh, you mean like you, for instance?

505
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,351
Why not? 'Cause I'm Russian?

506
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,311
No, because you're not in line to command.

507
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,604
Well, he is.

508
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:10,149
The Americans were wrong
to pick Emma over you, Jack.

509
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,984
- Well...
- It's not too late.

510
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,236
I'm sorry?

511
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,280
We can call Ground,
tell them we have full confidence in Jack.

512
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,324
I... I did train for this, but...

513
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,451
So, you're talking mutiny.

514
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,994
Who's dramatic now?

515
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:25,414
Can we take a moment to have some empathy?
Her husband just had a stroke.

516
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,792
Exactly.
She needs to go back home...

517
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,799
We're 20 hours from launch
and behind schedule.

518
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,677
I want that system repaired
within the hour.

519
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,849
Fine. I will give Houston progress report.

520
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,684
No, you won't.

521
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,186
I'll debrief Houston...

522
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,272
and relay any updates.

523
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,943
That is all.

524
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,654
Language.

525
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,224
<i>He should be out of surgery</i>
<i>in a couple hours.</i>

526
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,685
<i>Matt's a fighter.</i>
<i>He's gonna be okay.</i>

527
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,437
In the event he's not,

528
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,023
you should be prepared
to issue a transfer of command.

529
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,483
- <i>Emma</i>...
- Jack Willmore has the same training I do.

530
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,736
<i>- He's completely qualified.</i>
- Yes, he is.

531
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:41,073
He's also happy to take advantage
of your personal crisis to take your seat.

532
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,910
That's not the person
I want leading this mission.

533
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,244
Tell that to the crew.

534
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,997
<i>-Wa... wait. No. If this is about Misha-</i>-
-It's not.

535
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,166
<i>- And... and what happened aboard...</i>
- It's not.

536
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,126
It's about Matt.

537
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,674
<i>You knew taking this job
demands terrible sacrifices,</i>

538
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,302
<i>and I need you to remember it's worth it.</i>

539
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,263
<i>No astronaut has ever abandoned a mission.</i>

540
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,099
You will be spitting in the face
of every woman who has ever...

541
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,477
<i>You're talking feminist bullshit?</i>

542
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,687
<i>My husband just had a stroke.</i>

543
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,274
My daughter's terrified.
My family needs me, Darlene!

544
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,904
I'll be in touch
when we know something definitive.

545
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,311
You like that? You like that?

546
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,397
Did you like playing the piano?

547
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,107
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

548
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,191
How'd it go?

549
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,985
Oh, it went okay.

550
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,446
- You know you aced it.
- Hi, honey.

551
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,241
No, they had me doing
parabolic puke spins all day

552
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,035
until my head was spinning so bad
I could barely get the spacesuit on,

553
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,037
let alone tread water for ten minutes.

554
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,873
My honey pie, sugar pie, honeybunch.

555
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,085
Maybe you and I'll just stay home and...

556
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,089
bake cookies and read storybooks
while Daddy goes to Mars.

557
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,465
Not in this lifetime.

558
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,760
What is it?

559
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:28,889
I'm out.

560
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,558
What?

561
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,312
I tested positive for CCM.

562
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,857
Apparently, I do have my dad's bad gene.

563
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,570
But he didn't know he had it
until last month,

564
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,614
and he didn't show any signs
until he was well into his seventies.

565
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,616
I know. NASA won't take the risk.

566
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,624
But it's not fair.

567
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,753
I'm sorry. God, you're the best.

568
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,130
Well, now you're the best.

569
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,217
Hey.

570
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,348
You just have to do this
for both of us now, okay?

571
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,901
<i>We are less than 24...</i>
<i>Would you please calm down?</i>

572
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,904
We are 24 hours away from launch.
There is no turning back.

573
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,865
- We must come to some sort of resolution.
- It would be a disaster

574
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,201
to change the game plan at this stage.

575
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,411
You don't think you're being unreasonable?

576
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,501
- She's saying...
- Yes, thanks. I got the gist.

577
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,419
- I need to talk to you.
- One minute.

578
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,046
I know you're worried,

579
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,548
but I promise you,
there is no one more capable

580
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,301
nor more committed to your astronauts
than Emma Green.

581
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,970
I need to speak with you, now.

582
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,265
Would you excuse me?

583
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,857
You can't be serious.

584
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,276
If the people on the other side
of this wall...

585
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:08,531
I'm about to get on the phone and assure
the president we are still on track.

586
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,990
I wanna say I can fix this,

587
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,326
but I'm honestly not confident
she's 100 percent.

588
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,036
Okay, let me think.

589
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,205
All right. I want Putney to evaluate her,

590
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,124
I want the full prognosis
from that surgery,

591
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,292
and I don't want anyone else
to know about any of this.

592
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,377
Roger that.

593
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,464
<i>I assume</i>
<i>you've spoken with Darlene.</i>

594
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,050
- <i>And George.</i>
- They want you to convince me.

595
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,718
<i>They want my evaluation,</i>

596
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,929
<i>but I'm not here for them, Emma.
I'm here for you.</i>

597
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,681
Mm-hmm.

598
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,725
<i>Believe it or not,
I want what's best for you.</i>

599
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,727
How can you know what's best for me?

600
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,564
I don't know what's best for me.

601
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:43,774
I mean...

602
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,653
The only thing I've ever known for sure
in my life

603
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,822
is that I wanted to be
on the first mission to Mars.

604
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,782
And now you will.

605
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,409
<i>With a husband who's critical,</i>

606
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,535
a daughter I abandoned,

607
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,370
and a crew that thinks
I tried to kill them.

608
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,705
Emma...

609
00:40:58,747 --> 00:40:59,748
what happened?

610
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,667
<i>Just tell me.</i>

611
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,381
<i>Everything was going great.</i>

612
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,342
<i>The crew was settling in.</i>

613
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,554
<i>They were starting
to really enjoy themselves.</i>

614
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,515
Cristiano!

615
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,059
And a save!

616
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,687
<i>I mean, the ship was flying itself.</i>

617
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,610
<i>Misha was as happy</i>
<i>as I'd ever seen him.</i>

618
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,779
<i>Lu was a natural in space.</i>

619
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,202
<i>Even Kwesi
had started to get his sea legs.</i>

620
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,163
<i>Then what?</i>

621
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:42,708
We were less than ten hours
from touching down.

622
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,595
This is Commander Green.
Chemical leak in the berth passageway.

623
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,618
Kwesi, wait!

624
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,333
- I'm here. I'm taking your arm.
- Emma?

625
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,460
- I... I can't see.
- I'm bringing you up.

626
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,672
- Kwesi.
- I can't see.

627
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,215
Kwesi! I got him, Lu.

628
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,801
- Up! Up!
- Get the fire extinguisher!

629
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,053
No! Water! Quickly, now!

630
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,306
Fire is the sum of all fears in space.

631
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,350
<i>I didn't think there was time to wait.</i>

632
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:54,238
It turns out
there's a chemical anomaly I didn't know.

633
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,158
Sweat from my shirt ignited the pre-treat.

634
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,080
<i>Misha and Lu knew
only a lot of water would put it out.</i>

635
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,623
Steady. Steady.

636
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,208
<i>And they were right.</i>

637
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,377
Okay, steady. Steady.

638
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,421
Go!

639
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,090
<i>It was over in seconds.</i>

640
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,592
<i>Like magic.</i>

641
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,888
<i>I was reckless and impulsive.</i>

642
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,224
It wasn't my area of expertise.

643
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,060
- And I had no business trying to...
<i>- Trying to save them?</i>

644
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:29,565
No, I escalated the crisis.
I could've killed everyone on board.

645
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,151
<i>That was me at the top of my game.</i>

646
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:36,155
How am I gonna function now
with all this shit going on?

647
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,450
<i>Here's what I see. You reacted quickly.</i>

648
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,785
<i>You pulled your crewmate
out of harm's way.</i>

649
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,288
You acted as a commander should

650
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:48,167
<i>and moved toward danger
without any thought of your own safety.</i>

651
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,044
You threw yourself at the problem.

652
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,295
But I didn't fix it.

653
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,131
<i>Like you couldn't cure your mom's cancer.</i>

654
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,717
<i>Like you can't cure Matt's CCM.</i>

655
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,845
What's your point?

656
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,264
That you're human.

657
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,561
<i>I'd want you leading my team
if the shit hit the fan, Emma.</i>

658
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,814
<i>But in the end,</i>

659
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,858
<i>this is your decision.</i>

660
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,194
<i>No one can make it for you.</i>

661
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,117
<i>Tell us some of the challenges</i>

662
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,285
<i>facing the astronauts</i>

663
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,288
{\an8}<i>on this eight-month-long journey to Mars.</i>

664
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,333
{\an8}<i>It's a long time.
I think the biggest challenge is gonna be</i>

665
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,211
{\an8}<i>that they're really gonna be,
no kidding, away.</i>

666
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:35,089
<i>And that means away from our planet,
away from their family...</i>

667
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:39,093
You trained to be one of them,
but you decided not to go, right?

668
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:42,805
Right.

669
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:44,598
Why?

670
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,060
It's complicated.

671
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,899
Okay, I know you're supposed to be,
like, my temporary mom,

672
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:57,361
but do you have to say everything
she says exactly like she says it?

673
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,114
Because when Mom says, "It's complicated,"

674
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,241
she really means
she just doesn't wanna talk about it.

675
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,159
Uh, well...

676
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,794
He's out of recovery.
The surgery went well.

677
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:15,963
Let's call your mom.

678
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,923
Can I talk to him?

679
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,718
He might be a little woozy,
but you can try.

680
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:23,679
Dad?

681
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,475
Emma,
I have Lexi and Matt for you.

682
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,643
<i>He's out of surgery?</i>

683
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,979
Yeah. He's good.

684
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,314
He's right here.

685
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:38,318
Commander Green, this is Dr. Madigan.
We were able to remove the lesion.

686
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,487
- Oh my God.
<i>- Matt is awake and responding.</i>

687
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,740
Do you know if, uh...

688
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,284
if the stroke caused any damage?
Is he gonna be okay?

689
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,035
<i>We're gonna run some tests soon.</i>

690
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,246
<i>It's too early
to know anything definitive.</i>

691
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,625
<i>Well, thank you.
Thank you so much, Doctor.</i>

692
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,130
Are you coming home?

693
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:05,471
Yes.

694
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,686
I'll leave you to talk privately.

695
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,689
Matt, I want you to get some rest.
I'll be back in the morning.

696
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,692
<i>Um, is Melissa there?</i>

697
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:19,985
Yeah, I'm here.

698
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,238
<i>You'll, uh...
You'll take Lex home with you tonight?</i>

699
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,032
Yeah, I got the guest room all set up.

700
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,452
<i>I'll see you in four days then.</i>

701
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,914
- I'll wait outside for you, Lex.
- Okay.

702
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,210
Mom?

703
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,421
Are they still gonna be able
to fly the mission without you?

704
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,965
Oh, don't worry about that, hon.

705
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:43,842
It's taken care of.

706
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,221
Dad, what's wrong?

707
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,722
<i>Honey, is something wrong?</i>

708
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:49,848
Dad, what is it?

709
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,975
Maybe you should call one of the nurses.

710
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,228
No, he...
He's trying to take off his mask.

711
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,563
I think he wants to talk to you.

712
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:02,986
<i>Matt?</i>

713
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:04,822
Honey?

714
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,449
I can't... I can't hear you.

715
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,995
He can only whisper,
so this is Dad, not me.

716
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,628
I miss you.

717
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,005
<i>I wanna see your face.</i>

718
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,008
<i>Dad?</i>

719
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,010
What?

720
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,430
<i>What?</i>

721
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,683
<i>What... what did he say?</i>

722
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,271
He said he needs you...

723
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:39,940
to do your job.

724
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,109
Matt, I made my decision.

725
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,786
<i>What's going on? Please tell me.
I can't hear anything.</i>

726
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,706
We're gonna be okay.

727
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,457
<i>Alexis?</i>

728
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,212
He says that...

729
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,757
that this is who you are.

730
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:09,928
And that someday,
I'm gonna be who I... I'm gonna be.

731
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,723
<i>And that he's gonna be okay.</i>

732
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,226
<i>And that he's gonna be okay,
and that we're gonna be okay.</i>

733
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:21,773
I need you...

734
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,028
to go.

735
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,112
Matt...

736
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,948
...you're not in a position...

737
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,909
It's not your decision.

738
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,828
- <i>It's not your decision either.</i>
- Matt...

739
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,413
<i>That wasn't Dad.</i>

740
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,416
That was me.

741
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,546
I'm with Dad. I think you should go too.

742
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,448
Okay.

743
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,627
Puppets?

744
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,921
Entertainment for grandchildren.

745
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,100
What is the ring?

746
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,774
Women hold up half the sky.

747
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,317
Hmm.

748
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,736
Gift from your husband?

749
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,366
From a friend.

750
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,995
You're bringing your Torah?

751
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,456
Yes, as a reminder of things I will miss.

752
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,084
To tether me to the Earth.

753
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:07,337
The things I'll miss,
I can't actually take with me.

754
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,463
Like what?

755
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:09,923
Sun,

756
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,968
oysters, uh, wine...

757
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,845
What else? Women.

758
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,931
- Hello.
- Gentlemen.

759
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,810
Long walks, uh... live music.

760
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:26,189
- I already mentioned women?
- Relax, boys. We have three years.

761
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,315
Come on, Misha.

762
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,609
- You know what I'll really miss the most?
- Women?

763
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,119
Status update?

764
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:42,956
System checks are all complete,
and, uh, we're back on schedule.

765
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,417
More importantly, how's your husband?

766
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,127
Doing well, thank you.

767
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,838
Kwesi, how you feeling?

768
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,340
Ready to go, Commander.

769
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:54,593
Lu, make sure everything's battened down
in the common room.

770
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,553
Misha, triple-check
every latch and drawer.

771
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,346
We start fueling in 15 minutes.

772
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,186
Something you guys wanna share?

773
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,521
No...

774
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,148
Commander.

775
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,902
I know you don't trust me.

776
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:16,156
But if we're gonna survive the launch,
much less the mission,

777
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,574
we need to figure it out.

778
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,910
You're right.

779
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,371
We don't trust you.

780
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,335
Well, then you better learn.

781
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,421
Emma, I forgot to say,

782
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,925
uh, Houston asked if you could say
a few words before launch.

783
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,134
To who?

784
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,136
To the world.

785
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:46,728
Say cheese, astronauts.

786
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,858
Live in five... four...

787
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,277
- What am I supposed to say?
- Three...

788
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,613
Just be you. One.

789
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:04,246
This is Commander Emma Green,
here on the Moon,

790
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,248
which is obvious.

791
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,793
But there are so many others
who can't be here,

792
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,628
<i>at home...</i>

793
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,547
<i>and around the world.</i>

794
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:18,552
<i>It's because of their work and sacrifices
that we are standing here today.</i>

795
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,305
<i>Getting to Mars</i>

796
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:26,518
<i>might be the hardest thing
that humankind has ever tried.</i>

797
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,522
<i>It requires...</i>

798
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,524
<i>the best of us...</i>

799
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,735
from all of us.

800
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,989
And maybe it's not our nature

801
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,699
to work together.

802
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:42,909
But the future

803
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,370
demands otherwise.

804
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,292
And we will come together now
in pursuit of a dream

805
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,587
that was once thought to be impossible.

806
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,092
<i>And if we can do this,</i>

807
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,555
<i>we can do anything.</i>

808
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,059
<i>We've been grimly reminded...</i>

809
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,772
<i>of the extraordinary challenges
that await us.</i>

810
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:19,237
<i>But we will reach the surface of Mars.</i>

811
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:21,907
<i>And </i>we<i> will...</i>

812
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:23,909
<i>return home.</i>

813
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,621

820
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:41,384
Confirming all systems go
for launch in T-minus ten...

821
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,221
<i>nine, eight...</i>

822
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:48,141
<i>seven, six, five...</i>

823
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,809
<i>Four...</i>

824
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,729
<i>We will return home.</i>

825
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,364
Go, you fucker.

826
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,408
Go.

826

{\an8}<i>How are you doing, Mumbai?</i>

3
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,235
Miss your beauty already.

4
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,237
That goes for the rest of my country too.

5
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,449
Well, it looks like
it's gonna be a smooth ride

6
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,910
thanks to our very awesome
Commander Emma Green.

7
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,038
Come, say hello to the people of India.

8
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,333
Okay, so...

9
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,753
Now for the question of the day.

10
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:49,549
This one comes from Aadav,
seven years old, of Calcutta.

11
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,802
<i>Hello from Atlas.</i>
<i>As most of you already know,</i>

12
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,013
<i>I was born in the Central Region of Ghana,</i>

13
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,475
a town called Apam,
just outside of the capital city of Accra.

14
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:03,104
And here we have planted the first seed
that will grow on the Red Planet,

15
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,231
in soil from my native land.

16
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,109
And behind me is what are...

17
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,613
Oh, sorry. I'm still trying to get used
to this zero-G thing.

18
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,407
Ah, there's my colleague, Misha.

19
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,202
Thank you, Misha, for laughing at me.

20
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,996
My pleasure. Anytime you need it, Kwesi.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,289
Right...

22
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,043
I guess these are the rites of passage
of being a rookie.

23
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,920
<i>I could not be more proud...</i>

24
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,547
<i>to be your husband right now.</i>

25
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,092
And I...

26
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,677
your wife.

27
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,055
Where is Lei?

28
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,269
<i>Come, your mother wants to say hi
before we have to go out there.</i>

29
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,187
<i>Hi, Mom!</i>

30
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,776
You look tired.

31
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,945
<i>It has been too exciting to sleep.</i>

32
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,780
<i>Everyone has so many questions.</i>

33
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,324
<i>I have to answer them all for you,
and the Motherland.</i>

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,912
But sleep is still important.

35
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,500
Um...

36
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,710
I have to go now.

37
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,504
<i>Good luck.</i>

38
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,465
Thank you.

39
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,020
<i>I am honored to speak to you</i>

40
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:31,484
<i>from the first hours
of the mission to Mars.</i>

41
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,810
So I saw
that extra credit you did for Mr. Crombie.

42
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,729
- Yeah.
- Nice!

43
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,028
It's good. I like him.

44
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,616
- Is it yummy?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,618
- Hey, Alexis.
- Hey.

46
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,286
- Come on in.
- Morning.

47
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,579
Morning!

48
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,372
You remember my daughter, Cassie?

49
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,291
You guys hung out a bit
when you were little.

50
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,337
I remember. I'm so excited you're here.
I always wanted a sister.

51
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,297
Uh, okay, take it slow, Cass.

52
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,759
- What can we get you for breakfast?
- We don't have sugar cereal.

53
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,553
Yeah, so sorry. Just the healthy stuff.

54
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,013
Are you okay with oatmeal?

55
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,308
I think I'll just eat something
at the hospital, if that's okay.

56
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,517
Wanna see my room?

57
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,645
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

58
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,772
But can we go soon?

59
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,274
Yeah, of course.
Let me go get my stuff together.

60
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,692
- Thanks.
- Yep.

61
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,152
Your mom's going to Mars?

62
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,322
- Yeah...
- My mom wanted to go too,

63
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,199
but then she had me.

64
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,457
Can you feel my hand?

65
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,375
Yes.

66
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,545
I can't believe
that's your wife up there.

67
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,005
Believe it.

68
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,716
How about now? Can you feel my hand?

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,555
No.

70
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,140
Now?

71
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,436
Is that bad?

72
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,232
Dr. Madigan will be in later
to go over your neuro vitals.

73
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,485
How about now?

74
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,533
<i>Negative return.</i>
<i>Flight course is on track.</i>

75
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,910
<i>Initiate gravitational systems.</i>

76
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,163
Partial solar panel separation, go.

77
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,633
<i>Water recycling system</i>
<i>fired up and working.</i>

78
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,720
Carbon and oxygen levels are good.

79
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,888
<i> Ready to make gravity happen?</i>

80
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,225
Yes, I am.
Let's deploy those sleeping pods.

81
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,984
<i>Centrifugal rotation, go.</i>

82
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,033
The crew quarters now have gravity.

83
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,286
All major systems are nominal.

84
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,457
Solar panels are warmed up
and ready to go.

85
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,210
Zarya array, go.

86
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,910
<i>Unity.</i>

87
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,286
Deploy Unity.

88
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,638
Deploy Zvezda.

89
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,181
Deploy Zvezda.

90
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,542
I'm getting a negative.

91
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,254
- Reboot.
- Reboot.

92
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,255
On it.

93
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,011
Come on. Come on. Come on.

94
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,909
I'm still getting a malfunction code.
CAPCOM, do you have different intel?

95
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,536
Commander Green wants some information.

96
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,329
We'll get back to her with next steps.

97
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,373
- And cut the live feed.
- Yes, sir.

98
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,546
<i>Zvezda didn't fully deploy.</i>

99
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,133
Ground is running scenarios
and will get back to us with next steps.

100
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,387
Are we sure the problem is mechanical?

101
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,556
At the moment, yes.

102
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,352
At the risk of Misha laughing at me again,
is it possible to get to Mars

103
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,062
with Zvezda only a quarter deployed?

104
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,983
If solar panel doesn't deploy fully,
rocket will lose power. We all die.

105
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,610
I don't see what is funny about that.

106
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:10,114
We must go outside and fix the problem.
Call Ground. Tell them we have no time...

107
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,074
No, we are not sending anyone outside

108
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,119
until we have absolute confirmation
that the problem is indeed mechanical.

109
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,204
It is mechanical.

110
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,747
- It's not happening.
- Really?

111
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:23,336
Well, Misha does have the most experience
in this area, so perhaps it is the time...

112
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,632
Ground will be getting back to us
with instructions. That's the end of it.

113
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,009
Yes, ma'am. Sure.

114
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,387
Let Ground run three hours
of useless scenarios,

115
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,598
then tell us we have to do spacewalk.

116
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,569
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey, babe.

117
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,030
- I need to talk to you.
- <i>What's wrong?</i>

118
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,156
Are you alone?

119
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,449
<i>Hello, Commander Green.</i>

120
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,700
Oh, hi...

121
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,245
Dr. Madigan. How are you?

122
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,455
Was just about to go over
Matt's neuro vitals.

123
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,707
<i>Oh. Well, good.
I'm glad that I can be here.</i>

124
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,545
Okay. So, first I just wanna say
that this early in the process,

125
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,797
future mobility is always an unknown.

126
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,924
<i>An unknown? What do you mean by unknown?</i>

127
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,385
The stroke
temporarily cut off blood supply

128
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,012
to the part of the brain
that controls the lower part of your body.

129
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,390
Your lower left side
was particularly compromised.

130
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,935
How compromised are we talking about?
Am I looking at mobility issues?

131
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,521
Now, we don't know what your cells'
ability to recover is yet.

132
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,567
Luckily, this hospital has one of the best
rehab facilities in the world.

133
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,278
<i>We'll get you transferred
and started on a full regimen</i>

134
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,113
<i>of physical and occupational therapy.</i>

135
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,322
How long will I be here, Doc?

136
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,408
I need to get back to work
as soon as possible.

137
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,536
I understand,
but the road to recovery can take time.

138
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,288
Uh, I'd think in terms of months.

139
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,583
You wanna get back
as much motor function as you can.

140
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,668
<i>This is the place to do it.</i>

141
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,840
<i>I know it's difficult, but you're young,
and you're in otherwise great health.</i>

142
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,760
More than any patient I've ever had,
you got what it takes,

143
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,762
both mentally and physically,
to get through this.

144
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,557
I don't know many astronauts,
and this is Texas.

145
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,351
I will talk to you tomorrow.
Call me anytime.

146
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,186
<i>- Thank you, Doctor.
- Bye, Commander.</i>

147
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,859
<i>Okay, so what the hell is happening
up there? They cut the live feed.</i>

148
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,776
Matt...

149
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,946
<i>We can talk about me later.
Tell me what's happening up there.</i>

150
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,491
There's gonna be some news coming out.

151
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,620
We're going to have to do an EVA.

152
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,872
I am shocked.

153
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,333
Misha and I will plan it out with Ground.

154
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,044
They hope to have us out at 1800 hours.

155
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,297
If we fail,
you know the contingency action plan.

156
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,923
What do you mean, if you fail?

157
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,551
Get your sea legs. Amateur hour is over.

158
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,894
<i>These solar panels are responsible
for all of the power on the ship.</i>

159
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,022
<i>Now, because of the scale of the Atlas,</i>

160
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,275
<i>three panels are necessary
to complete the mission.</i>

161
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,860
<i>Right now, as we speak,</i>

162
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,695
<i>Commander Green and Cosmonaut Popov</i>

163
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,947
<i>are getting ready
to go outside the ship to fix it.</i>

164
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,825
Misha's been in space
more than any astronaut in the world.

165
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,078
<i>Astronaut Hutch Fulton is with us now</i>

166
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:06,374
<i>to talk about the incredible risks
involved in tonight's spacewalk.</i>

167
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,959
<i>Hutch, what are the biggest concerns?</i>

168
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,672
<i>Yeah, so you're out there,
hanging on to a locomotive</i>

169
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,341
<i>that's going 17,000 miles per hour.</i>

170
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,679
<i>Of course,
we're dealing with a solar panel,</i>

171
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,348
<i>so there's the extra risk
of electrocution.</i>

172
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,226
Oh, Hutch is a show-off.
No one's gonna be electrocuted.

173
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,019
It's the last thing
you need to worry about.

174
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,271
<i>...or tiny shards of metal</i>

175
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,067
<i>can puncture a suit
and create a catastrophic leak.</i>

176
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,278
- Turn it off.
<i>- Then there's the risk of exhaustion,</i>

177
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,321
<i>loss of consciousness...</i>

178
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,079
Okay...

179
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,956
Look,

180
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,583
Lex, every single person on this mission,

181
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,836
they're the best in the world
at what they do.

182
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,839
Misha and your mom
are gonna be completely prepared

183
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,633
and in total sync
before they go out there, I promise.

184
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,058
Okay, so the jam is somewhere along
section 42 of the Zvezda panel.

185
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,311
I mean, it's pretty far out there,
but we have to remove it promptly.

186
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,522
Otherwise,
we risk losing the entire array.

187
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,567
What we're looking at is,
Misha, you'll leave the airlock first...

188
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,902
No. She goes first. Then me.

189
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,197
She goes left.
Watch the tethers don't get snagged.

190
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,867
Watch your suit here.

191
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,411
This panel comes from factory sharp.

192
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:29,540
Look, I did nine EVAs.
Trust me. I know what I'm doing.

193
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,793
We shouldn't have any confusion
about who is in charge out there, okay?

194
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,254
We have confusion in here.
Why wouldn't we have it out there?

195
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,132
Because you wouldn't be here
if not for Lu and me. None of us would.

196
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,093
You really need to start treating her
like the commander of this ship.

197
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,971
She proved in the first days of mission

198
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,931
she's not fit commander, so relax,

199
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,975
and don't tell me who to treat like what.

200
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,060
You have no idea
what I had to sacrifice to get here.

201
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,242
Now can I see?

202
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,039
Yes, come here, my little star.

203
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:15,461
Now you can see. It's ready. Look.

204
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,465
Now she will get up for this.

205
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,551
She's waking up. Shh.

206
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,391
And she's awake.

207
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,519
Who is she, Papa?

208
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,730
The most beautiful girl in the world.

209
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,234
- Me?
- Of course you! Come on, help me.

210
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,196
Here, we'll put her here.

211
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,572
She's going back to sleep, okay?

212
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,783
- Mm-hmm.
- C'mon. There.

213
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,867
One more.

214
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,537
Okay, good girl.

215
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,871
How beautiful.

216
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,212
Let's continue.

217
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,385
<i>Prepare the crew quarters.</i>

218
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,596
<i>We'll be shutting down
centrifugal rotation at 1530 hours.</i>

219
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,681
Copy that.

220
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,601
<i>- Is Wang Lu there?</i>
- She certainly is.

221
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,021
<i>I have some CNSA protocols
I need to speak with her about.</i>

222
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,983
- Directly.
<i>- You're joking?</i>

223
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,109
That's an order.

224
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,488
Apparently<i>,</i>
China need to speak with you directly.

225
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,992
You might wanna give them a heads-up
that we're all perfectly capable here.

226
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,167
Wang Lu here. Over.

227
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,379
<i>How are the astronauts doing?</i>

228
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,466
We'll be okay.

229
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,222
<i>I just needed you to know:</i>

230
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,641
<i>the thoughts of the Chinese people
are with you.</i>

231
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,233
Thank you.

232
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,819
Be safe.

233
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,009
My Natalya. Hi!

234
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,177
<i>I'll get the boys.</i>

235
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,386
No.Wait, wait.

236
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,890
I want to talk to you.

237
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,727
You look nice.

238
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,979
<i>I had Botox done.</i>

239
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:44,652
Why? Why would you do that?
You have such a beautiful face.

240
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,986
<i>What do you want, Dad?</i>

241
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,743
Um... We're doing a spacewalk.

242
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,287
<i>I see.</i>

243
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,915
<i>I forgive you.</i>

244
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,583
<i>That's why you called, isn't it?</i>

245
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:03,587
<i>You always call before a spacewalk.
This time I know to cut to the chase.</i>

246
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,968
Don't say it if it isn't real.

247
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,011
<i>You superstitious bastard.</i>

248
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,014
<i>You think my forgiveness
will help you out there?</i>

249
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,183
No. It helps me in here!

250
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,227
<i>Then I forgive you.</i>

251
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,144
<i>Happy?</i>

252
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,771
<i>All is forgiven.</i>

253
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,941
<i>- I'll let the kids know you called.</i>
- Nata...

254
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,401
Don't hang up...

255
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,610
Natasha, hello?

256
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,367
<i>And don't forget to check</i>
<i>your coolant lines.</i>

257
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,618
I will.

258
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,620
Where's Lex?

259
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,373
<i>She's at Annie's. She just texted me
to say she's staying for dinner.</i>

260
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,501
Okay, I'll call her.
I'm glad she's with friends.

261
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,044
<i>This is a lot, you know?</i>

262
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,295
I know.

263
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,673
Decompression in five minutes.

264
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,757
Yes, copy.

265
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,884
<i>Listen to me.</i>

266
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,678
It's just you and Misha out there.

267
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,223
Plans don't matter.

268
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,101
<i>Mission Control doesn't matter.</i>

269
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,854
<i>You gotta work together.</i>

270
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,272
You know what's right.

271
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,608
And you keep looking ahead,
find that next hold.

272
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,155
<i>- With the mitts, you're not gonna be as...</i>
- Okay, Matt, stop.

273
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,782
What, do you just lay there and imagine me

274
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,367
<i>hurtling off into the unknown?</i>

275
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,665
I love y...

276
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,834
Tell me you love me
when you get back inside.

277
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,336
<i>Okay.</i>

278
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,127
Mom?

279
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,337
<i>Hey, kid. How are you?</i>

280
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,798
Good.

281
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,258
Good.

282
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,260
You're at Annie's?

283
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,053
Mm-hmm.

284
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:02,307
<i>Oh, good. I'm glad that you're there.
I... I'm not gonna keep you long.</i>

285
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,477
Everything's gonna be okay, right?

286
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,106
<i>The spacewalk?
Nothing bad's gonna happen to you?</i>

287
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,567
I got this.

288
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,485
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

289
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,905
It's time for decompression,
Commander.

290
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,823
Copy.

291
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,494
<i>I gotta go, sweetie.</i>

292
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,166
Okay.

293
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:29,960
You're my reason.

294
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,629
<i>My reason to hold on tight.</i>

295
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,467
I love you, Lex.

296
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,886
I love you too, Mom.

297
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,888
<i>I'll talk to you soon.</i>

298
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,007
Would it be all right
if I were to pray for you?

299
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,759
Absolutely.

300
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,219
Anything that might help.

301
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:25,098
May it be your will, God,
our God and the God of our fathers,

302
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,726
that you lead us toward peace,

303
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,937
guide our footsteps towards peace,

304
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,065
and make us reach
our desired destination for life.

305
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,735
May you send blessings in our handiwork

306
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,737
and grant us grace, kindness, and mercy

307
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,864
in your eyes
and in the eyes of all who see us.

308
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,534
May you hear the sound
of our humble request

309
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,496
and bring these travelers
safely back to us.

310
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,250
Blessed are you, Lord,
who hears our prayer.

311
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,169
I have complete faith in you.

312
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,758
Don't let her kill us.

313
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,764
<i>Sixty minutes</i>
<i>until full decompression.</i>

314
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,817
- Hey.
- Hey.

315
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,028
Thanks for coming by.

316
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,239
Of course. I wanted to catch you
before they got out there.

317
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,743
So, um...

318
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,705
I found out today,
it looks like I might be here awhile.

319
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,335
I'm so sorry, Matt.

320
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,504
And I wanted to see how you felt
about keeping Lex for the duration.

321
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,340
That's what I signed up for.

322
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,508
I doubt when you agreed
to be Emma's emissary,

323
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,635
you thought you'd get
another full-time teenager.

324
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,096
Yeah, well...

325
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,308
if there's anything life has taught me,

326
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,102
you don't get
exactly what you sign up for.

327
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,228
Mmm.

328
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,730
Thanks.

329
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:38,648
And I'm sorry.

330
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,692
What for?

331
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:45,405
That we lost touch as the kids got older.
I always felt bad about that.

332
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,212
Switch to a private channel.

333
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,889
It's just the two of us out there, Misha.

334
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,308
We have to work together.

335
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,811
You have to trust me.

336
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,190
Look...

337
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,443
Spacewalk is like war.

338
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:28,657
You have to trust the man walking with you
to save your life, or vice versa.

339
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,741
Now...

340
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,493
you and I...

341
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,705
First time with emergency, you froze.

342
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:40,252
Trust, it's good. It's important.

343
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,712
But it must be earned, Commander.

344
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,844
<i>You're a go.</i>
<i>Open the hatch when you're ready.</i>

345
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,693
Care to translate?

346
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,781
I took Russian,
but I couldn't get past level two.

347
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,742
Russian's freaking hard.

348
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,703
Hmm.

349
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,081
Tether.

350
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,346
Okay, that's great.
About 20 more feet to Zvezda.

351
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,739
Tell them to stop immediately.

352
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,115
Commander, hold.

353
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,199
Copy.

354
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,334
- What is it?
- The insulation at B4 is damaged.

355
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,878
Something must have happened
during the warm-up phase.

356
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,380
It will burn right through a suit.

357
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:18,178
Our engineers are seeing damage
to the insulation at B4 and B5.

358
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,888
<i>Yes, we can see it up here too.</i>

359
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,389
Commander, I need you to hold tight.

360
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,059
<i>There's an electrical situation
there at the base of the array.</i>

361
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,144
<i>- Do you copy?</i>
- Copy.

362
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,396
What's the plan?

363
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,273
They wanna know what the plan is.

364
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,443
Have them hold there.

365
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,778
Hold?

366
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,035
<i>Just hold fast.</i>
<i>Ground is working on it.</i>

367
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:42,952
Copy.

368
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:45,914
Bullshit!

369
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,098
Hey, I thought you were gonna miss it.

370
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,518
Dad, I'm scared.

371
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,813
Please don't say that you're not.

372
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:10,897
Please don't tell me

373
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,608
that you're not gonna let
anything bad happen to her.

374
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,568
Just be real with me.

375
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,239
I'm scared too.

376
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,334
So, Commander,

377
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,670
what do you suggest?

378
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,838
Like you say...

379
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,257
just the two of us.

380
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,591
What do we do? Wait?

381
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,011
This is your area of expertise.

382
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,683
If you have a plan, I'll follow it.

383
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,601
Good. Okay.

384
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:54,107
We improvise.
Try to get past this electrical mess.

385
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,650
Okay. How?

386
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,570
Make one long tether,

387
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,030
and you throw me out there.

388
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,036
Okay?

389
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,457
- Emma?
- No.

390
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,668
You throw me.

391
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,730
What are they doing?

392
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,614
<i>Group Captain Arya,</i>
<i>can you let us know what they're doing?</i>

393
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,032
We don't actually know.

394
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,743
Emma, can you fill us in
with what's going on out there?

395
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:47,702
Stand by.

396
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,502
That's good, Emma.
Let Misha get you out there.

397
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,007
Ready?

398
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,383
Yeah.

399
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,468
On three.

400
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,513
One.

401
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,597
Two.

402
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,098
Three.

403
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,999
I'm here. Tether is secure.

404
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,292
She did it.

405
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,511
Can you get to the problem?

406
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,311
<i>I think I've found the issue.</i>

407
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,322
The cable has jumped its guide.

408
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,454
I can't get enough leverage from here.

409
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,625
I'm gonna have to get to it
from the other side.

410
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,587
How do I do that?

411
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,088
Copy that. Let me talk to Ground.

412
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,762
<i>What's our next move?</i>

413
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,016
- We don't have a next move.
- We have to bring them back in.

414
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,560
It's reckless at this point,
and they've got to be exhausted.

415
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,520
It's more reckless
to send them back in.

416
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,230
I have Matt Logan on the line.

417
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,607
- Hey, Matt.
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

418
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,276
There are cable guides every two feet
on the back of Zvezda.

419
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,486
- She can tether to them.
<i>- We're way off script here.</i>

420
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,614
I understand that,
but we can't lose any more panels.

421
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,033
You need to tell Emma this.
You need to tell her right now.

422
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,953
Okay, Commander, there's cable guides

423
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:57,040
<i>every two feet under the array
to clip onto. Do you copy?</i>

424
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:57,957
Copy.

425
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,519
Misha, switch to a private channel.

426
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,854
Sure.

427
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:28,071
I can't get to the other side
unless I unclip myself.

428
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,616
You want to untether?

429
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,743
I can do it.

430
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,453
You're crazy.

431
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,747
No. No, it's too big of a risk.

432
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,417
Without proper equipment,
all you have to survive is tether.

433
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,295
If I push myself off the array,

434
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,131
I can grab the edge
and pull around to the other side.

435
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,260
It's this, or we go back in
and risk losing the array.

436
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,638
You have to trust me.

437
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,933
Then do it, Commander.

438
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,828
What the hell is she doing?

439
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,925
No. No. No. No.

440
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,872
Group Captain Arya,
we've lost visual on Commander Green.

441
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,291
I repeat.
We've lost visual on Commander Green.

442
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,170
Misha? Misha, can you see her?

443
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:08,713
Emma?

444
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,465
Emma?

445
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,675
Commander?

446
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,594
I'm here.

447
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,974
My tether is secured to the cable guide
on the back of Zvezda.

448
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,701
Approaching the hinge now.

449
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,969
I've reached the problem.

450
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,020
Emma!

451
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,438
Emma!

452
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,385
Emma?

453
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,262
Commander Green!

454
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,391
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

455
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,351
Good. Good.

456
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,896
Okay. You have to pull yourself in.

457
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,190
Copy.

458
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,408
Okay. Okay. Careful.

459
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:43,910
Good.

460
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:45,953
Good.

461
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,307
Okay, Commander, now grab my hand.

462
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,488
Yes!

463
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,870
No, no, no! Untether yourself.
Untether from your suit.

464
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,882
It's okay. I've got you.

465
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,204
<i>Tether is secure.</i>

466
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,524
Deploy the array, Ram.

467
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,215
It's okay.

468
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,800
<i>It's going to be okay, Wang Lu.</i>

469
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,263
Bring them in.

470
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,600
Return to airlock.

471
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,853
<i>Return to airlock immediately.</i>

472
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,882
What did you say?

473
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,802
In Russian, before we went out.

474
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:55,601
I asked spirit of my wife
to watch out for us when we're out there.

475
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,728
I'm sorry. I...

476
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,607
I didn't realize.
I assumed you were divorced.

477
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,691
No, um...

478
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,778
It was a long time ago.

479
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,781
Still, thank her for me.

480
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,420
Dad, I have to tell you something.

481
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,713
I didn't go to Annie's.

482
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,550
Where'd you go?

483
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,219
Home.

484
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,559
But it didn't feel like home
without you guys in it.

485
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,735
We're gonna go home again.

486
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,488
I promise.

487
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,036
We'll go home.

488
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,833
<i>You may have to let them go,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

489
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,627
Your family.

490
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,301
Really difficult to have both.

491
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,346
Believe me, I...

492
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,434
I tried.

493
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,567
My condolences.

494
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,654
She was too young.

495
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:33,866
Papa!

496
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,457
My little star.

497
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,388
I can't believe it.

498
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,683
It doesn't make sense.

499
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,230
I couldn't get home
to say goodbye to Mama.

500
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,690
I couldn't.

501
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,277
I couldn't be with you.

502
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,280
If not for your mother...

503
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,327
I'm sorry. Will you ever forgive me?

504
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:22,748
Promise you won't ever leave me again.

505
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,795
I promise.

506
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,801
I promise.

507
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,592
Em.

508
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,302
<i>Hi.</i>

509
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,930
Lex, it's your mom. Wake up.

510
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:24,935
Hi, Mom.

511
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,520
<i>That was amazing.</i>

512
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,688
<i>It was.</i>

513
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,940
I couldn't have done it without you guys.

514
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:36,530
That was you, wasn't it?
Who told them about the cable guides.

515
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,074
I wouldn't have said it
if I knew you couldn't get there.

516
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,288
Um, I'm just on the phone.

517
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,874
Sorry, Emma.
The crew wants to toast you.

518
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,627
Okay, I'll be right there.

519
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,962
<i>Go. You deserve to be toasted.</i>

520
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,757
By the way...

521
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,384
I love you, shithead.

522
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,678
I love you too.

523
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,555
You guys are so weird.

524
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,319
<i>Misha?</i>

525
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:20,157
I'm glad we have you thinking for us.

526
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,912
Translation, please.

527
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,246
Learn the language, please.

528
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,582
He said you did very well.

529
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,086
Well, to Mars.

530
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,129
To Mars.

531
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,256
And to Ram...

532
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,300
for guiding us out there.

533
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,011
And handling Ground.

534
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:44,723
Do you think you're the only one haunted
by the sacrifices you made to get here?

535
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:45,891
Hmm?

536
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,769
And you, I vouched for you with Darlene,

537
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,314
but what you did out there was
irresponsible and quite frankly insane.

538
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,650
Keep behaving like that,
you're gonna get yourself killed.

539
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:55,818
Ram.

540
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,611
We all need you alive.

541
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,905
I need you alive.

541
00:45:00,305 --> 00:46:00,461

1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,522
Previously on " Siren"...

2
00:00:01,867 --> 00:00:03,313
This will end very badly.

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:04,901
You need to find her sister.

4
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:06,436
Close the glass!

5
00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:11,886
Come on, let's get out of here, okay?

6
00:00:13,186 --> 00:00:15,847
This part tells us where you are.

7
00:00:16,322 --> 00:00:17,288
I come back.

8
00:00:17,323 --> 00:00:18,455
Donna?

9
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:19,590
Hey, are you all right?

10
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,603
I think you might be in shock.

11
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,278
Hey, it's me.

12
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,389
Chris, you're alive?!

13
00:00:25,414 --> 00:00:26,414
Chris!

14
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:28,151
He needs help, man.

15
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,386
She found her sister.

16
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,897
- Where do you think she's going?
- Home.

17
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:36,174
We lost her.

18
00:00:36,207 --> 00:00:37,912
That's the place where they held Chris.

19
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,599
They're wiping out all of the evidence.

20
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:41,176
They'll be coming for him.

21
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:56,741
They taste better cold.

22
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:58,432
On the house.

23
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:01,473
Thanks.

24
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,459
You're a hard man to track down.

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,498
Glad to see you looking so healthy.

26
00:01:31,314 --> 00:01:32,410
You remember me?

27
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:37,206
I saw you at that... place.

28
00:01:39,137 --> 00:01:40,864
What do you want?

29
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,008
We found that nurse's
car out by Libbey Beach.

30
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,638
When we didn't find you, we were concerned,

31
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:50,714
because the woman you left
with, that nurse, she's...

32
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:51,882
A nut job?

33
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:53,850
Unstable.

34
00:01:57,774 --> 00:01:59,509
She's killed several people.

35
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:02,422
Yeah?

36
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:04,439
She is extremely violent.

37
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,108
Now, do you know where she is?

38
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:10,307
No.

39
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:13,291
She bolted as soon as we
got to the beach, okay?

40
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:16,016
I haven't seen her since.

41
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:18,753
Glad to hear it.

42
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:20,294
Yeah.

43
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,774
But if you don't mind,

44
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,980
I want you to tell me

45
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,127
everything you know about her.

46
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,779
Hey.

47
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,984
You want to tell me where you've been?

48
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,424
Hey. I took the boat
out early this morning.

49
00:02:54,678 --> 00:02:56,473
Really? 'Cause I was here super early,

50
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:58,274
and there was no boat and no you.

51
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:59,642
Okay. Last night.

52
00:03:01,051 --> 00:03:02,717
Female Dragon Fish.

53
00:03:03,548 --> 00:03:05,214
Deep sea species, right?

54
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:06,682
Lives 2,000 feet down,

55
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:09,552
so how'd it wind up
floating dead at the surface?

56
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:12,221
It must have died near the top.

57
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,522
Where'd you find it?

58
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:15,458
Out past the Northern Break.

59
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:16,603
Let me guess. At the coordinates

60
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:18,394
where Ryn's tracker dropped out?

61
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:19,528
Yeah, you know the place.

62
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:21,263
We've been there a thousand times.

63
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:22,531
Yeah, but not alone

64
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:24,533
and not in the middle of the night.

65
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:26,975
It's kind of extreme, dude.

66
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,148
Kind of stupid.

67
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:30,808
I just want to know if
things are okay where she is.

68
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:33,290
It's been a month.

69
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,494
She could be anywhere by now.

70
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:35,628
Plus, I...

71
00:03:39,162 --> 00:03:40,162
What?

72
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:42,109
I miss you.

73
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:45,602
We had this huge thing happen to us,

74
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:47,469
and I feel like we should be closer,

75
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:50,300
but it feels like you're not here.

76
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:53,508
I am, all right? I'm right here.

77
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,697
Are you?

78
00:03:55,722 --> 00:03:57,973
Yes, I am.

79
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,510
I'm here.

80
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,555
Well, darlin', I'll send in these labs,

81
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,312
and we should get a yea or nay

82
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:10,214
on that medical trial
in the next day or so.

83
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:11,775
Fingers crossed?

84
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:18,489
By the by, I, ran into Ben.

85
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,851
Then you've seen him more
than I have in the last month.

86
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:22,682
How did he look?

87
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:25,954
Whole thing seemed a bit
off to tell you the truth.

88
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:27,722
Kelly Osterman's water broke,

89
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:29,276
so I ended up heading out to go see them

90
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,400
on-board their four sleeper.

91
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:31,557
On the way back in,

92
00:04:31,558 --> 00:04:33,358
I passed Ben heading out in his trawler.

93
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:35,902
What was off about that?

94
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:37,457
Well, it was 3 AM.

95
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:41,430
Was he alone?

96
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,288
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was.

97
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:45,857
He wasn't with, you
know, Dale Bishop's girl?

98
00:04:45,947 --> 00:04:47,395
No, Maddie wasn't there.

99
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,849
Thought maybe they were
on the outs actually.

100
00:04:50,397 --> 00:04:51,885
Not that I'm aware of.

101
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,388
What would make you think that?

102
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:55,936
About a month ago, Ben called me twice

103
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:57,357
to check on this damsel in distress

104
00:04:57,392 --> 00:04:58,947
he picked up by the side of the road.

105
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:01,606
The girl was never there when I showed up,

106
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:02,945
either time.

107
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,779
And the second time, Ben
was out cold on the docks.

108
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,908
I don't know. Seems to me

109
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:09,921
the kind of thing people
might break up over.

110
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:14,615
That's just my boy.

111
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:17,632
He's always on a mission to save some...

112
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:19,428
sad thing.

113
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:22,710
Anyways, thank you for that.

114
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:24,331
Please don't tell him that I...

115
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:26,922
Winston, why would I rat you out?

116
00:05:26,957 --> 00:05:29,033
You're how I know what my son's up to.

117
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,427
How about we go out,

118
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:41,308
you know, like regular people,

119
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,349
take you to dinner?

120
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,034
We can get drunk, have clumsy sex.

121
00:05:46,086 --> 00:05:47,504
Like regular people?

122
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:49,638
Yeah, regular clumsy people.

123
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:54,107
Yo, guys!!

124
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:56,673
Okay, whoa. It's cool. Sorry.

125
00:05:56,716 --> 00:05:57,968
Keep goin' with that.

126
00:05:58,762 --> 00:06:01,818
There was a...

127
00:06:01,843 --> 00:06:04,033
nasty accident on the fishing lanes.

128
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,840
It was a local boat.

129
00:06:14,344 --> 00:06:16,544
Guy's lucky the line
didn't slice off his arm.

130
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:17,981
How'd it happen?

131
00:06:17,982 --> 00:06:19,822
Last month, ' we've
been fishin' our asses off,

132
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:22,826
crews are tired, guys are gettin' hurt.

133
00:06:22,827 --> 00:06:24,861
The money's great, but
we can't keep this up.

134
00:06:24,897 --> 00:06:25,963
Somebody's gonna die.

135
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:27,513
You gotta slow down, man.

136
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:30,532
I mean, what about the
fishing and game regulations?

137
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,523
Quotas?

138
00:06:31,548 --> 00:06:32,690
I don't know about that,

139
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,369
but right now, they got
us pullin' everything.

140
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,426
Young, old, sick, weird.

141
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:38,342
No one seems to care.

142
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:40,485
I care. You care.

143
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:42,684
And I know you guys are
just trying to make a living,

144
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,990
but people are getting hurt, Xan.

145
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:46,536
It's not worth it.

146
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:48,927
Let's do something about it.

147
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:53,143
All right. All right, I'm done.

148
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,315
All right, find out what
you can from your dad

149
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:58,430
and the guys on the lanes and
see who's allowing all this.

150
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:00,849
I'll figure out what's
happening on the fishery side,

151
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:02,907
what we're doing with all this junk fish.

152
00:07:03,394 --> 00:07:05,274
Hey, you mind if we take this?

153
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:06,419
Yeah, sure. It's not good eatin',

154
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:08,276
but, um, yeah, have at it.

155
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:09,842
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

156
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,509
Pownall Seafood.

157
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:19,578
They told me you were here.

158
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:20,612
Thanks, Bertie.

159
00:07:20,647 --> 00:07:22,213
Thought I was dreaming.

160
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:23,314
Ha ha.

161
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,958
Been a little while, hasn't it?

162
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:26,518
Yeah, I'm sorry.

163
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:28,842
It's been busy at the Center.

164
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:31,570
I'd like to think you're here
to say hi to your own dad,

165
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:33,658
but I think I know better
than that by now, don't I?

166
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:35,801
What's up, kiddo?

167
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:38,683
Doug told me you were
thinking about bringing me on,

168
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:40,484
environmental consultant?

169
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,848
I didn't know he said anything.

170
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,446
Listen, I know it's not your bag,

171
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,681
but just, before you make a
decision, just hear me out.

172
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,716
Let's do it.

173
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:49,117
Really?

174
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:51,329
You serious? You're not screwin' with me?

175
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:52,660
No, I'm in.

176
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:58,529
You don't know. This is...

177
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:59,910
This is a big deal to me.

178
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:02,656
I want to help you find
a better way to fish.

179
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:05,457
Maybe even make you guys some more money.

180
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:07,388
I think we're fishing just fine,

181
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,461
but if you think you've got a way

182
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:10,050
to make me more money, I'm all ears.

183
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:12,375
All right, why don't you
come by tomorrow morning?

184
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,532
See how we do things,

185
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,849
and then we can talk.

186
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:18,000
And, in the meantime,

187
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:24,159
welcome aboard, son.

188
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,626
Hey.

189
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:41,760
Hey.

190
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:43,122
How'd it go with your dad?

191
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,764
He was real excited
to have me on board.

192
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,265
Ahem...

193
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,224
which kind of sucked, actually.

194
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:51,748
Of course it did. I told you it would.

195
00:08:52,673 --> 00:08:55,168
Yeah, I hate not telling him the truth.

196
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:56,302
What'd you find out here?

197
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,954
Absence of enzymes in the digestive tract.

198
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,540
Irregular ammonia levels.

199
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:02,531
Death by starvation.

200
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:05,090
What's up, party people?

201
00:09:06,258 --> 00:09:07,830
- I got dinner.
- Thanks, Jerry.

202
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:09,564
- Thanks.
- Bone app-o-titty.

203
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:13,284
Sushi? Really, Jer?

204
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:14,643
Dealer's choice.

205
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:16,852
I'm outta here. Tchk!

206
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:20,595
All right.

207
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:26,356
You know this isn't what I was thinking

208
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:29,459
when I said, "Let's have
dinner like regular people"?

209
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:31,144
No?

210
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,662
Not exactly.

211
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,555
All right. How about we skip dinner

212
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:39,670
and just get straight
to the clumsy sex part?

213
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,417
Works for me.

214
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:51,481
Yeah, I remember you.

215
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:00,707
Hey.

216
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:05,181
It's her tracker.

217
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:12,217
She's coming back.

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,437
She's coming back.

219
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:33,414
Ben, over here.

220
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:40,309
Maddie? Look at this.

221
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:45,980
Think it's her sister?

222
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:48,563
Maybe.

223
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:51,800
Says she's off the
beach. She's in the woods.

224
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:52,979
We're just a little bit behind.

225
00:10:53,003 --> 00:10:54,515
You go. I'll collect a sample.

226
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:55,834
Okay.

227
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:07,516
Yes, sir, as far as he's concerned,

228
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:09,127
she's just a deranged nurse.

229
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:11,665
So the fisherman's no longer
a threat to the project?

230
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:13,435
If anything, he helped.

231
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:15,891
He confirmed that she
disappeared at Libbey Beach.

232
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,855
So we mapped a logical
trajectory off the coast.

233
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,564
We were able to isolate sound
patterns 100 miles offshore.

234
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,526
They match recordings from
our specimen in Bremerton.

235
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,635
And you heard it?

236
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,936
She's out there?

237
00:11:27,971 --> 00:11:30,110
Or others very much like her.

238
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:33,942
Better hope you found her.

239
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:08,108
Stop!

240
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:11,739
You follow.

241
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,724
Water.

242
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:16,374
You come back.

243
00:12:16,754 --> 00:12:18,468
You know their words.

244
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:20,606
We need help...

245
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,631
from the people.

246
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:25,091
No!

247
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:26,665
I know people hurt you.

248
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:29,074
But some are good.

249
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:30,818
Will help us.

250
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:46,548
Come.

251
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:03,985
Put it on.

252
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:12,131
No!- .

253
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:16,488
Wa... ter.

254
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,403
I will stay.

255
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:21,179
You go.

256
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,500
We need the people.

257
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,090
Now.

258
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:55,585
Come in.

259
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:58,519
I've got the latest rendering.

260
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,653
The engineer designed it
to your specifications, sir.

261
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:04,522
As requested, the system allows you to

262
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:06,430
introduce a sedative into the water.

263
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,663
One touch will fully immobilize a specimen.

264
00:14:13,273 --> 00:14:14,506
She told me to assure you

265
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,374
there is no chance of repeating Bremerton.

266
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:19,936
Thank you, Nina.

267
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:37,696
Any sign of them?

268
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:39,582
Just this.

269
00:14:41,457 --> 00:14:42,790
Ryn's tracker.

270
00:14:58,203 --> 00:14:59,916
Helen's Antiquities.

271
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,648
Ryn's back.

272
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:04,198
Why on earth would she come back?

273
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:06,456
- We don't know.
- Well, you know if she shows up here,

274
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:09,046
I'll send her right back to the water.

275
00:15:09,263 --> 00:15:10,429
Where are you?

276
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:12,280
We're on our way to the Research Center.

277
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,593
Look, if you see her just...

278
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:14,727
Okay, I'm lockin' up.

279
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:16,023
I'll see you there.

280
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,968
I didn't really think she'd go there.

281
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:22,102
I thought for sure she'd
be at the houseboat.

282
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:23,368
Me, too.

283
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:29,341
It's your mom.

284
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:30,934
Hell, no.

285
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:32,230
I can't.

286
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,290
Worst timing ever.

287
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:34,381
Yeah.

288
00:15:38,987 --> 00:15:40,124
Hello?

289
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:42,533
Hello, dear. Elaine Pownall.

290
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:44,842
Hi.

291
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:46,561
It's your mother.

292
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:47,796
I'm not here.

293
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:49,189
What a surprise.

294
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:52,025
It's, It's nice to hear from you.

295
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:53,500
Thank you, dear.

296
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:56,403
Listen, I was thinking that maybe it's time

297
00:15:56,438 --> 00:15:57,758
you and I got to know each other.

298
00:15:58,238 --> 00:16:00,105
I'd like to take you to lunch.

299
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,254
Wow. Lunch.

300
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,713
Um, that's so nice of you.

301
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:07,295
How's tomorrow? Captain's Reef, 1:30?

302
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:08,296
Does that work for you?

303
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,163
Um, yes. Thanks.

304
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,987
I'll see you then. Goodbye.

305
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:13,146
Okay, bye.

306
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,549
So you're going to lunch with her?

307
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:18,584
I guess I am.

308
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,715
Wow. Okay.

309
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:24,691
Fun... for you.

310
00:16:26,122 --> 00:16:27,955
We've barely ever spoken
a word to each other.

311
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:29,068
She has to stop and think of my name

312
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:30,754
every time she sees me.

313
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,994
My advice, cocktails.

314
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:34,795
Large ones.

315
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:43,240
All right.

316
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:47,141
Trespassing call, north
side near the high school.

317
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:49,177
Couple of randos are
running through backyards.

318
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,345
You don't need to drive
out there, Clarence.

319
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:53,649
We're shorthanded. The sheriff's
out of town. Just log it.

320
00:16:53,673 --> 00:16:55,706
No, lady seemed pretty upset.

321
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:57,808
Said her kid saw a couple
of females running around,

322
00:16:57,844 --> 00:16:59,548
and one of them was Porky Piggin' it.

323
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:01,157
Porky Piggin' it?

324
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:02,390
Yeah, shirt, no pants.

325
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:04,492
That is a lewd and lascivious, Officer.

326
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:07,328
Seriously, nothin' but a Whalers jersey on.

327
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:10,532
That sounds more like a
bachelorette party gone south.

328
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,081
Safe.

329
00:17:26,116 --> 00:17:27,449
We wait.

330
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:39,160
Ryn.

331
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,827
Ryn.

332
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:48,403
This Ben.

333
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:50,369
Maddie.

334
00:17:51,174 --> 00:17:52,340
Good people.

335
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:55,410
This is your sister?

336
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,020
Yes.

337
00:17:57,347 --> 00:17:58,347
Hello.

338
00:17:58,381 --> 00:17:59,481
Donna.

339
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:01,449
Donna?

340
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,051
That's your name?

341
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,492
We need help.

342
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:08,410
Ben? Maddie?

343
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,689
You found her.

344
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:12,999
Hello, Ryn.

345
00:18:13,035 --> 00:18:14,484
- No, no!
- My God.

346
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,070
The other one.

347
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:18,816
Ryn came back with her sister.

348
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:20,235
Yeah, I can see that.

349
00:18:20,236 --> 00:18:21,368
But why?

350
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:22,797
Why did you come back, Ryn?

351
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,339
We need food.

352
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:26,074
It's getting worse, isn't it?

353
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:28,846
Now nothing to hunt.

354
00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:30,544
To eat.

355
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:32,512
Sister, me.

356
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:35,826
All dying.

357
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:41,556
Food!

358
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:43,357
Them...

359
00:18:43,392 --> 00:18:44,358
take!

360
00:18:44,393 --> 00:18:45,425
No, no, no, no.

361
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:46,560
We... We didn't kill it.

362
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:48,662
We were... We were studying it.

363
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:51,929
Friends.

364
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,296
Look, we want to help you.

365
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:55,833
Whoa!

366
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,286
Hey, calm down!

367
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:01,771
Whoa!

368
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:17,441
Hey!

369
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,892
Ryn! Water!

370
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:24,321
Now!

371
00:19:24,422 --> 00:19:25,510
No.

372
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:50,405
My sister not bad.

373
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:52,772
It's her instinct.

374
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:53,808
That's all.

375
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:54,908
She was confused.

376
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,972
Yeah, of course, she was confused.

377
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,367
She sided with you
instead of her own sister.

378
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:03,802
Have you two ever fought like that before?

379
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:04,971
No.

380
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,484
Yeah, she felt betrayed.

381
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:09,698
It's unnatural.

382
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:10,865
They don't belong here.

383
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,249
You're only here because those fishermen

384
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,179
stole your sister from the water.

385
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:18,133
And God knows what the military did to her.

386
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:19,547
Sister was hurt.

387
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,519
A man took her blood,

388
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:24,165
her skin.

389
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,539
I'm sorry.

390
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:28,476
For her, people are bad.

391
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:30,317
No trust.

392
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:31,777
There are a lot of bad people.

393
00:20:32,705 --> 00:20:34,107
They're stealing your food.

394
00:20:34,622 --> 00:20:36,226
Maybe even my own family.

395
00:20:36,227 --> 00:20:37,470
Ben, we don't know if that's true.

396
00:20:37,494 --> 00:20:39,228
We do know that. Xander said it.

397
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:40,565
They're out fishing night and day,

398
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:41,722
catching everything.

399
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:43,457
And the dead marine life?

400
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,874
It's no accident.

401
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:48,597
We are gonna figure it out.

402
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,695
We're gonna stop it.

403
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,897
What about the sister?

404
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:55,101
She's out there roaming the streets.

405
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:57,626
Do you think your sister
went back to the ocean?

406
00:20:58,604 --> 00:20:59,806
No.

407
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:02,059
Will not go without me.

408
00:21:03,776 --> 00:21:06,475
Blood will bring shark.

409
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,746
She need place to...

410
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:10,537
- To heal?
- Yes.

411
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:12,435
But will come for me.

412
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:15,519
I'm thinking it'd be a whole
lot safer at the houseboat.

413
00:21:15,555 --> 00:21:16,587
Yeah, for sure.

414
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:17,922
Somewhere with a door.

415
00:21:22,028 --> 00:21:23,894
Every single time, right?

416
00:21:28,034 --> 00:21:30,869
- Ooh! Hey, Listen...
- Look at that.

417
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:32,770
Go Whalers!

418
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:33,938
Whoa!

419
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:37,762
Yeah, girl.

420
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:11,871
Hey! What are you doin' in here?!

421
00:22:12,137 --> 00:22:13,203
Get away from there!

422
00:22:14,073 --> 00:22:15,765
Stupid meth heads.

423
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:21,320
You can't do that!

424
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:29,583
Holy jeez!

425
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:00,227
Hey, Dad.

426
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:01,194
Thanks.

427
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:02,327
What happened?

428
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:04,162
Hey. Yeah, thank you very much.

429
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:05,608
Okay, listen to this.
Some, half-naked girl

430
00:23:05,632 --> 00:23:07,499
tried to eat the catch
right out of the bins.

431
00:23:08,699 --> 00:23:10,777
Then she beat the hell out of Wally Merton.

432
00:23:10,778 --> 00:23:11,844
- Big Wally?
- Yeah?

433
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:13,166
Why?

434
00:23:13,315 --> 00:23:15,646
I have no idea. I guess
he was trying to stop her.

435
00:23:16,486 --> 00:23:18,087
That's a new one.

436
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:24,358
So, where do you want to start?

437
00:23:24,394 --> 00:23:27,195
I was thinking I'd take
the day to get up to speed.

438
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,374
Check out the different departments,

439
00:23:28,398 --> 00:23:29,936
see how you're doing things these days.

440
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,265
That sounds good.

441
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:33,234
Schoenville Markets.

442
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:35,436
I got a big lunch meeting
with these guys today.

443
00:23:35,472 --> 00:23:37,238
All right, do your thing.

444
00:23:37,273 --> 00:23:38,473
Okay. We'll see you later.

445
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:39,618
Yeah.

446
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:55,356
You tryin' to sneak Cap'n
Crunch into my galley?

447
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:56,974
What are you, like, six?

448
00:23:57,871 --> 00:23:59,452
It's not mine, bitch.

449
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,308
Hey, it's got ten essential
vitamins and minerals in it.

450
00:24:02,332 --> 00:24:04,196
It's my Cap'n Crunch.

451
00:24:05,282 --> 00:24:07,488
You mean you slobs haven't
cleaned out the pantry

452
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:08,788
since I've been gone?

453
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:10,178
- Chris!
- Hey, man.

454
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:11,564
- Dude!
- You good?

455
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:13,189
Man!

456
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:14,927
Hey, buddy. You good?

457
00:24:15,546 --> 00:24:17,256
What the hell are you doing here, man?

458
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:18,441
Well, you know,

459
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:20,509
I missed the stink of
chopped squid and cod's blood.

460
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:23,378
Um, I don't know about this, man.

461
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:24,457
They're gonna find you here, dude.

462
00:24:24,481 --> 00:24:25,861
They already have.

463
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,289
This guy from the facility tracked me down.

464
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,829
Wait, all the way to Alaska?

465
00:24:30,864 --> 00:24:32,391
Yeah, I know. Crazy.

466
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,416
But, apparently, all
he wanted to know about

467
00:24:34,454 --> 00:24:36,939
was the nurse that I
drove to Libbey Beach with.

468
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:41,159
So 3,000 miles to find out about a nurse?

469
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:43,468
Yeah, she's wanted, dude,

470
00:24:43,493 --> 00:24:45,460
for, like, multiple homicides.

471
00:24:45,812 --> 00:24:48,498
I was ridin' with a legit psycho killer.

472
00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:50,035
I'm lucky to be alive.

473
00:24:50,036 --> 00:24:52,867
That and because that mermaid
almost killed you before that.

474
00:24:52,903 --> 00:24:55,620
Dude says it wasn't a mermaid.

475
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:57,488
What exactly did they take from us?

476
00:24:57,523 --> 00:24:58,489
He tell you that?

477
00:24:58,524 --> 00:25:00,057
Said it was a rare fish.

478
00:25:01,494 --> 00:25:02,693
Okay, yeah, whatever.

479
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:04,158
Look, man, yeah, maybe...

480
00:25:04,397 --> 00:25:05,663
maybe it is some big cover-up.

481
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:07,518
Who knows?

482
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,865
But I'm done runnin'.

483
00:25:09,894 --> 00:25:11,518
Look, if they found me up there,

484
00:25:11,528 --> 00:25:12,794
they're gonna find me anywhere.

485
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,819
I'd rather be in danger here with you guys

486
00:25:14,855 --> 00:25:16,567
than all alone

487
00:25:16,568 --> 00:25:18,191
up in Butthole, Alaska.

488
00:25:18,403 --> 00:25:22,132
So this here is top shelf, my friend.

489
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,546
We can crack it open if
you give me my job back.

490
00:25:28,044 --> 00:25:29,445
- All right.
- Yeah?

491
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,148
Yeah. All right. I mean,
I'd rather have that mermaid,

492
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:33,594
but I guess we'll have to
settle for your sorry ass.

493
00:25:33,618 --> 00:25:35,418
- It's not a mermaid.
- Yeah, whatever.

494
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:37,353
- Just shut up and pour.
- All right.

495
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:41,678
Petty Officer Montero?

496
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:43,221
Yes, sir?

497
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:45,037
Just picked up a report from
the local sheriff's office

498
00:25:45,061 --> 00:25:46,494
at Bristol Cove, Washington.

499
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:50,230
Seems a young woman assaulted
a 250-pound dock worker.

500
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:52,500
Sir, what would you like
me to do about it, sir?

501
00:25:52,858 --> 00:25:56,137
I need you to get me a detailed
description of the suspect.

502
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:07,428
Are you gonna be okay by yourself?

503
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,174
Okay.

504
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:10,868
Yes.

505
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,102
Pretty.

506
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:23,914
This?

507
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,078
I bought it for a wedding.

508
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,245
It's not my thing really.

509
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:27,983
I'm having lunch with Ben's mother.

510
00:26:28,383 --> 00:26:29,954
Mother.

511
00:26:31,032 --> 00:26:32,485
What is mother?

512
00:26:32,872 --> 00:26:34,504
Mother.

513
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:37,191
Well...

514
00:26:42,096 --> 00:26:43,429
Family.

515
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:45,064
Mother.

516
00:26:48,281 --> 00:26:49,916
You have mother?

517
00:26:50,424 --> 00:26:53,383
Yes, but she's gone.

518
00:26:54,222 --> 00:26:55,321
Dead?

519
00:26:55,346 --> 00:26:56,415
No, I...

520
00:26:58,315 --> 00:26:59,543
I don't know.

521
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,931
Just gone.

522
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:09,727
Family important.

523
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:12,425
Yes, family is...

524
00:27:13,163 --> 00:27:14,312
love.

525
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,640
You are love.

526
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:22,524
Thank you.

527
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:30,299
To stay safe if you need it.

528
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:37,637
I miss you.

529
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,589
I missed you, too.

530
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:01,076
Bye-bye.

531
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:04,514
Yeah, okay.

532
00:28:05,536 --> 00:28:06,536
Bye.

533
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:21,400
Let me show you the line here.

534
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:24,719
This is from a load of
sockeye we got this morning.

535
00:28:26,724 --> 00:28:28,958
It seems like a lot a
bycatch mixed up in the haul.

536
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:30,929
Yep. It's a new client.

537
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:33,963
Coastal Mills has been
buying, like, anything we got.

538
00:28:33,998 --> 00:28:35,415
Coastal Mills?

539
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:37,239
I've never hard of 'em.

540
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,413
Nobody has until about a month ago.

541
00:28:39,866 --> 00:28:41,675
Trucks just started showing up.

542
00:28:42,142 --> 00:28:43,288
They've been buying the stuff up

543
00:28:43,312 --> 00:28:44,935
faster than we can load it in the bins.

544
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:47,681
Yo, Ben!

545
00:28:48,557 --> 00:28:49,862
Got a second?

546
00:28:50,724 --> 00:28:52,519
- Thanks, man.
- Sure.

547
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:54,354
They found him all the way in Alaska.

548
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:56,289
- In Alaska, man.
- Crazy.

549
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:59,259
And this Decker guy told Chris what?

550
00:28:59,294 --> 00:29:01,161
That the psycho nurse
killed a bunch of people

551
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:02,207
and he needed to find her.

552
00:29:02,231 --> 00:29:03,463
That doesn't make any sense.

553
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:05,599
'Cause if she really was
this homicidal maniac,

554
00:29:05,634 --> 00:29:08,335
then the cops would have
been looking for Chris,

555
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,603
not this Decker dude,

556
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:11,505
some whacko fish doctor.

557
00:29:11,844 --> 00:29:13,736
Right. He's lying.

558
00:29:13,737 --> 00:29:15,057
Something happened in that place.

559
00:29:15,257 --> 00:29:17,157
They wanted to find out what Chris knew.

560
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:19,890
Yeah, only he was too
drugged up to know anything,

561
00:29:19,984 --> 00:29:22,045
so this Decker guy just let him be.

562
00:29:22,464 --> 00:29:23,696
What'd you find out here?

563
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:26,707
You ever heard of a company
called Coastal Mills?

564
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:28,784
No. Why?

565
00:29:28,785 --> 00:29:30,698
They're the ones buying
up all that junk fish

566
00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:31,995
you guys have been hauling in.

567
00:29:31,996 --> 00:29:34,063
I'm gonna try and figure out who they are.

568
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:36,333
So maybe this Decker's connected.

569
00:29:37,113 --> 00:29:38,790
Well, let me know what
you find out. I gotta go.

570
00:29:38,814 --> 00:29:41,382
Told the guys that I would buy
some pizza to sop up the whisky.

571
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:50,925
Thank you for coming.

572
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,240
Well, thank you for inviting me.

573
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,901
Thanks.

574
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:55,692
You have to try Crab Louis salad.

575
00:29:55,717 --> 00:29:56,717
It's delicious.

576
00:29:56,933 --> 00:29:58,562
Thanks.

577
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:01,200
So how's my boy been lately?

578
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,776
I never hear from him anymore.

579
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,037
Um...

580
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:07,431
I know the two of you are busy
with your work at the Center.

581
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:09,341
Yeah, we have been.

582
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:11,410
We have this rescue that's super demanding.

583
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:13,312
It's eating up a lot of Ben's time.

584
00:30:14,072 --> 00:30:15,338
He gets deep in it, you know?

585
00:30:15,373 --> 00:30:16,683
I know.

586
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,355
So how are you, the two of you?

587
00:30:20,337 --> 00:30:21,403
We're fine.

588
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:22,716
Great, actually.

589
00:30:23,173 --> 00:30:24,173
Good to hear.

590
00:30:25,048 --> 00:30:26,214
What did you rescue?

591
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:29,780
A wounded seal pup.

592
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:36,385
I know what's going on.

593
00:30:39,335 --> 00:30:42,443
I love my son, but he has issues.

594
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:45,789
Everybody has issues.

595
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:48,299
Ben's a brilliant thinker,

596
00:30:48,335 --> 00:30:49,879
but he gets lost in his own mind,

597
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,847
and he... He shuts people out,

598
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,049
even his own mother.

599
00:30:55,202 --> 00:30:56,859
He does lose himself in his work.

600
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,854
All his little wounded creatures.

601
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,196
He's devoted to them.

602
00:31:03,718 --> 00:31:05,193
Are you his current rescue?

603
00:31:06,607 --> 00:31:07,712
Excuse me?

604
00:31:07,713 --> 00:31:09,446
Don't take that the wrong way.

605
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:10,908
I was his first.

606
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,427
What are you watching?

607
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:26,048
Um...

608
00:31:26,598 --> 00:31:28,646
something stupid with a monkey.

609
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:31,368
What can I do you for, handsome?

610
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:32,469
Nothing, actually.

611
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:34,576
I, brought you a coffee.

612
00:31:35,085 --> 00:31:37,055
Still like it black with
a little bit of sugar?

613
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,717
Since before you could carry it.

614
00:31:40,387 --> 00:31:43,458
Hey, I was thinking about
taking my dad out for lunch.

615
00:31:43,483 --> 00:31:44,515
Isn't that sweet,

616
00:31:44,551 --> 00:31:46,139
but he's already at lunch,

617
00:31:46,286 --> 00:31:48,744
with the buyer from Schoenville Market?

618
00:31:49,456 --> 00:31:51,589
Mind if I wait here till he gets back?

619
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,491
Like you have to ask.

620
00:31:54,892 --> 00:31:56,403
Pownall Seafood.

621
00:31:57,467 --> 00:31:59,889
No, no. He's not here right now.

622
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:07,175
No. No.

623
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,129
Thank you. Bye.

624
00:32:29,424 --> 00:32:31,457
What is it?

625
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:33,562
Pownall Seafood.

626
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:47,307
Yes, well, Tuesday.

627
00:32:47,954 --> 00:32:49,690
Tuesday would be wonderful.

628
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,440
Yes, yes.

629
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:24,718
He was consumed with finding a cure

630
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:27,885
or some miracle treatment
to get me back on my feet.

631
00:33:28,557 --> 00:33:29,790
He hated seeing you suffer.

632
00:33:29,825 --> 00:33:31,539
That's sort of what drives him.

633
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,335
Yes. Thank you.

634
00:33:33,575 --> 00:33:36,543
He spent an entire year
online after my accident

635
00:33:36,578 --> 00:33:38,612
researching spinal cord regeneration

636
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:41,627
and calling clinics around the world.

637
00:33:42,284 --> 00:33:43,317
He didn't sleep.

638
00:33:44,168 --> 00:33:45,334
Yeah.

639
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,563
Not sleeping is a thing with him sometimes.

640
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,033
He fixates.

641
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,453
While he's rescuing you,
you're... you're everything.

642
00:33:55,089 --> 00:33:57,176
I'm sure he helped you get over your mother

643
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,567
when you were first together.

644
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:02,106
But soon enough, another
wounded creature comes along,

645
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:04,342
and he dives right in after her.

646
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:10,147
Do you need to get that, dear?

647
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:15,981
Sorry. I... I kinda do.

648
00:34:16,302 --> 00:34:18,235
Another drink, Ms. Pownall?

649
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:21,071
Um, actually, Andrea, I'll
have the rosé that I love.

650
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:23,477
Thank you. Maddie?
Would you like something?

651
00:34:25,344 --> 00:34:27,377
Well, if it's Ben, please
tell him I said hello.

652
00:34:28,077 --> 00:34:31,452
Um, I'm so sorry, but I... I have to go.

653
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:33,458
It's...

654
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:36,675
A new rescue?

655
00:34:37,262 --> 00:34:39,311
It's the same rescue, actually,

656
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:41,212
because your son doesn't give up on things.

657
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:43,415
And by the way,

658
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:45,470
I'm not a rescue.

659
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:46,640
Okay.

660
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,019
Well, thank you for coming.

661
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:51,675
Thanks for the salad.

662
00:34:57,717 --> 00:34:59,653
Um, actually, Andrea, could you

663
00:34:59,678 --> 00:35:01,925
make that rosé a martini, please?

664
00:35:06,692 --> 00:35:08,459
So this company, Coastal Mills,

665
00:35:08,494 --> 00:35:09,660
reached out to my dad,

666
00:35:09,695 --> 00:35:10,772
offered to buy up all the bycatch.

667
00:35:10,796 --> 00:35:12,429
Pownall could deliver.

668
00:35:12,465 --> 00:35:14,007
And... and who runs Coastal Mills?

669
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,040
No one knows. They don't exist online.

670
00:35:16,473 --> 00:35:18,473
No one at Pownall's ever heard of them.

671
00:35:19,234 --> 00:35:22,268
There's no record of what happens
to the stuff after they take it.

672
00:35:22,304 --> 00:35:24,604
It's like the trucks
just leave the fisheries

673
00:35:24,658 --> 00:35:25,939
and then disappear.

674
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:30,007
And Xander said the
Department of Fish and Game

675
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:32,032
stopped grounding and fining boats

676
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,541
for overfishing a month ago

677
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,525
right around the same time.

678
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:38,423
So the government's letting it happen.

679
00:35:40,112 --> 00:35:41,751
They're making it happen.

680
00:35:43,945 --> 00:35:45,606
They're staving them out

681
00:35:46,017 --> 00:35:47,887
so they can catch more of them.

682
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:40,858
There you are.

683
00:36:42,212 --> 00:36:43,727
I've been looking all over for you.

684
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:48,579
I thought you might be by the water.

685
00:36:49,602 --> 00:36:51,202
It's okay.

686
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:53,192
I'm a friend.

687
00:36:57,402 --> 00:36:59,102
Thought you might be hungry.

688
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,201
It's okay.

689
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:12,726
We want the same thing.

690
00:37:34,603 --> 00:37:36,448
Want to go back to the water?

691
00:37:38,098 --> 00:37:39,613
But not without your sister?

692
00:37:43,683 --> 00:37:44,849
I can help.

693
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:50,236
You?

694
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:53,533
Yes.

695
00:37:54,696 --> 00:37:56,639
You can trust me, because...

696
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:01,742
I am one of you.

697
00:38:10,654 --> 00:38:13,287
They want to hurt us?

698
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:16,405
They want to catch you.

699
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,202
Danger to go home.

700
00:38:23,683 --> 00:38:24,716
Yes.

701
00:38:28,855 --> 00:38:30,524
Not safe on land.

702
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:33,342
Not safe in water.

703
00:38:35,395 --> 00:38:37,121
Nowhere is safe.

704
00:38:38,284 --> 00:38:39,814
We're gonna change that.

705
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:42,863
We'll make it safe for you

706
00:38:43,713 --> 00:38:45,612
to be wherever you want to be.

707
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,375
How?

708
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:56,098
No, screw that, man, okay?

709
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:59,734
None of this would have
ever happened if that...

710
00:39:00,596 --> 00:39:02,663
that freak fish hadn't
messed me up, you know?

711
00:39:03,572 --> 00:39:05,337
Did you ever ask this Decker jerk

712
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:07,878
what they did with the fish?

713
00:39:08,087 --> 00:39:10,358
They're studying it or something.

714
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:11,576
Who knows?

715
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:15,281
Stop asking me about it, okay?

716
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:18,079
It's good to be home.

717
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:20,292
Good to be home.

718
00:39:32,511 --> 00:39:34,478
Hey, it's Ben. Leave me a message.

719
00:39:35,546 --> 00:39:37,799
Yo, Ben, dude, um...

720
00:39:38,749 --> 00:39:40,298
I'm just checkin' in,

721
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:42,371
and wonderin' what you found out,

722
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:45,820
'cause, 'cause this Decker guy,

723
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:49,329
I'm thinkin' he's the one.

724
00:39:50,595 --> 00:39:52,561
That he's behind it all.

725
00:39:58,636 --> 00:40:01,537
Ben, he ain't gonna
stop until he gets her back.

726
00:40:24,848 --> 00:40:27,286

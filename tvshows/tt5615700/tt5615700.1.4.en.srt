1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,805
Previously on "Siren".

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,776
Non-human blood?

3
00:00:03,801 --> 00:00:05,186
Like an animal or something?

4
00:00:05,187 --> 00:00:08,222
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, just a case I'm working on.

5
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:09,681
I went out to confront her.

6
00:00:10,147 --> 00:00:11,246
Hyah!

7
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:13,248
And she threw a damn metal pole at me.

8
00:00:18,254 --> 00:00:20,756
- Hey!
- I got a text from Chris.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,334
Donna Stevenson lives in Bremerton.-.

10
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:23,850
Says she's a registered nurse.

11
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:27,450
What's happening?

12
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:29,898
Where the hell are we?

13
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:32,067
On some kind of military fort?

14
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:33,969
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,430
That's her.

16
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:02,088
Steady.

17
00:01:47,393 --> 00:01:49,244
Security breach, Zone One.

18
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:51,647
Repeat, Zone One security breach.

19
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:55,250
Follow protocol for
system-wide lockdown.

20
00:02:08,168 --> 00:02:10,122
This is a Stage One lockdown.

21
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:12,259
Security breach in the Med Lab.

22
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:14,865
All personnel observe
lockdown protocol.

23
00:02:15,294 --> 00:02:17,328
Keep the perimeter!

24
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:19,292
Clear! Movin' up!

25
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,300
- Clear!
- Go! Go!

26
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:25,710
This is a Stage One lockdown.

27
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,110
Security breach...

28
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,425
Come on.

29
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,748
Come on. Let's get out of here, okay?

30
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:46,490
Security breach in the Med Lab.

31
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:49,227
- All personnel observe lockdown protocol.
- Go!

32
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:51,696
Watch your corners!

33
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,136
Stage One lockdown.

34
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:01,192
Security breach in the Med Lab.

35
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:03,402
Go, go! Go, go, go!

36
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,639
Security breach in the Med Lab.

37
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:11,132
All personnel observe
lockdown protocol.

38
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,075
Which one is yours?

39
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:15,509
The car?

40
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:16,786
Which car?

41
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:25,385
It's the keys, okay?

42
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,177
Come on.

43
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,684
Go on.

44
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:33,104
Go!

45
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,600
Come on!

46
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,985
Come on. If you're comin', get in!

47
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,278
Come on!

48
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:24,138
I think she's not coming
home tonight, is she?

49
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:27,845
Probably working the night shift.

50
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,053
Chris is gonna be okay, right?

51
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:32,751
We're gonna see him again?

52
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:34,800
Count on it.

53
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:38,030
He's a total badass.

54
00:04:38,924 --> 00:04:40,264
Tough as they come.

55
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:42,139
Yeah.

56
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:44,184
We'll get Donna when she comes home.

57
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:46,629
Make her take us to Chris.

58
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:05,893
Couldn't sleep?

59
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,767
Too much on my mind.

60
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:10,608
Me, too.

61
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:13,020
Got room for one more?

62
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:53,675
Ryn!

63
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:16,344
Xander, give me a call when you get this.

64
00:06:16,345 --> 00:06:17,679
Let me know what's happening.

65
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:19,448
He thinks he found Chris?

66
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:21,856
He tracked down that nurse
whose phone Chris used.

67
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,258
They were following her.

68
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:24,926
- Sister?
- Maybe.

69
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:27,384
Yeah, if we find Chris, there's a chance

70
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:28,719
she'll be in the same place.

71
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:31,121
Ben, look.

72
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:35,464
She's been out of the water
for a couple of days now.

73
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:37,194
Last time, it only took a day

74
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:38,795
till she started drying out.

75
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,135
Seems like she's able
to stay on land longer.

76
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,803
You like it?

77
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:51,353
Moon.

78
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:54,365
It's Xander.

79
00:06:54,395 --> 00:06:55,426
Hey.

80
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,020
Yeah?

81
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:02,396
No way.

82
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:05,038
Where are you?

83
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:08,021
I'll be right there.

84
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:10,829
They followed that nurse
to some military facility,

85
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,079
got chased away.

86
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:14,450
They're staked out in front
of her house in Bremerton.

87
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,383
Hey, wait. I'm going with you.

88
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:17,813
- Maddie.
- Ben, don't even.

89
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:19,186
Me go.

90
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,233
Ryn, I don't think that's a good idea.

91
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,561
This place, it's very far from here.

92
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:24,999
On land. You'd be trapped

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,600
if you needed to go back into the ocean.

94
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:28,184
Look, if we find your sister,

95
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:29,402
we'll bring her to you.

96
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:31,254
We promise.

97
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:36,963
We can't just leave her here.

98
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:41,731
You know, this is the worst coffee in
town.

99
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,700
I know, you say that every morning.

100
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:45,702
I'm a creature of habit.

101
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:46,936
That's one word for it.

102
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:49,349
Morning, Sheriff.

103
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:50,716
Hey, Janine.

104
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:57,045
You recover from last night?

105
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,837
Didn't even have a chance

106
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:00,400
to get a buzz on before you guys showed up,

107
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:01,924
ruined all the fun.

108
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:03,590
Serve and protect.

109
00:08:04,237 --> 00:08:06,838
Jerry's gonna manage that
motel right into the ground.

110
00:08:11,238 --> 00:08:12,701
Delicious as always.

111
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,381
You happen to see this girl?

112
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:19,333
Janine, you have a look.

113
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:23,051
No. No, never seen her.

114
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:25,352
What's the deal with her?

115
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:27,477
Just asking if you seen her.

116
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:30,696
We weren't formally introduced or anything,

117
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,999
but, yeah, I saw her
at the party last night.

118
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,699
She was with Maddie.

119
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,556
I wonder why she can't
just get in the water

120
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:45,715
then get back out like last time?

121
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:46,839
It's not that simple.

122
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:48,064
You saw the video.

123
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:49,956
Her bones crack. It's agonizing.

124
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,775
I just wish we knew how long she can last.

125
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,200
The stories handed down

126
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:55,892
say they can stay longer and longer

127
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,685
each time they come to land.

128
00:08:58,158 --> 00:08:59,354
I will wait

129
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,380
for sister.

130
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,516
I can't say for sure we're gonna find her.

131
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,130
Okay? We don't know.

132
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:09,536
I wait.

133
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,315
Stubborn creatures, aren't they?

134
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,309
Maddie?

135
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:16,908
Let's go.

136
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:20,706
Let's see what we can do about your skin.

137
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,425
Where are we?

138
00:09:36,353 --> 00:09:38,488
This area, I don't know it.

139
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:47,893
So what was that place?

140
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:50,726
Some kind of prison?

141
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:08,362
Hey, are you all right?

142
00:10:09,085 --> 00:10:11,283
We need to get you to a hospital, or...

143
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,634
I think you might be in shock.

144
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,654
My name's Chris, by the way.

145
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:30,877
Donna?

146
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:35,114
You know, I had a nurse
in there named Donna?

147
00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:01,289
We called you as soon as
we secured the site, sir.

148
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:03,555
This is how we found it.

149
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:06,520
Any survivors?

150
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,866
None, sir.

151
00:11:28,674 --> 00:11:30,667
When Ryn goes back in the water,

152
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:32,562
I want to put a tracking unit on her.

153
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:37,567
What?

154
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:39,768
I don't... I don't know.

155
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:41,241
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

156
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:42,872
She's not one of our sea lions.

157
00:11:43,122 --> 00:11:44,283
I know.

158
00:11:44,952 --> 00:11:47,423
What are we saying if
we ask her to do that?

159
00:11:47,588 --> 00:11:50,793
I just... I wanna know
what she's doing out there.

160
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:53,383
Her dive rate, range, velocity.

161
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:55,763
Yeah, I get it. I do.
And I want to know, too,

162
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:57,471
but, babe, she trusts us.

163
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,716
I want her to know we don't think of her

164
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:01,663
as some kind of experiment.

165
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:03,220
She knows that.

166
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,123
This way, we can look out for her,

167
00:12:06,157 --> 00:12:08,125
make sure she's safe if she gets caught.

168
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,704
We owe that to her.

169
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:13,319
I don't want to just let her go.

170
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:21,957
This should help for a little while.

171
00:12:22,435 --> 00:12:25,075
It's castor oil, sea salt,

172
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:27,617
buttermilk, and Boswellia.

173
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:31,047
Old family recipe.

174
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:35,439
I wouldn't eat that if...

175
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:40,952
Can't say I didn't warn you.

176
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,103
They call it an autoimmune response.

177
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,013
That's the word they use

178
00:13:05,206 --> 00:13:08,208
when they don't understand
what something is.

179
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:14,958
You have to sit still for a little while.

180
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,026
Let it soak in.

181
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:38,982
Why did you and your sister
come so close to the surface?

182
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:41,875
You know better.

183
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,197
I'm sure you've been warned.

184
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:47,211
Food.

185
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,080
Hey, wake up.

186
00:14:38,596 --> 00:14:39,863
I wasn't sleeping.

187
00:14:39,888 --> 00:14:41,301
Yeah, we were surveilling.

188
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:50,299
It's 10 AM.

189
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,318
She should have been home by now.

190
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:54,537
Maybe she's working a double.

191
00:14:57,827 --> 00:14:59,378
Well, we can't just sit here.

192
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,306
You got a better idea?

193
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:03,414
Yeah, let's get in there,

194
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:04,851
figure out who the hell she is.

195
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:17,261
They teach you that in college?

196
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:19,016
No, grad school.

197
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:25,436
What are we looking for?

198
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:28,706
Anything to do with Chris,
that facility, this nurse.

199
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:31,709
She's got a serious thing for pigs.

200
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:33,344
Hey, check this out.

201
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:36,781
That's her, right?

202
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,384
Yeah, yeah.

203
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:40,929
Yeah, so she was in the military, so what?

204
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:42,220
Those guys who took Chris,

205
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:43,655
they were some black ops, right?

206
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:44,953
That's what it felt like.

207
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:46,131
I mean, she's gotta be a part of that, too.

208
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:48,345
Some kind of specialized medical unit.

209
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:56,186
Shit. Someone's here we gotta go.

210
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:57,778
Gotta go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

211
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:01,214
Go. Right.

212
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:07,388
Shh!

213
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:27,341
What are they looking for?

214
00:16:31,098 --> 00:16:32,102
I don't know.

215
00:16:32,414 --> 00:16:35,185
Maybe an I.D. or something
tying her to that place.

216
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:44,420
Something's definitely going down.

217
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:46,234
Like what?

218
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:47,389
I don't know.

219
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,296
But if they're here,

220
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:51,335
I don't think Donna's coming home.

221
00:16:56,538 --> 00:16:58,105
We gotta get back to that site.

222
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,241
Man, we were just there last night.

223
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:01,352
They came at us with machine guns.

224
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:02,689
You got a plan to get past that?

225
00:17:04,146 --> 00:17:06,249
I don't want to wind up in
one of those duffel bags.

226
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:46,959
She's out of the tank!

227
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:56,627
Fast-forward. Hurry.

228
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:09,710
Where the hell did she go?

229
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:11,170
Bring up the other cameras.

230
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,039
My God.

231
00:18:21,756 --> 00:18:23,045
Is that her?

232
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,668
Zoom that in.

233
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:28,696
She's walking.

234
00:18:48,248 --> 00:18:50,147
She knew to put clothes on.

235
00:18:54,288 --> 00:18:57,227
All this time, we thought
we were studying her.

236
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,494
Just getting the blood work results in.

237
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,022
She was studying us.

238
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:25,273
You...

239
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:28,078
You have any pills?

240
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,285
You know, for the pain?

241
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,380
You all right?

242
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:40,402
You just need some water.

243
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:44,976
Hey, you have a phone.

244
00:19:45,597 --> 00:19:46,988
Hey, can I use...

245
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:48,935
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

246
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:52,093
Just... the phone, okay? Just...

247
00:19:53,462 --> 00:19:54,558
All right?

248
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:03,442
Damn it.

249
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,223
There's no signal here.

250
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,262
Metalhead?

251
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:44,312
Wait! Wait! Hey! Hey!

252
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:07,024
You need to go back now.

253
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:09,343
You can't wait any longer.

254
00:21:09,705 --> 00:21:10,834
No.

255
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:13,181
Ryn, I am going to take

256
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:15,333
you back to the water

257
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,479
if I have to carry you there myself.

258
00:21:17,636 --> 00:21:18,691
No.

259
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:22,790
In the water,

260
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:25,297
I go eat.

261
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:27,106
Yeah.

262
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:29,346
You... eat

263
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:30,701
in the water.

264
00:21:35,974 --> 00:21:39,939
My sister, she follow me.

265
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,860
Me.

266
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:56,696
It was your idea to come
close to the surface.

267
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:04,521
You blame yourself for her getting caught.

268
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:25,236
Yeah, it wasn't like this yesterday.

269
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,882
Yeah, sounds like they're on the move.

270
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,791
Holy shit.

271
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:31,633
You think that's Chris?

272
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:35,153
That he's dead?

273
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,968
Hang on. We don't know for sure.

274
00:22:39,182 --> 00:22:40,435
I'm not gonna sit around
and wonder. Come on.

275
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,893
Wait! Where are you going?

276
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:42,894
Gonna follow 'em.

277
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,462
Xander, be careful.

278
00:22:53,684 --> 00:22:54,885
Hello?

279
00:22:56,566 --> 00:22:57,975
How bad?

280
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:03,187
Okay. We're coming.

281
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,140
Helen.

282
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,441
Ryn's in bad shape.

283
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:09,445
We'll take her to the Mammal Center.

284
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:10,599
Maybe we can help her there.

285
00:23:12,328 --> 00:23:13,862
There's nothing we can do here.

286
00:23:15,116 --> 00:23:16,183
- Okay.
- Let's go.

287
00:23:34,238 --> 00:23:36,145
I'm gonna see if they have a map.

288
00:23:41,272 --> 00:23:44,190
Wa... ter.

289
00:23:46,822 --> 00:23:48,192
It's right there.

290
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:01,378
Wa... ter.

291
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,523
Um...

292
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:09,053
Okay.

293
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,340
Come here.

294
00:24:12,461 --> 00:24:15,057
Look, water.

295
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:18,086
Have as much as you want.

296
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:20,737
Whoa!

297
00:24:21,104 --> 00:24:22,169
What?!

298
00:24:32,662 --> 00:24:34,176
So now you're leaving?

299
00:24:37,627 --> 00:24:39,127
Come on! It's not safe!

300
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:42,439
Donna, come back!

301
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,306
I had to lower her dosage.

302
00:24:54,483 --> 00:24:55,939
She was nonresponsive.

303
00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:59,123
I doubt the families
of the people she killed

304
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:01,299
would be satisfied with that explanation.

305
00:25:01,718 --> 00:25:03,209
We would have lost her, sir.

306
00:25:04,444 --> 00:25:06,127
So it was personal.

307
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:07,729
You didn't want to let her die.

308
00:25:08,237 --> 00:25:09,440
Personal?

309
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,875
I've been getting reports

310
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,144
that you've been here at all hours.

311
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,547
That you may have lost your
professional detachment.

312
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:19,142
I was keeping a detailed account

313
00:25:19,358 --> 00:25:20,908
of her progress, sir.

314
00:25:22,344 --> 00:25:23,544
Well, the only progress I see

315
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:25,379
is we know they can transform,

316
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:29,628
which poses a whole new security threat.

317
00:25:31,091 --> 00:25:33,076
They could be living among us.

318
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:09,762
Come on.

319
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:12,825
Get in.

320
00:26:16,686 --> 00:26:18,919
Here, drink this.

321
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,921
It could help you stay
hydrated from the inside.

322
00:26:27,261 --> 00:26:28,613
Bad.

323
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,199
I know, but it'll keep
your sodium level up.

324
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:34,113
I added spinach and
avocado for extra potassium.

325
00:26:34,137 --> 00:26:35,137
Come on.

326
00:26:41,075 --> 00:26:43,278
Your body is breaking down.

327
00:26:43,544 --> 00:26:44,923
Remember last time?

328
00:26:45,246 --> 00:26:47,714
Your lungs are gonna shut
down if you don't go back.

329
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:49,149
No.

330
00:26:49,183 --> 00:26:50,203
Maddie?

331
00:26:50,718 --> 00:26:52,052
- Madeline!
- Shit.

332
00:26:52,086 --> 00:26:53,353
Hello?

333
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:56,756
Are you here?

334
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:58,758
- Hi, Dad.
- Mads.

335
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:01,738
Is this a bad time?

336
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:03,127
No, no, perfect.

337
00:27:03,128 --> 00:27:04,162
I was just, um, studying.

338
00:27:04,195 --> 00:27:05,380
What's up?

339
00:27:05,697 --> 00:27:07,931
I just... I haven't seen
you around in a while.

340
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:09,066
I miss you.

341
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,701
Me, too. It's just

342
00:27:10,735 --> 00:27:12,936
between work and classes,
I've been slammed.

343
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:14,538
Just been crashing at Ben's.

344
00:27:15,077 --> 00:27:16,457
Well, that's good.

345
00:27:17,308 --> 00:27:19,390
You haven't seen this
girl around, have you?

346
00:27:20,711 --> 00:27:21,778
No.

347
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:24,948
Why? Is this part of that, murder case?

348
00:27:24,983 --> 00:27:26,249
Trying to figure that out.

349
00:27:26,888 --> 00:27:28,070
Have a good look.

350
00:27:28,722 --> 00:27:30,187
I told you I haven't seen her.

351
00:27:30,221 --> 00:27:31,775
Why do you keep asking?

352
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:35,192
Well, it's just somebody
said they saw you with her

353
00:27:35,226 --> 00:27:36,893
at Jerry's party last night.

354
00:27:37,376 --> 00:27:38,430
Someone?

355
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:40,315
Doug Pownall.

356
00:27:40,956 --> 00:27:42,951
Doug. Figures.

357
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:45,469
Come on. You really
think I wouldn't tell you?

358
00:27:46,137 --> 00:27:48,580
Wonder why he would say that?

359
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,595
Who knows? He's not my biggest fan.

360
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,548
He keeps asking Ben
when he's gonna upgrade.

361
00:27:53,573 --> 00:27:54,806
She's dangerous, Maddie.

362
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:56,404
I'm gonna find her.

363
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:00,091
If you see her anywhere, you let me know?

364
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:02,731
Yeah.

365
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,702
Hey, Sheriff?

366
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:06,819
Dinner tonight?

367
00:28:07,057 --> 00:28:08,084
I'd love that.

368
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:13,409
Okay.

369
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:14,693
I'll walk you out.

370
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,677
Look, I know that you want to keep looking,

371
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:23,476
but what good would you be to your sister

372
00:28:23,477 --> 00:28:24,629
if you die?

373
00:28:33,821 --> 00:28:35,206
He's looking for her.

374
00:28:35,231 --> 00:28:36,398
He has that composite.

375
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,780
He knows she was involved.

376
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:38,936
Okay.

377
00:28:42,163 --> 00:28:43,383
Okay, what?

378
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,022
I go back.

379
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,328
There are three bags.

380
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:01,614
Three bodies.

381
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,395
Yeah.

382
00:29:05,486 --> 00:29:07,113
Hey, maybe...

383
00:29:07,138 --> 00:29:09,139
Maybe Ben found something.
Could you just...

384
00:29:13,861 --> 00:29:15,606
It's... It's her. It's Donna.

385
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,062
Hello?

386
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:20,442
Hey, it's me.

387
00:29:20,751 --> 00:29:22,043
Chris?!

388
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:23,236
Chris, you're alive?!

389
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:26,008
I'm pretty messed up, man.

390
00:29:27,363 --> 00:29:28,844
Wh-where are you?

391
00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:31,433
I'm not far from Libbey Beach.

392
00:29:33,622 --> 00:29:35,443
I can't make it much farther.

393
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:38,025
Okay, just... Just hold on, all right?

394
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,960
W-we'll be right there! We're on our way!

395
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:53,624
Ryn, we want you to have this.

396
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:56,775
A gift.

397
00:29:59,848 --> 00:30:03,631
Now, this part tells us where you are,

398
00:30:04,221 --> 00:30:07,354
so if anything happens to you, we can help.

399
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:12,360
You don't have to wear
it. It's your choice.

400
00:30:29,211 --> 00:30:30,696
I come back.

401
00:30:34,783 --> 00:30:35,847
Sure.

402
00:30:41,156 --> 00:30:42,300
What is it?

403
00:30:45,794 --> 00:30:46,818
Ben?

404
00:30:48,244 --> 00:30:49,596
They found Chris.

405
00:30:49,984 --> 00:30:51,263
Sister.

406
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:52,598
We don't know.

407
00:30:52,632 --> 00:30:53,899
I go with you.

408
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,067
Ryn, you can't.

409
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:58,794
My sister... is alive.

410
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:15,097
Your father...

411
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:18,439
a hunter?

412
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:26,677
He only hunts bad people.

413
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:30,383
I am not...

414
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:32,517
bad.

415
00:31:35,356 --> 00:31:38,858
No. He just doesn't understand

416
00:31:38,892 --> 00:31:40,370
what happened in that car.

417
00:31:40,627 --> 00:31:42,038
He wants answers.

418
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:44,356
You're good.

419
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:53,044
- That's Chris!
- We'll be right back.

420
00:32:25,212 --> 00:32:27,674
Chris! Chris, hang in, man.

421
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:30,090
Hey. Hang in there, man.

422
00:32:30,412 --> 00:32:31,480
All right.

423
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:37,105
Ben.

424
00:32:43,146 --> 00:32:44,224
Go.

425
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:49,010
It's all right. We got you.

426
00:32:49,044 --> 00:32:50,707
Hey, stay with me.

427
00:32:50,979 --> 00:32:52,580
All right.

428
00:32:52,614 --> 00:32:54,014
Ready?

429
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:58,526
Chris! Chris!

430
00:32:58,653 --> 00:32:59,914
He needs help, man.

431
00:33:00,316 --> 00:33:02,532
- We gotta get him to a hospital.
- No hospital!

432
00:33:02,752 --> 00:33:03,981
All right, the clinic.

433
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,616
Doc Abbott can take care of him.

434
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:15,487
Xander, I'll meet you back there, okay?

435
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,056
We got him back.

436
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,743
We got him back.

437
00:33:20,778 --> 00:33:22,113
We got him.

438
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,277
Okay. Go.

439
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:24,722
Ryn!

440
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,037
That girl...?

441
00:35:18,395 --> 00:35:19,746
Her sister.

442
00:35:21,198 --> 00:35:22,564
She found her.

443
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:47,358
Crane arm broke free, sliced him up.

444
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:50,986
Whole town's been looking for him.

445
00:35:51,662 --> 00:35:53,362
What hospital was he in?

446
00:35:53,397 --> 00:35:56,299
Military hospital.

447
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:02,826
And they released him in this condition?

448
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:07,376
He's been through a lot.

449
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:10,375
If there's any way you can treat him here,

450
00:36:10,756 --> 00:36:12,439
we'd really appreciate it.

451
00:36:14,051 --> 00:36:16,771
This have anything to do with that
girl you've been calling me about?

452
00:36:17,022 --> 00:36:18,072
No.

453
00:36:19,398 --> 00:36:20,465
Please...

454
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,787
Dr. Abbott.

455
00:36:27,173 --> 00:36:28,517
All right, everyone clear out of here.

456
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:29,667
Give me some room to work.

457
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,532
Let's go!

458
00:36:44,383 --> 00:36:46,243
Responding to this overwhelming

459
00:36:46,268 --> 00:36:47,602
national and international...

460
00:36:47,627 --> 00:36:49,488
Doc said he's gonna be okay.

461
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:52,477
Thank God.

462
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,360
Where's Maddie?

463
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:56,362
She went back to my place.

464
00:36:56,396 --> 00:36:59,364
So who's that girl that,
Dr. Abbott was asking you about?

465
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:01,039
You know, the one you were calling about?

466
00:37:01,214 --> 00:37:04,182
Just a volunteer at the Mammal Center.

467
00:37:04,534 --> 00:37:06,835
Yeah, she started showing up wasted,

468
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:09,167
so I thought maybe I
could get her some help.

469
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,910
Well, good, 'cause if I thought
you were cheating on Maddie,

470
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,249
I'd have to kick your ass.

471
00:37:14,968 --> 00:37:18,209
Breaking news out of
Kitsap County near Bremerton

472
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:20,239
where fire crews are
struggling to control

473
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:24,053
a massive blaze at the former
Larson Lake Fish Hatchery building.

474
00:37:24,903 --> 00:37:26,071
Dude, that's the place.

475
00:37:26,405 --> 00:37:28,245
That's the place where
they were holding Chris.

476
00:37:28,668 --> 00:37:30,406
They're cleaning up loose ends.

477
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,479
It's just like the dudes
with the duffel bags.

478
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:34,063
They're wiping out all of the evidence.

479
00:37:35,868 --> 00:37:37,201
They'll be coming for him.

480
00:38:08,776 --> 00:38:09,963
Is it working?

481
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:12,132
Yeah. She's moving fast.

482
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:14,686
Already 200 miles northwest.

483
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:16,325
Wow.

484
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:19,047
Where do you think she's going?

485
00:38:21,752 --> 00:38:22,828
Home.

486
00:38:24,372 --> 00:38:26,232
She's picking up speed.

487
00:38:42,196 --> 00:38:43,365
We lost her.

488
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:43,172

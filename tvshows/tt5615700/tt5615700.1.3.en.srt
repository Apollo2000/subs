1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:01,646
Previously on Siren...

2
00:00:04,562 --> 00:00:06,180
God, what happened?

3
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:07,340
Kind of hard to believe someone

4
00:00:07,364 --> 00:00:08,533
when they tell you they just saw a...

5
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:09,834
Mermaid, yeah.

6
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:10,905
There's something else.

7
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,663
The military came and took Chris.

8
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:15,434
Where am I?

9
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,726
Your ancestor lost his mind.

10
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,372
He and his shipmates slaughtered
those beautiful creatures.

11
00:00:20,408 --> 00:00:21,950
What really happened back then?

12
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,549
Why the sudden interest
in the family history?

13
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:26,332
Look.

14
00:00:26,357 --> 00:00:29,306
There's another one? Sisters.

15
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,283
Is that who you're looking for?

16
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:32,399
We're ready for extraction?

17
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:35,082
Whoever did this had to be of

18
00:00:35,107 --> 00:00:36,979
substantial size and strength.

19
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:38,008
Everything okay?

20
00:00:38,043 --> 00:00:39,075
Things are fine.

21
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,560
Just a case I'm working on.

22
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:44,454
In their natural state,
they see you as prey.

23
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:47,757
Their instinct is to kill.

24
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:58,608
Hey.

25
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:01,683
Hey, baby.

26
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,111
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:04,136 --> 00:01:06,079
I couldn't sleep.

28
00:01:26,397 --> 00:01:28,758
They were some
pretty gruesome photos we saw

29
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:29,959
at your dad's.

30
00:01:29,994 --> 00:01:32,235
Maybe we're jumping to conclusions.

31
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:35,478
A bear could have killed that guy.

32
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:37,728
When was the last time a bear

33
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:40,193
climbed into a car
and threw a 200pound man

34
00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:42,018
straight out a windshield?

35
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:44,584
We should get to Miss Hawkins'.

36
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,175
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,623
She almost killed you in the water.

38
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:57,476
My dad found nonhuman blood.

39
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:58,941
If she was in that guy's car,

40
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:01,232
I think we both know who killed him.

41
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,860
This is Kermit the Frog speaking
from The Muppet Theater.

42
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:07,369
Listen, I need
to hire a bunch of spies

43
00:02:07,398 --> 00:02:09,131
for a closing number.

44
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:18,861
Where did you go last night?

45
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,912
Outside in the dark?

46
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:25,201
- Night.
- Yes.

47
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:26,847
Where did you go?

48
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,489
Fully paralyzed rodents,

49
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:41,892
Study Group 1A.

50
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:45,042
They receive 30 ccs in a 12hour cycle

51
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:46,770
from the thalassic specimen only.

52
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,391
In the second group,
we're gonna mix her DNA

53
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:51,804
with human DNA, per my instructions.

54
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:53,326
And then lastly,

55
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:54,512
is our control group.

56
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:56,227
We'll increase the dosage

57
00:02:56,252 --> 00:02:58,029
if the white blood cell count changes.

58
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:01,497
What is it you think we'll see?

59
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,244
Probably a lot of dead rats.

60
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:25,678
Hey!

61
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:27,285
- Xander, what the hell?
- I gotta talk to you.

62
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:28,722
- Get out!
- Seriously, Xan!

63
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:29,758
I'm not kiddin'! It's important!

64
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:30,851
Get out, you perv!

65
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,926
- You get out, Janine!
- Xander, man, what the hell?

66
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,018
I got a text from Chris.

67
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:46,141
What does it mean?

68
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,643
There's one thing S.O.S. usually means.
He's in deep shit.

69
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:50,537
- Whwhose number is that?
- No clue.

70
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,628
There's only one way to find out.

71
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:54,857
No. You gotta go, Janine.
We got stuff to do.

72
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:56,937
- Go screw yourself.
- Yeah, would if I could.

73
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:58,537
Yeah, my jacket?

74
00:03:58,641 --> 00:03:59,774
I'll call you.

75
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,399
Yeah, don't bother.

76
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:02,590
Okay, thanks. Bye.

77
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:05,308
Really, man?

78
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:08,285
We gotta find out
whose phone Chris texted from.

79
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,326
- It's voicemail.
- He just texted.

80
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,983
Maybe he had to turn the phone off

81
00:04:17,061 --> 00:04:18,961
or the battery died.

82
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:21,888
Hi. This is Donna Stevenson.
Please leave a message.

83
00:04:21,993 --> 00:04:23,960
Who the hell's Donna Stevenson?

84
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:25,195
Is she doing okay?

85
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,020
She's restless as hell.

86
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:29,347
She went out last night.

87
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:31,469
God knows where.

88
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:34,931
We need to ask her some questions.

89
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,454
- They found a body.
- Where?

90
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,555
Outside of town in a car.

91
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:42,058
It's Xander.

92
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,790
He got a lead on Chris.

93
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:45,005
They're gonna try to find him.

94
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:46,925
- The missing fisherman.
- Yeah.

95
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,670
The military medevaced
him off the North Star.

96
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:51,362
The military?!
How do they know about this?

97
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:16,874
Yeah, that's great news.

98
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,732
All right, bye.

99
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:21,795
Xander got a text from Chris.

100
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:23,464
He's gonna try
and track the phone number.

101
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:26,194
If he gets a hit, we'll
meet up, follow the trail.

102
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:28,246
- Okay.
- Sister.

103
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:30,817
Now we look.

104
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:33,069
Ryn, Ryn? Stop.

105
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:35,171
Please?

106
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:37,631
We have to ask you
some questions, okay?

107
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,494
When you first came here,
looking for your sister,

108
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,527
did you get in a car with a man?

109
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:45,449
A car.

110
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,255
A man in a car?

111
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,388
We go.

112
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:51,526
Ryn, this is important!

113
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:53,797
- Yaah!
- Ryn, no!

114
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:56,714
MADDIE, are you okay?

115
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:57,894
Are you okay?

116
00:05:58,116 --> 00:05:59,949
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

117
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:02,266
Ryn, you can't hurt people!

118
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,134
Okay? You're stronger than us.

119
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:06,269
You're very strong.

120
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:18,074
You don't know
what you're dealing with.

121
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,991
There she is.

122
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:29,339
Donna Stevenson, lives in Bremerton.

123
00:06:29,363 --> 00:06:30,444
Yeah.

124
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:32,146
Says she's a registered nurse.

125
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,879
I'll get the address.

126
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:37,300
Right. Got it. Let's go.

127
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:41,397
You sure you're okay?

128
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:43,016
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
- All right.

129
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:45,595
This is what I've
been trying to tell you.

130
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:47,477
This will end very badly.

131
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:50,991
You need to find her sister quickly

132
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:53,183
and get them both back into the water

133
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:56,152
before it's too late.

134
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:58,898
Look, Miss Hawkins,
we appreciate your concern,

135
00:06:58,923 --> 00:07:00,499
really we do,

136
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:05,018
but you're applying some
crazy fictional mythology

137
00:07:05,043 --> 00:07:07,010
to a scientific discovery.

138
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,476
I mean, there is another
species on this planet,

139
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:13,850
one that we can communicate with.

140
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,423
That's the problem right there.

141
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
She's a species to you.

142
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:19,776
There's way more
to the world than science.

143
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:21,224
You should know that.

144
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:23,286
You were raised by a Haida man.

145
00:07:23,382 --> 00:07:25,374
Those are made up stories.

146
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:28,558
Don't you ever let your
stepfather hear you say that.

147
00:07:29,335 --> 00:07:32,749
And you, just like your ancestors,

148
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,938
refusing to acknowledge your past,

149
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:38,106
destined to repeat it.

150
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:40,234
I'm gonna open my store.

151
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:43,079
Whatever you do, don't leave her alone

152
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:44,729
and don't make her angry.

153
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:51,411
Morning.

154
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:53,787
Hello, Sheriff.

155
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,785
Just had a few questions
if you don't mind.

156
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,909
Did you find that girl?

157
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,425
The one who threw the pole at me?

158
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,460
Not yet.

159
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:02,754
Opioids. Damn epidemic.

160
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:03,850
Yes, it is.

161
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:04,984
Does this look familiar?

162
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:09,005
It's my daughter's sweatshirt,

163
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,271
the one she stole off the line.

164
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:12,213
That blood?

165
00:08:12,886 --> 00:08:15,475
It's possible this girl's involved
in something more criminal.

166
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,214
Any chance of you coming
down to the station

167
00:08:17,238 --> 00:08:19,272
and helping us piece
together a description?

168
00:08:19,353 --> 00:08:21,499
Well, you know I will.
Just grab my purse.

169
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:22,796
All right.

170
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:26,791
Look, Ryn?

171
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:30,690
Now, you're very smart.

172
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:35,847
Okay, so I'm gonna try
and explain something to you.

173
00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:39,315
Your sister could be anywhere,

174
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:42,325
maybe very far from here.

175
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:45,014
It's gonna be very difficult
to find her,

176
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,640
but we are going to try.

177
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:55,435
Our friend Xander, he's looking.

178
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:58,282
Maybe he'll find something.

179
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:01,721
If he finds our friend, he may
know where your sister is.

180
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,051
Okay.

181
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,219
Yes.

182
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:10,896
Now, in the meantime,

183
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:15,277
we would like to know more about you.

184
00:09:16,284 --> 00:09:17,470
To learn.

185
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:19,539
Like last night,

186
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:21,187
you asked me questions.

187
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:26,780
I learn.

188
00:09:27,188 --> 00:09:28,426
Yes.

189
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,983
So will you

190
00:09:30,044 --> 00:09:31,356
come with us

191
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,739
to our rescue center
so that we can learn?

192
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:36,790
About you.

193
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,533
I will go,

194
00:09:41,676 --> 00:09:44,577
then we find sister.

195
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,810
Hey hon...

196
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:06,083
We have tickets
to the theater on the 16th.

197
00:10:06,118 --> 00:10:08,085
The theater.

198
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,973
Wouldn't miss it.
Hoping for two intermissions.

199
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:12,126
Ha. I'll see if I can arrange it.

200
00:10:12,264 --> 00:10:13,473
Breakfast?

201
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:14,791
No, thanks, Sylvia.

202
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:16,620
I'm gonna grab something on the way in.

203
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,662
Thank you, Syl.

204
00:10:18,697 --> 00:10:20,983
I was thinking about doing
my benefit for the clinic

205
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:23,020
on Tuesday the following week.

206
00:10:23,075 --> 00:10:24,485
- Sounds fine.
- Are you sure?

207
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,376
That's usually your night out.

208
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:27,445
That why you picked it?

209
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,736
No, dear.

210
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:31,041
Yeah, I can make it work.

211
00:10:31,243 --> 00:10:33,704
You must have a very
understanding girlfriend.

212
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:37,280
All the women in my life
are gems, right, Syl?

213
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,749
If you say so.

214
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:41,726
Ben came by to see me.

215
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,220
Did he?

216
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:44,701
About what?

217
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:46,957
Well, he was asking questions
about the Pownall history.

218
00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:48,320
What kind of questions?

219
00:10:48,393 --> 00:10:51,645
He wanted to know about the...
the family lore.

220
00:10:51,872 --> 00:10:53,752
It was strange
the way he asked, though.

221
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:55,436
- What do you mean?
- His tone.

222
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:57,829
It was accusing, like he
thought I was hiding something.

223
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:01,004
Well, what would make him
ask about that now?

224
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,613
You got me. Helen Hawkins maybe.

225
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:06,945
That woman loves to stir the pot.

226
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,036
Yes, she does.

227
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:09,133
You know, he should know better

228
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:10,890
than to listen to anything
she has to say.

229
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,248
I'm worried about him, Ted.

230
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:15,230
He never comes by, he never calls.

231
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:16,487
He's just finding himself.

232
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:18,902
They all go through it.
He'll come back.

233
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:20,991
In the meantime, I hope
you didn't tell him.

234
00:11:21,337 --> 00:11:22,692
Tell him what?

235
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:25,375
Your family was batshit crazy.

236
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:27,675
Of course I did.

237
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,848
Take a look around, honey.
It's no secret.

238
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:50,980
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

239
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:00,859
So your sister,

240
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:03,833
can she change on land the way you do?

241
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,804
Ryn, your sister,

242
00:12:08,065 --> 00:12:11,702
can she change on land the way you do?

243
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,043
Yes.

244
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:15,812
Sister change.

245
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:19,082
But hard.

246
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,380
Pain.

247
00:12:25,213 --> 00:12:28,825
Wait, is that why
you tried to hurt me? Ryn?

248
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:30,727
Ryn?

249
00:12:32,124 --> 00:12:34,825
Is that why you tried to hurt me?

250
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:36,864
In the water?

251
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:38,660
Because you were in pain?

252
00:12:38,777 --> 00:12:40,743
No.

253
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:45,075
In water, we fight.

254
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:51,211
I kill.

255
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:53,903
Or you kill.

256
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:57,904
All right.

257
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:02,423
Thank you.

258
00:13:06,675 --> 00:13:08,148
What do you got?

259
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,987
I wanted you to see this, sir.

260
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:12,844
This is Group 1A.

261
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:14,657
They were the fully paralyzed rats.

262
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,960
They received
pure DNA from the creature.

263
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:22,201
How can this be?

264
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,906
It's extraordinary.

265
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:28,191
My God.

266
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:42,832
All right. Hey, Ryn.

267
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:48,406
Can you tell me how many
of your species there are?

268
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,675
How many like you?

269
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:54,478
Is it just you and your sister?

270
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,686
- Or...
- No.

271
00:13:57,388 --> 00:13:59,254
Many.

272
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:02,080
Many.

273
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,613
And the others.

274
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:09,859
The ones like you, like your sister,

275
00:14:09,895 --> 00:14:12,884
do they want to come here on land?

276
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:15,898
Land bad.

277
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:18,449
I learn this.

278
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:21,790
Hey, hey, it's okay.

279
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:24,708
It's just... It's just a phone.

280
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:28,712
Hey, Xander? What did you find out?

281
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:31,290
Not much, but we know whose
phone Chris called from.

282
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:32,873
It's a nurse, lives in Bremerton.

283
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,804
So you think they got him
at a hospital?

284
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:36,170
No, I doubt it.

285
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:37,362
The sheriff called around

286
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:38,900
when they first took
him, came up empty,

287
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:41,291
but we're headed to her place now.
Can you meet us?

288
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,215
Actually, I... I can't right now.

289
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:47,027
Why not?

290
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:51,868
I'm kinda onto something here, too.

291
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,486
Wait. Give it here.

292
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,735
- Yeah? What?
- Put it down.

293
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:59,646
I'm trying to figure out

294
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:02,838
what it is you guys caught on the boat.

295
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,915
Hoping maybe it'll lead us
to the guys who took it.

296
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:07,626
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

297
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:10,654
Let me know if you guys find Chris.

298
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,224
And, I'll meet you ASAP.

299
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:15,230
All right, cool. Later.

300
00:15:19,262 --> 00:15:21,030
You were right as rain, boss.

301
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:22,459
Yeah? About what?

302
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:25,467
That was the victim's blood
on the clothing you found.

303
00:15:25,737 --> 00:15:28,186
I'm thinking an animal came across it,

304
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:29,526
dragged it from the scene,

305
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,775
and that's why we found
nonhuman blood.

306
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:35,610
Week ago, my biggest problems

307
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,116
were a bar brawl and a meth lab.

308
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:43,297
Now I've got a murder and a
missing fisherman on my hands.

309
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:45,508
You check in on Chris Mueller's
family like I asked?

310
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,407
They still haven't heard from him.

311
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:48,975
His mom's pretty freaked.

312
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,062
Can't say that I blame her.

313
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,313
I'd feel the same if my kid disappeared

314
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:55,171
in the middle of the Bering Strait.

315
00:16:01,232 --> 00:16:02,606
So what do you got?

316
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:05,695
That's her.

317
00:16:06,754 --> 00:16:08,188
Okay.

318
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:14,464
Primate intelligence test.

319
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,846
You're kidding, right?

320
00:16:16,115 --> 00:16:19,322
No. There are 25 images
on this chart I gave her.

321
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:21,464
Now, when I get this screen to work,

322
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:23,793
she'll see the same 25 images,

323
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:25,732
only they'll be scrambled.

324
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,111
All right.

325
00:16:33,112 --> 00:16:35,705
She puts them in the
same order as the chart.

326
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,966
Is the screen working?

327
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:40,756
Yeah.

328
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,103
She did it.

329
00:16:56,728 --> 00:16:58,076
Yes, she did.

330
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:08,562
How long we gonna sit here?

331
00:17:08,606 --> 00:17:09,913
Till she comes out.

332
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:12,444
What makes you so sure she's even here?

333
00:17:12,752 --> 00:17:13,871
That's her car.

334
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:15,820
It's registered at the DMV.
I saw it online.

335
00:17:15,862 --> 00:17:17,484
Okay, so let's just
go knock on the door then.

336
00:17:17,508 --> 00:17:19,944
And say what?
The military took our friend

337
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:21,013
when they captured the mermaid

338
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:22,604
and he texted us from your phone?

339
00:17:22,629 --> 00:17:24,037
Well, we gotta do something.

340
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:25,624
She knows where Chris is.

341
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:27,759
He could be dying right now
as we sit here on our asses.

342
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:29,462
Use your head for, like, a minute.

343
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:31,821
Please. She's not gonna
tell us anything,

344
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,422
and if we scare her, she's not
gonna go anywhere near him,

345
00:17:33,446 --> 00:17:34,714
so just chill.

346
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,751
I don't know.

347
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:38,949
She's gonna lead us to Chris.

348
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:41,522
I know she is.

349
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:45,631
Let's walk over there.

350
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:47,428
Yeah, up on here.

351
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:51,098
Good.

352
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,935
Wow. 196.

353
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:56,971
That can't be right.

354
00:17:57,186 --> 00:17:58,271
Hold on.

355
00:17:58,347 --> 00:17:59,751
One second.

356
00:18:01,851 --> 00:18:03,168
Yeah.

357
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:04,511
196.

358
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:09,409
Wow. We're gonna have to do
a bone density study.

359
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:15,062
You like that?

360
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:17,651
I'll show you how it works.

361
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:21,808
It's okay.

362
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:23,697
All right.

363
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,296
Press there.

364
00:18:56,841 --> 00:18:57,928
All right.

365
00:18:59,335 --> 00:19:00,528
Just relax your foot.

366
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:09,693
Wow.

367
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:13,674
Reflexes working.

368
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:21,605
Who's that?

369
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:22,890
It's Janine.

370
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:24,745
I'll call her back.

371
00:19:29,504 --> 00:19:30,998
You can't be such a dick to her, man.

372
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:32,698
- What?
- I'm just saying...

373
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:36,026
That's just Janine and me.
It's always been that way.

374
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,416
Yeah, well, I don't want my best friend

375
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,361
and my girl to be hating on each other.

376
00:19:39,701 --> 00:19:40,941
Janine's your girl?

377
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:42,727
- We're hangin' out.
- Sorry, man.

378
00:19:42,753 --> 00:19:43,963
Thought you guys were just screwin'.

379
00:19:43,987 --> 00:19:45,920
Yeah, we were, but...

380
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:47,335
now we're not.

381
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:49,541
Okay.

382
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,647
- That's her.
- You sure?

383
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:55,549
Yeah. I saw a picture on Facebook.

384
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,847
Hey, Dad.

385
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:29,612
Hey. Got the invoice reports
from last week?

386
00:21:29,683 --> 00:21:30,792
Right here.

387
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:32,387
Up from the week before.

388
00:21:32,461 --> 00:21:33,711
Griffin's really comin' through for us.

389
00:21:33,735 --> 00:21:36,155
- That's a great deal you set up.
- Thanks.

390
00:21:36,615 --> 00:21:38,008
Hey, I was wondering about

391
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:39,928
that letter you drafted to the board.

392
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:42,742
I meant to talk to you about that.

393
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:43,897
I think it's a great idea

394
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:45,558
bringing Ben in as a consultant.

395
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:48,745
Environmental advisor...
Sends a great message.

396
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,414
That's what I thought, PRwise.

397
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:53,507
I mean, you know, he's never
gonna play the role you play.

398
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:55,921
- Obviously.
- Right.

399
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:59,420
But, it'll make your mother happy.

400
00:22:02,126 --> 00:22:03,751
Makes sense.

401
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:04,851
Invoice reports.

402
00:22:05,348 --> 00:22:06,680
You think he'll do it?

403
00:22:06,748 --> 00:22:08,068
Depends on our approach.

404
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:10,050
We both know your brother.

405
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:17,064
How long can you stay here?

406
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,350
On land?

407
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:20,681
Last time, she only lasted a day.

408
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,003
Ryn?

409
00:22:24,548 --> 00:22:26,609
You might need to get back
in the water soon.

410
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:27,976
No.

411
00:22:28,202 --> 00:22:29,971
Find sister.

412
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:31,538
You might have to.

413
00:22:31,754 --> 00:22:34,855
No! You say help me.

414
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:36,884
You say this.

415
00:22:47,435 --> 00:22:49,369
How long's she been like this?

416
00:22:50,214 --> 00:22:51,814
Several hours.

417
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,222
Minimal movement,

418
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,850
oxygen levels depleted,

419
00:22:55,297 --> 00:22:56,963
pulse slowing.

420
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:02,477
Hang in there.

421
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,190
The worst is over.

422
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:09,322
You find sister.

423
00:23:09,524 --> 00:23:10,790
You say this!

424
00:23:10,815 --> 00:23:11,854
Ryn, we're trying.

425
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:13,669
We've got people looking.

426
00:23:15,034 --> 00:23:17,266
Hey. How's it goin'?

427
00:23:17,358 --> 00:23:18,366
Hey, Jerry.

428
00:23:18,391 --> 00:23:19,391
What are you doing here?

429
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:20,734
Came to feed the lions.

430
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:22,136
That's cool. I can do it.

431
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:23,956
I'm here now. I might as well.

432
00:23:25,848 --> 00:23:27,614
Hey. I'm Jerry.

433
00:23:27,995 --> 00:23:29,136
I am Ryn.

434
00:23:29,735 --> 00:23:31,281
Ryn's a friend of mine from school.

435
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:33,567
Cool. What's with the camera?

436
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:35,014
You guys shootin' a porno?

437
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:37,190
He's onto us.

438
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,428
Don't you need to get
the sea lions fed, Jer?

439
00:23:42,316 --> 00:23:44,950
Right. Sure thing.

440
00:23:50,524 --> 00:23:52,857
We better lock this stuff up.

441
00:23:57,926 --> 00:23:59,826
Got a text from Xander.

442
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:01,467
They're following that nurse.

443
00:24:01,492 --> 00:24:03,343
- Call him.
- Okay.

444
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,672
There you go.

445
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:10,871
Yeah, one more.

446
00:24:12,448 --> 00:24:13,934
Good girl.

447
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:23,563
Hey. You scared me.

448
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,560
It's okay.

449
00:24:29,131 --> 00:24:32,699
So, go to school with MADDIE?

450
00:24:32,911 --> 00:24:34,768
You must be really smart, too.

451
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:37,037
I don't know what
you guys are doin' later,

452
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:38,772
but I'm havin' a party.

453
00:24:38,807 --> 00:24:40,264
At the Siren Song.

454
00:24:40,561 --> 00:24:42,428
What?! What?!

455
00:24:47,755 --> 00:24:49,455
It's a motel on Route 84.

456
00:24:49,518 --> 00:24:50,884
I manage it on weekends.

457
00:24:50,946 --> 00:24:52,812
It's gonna be epic. You wanna go?

458
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,250
- Go?
- Yeah.

459
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,446
You will take me.

460
00:24:58,295 --> 00:24:59,546
Sure, I'll take you.

461
00:24:59,588 --> 00:25:01,921
Yeah. I'd... I'd love to take you.

462
00:25:02,131 --> 00:25:03,730
So call me back.

463
00:25:03,766 --> 00:25:04,943
Let me know what you find out.

464
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:05,967
We'll meet up.

465
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,012
All right, let's tell her.

466
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,169
Yeah.

467
00:25:31,536 --> 00:25:33,770
Hey, you want a beer?

468
00:25:35,058 --> 00:25:36,440
Beer.

469
00:25:51,689 --> 00:25:54,228
So, Ryn, you an exchange student?

470
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:56,115
That can't be easy.

471
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:57,657
You know, I hear that English

472
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:59,563
is one of the toughest
languages to learn.

473
00:25:59,651 --> 00:26:01,996
Yes. I learn.

474
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,509
Well, you are doing great.

475
00:26:11,952 --> 00:26:13,342
Okay, we're looking for her.

476
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:14,789
Let me know if you see her.

477
00:26:14,943 --> 00:26:16,779
She hasn't shown up at Helen's.

478
00:26:16,902 --> 00:26:18,257
Did Jerry text you back?

479
00:26:18,282 --> 00:26:19,880
He was outside.
He might have seen her leave.

480
00:26:19,904 --> 00:26:21,284
No, not yet.

481
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:23,023
Think she went back in the water?

482
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:24,814
Not the way she was talking earlier.

483
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,015
Come on. Let's go.

484
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,903
Let's look in town.

485
00:26:31,942 --> 00:26:33,713
We've been following her for a while.

486
00:26:33,738 --> 00:26:34,813
It's a dead end, man.

487
00:26:34,838 --> 00:26:35,919
She's heading toward 84.

488
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:36,955
That'll take her out of town,

489
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:38,132
and maybe she's going to work.

490
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:39,628
Just run her off the road.
We'll corner her.

491
00:26:39,652 --> 00:26:40,862
Yeah, 'cause attempted murder

492
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:43,113
will definitely make her talk.
Just chill.

493
00:26:54,872 --> 00:26:57,572
Hey. You smoke?

494
00:26:57,675 --> 00:26:59,008
No smoke.

495
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,499
Ryn.

496
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:02,851
Yeah, smoking sucks.

497
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:14,602
Can you get that?

498
00:27:14,645 --> 00:27:15,844
Yeah.

499
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:18,590
It's Jerry. He's having a party.

500
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,930
Big surprise.

501
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,772
- Wait, pull over.
- Why? What?

502
00:27:25,128 --> 00:27:26,928
Look.

503
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,048
Let's go.

504
00:27:57,775 --> 00:27:59,075
Can you see her?

505
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,240
No.

506
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:02,337
Hey, there's Jerry.

507
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:09,118
Hey, Bro.

508
00:28:09,393 --> 00:28:10,675
Hey.

509
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:12,575
Doug, what are...
What are you doing here?

510
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:14,003
Thought you might be here.

511
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,517
Cool.

512
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,769
Hey, MADDIE.

513
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:17,833
Hey, Doug.

514
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:19,085
Do you want to grab a beer?

515
00:28:19,118 --> 00:28:20,992
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

516
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,471
I'd love to. Really, I would.

517
00:28:22,496 --> 00:28:24,777
I just... I'm looking
for someone right now.

518
00:28:24,802 --> 00:28:26,376
Can we do this a little later?

519
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:30,317
Maybe you better talk to him.

520
00:28:30,482 --> 00:28:31,614
I'll find her.

521
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,970
All right. Go.

522
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,820
Her DNA is showing enormous potential.

523
00:28:45,448 --> 00:28:48,124
We are accelerating the testing
based on what we're seeing.

524
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,626
I'm afraid we'll have to reconsider

525
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:51,437
the rate at which
we're moving, Admiral.

526
00:28:51,516 --> 00:28:53,226
And why would we do that?

527
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,440
You can see by our numbers

528
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:56,785
that the extractions are
affecting her adversely.

529
00:28:57,378 --> 00:28:59,953
Well, my concern at the
moment is results, Decker.

530
00:29:00,057 --> 00:29:02,724
Respectfully, we have
to slow the program down, sir.

531
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:04,259
She's in distress.

532
00:29:04,449 --> 00:29:06,904
Well, I'm sorry about that. I am.

533
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:09,261
But we're making progress here.

534
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:10,714
You need to do whatever it takes

535
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:12,271
to keep this program on track

536
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,116
and keep her alive.

537
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:33,442
So what's up?

538
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:35,448
I just wanted to grab a beer,

539
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:36,619
just hang out.

540
00:29:36,716 --> 00:29:39,450
Talk about this plan Dad's got.

541
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,174
What plan?

542
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:43,442
He wanted to see
if you'd do some work with us.

543
00:29:43,802 --> 00:29:45,603
We've been through this
a million times.

544
00:29:45,628 --> 00:29:48,342
No, we haven't been through this.

545
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:50,493
You've been through it with him.

546
00:29:50,668 --> 00:29:52,517
Okay, sure.

547
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,847
Listen, it used to be
you and me, right?

548
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:58,394
On the same team.

549
00:29:58,488 --> 00:30:00,263
- We are.
- No, no.

550
00:30:00,288 --> 00:30:03,483
Now you act like it's you over here,

551
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:07,396
and I'm with Mom and Dad
somewhere else.

552
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,121
I don't get it.

553
00:30:09,187 --> 00:30:10,547
What did I do to make that happen?

554
00:30:10,587 --> 00:30:12,082
Nothing, Doug.

555
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,976
YYYou didn't do anything.

556
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,599
There she is.

557
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:17,953
I got it.

558
00:30:17,978 --> 00:30:19,876
- Who?
- Just one of...

559
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,262
one of Maddie's friends.

560
00:30:55,994 --> 00:30:57,994
Night swim!

561
00:31:12,076 --> 00:31:14,710
Ryn. Ryn!

562
00:31:14,846 --> 00:31:17,146
Ryn! Ryn, get out!

563
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:19,642
God.

564
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:26,248
All right, shut it down!

565
00:31:26,434 --> 00:31:27,924
Everybody, out of the pool.

566
00:31:28,026 --> 00:31:29,483
Let's move, people!

567
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:31,406
Noise complaint!

568
00:31:31,615 --> 00:31:32,958
Party's over, guys.

569
00:31:33,137 --> 00:31:35,070
We were just heading out.

570
00:31:35,406 --> 00:31:36,591
Hey, is MADDIE here?

571
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:38,920
She must have just left.

572
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,908
You seen this girl?

573
00:31:46,957 --> 00:31:49,420
No. Who is she?

574
00:31:49,566 --> 00:31:51,375
It's a person of interest.

575
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,922
Young people's party.

576
00:31:53,015 --> 00:31:54,501
Thought she might be around.

577
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:58,842
- You guys get home safe, all right?
- Sure thing.

578
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,289
Let's talk later.

579
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:08,471
Ryn. Ryn, Ryn!

580
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:10,545
Come in. In. In.

581
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:22,518
The police are out there.

582
00:32:23,246 --> 00:32:24,724
Danger.

583
00:32:39,304 --> 00:32:40,510
Where the hell are we?

584
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:41,984
Some kind of military fort?

585
00:32:42,053 --> 00:32:43,977
There's no way
we're getting in there, man.

586
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,618
Chris is in there.

587
00:32:48,712 --> 00:32:51,031
I'm not gonna just drive away.
We gotta try.

588
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah, they don't look like they're

589
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:57,034
coming to give us directions.

590
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,281
No, they do not.

591
00:32:58,396 --> 00:32:59,495
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

592
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,437
I'm going!

593
00:33:13,718 --> 00:33:15,908
Ryn, you're not safe out there.

594
00:33:15,978 --> 00:33:17,741
You must stay here.

595
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,772
Why didn't you change
when you went in the water?

596
00:33:30,787 --> 00:33:33,197
Not my water.

597
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,951
Not your water?

598
00:33:36,827 --> 00:33:39,179
You mean you need ocean water.

599
00:33:40,565 --> 00:33:43,236
No, no, no, no, you have to stay here

600
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,939
until the police are gone.

601
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:46,276
Police.

602
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:48,618
People who might be looking for you.

603
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,919
Trust me. You're safer here.

604
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:53,781
Trust?

605
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:57,747
I say something, and it's true.

606
00:33:58,442 --> 00:33:59,742
I promise.

607
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:03,197
No. You not look for sister.

608
00:34:03,233 --> 00:34:04,677
We are, Ryn.

609
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:07,158
We have people helping us.

610
00:34:07,725 --> 00:34:10,793
If you believe me, this is trust.

611
00:34:12,956 --> 00:34:14,573
It's an idea, um...

612
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:16,745
Something we believe?

613
00:34:17,007 --> 00:34:18,282
Freedom.

614
00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:21,419
Love.

615
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:24,901
What... What you feel for your sister.

616
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:27,219
Trust.

617
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:31,016
This is hard.

618
00:34:32,249 --> 00:34:33,655
Yes.

619
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:36,971
Very hard.

620
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:42,836
Some people I trust.

621
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:47,146
Some people hurt me.

622
00:34:47,777 --> 00:34:49,320
That's right.

623
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:54,869
Like man

624
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:57,612
in car.

625
00:34:59,403 --> 00:35:00,725
Yes.

626
00:35:10,782 --> 00:35:11,948
He hurt you?

627
00:35:13,334 --> 00:35:15,084
The man in the car?

628
00:35:15,858 --> 00:35:17,421
He try.

629
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,581
Um, let's dry you off.

630
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,768
You don't have to run away from us.

631
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:54,749
You are afraid...

632
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,620
of me.

633
00:36:11,422 --> 00:36:13,447
- You in there?
- Yeah, we're here.

634
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:23,578
Everything okay?

635
00:36:26,024 --> 00:36:27,252
Yeah.

636
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:29,097
It is.

637
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:31,213
OneMaryQuinn11,

638
00:36:31,238 --> 00:36:32,794
What is your request?

639
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:56,054
What are we doing back here?

640
00:36:57,964 --> 00:36:59,571
When she gets off duty,

641
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:02,779
we corner her, find
a way into that place.

642
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:05,455
Chris is in there, I know it.

643
00:37:05,798 --> 00:37:07,190
Let's just go to the cops first.

644
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:09,241
This is so much bigger
than the cops, Calvin.

645
00:37:09,462 --> 00:37:11,429
The military blew them off, remember?

646
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,531
There's something in there

647
00:37:13,556 --> 00:37:14,996
they do not want them to know about.

648
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,363
Yeah, and we know what that is.

649
00:37:17,388 --> 00:37:18,810
Yeah, sure as hell do.

650
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:23,848
That's the number I called earlier.

651
00:37:24,656 --> 00:37:26,722
Well, answer it, man!
It might be Chris!

652
00:37:32,926 --> 00:37:33,958
Hello?

653
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:35,060
Hello, who's this?

654
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:36,741
Who's this?

655
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,205
It's Donna. You called me?

656
00:37:39,339 --> 00:37:40,579
Sorry. I left my phone at work

657
00:37:40,604 --> 00:37:41,686
and my battery died.

658
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,111
Were you trying to reach me?

659
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:48,279
Who is this?

660
00:37:50,997 --> 00:37:52,096
What the hell are you...

661
00:37:52,165 --> 00:37:53,264
Why'd you do that, man?

662
00:38:01,514 --> 00:38:02,780
What was I supposed to do?

663
00:38:02,956 --> 00:38:05,086
Ask her about Chris?
She's in there with him.

664
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:06,293
We need to get her alone.

665
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,713
She was alone
this morning in the house.

666
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:10,745
You said she wouldn't talk.

667
00:38:17,282 --> 00:38:19,082
Look, I don't know what to do.

668
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:21,272
Okay?

669
00:38:23,682 --> 00:38:25,279
What are we gonna do?

670
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:27,051
Nothing.

671
00:38:27,165 --> 00:38:29,033
We're gonna wait right here,

672
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,982
and we're gonna make her talk.

673
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:49,787
Admiral.

674
00:38:49,903 --> 00:38:51,136
What can I do for you?

675
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:53,233
NSA just sent facial recognition

676
00:38:53,258 --> 00:38:55,874
from your lure's video feed.

677
00:38:56,258 --> 00:38:57,804
We know who found it.

678
00:38:57,863 --> 00:38:59,462
I'm sending it to you now.

679
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:06,055
Benjamin Gregory Pownall, 26 years old,

680
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:09,393
a marine biologist at the Bristol
Cove Mammal Research Center.

681
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,897
It's late.

682
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:22,653
Helen will be asleep.

683
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:24,367
You'll stay here tonight.

684
00:39:40,593 --> 00:39:42,025
Good night.

685
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:52,077
I'm changing protocol.

686
00:40:52,377 --> 00:40:54,440
We're putting a hold
of all extractions.

687
00:40:54,961 --> 00:40:56,547
Are you sure, sir?

688
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:58,586
The admiral seemed to
think accelerating the...

689
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,309
I'll keep him updated.

690
00:41:00,593 --> 00:41:02,972
Testing is suspended indefinitely.

691
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:26,432

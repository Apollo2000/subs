1
00:00:00,127 --> 00:00:01,633
Previously on "Siren".

2
00:00:01,658 --> 00:00:03,060
His death my fault.

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,950
I put the Northstar in danger... Me.

4
00:00:06,062 --> 00:00:08,422
They attacked us.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,243
They tried to kill every one of us

6
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:12,655
on that ship.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,414
You need to keep an eye on Xander.

8
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:16,056
He doesn't look well.

9
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:18,631
If he were to find out
that Ryn is one of them...

10
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:21,344
Hello. I am sorry.

11
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:24,514
- What?
- They kill your father.

12
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,709
All this time, you've been lying to me?

13
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,352
Haida myths, remember?

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,608
About the shape-shifters
who could transform

15
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:32,401
into spirit animals.

16
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:35,382
You know the myths
about a Siren song, right?

17
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:37,067
It gets inside your head.

18
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:38,835
Will you sing to me again?

19
00:00:38,923 --> 00:00:41,591
What are you barking at?

20
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,608
I didn't know this was a nude beach.

21
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:53,887
Breakfast?

22
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:56,937
Ryn. That's her name, right?

23
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:59,533
Yeah. What about her?

24
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:01,299
You think she knows where he is?

25
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:02,909
The one who killed my dad?

26
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:04,667
No, I don't think she does.

27
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:05,785
But she knows where we can find him.

28
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:08,010
Like, out there, wherever he is.

29
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,111
Xander, I know how you must feel,

30
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:14,243
but going after him,
it's not gonna be good.

31
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:16,350
You saw what they're capable of.

32
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,399
You'll find a way through this.

33
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:23,065
A shark.

34
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:25,392
Shark hunts to eat, right?

35
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:28,462
I mean, these things, they attacked us.

36
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:31,195
They came after us with some
kind of sick-ass vengeance.

37
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:33,100
Ryn isn't like that. She changed.

38
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:34,721
If she can, so can the others.

39
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:36,881
Well, if she's so good, then
how come she can't help us?

40
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:39,239
Help you do what? Kill him?

41
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:43,659
Where are you going?

42
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:46,311
I gotta get something
from my mom's, okay?

43
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:48,749
Don't worry, Maddie.

44
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,418
Seriously, I got this.

45
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,935
Hello, Ben.

46
00:03:57,197 --> 00:03:58,464
Hey.

47
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:25,011
Where's Maddie?

48
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,511
She...

49
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:30,657
stayed with Xander last night.

50
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,414
She's trying to make sure
that he's okay.

51
00:04:33,494 --> 00:04:35,462
Is he okay?

52
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,609
I don't know.

53
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:39,413
He's been through a lot.

54
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,013
I am sad for him.

55
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:44,084
Yeah. Me, too.

56
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:48,694
Is Ben okay?

57
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:50,957
Yeah.

58
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:53,754
Ben is good.

59
00:04:57,065 --> 00:04:58,751
How was Sean's memorial?

60
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:01,164
Tough, but good.

61
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:03,290
I think everyone's still in shock.

62
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,537
Xander?

63
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,521
That's part of why I came.

64
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,467
I'm worried about him.

65
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:19,071
Xander?

66
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:21,217
Xander?

67
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:26,442
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

68
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:28,641
I was... Nothin'. I was just...

69
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:31,057
lookin' for a jacket
that Dad had, but...

70
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:34,491
Um, can you do me a favor and
return this to Helen, please?

71
00:05:34,558 --> 00:05:36,890
I've got so many damn dishes
around from people.

72
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:38,325
Ma, it's really not a great time.

73
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:43,389
Not really a great time
for me, either, Xander.

74
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,162
All right, all right. I'll take it.

75
00:05:48,742 --> 00:05:49,942
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,397
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,560
Why did you come back?

78
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,748
- Ryn.
- Who are they?

79
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:24,738
I know what happened on the boat.

80
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:26,910
Were you there?

81
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:28,742
Did you kill him?

82
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:31,278
Sean, he was my friend.

83
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:34,761
We take Ryn back to her home.

84
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:39,219
I thought you only kill for survival,

85
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:43,623
but now... aggression,
plotting, revenge.

86
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,001
You're more human than I realized.

87
00:06:46,194 --> 00:06:48,395
We are her family.

88
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:50,132
She must come back.

89
00:06:50,157 --> 00:06:52,399
What if she doesn't
want to go with you?

90
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:56,536
She seems very attached
to her human friends.

91
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:03,097
Where is Ryn?

92
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,407
I don't know where she is.

93
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,615
Helen should help me.

94
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,257
Ben.

95
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:41,834
My sister is back?

96
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,626
Yeah. She's with two others.

97
00:07:46,238 --> 00:07:48,646
They want me back in the water.

98
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:51,104
What do you want?

99
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,291
I want to choose

100
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:58,058
when I go on land,

101
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,868
when I go in the water.

102
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:02,379
Okay. So that's what we'll tell them.

103
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:06,171
Maybe what I want is not important.

104
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,591
Of course it is.

105
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:09,333
It will be bad.

106
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,258
They will not listen.

107
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:16,028
They will hurt people

108
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:17,484
unless I go back with them.

109
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,016
We can talk to them.

110
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:22,254
If you want to stay, Ryn,
that's your choice.

111
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,637
- It's not theirs.
- It is better if I go.

112
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:27,128
These two with my sister,

113
00:08:27,302 --> 00:08:28,808
I know them.

114
00:08:29,065 --> 00:08:30,663
They are strong.

115
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,706
Hunters.

116
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:34,182
They will keep coming,

117
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:35,751
only more danger.

118
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:37,276
It doesn't have to be like this.

119
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:38,561
We can change it.

120
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:42,897
You can't just go back.

121
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,167
I need you here.

122
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:53,861
I know where my sister will go

123
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:55,194
to look for me.

124
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,736
We will go there

125
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:01,350
before they hurt anymore people.

126
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,923
I'll see you at the house then.

127
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,481
Yeah, sounds good.

128
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:09,864
Have you folks been helped?

129
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,141
We were out on the beach,

130
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,765
when these three nudists assaulted
us and stole our clothes.

131
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:14,824
Nudists?

132
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,258
They were aggressive as hell.

133
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:17,913
One of them shoved
my wife on the ground.

134
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:19,672
You said there were three of them?

135
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:21,296
They seemed like foreigners.

136
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:22,810
They didn't speak much English.

137
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,601
Maybe Europeans.
It's popular there... nudity.

138
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,382
I go with you.

139
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:56,962
I come.

140
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:01,677
Yes.

141
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:11,754
Wait. She said she's gonna go back.

142
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:14,492
That means you all go back, right?

143
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:19,707
Please, no.

144
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:21,360
Ryn, tell me what's goin' on.

145
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:24,738
Not here to take me back.

146
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:27,772
Here to kill.

147
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:35,498
No!

148
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:40,502
We are family.

149
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:41,936
I am you.

150
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:45,095
Family.

151
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:46,642
Yes.

152
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:48,329
We are the same.

153
00:10:58,044 --> 00:10:59,354
You kill her,

154
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:01,224
you kill me, too.

155
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:02,722
Ryn, down!

156
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:09,304
Go, go, go! Let's go!

157
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:16,744
- You okay?
- Yes.

158
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:18,680
Sister okay?

159
00:11:27,835 --> 00:11:29,442
Helen teach me.

160
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:33,083
They tell me

161
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:37,124
they want you to come back to water.

162
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,980
That is all.

163
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:41,821
Not kill.

164
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:43,671
Yes.

165
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:45,098
I know.

166
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:47,715
Why can't they just let you go back?

167
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:49,710
Why do they need to kill you?

168
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:52,059
I spend too much time with humans.

169
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:53,628
Why does that matter?

170
00:11:55,611 --> 00:11:57,137
There was one of us

171
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:58,926
who spent time with a human

172
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:00,829
long time ago.

173
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,518
She lived with him on land.

174
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:06,703
Together, they had little one.

175
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:08,276
- A child?
- Yes.

176
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:11,048
But the child was not normal,

177
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:13,463
not look normal.

178
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:17,366
He took it away from her
into the woods.

179
00:12:17,632 --> 00:12:19,726
He killed their child.

180
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,145
So she went back home in the water.

181
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:26,295
But this made him angry.

182
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:29,157
His head... bad.

183
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:31,318
He brought many men,

184
00:12:31,472 --> 00:12:33,106
and they killed us.

185
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:35,463
So many of us that...

186
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:38,339
the water was red

187
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:40,326
with our blood.

188
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,610
Helen told me that story.

189
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:44,963
Not about a child, though.

190
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,380
Story?

191
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:48,613
No, not story.

192
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:50,084
Real.

193
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,558
You ask me why they don't want me.

194
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:55,915
I am too close to humans. This is why.

195
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,354
We can teach them that you being here

196
00:12:58,454 --> 00:13:00,177
can help with the problems
in the ocean.

197
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:01,640
They don't trust.

198
00:13:02,224 --> 00:13:05,459
They are scared that what happened

199
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,365
will happen again.

200
00:13:07,596 --> 00:13:09,530
They want me dead because they believe

201
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,722
it's the only way they will survive.

202
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:15,309
This is not how we are.

203
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,240
We take care of each other

204
00:13:17,473 --> 00:13:18,773
in the water.

205
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:20,690
But now,

206
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,798
they are afraid of me.

207
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:29,110
It's okay.

208
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,046
- Maddie?
- More of them are here.

209
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:46,245
I know. We just got away from them.

210
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:48,078
They're after Ryn, Maddie.

211
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:49,888
And Donna, too. They want to kill them.

212
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,568
Maybe you should take them somewhere.

213
00:13:51,593 --> 00:13:53,210
- Where?
- I don't know.

214
00:13:53,235 --> 00:13:54,453
Somewhere out of here.

215
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,678
And if we get them away, what then?

216
00:13:56,798 --> 00:13:58,432
Those two are still here.

217
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:02,103
We let them murder people,
destroy the town?

218
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,685
These two are dangerous.

219
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:05,451
They're the ones who killed Sean.

220
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:07,338
We need to keep Ryn safe.

221
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:10,191
Whatever it takes.

222
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:12,219
I'm here with my dad.
I'm gonna talk to him,

223
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:13,417
get the police involved.

224
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:14,875
That's what makes sense here.

225
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:17,671
You guys just wait.

226
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:19,772
Nobody's hurting anyone.

227
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:30,044
Come in.

228
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,503
Hey, Helen.

229
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:36,530
Um, Mom, she wanted
to get this back to you.

230
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:41,737
You know, I wanted to thank you

231
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,330
for everything you've been
doing for her, you know?

232
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:46,020
It means a lot.

233
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,449
What happened to your father
was truly awful.

234
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:51,278
Yeah.

235
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:55,176
Yeah, that's a good word for it.

236
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,219
To witness that, I can...

237
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:59,680
I can only imagine.

238
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:05,346
You know what happened.

239
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:07,505
Yes.

240
00:15:16,972 --> 00:15:18,798
Is there something
you should be telling me?

241
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,427
They said they,

242
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:25,142
came here to, take Ryn back.

243
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,924
But I want you to protect yourself

244
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:29,364
and keep your mum safe.

245
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:33,154
They're here?

246
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,559
Hello.

247
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:47,761
Can I please have my ball back?

248
00:15:57,379 --> 00:15:58,606
Thank you.

249
00:16:14,143 --> 00:16:15,276
Where are you going?

250
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,951
I'm gonna round those things up.

251
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:18,570
I can't have them roamin' around town.

252
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:19,864
Dad, you remember what it was like

253
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:21,885
tryin' to get Ryn in here.
They're very strong.

254
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,711
Well, I'll have
multiple units out there.

255
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:26,275
But what are you gonna do with
them once you've got them?

256
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:27,771
I'll figure that out
when the time comes.

257
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:30,776
Dad, these other deputies, they
can't know what they really are.

258
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,066
They don't have to.

259
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:34,095
We have a drug epidemic on our hands.

260
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,867
They'll just think they're tweakers.

261
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:37,358
They're gonna have questions, Dad.

262
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:38,813
You can't keep them here.

263
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:41,803
I'll think of something.

264
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:51,746
Hello?

265
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,985
Hi, Dr. Decker.

266
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,308
It's Elaine Pownall.

267
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,605
Mrs. Pownall.

268
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,778
You were so kind to recommend me
for the clinical trial,

269
00:16:58,803 --> 00:17:00,812
and I haven't had a chance
to say thank you.

270
00:17:01,065 --> 00:17:02,523
It's no problem at all.

271
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,358
Look, if you could
give me your address,

272
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:06,260
I would love to send you something.

273
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:07,740
It's really not necessary.

274
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,459
Please, I should have done it days ago.

275
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:11,041
Just with the funeral and everything,

276
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:12,500
we've been out of sorts.

277
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,625
Funeral?

278
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:16,202
A local fisherman... Sean McClure?

279
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:18,310
There was a horrible accident.

280
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:20,793
Dr. Decker?

281
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:22,210
When did it happen?

282
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:24,011
About a week ago.

283
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:26,890
It was actually the night
of our fundraising gala.

284
00:17:27,098 --> 00:17:29,040
I have to go.

285
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:31,282
Hello?

286
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:33,166
Hello?

287
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:39,593
Too much waiting.

288
00:17:42,491 --> 00:17:44,866
We're gonna figure out
how to stop them.

289
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:46,153
It's okay.

290
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:55,611
It's okay.

291
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:57,785
Ben is love.

292
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:01,435
Love?

293
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:02,890
Yes.

294
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:14,641
Get... Get down. Down.

295
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:28,042
Ben?

296
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:32,943
Hey. Come in, man.

297
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:37,516
What the hell are you doin'
sittin' in the dark?

298
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,289
What's up?

299
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:42,523
Hello.

300
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:44,885
You.

301
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:48,722
You're the nurse.

302
00:18:48,888 --> 00:18:50,149
This is Ryn's sister.

303
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:51,523
Yeah? No shit.

304
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,129
You were there,

305
00:18:55,557 --> 00:18:56,790
on the boat?

306
00:18:57,613 --> 00:18:59,403
Do you know where he is?

307
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:02,171
The one who killed my dad!
Do you know?!

308
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:03,510
Xander, stop.

309
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:04,979
He's here

310
00:19:05,432 --> 00:19:06,833
to kill us now.

311
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,117
- Xander.
- I'm goin' after him.

312
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:12,787
I'm gonna take him down.

313
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:14,422
Xander, put the gun down.

314
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:15,824
Aw, come on, man.

315
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,797
All I'm askin' is to go after
the thing that killed my dad!

316
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:20,273
You could at least pretend
like you give a damn!

317
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:23,266
- Of course I give...
- Maybe this is what we need to do.

318
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:26,190
What Xander says.

319
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:30,559
Maybe this is the only way.

320
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,951
Yes.

321
00:19:36,252 --> 00:19:39,388
Ryn, are you sure about this?

322
00:19:41,624 --> 00:19:43,658
We will help you find him.

323
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,324
You down with this?

324
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:52,273
Yeah.

325
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,621
We want the same thing.

326
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:58,465
We gotta keep everybody safe.

327
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:04,674
All right. What the hell
we waitin' for then?

328
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:38,923
Unit 244.

329
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:40,425
Suspects in sight.

330
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,600
Request additional units

331
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,113
at Spring Street and Bayview.

332
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,319
Second suspect's in the area.

333
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,312
Consider extremely dangerous.

334
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:52,540
Do not try to subdue her
without backup.

335
00:21:52,565 --> 00:21:53,612
Description?

336
00:21:53,637 --> 00:21:55,776
Female, about 5'7",

337
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,704
dark hair.

338
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:02,307
Dad?

339
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:04,248
I'm bringin' in the male.

340
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:06,122
I'll be back there soon.

341
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:15,459
Maddie?

342
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:17,552
Ben, my dad caught
one of them, the male.

343
00:22:17,682 --> 00:22:18,700
Where?

344
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:20,529
In the alley by the boatyard
on Spring Street.

345
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:22,375
He's bringing him into the station.

346
00:22:22,581 --> 00:22:23,715
Dale's got him.

347
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:24,869
Where is he?

348
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:26,528
You're with Xander?

349
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,487
Yeah.

350
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:30,703
What's he doing there?

351
00:22:30,943 --> 00:22:32,443
We're out looking for them.

352
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:33,858
I'm with Ryn and Donna.

353
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:35,862
Ben, Xander's out of control.

354
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,626
We gotta find the other one.

355
00:22:37,676 --> 00:22:39,247
No, what you need to do
is get back home.

356
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:40,850
Let the police take care of this.

357
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,513
Maddie, I'm handlin' it.

358
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:44,883
No, Ben, damn it, go home! Now!

359
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:47,350
I gotta go.

360
00:22:56,104 --> 00:22:58,564
She was last spotted
near the boatyard on Spring.

361
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,865
But he's the one I want,
all right? Not her!

362
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:02,627
We should get her first.

363
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,210
They already got him, Xander.

364
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:05,903
We know where he is.

365
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,427
You better be right, Ben.

366
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:19,498
We kill them.

367
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,067
And then you stay here.

368
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:24,762
On land.

369
00:23:25,372 --> 00:23:26,805
With Ben.

370
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,183
With Maddie.

371
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:50,262
Hey!

372
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,596
Sit back!

373
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,074
Relax!

374
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,704
No!

375
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:01,699
Settle down!

376
00:24:02,828 --> 00:24:04,062
Sit back!

377
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,587
This is Sheriff Bishop.

378
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,045
Suspect has escaped custody.

379
00:24:35,404 --> 00:24:37,239
Pursuing on foot.

380
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,927
Send backup units to area.

381
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:41,530
Over.

382
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:12,380
Wish we never caught her
in our nets, man.

383
00:25:13,756 --> 00:25:15,245
None of this would have happened.

384
00:25:15,318 --> 00:25:17,019
Dad would still be here.

385
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,461
Hey, we just need
to get rid of these two.

386
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:22,871
Things will get back to normal.

387
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:25,440
Normal?

388
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,449
What's normal now, right?

389
00:25:27,537 --> 00:25:29,284
What, you? You and your mermaid,

390
00:25:29,496 --> 00:25:31,385
livin' happily ever after?

391
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:33,895
Trust me, man. That ain't normal.

392
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,578
Sh...

393
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:45,354
There she is.

394
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:50,599
Don't need to fight.

395
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,291
I don't want to hurt you.

396
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:54,469
And you don't want to hurt me.

397
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,192
You can go back.

398
00:25:57,253 --> 00:25:59,587
We all can live.

399
00:26:03,157 --> 00:26:04,524
Come on, move.

400
00:26:04,586 --> 00:26:07,392
Get out of the way.

401
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:10,049
Just gotta get a clean shot.

402
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:12,862
- Hold it.
- Aw!

403
00:26:14,396 --> 00:26:15,686
Damn it!

404
00:26:41,911 --> 00:26:43,207
You son of a bitch!

405
00:27:00,976 --> 00:27:02,176
Go! Go!

406
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:13,218
Attention all units,

407
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:14,511
10-71 in progress.

408
00:27:14,537 --> 00:27:17,104
Location, southern alley
behind the docks.

409
00:27:24,046 --> 00:27:25,280
Ben?!

410
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:28,093
Ben!

411
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:36,598
Responding to shots fired

412
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:38,458
at Spring Street and Bayview.

413
00:27:47,496 --> 00:27:48,730
Xander.

414
00:27:49,993 --> 00:27:51,943
What are you doin' here?

415
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,390
I heard about your father.

416
00:27:55,578 --> 00:27:57,245
I'm sorry.

417
00:27:58,854 --> 00:28:01,582
I imagine we're both
looking for the same thing.

418
00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:04,784
Mermaids?

419
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:09,037
No... that wasn't a mermaid.

420
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,819
Just a deformed cetacean.

421
00:28:12,621 --> 00:28:14,322
Mermaids don't exist.

422
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:18,152
Don't be shortsighted.

423
00:28:19,568 --> 00:28:21,175
I can help you, Xander.

424
00:28:26,564 --> 00:28:27,956
All right.

425
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,414
Why don't you check down by the docks?

426
00:28:29,438 --> 00:28:31,539
I'll stay here.
Holler if you see anything.

427
00:28:31,747 --> 00:28:32,963
Okay.

428
00:28:34,184 --> 00:28:35,551
You and Ben, man.

429
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:37,930
You're both messed up in the head

430
00:28:37,955 --> 00:28:39,277
over those things?

431
00:28:40,516 --> 00:28:42,540
I'm not the one
walkin' through my hometown

432
00:28:42,565 --> 00:28:45,703
in the middle of the night
with a hunting rifle.

433
00:28:46,422 --> 00:28:48,023
Well, um...

434
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,852
you help me take him down,

435
00:28:51,672 --> 00:28:54,216
you can do whatever the hell
you want with Ryn's sister.

436
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:58,687
What are you plannin' to do with her?

437
00:29:21,697 --> 00:29:23,365
Sheriff, what in God's name?

438
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:25,566
Get inside, Sylvia, now!

439
00:29:33,556 --> 00:29:34,689
Hey.

440
00:29:35,522 --> 00:29:37,859
Look, I know it must be hard,

441
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,828
lettin' your sister stay.

442
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,970
I mean, that'd be a big deal
for a human, too.

443
00:29:43,432 --> 00:29:44,933
Whoa!

444
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:51,619
I see her.

445
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,879
Dad!

446
00:30:02,554 --> 00:30:03,954
What happened to your head?

447
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:06,684
I'm fine. Come on,
you're goin' back home.

448
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:08,476
Have you seen Ben?

449
00:30:09,712 --> 00:30:11,002
Get down.

450
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:18,513
Unh!

451
00:30:24,787 --> 00:30:26,447
God!

452
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:38,099
Maddie! Maddie!

453
00:30:38,134 --> 00:30:39,611
- Is everything okay?
- My dad's been hit!

454
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:40,735
My dad's been hit!

455
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:41,905
I'm okay!

456
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:43,681
All right, we gotta
get you out of here.

457
00:30:43,706 --> 00:30:45,073
We can take him to Helen's.

458
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:49,350
Okay. Go! Go, go!

459
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:06,610
Bring him over here.

460
00:31:06,634 --> 00:31:08,448
All right. On your good leg?

461
00:31:08,473 --> 00:31:09,533
Yeah, that's good.

462
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:13,487
I'm fine, I'm fine!

463
00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:14,667
- Stop fussing!
- Shush!

464
00:31:14,692 --> 00:31:17,078
I'll get some bandages and antiseptic.

465
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:19,256
Listen, we have to stop them

466
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:21,139
before they hurt anyone else.

467
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:23,927
Call Marissa, get all available
units on the street.

468
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:25,067
Okay.

469
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:30,861
- Maddie, wait. Wait.
- What?

470
00:31:30,897 --> 00:31:33,032
I don't think that's a good idea.

471
00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:34,973
If we call the cops now,

472
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:37,516
there's no way we'll
ever contain this thing.

473
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:40,479
It's already out of control.

474
00:31:40,504 --> 00:31:41,584
We have no choice.

475
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:43,849
Okay, and what happens
if the cops find Ryn?

476
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:45,759
What happens then?

477
00:31:46,086 --> 00:31:48,855
Look, we can solve this on our own.

478
00:31:48,936 --> 00:31:49,936
We can protect her.

479
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:51,562
No, we can't.

480
00:31:52,124 --> 00:31:53,380
It's too late.

481
00:31:53,974 --> 00:31:55,329
What is going on with you?

482
00:31:55,354 --> 00:31:56,831
Your judgment is totally screwed up.

483
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:58,218
Don't you care about her?

484
00:31:58,344 --> 00:31:59,612
Of course I do.

485
00:31:59,687 --> 00:32:01,321
Of course I do.

486
00:32:01,526 --> 00:32:03,005
You're the one putting her in danger,

487
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:05,325
going out with Xander
like some crazed vigilante.

488
00:32:05,404 --> 00:32:06,726
You're acting insane.

489
00:32:06,965 --> 00:32:08,274
Yeah.

490
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:10,663
Hey. Where the hell are you going?

491
00:32:10,718 --> 00:32:12,085
To help Ryn.

492
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,151
You go that way.

493
00:33:05,706 --> 00:33:08,148
I just... I just want to help, okay?

494
00:33:08,182 --> 00:33:10,305
Just, please, give me another chance.

495
00:33:10,349 --> 00:33:12,344
Tell me what you want, please.

496
00:33:12,473 --> 00:33:13,718
Move.

497
00:34:55,796 --> 00:34:57,230
No!

498
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,605
You listen to me now.

499
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,052
What's going on?

500
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,092
It's a matriarchy.

501
00:35:36,182 --> 00:35:39,005
It seems Ryn's now the dominant female.

502
00:35:41,381 --> 00:35:43,348
It's over?

503
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,052
Yes.

504
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:49,282
Xander, wait!

505
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:51,096
Stay where you are, Ben!

506
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:53,269
Man, you don't want to do this!

507
00:35:53,631 --> 00:35:54,667
It's settled!

508
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:55,721
It's done!

509
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:56,823
Not for me.

510
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:58,658
Drop it, Xander!

511
00:35:58,692 --> 00:36:00,126
They're animals, Sheriff!

512
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:02,262
They're animals who kill humans.

513
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:05,832
Doing this is not gonna
bring your dad back.

514
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:09,140
It's only gonna cause
more trouble, man.

515
00:36:10,824 --> 00:36:12,140
Xander, please.

516
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:19,178
Stop!

517
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,737
No!

518
00:36:46,828 --> 00:36:48,758
My place. Go!

519
00:36:48,793 --> 00:36:50,430
Quick, quick.

520
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,233
You go back.

521
00:37:11,275 --> 00:37:12,995
Never come again.

522
00:37:34,572 --> 00:37:38,942
They're taking Donna back to Helen's.

523
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,071
Are you coming?

524
00:37:41,391 --> 00:37:43,647
I'm gonna stay with my dad right now.

525
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:44,807
I'll...

526
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,216
I'll be by later.

527
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,984
- Maddie.
- For Ryn.

528
00:37:48,986 --> 00:37:50,060
Go.

529
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:51,461
They need you.

530
00:37:56,386 --> 00:37:58,495
Ben, I can help.

531
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,906
Not now.

532
00:37:59,964 --> 00:38:01,460
She doesn't want you.

533
00:38:06,877 --> 00:38:08,144
Your leg, Sheriff.

534
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:09,303
I'll be fine.

535
00:38:09,327 --> 00:38:11,228
- Happened in the crash?
- Yeah.

536
00:38:11,302 --> 00:38:13,470
Deer jumped right out
in front of my vehicle.

537
00:38:15,886 --> 00:38:17,347
The deer is fine.

538
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:18,855
Not a scratch.

539
00:38:20,524 --> 00:38:22,425
We'll keep Xander in the drunk tank.

540
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,790
Give him a day to cool off.

541
00:38:23,847 --> 00:38:25,207
Wait, you're not gonna charge him?

542
00:38:25,232 --> 00:38:27,033
For bein' a grief-stricken jackass?

543
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,597
No, I'm not.

544
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:40,830
Gosh.

545
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:46,449
How is she?

546
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:50,170
Not good.

547
00:38:52,823 --> 00:38:54,057
The others?

548
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,716
I send them back

549
00:38:55,772 --> 00:38:56,906
to the water.

550
00:38:57,261 --> 00:38:58,928
They will say I'm dead.

551
00:39:00,211 --> 00:39:01,845
When she's better,

552
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:03,799
she will go home.

553
00:39:08,192 --> 00:39:10,026
We can't take her to a hospital.

554
00:39:10,274 --> 00:39:13,576
They wouldn't know how to
treat one of her kind anyway.

555
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:39,402
More coffee?

556
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,407
How are you feeling?

557
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:52,542
You keep treating me this well,

558
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,907
I'll never go back to work.

559
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:57,120
Yeah, that'll happen.

560
00:40:02,331 --> 00:40:04,212
Those creatures, Maddie,

561
00:40:04,562 --> 00:40:06,565
they can't be here.

562
00:40:07,784 --> 00:40:09,585
I know.

563
00:40:12,136 --> 00:40:13,381
But they can learn.

564
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:15,110
Evolve just like Ryn did.

565
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:20,036
I don't want to have to choose a side,

566
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:22,197
but if I do,

567
00:40:22,627 --> 00:40:24,424
this town comes first.

568
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,055
She's getting worse.

569
00:40:34,258 --> 00:40:36,288
We need to do something.

570
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:38,210
Ryn?

571
00:40:38,456 --> 00:40:40,456
Now, it's a long shot,

572
00:40:41,427 --> 00:40:43,947
but there is someone
who might be able to help.

573
00:40:46,396 --> 00:40:48,931
Someone who has your sister's blood.

574
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,193
Stem cells.

575
00:40:52,454 --> 00:40:54,196
I can make the call.

576
00:40:59,115 --> 00:41:01,461
Okay. Yes.

577
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:16,238
- Hello?
- Dr. Decker, it's Ben.

578
00:41:18,038 --> 00:41:19,308
We need you.

579
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:34,081

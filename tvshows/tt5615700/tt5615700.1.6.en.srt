1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,137
Previously on Siren...

2
00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:02,508
Ryn's back.

3
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:04,890
Why on earth
would she come back?

4
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:10,140
We need help.

5
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:11,221
It's getting worse, isn't it?

6
00:00:11,222 --> 00:00:12,591
What's happening?

7
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:14,302
They're starving them out,
Maddie.

8
00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:16,182
The government's
letting it happen.

9
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,803
They're making it happen.

10
00:00:17,804 --> 00:00:20,645
Seems a young woman assaulted
a 250-pound dock worker.

11
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:23,594
We need the people.

12
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:25,935
- Them take!
- No. No, no, no, no!

13
00:00:25,936 --> 00:00:27,357
Whoa!

14
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:31,097
- Hey!
- Ryn!

15
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,518
Water! Now!

16
00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:34,519
Any sign of them?

17
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:35,519
You?

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,769
Yes, you can trust me.

19
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,359
This Decker guy.

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,521
He's the one we gotta
watch out for.

21
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:50,558
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back Million
Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday.

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,281
Aah!

23
00:01:18,993 --> 00:01:20,743
- There you go.
- Thank you.

24
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:27,785
Maddie, you tell me
story about mother.

25
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:29,415
That's right.

26
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,376
Your mother is gone.

27
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:33,376
When Ryn was young,

28
00:01:33,377 --> 00:01:35,617
mother died.

29
00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:38,288
Sister took care of me always.

30
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:41,209
But now she is alone.

31
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,790
She's hungry and frightened.

32
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,080
Ryn.

33
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:49,211
She will be out in the night

34
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:51,752
to find food.

35
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:53,423
She's hunting?

36
00:01:53,424 --> 00:01:56,335
Yes, she will hunt.

37
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:45,769
Officer Montero,
what can I do for you?

38
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,480
Just wanted
to give you the heads up, sir,

39
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:49,900
that the Admiral
was in looking for you.

40
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,901
What'd you tell him?

41
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:53,481
Nothing.

42
00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:55,602
I got the feeling
you might be following up

43
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:57,693
on your... suspect,

44
00:02:57,694 --> 00:03:00,144
but noticed that your trip
wasn't on the roster.

45
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:02,604
Just wanted
to let you know, sir.

46
00:03:02,605 --> 00:03:04,565
I appreciate
your discretion, Montero.

47
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:05,906
I'm here to help, sir.

48
00:05:07,945 --> 00:05:09,774
You see this?

49
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:12,605
The Chronicle called out
Pownall Seafood by name

50
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:14,025
for overfishing.

51
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:15,736
Your dad's gonna love that.

52
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:18,027
Yeah. Well,
he'll love it even more

53
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:20,528
when I tell him he's
gotta bring the boats in.

54
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,068
The government's
giving him free rein.

55
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:23,318
He's not gonna
back down so easily.

56
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,110
Well, I gotta give him
a good reason to.

57
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:28,990
Ryn?

58
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:30,361
It's gonna be okay.

59
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:32,241
We're gonna work it out
for you and your sister.

60
00:05:32,242 --> 00:05:35,242
My sister not trust me.

61
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:38,153
Look, if we show her
we can help your people,

62
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:40,114
get them the food they need,
she'll change her mind.

63
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:42,034
We just need to be careful.

64
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:45,155
She attacked someone
at the fishery the other night.

65
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:46,577
The police could be
looking for you.

66
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:51,458
Yes... Maddie.

67
00:05:54,459 --> 00:06:00,540
All right, I got one
coffee, sugar and soy.

68
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:04,751
One fish, head and tail.

69
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:06,962
All right,
I gotta get out of here.

70
00:06:06,963 --> 00:06:09,124
- Maddie?
- Love you.

71
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:17,166
I love you.

72
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:24,879
Okay, so that just happened.

73
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,590
I got one the other day.

74
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:46,304
Where did you go last night?

75
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:50,137
You and your sister have
the same mysterious habits.

76
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:55,218
She's a bit chattier, though.

77
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,180
You don't like it here. I know.

78
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:05,770
Ryn.

79
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:07,891
You want to see her?

80
00:07:07,892 --> 00:07:09,183
I can arrange that.

81
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:14,144
Maybe you can talk
some sense into her.

82
00:07:23,607 --> 00:07:25,857
Every fishery
out there's taking advantage

83
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:27,277
of these lax regulations.

84
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:28,229
Why they gotta
single us out by name?

85
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,568
It's unbelievable.

86
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:31,148
We're the biggest.

87
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:32,279
Of course they're
gonna call us out.

88
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,029
Are you saying it's fair

89
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,190
that we're being portrayed
as the bad guy here?

90
00:07:35,191 --> 00:07:38,031
We are the bad guy here.

91
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:39,232
But we don't have to be.

92
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,403
What are you sayin'?

93
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:47,233
Show them that, even though the
government is lax on conservation,

94
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,285
Pownall Seafood isn't.

95
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:52,365
That could be a way
to spin this.

96
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:54,117
No, I'm saying we could
actually do it.

97
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:57,077
How?

98
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:59,407
Our product does great
at warehouse groceries,

99
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:01,868
but we don't sell
to high-end natural markets.

100
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:04,199
- We're bigger than that.
- You know how much Salmon we sell to Kroger?

101
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,699
Yes, but do you know
how much a pound

102
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,290
of sustainable line-caught
Coho costs at Whole Foods?

103
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,371
Well, we never really romanced
those guys, the high-enders.

104
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:14,242
Eco-friendly fishing equals
a higher price per pound.

105
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,702
I've checked the numbers.

106
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,243
Our profit margin
goes up six percent.

107
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:19,914
Six percent?

108
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:23,296
That before or after
my donation to Greenpeace?

109
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,417
Ben?

110
00:08:29,418 --> 00:08:30,667
Why don't you come to your
mother's event tonight,

111
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:32,508
her fundraiser thingy?

112
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:34,668
I can't. I got
too much stuff to do.

113
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:37,509
She just got turned down
by another clinical trial.

114
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,510
You know your mother
would never mention it,

115
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:41,801
but her spirits
are pretty low, and...

116
00:08:41,802 --> 00:08:44,461
Well, I know that having you and
Doug there would give her a boost.

117
00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:46,802
Come, and in the meantime,
I promise you,

118
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:49,304
I'll really think
about what you said here.

119
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:54,845
- Hi.
- Hey.

120
00:08:54,846 --> 00:08:56,256
Thanks for the call.

121
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,516
How'd she end up here?

122
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:01,348
I went out and found her.

123
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:05,928
What is up with you and them?

124
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:08,309
Well, maybe
they sense my empathy.

125
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,350
The perpetual outsider.

126
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,760
How do you know
so much about them?

127
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:13,260
There's something
you're not telling us.

128
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,351
There's a lot
I'm not telling you.

129
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:17,763
Like what? Helen, you need...

130
00:09:21,024 --> 00:09:22,894
Should we be worried?

131
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,479
No more fight.

132
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:48,271
A tea party?

133
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:50,322
It's chamomile.

134
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,483
Might calm them down.

135
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:54,273
Why don't we all sit?

136
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:55,405
Go.

137
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:59,155
I talk to sister.

138
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:00,575
Are you sure?

139
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:02,536
Go.

140
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:03,946
Let's let them
work it out alone.

141
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:05,947
In my apartment?

142
00:10:05,948 --> 00:10:08,329
Damn.

143
00:11:06,257 --> 00:11:08,297
How can I help you?

144
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:11,888
I'm looking for Ben Pownall.

145
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:13,678
He's not here today.

146
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,469
Do you know
where I might find him?

147
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,179
Can I ask who's asking?

148
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,470
A fellow biologist

149
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,471
interested in his work
in Steller feeding patterns.

150
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,221
Ben's the man for that for sure.

151
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:26,512
Yeah. So do you know
when he'll be back?

152
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:28,303
Not today.

153
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:29,513
He's got a thing.

154
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:31,264
A thing?

155
00:11:31,265 --> 00:11:33,804
Yeah. Some big old
charity hoo-ha thing

156
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:35,066
his parents are throwing.

157
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:40,306
Thank you.

158
00:11:40,307 --> 00:11:41,898
I'll try back later.

159
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,689
They will help us.

160
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,690
Ben and Maddie.

161
00:11:50,691 --> 00:11:52,440
They will bring back our food.

162
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:55,021
I see his face

163
00:11:55,022 --> 00:11:57,862
in that place take our food.

164
00:11:57,863 --> 00:11:59,402
That was not him.

165
00:11:59,403 --> 00:12:02,233
That was his father.

166
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:03,524
Ben will help.

167
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,365
No!

168
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:09,576
You help him,

169
00:12:09,577 --> 00:12:10,656
not me.

170
00:12:10,657 --> 00:12:12,278
You try to kill him.

171
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:15,278
So I help.

172
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,910
You

173
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,582
like human.

174
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,583
You...

175
00:12:30,703 --> 00:12:32,454
like...

176
00:12:33,824 --> 00:12:35,125
human.

177
00:12:44,037 --> 00:12:45,707
Drugs.

178
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,378
- Ya think?
- Yeah.

179
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:48,998
But it must be somethin' new.

180
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:52,589
Young women, small stature,

181
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,790
similar crimes.

182
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,920
These two might have been
on the same crank.

183
00:12:56,921 --> 00:12:59,711
Tweaked out and flyin' high.

184
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,043
There's some connection here.

185
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:08,794
Since when does it take two
days to fix an intake manifold?

186
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:10,595
Mechanics charge by the hour.

187
00:13:10,596 --> 00:13:12,465
Yeah, well, it sucks.

188
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:13,836
I mean, I just get back to work,

189
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:15,546
and then your dad's
engine conks out.

190
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:17,388
Well, sucks worse for my dad.

191
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:22,680
- That's him.
- Who?

192
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,010
The guy from the military place.

193
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:28,641
What, the guy
that found you in Alaska?

194
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:31,181
Are you sure?

195
00:13:31,182 --> 00:13:32,603
Yeah.

196
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:36,604
What the hell is he doin' here?

197
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:39,974
And you're sure it was him?

198
00:13:39,975 --> 00:13:43,145
Like Jesus himself, man.

199
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:44,805
What's he doin' in town?

200
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:46,806
You think he's lookin' for me?

201
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:49,147
If he was, you'd know about it.

202
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:50,477
Tell him what you told me.

203
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:53,058
Yeah. So, well, in Alaska,

204
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:56,979
this Decker, he's askin' all
about this psycho nurse, right?

205
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,190
And then as he's leavin', he...

206
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:03,771
leans in and he...
he asks if she sang to me?

207
00:14:03,772 --> 00:14:05,482
Sang?

208
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:06,812
Yeah.

209
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,064
Sang.

210
00:14:09,854 --> 00:14:13,355
I mean, this guy's
a total weirdo, right?

211
00:14:16,316 --> 00:14:18,487
I gotta take a leak, all right?

212
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,658
So, you know when I told you

213
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,859
that this... this Decker guy's
after my mermaid?

214
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,699
Yeah, I got
your drunk message, man.

215
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,820
Well, you gotta
ask yourself why.

216
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:33,701
I mean, why is he here

217
00:14:33,702 --> 00:14:34,741
in Bristol Cove?

218
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:36,742
I mean, what's he doin'?

219
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:41,823
So here's my, crazy
not-so-crazy answer.

220
00:14:41,824 --> 00:14:45,996
Decker's here
because the mermaid is here.

221
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:55,918
He was writing
about the possibility

222
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,959
of aquatic humanoids all the
way back in the nineties.

223
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,789
This is the guy, Maddie.

224
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,130
I know it.

225
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:05,171
Bounced around several
universities until 2008.

226
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,921
And then?

227
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:09,962
Nada. Just disappeared.

228
00:15:09,963 --> 00:15:14,964
Okay, so those schools didn't want
Decker and his mermaid theories,

229
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:17,425
but the Navy did.

230
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:21,426
I mean, he went all the way
to Alaska to look for Donna.

231
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:25,087
Now he shows up
in Bristol Cove? Why?

232
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:26,507
You think he knows she's here?

233
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,428
He's got to, right?

234
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,760
He's connected
to the overfishing, too.

235
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,801
Maddie?

236
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:38,552
He's not gonna stop
until he finds her.

237
00:15:41,593 --> 00:15:43,473
Babe.

238
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:45,054
What is it?

239
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:48,975
Decker asked Chris

240
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:51,886
if she sang to him.

241
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:53,436
Sang?

242
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:54,886
It's something they do.

243
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,187
You know the myths
about a Siren song, right?

244
00:15:58,188 --> 00:16:00,688
Only it's not a song exactly.

245
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:04,099
It gets inside your head.

246
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,100
I don't know, maybe it's
some kind of defense mechanism.

247
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:08,692
How do you know all this?

248
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:12,652
Because Ryn did it to me

249
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:14,103
the night we met.

250
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:18,524
And you're
just telling me this now?

251
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,894
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:23,026
It was...

253
00:16:24,657 --> 00:16:26,066
I wasn't sure what it meant,

254
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,737
and I'm still not.

255
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,987
What did it feel like?

256
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:34,199
Honestly, like a drug.

257
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,489
I can't explain it.

258
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,951
It's like something I need.

259
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:07,329
Would you mind going over
and getting a cup of water?

260
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,410
Your mom's not gonna
be happy to see me.

261
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:11,330
I totally ditched her
at lunch the other day.

262
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,711
No. I'm sure she's
already forgotten about it.

263
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:15,371
Yeah, 'cause that's her M.O.?

264
00:17:15,372 --> 00:17:18,502
And I think that was you.

265
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,503
I'm gonna need to hit the bar.

266
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:23,004
Okay.

267
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:25,876
Ben! Good to see you.

268
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:36,678
Bourbon, please.

269
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:37,679
Hi, Maddie.

270
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,589
Hey, Mr. Pownall.

271
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,341
Call me Ted, please.

272
00:17:42,971 --> 00:17:44,921
Beautiful party...

273
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:46,181
Ted.

274
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:47,802
Elaine puts on a hell of a show.

275
00:17:47,803 --> 00:17:49,012
How's your dad doin'?

276
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:50,843
He's okay.

277
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:52,843
Been down in Forks with my aunt.

278
00:17:52,844 --> 00:17:54,134
Thanks. She's sick.

279
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:56,134
Well, sorry to hear that.

280
00:17:56,135 --> 00:17:57,926
That explains the spike
in crime around here.

281
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,020
Excuse me.

282
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:14,270
Hey, Mom.

283
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:15,810
Hi, Ben.

284
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:17,811
- It's so good to see you.
- You, too.

285
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:20,022
I want you to meet someone.

286
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:22,933
I was just talking
to the most brilliant doctor.

287
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:24,063
It's such a coincidence.

288
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:26,024
He's a marine biologist, too,

289
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:28,024
and he loves Chopin.

290
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:29,936
Aldon Decker.

291
00:18:31,646 --> 00:18:32,897
Ben Pownall.

292
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,108
We go back a long way,
your dad and I.

293
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:40,398
The night Elaine and I
had our accident,

294
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:41,568
he was the first one
on the scene.

295
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:42,989
Did you know that?

296
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,860
- He never told me that.
- No? Well, he was.

297
00:18:45,861 --> 00:18:47,570
He didn't leave my side.

298
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:50,991
He stayed up with me
all night at the hospital

299
00:18:50,992 --> 00:18:52,572
while Elaine was in surgery.

300
00:18:52,573 --> 00:18:54,242
That sounds like him.

301
00:18:54,243 --> 00:18:55,574
He's a good man, your dad.

302
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:59,115
He says the same thing
about you.

303
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:06,786
Dr. Decker was just telling
me about his research.

304
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:11,748
Your mother's referring to a rare
marine creature I discovered recently.

305
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:13,448
A marine creature?

306
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:15,869
Its stem cells are remarkable.

307
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,710
Maybe now is not the time.

308
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:19,330
No. No, no, dear.

309
00:19:19,331 --> 00:19:21,251
It sounds fascinating.
Please go on.

310
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:24,082
Well, I injected the DNA cells
from the specimen

311
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,712
into a group of paralytic rats.

312
00:19:25,713 --> 00:19:28,083
In the weeks since,
the control rats have all died

313
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,084
due to complications
from the paralysis.

314
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,714
But the others,

315
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:34,125
the ones I injected
the creature DNA with,

316
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:36,667
every one of them
regained their mobility.

317
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:41,837
Mom, need anything?

318
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:43,509
Apparently some
of those stem cells.

319
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,550
Your home

320
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:52,262
not here.

321
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:56,132
In the water.

322
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:58,303
We will die,

323
00:19:58,304 --> 00:19:59,343
all of us.

324
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:01,884
No food. We need them.

325
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:04,595
You need them.

326
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:12,307
I know man do this to you,

327
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:13,557
but not Ben.

328
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:14,678
Not Maddie.

329
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,849
No human help me.

330
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,930
They...

331
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:25,061
hurt!

332
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:26,142
Pain!

333
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:29,142
And you,

334
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:30,143
sister,

335
00:20:31,974 --> 00:20:34,185
choose them.

336
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:37,316
They do this to you?

337
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:42,606
I hunt at top of water.

338
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:44,318
You follow.

339
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:48,238
I am sorry.

340
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,740
Sorry?

341
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:01,322
So your mother told me that
you have a graduate degree

342
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:03,193
from the University
of Washington,

343
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:05,364
that you interned with some
of the top marine biologists.

344
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:06,784
You shouldn't
have said that to her.

345
00:21:06,785 --> 00:21:08,444
Said what?

346
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:10,905
There's no magic bullet
to cure paralysis,

347
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:14,077
and you dangling that out
in front of her is not okay.

348
00:21:15,248 --> 00:21:16,577
I'm sorry.

349
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:18,408
My apologies.

350
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:21,579
Look, you seem
like a smart young man,

351
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,250
and my research would
greatly benefit your mother.

352
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:29,411
If you could just
help me with my work.

353
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:30,873
Beer, please.

354
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,543
I know why you're in town,

355
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:35,873
and I know what you want.

356
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:37,874
I doubt that very much.

357
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,045
Thank you.

358
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:42,376
I know what she did to you.

359
00:21:44,757 --> 00:21:46,336
H... How do you know?

360
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:48,337
Excuse the interruption,

361
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:50,498
but Mom's about to get acknowledged
for her fundraising prowess

362
00:21:50,499 --> 00:21:51,798
in T-minus ten.

363
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:54,049
Sure, Doug, I'm comin'.

364
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,340
Mom comes first.

365
00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:06,263
Sidney, you gotta
get to the church.

366
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:07,763
Shelter doors close at ten.

367
00:22:07,764 --> 00:22:10,385
It's warm. I'm sleeping out.

368
00:22:12,426 --> 00:22:15,175
I've seen that girl.

369
00:22:15,176 --> 00:22:17,506
She's been around town.

370
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:19,467
Where?

371
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:21,507
In the alley one night
with some kids.

372
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:22,509
Who?

373
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,888
I'm not sure,

374
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:25,809
but I remember her,

375
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,429
because a while back,

376
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,890
I saw her up on the North Star.

377
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:30,310
McClure's boat?

378
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:32,271
Yeah.

379
00:22:32,272 --> 00:22:36,272
One morning I saw her
sniffin' around.

380
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:37,682
Thanks, Sidney.

381
00:22:37,683 --> 00:22:39,684
Remind me to come
to you first next time.

382
00:22:41,355 --> 00:22:43,274
- Decker's here.
- What?

383
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,145
Yeah. He's looking for Donna.

384
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:46,565
Ben, he's dangerous.

385
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:47,567
You think he knows about Ryn?

386
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:49,396
It doesn't seem like it.

387
00:22:49,397 --> 00:22:52,357
This guy's... We don't know
what he's capable of.

388
00:22:52,358 --> 00:22:54,778
We just gotta stay
one step ahead of him.

389
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:58,319
Hey, have you seen Dr. Decker?

390
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,400
I was just about
to go look for him.

391
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:03,691
Excuse me.

392
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:04,782
Elaine.

393
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:08,692
Um, Mrs. Pownall, about lunch.

394
00:23:08,693 --> 00:23:10,523
I know we didn't get off
to the best start...

395
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:11,983
Maddie. Maddie, don't worry.

396
00:23:11,984 --> 00:23:14,155
I just want what's best
for my son.

397
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:21,657
Just tell me,
do you know where she is?

398
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:24,577
Maybe.

399
00:23:24,578 --> 00:23:26,078
You need to bring me to her.

400
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,288
Please, right now.

401
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:29,489
I'd like to help you, really.

402
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,490
I would.

403
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,490
But I need something
from you first.

404
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:35,330
You do realize

405
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,201
I have the power of
the military behind me?

406
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:39,742
If all you needed to do
was snap your fingers

407
00:23:39,743 --> 00:23:41,412
and the government
showed up to help you,

408
00:23:41,413 --> 00:23:44,623
then why haven't they?

409
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:48,455
I think you want
to find her, right?

410
00:23:48,456 --> 00:23:49,996
But you don't want
them to find her.

411
00:23:53,537 --> 00:23:55,627
I think we can make a deal.

412
00:23:55,628 --> 00:23:56,798
You and me.

413
00:23:58,419 --> 00:23:59,538
Stop it.

414
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,839
Call it off.

415
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,090
Starving them, the lures,

416
00:24:04,091 --> 00:24:05,540
whatever else you got planned,

417
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,302
stop it all right now.

418
00:24:09,342 --> 00:24:11,042
That's a big ask.

419
00:24:11,043 --> 00:24:12,342
Hardly comparable.

420
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:13,503
Really?

421
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:17,504
'Cause I know what it's like

422
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:20,096
to have her inside your head.

423
00:24:23,427 --> 00:24:24,886
You can't sleep,

424
00:24:24,887 --> 00:24:27,138
you can't think
about anything else.

425
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,720
She sang to you, too?

426
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:43,433
Hello, Helen.

427
00:24:44,513 --> 00:24:46,433
You scared me, dear.

428
00:24:46,434 --> 00:24:49,724
How's everything goin' up there?

429
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:51,515
I haven't heard anything break.

430
00:24:54,516 --> 00:24:56,726
What's wrong?

431
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:59,727
My sister

432
00:24:59,728 --> 00:25:00,608
is strong.

433
00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:03,438
A hunter,

434
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:07,519
but this man,

435
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,111
he hurt her.

436
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:12,561
She will be better

437
00:25:12,562 --> 00:25:15,062
once she's away from him.

438
00:25:15,063 --> 00:25:16,563
No.

439
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:24,236
Not better.

440
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:27,197
Sometimes...

441
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:32,367
something inside you
gets broken,

442
00:25:32,368 --> 00:25:35,568
and no matter what you do,

443
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:37,119
it can't be fixed.

444
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,530
The feeling stays with you.

445
00:25:53,415 --> 00:25:55,995
You want to see her again?

446
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:58,416
Tell me what's
going on out there.

447
00:26:05,078 --> 00:26:06,629
Okay.

448
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,459
There's a government trawler

449
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,289
off the coast
of Bristol Cove right now,

450
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,290
out past the Northern Break.

451
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,541
We starve them to the surface,

452
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:16,841
the lures will attract them,

453
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:20,292
and the trawler will
start harvesting them.

454
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:22,384
When?

455
00:26:23,844 --> 00:26:24,885
Tonight.

456
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:38,428
Hello.

457
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:40,048
Are Ryn and Donna still there?

458
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:41,799
Yes. Why? What's goin' on?

459
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,929
All right, listen to me.

460
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,430
Do not let them go out, okay?

461
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:47,471
There's a man looking for them.

462
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,681
Ryn's sister needs
to get back to the water.

463
00:26:49,682 --> 00:26:51,592
We'll deal with it
as soon as we get there.

464
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:53,264
Can you just put Ryn on?

465
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:56,515
It's for you.

466
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:03,806
Hello? Yes.

467
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:05,686
Ryn, it's not safe outside.

468
00:27:05,687 --> 00:27:07,597
You need to stay inside.

469
00:27:07,598 --> 00:27:10,188
That man from the lab,

470
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:11,728
he's here at the party.

471
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:12,899
- Man?
- Yes!

472
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,690
The bad man who hurt Donna.

473
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:17,771
He's here. He's looking for her.

474
00:27:19,362 --> 00:27:21,771
You have to stay
at Helen's, okay?

475
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:23,863
Ryn!

476
00:27:24,903 --> 00:27:26,104
Okay, yes.

477
00:27:27,864 --> 00:27:29,195
Thank you.

478
00:27:58,534 --> 00:28:00,414
Where's my damn mermaid?

479
00:28:00,415 --> 00:28:01,454
Excuse me?

480
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:02,744
Let me refresh your memory.

481
00:28:02,745 --> 00:28:04,325
Your goons stole her.

482
00:28:04,326 --> 00:28:06,375
From my boat, the North Star?

483
00:28:06,376 --> 00:28:08,206
You have me mistaken
with somebody else.

484
00:28:08,207 --> 00:28:10,247
Here's what I think.

485
00:28:10,248 --> 00:28:12,577
You took my friend Chris
and the mermaid to your place,

486
00:28:12,578 --> 00:28:14,168
lab, prison, whatever it was,

487
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:17,419
then Chris,
he manages to get out.

488
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,789
Takes that crazy nurse with him,

489
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,830
drives her all the way
to Libbey Beach.

490
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:23,291
Then, poof!

491
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:25,882
That nurse disappeared,

492
00:28:25,883 --> 00:28:27,422
and then you,

493
00:28:27,423 --> 00:28:31,463
you spend a whole month
tracking Chris down to Alaska

494
00:28:31,464 --> 00:28:33,794
to ask him about her.

495
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,546
Why?

496
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:39,336
It's 'cause I think...

497
00:28:39,337 --> 00:28:41,967
I think that that nurse

498
00:28:41,968 --> 00:28:44,128
is the mermaid.

499
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,798
There's no mermaid.
There never was.

500
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:50,049
- Bullshit.
- A deformed cetacean.

501
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,219
I know what I saw!

502
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,050
Do you?

503
00:28:54,051 --> 00:28:55,841
You believe you caught something

504
00:28:55,842 --> 00:28:58,052
that never in man's 50,000 years

505
00:28:58,053 --> 00:29:00,012
of sailing the ocean's
ever been corroborated.

506
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:02,013
No one knew there were cavemen,
either, until they did.

507
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:03,763
No mermaid's skeleton's
ever been found.

508
00:29:03,764 --> 00:29:05,474
No dead one's ever
floated up to the surface.

509
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:09,305
In fact, there's no evidence
of their existence whatsoever.

510
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:11,226
That doesn't mean
they're not real.

511
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:13,226
'Cause you caught one, right?

512
00:29:13,227 --> 00:29:15,517
A live one.

513
00:29:15,518 --> 00:29:19,058
Xander McClure
from Bristol Cove.

514
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:20,849
Yeah.

515
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,060
And now she's cavorting,
around town with your friends,

516
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:26,772
driving in cars with them.

517
00:29:27,852 --> 00:29:29,481
Hmph!

518
00:29:29,482 --> 00:29:32,773
You must be a very,
very special man, Mr. McClure.

519
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:35,984
And have
some very special friends.

520
00:29:44,027 --> 00:29:45,857
Where'd he go?

521
00:29:45,858 --> 00:29:47,067
I don't know.

522
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:48,448
I'll check outside.

523
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:53,989
I'm bringin' in the boats.

524
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,149
What?

525
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,650
I asked Marty
to run the numbers,

526
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:57,950
and you were right...
Six percent.

527
00:29:57,951 --> 00:29:59,701
And it'll help
improve our image.

528
00:29:59,702 --> 00:30:01,151
If I'm gonna be in the paper,

529
00:30:01,152 --> 00:30:02,912
it damn well better be
for something good.

530
00:30:02,913 --> 00:30:04,913
Thanks, Dad.

531
00:30:04,914 --> 00:30:06,954
- Doug?
- No problem.

532
00:30:17,247 --> 00:30:19,497
Hey, Mom?

533
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:21,158
Have you seen Dr. Decker?

534
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:23,748
Um, I'm sure he's around,

535
00:30:23,749 --> 00:30:25,709
but, um, would you sit with me?

536
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,999
Please?

537
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,371
Yeah, of course. Of course.

538
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:33,582
I was turned down again
for another clinical trial.

539
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,082
Did you dad tell you?

540
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,663
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

541
00:30:37,664 --> 00:30:38,873
Did you have something to do

542
00:30:38,874 --> 00:30:40,504
with Dr. Decker coming to town?

543
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,875
Me? No.

544
00:30:43,506 --> 00:30:46,165
Well, he's very enthusiastic
about his research,

545
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,926
but I want you to know,

546
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:49,086
I don't need it.

547
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:52,127
- Mom.
- No, I... Let me finish, okay?

548
00:30:52,128 --> 00:30:54,878
I know I'm never
getting out of this chair,

549
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:56,799
and I'm okay with it,

550
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,589
but I'm really, really touched

551
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,800
that you still
want to help me, Ben.

552
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:03,052
I thought you'd given up on me.

553
00:31:10,844 --> 00:31:12,175
- Hi.
- Hello.

554
00:31:41,394 --> 00:31:43,273
I'll see you later.

555
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:44,395
Yeah, I know what you mean.

556
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:48,775
Maddie? Sorry.

557
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:50,857
- Excuse me.
- What? Sorry.

558
00:32:18,155 --> 00:32:19,326
It's you.

559
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:26,827
I'm so happy to see you.

560
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:29,498
I'm so sorry
about what happened.

561
00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:31,960
I never meant to hurt you.

562
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,250
I should have found
a better way to study you.

563
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:38,252
Please just give me
one more chance.

564
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,704
What's happening?

565
00:32:46,084 --> 00:32:47,294
There's two of you?

566
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:08,711
What's goin' on?!

567
00:33:10,172 --> 00:33:13,632
- Ryn?
- He hurt my sister!

568
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:17,593
Please. I'm not gonna
hurt you, I promise.

569
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:20,215
Aah! Aah!

570
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:24,386
Ryn! Stop!

571
00:33:27,557 --> 00:33:29,268
No, Ryn! Wait!

572
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,177
No! I kill him.

573
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:34,098
He hurt my sister!

574
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:35,388
I know. I know he did.

575
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:36,599
Please!

576
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,980
Ryn? Ryn, wait, please!

577
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,391
You want it to stop?
Call it off!

578
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:45,182
Whatever's goin' on
out there, stop it!

579
00:33:45,183 --> 00:33:47,182
- Bring in that trawler!
- Ryn, think!

580
00:33:47,183 --> 00:33:49,023
It's not just you
and Donna in danger!

581
00:33:49,024 --> 00:33:50,384
- It's all of you!
- Make the call!

582
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:56,026
Call!

583
00:34:04,028 --> 00:34:07,189
Admiral, I don't have
time to explain.

584
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,610
Just call in the trawler, now.

585
00:34:11,611 --> 00:34:13,030
Sir, I wouldn't be asking...

586
00:34:13,031 --> 00:34:14,072
Put it on speaker!

587
00:34:16,232 --> 00:34:17,442
It's in motion.

588
00:34:17,443 --> 00:34:18,902
We're not pulling back.
No chance.

589
00:34:18,903 --> 00:34:21,323
You've done a fine job.

590
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:23,654
- I'm sorry.
- Tonight all that hard work pays off.

591
00:34:23,655 --> 00:34:25,404
No, no, no!

592
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:27,945
Ryn, Ryn, Ryn! Wait!
You can't kill him!

593
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:29,445
- Move!
- No.

594
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:31,327
Why you help the bad man?

595
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,699
- Move!
- No, no, no.

596
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,289
You choose him.

597
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,999
No. Ryn.

598
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,501
You should choose me!

599
00:34:51,453 --> 00:34:54,203
Are you okay?

600
00:34:54,204 --> 00:34:56,454
They can't go back in the water.

601
00:34:56,455 --> 00:35:00,506
The Navy, it's out there.

602
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,299
My favorite part of the evening.

603
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:13,669
Are you bringing in the boats
to make Ben happy?

604
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,130
I'm bringing in the boats because
if I don't try something new,

605
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:19,091
I'm gonna become the old guard.

606
00:35:19,092 --> 00:35:20,883
And there's only one end
to the old guard.

607
00:35:22,923 --> 00:35:24,513
Well, I'm happy to hear it.

608
00:35:24,514 --> 00:35:25,963
Ben's got some good ideas.

609
00:35:25,964 --> 00:35:27,013
He does.

610
00:35:27,014 --> 00:35:28,384
I like that girl of his, too.

611
00:35:28,385 --> 00:35:30,515
Maddie.

612
00:35:30,516 --> 00:35:33,465
You do know that's
Dale Bishop's step-daughter?

613
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:35,136
I do.

614
00:35:35,137 --> 00:35:37,017
I also think she's smart,
she has spunk.

615
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:38,347
Spunk?

616
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:40,098
Okay, Mr. Cleaver.

617
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:43,600
In fact, she kind of reminds
me of a younger you.

618
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,100
You should invite her
to lunch again.

619
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:48,560
Why would I do that?

620
00:35:48,561 --> 00:35:50,471
Because we like
havin' Ben around,

621
00:35:50,472 --> 00:35:52,391
and Ben likes havin' her around.

622
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:57,433
<i>Bittersweet that song.</i>

623
00:35:57,434 --> 00:35:59,974
<i>When the darkness comes.</i>

624
00:35:59,975 --> 00:36:01,394
You See?

625
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:02,525
What?

626
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:05,566
What we learn in the water

627
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:08,526
about humans.

628
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:10,817
It is right.

629
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:12,478
No.

630
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:13,648
Yes!

631
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:16,069
I kill all.

632
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:20,230
On land, in water.

633
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:21,441
All.

634
00:36:21,442 --> 00:36:22,442
No!

635
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:24,151
No?

636
00:36:24,152 --> 00:36:26,652
Kill the bad ones, yes.

637
00:36:26,653 --> 00:36:27,483
Not the good.

638
00:36:27,484 --> 00:36:31,074
You choose human

639
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:32,655
over me.

640
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:36,195
I choose not to kill.

641
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:37,617
Go!

642
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:40,487
Now!

643
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:44,039
No.

644
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:54,951
<i>Bittersweet that song.</i>

645
00:36:54,952 --> 00:36:58,742
<i>When the darkness comes.</i>

646
00:36:58,743 --> 00:37:02,703
<i>Let a sweet thing go.</i>

647
00:37:02,704 --> 00:37:06,376
<i>When the darkness falls.</i>

648
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,959
Hey, yo, Chris!

649
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,881
Finish up, man, come on!
Let's go!

650
00:37:26,092 --> 00:37:29,462
Dude, that's her, man.

651
00:37:29,463 --> 00:37:30,843
That's the nurse! Look!

652
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:32,844
Look!

653
00:37:37,345 --> 00:37:38,386
Hey.

654
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:40,636
Hey, Hey! Stop!

655
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:42,927
Stop!

656
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:44,928
Come on, stop!

657
00:37:47,258 --> 00:37:49,179
Stop! Just wait up!
Just wait a minute!

658
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,600
Stop!

659
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,720
Stop right there! Wait! Wait!

660
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:56,101
Hey, stop!

661
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:12,494
Yo, Chris!
What's the deal with Calvin?

662
00:39:12,495 --> 00:39:15,536
I don't know.
It keeps goin' voicemail.

663
00:39:16,536 --> 00:39:18,086
He's at Janine's.

664
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:19,876
Just get over there and pull
his naked ass outta bed.

665
00:39:19,877 --> 00:39:21,708
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

666
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,919
Hey, it's Ben.
Leave me a message.

667
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,880
Yo, Ben.

668
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:34,831
What I told you earlier, I...

669
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:36,712
I was right, man.

670
00:39:36,713 --> 00:39:39,673
Man, I saw her!

671
00:39:39,674 --> 00:39:43,794
Just, um, get down here,
all right?

672
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:45,505
We're gonna go get her.

673
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:51,336
- What?
- Aw, Xander's goin' out there, too,

674
00:39:51,337 --> 00:39:52,887
hunting them.

675
00:39:52,888 --> 00:39:54,717
You think Ryn
went back in the water?

676
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:56,968
I don't know.
I have to get out there.

677
00:39:56,969 --> 00:39:58,679
Now without me, you're not.

678
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,839
She might come back.

679
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,550
One of us has to stay.

680
00:40:35,151 --> 00:40:36,852
Stop right there!

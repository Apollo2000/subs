1
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:12,368
Shine those lights!

2
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:14,446
- Let's go! Lock it down!
- I got it!

3
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:16,537
Watch out! Brace! It's a big one!

4
00:00:19,723 --> 00:00:21,226
Man! Oh, no!

5
00:00:21,294 --> 00:00:22,762
We're getting hammered out here!

6
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,428
Everything up!

7
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:26,629
Nets coming up!

8
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:28,682
- Bring it in!
- Steady!

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,115
Pull!

10
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:36,709
What the hell? -

11
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:38,712
Is there somethin' in there?

12
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:43,484
It's big! It... It's moving!

13
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:47,358
- <i> Chris!</i>
<i>-  No! It's right there!</i>

14
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:52,297
Chris! Let's take 'em out!

15
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,769
Shark?

16
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:57,282
That ain't no shark!

17
00:00:57,376 --> 00:01:00,088
Xander? You see it? It's over there!

18
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:04,264
Come on, come on, where are you at?

19
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:05,566
Show yourself.

20
00:01:08,072 --> 00:01:09,747
- Oh!
- Chris! Watch out!

21
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:11,171
Comin' around!

22
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,081
Goin' your way, Cal!
Calvin, head it off!

23
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,898
In the hold! Get it down there!

24
00:01:14,923 --> 00:01:17,690
Get it down there!

25
00:01:17,793 --> 00:01:18,925
What the hell is it?

26
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,334
- Oh, Xander!
- Chris.

27
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:23,224
- God, Xander!
- Chris!

28
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:25,752
Oh, God!

29
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,331
Come on!

30
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:31,908
He's lost a lot of blood, but...

31
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:34,235
Tamp it down.
Get in there good and tight.

32
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,617
This is the<i> North Star,</i>
vessel number 53422N.

33
00:01:39,643 --> 00:01:40,953
I have a crew member in need of

34
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:42,816
immediate medical evacuation. Over.

35
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:44,895
- <i>Nature of injury?</i>
- Bite to the abdomen,

36
00:01:44,923 --> 00:01:46,553
severe blood loss. Over.

37
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:47,991
<i>What bit him?</i>

38
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:49,947
I...

39
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,412
I got no idea.

40
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,569
What is it?

41
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,930
Secure.

42
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:01,575
Let's see what you
caught tonight, Captain.

43
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:04,156
What I caught is none of your business!

44
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:06,067
You're just here
for my injured crewman.

45
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:07,349
Of course.

46
00:03:07,374 --> 00:03:09,147
We'll be needing him as well.

47
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:12,484
Let's go!

48
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:17,934
Now then, Captain...

49
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:20,122
I'm entitled to that catch!

50
00:03:35,838 --> 00:03:37,325
Let's go!

51
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:22,314
Look what we found!

52
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,691
Margaritas!

53
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:25,816
Whoo!

54
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,298
Do you want a pretzel?!

55
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:36,792
It was more than 150 years ago

56
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,705
when a local fishing captain,

57
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:42,026
Charles H. Pownall,
fell in love with a mermaid

58
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,759
in these very waters,

59
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:46,691
enchanted by her beautiful Siren song.

60
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:48,250
I love you, fisherman.

61
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:49,418
I love you, mermaid.

62
00:04:49,453 --> 00:04:52,056
But one day, he went to the bay,

63
00:04:52,142 --> 00:04:54,175
and his mermaid was gone

64
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:56,111
back to her home in the sea,

65
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,643
never to return.

66
00:04:57,757 --> 00:05:00,889
And that is how,
thanks to Charles H. Pownall,

67
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:04,233
Bristol Cove became the
Mermaid Capital of the World.

68
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:14,176
Wow. Thank you.

69
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:18,916
That was my great-great-great-
grandfather depicted there,

70
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:20,301
so as you can see, our family goes back

71
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:22,141
a long ways in Bristol Cove.

72
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:25,069
Now please allow me to introduce
my beautiful wife Elaine

73
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:27,440
and our two wonderful sons,
Doug and Ben.

74
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:32,787
It seems, uh,

75
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:34,922
Ben may have been caught up
in the parade traffic,

76
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:37,335
but I can assure you
he is here in spirit.

77
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:40,231
So to all the good people
of Bristol Cove,

78
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:43,277
it is our great honor
to bestow this monument

79
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:46,253
to one of our town's founding fathers,

80
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:49,316
Charles H. Pownall.

81
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:57,363
Where the hell's Ben? Hmm?

82
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,864
Hola! How'd it go?

83
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:19,800
Rescued a Steller.

84
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:21,132
She's in pretty bad shape.

85
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:22,886
She's tagged. She's one of ours.

86
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:25,159
- Where'd you find her?
- Out by Scott's Point.

87
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,471
That's pretty far.

88
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:27,629
Yeah, about 30 miles

89
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,920
outside her usual range.

90
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:30,664
Probably looking for food.

91
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:34,649
Don't worry, girl.

92
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:36,050
We're gonna take good care of you.

93
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:40,152
Come on.

94
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:44,490
She's starving out there.

95
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,980
It's a good thing we went out today.

96
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:47,409
Not sure your dad
would agree with that.

97
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:50,201
Well, I'll add that to the list
of things we don't agree on.

98
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:51,903
Like you and me being together?

99
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:53,465
Hey. Look,

100
00:06:53,508 --> 00:06:56,727
if I did everything my dad told me,

101
00:06:56,878 --> 00:06:58,778
well, I'd be my brother.

102
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,510
You want to come over later?

103
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:02,602
I promised my dad I'd make him dinner.

104
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,777
Third time this week?

105
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:06,965
- Lucky guy.
- He needs me.

106
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,934
He'd be at the drive-thru
every night if I didn't cook.

107
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,892
Seriously, it's disturbing.

108
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:13,894
I could come by after for dessert.

109
00:07:14,154 --> 00:07:15,630
Spend the night?

110
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,090
If you want me to.

111
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:19,018
What do you think?

112
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:31,227
Hey, man. Thought you guys
were out past Bowers Ridge.

113
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,245
- You're back early.
- Yeah.

114
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,315
I need to talk to you about something.

115
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:36,952
All right.

116
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:38,378
Boys.

117
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:42,834
We said keep this between us.
Don't tell anybody.

118
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:44,601
Ben knows about this stuff, all right?

119
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:45,871
He can help us.

120
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,526
- He's one of us.
- He wasn't on the boat with us.

121
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,384
He doesn't fish with us no more.

122
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:57,630
We caught somethin' out there.

123
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,227
I mean, it's just somethin' we...

124
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,245
we ain't never seen before.

125
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:02,950
It attacked Chris.

126
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:04,117
He had to get airlifted out,

127
00:08:04,142 --> 00:08:06,398
big-ass military commando helicopter.

128
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:08,462
Navy SEALs, the whole deal.

129
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:11,499
CG says they have
no record of the evac,

130
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,177
like it never happened.

131
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:14,656
He's just gone.

132
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:16,625
What do you mean he's gone?

133
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,989
You really don't know
what attacked him?

134
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,849
A mermaid?

135
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:30,382
It didn't look like that, okay?

136
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:33,375
This... this was a predator.

137
00:08:35,984 --> 00:08:37,873
Okay, that was a good one.

138
00:08:38,964 --> 00:08:40,271
Yeah, very, very well done.

139
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:41,344
You almost had me there.

140
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:43,249
Dude, this is real.

141
00:08:43,464 --> 00:08:45,864
Hey, why else would they
take it from us, huh?

142
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:47,761
Wait.

143
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:51,076
Here. Look.

144
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,230
Okay.

145
00:08:57,821 --> 00:08:59,491
Xander, man, this could be anything.

146
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,233
I don't know what you call it,

147
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:08,237
but, trust me, it's not
what you think it is.

148
00:09:19,396 --> 00:09:21,229
<i> We had a report six weeks ago.</i>

149
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:23,317
Japanese fishermen claimed
they saw a sea creature

150
00:09:23,342 --> 00:09:24,586
off the Kuril Islands.

151
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,683
Then some carcasses
washed ashore in Alaska

152
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,750
with strange bite marks all over them.

153
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:30,691
Then five days ago, our research vessel

154
00:09:30,716 --> 00:09:32,163
picked up unidentified frequencies

155
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:33,674
coming from the Bering Strait.

156
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:35,452
We knew something was out there.

157
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:37,176
That's when I alerted your people.

158
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:39,692
And you're sure this is
what you think it is?

159
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:41,201
Well, Admiral...

160
00:09:41,229 --> 00:09:43,881
...why don't you judge for yourself?

161
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,223
Good morning, dear.

162
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,488
Your father is terribly angry with you.

163
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:17,090
Good morning to you, too.

164
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:19,301
Anthony?

165
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,071
I don't give a rat's ass
if your father's angry.

166
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:24,165
A lot of things make him angry,

167
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:26,229
like the fact that a woman
who can't walk

168
00:10:26,254 --> 00:10:28,676
insists on buying $600 shoes.

169
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:30,344
You know what he called
me the other day?

170
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:32,802
- What?
- Bitch on wheels.

171
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:36,887
- That's actually pretty funny.
- I thought so, too.

172
00:10:38,313 --> 00:10:40,313
Do you know why it was okay?

173
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:42,763
Because it was behind closed doors.

174
00:10:43,418 --> 00:10:44,720
Family rule...

175
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:46,082
You can say whatever the hell

176
00:10:46,107 --> 00:10:47,430
awful thing you want in private,

177
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:48,835
but in public...

178
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:53,293
This is a face that keeps
Mommy in nice shoes.

179
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:56,563
- I get it.
- No, I don't think you do.

180
00:10:57,425 --> 00:10:59,985
Because if you did, you'd show up.

181
00:11:00,407 --> 00:11:02,942
You would flash
that famous Pownall charm,

182
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:05,653
and you wouldn't leave
your father up on stage

183
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:07,340
with his pants around his ankles.

184
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:08,812
You know what, Mom?

185
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,682
If you guys want to put a
show on for the whole town,

186
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,564
that's your business, but I...

187
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:15,878
I don't want anything to do with it.

188
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:18,127
I got other things to worry about.

189
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,225
The spawning habits
of a bunch of plankton

190
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,424
are more important than family.

191
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,081
That's not what I'm saying.

192
00:11:24,598 --> 00:11:28,163
And I really don't want to
have this conversation again.

193
00:11:28,676 --> 00:11:31,610
Ben, I need this family
to keep working.

194
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:35,838
And I'm not willing
to suffer for nothing.

195
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:40,176
Okay, I hear you.

196
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:45,450
Doug tells me that you're hot
and heavy with Maddie Bishop.

197
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:47,853
Yeah, we're dating.

198
00:11:47,902 --> 00:11:50,286
You always had a thing
for the wild girls.

199
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:52,491
I gotta get some stuff done.

200
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:00,685
Always had a thing
for the wild girls, huh?

201
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,188
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:03,843
She didn't know you were in here.

203
00:12:04,227 --> 00:12:05,560
So if it weren't for your brother,

204
00:12:05,585 --> 00:12:08,083
she wouldn't even know
we were seeing each other?

205
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,929
Believe me, with my family,

206
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:12,937
nothing good ever comes from sharing.

207
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,080
You never know. Your mom and
I might actually hit it off.

208
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:18,124
Yeah, you might be right.

209
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,002
I mean, you're exactly

210
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:21,812
the kind of girl she'd
want me to be with.

211
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:23,823
Oh, yeah? What kind of girl is that?

212
00:12:24,898 --> 00:12:26,764
Beautiful.

213
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:29,555
Smart.

214
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,451
Funny.

215
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,185
Passionate.

216
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:40,978
And that smile

217
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,449
that could power a small city.

218
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,967
Ah, yes.

219
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:49,002
Ah, that famous Pownall charm.

220
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:04,307
Mm! No, dude, Aberdeen.

221
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:06,632
The best weed is in Aberdeen.

222
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:10,347
Seriously gourmet Kush.

223
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,537
Even my mom likes it.

224
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:16,262
I don't remember him being
such a burner in high school.

225
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:17,920
Yeah, that was more your crowd, right?

226
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:20,164
Oh, all right, golden boy.

227
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:30,089
Hey, I'll be back in a minute.

228
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:31,664
Okay.

229
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,409
I swear I'm gonna kill you
if you go out too far!

230
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,814
Hey.

231
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:49,394
You okay?

232
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:52,067
You're not seriously pissed
at me, are you?

233
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:53,779
I shouldn't have told you.

234
00:13:53,808 --> 00:13:54,973
- Should have known better.
- Think about

235
00:13:54,998 --> 00:13:56,520
what you're asking me to believe.

236
00:13:56,597 --> 00:13:58,694
I get it. You don't come out

237
00:13:58,719 --> 00:13:59,875
on the boat with us anymore.

238
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,378
You weren't there.

239
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:03,715
They took Chris.

240
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:06,083
They don't want people
to know about this.

241
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:08,595
Look, I don't know
what happened to Chris.

242
00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:11,064
Maybe he's in a military hospital.

243
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,869
We're gonna find him, Xan.

244
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:15,446
This isn't part of some huge cover-up,

245
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:17,404
and it's not because
of some mythical creature

246
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,821
that you guys think that you caught.

247
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,169
So you're telling me
you know everything

248
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,194
- there is to know about...
- No, of course not!

249
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:23,768
Then look me in the eye and you tell me

250
00:14:23,856 --> 00:14:25,715
that maybe... maybe there
is something down there

251
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,370
that we haven't seen before.

252
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:34,266
- Xan...
- Just...

253
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,288
Just do it.

254
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:38,701
Okay.

255
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:40,356
Sure.

256
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,314
95% of the oceans remain unexplored.

257
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,206
So it could happen?

258
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:50,943
Xander, man, I love you.

259
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:52,189
You know that.

260
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:54,448
But as a friend, I'm telling you,

261
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:56,962
you gotta stop talking like this.

262
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,778
What would it take?

263
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,074
Hmm?

264
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,435
For you to believe me?

265
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:06,410
I'd have to see one.

266
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:13,201
That's it.

267
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:16,572
That's exactly right.

268
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:19,722
We gotta catch another one.

269
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:23,142
Lucas, get back here!

270
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:46,741
Shark! Shark! Shark!

271
00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:48,766
Aah! Aah!

272
00:15:48,962 --> 00:15:50,261
Shark!

273
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:57,107
What are you thinking?

274
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:02,461
I can't even believe it.

275
00:16:03,568 --> 00:16:04,962
It's disgusting.

276
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:10,142
This damage definitely
wasn't inflicted by an orca.

277
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:12,461
The bite radius is way too small.

278
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,357
So what then?

279
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,704
Well, it's not another shark.

280
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:18,678
There are a million explanations.

281
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:21,006
- Okay?
- Caught in a boat prop,

282
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:23,318
sea lion bit the carcass?

283
00:16:25,544 --> 00:16:28,138
What if there's
a new predator out there?

284
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:30,468
One that we haven't seen before?

285
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:33,784
That can rip the head
clean off a mako shark?

286
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:37,748
Then I might have to cancel
my scuba trip next weekend.

287
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:04,096
Hey!

288
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:05,549
Are you okay?

289
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:10,087
Do you need help?

290
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:28,507
<i>Is she having trouble breathing?</i>

291
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:30,786
No, no, no, her breathing's fine.

292
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:32,618
Uh, a little heavy.

293
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:34,272
<i>Okay, I'll head out now.</i>

294
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:35,454
Are you sure?

295
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:36,885
I mean, I'm happy to drive her

296
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,383
down to the hospital in Port Angeles.

297
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:39,837
<i> It's okay, Ben.</i>
<i>I'll meet you at your place.</i>

298
00:17:39,862 --> 00:17:41,436
Okay. All right, I'll see you there.

299
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,261
Thanks, Dr. Abbott.

300
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:03,810
Sorry, that's all I had.

301
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,976
Littleneck clam.

302
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:22,365
From Malakh Bay.

303
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:28,701
You gonna say something?

304
00:18:35,263 --> 00:18:37,263
Now, I can help you.

305
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:40,369
If you need to get back somewhere.

306
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,286
You don't have to talk.

307
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,168
That must be the... the doctor.

308
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:31,513
Evening, Benjamin.

309
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:32,985
She's in here.

310
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:35,902
And kind of weird.

311
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:38,115
Okay.

312
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:46,224
She was right here.

313
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:53,392
Slippery one, huh?

314
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:21,499
- Give it to me?
- Uh, I think I'll keep it.

315
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,906
Come inside! Have a look!

316
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:44,966
The only real mermaid
artifacts in town!

317
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:47,087
Come inside! Have a look!

318
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:49,403
Maybe buy something while you're...

319
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:14,062
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

320
00:22:15,621 --> 00:22:17,034
Ms. Hawkins.

321
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:19,508
There was a girl just here.

322
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:20,809
You saw her?

323
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:22,882
Yeah, it looked like
you were talking to her.

324
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:26,372
I... I didn't see anyone.

325
00:23:58,339 --> 00:23:59,494
Hey, Dad.

326
00:23:59,552 --> 00:24:01,518
- Hey.
- Good day at the office?

327
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,091
You know Chris Mueller?

328
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,581
Crews on Sean McClure's boat.

329
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,812
Yeah, I know him.

330
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:09,264
Got a call from his parents.

331
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:11,461
Said he was medevaced
by a military chopper

332
00:24:11,486 --> 00:24:13,950
off Sean's boat in the strait,

333
00:24:14,268 --> 00:24:16,709
and now they can't find him.

334
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:19,270
Got me calling every base
from here to Alaska

335
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:21,195
looking for him.

336
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,450
There's nothing.

337
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:25,075
- So far.
- What do you think happened?

338
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:27,578
I don't know.

339
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:38,146
Creator, for this food and for You,

340
00:24:38,463 --> 00:24:40,148
we give thanks.

341
00:24:40,963 --> 00:24:42,489
And for Susan,

342
00:24:42,684 --> 00:24:44,791
may she find peace on her journey

343
00:24:44,848 --> 00:24:49,112
and within herself
and find her way back home.

344
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:57,224
It's been eight months
since we've heard from her.

345
00:24:57,294 --> 00:24:59,961
Might be time to start dropping
her from the blessings.

346
00:25:00,821 --> 00:25:03,332
I believe your mother is being guided.

347
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,205
Crash!

348
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,120
♪ <i>I am Ryn</i> ♪

349
00:25:58,149 --> 00:25:59,810
♪ <i>And I live in the sea</i> ♪

350
00:25:59,864 --> 00:26:03,684
I... am... Ryn.

351
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:08,364
Hello, Ryn.

352
00:26:17,787 --> 00:26:19,753
Hello, miss.

353
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:21,875
I see you there.

354
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,448
I... am... Ryn.

355
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,860
Not from around here, are you?

356
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:32,450
What you got?

357
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:34,535
Helicopter?

358
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:53,788
So, uh, you need a ride, huh?

359
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:56,203
I'm headin' down to Aberdeen.

360
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:58,184
Okay.

361
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:08,375
Not much of a talker, huh?

362
00:27:11,141 --> 00:27:12,633
That's okay.

363
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:15,009
It's nice just to have the company.

364
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,481
Sometimes I'll pick up a hitcher,

365
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:19,420
but, uh, they're mostly dudes.

366
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,931
Not a pretty little thing like you.

367
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:29,178
You like your little toy, huh?

368
00:28:06,008 --> 00:28:07,129
Hmm?

369
00:28:09,884 --> 00:28:11,451
You're like a little girl.

370
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,809
A pretty little girl
who don't know how to talk.

371
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:17,885
Now, I bet your mama told you,

372
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:19,027
"Don't get into cars

373
00:28:19,052 --> 00:28:20,274
with strangers."

374
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,080
But you didn't listen. Mm-mmm.

375
00:28:23,748 --> 00:28:26,098
You're a little rebel, huh? Yeah.

376
00:28:34,918 --> 00:28:36,651
Your skin's all dry.

377
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,526
You ought to put some cream on that,

378
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:40,760
make it nice and soft.

379
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:47,299
Isn't that what you're
lookin' for? Huh?

380
00:28:48,515 --> 00:28:50,315
A little adventure?

381
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,961
Little girl,
runnin' away from home, huh?

382
00:28:53,986 --> 00:28:55,958
Gettin' in a big man's car.

383
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:57,468
Yeah.

384
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:00,097
Yeah.

385
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:51,943
Okay, guys, we're gonna go this way.

386
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,881
Stay together, please.

387
00:29:53,946 --> 00:29:55,846
Watch your steps.

388
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,519
This is not a zoo.

389
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,402
This is a research and rescue center

390
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,294
for the many marine mammals
that inhabit our region.

391
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:08,461
We're able to offer veterinary care,

392
00:30:08,486 --> 00:30:11,490
perform surgical procedures,
and administer medication.

393
00:30:11,515 --> 00:30:13,374
What are all the TVs for?

394
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:15,199
Those are so we can
keep an eye on our animals

395
00:30:15,224 --> 00:30:17,416
and what they're doing,
both in an out of the water.

396
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,117
Yeah?

397
00:30:20,142 --> 00:30:21,607
When you were a kid,

398
00:30:21,632 --> 00:30:23,837
did you know you wanted to work here?

399
00:30:24,204 --> 00:30:26,119
Actually, it was a couple of years ago.

400
00:30:26,144 --> 00:30:29,079
I saw a video of a baby dolphin
that had washed ashore.

401
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:31,117
Instead of helping it,
the people on the beach

402
00:30:31,142 --> 00:30:33,208
passed it around taking
their picture with it.

403
00:30:33,257 --> 00:30:35,809
Even after it died,
they kept taking selfies.

404
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,691
That video made me sad,
and I wanted to do something,

405
00:30:38,716 --> 00:30:40,749
so I came here to volunteer.

406
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,915
Now it's my job.

407
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,083
You might be wondering
what our animals like to eat.

408
00:30:47,657 --> 00:30:48,982
Our fish shake...

409
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,909
A delicious blend of herring and cod,

410
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,429
with various nutrients
mixed in as well.

411
00:30:53,629 --> 00:30:55,015
Would anyone like a taste?

412
00:30:55,095 --> 00:30:56,360
No!

413
00:30:56,385 --> 00:30:57,586
No way.

414
00:30:57,611 --> 00:30:59,577
Okay, guys, we're gonna head outside.

415
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,774
Whoa!

416
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,383
- Whoa!
- Once our animals

417
00:31:22,408 --> 00:31:23,949
have received the medical
care they need,

418
00:31:23,974 --> 00:31:25,528
they come out here
to recover and prepare

419
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:27,040
for their journey back to the wild.

420
00:31:27,123 --> 00:31:28,891
This is Sitka and Hazy.

421
00:31:45,018 --> 00:31:46,985
What's going on?

422
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:48,453
I'm not sure.

423
00:31:54,449 --> 00:31:56,449
Everyone, come with me. Now.

424
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:00,046
It was her! She did it!

425
00:32:00,175 --> 00:32:01,942
Come on!

426
00:32:14,604 --> 00:32:16,537
We meet again.

427
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:18,098
It's okay.

428
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,294
I'm not gonna hurt you.

429
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:22,594
I can help you.

430
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,221
My name is Ben.

431
00:32:31,465 --> 00:32:33,198
Friend.

432
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:40,993
I am Ryn.

433
00:32:43,146 --> 00:32:44,443
Ryn.

434
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:47,001
Okay.

435
00:32:47,351 --> 00:32:48,713
Good.

436
00:32:49,754 --> 00:32:51,410
It's nice to meet you.

437
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:53,368
Where are you from?

438
00:32:53,393 --> 00:32:54,408
Hey.

439
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:57,167
You're sick.

440
00:32:57,807 --> 00:33:00,177
Now, can I see?

441
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,602
We have medication here.

442
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:09,891
We can help you.

443
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:27,256
The night we met, you sang a song.

444
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,215
I can't get it out of my head.

445
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,576
Everywhere I go...

446
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,298
I hear it.

447
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:38,249
Oh, hey.

448
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,479
Um, everything's
back to normal out there.

449
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,712
Not sure what that was all about.

450
00:33:43,381 --> 00:33:44,732
This is Ryn.

451
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:47,157
I don't think she speaks English.

452
00:33:48,464 --> 00:33:49,879
Is she okay?

453
00:33:50,135 --> 00:33:51,560
I'm not sure.

454
00:33:51,848 --> 00:33:53,344
I was gonna call Doc Abbott.

455
00:33:53,382 --> 00:33:55,077
Yeah. Yeah, you should.

456
00:33:58,984 --> 00:34:00,437
You okay?

457
00:34:00,884 --> 00:34:02,904
Yeah, I guess.

458
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:04,867
She's just...

459
00:34:04,903 --> 00:34:06,836
She's a little strange.

460
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:08,388
You want me to stay?

461
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,119
No. You got your class.

462
00:34:10,144 --> 00:34:11,205
It's okay.

463
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,816
No, I don't want you to miss it.

464
00:34:12,914 --> 00:34:14,219
Okay. It's getting dark.

465
00:34:14,244 --> 00:34:16,006
I'm gonna lock down the pens.

466
00:34:17,773 --> 00:34:19,901
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

467
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,117
I'm gonna call a doctor for you.

468
00:34:27,488 --> 00:34:28,878
Okay?

469
00:34:41,363 --> 00:34:43,296
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
we've got some of that.

470
00:34:43,321 --> 00:34:45,498
Bye. Thanks, Doc.
I'll see you in a bit.

471
00:37:38,284 --> 00:37:41,021
Whoa, easy there. Easy.

472
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:42,419
What happened?

473
00:37:42,444 --> 00:37:43,576
Apparently one of the sea lions

474
00:37:43,601 --> 00:37:45,534
didn't like the herring
you served him for dinner.

475
00:37:45,558 --> 00:37:47,092
You should stay lying down, okay?

476
00:37:47,117 --> 00:37:48,918
Where is she?

477
00:37:49,387 --> 00:37:51,851
Ah, yes, your mystery date.

478
00:37:52,284 --> 00:37:55,252
Ben, I've know you and
your family a long time.

479
00:37:55,627 --> 00:37:57,951
Is there something
you're not telling me?

480
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:14,592
Ms. Hawkins!

481
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:15,883
Hello!

482
00:38:16,954 --> 00:38:17,954
Ms. Hawkins.

483
00:38:19,302 --> 00:38:21,298
That girl yesterday,

484
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:23,418
I know you saw her.

485
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:25,300
You said you didn't,
but I know you did.

486
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:27,617
You know something about her.

487
00:38:28,602 --> 00:38:30,071
Come in.

488
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:40,820
What is it you think I know?

489
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:43,830
That she's one of them.

490
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,744
I saw it, tonight.

491
00:38:46,913 --> 00:38:48,846
What did you see?

492
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,525
She changed in the water.

493
00:38:57,194 --> 00:38:59,128
Just like this.

494
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,833
When we were kids, we'd come in here,

495
00:39:01,866 --> 00:39:04,155
and you'd tell us stories
about the mermaids.

496
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,862
We were always told that they were just

497
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:07,341
tall tales, not to believe you.

498
00:39:07,366 --> 00:39:09,095
But they weren't made up, were they?

499
00:39:09,935 --> 00:39:11,501
They were true.

500
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,725
I don't get it.

501
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:17,103
You want people to know the truth.

502
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,759
Well, it's here! It's happening!

503
00:39:19,784 --> 00:39:21,684
What are you so afraid of
all of a sudden?

504
00:39:22,406 --> 00:39:24,473
She do that to you?

505
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:30,554
In their natural state in the water,

506
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:32,676
they see you as prey.

507
00:39:33,652 --> 00:39:35,559
Their instinct is to kill.

508
00:39:36,413 --> 00:39:38,879
Humans never understood that.

509
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:41,385
It caused a lot of misery.

510
00:39:42,145 --> 00:39:43,711
What do you mean?

511
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,754
Your family's history in this town

512
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:47,753
is bloodier than you know.

513
00:39:47,947 --> 00:39:51,709
Your ancestor lost his mind, obsessed.

514
00:39:52,197 --> 00:39:53,469
He and his shipmates slaughtered

515
00:39:53,494 --> 00:39:56,529
those beautiful creatures
in cold blood.

516
00:39:57,276 --> 00:39:59,043
Genocide.

517
00:40:00,206 --> 00:40:02,140
That's your legacy.

518
00:40:03,388 --> 00:40:06,389
Why don't you ask
your family about that?

519
00:40:58,763 --> 00:41:00,096
What's wrong, Mads?

520
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,299
Just been trying to get a hold of Ben.

521
00:41:02,324 --> 00:41:03,572
He's not calling me back.

522
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:05,528
Well, I'm sure he's just busy.

523
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:08,502
See? There you go.

524
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:11,070
Hello?

525
00:41:12,831 --> 00:41:14,764
Yeah, he's here.

526
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,448
For you, it's Clarence.

527
00:41:18,925 --> 00:41:20,992
Hey, Clarence, what's up?

528
00:41:27,386 --> 00:41:28,822
Okay.

529
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,583
All right.

530
00:41:30,795 --> 00:41:32,561
I'll be there.

531
00:41:34,861 --> 00:41:36,794
What's going on?

532
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:38,426
They found a body.

533
00:41:38,492 --> 00:41:41,161
Some guy attacked in his car.

534
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:49,052
Don't worry. He's gonna call you.

535
00:42:06,832 --> 00:42:08,198
Hey.

536
00:42:13,426 --> 00:42:14,629
What are you doing here?

537
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:16,752
I'm coming with you.

538
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,420
- Dad?
- Yeah?

539
00:42:26,371 --> 00:42:28,004
We got room for one more?

540
00:42:54,254 --> 00:42:56,154
It's just like old times.

541
00:42:57,286 --> 00:42:58,742
Yeah.

542
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,692
Maybe... Maybe we catch one,

543
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,260
military comes looking for us,

544
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:08,790
leads us to Chris.

545
00:43:39,304 --> 00:43:41,950
Hey, we got somethin'.

546
00:43:43,798 --> 00:43:45,390
Wow, it's big.

547
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:46,670
It's moving fast.

548
00:43:46,695 --> 00:43:48,025
Port side.

549
00:44:00,816 --> 00:44:02,356
Show yourself.

550
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,637
I know you're out there.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:10,00

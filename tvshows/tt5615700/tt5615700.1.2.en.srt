1
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:12,806
- Stop! Don't!
- Aah!

2
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:14,266
What the hell?!

3
00:00:14,494 --> 00:00:16,059
You don't want to do that.
That could kill it.

4
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:17,396
Thought you said you came
out here to help us.

5
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:20,128
I had a clean shot till you stepped in.

6
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:22,357
Almost like you don't
want us catching it.

7
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:25,740
Look, if this thing really is
what you think it is,

8
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,909
we need to protect it, not kill it.

9
00:00:27,943 --> 00:00:29,611
Ugh!

10
00:00:30,037 --> 00:00:31,913
We want what belongs to us,

11
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:33,732
and we want to get Chris back.

12
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:35,105
If you don't want the same thing,

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,353
I don't know what the hell
you're doing on the boat.

14
00:00:36,377 --> 00:00:38,066
Shh, shh!

15
00:00:39,094 --> 00:00:40,494
Hear that?

16
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:47,578
It's like, I don't know, it's injured?

17
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:53,113
Maybe I hit it.

18
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:57,238
It's underneath.

19
00:00:57,473 --> 00:00:59,941
- It's underneath the boat!
- We gotta get it.

20
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:03,265
Ben!

21
00:01:04,393 --> 00:01:05,626
- Ben!
- Ben!

22
00:01:13,162 --> 00:01:14,622
- Ben!
- Ben!

23
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,099
Come on!

24
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:40,606
Ben!

25
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:43,452
- What the...
- What the hell is that?

26
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:46,797
Ben! Ben, come on!

27
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:48,696
Get over here.

28
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,106
It might be a Doppler current profiler.

29
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:38,960
Oceanographers uses them
to study current patterns.

30
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,280
When we had the creature in the hold,

31
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:42,406
it... it made a sound,

32
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:44,598
not too different
from the sound this thing makes.

33
00:02:44,972 --> 00:02:46,425
Right.

34
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:48,962
Well, there's a lot of scientific

35
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:50,869
monitoring devices floating out there.

36
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,266
Could be a lot of things.

37
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,897
Well, just think about it.

38
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,683
We were out here, what,
like, a few days ago?

39
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:56,803
And this thing wasn't here.

40
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:57,834
And then we catch that creature,

41
00:02:57,858 --> 00:02:59,037
and, all of a sudden, it just appears?

42
00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:01,028
Somebody put it here.
It's gotta be connected.

43
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:02,764
Yeah, you could be right.

44
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,384
You know, that was, um...

45
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:11,440
That was a pretty sick thing
you did back there,

46
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:12,907
diving in like that.

47
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,577
Yeah. Well, it seemed
like a good idea at the time.

48
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:18,746
Look, I'm sorry,

49
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,678
okay, if I pissed you off earlier.

50
00:03:20,749 --> 00:03:22,950
I just feel differently
about it than you guys.

51
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:25,520
It doesn't mean that I
don't want to find Chris.

52
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:28,260
I appreciate it.

53
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:30,595
For real.

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,247
Couldn't tell,

55
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:34,378
'cause you were being
such a dick about it.

56
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:40,208
What is it?

57
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:45,342
I don't know. This thing
looks like a camera.

58
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:48,009
There's probably some kind
of tracking device on it, too.

59
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:49,222
We should try to disable it.

60
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:51,119
I say we just power it up
and set it off.

61
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,300
Let the military come.
They'll lead us to Chris,

62
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:54,649
and maybe they got the mermaid, too.

63
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:56,042
I wouldn't.

64
00:03:57,046 --> 00:03:59,297
You saw what happened
the last time they came.

65
00:03:59,497 --> 00:04:01,018
We could all end up like Chris.

66
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:03,712
We just need to take our time

67
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:07,021
and try to figure out
what this thing really is.

68
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,450
Okay.

69
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:44,660
Take your sister inside the house!

70
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:08,915
Hey! What the hell are you doin'?

71
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:11,192
Takin' my clothes?

72
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:13,152
I am sick of you little junkies
comin' around here

73
00:05:13,177 --> 00:05:14,765
messin' with my stuff.

74
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,311
Don't you threaten me.

75
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,141
<i>Hey, it's Ben. Leave me a message.</i>

76
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:17,059
Hey, it's me.

77
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,820
I'm getting worried about you.

78
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:22,036
Give me a call.
Let me know you're okay.

79
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:43,751
Hello?

80
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:00,033
You get a hold of CSI?

81
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:02,827
Comin' from Port Angeles.
Should be here soon.

82
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:07,205
What do you got, Clarence?

83
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,964
That is Donnie Price.

84
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:10,883
He's got some priors.

85
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:13,900
Aggravated assault,
drunk and disorderly.

86
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:15,384
Pants are ridin' a little low.

87
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:17,291
Possible sexual assault?

88
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:19,428
Looks like he got what he deserved.

89
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:22,470
Or there was a third person
in the car with them.

90
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:24,618
Somebody came up on them.

91
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:30,944
Whoever did this was of
substantial size and strength.

92
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,744
Start lookin' around.

93
00:08:16,398 --> 00:08:18,199
How much for this?

94
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:21,580
I'm, uh, very sorry. Shop's closed.

95
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:23,117
Come back another day, huh?

96
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,626
Thank you.

97
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,421
You came back.

98
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:48,436
Why are you here?

99
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:25,572
I...

100
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,780
See?

101
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:43,984
Look?

102
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:47,024
You look.

103
00:09:53,035 --> 00:09:54,201
Ryn.

104
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:56,377
Ryn.

105
00:09:56,592 --> 00:09:58,078
That's you.

106
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:09,156
Look.

107
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,066
There's another one?

108
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,850
30 ccs of spinal fluid,

109
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,086
and take tissue core samples
from the upper thoracic region.

110
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:27,975
How many?

111
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:30,683
Take six for now.

112
00:10:30,718 --> 00:10:31,918
I'll order more as needed.

113
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,213
How are the other tests going?

114
00:10:33,238 --> 00:10:34,997
- Very well.
- We're ready for extraction?

115
00:11:15,497 --> 00:11:16,797
I got your text.

116
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,897
Where the hell have you been?

117
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:23,017
What's wrong?

118
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,184
Whoa!

119
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:32,253
What happened? Are you okay?

120
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,260
It's not what you're thinking.

121
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,651
How do you know what I'm thinking?

122
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:40,772
'Cause it literally couldn't be
anything that you're thinking.

123
00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:43,586
I gotta show you something.

124
00:11:48,644 --> 00:11:50,538
- Yo, man.
- Yo.

125
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,083
What is that?

126
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:56,980
We found it out in the water.

127
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:58,262
It was making this...

128
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:00,195
I don't know, this weird-ass sound.

129
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:02,580
Ben said we should take our time,

130
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:03,960
try to figure out who's runnin' it,

131
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:05,159
what they're up to.

132
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:06,586
Wait, Ben knows about this?

133
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:07,856
Yeah, he came out with us.

134
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,591
And now he's telling us what to do?

135
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:11,487
Don't trust him, man.

136
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:13,113
The guy crewed up with us
for a few seasons,

137
00:12:13,138 --> 00:12:14,616
but he was always
just slumming it until college.

138
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,018
- You know that, right?
- Yeah, but, I mean,

139
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,409
you guys were never close, all right?

140
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:18,816
I been through a lot with him.

141
00:12:18,995 --> 00:12:21,211
I hear you, but look at his family.

142
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:23,461
He's not one of us, man.

143
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:25,140
Never has been.

144
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:38,200
It has to be here.

145
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:44,035
All I see are sea lions.

146
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:45,232
It'll be here.

147
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,935
There!

148
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:48,335
Look.

149
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:58,977
I went in to save her.

150
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,951
And then she turned into that

151
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:02,777
and attacked me.

152
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,134
- Maddie?
- Play it again.

153
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,489
Okay.

154
00:13:07,642 --> 00:13:09,479
Here's a different camera.

155
00:13:15,904 --> 00:13:17,872
Oh, man.

156
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:19,920
This is real.

157
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:22,810
Maddie, this is really happening.

158
00:13:23,991 --> 00:13:25,718
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

159
00:13:25,794 --> 00:13:27,962
It's kinda hard to believe someone

160
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:29,168
when they tell you they just saw...

161
00:13:29,193 --> 00:13:30,761
Mermaid.

162
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:32,559
Yeah.

163
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:53,942
Okay, I got...

164
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:55,542
Aah!

165
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:59,286
It's me.

166
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:01,513
Helen.

167
00:14:01,768 --> 00:14:03,101
Helen.

168
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:08,140
Helen.

169
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:13,767
Hello, Helen.

170
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:17,046
You learn quickly.

171
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:21,844
<i>Oh, thank you, Lord...</i>

172
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:23,818
That's my neighbor's book.

173
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:28,547
Two girls.

174
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:36,415
"Sister."

175
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:40,066
Sisters.

176
00:14:43,443 --> 00:14:45,978
Is that who you're looking for?

177
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,454
For your sister?

178
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,157
Sister.

179
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,194
I'll be damned.

180
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,106
I have these for you.

181
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:02,775
Put them on.

182
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:20,799
Oh. Lovely.

183
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,911
You need food.

184
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:32,311
Humans love to eat.

185
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:35,575
We do most of our hunting

186
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,234
in a supermarket.

187
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:49,127
Oh, no. No. Uh-uh!

188
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:53,408
Please, give.

189
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:55,514
Give.

190
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:56,812
Thank you.

191
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:58,938
I think I know what you need.

192
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:01,153
You stay here.

193
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,462
I'll go get you food.

194
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,498
Then we'll look for your sister.

195
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,199
Okay?

196
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:28,454
<i>There's something else, Maddie.</i>

197
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:30,080
When I went out with Xander,

198
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:32,540
we found this device in the water.

199
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:35,970
Some kind of military tracking device.

200
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,723
I think they're looking for her.

201
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,463
The military? This is crazy.

202
00:16:41,373 --> 00:16:43,370
Does anyone else know about her?

203
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:46,652
Uh, yeah, just the guys on the boat

204
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:48,478
and Miss Hawkins.

205
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:49,970
Helen Hawkins?

206
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:52,158
You told her? Why would you do that?

207
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:54,346
She was talking
to that girl on the street.

208
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:56,857
I... It looked like she knew
something about her,

209
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:57,949
so I went to talk to her.

210
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:59,145
Well, what did she say?

211
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,036
She started talking
about my family, Maddie.

212
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,663
She was saying I should
ask my dad about it.

213
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,459
Your dad? Well...

214
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,445
Did you talk to him?

215
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:10,050
Not yet.

216
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,964
It's done.

217
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,190
All the video's downloaded.

218
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:17,684
This thing, it attacked you,

219
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,330
it... it got Chris.

220
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:20,957
It's dangerous.

221
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:24,224
If we're gonna go after
it, try to track it down,

222
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:26,482
we need to be careful.

223
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,910
You're right.

224
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:36,221
Dude, you know what? You were right.

225
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,778
It makes sense.

226
00:17:37,838 --> 00:17:39,405
We reconnect the tracking equipment,

227
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,196
we power that thing up, and
when the military comes.

228
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:43,012
Boom! We ambush them.

229
00:17:43,037 --> 00:17:44,133
You need to calm down.

230
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:45,918
We are not gonna ambush the military.

231
00:17:46,006 --> 00:17:47,406
- Calm down?
- Yeah.

232
00:17:47,494 --> 00:17:49,094
You sound just like Ben.

233
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:51,163
Okay, look, you don't
know him like I do, all right?

234
00:17:51,188 --> 00:17:53,256
Look, I told you,
stop listening to him!

235
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:54,970
He's got no clue what we're
dealing with right now.

236
00:17:54,994 --> 00:17:56,410
Pretty sure he's one of the only people

237
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:57,522
that actually does have a clue

238
00:17:57,547 --> 00:17:58,548
what we're dealing with right now,

239
00:17:58,572 --> 00:18:01,149
so maybe you should just give
him a little faith, all right?

240
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,237
That's a good run of sockeye.

241
00:18:13,337 --> 00:18:15,171
Enjoy it while it lasts.

242
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,538
Yeah, I worry about that, too,

243
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,397
but I also worry about people.

244
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,139
And right now, I'm giving good
jobs to folks who need them.

245
00:18:21,312 --> 00:18:22,979
I wanted to ask you something.

246
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:25,595
I remember that you and Grandpa

247
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,121
used to talk about Charles Pownall,

248
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:30,640
about what really happened back then.

249
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:34,004
You really come here to ask me that?

250
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:35,471
Yeah.

251
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:39,280
Why the sudden interest
in the family history?

252
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:43,330
I ran into Helen Hawkins.

253
00:18:43,361 --> 00:18:44,836
Oh, come on.

254
00:18:45,043 --> 00:18:46,578
Dad?

255
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:50,387
Maybe I'd show up to more family events

256
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:52,090
like the statue unveiling

257
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:55,225
if you told me the real
story about our family.

258
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:58,274
All right.

259
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:01,555
Look...

260
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,854
Charles might not have been exactly
who we make him out to be.

261
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:07,976
I can't say for sure,

262
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:09,858
but there might have been
some mental illness,

263
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:12,106
maybe even schizophrenia.

264
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:14,896
Long months at sea,
a constant stream of booze,

265
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:18,211
and, uh, well, he was seeing things.

266
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,817
Mermaids?

267
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:23,729
You know this.
You did the play in school.

268
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:25,749
That's how the town got its folklore.

269
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:27,446
Now, as for Helen and her stories,

270
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:29,739
well, we all know she's
got a vivid imagination.

271
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:33,802
That's it?

272
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,444
That's it.

273
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:39,609
Why?

274
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:44,347
Dad, I gotta go.

275
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:51,332
I'll take a pound of mussels.

276
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,714
Oh, and a pound of clams.

277
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,100
Yeah, make sure you get the big ones.

278
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,078
Shrimp... give me two dozen shrimp

279
00:19:58,103 --> 00:19:59,670
and some scallops.

280
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:02,077
Yeah, a little bit
of that sockeye, crab.

281
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,456
Actually, make that two.

282
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:05,818
I'll take two, two crabs. Thanks, yeah.

283
00:20:05,843 --> 00:20:08,099
No, that's a baby. I'm gonna
have to get something else.

284
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,215
That nice, big salmon over there?

285
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:12,023
Thank you.

286
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:14,130
Anything else?

287
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:17,033
Got any sardines?

288
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:25,416
Calvin?

289
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:26,823
Hey, Calvin!

290
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:28,579
Yeah?

291
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:30,320
Did you move it?

292
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:31,769
What, the thing? No, I didn't touch it.

293
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:33,461
Well, it's gone.

294
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,384
You see?

295
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:40,023
See what?

296
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,468
The military came and took the mermaid,

297
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,040
took Chris,

298
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,123
and now they came in here
and took the thing.

299
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:54,550
We shouldn't even be
talking in here right now.

300
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,953
Where am I?

301
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:39,449
What's happening?

302
00:21:54,598 --> 00:21:56,131
They've been out here all this time,

303
00:21:56,156 --> 00:21:57,935
so why are they showing up now?

304
00:21:58,619 --> 00:21:59,766
I was thinking the same thing

305
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,115
when I was at my dad's.

306
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,212
What do you mean?

307
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,278
Something brought her closer
to the surface, all right?

308
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,790
Maybe it's the change
in the oceans, you know?

309
00:22:06,815 --> 00:22:08,632
Maybe she's looking
for a new food source.

310
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:10,813
- Same as our sea lions.
- Right.

311
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:12,328
Thanks to my family.

312
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:27,890
Helen Hawkins seems to know
a lot about this stuff.

313
00:22:28,398 --> 00:22:30,566
I'm hoping she'll have some answers.

314
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:32,115
Well, there she is.

315
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,507
The town nut job.

316
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:36,864
<i>Yeah.</i>

317
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:40,129
Maybe don't say that in front of her.

318
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:49,043
Oh, uh, shop's closed.

319
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,296
Sorry to bother you,

320
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:52,654
but I just had a few more
questions I wanted to ask you.

321
00:22:53,444 --> 00:22:55,318
You told her?

322
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:57,794
Yeah. We can trust her.

323
00:22:58,195 --> 00:23:00,274
It's not about trust.

324
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,899
No one else can know.

325
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,888
These creatures were massacred once.

326
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,651
It could happen again.

327
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:10,274
Look, we're not
gonna tell anyone, okay?

328
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:11,333
We want to protect them, too.

329
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:16,176
I, uh, told you everything I know.

330
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:21,344
She's gone,

331
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:23,871
probably a hundred miles
out in the ocean by now.

332
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,024
Is everything okay?

333
00:23:34,598 --> 00:23:36,850
Plumbing issues. It's an old building.

334
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:39,036
I have things to do,

335
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:40,511
so if you don't mind...

336
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:42,637
This is just gonna take a second.

337
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:47,303
We found this in the water.

338
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:49,499
I was wondering if you could
tell me what this sound is.

339
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:01,177
Turn it off.

340
00:24:13,924 --> 00:24:15,272
Aah!

341
00:24:20,196 --> 00:24:22,331
Turn it off now!

342
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:35,999
Aah!

343
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:42,498
Sister!

344
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,832
Close it, close it!

345
00:25:01,091 --> 00:25:02,759
Sister!

346
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,584
Sister!

347
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:06,015
That sound is your sister?

348
00:25:06,523 --> 00:25:08,157
She's not in there.

349
00:25:08,372 --> 00:25:10,592
It's... It's just a recording.

350
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:13,676
Only sound.

351
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,469
Better?

352
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:24,634
There were two of them out there.

353
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:26,455
Her sister's the one who got caught.

354
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,320
What?

355
00:25:33,317 --> 00:25:35,026
Aah!

356
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:41,237
Aah!

357
00:25:49,612 --> 00:25:50,946
Whoa.

358
00:25:56,106 --> 00:25:57,419
Are you okay?

359
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:07,522
Look, I get it.

360
00:26:08,675 --> 00:26:11,954
You came back
to find your sister, right?

361
00:26:14,431 --> 00:26:16,032
We can help you.

362
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:21,924
Okay.

363
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:22,943
Yes.

364
00:26:22,993 --> 00:26:24,360
She understands.

365
00:26:24,594 --> 00:26:26,247
They're highly intelligent.

366
00:26:26,444 --> 00:26:28,578
More so than humans.

367
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,411
Okay.

368
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,169
Ben, her sister could be anywhere.

369
00:26:38,242 --> 00:26:39,996
How would we find her?

370
00:26:40,811 --> 00:26:42,144
I don't know.

371
00:26:42,957 --> 00:26:44,630
We should probably start with Xander.

372
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,498
I want to hear again
what happened out there.

373
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,299
Maybe there's something I missed.

374
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:51,948
Look.

375
00:26:55,565 --> 00:26:57,127
Wait, wait.

376
00:26:57,221 --> 00:26:58,420
Hey! She...

377
00:26:58,448 --> 00:27:00,482
She can't just go out into the world.

378
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:03,653
Do we have a choice?

379
00:27:04,053 --> 00:27:06,521
Bring her back later.

380
00:27:06,697 --> 00:27:08,364
She's safe with me.

381
00:27:23,627 --> 00:27:25,453
I'm sorry.

382
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:27,817
I'm sorry we did that to you.

383
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:08,598
So how long did you know him?

384
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:11,177
He moved in about eight months ago.

385
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:13,230
- Mm-hmm.
- Liked to party,

386
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,809
had a lot of girlfriends.

387
00:28:15,103 --> 00:28:16,269
Drugs.

388
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:17,739
Uh, not a bad guy,

389
00:28:17,954 --> 00:28:19,621
but not good, either.

390
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,757
Well, he's not either anymore.

391
00:28:22,006 --> 00:28:23,801
Listen, if you think of anything else,

392
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:26,043
- give me a call, all right?
- Sheriff?

393
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,297
Oh, boy.

394
00:28:27,351 --> 00:28:28,380
Phillip.

395
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,560
Vicki.

396
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:32,009
- I have a crime to report.
- Yeah?

397
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:34,955
This little homeless girl's been
stealing clothing off my line.

398
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:36,729
She got my daughter's
Huskies sweatshirt,

399
00:28:36,754 --> 00:28:38,455
this morning, a T-shirt.

400
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:40,338
I went out to confront her,

401
00:28:40,363 --> 00:28:42,531
and she threw a damn metal pole at me.

402
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:45,036
Almost took my head off.

403
00:28:45,483 --> 00:28:46,984
Is that right?

404
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:50,348
What'd she look like?

405
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:07,861
Xander? Hey, yeah, I've been
trying to get a hold of you.

406
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:09,453
Where are you?

407
00:29:11,105 --> 00:29:12,466
He's at The Anchor.

408
00:29:37,925 --> 00:29:39,147
- No.
- No.

409
00:29:39,172 --> 00:29:40,779
No, no, no, no, no, no.

410
00:29:40,804 --> 00:29:41,914
Wait, wait.

411
00:29:41,939 --> 00:29:43,353
Too many people.

412
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,628
It's not safe. Not safe.

413
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:48,823
You stay here.

414
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:50,868
I'll stay with her.

415
00:29:51,716 --> 00:29:53,179
We'll stay together.

416
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:56,073
Then we'll... Then... Then
we'll look for your sister.

417
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:58,891
Are you sure?

418
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,017
Yeah.

419
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:02,505
Do you wanna...

420
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,359
You wanna wait outside the car?

421
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:06,797
I'll be okay.

422
00:30:09,173 --> 00:30:11,775
All right. Be careful.

423
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:28,918
Hi.

424
00:30:43,762 --> 00:30:45,262
Decoration.

425
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:48,075
You like them?

426
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:10,019
Raven feather.

427
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:11,822
Bird.

428
00:31:14,238 --> 00:31:16,309
My dad is Haida.

429
00:31:17,462 --> 00:31:20,631
They talk about how the raven
was the maker of things.

430
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:26,207
They say he put the sun
and moon in the sky,

431
00:31:27,211 --> 00:31:30,081
brought fresh water
and fire to the land.

432
00:31:32,317 --> 00:31:36,244
They say he found the first
people inside a giant clamshell.

433
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,032
Bird.

434
00:31:42,454 --> 00:31:44,388
It's just a story.

435
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:48,465
Made up.

436
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,215
Some things are real,

437
00:31:52,303 --> 00:31:54,601
others are just stories.

438
00:31:58,537 --> 00:32:00,950
This, real.

439
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:05,482
This.

440
00:32:06,484 --> 00:32:07,684
Real.

441
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,282
Real.

442
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:21,172
Yes.

443
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:23,894
You're real.

444
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,791
Okay, so Chris gets attacked,

445
00:32:40,816 --> 00:32:43,017
and your dad calls in the evac?

446
00:32:43,415 --> 00:32:44,617
Yeah.

447
00:32:44,642 --> 00:32:46,516
The military must have been listening,

448
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,749
or CG tipped them off. I don't know.

449
00:32:48,774 --> 00:32:50,808
Did it look like there was
someone in charge?

450
00:32:50,915 --> 00:32:52,148
Yeah.

451
00:32:52,244 --> 00:32:54,712
Okay, so what... what did he look like?

452
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,325
Uh... he was a black dude.

453
00:32:57,381 --> 00:32:59,115
Okay, anything else about him?

454
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,441
I don't know why this is
any of your damn business.

455
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:05,909
It's like they were
waitin' for us all along.

456
00:33:06,475 --> 00:33:09,114
Like, if it's the military, man,

457
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,052
then they are watching us.

458
00:33:11,077 --> 00:33:12,177
They know stuff about us.

459
00:33:12,202 --> 00:33:13,235
Xander.

460
00:33:13,511 --> 00:33:14,914
They flew off with Chris,

461
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:16,342
they broke into our place

462
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,228
and took that device.

463
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,179
They are after us, man.

464
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:22,174
Probably bugged our apartment, too.

465
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:24,666
- We should do a sweep.
- Yeah. Yes, definitely.

466
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,360
Maybe... maybe... Maybe we, um...

467
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:32,319
Maybe we post that footage
from the deck, yeah?

468
00:33:32,384 --> 00:33:34,527
Blast it online, just
blow this whole thing up.

469
00:33:34,552 --> 00:33:36,086
It wasn't the military.

470
00:33:38,556 --> 00:33:40,099
What do you mean?

471
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:41,774
It was me.

472
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:43,360
I took it.

473
00:33:44,742 --> 00:33:46,143
You?

474
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,101
- What the hell?
- Look, Xander,

475
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:53,613
I thought I could figure out
what it was, you know.

476
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:55,786
- I thought it would help Chris.
- That's bullshit!

477
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:58,107
We should be helping each other,
not fighting each...

478
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:00,360
Ooh!

479
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,425
Come on!

480
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,638
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Get off him!

481
00:34:06,751 --> 00:34:08,260
Calvin, seriously.

482
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:10,760
It's okay, everybody.

483
00:34:12,704 --> 00:34:14,363
I was trying to help.

484
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,588
Look, if you want it,

485
00:34:18,761 --> 00:34:20,491
I'll go get it right now.

486
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,382
Okay.

487
00:34:31,683 --> 00:34:32,894
We need to give it back.

488
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:34,154
Why? What's happening?

489
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,513
We don't need it anymore.

490
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,180
Ryn, we need to give it back, okay?

491
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:39,810
No, no, no, no.

492
00:34:39,846 --> 00:34:41,348
We need to give this back.

493
00:34:41,392 --> 00:34:42,960
- Sister!
- This is not your sister.

494
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:44,318
- Yes!
- Sister is not in here.

495
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:47,191
We're gonna help you. Friends.

496
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:48,999
Look, this is Xander.

497
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,468
He can help find your sister,

498
00:34:50,493 --> 00:34:52,628
but we need to give this back to him.

499
00:34:53,117 --> 00:34:55,452
Friend, okay?

500
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,859
Here, Xan. I'm sorry.

501
00:35:02,014 --> 00:35:04,015
Hey.

502
00:35:04,515 --> 00:35:07,804
I was thinking, we should
probably work on the tracking.

503
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:10,901
See if we can find
where the signal comes from.

504
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:18,388
Yeah. Yeah, okay, sure, we can try.

505
00:35:19,924 --> 00:35:21,452
What's up, Maddie?

506
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:22,725
Hey, Xander.

507
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,072
Who's this?

508
00:35:24,649 --> 00:35:27,486
Friend of mine from the
Marine Bio class I'm taking.

509
00:35:27,686 --> 00:35:29,206
While you track that,

510
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:30,541
I'll try to find out more about the guy

511
00:35:30,566 --> 00:35:32,065
who was on the boat.

512
00:35:32,155 --> 00:35:33,702
I can talk to some of my colleagues

513
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,417
who did some research with the Navy,

514
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,534
see if they know anything.

515
00:35:37,628 --> 00:35:39,445
We're gonna find him, Xan.

516
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,647
In the car.

517
00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:28,368
All right. Okay, so... So we got...

518
00:36:28,593 --> 00:36:30,839
Michael Eaton at PRI.

519
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:32,320
No, no.

520
00:36:32,354 --> 00:36:35,223
Uh, maybe Amanda Cullen

521
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:37,592
or Professor Durbin at U-Dub.

522
00:36:38,055 --> 00:36:40,050
We could just send a few emails out,

523
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:41,329
nothing suspicious.

524
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,220
You know, just keep it real subtle.

525
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,631
How do you subtly ask about a mermaid?

526
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:51,131
We got to get you back to Helen's.

527
00:36:54,262 --> 00:36:56,797
If you find your sister,
what would you do?

528
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:01,234
Will you go home?

529
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,287
I don't think she understands.

530
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:11,626
Ryn, if you find your sister...

531
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,860
Yes.

532
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:01,302
She has a quality.

533
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:03,237
It's hard to explain.
I don't know, like...

534
00:39:06,173 --> 00:39:08,211
Like I was drawn to her.

535
00:39:12,146 --> 00:39:13,660
Me, too.

536
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:16,450
So his neck was broken

537
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:18,619
before he was thrown
through the window?

538
00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:20,553
Really?

539
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,750
Mm-hmm.

540
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:26,608
Well, you're gonna send
the report over, right?

541
00:39:27,162 --> 00:39:29,063
Non-human blood?

542
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:32,794
What the heck does that even mean?

543
00:39:33,261 --> 00:39:35,254
You mean like an animal or something?

544
00:39:37,205 --> 00:39:40,174
No. Have... Have Steve drop
it off at the house, all right?

545
00:39:44,394 --> 00:39:45,995
All right.

546
00:39:46,922 --> 00:39:48,616
I'll talk to you later.

547
00:39:49,017 --> 00:39:50,851
Everything okay?

548
00:39:51,283 --> 00:39:52,548
Oh, hey, Mads.

549
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,153
Hi.

550
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,276
- Ben.
- Hey.

551
00:39:56,824 --> 00:39:59,025
Yeah. Everything's fine.

552
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,649
Just a, uh, case I'm working on.

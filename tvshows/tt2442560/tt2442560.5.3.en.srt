1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:04,272
My name is Captain Swing, calling
from the occupied Six Counties.

2
00:00:04,274 --> 00:00:10,389
This Michael, your kin, making deals
with the very men who want you dead.

3
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:11,841
What happened on that ship?

4
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:14,998
Said the men from Glasgow
were called Billy Boys.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,958
Protestant razor gang.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,358
They run every man east of Glasgow.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,838
We have a mutual acquaintance.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,118
These gentlemen are the Billy Boys.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,878
I'm Jimmy.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,558
I need Mr Shelby to understand that
his best is not good enough.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,398
Your body will be the lesson.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,598
Tommy, what are you talking about?

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,438
I'm talking about an empty chair,
Ada.

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,758
My chair. My throne.

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,680
People think that I'm going to
fall, they start to circle.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,438
Who's going to take the throne, eh?

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,518
Black cat dreams are never wrong.

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,560
They crucified my son...

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,320
..for you.

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,040
Good morning, sisters.

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,120
Let us pray.

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,960
Our Father, who art in heaven...

23
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,600
..but deliver us from evil...

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,958
..for thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, for ever and ever...

25
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,360
..Amen.

26
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,118
You wanted to speak
to us, Mr Shelby?

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,398
Yeah.

28
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,398
-All of us?
-Yeah.

29
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,238
At 6.30 in the morning?

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,080
Yes.

31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,400
-We don't smoke in here.
-Well, I fucking do.

32
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,078
Nor do we use language.

33
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,398
Nor do we find fault in the
innocent.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,680
Yet you do.

35
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
You fucking do.

36
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,318
May I ask what this meeting is
about?

37
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,598
The Grace Shelby Foundation is the
biggest single source of funding

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,238
for this charitable institution,

39
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,278
devoted to the care of the orphaned
girls of south Birmingham, yeah?

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,198
For which we give thanks.

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,598
Uh-huh.

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,558
I have a temper similar to the one
described in that report.

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,318
Yet, unlike you,
I wait until I'm matched in size.

44
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,200
Whose report?

45
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
The testimony of children.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,480
Who have they spoken to?

47
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,038
-You'd have them only speak to God.
-God be their witness.

48
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,358
There is God,
and there are the Peaky Blinders.

49
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,758
This is Sparkhill, we're in Small
Heath.

50
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,158
We are much, much closer at hand
than God.

51
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,078
And we have heard terrible things.

52
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,398
We have, in this place,
children of the worst sort.

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,078
They lie as easily as breathe.

54
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,758
You had a child half black.

55
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,320
You made her wash with a different
soap.

56
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,078
Mr Shelby, your own sins are legend.

57
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,800
Our sins...

58
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,678
Our sins against the beating of
children

59
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,718
with bricks and hoses.

60
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
Our sins.

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,840
Our sins...

62
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,558
..against the black child
who hanged herself

63
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,400
for fear of your temper.

64
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,880
-I do not see how...
-You do not see!

65
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,600
Now put 'em on.

66
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,798
Put 'em on your face,

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,278
or it'll be your eyes that are
broken.

68
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,198
Please don't imagine that I won't
use this minute to do it,

69
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,558
or that I am afraid of your prayers

70
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,400
or your crosses.

71
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,680
You see the world broken.

72
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,198
Like those beaten children will.

73
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,120
Now look at me.

74
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,440
Look at me.

75
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,318
Look at me!

76
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,320
Funding withdrawn.

77
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,878
All children to be taken
into our own institutions.

78
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,758
You have no say in where the
children...

79
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,478
If I come for you,

80
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,638
and I still might yet decide
to come for you,

81
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,718
I will wear high heels
so you can hear my approach

82
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,398
on the cobblestones,
and have time to repent.

83
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,280
You listen for my footsteps.

84
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,360
Happy birthday, Pol.

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,600
They grow grand in the
horse shit, Pol.

86
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,040
Curly, pour some beer, eh?

87
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,358
The train to London leaves in an
hour.

88
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,278
Arthur, Michael, you're coming with
me.

89
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,958
Tommy, I have to take Gina
to the hospital today.

90
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:50,038
A week ago, one of our most trusted
men was killed by Jimmy McCavern.

91
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,838
The man we're going to speak
to in London

92
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,078
is establishing a relationship
with Jimmy McCavern.

93
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,718
So cancel your appointments,

94
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,758
and Ada can take Gina to the
hospital.

95
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,318
That's what women do.

96
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,400
And clean that shit off your shoes
before you get in my car, eh?

97
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,198
Michael, they will give it and give
it until your case is proven,

98
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,718
and then they'll take it.

99
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,998
From you, but mainly from me.

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,678
Polly, you go to the hospital
and speak to Aberama Gold.

101
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,118
You tell him there is a strategy in
place

102
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,158
to avenge the death of his son,

103
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,118
so not to do anything rash.

104
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,118
And take with you the heartfelt
condolences of the whole family.

105
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,518
Why me?

106
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,878
Because Aberama Gold is in love with
you. He even got a haircut.

107
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,958
And the smell of your perfume
might help ease his pain.

108
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,758
Tommy, I'm 45 years old today.

109
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,358
45 years old
and still breaking hearts, eh?

110
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,038
-Yeah!
-To Polly!

111
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,638
Polly Gray, hmm?

112
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,678
Polly.

113
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,518
Happy Birthday, Pol, yeah?

114
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,798
Curly, organise a wagon to take
Bonnie Gold's soul to heaven.

115
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,118
Isiah, fetch his boxing gloves
from the gym to burn with his body.

116
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,478
Michael, turn the Bentley around,
you've a train to catch.

117
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,560
And don't forget to wipe that shit
off your shoes, eh?

118
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,038
Just start up the car and drive.

119
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,238
So, what's the strategy?

120
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,598
You can smile.

121
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,160
You...don't smile.

122
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,760
Nice.

123
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,438
Very nice, Tom.

124
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,798
Hmm.

125
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,878
Although, I must say, I thought your
office would be bigger than this.

126
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,198
It will be.

127
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,958
Michael, you sit.

128
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,560
Arthur, you stand by the window.

129
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,078
So, who are we meeting?

130
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,598
The man we're about to meet

131
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,678
is the Minister
for the Duchy of Lancaster.

132
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,798
He's also deputy
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer

133
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,440
and Cabinet adviser to the Prime
Minister of Great Britain.

134
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,840
You've both met bad men before.

135
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,840
The man we're about to meet
is the devil.

136
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,920
Yep. Send him in.

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,560
I never seem to get to meet you
without your family.

138
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,160
I understand you know a man
called Jimmy McCavern.

139
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,960
May I take a cigarette?

140
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,360
Please.

141
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,000
Who on earth is Jimmy McCavern?

142
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,278
Over the last 12 months,

143
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,838
you've been making approaches
to various men across the country

144
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,280
who you think might be able
to help you in your cause.

145
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,198
McCavern is one of these men.

146
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,278
He runs the east Glasgow shipyards.

147
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,918
He killed an associate of mine.

148
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,320
I want to know what
your strategy is.

149
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,480
That one's your brother, yes?

150
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,520
Yes, and I'm his business adviser.

151
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,760
We would like to talk business.

152
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,398
Michael.

153
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,600
Michael Gray.

154
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,478
You lost all your cousin's money
in America, playing the fool.

155
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,278
A nightclub in Detroit called the
Gladiator was your regular.

156
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,678
You lost the money...

157
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,240
..and found a wife there.

158
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,238
And poor old Arthur Shelby standing
there at the window

159
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,798
is afraid his wife
will never return.

160
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,198
My spies tell me
she's been seen with another man.

161
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,718
Arthur...

162
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,160
Arthur.

163
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,638
And bingo.

164
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,318
20 seconds in, and I have them
speaking their wog lingo.

165
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,358
Mr Shelby, I do have plans.

166
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,720
I will have need of men like you.

167
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,920
Except, of course,
there is no other man like you.

168
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,800
You, in particular, I need.

169
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,238
But, please,

170
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,518
don't imagine I would trouble myself
with turf wars.

171
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,558
You have many enemies.

172
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,000
Shuffle the pack and
pick another card.

173
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,118
That investigation of the dead
journalist,

174
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,838
the queer...

175
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,640
..I've made that go away.

176
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,478
Read it and, uh, come back to me.

177
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,320
Next time, bring only an open mind
and a cigar to celebrate our union.

178
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,120
What the fuck was that all about,
Tom?

179
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,640
Fuck. Fuck.

180
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,878
Arthur!

181
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,518
Do not let them get
inside your head.

182
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,198
That's exactly how
these people work.

183
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,998
Who the fuck are these people, hmm?

184
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,040
Who the fuck are they?!

185
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,358
I've just been invited...

186
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,400
...to become the deputy leader
of a brand-new political party.

187
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,240
These people say
they are the future.

188
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,198
Do you want a drink?

189
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,080
I've stopped.

190
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,438
So, what have you decided?

191
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,760
I've been talking to the Friends.

192
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,958
-What friends?
-Quakers.

193
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,838
Friends who meet at the meeting
house in Bournville.

194
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,160
I'm staying in Bournville.

195
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,918
And what do they say?

196
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,600
They say I've been led astray.

197
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,958
If you've come to talk about
redemption,

198
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,758
you're talking to the wrong person.

199
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,520
I also went to a solicitor.

200
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,038
They heard my name was Shelby,
and suddenly they were too busy.

201
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,198
To divorce a Shelby man,

202
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,638
you have to go to a
solicitor in London.

203
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,078
I found one.

204
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,640
He said he'd represent me.

205
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,918
But I put the phone down.

206
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,520
Not through fear.

207
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,158
I chose this life.
It didn't choose me.

208
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,240
Also, Lizzie, one of the Friends is
a man.

209
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,080
He listens to me when I talk.

210
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,558
His wife died of the Spanish flu.

211
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,878
He has a daughter.

212
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,118
And you're considering making
this daughter an orphan?

213
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,318
-Nothing has happened.
-Nor will it.

214
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,360
He would die without his eyes.

215
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,518
And out of kindness,
Tommy would offer his daughter

216
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,438
a place in one of his institutions
for orphaned girls.

217
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,358
Or even take her into the family.

218
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,920
And it would begin again.

219
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,800
What is the thing, Linda?

220
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,440
The thing you can't put aside?

221
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,880
It's not Arthur.

222
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,560
It's who I am when he's there.

223
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,998
God hears every filthy word in my
head,

224
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,238
knows every dirty thing.

225
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,798
And your Friends don't use filthy
words?

226
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,318
If I fall this time,
I'll fall all the way.

227
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,440
Perhaps it's what you deserve,
with your filthy words.

228
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,118
I used to fuck seven men a day,

229
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,800
and now I'm learning
how to ride a horse side-saddle.

230
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,558
There's good and there's evil.

231
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,520
There's both mixed.

232
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,078
And that's Arthur and you...and me?

233
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,400
You don't get what you deserve,
you get what you take.

234
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
What about him?

235
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,000
He's making up his mind.

236
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,200
Someone called Polly Gray
to see you.

237
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,118
Yes or no?

238
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,558
Yes.

239
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,078
I've come to take you to the clinic.

240
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,678
I already told Michael,
my husband or no-one.

241
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,518
I've got a car.

242
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,398
They have taxis,
even in this fucking city.

243
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,798
Look, if they don't hear a heartbeat,
they're going to give you options.

244
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,440
None of them are nice.

245
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,598
I had my check-up three days ago.

246
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,438
They heard a beating heart.

247
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,758
But if they had told me
that baby had died inside of me,

248
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,600
I would have wanted someone with me.

249
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,118
My husband may do as he's told,

250
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,758
but, er, I don't.

251
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,518
Look, if they hear a heartbeat,
you won't need anybody with you,

252
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,318
cos you'll have the baby with you.

253
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,158
So I will leave you alone.

254
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,038
But if you get in a taxi in this
city and they hear your accent,

255
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,080
they'll take you on a grand tour.

256
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,320
Come on.

257
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,118
-So, when will Mum be home?
-She said she had to go to Birmingham.

258
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,278
-Do you want me to cook you something?
-Cook?

259
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,960
You're a man.

260
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,078
This is really not fair.

261
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,478
Your mother never told me
you were this good.

262
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,798
I'm in a club. I'm the champion.

263
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,838
I beat people even older than you.

264
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,320
Even older than me?

265
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,678
At school, some of the children say
that black people

266
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,478
and Jews are worse.

267
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,198
Worse than what?

268
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,600
Than anything.

269
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,038
And one teacher, Mr Hudson,

270
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,600
he calls my friend a little Jew boy.

271
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,958
Karl, these days,
there are some very stupid people

272
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,078
saying some very stupid things.

273
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,438
OK?

274
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,320
What do you think?

275
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,880
Checkmate.

276
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,558
I think, I don't want you to be my
dad.

277
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,880
Cos my dad's white...and he's in
heaven.

278
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,118
I came to see you in hospital
to tell you

279
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,558
there's a strategy in place,

280
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,638
not to break you out.

281
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,320
Don't worry,
my sister will look after me.

282
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,118
You must stay here,

283
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,040
and you'll let Tommy deal
with the men who killed your son.

284
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,080
You're 45 today.

285
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,480
I'm probably a bit older than that.

286
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,120
Probably.

287
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,440
I've dealt death.

288
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,880
Now death has dealt with me.

289
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,520
I have one more killing to do
then I'll be done.

290
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,160
Happy birthday, Polly Gray.

291
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,198
Get a car and a driver.

292
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,358
Find out where the Fury family are
camped.

293
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,758
I need their men to help me.

294
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,838
I'll need my hunting rifle,
50 bullets.

295
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,998
I'm going to Scotland.

296
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,920
Tonight.

297
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,678
I was expecting Ada.

298
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,718
Yeah. Give you a key, did she?

299
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,598
I was meant to meet her today, but
she said had to go to Birmingham.

300
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,398
Yes. Tommy sent her on a mission.
She's doing my job for me.

301
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,558
-Where's Karl, eh? Where's the boy?
-He went to buy an ice cream.

302
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,878
Ada said to tell you she'd be late.

303
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,558
-You knew I'd be here?
-Yeah, we knew you'd be here.

304
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,320
We have some business for you.

305
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,358
Any business I have with you,
Mr Shelby,

306
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,238
is meant to be strictly
confidential.

307
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,358
Ah, Michael. You still
have shit on your shoes.

308
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,558
-My associate here can evidently smell it.
-I don't mean any offence.

309
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,998
Here, Michael, go and find Karl

310
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,798
and buy him an ice cream, eh?

311
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,838
The man doesn't trust you.

312
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,800
Fuck you, Tom.

313
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,120
You know Gina phoned.

314
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
The baby's heart's beating strong.

315
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,198
And I swear to God, Tom,

316
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,078
by the time that baby draws
its first breath,

317
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,320
you and I will be done.

318
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,878
And you will be king.

319
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,600
Is that it, Michael?

320
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,918
You know, Tom,

321
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,878
there are doctors in London now

322
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,120
who can talk their way into your
head, dig out all the shit.

323
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,120
Perhaps, you should see one.

324
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,040
You're still not alone.

325
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,678
Me brother and I are the same
person.

326
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,798
Here.

327
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,558
Here's a letter from Mosley.

328
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,640
You should read it.

329
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,360
What investigation is he talking
about?

330
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,038
Two weeks ago, a journalist was
killed in Maida Vale.

331
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,198
The night before,
he'd come to me about some story

332
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,318
he was going to write about me.

333
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,598
We had nothing to do with that
killing.

334
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,200
Mosley wants you as his deputy?

335
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,518
His constituency is Smethwick.

336
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,278
It borders my own. He wants
Birmingham as his stronghold.

337
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,758
He knows I've...strong support
among working people.

338
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,718
We help him out at rallies,
show up at some town hall meetings.

339
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,958
Right, and why are you showing
this letter to me?

340
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,478
A Minister of State

341
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,198
who may have seditious intentions.

342
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,318
There's no proof of sedition
in this letter.

343
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,998
You work in intelligence, Younger.

344
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,318
You don't need proof.
Give it to your superiors.

345
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,598
Mr Shelby, I have a very specific
brief.

346
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,758
My brief is specifically
to gather information

347
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,800
on the activities of communists.

348
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,678
Your immediate superior
in the intelligence unit

349
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,758
is a Colonel Patrick Wyatt, yeah?

350
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,238
I understand he regularly plays polo
with Oswald Mosley.

351
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,718
They share membership of various
clubs in London and Birmingham.

352
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,158
I have specific orders.

353
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,598
I am a soldier.

354
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,440
You think you can join this family?

355
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,638
I have no intention of joining a
family.

356
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,398
Well, thank fuck for that,
cos, er, you'd hate our weddings.

357
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,198
Thought you said this was about
business.

358
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,278
Yes, family business
and government business,

359
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,080
all in one envelope.

360
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,598
Younger, listen to me.

361
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,358
Forget about Ada.

362
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,000
Forget about weddings.

363
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,840
You know what Mosley represents.

364
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,158
You know his philosophy.

365
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,918
I am planning to reply to him

366
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,400
and tell him that I'm
making up my mind.

367
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,998
But in the meantime,
you need to give me instruction.

368
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,478
I could fight him on my own, if I
have to,

369
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,998
or I could join his organisation

370
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,280
and undermine him on
behalf of the King.

371
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,720
But you need to make a decision.

372
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,960
I suppose there are a few things
I can do on my own initiative.

373
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,640
On your fucking feet.

374
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,318
Hello, Tom.

375
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,318
I thought you were staying over in
London.

376
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,518
Hello, Johnny.

377
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,958
How are you, eh?

378
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,518
How are your ribs?

379
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,198
You managing?

380
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,998
-Just about Tom, yeah.
-Yeah? Good.

381
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,078
And who's that?

382
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,840
Is it Maisie, or is it Clara?

383
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,238
Ah! Sandra.

384
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,158
Well, may I say,

385
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,918
your breakfasts are a great
improvement.

386
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,078
Mr Shelby, I'm sorry.

387
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,598
Don't worry, Sandra.

388
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,798
The only way to get fired
from this household

389
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,678
is through burnt toast...

390
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,278
..or talking to the police.

391
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,958
Go on, go to bed.

392
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,320
And, Sandra...

393
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,760
..everything Johnny said is lies.

394
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,558
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny...

395
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,558
While you was gone,
I got a message, Tom.

396
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,358
A cousin of Aberama Gold
galloped from Meriden.

397
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,438
He said Aberama wants you to know
that he's gone to Scotland

398
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,598
to deal with his business himself,

399
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,840
and that you'd know what that meant.

400
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,518
Fuck!

401
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,198
The boy said Aberama arrived
from the hospital

402
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,040
in Polly's Bentley.

403
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,080
She fucking helped him.

404
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,638
She fucking helped him!

405
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,838
But it can't be love,
cos it's Polly.

406
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,480
Cos it's fucking Polly.

407
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,678
All right, Johnny.
I have a job for you.

408
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,078
Tom, I'm in a lot of pain here.

409
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,038
I need you to go and find
Aberama Gold.

410
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,678
He has kin on the Lothian border,
the Fury family.

411
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,078
Ah, for fuck's sake, Tom!

412
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,478
The Furys, they don't even use words
to fucking talk.

413
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,438
Just hand gestures and fucking
howls.

414
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,558
You will go to them
and you will find him.

415
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,398
Tom, I am in fucking pain here.

416
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,478
-Yeah, you appear to be managing.
-I said I was just managing.

417
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,038
Well, you can just manage
to sit in a car with Arthur

418
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,598
and follow the patrin
to find the Fury family.

419
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,758
Arthur will take care of everything
that requires bones and muscles.

420
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,678
I warned you, Tom. The Golds'll be
the death of one of us.

421
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,638
And it looks like it's going to be
fucking me!

422
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,280
Well, go on, open it.

423
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,000
So...

424
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,278
..you heard the baby's heartbeat
today.

425
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,038
Beats so fast.

426
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,678
Would have been a birthday gift
enough.

427
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,440
A new life.

428
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,238
Liberty.

429
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,000
Freedom.

430
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,278
Feels like a weapon.

431
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,518
I only came because Michael's
driving back from London

432
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,840
and he said he didn't want you
to be on your own.

433
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,718
So...

434
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,118
Whose idea was the gift of freedom?

435
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,080
Mine.

436
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,718
You want to take Michael
and the baby to New York?

437
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,000
Yes.

438
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,838
The baby will have two grandmothers.

439
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,998
The other one lives...

440
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,558
The other one lives amongst human
beings.

441
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,400
The other one is a human being.

442
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,518
It's all right, I'm not drunk.

443
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,598
I'm just free.

444
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,118
So, what do you want?

445
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,760
My approval?

446
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,998
Your help.

447
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,998
Michael wants you to come with us.

448
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,480
We can all live in Long Island,
right on the beach.

449
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,280
Isn't Long Island in Australia?

450
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,358
Or is it in California,
amongst the Indians?

451
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,880
It's in New York, Polly.

452
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,200
You see, we all try and get away.

453
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,920
But we never do.

454
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,240
I wish I felt that heartbeat today.

455
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,000
You're starting to sound
a little sorry for yourself.

456
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,518
I'm an American.

457
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,838
We don't just go round
and round and round.

458
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,000
We go in a straight line.

459
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,600
And my baby...will be born in
New York.

460
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,400
I'm not happy about moving this
meeting to licensed premises.

461
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,518
You've saved your union the train
fare, and you hate London anyway.

462
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,838
We're looking for popular speakers
for our upcoming rally.

463
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,038
You're making quite a name for
yourself in the Commons.

464
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,198
Betty!

465
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,358
What are you drinking?

466
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,640
Water.

467
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,838
-Bottle of champagne, Betty.
-You'll drink it on your own.

468
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,078
That's the idea.

469
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,920
Shall we sit down, Miss Eden?

470
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,238
Revolution.

471
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,560
So, how is life as a socialist?

472
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,078
This glass.

473
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,600
The bubbles.

474
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,880
They rise to the top.

475
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,438
Each bubble has the same chance to
rise.

476
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,438
That is a very peculiar form of
socialism.

477
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,520
And this bottle.

478
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,440
Once the cork comes out...

479
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,758
..you can't get it back in.

480
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,680
You need to finish what you started.

481
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,600
It's cleverness, that's all.

482
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,358
So you're playing at this.

483
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,318
People can be turned around.

484
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,838
Even your people.

485
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,918
-My people?
-Yeah.

486
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,398
For them, it's just the same.

487
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,960
Communism. Fascism.

488
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,158
For most people,
it's an apple and an apple.

489
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,318
Fascism is the subject of the rally.

490
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,238
I want you to speak against it.

491
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,960
In answer to your question...

492
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,080
..I cannot address your rally...

493
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,840
..because it's not part
of the current strategy.

494
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,878
Are you OK, Thomas?

495
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,078
Do you want a man to carry you home?

496
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,960
I knew we should not have had this
meeting on licensed premises.

497
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,960
Happy or sad, Thomas?

498
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,920
I warn you, I'll break your heart.

499
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,120
I didn't expect you home.

500
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,038
Frances said Linda was here today.

501
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,960
Frances has a very
specific loyalty, doesn't she?

502
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,040
Well, people are loyal
to those who pay their wages.

503
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,158
Also, Maggie at the exchange
said you made some calls.

504
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,240
Then you'll know I called a
solicitor.

505
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,920
Did Maggie listen in to the
conversation?

506
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,158
He said he'd represent me.

507
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,478
But I put the phone down.

508
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,680
There and then, I made a decision.

509
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,800
And when I heard your car pull up,
I got changed.

510
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,120
You said, in your head,
you still pay for it.

511
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,158
So I've decided to continue
to take the payment

512
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,998
and balance my heart against my
head,

513
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,878
as though it were a book of
accounts.

514
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,160
-I value my head a shilling more.
-Huh!

515
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,760
When was the last time you had to
worry about shillings, eh?

516
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,998
People are loyal to those
who pay their wages.

517
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,040
That's why I'll be loyal to you.

518
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,758
But this is the deal.

519
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,838
You don't fuck anybody else in my
house,

520
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,998
nor within a day
of holding our child by the hand.

521
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,600
A day on either side.

522
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,798
And you let me in sometimes.

523
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,720
Into your head.

524
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,718
To clear it out.

525
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,440
That what needs clearing out.

526
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,040
Agreed.

527
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,838
And this...

528
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,600
Always.

529
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,878
The deal is...

530
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,160
..you belong to me.

531
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,318
My property.

532
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,280
No-one touches my property.

533
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,278
I touch myself, but it's still you
anyway.

534
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,840
So that's why I put the phone down.

535
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,438
No, Tom.

536
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,720
We do it in the bed at least.

537
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,600
Everything is mine, Lizzie.

538
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Everything.

539
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,198
Arthur.

540
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,118
-Hmm?
-Frances was right.

541
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,558
Linda was here today.

542
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,238
Fuck.

543
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,120
What did she say, huh?

544
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,798
-I just want to talk to her, that's all.
-Arthur, listen.

545
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,278
First, I need you to go to Scotland

546
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,078
and bring back Aberama Gold.

547
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,638
Then we'll go and we'll find Linda.

548
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,038
No, no, no, no.

549
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,080
I'll keep calling you, Tom.

550
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,558
You know I will.

551
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,320
I'll call this number back...

552
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,518
..again, again and again.

553
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,918
If you don't answer,

554
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,118
I'll jump in my fucking car

555
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,640
and I'll drive to your house,
you know I will.

556
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,838
I'll stay there all night if
I have to. I won't go nowhere,

557
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,598
not Scotland

558
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,240
till you tell me what
it is you know.

559
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,718
Right, listen to me.

560
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,278
I don't have an address.

561
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,880
But she's with the Quakers in
Bournville.

562
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,280
Apparently,
there is someone who is a Friend.

563
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,118
He had a wife who died
from Spanish flu in 1918.

564
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,918
And he has a daughter.

565
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,918
That should be enough to find him.

566
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,438
Arthur...

567
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,680
Just talk to him
and get a message to Linda.

568
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,918
Nothing happened, Arthur.

569
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,918
He's a Quaker, a Friend.

570
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,158
They're not like us, they talk.

571
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,998
Oh, I'll speak to him.

572
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,718
Man to man.

573
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,838
And then, after that...

574
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,158
..I'll go up north, hmm.

575
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,518
Deal with our business.
I promise you.

576
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,640
Arthur. Arthur, listen to me...

577
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,198
Who were you talking to?

578
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,398
I have to ask you, cos Maggie at the
exchange won't tell me.

579
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,598
Who was it?

580
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,638
Was it Arthur?

581
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,758
I need my brother in one piece.

582
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,040
Arthur makes his own decisions.

583
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,358
You marry a Shelby,

584
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,280
you stay fucking married.

585
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,320
Fuck.

586
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,198
Well, look at this, hmm.

587
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,678
Can I help you?

588
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,078
Yeah, I think you can.

589
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,998
I'm looking for Linda Shelby.

590
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,200
Do you know her?

591
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,080
Eh? I'm Arthur.

592
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,678
Her husband.

593
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,720
If you're her husband,
she doesn't want to talk to you.

594
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,718
Well, look at you.

595
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,518
Ain't you smart? Eh?

596
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,598
What, you got all the fucking
answers, have you?

597
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,278
Well, let's try you with
another one. Eh?

598
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,798
Let's try you with another one.
How about...

599
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,838
How about we search
for the fucking truth within, hmm?

600
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,998
Let's have a look, eh? Let's have a
look.

601
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,718
See what we've got inside here, eh?

602
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,040
You fucking bastard!

603
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,038
Eh? You want to keep looking, eh?

604
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,118
Hey, I will ask you again.

605
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,518
Eh? Eh?

606
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,680
I'll ask you again.

607
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,598
Where is she? Eh?

608
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,880
Where is she?

609
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,118
-Eh? Eh?
-No. No, no, no...

610
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,520
I'm a good man.

611
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,560
I'm a fucking good man, like you.

612
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,080
A God-fearing man.

613
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,560
There is good in my heart.

614
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,120
There is good in my heart!

615
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,798
But my hands...

616
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,240
These hands belong to the devil.

617
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,000
The fucking devil!

618
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,040
Wait... Who are you?

619
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,598
Did she come back?

620
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,598
No.

621
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,998
Is she in Scotland?
Is that why you're going?

622
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,240
No, she's not in fucking
Scotland, Charlie.

623
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,398
Whisky. We want whisky.

624
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,918
Maps. Cigars.

625
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,518
Load the van, we want it all.

626
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,878
Who's "we?"

627
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,398
Me and Johnny Dogs.

628
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,358
Ah.

629
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,960
So it's you and Johnny Dogs
against Scotland?

630
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,238
You know, at the BSA,
our friends could get you

631
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,918
some of them new artillery cannons
that fire ten shells a second.

632
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,038
You can mount one
on the roof of your fucking car.

633
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,878
Petrol. We need petrol.

634
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,160
It's so far up north,
they run out of the bloody stuff.

635
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,880
Yeah. Still riding round on fucking
chariots, they are.

636
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,758
Curly, Arthur is going to Scotland,
so he needs hand grenades.

637
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,998
-How many?
-Fuck's sake, it's like it's normal.

638
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,918
Our friends at the BSA
still have lots left from the war,

639
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,958
but we can't give them...

640
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,038
Get me some hand grenades, Curly,
eh? Hmm?

641
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,758
You find 'em back there, eh?
Good boy, yeah?

642
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,198
You get me some.
Put them on my account.

643
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,520
Yeah.

644
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,438
How many?

645
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,600
-Three, Curly.
-Three. Three.

646
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,120
Find a way of getting
her back, Arthur.

647
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,280
Without her, you're as
good as dead already.

648
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,040
That's them, the Billy Boys!

649
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,718
Gentlemen.

650
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,440
You have just crossed the border
into the County of East Tollcross.

651
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,478
Now, according
to the unwritten constitution

652
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,238
of Tollcross County,

653
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:56,238
Gypsies, Catholics and other
criminally minded individuals

654
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,758
are not allowed to work the roads
of our Protestant district

655
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,878
on account of the poor quality
of their labour.

656
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,758
So, my own boys
will be taking over from here.

657
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,678
We will be needing your tools,

658
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,518
your tar, your burner...

659
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,718
..and your transportation.

660
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,198
You're Gypsies,

661
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,558
you can easily steal another.

662
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,080
I have the keys to the truck.

663
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,280
Ah!

664
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,800
Now...

665
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,478
..I want you boys to take a message
back to Jimmy McCavern.

666
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,238
You killed my son.

667
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,920
You hoisted him on a cross!

668
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,080
Now, in this gun...

669
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,638
..there's a bullet

670
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,240
and on it is carved the name
McCavern.

671
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,358
And when the time comes
for his crucifixion,

672
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:49,920
it will be me who drives in the
nails.

673
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,718
Mr Shelby!

674
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,280
At last you are alone.

675
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,440
I think we'll make quite the team.

676
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,718
The pheasants won't know
what hit them.

677
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,520
You're a fine shot, Mr Shelby.

678
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,560
You were in the yeomanry, yes?

679
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,638
Were you cavalry?

680
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,558
You won the
Distinguished Service Medal.

681
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,640
That'll help.

682
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,920
With what?

683
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,878
Two months ago, I was in Rome.

684
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,240
I met Mr Mussolini.

685
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,040
You and I and men like him...

686
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,080
..we will shape the future.

687
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,440
When will you resign
from the Labour Party?

688
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,080
The day before I announce
the formation of my new party.

689
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,920
The British Union of Fascists will
be born on January 1st of next year.

690
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,520
The first day of a new decade.

691
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,320
The 1930s, Mr Shelby,
will belong to us.

692
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,160
Did you bring that cigar?

693
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,398
Before we smoke...

694
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,800
..I have some conditions.

695
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,560
It really isn't going to be
that kind of relationship.

696
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,160
Just smoke like the fine man
you will become.

697
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,998
Yes, Colonel Ben Younger.

698
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,960
I have an allocated confidential
line - code 78.

699
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,838
It's me.

700
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,478
I've agreed to work with our friend.

701
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,278
He's going to announce on
January 1st.

702
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,278
I need to know that my position
as informant against him

703
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,200
is officially sanctioned.

704
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,718
Today, gentlemen,

705
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,398
we are avenging an unprovoked attack

706
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,838
on members of our organisation

707
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:02,398
who were simply carrying out
a routine border patrol.

708
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,358
Our enemies are Gypsies,

709
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:09,198
members of a race destined
for natural eradication anyway,

710
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,440
due to what the
scientists call selection.

711
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:18,078
And since these beggars
are unchristened and unregistered,

712
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,558
the local constabulary
will as soon drop them

713
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,480
in a communal grave
as find a name for a gravestone.

714
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,560
So proceed in any manner you choose
to find the fugitive we seek.

715
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,278
Morning, Mr Gold.

716
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,438
The Billy Boys are coming for you.

717
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,120
How the fuck did you find me?

718
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:52,078
-How the fuck did they find me?
-I kind of let it slip.

719
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,520
Give you no choice, eh?
What, hmm? What?

720
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,438
And a Bentley outside, the engine
running.

721
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,918
Fastest engine in the world,
apparently, which is good.

722
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,878
We've got two minutes to
get out of here.

723
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,438
We are officers of the East
Lanarkshire Special Constabulary.

724
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,960
We are seeking a man
by the name of Aberama Gold.

725
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,800
Hand the gentleman over,
and no-one else will be harmed.

726
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,840
Fuck! Take cover!

727
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,118
So, Tommy Shelby...

728
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,400
..it's war you want...

729
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,160
..it's war you shall have.

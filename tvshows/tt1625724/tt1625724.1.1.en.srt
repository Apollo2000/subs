VIDEO INSTRUCTOR: To field strip
a Glock.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,799
The first thing you want to do is
make sure the Glock is empty.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,319
Lock the slide back,
remove the magazine.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,239
The magazine is empty,
open up the slide.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,240
Keep your finger off the trigger. Double check.
No round in the chamber.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,479
With the Glock, you need to pull the
trigger to disassemble it.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,159
It's bad boy bitch,
Scram Jones,

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,279
the Clipse B I G, let's go.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,959
Niggaz in my faction
don't like asking questions.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,439
Strictly gun testing,
coke measuring.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,639
Giving pleasure in the Benzito.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,159
Hitting fanny, spendin' chips at
Manny's.

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,879
Hope you creeps got receipts,
My peeps get dirty like cleats.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,679
Run up in your crib, wrap you in
your Polo sheets.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,679
Six up in your wig piece,
nigga decease.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,719
May you rest in peace.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,239
With my Sycamore style,
more sicker than yours.

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,759
Four, four, and fifty four draw.

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,919
As my pilot steers my Leer.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,679
Yes my dear, shit's official,
only the Feds I fear.

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,799
Here's a tissue, stop your blood
clot crying.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,279
The kids, the dog,
everybody dyin', no lying.

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,319
So don't you get suspicious,

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,159
I'm Big dangerous,
you're just a Likkle Vicious.

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,239
As I leave my competition,
respirator style.

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,999
Climb the ladder to success,
escalator style.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,599
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all,
death controls y'all.

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,919
Big don't fold y'all.

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,039
I spit phrases that'll thrill you.

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,520
You're nobody till somebody kills
you.

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,599
Do you know where you're going to.

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,599
Just a memory, everybody dying,

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,120
death controls y'all,
Your nobody till somebody kills you.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,480
Biggie Duets,

35
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,879
or Born Again,

36
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,159
Life After Death...

37
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,839
VIDEO INSTRUCTOR: Once you've done
that, reach up behind the Glock ear,

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,639
roll your finger over the top
and slowly squeeze back.

39
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,759
It'll come back about
a quarter of an inch.

40
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,279
There's a release button on both
sides of the Glock.

41
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,999
It's called the slide lock.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,719
Go ahead and pull both of them at the
same time and let the slide go forward.

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,320
Shit!

44
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,240
KNOCK ON DOOR > Nigel?

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,160

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,679

50
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,399
Yesterday, I'd Warren on my lap here
looking for The Tweenies.

51
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,079
And do you know what pops up
instead?

52
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,840
Some young one with two big...

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,239
I'm not even going to say it.
It was disgusting.

54
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,479
What are you talking about?

55
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,879
Nidge, I don't want you looking up
that filth on the computer.

58
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,159
They come with a free football.
All his friends have them.

59
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,440
What friends?
His friends at the creche.

60

71
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,119
Cause when I frequent the spots
that I'm known to rock.

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,639
You hear the bass from this truck
when I'm on the block,

Ladies, they pay homage,

They say rap's changed, they want

All I want is 5 minutes to show you that my little
brother wasn't a nobody. I didn't say he was.

312
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,939
This is a picture of the 3 of us
all together.

313
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,299
That's him there.
That's my brother.

314
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,659
This is a school picture of him.

315
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,459
This is another school picture of
him. That's my brother.

316
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,019
This is us at my eldest child
Grainne's Christening.

317
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,979
He was the godfather.

318
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,139
That's him with his football team.
See him there?

319
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:09,459
That's him before a match at Croker.
See him smiling? That's my brother.

320
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,339
And this is one of the last
photographs I have of him.

321
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,420
That's my brother.

322
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,220
And what does gangland mean anyway?

323
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,460
Call Nidge, will you, Mary?
Okay.

324
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,619
What are you waiting for?
A receipt?

325
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,419
Is that him clear now?

326
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,219
No, he owes another 2 grand.
But that's 20,000 I've given you.

327
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,859
Yeah, but he owes us 22. Could you
not have asked them for 22?

328
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,379
20, that's the most the Credit Union
will give me.

329
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,459
What about the bank, no?

330
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,779
I don't know where I'll get it from.

331
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,459
You'll have to borrow it from
someone, won't you?

332
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,459
What did you say to the
Credit Union?

333
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,700
Will he be alright? I don't know.

334
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,220
Will he?

335
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,459
TRISH: Darren has been arrested.
I know. Arseholes!

336
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,059
You'd think they'd wait till after
the funeral.

337
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,299
Will you tell her it's going to be
okay.

338
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,539
He's got the best criminal brief in
town, Mary.

339
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,299
I rang the Gardai.
They won't tell me anything.

340
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,019
He's before the District Court at
11.

341
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,299
Will he get bail, do you think?
Of course he'll get bail, Mary.

342
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,219
I don't know.
He should, but you never know.

343
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,499
Shut up, you!
You're making it worse.

344
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,419
Mary, of course he'll get bail.

345
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,299
I'm going down the courtroom now.
You can come if you want, Mary.

346
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,739
Darren said it was mandatory 10
years he could get for it. For what?

347
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,859
For possession. For having a gun in
the house. Aw Mary, Mary, Mary.

348
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,619
It was a 9-millimetre
semi-automatic.

349
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,379
Not a bleedin' rocket launcher he
had, okay?

350
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,499
Jesus, he'll get 5 tops.

351
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,419
Shut up, you!
You're making it worse.

352
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,020
Mary, don't worry about it.
I'll get it sorted, okay?

353
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,220
(MARY SOBBING)

354
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,100
MUSIC

355
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,419
Good man, Pat.
The cops are stupid.

356
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,619
Imagine putting the wrong date on
the search warrant.

357
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,579
It doesn't matter now that he bungs
off to Spain, no?

358
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,099
Well, he was never arrested,
so technically,

359
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,539
this is the first time the bench
warrant has been served on him. Magic!

360
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,979
You've got to love the law.

361
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,179
DARREN: So Pat, what happens now?

362
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,939
They set a trial date
and they'll let me know.

363
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,859
That's bullshit!
It was a defective warrant.

364
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,819
What are you? Judge Judy? I'm saying
the warrant doesn't apply.

365
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,739
Am I right, Pat?
It doesn't make any sense.

366
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,299
What's the use in going to trial if
the warrant isn't worth shit? I know.

367
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,779
I'm going to write a letter to the
Chief State Solicitor's office

368
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,779
and we'll take it from there.
But they mightn't pursue it.

369
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,259
See? I told you. Shut up, you.

370
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,419
What do you mean they mightn't pursue
it?

371
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,299
Well, if the whole basis of a potential
trial rests on a defective warrant...

372
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,899
Sure all that was wrong with it was
the date. It doesn't matter.

373
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,859
If they think they'll get a
conviction, they'll run with it

374
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,939
but there's a good chance they won't
because of this. Why not?

375
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,859
The cost to the State.

376
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,459
Serious? I told you.

377
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,699
Why not just tell me this now,
get it over and done with?

378
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,099
Because there might be some little
bollix in here,

379
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,739
he'll think he wants to piss away
a couple of million going after you.

380
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,179
There's always a little bollix
somewhere, isn't there?

381
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,299
So I don't have to do anything then?
No.

382
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,419
I'll write that letter and we'll
take it from there. Right, cheers.

383
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,899
But you won't be able to leave the
jurisdiction until all this is sorted,

384
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,779
and keep your head down.

385
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,339
You'll have to get a job!

386
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,339
Here, how are we going to work this,
by the way? For paying you.

387
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,020
You don't have to pay me.
It's sorted.

388
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,499
I spit phrases that'll thrill you,

389
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,900
you're nobody until somebody kills
you.

390
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,739
Do you know where you're going to?

391
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,579
Just a memory, everybody dying.

392
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,979
When I throw my clip in the AK,
may you rest in peace,

393
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,859
you're nobody till somebody kills
you.

394
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,939
Do you know where you're going to?

395
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,980
Just a memory,

396
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,820
everybody dying,

397
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,740
you're nobody till somebody kills
you.

398
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,539
Label limbo,
I treat it like the wind blows,

399
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,339
my back don't bend,
see papi is my kinfolk.

400
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,179
Spin out the work
as if it's on a ten spoke,

401
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,219
sole benefactor, the Benz,
he made the rims poke.

402
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,059
Trust me, they can't touch P
in one touchy,

403
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,459
Turn drop-head coupe to
dune-buggy.

404
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,099
Admire the verses,
they're inspired by the hearses

405
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,419
that carried my niggas
and had the church mothers cursing.

406
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,659
Imagine the glamour that comes out
the flow

407
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,099
of a nigga who still play in the
snow like Santa.

408
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,379
The wrist is rushing
my ears is blushing

409
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,940
and the diamonds in my chain
big as grandma's buttons...

410
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,380
Howya, Stumpy. Is Rosemary coming to
pay her respects as well?

411
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,500
Brendan, you should sit with us.
You're still family.

412
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,700
Thanks very much.

413
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,979
John Boy. Howya, Darren.

414
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,099
You got bail okay, yeah? Yeah, yeah.

415
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,579
That's the business, you know?
Thanks, I appreciate it.

416
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,339
I'm sorry about Robbie.
It's terrible.

417
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,019
I know this is no use to you
but I'm going to say it anyway.

418
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,179
Whoever did this...
you know what I'm saying? Yeah.

419
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,739
Because we don't forget.
I'll talk to you later.

420
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:20,659
You know we're going to sort this
out. I'll talk to you later. Yeah.

421
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,020
Sorry, brother. Thanks.

422
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,340
Sorry, Darren. Cheers.
Thanks for coming.

423
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,460
Trish.

424
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,140
Thank you.

425
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,699
Nidge, man. Good to see you.

426
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,660
See you soon. Thanks for coming.

427
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,820
Hey, Rosie.

428
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,260
I'm so so sorry. Yeah, I know.

429
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,099
I would have come over last night
except I didn't find out till late.

430
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,579
I should have just... No, no.

431
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,740
We weren't able to bring him home
till now.

432
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,820
I'm so so sorry.

433
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,099
Are you saying hello, Grainne?
Remember Darren's Rosie?

434
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,700
Hi, girls.

435
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,740
They've got so big in a year.

436
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,059
Here, I heard last night
Jimmy Byrne has skipped town.

437
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,979
Is he the fella Robbie glassed
inside?

438
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,379
The scar he has on the side of his
face from it!

439
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,860
Where did you hear this?
I was down the Chinaman last night.

440
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,899
Are you going to say it to Darren?

441
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,059
The brother is going to say it to
him after this.

442
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,299
JOHN BOY: Did you not have your
breakfast, no? I'm hungry.

443
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,779
Could you not have eaten it inside?

444
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,260
I can't eat with your man in the
coffin in there.

445
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,940
Rosie?

446
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,780
Will you...

447
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,180
Will you hold back? Of course.

448
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,260
> Sorry.

449
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,620
Here, Nidge!

450
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,179
STUMPY: What's keeping her?

451
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,780
NIDGE: Okay, family only now,
please. Just the family, yeah?

452
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,819
You can't come in, Stump.
I need to take a piss.

453
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,179
I have to lock the door.

454
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,099
They're closing the coffin now.
I'm closing the door.

455
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,220
I won't be two minutes.
You can fuck off.

456
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,660
DARREN: I hate this. I know.

457
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,019
I have to close the lid.

458
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,579
It can wait if you want.
You don't have to do it now.

459
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:55,419
I just don't want this to be
happening, you know? I know.

460
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,859
Yeah?

If you want to spend more time with
him, do it now, okay?

Is that what you want?

463
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,659
No, I have to do it now.
Yeah, yeah.

464
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,540
Will you stay here? Okay.

465
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,739
Here, girls, do you want to put your
teddies in now?

Okay, here.

I meant to get them before but...

They're supposed to protect you,
so...

479

I forgot to put it in the coffin.

you. It should have been me.

It's so final.

I don't want to leave him.

491

All he had to do was pick him up.

I could have hooked you up over
there, you know? Where? Spain.

I said it to Robbie, you know?

00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,349
Don't know if he said it but
I bought this place over there.

you're talking about brushed concrete.

a call, you know?

Up from West Africa.

enough for a bit. Alright.

Are you going to stick around? Yeah.

506
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,029
Well, I have to for the court case.
Ah yeah.

I'll sort you out.

For Pat's fees? Yeah.

Ah, I give him tons of business.
It's nothing.

510
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:17,470
No, I'll pay you back.
Ah no, it's nothing.

Here, I'd better go over...
Go on. Right.

How are you bearing up?
I'm tired. Are you?

514
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,749
That was depressing. Yeah.

515

I hate funerals.
I'm not a big fan myself.

516
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,509
Do you not think that was a bit
morbid? What?

517
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,429
Having the body in the house like
that.

518

What else was she going to do with
him?

519
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,190
Leave him in a funeral home.

this thing for?

got to get back for Warren or something.

Get a few rum and Cokes in me and
I'll be alright.

Yeah, get us another one of them.

Don't be such a prick, Nigel!
I'm only saying.

I near reared him myself.

It was an accident,
he said in court.

546
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:28,349
I suppose you all know he went and
hid Tony's body for a few weeks,

547
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:34,389
which is something, as God is my
witness, I'll never forgive him for.

548
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,869
Bastard judge wouldn't let me read
a victim impact statement

Why, where do you want to go?
Nowhere.

I mean to keep warm. Oh right.

Yeah, okay.

Talking to Darren yet? No.

I shook hands with him earlier.
He's not even talking to me.

Would you blame him? No.

568

Do you think I should say something
to him?

569

Are you mad?
You'll get your head kicked in.

570
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,030
Just leave him alone, will you?

What's wrong with you?
I don't know what to do.

572

Have a drink and leave him alone.

573
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:15,069
I'd love just not to go back in.

574
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,909
Just leave right now.

575

Like the last time?

576
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,029
I'd bring you with me this time
though.

577

And I'm sorry for all the way it
happened.

578
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,270
It doesn't matter. No, it does.

579
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,269
Because I was thinking when the cops
raided the house,

580
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:37,789
they'd know that you didn't know anything
because I didn't say anything to you.

581
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:41,110
And you didn't know, did you? No.

582
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,869
I didn't think you'd come with me.

583

do?

You don't know when to shut up.

It's not even funny.
I thought it was funny.

if you'd asked me. Yeah?

Yeah, but you didn't ask me. I know.

596
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,869
Why didn't you?
Because I'm stupid, aren't I?

597
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,909

Ah, Hughie mouthing off.

brother, half-brother, whatever he is,

I'd kill him, I would.

Sorry, Darren, no of fence, yeah?
No, right.

I thought you were gone or
something. No.

You shouldn't be smoking, Rosemary.

You shouldn't be smoking, no?

No.

616
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,829
Alright, catch you later.
Seeya later.

617
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:58,070
And this is my niece, Siobhan.

618
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,189
Buy us a drink, Nidge, will you?
You're too young to be drinking.

619
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:04,149
What are you talking about? I'm 17.
My da lets me drink.

620
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:06,670
Uh... no, he doesn't.

621
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:10,389
Go on, I'll get you one.
What do you want? Vodka.

622
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,150
You can have a beer.

623
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:18,830
Don't let your da catch you with
that.

624
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,670
You look sad.

625
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,709
It's a funeral, isn't it?

626
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,349
Was Robbie a good friend of yours?

627
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,750
Yeah.

628
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,870
What are you doing there?
Bluetooth.

629
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:41,310
Is that you, is it? Uh...

630
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,950
yeah.

Do you know Jimmy Byrne?

634
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,829
Jimmy Byrne? I thought he got
transferred.

635
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,949
Yeah, he did, but he's been out for
2 months now.

636
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,909
Yeah, but Robbie has been in a lot of
scraps.

637
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,509
Well, he got this peacock right down
one side of his face.

638
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,789
Your man had been mouthing off
apparently,

639

Robbie done.

No-one knows where he is.

642
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,589
He came in the Chinaman the other
night, though,

643
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:42,309
grinning from ear to ear like he won
the Lotto, Hughie was saying.

644
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:44,309
And no-one has seen him? No.

645
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:46,750
He's done a bunk.

646
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,989
And the only other thing is...

647
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:55,429
I don't even want to say this but
I'm going to say it anyway. What?

648
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,830
Tommy.

649
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:02,509
Tommy was supposed to pick him up,
wasn't he? Yeah.

650

As leaders, we have an
accountability to the protocols,

She has a criminal history.

157
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:49,642
Her criminal history has nothing
to do with this case.

You don't get

00:08:00,704 --> 00:08:02,392
Yes.

163
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:06,275
You have to make things equal.

164
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,056
They are not equal,
Madam Mayor,

165
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:09,884
because she is a criminal and
he isn't.

166
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,353
Are you telling me
that you won't do it?

167
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:14,236
That's exactly
what I'm telling you.

168
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:15,962
Then you're fired.

169
00:08:27,954 --> 00:08:30,095
<i>You still haven't answered
my question.</i>

170
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:33,774
You had so many, I lost track.

171
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:36,767
Why do you really want
to hang up your shield?

172
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,447
Why does everybody care

173
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,361
whether I put
my papers in or not?

174
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:45,079
Because, for years, being a cop
has defined who you are,

175
00:08:45,556 --> 00:08:48,012
and you're good at it,
and you love it.

176
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:49,381
I don't love it anymore.

177
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:50,443
And because you need

178
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,017
to retire because
it's what you really want,

179
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:55,259
and not as a reaction
to what's happened

180
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:56,449
these past few months.

181
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:58,228
Come on, what difference
does it make?

182
00:08:58,432 --> 00:09:01,233
It'll make a difference
to your family.

183
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,189
I know you blame yourself

184
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:07,533
for the house,

185
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,526
but it was just that.

186
00:09:09,922 --> 00:09:11,314
The house.

187
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:14,056
You guys were the ones
that made it a home.

188
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:16,859
Isn't that what Linda said
to you when it burned down?

189
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:18,954
It didn't burn down.

190
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:20,986
It was torched.

191
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,322
It wasn't your fault.

192
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,603
It <i>was</i> my fault!

193
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:27,189
Don't you get it?!

194
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:29,634
The house was my fault,
the fire was my fault,

195
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:32,025
and Linda was my fault!

196
00:09:34,618 --> 00:09:35,819
Where you going?

197
00:09:35,877 --> 00:09:37,439
We still have a lot
to talk about.

198
00:09:37,622 --> 00:09:39,384
You have too many questions.

199
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:44,649
Hey! Hey, you!
Where'd you go?

200
00:09:44,707 --> 00:09:46,123
We told you to
remain at the scene.

201
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:47,804
Look, I just got to go
check on my girlfriend.

202
00:09:47,861 --> 00:09:50,072
No, no, no. Come back here.
We need to talk to you.

203
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:52,964
What'd she take?

204
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,650
Look, I don't really know, okay?

205
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,548
You don't know what drugs
your girlfriend took?

206
00:09:56,618 --> 00:09:57,688
I'm not sure.

207
00:09:57,746 --> 00:09:59,045
Six kids OD'd last night.

208
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,971
And right now the parents of
those kids are getting visits

209
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:03,931
from police officers, telling
them that their kid is dead.

210
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:06,618
There was a guy
walking around with pills,

211
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,743
asking if anyone wanted Molly.

212
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:10,517
Next thing, kids were
dropping like flies.

213
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:12,441
A guy?
What did he look like?

214
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:13,673
It was so dark, I...

215
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:15,780
Give me a break, you didn't
get a name or a description?

216
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:18,298
- He uses the nickname "Ice."
- Uses?

217
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:21,056
- You know this guy?
- No.

218
00:10:21,994 --> 00:10:23,540
All right, let's
see some ID.

219
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,283
Look, you're not gonna tell
my mom about this, right?

220
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:29,697
Let me see some ID.

221
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:31,960
His appointment book

222
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,634
is full of clients
and court dates.

223
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:34,725
Yeah.

224
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:36,962
His last appointment
was at 5:00.

225
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,626
Hey, I already told you we're
not working the case, okay?

226
00:10:39,684 --> 00:10:42,048
We're gonna hand it off
to Homicide, so just stop.

227
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:44,506
- I know.
- Okay, then.

228
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:46,392
According to this,

229
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,493
Jack was meeting

230
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:48,970
a Dr. W. here.

231
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:50,079
Baez.

232
00:10:50,137 --> 00:10:51,517
Detectives.

233
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,939
Are you
Jack Boyle's assistant?

234
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:58,337
Maria Cuesta.
I'm Detective Baez.

235
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,048
Where were you
when Jack was attacked?

236
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:02,496
He sent me to court
to file a motion.

237
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:05,486
And who was this
Dr. W. at 5:00?

238
00:11:05,785 --> 00:11:07,151
Dr. Weber.

239
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:10,720
Hold on. You're talking
about the same Dr. Weber

240
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,353
that Jack represented
against Erin?

241
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,845
Yup.
How'd that meeting go?

242
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:18,201
He came to ask Mr. Boyle
to represent him.

243
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:19,501
Again?

244
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:21,118
In what case?

245
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:23,782
I don't know.
Because Mr. Boyle said

246
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,626
he would never
represent him on any case.

247
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:29,923
All right.
If we need anything else,

248
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,587
we'll let you know.

249
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:38,751
So where's this homicide
detective who caught the case?

250
00:11:39,523 --> 00:11:41,337
I guess you're looking at him.

251
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:09,251
Really, Jack?

252
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:11,598
Our wedding photo?

253
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,048
I need to remind you that
Nicky is graduating this year

254
00:12:28,106 --> 00:12:29,704
and you need to be there.

255
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:32,431
And when she gets married,

256
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,974
that's your job
to walk her down the aisle.

257
00:12:35,016 --> 00:12:36,515
You got that?

258
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:40,376
You've got to pull
through, Jack.

259
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:43,121
You owe that to her.

260
00:12:43,415 --> 00:12:45,618
You hear me?

261
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:47,927
Ms. Reagan?

262
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:49,103
We got the results back.

263
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:50,579
Your husband needs surgery.

264
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:52,650
Ex-h... Ex-husband.
Uh, when?

265
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:54,423
Immediately. He's got
internal bleeding,

266
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:55,970
a ruptured spleen.

267
00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:57,634
We're prepping
the O.R. right now.

268
00:12:57,692 --> 00:12:58,845
We'll need your consent.

269
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:01,181
W... My...
Uh, I don't understand.

270
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:03,393
You're the one listed
as his next of kin.

271
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,657
We need to do this ASAP

272
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:08,306
or he's not gonna make it.

273
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:11,759
I'll send in a nurse with the
consent forms for you to sign.

274
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:16,925
I remember the day
you got this.

275
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,516
First time I ever met
a sitting president.

276
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,790
- Had a lot of people cross this floor.
- Yeah.

277
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:23,946
Bill Clinton
was my personal favorite.

278
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:27,017
I want you both to know
I've secured positions for you

279
00:13:27,051 --> 00:13:28,259
within the department.

280
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:29,954
Sid, you'll be the new C.O.

281
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,251
of Manhattan North, and,
Baker...

282
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,165
this department can always use
a decorated detective.

283
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,460
I'd rather be here.
Me, too.

284
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:40,829
Well, you'll have to
take that up with my successor.

285
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,454
Chapter one, point ten
of the city charter:

286
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:46,454
"While so acting
temporarily as mayor,

287
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:48,828
"the public advocate
shall not exercise

288
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:52,462
"any power of appointment to
or removal from office

289
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,595
"or any power
lawfully delegated

290
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:55,919
by the mayor."

291
00:13:55,977 --> 00:13:57,643
She can't fire you.

292
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:00,751
I'm aware of that.

293
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:03,447
Are you kidding?
That's great.

294
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,941
Thing is...

295
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:08,106
my new boss wants me gone.

296
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,345
It doesn't matter
what she wants.

297
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:11,689
It's what <i>you</i> want.

298
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:14,126
You think I should
just barricade in here

299
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:16,752
because of some fine print
in the city charter?

300
00:14:17,118 --> 00:14:18,428
Boss, are you telling us

301
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:20,173
you got no more fight
left in you?

302
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:22,290
Oh, that's not gonna work, Sid.
What, you can't

303
00:14:22,348 --> 00:14:23,884
- take a challenge?
- And I'm not

304
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:27,176
ten years old and you are not
Sister Mary Damien

305
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,306
screaming at me
from the sidelines.

306
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:31,447
All right, you're your age now,
and you're the PC

307
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,580
and they're stringing up a noose
for one of your men.

308
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:34,655
- You're just gonna let them?
- Please.

309
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:36,733
- Shaming me's not gonna work, either.
- I would like

310
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,856
to say something.
As a woman.

311
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:40,720
That is the biggest
load of crap

312
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:41,928
that I have
ever heard.

313
00:14:42,022 --> 00:14:43,374
You're just gonna
let this broad

314
00:14:43,432 --> 00:14:44,470
push you out the door?

315
00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:47,048
This broad happens to be
mayor of New York City.

316
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:49,525
So what?
That's all you've got...

317
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:51,371
"I don't think
the mayor likes me"?!

318
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:54,121
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to here?!

319
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:11,472
I'm sorry to
keep you waiting.

320
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:14,745
- Lieutenant Simon Kinnear.
- Narcotics.

321
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:15,843
Please, have a seat.

322
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:17,538
This about the overdoses
at the party?

323
00:15:17,596 --> 00:15:19,410
Six kids died at that
party last night because

324
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:21,233
some punk drug dealer
decided to mix

325
00:15:21,377 --> 00:15:23,202
a lethal amount of
fentanyl in the capsules.

326
00:15:23,284 --> 00:15:24,569
What's that
got to do with us?

327
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:27,141
Well, when you responded to the
club, you got some information

328
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:29,273
from a kid whose girlfriend
went into arrest.

329
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:30,410
Ryan Young.

330
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:31,484
We flipped him.

331
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:32,759
He's willing to
make an introduction

332
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:35,812
to the drug dealer who sold the
drugs. Goes by the name of Ice.

333
00:15:36,164 --> 00:15:37,496
That's great.

334
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:40,800
Yeah. But he will
only work with you.

335
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,797
You interested?

336
00:15:43,663 --> 00:15:45,615
- To get a drug dealer off the streets?
- Hell yeah.

337
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:46,914
- Good.
- Have to make it look

338
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:48,258
a little less suspicious.

339
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:49,360
You need a girlfriend.

340
00:15:49,418 --> 00:15:51,236
Guess that's where
I come in?

341
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:52,910
I've always wanted
to be arm candy.

342
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:55,244
Now, we want you
to make a buy.

343
00:15:55,517 --> 00:15:58,181
Young... will meet you
inside the club

344
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:59,650
and introduce you

345
00:15:59,796 --> 00:16:02,056
to Bryce Medero,

346
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:04,072
aka Ice.

347
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:06,135
What happens
if we get into trouble?

348
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:07,591
If things get
out of hand,

349
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:10,963
you'll use an agreed-upon
safe word to alert us.

350
00:16:11,297 --> 00:16:13,297
How about
"get us the hell out of here"?

351
00:16:13,387 --> 00:16:15,987
Yeah, would that work?

352
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,541
Apparently Weber wanted
to retain Jack's services again.

353
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:22,032
You know what that was about?

354
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,369
After I lost the case
against Weber,

355
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:26,603
I took a magnifying glass
to his life.

356
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:29,217
Apparently... another one
of his girlfriends

357
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:30,694
disappeared five years ago.

358
00:16:30,752 --> 00:16:31,931
Body was never found.

359
00:16:31,998 --> 00:16:33,731
So I reopened that case.

360
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:36,322
And he wanted Jack
to represent him,

361
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:37,900
Jack said no.

362
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:40,595
Which may have set Weber off.

363
00:16:40,677 --> 00:16:43,681
All I know is Jack was anxious
to talk about something.

364
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:46,295
Does Weber have an alibi for
the day this girl disappeared?

365
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:49,345
He says he put her on a train to
Manhattan, never saw her again.

366
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:50,643
- Oh, my goodness.
- Without a body

367
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,931
it's hard to convict.

368
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:53,322
Well, what do you think?

369
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,720
Were you able to get a subpoena

370
00:16:54,785 --> 00:16:55,854
for his phone records
or something?

371
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:56,939
Based on what?

372
00:16:56,997 --> 00:16:58,190
Based on the fact
that he's already

373
00:16:58,247 --> 00:16:59,507
confessed to <i>one</i> murder.

374
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:01,150
That has no bearing
on this case.

375
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:02,595
Oh, come on.

376
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:05,041
Mom! Quick!

377
00:17:05,353 --> 00:17:07,119
What? What happened?

378
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:09,314
No, Dad's awake.

379
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:13,649
- Hi.
- Oh.

380
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,797
How you feeling?

381
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,924
Like I've gone through
a wood chipper.

382
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:23,845
Well, it proves you
got thick skin, Jack.

383
00:17:24,337 --> 00:17:25,914
Mom and Uncle Danny

384
00:17:25,972 --> 00:17:28,329
are the ones that found you
and got you to the hospital.

385
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:32,072
Did you get a look
at their face,

386
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,996
remember their voice, anything?

387
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,814
All I remember is someone...

388
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:41,150
h-hitting me in the head
from behind.

389
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:47,828
I love you, Dad.

390
00:17:47,978 --> 00:17:49,292
I'm so happy

391
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,017
you woke up.

392
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:13,010
Why don't you tell me
how you see the problem?

393
00:18:15,643 --> 00:18:17,009
You do realize

394
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:18,834
you're taking advice
from a murderer, right?

395
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:20,517
Might want to save
yourself some money

396
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:21,596
and save yourself, possibly,

397
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:23,955
by getting the hell out of here
as quick as you can.

398
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:25,502
Detective...

399
00:18:25,674 --> 00:18:26,940
I'm just saying.

400
00:18:27,036 --> 00:18:29,400
Is this absolutely necessary?
Well, I didn't want

401
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,814
to embarrass you in front
of your, uh, patient there.

402
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:35,517
Did you stab Jack Boyle?

403
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:37,603
What did you and Jack
fight about?

404
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:39,928
I-I would love to help you
but, unfortunately,

405
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,599
I think that's covered
under attorney-client privilege.

406
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:44,775
Where were you yesterday
at 11:00 a.m.?

407
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:48,120
Where were you May 28?

408
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,970
What did you just say?

409
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:54,244
Where were you May 28?

410
00:18:58,752 --> 00:19:00,506
Danny! Danny.

411
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:03,306
Walk away! Just walk away!

412
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:31,939
Are you sure you don't
want me to unpack that?

413
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:33,720
No, thank you.

414
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:37,676
Should I put it away, then?

415
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:40,095
It's fine where it is.

416
00:19:42,236 --> 00:19:43,902
May I ask what's in it?

417
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:50,881
The cash, the weapons,
the secret tapes.

418
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,072
Abigail...

419
00:19:55,914 --> 00:19:57,260
I'm tired.

420
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,609
The kind of tired
you can't sleep off.

421
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:06,828
Commissioner.

422
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,000
Officer Olivet
is here to see you.

423
00:20:13,817 --> 00:20:15,517
You knew about this?

424
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,306
Let's have him.

425
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:23,415
Kevin.

426
00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:28,585
Welcome to the 14th floor.

427
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:29,830
Commissioner.

428
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:32,314
It looks like it's a slow day
in the office.

429
00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:33,931
The gang's all here.
So why don't we

430
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:36,356
- move to the couch?
- .Please.

431
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:48,883
Well, I'd hoped
to be coming here

432
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:50,330
for a different reason.

433
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:52,728
I think I've got some idea

434
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:54,424
what you're going through,
and I'm sorry.

435
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,275
I saw the press conference.

436
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,559
Thank you for trying.

437
00:20:57,617 --> 00:21:00,942
This particular commissioner
sees that as part of his job.

438
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:03,620
To alienate the new mayor?

439
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:05,427
To stand up for his officers.

440
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:07,794
To be the voice of
its men and women.

441
00:21:09,153 --> 00:21:10,496
Listen, how you holding up?

442
00:21:10,554 --> 00:21:11,839
Considering the papers
are saying

443
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,131
that I killed
a defenseless woman,

444
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,587
that I'm a murderer?

445
00:21:14,684 --> 00:21:17,489
Well, you'd do well not to pay
any attention to the press.

446
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:19,280
Tell that to my
five-year-old.

447
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:22,591
When there's a police shooting,

448
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:25,325
the first 24 hours
are always a free-for-all.

449
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:27,513
But it's the PC's job
to be a real champion

450
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:28,894
for the guys in blue.

451
00:21:29,008 --> 00:21:30,794
Without that, there'd
be a lot more cops

452
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,747
dropping out of the department.

453
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:35,500
I'm walking the beat
with a target on my back.

454
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:37,099
The truth is gonna come out.

455
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:38,661
The press can be brutal,
for sure,

456
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:39,989
but that's what we're here for.

457
00:21:40,055 --> 00:21:41,552
To make sure you get your say.

458
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,255
To know that you've got someone
at the top watching your back.

459
00:21:44,372 --> 00:21:46,208
I'm resigning.

460
00:21:51,872 --> 00:21:53,653
Don't pull your pin.

461
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:55,544
Clear your name.

462
00:21:57,184 --> 00:21:58,293
And,

463
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:00,287
please, there's nothing
that you're gonna say

464
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:02,277
that's going to change my mind.

465
00:22:12,177 --> 00:22:13,282
<i>Your partner</i>

466
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,325
had to physically come
between you and Dr. Weber.

467
00:22:15,383 --> 00:22:18,005
Yeah, well, that's because the
guy is a cold-blooded killer

468
00:22:18,063 --> 00:22:19,474
- who's walking around free.
- Eh.

469
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:21,366
But that's not what set you off.

470
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,754
What set you off

471
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:24,972
was when he mentioned May 28.

472
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,119
- Hey. No.
- The day that...

473
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:27,539
No, I can't do this, okay?

474
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,048
You can't do what?
You can't talk about it?

475
00:22:29,105 --> 00:22:30,938
- I just said I can't!
- Can't what?!

476
00:22:35,844 --> 00:22:38,211
I can't do this without my wife.

477
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,509
Okay?

478
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:46,076
I think you can.

479
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,615
I know what it's like

480
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:55,332
to lose the love of your life.

481
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:58,365
I lost mine ten years ago.

482
00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:00,633
Well, what does that mean?

483
00:23:00,706 --> 00:23:03,982
That you're supposed to shed
some light on it for me?

484
00:23:04,756 --> 00:23:06,803
Teach me how to cope?

485
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:09,209
Unfortunately, I...

486
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:13,787
I don't have a...
a magic formula.

487
00:23:14,105 --> 00:23:15,537
I still miss her.

488
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:17,758
But I'm able
to live my life.

489
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,451
And that's what
everyone wants for you.

490
00:23:23,686 --> 00:23:26,178
Linda's death wasn't your fault.

491
00:23:30,818 --> 00:23:32,537
I know.

492
00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:34,912
So whose fault was it?

493
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,467
No one's.

494
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,412
Really?

495
00:23:39,695 --> 00:23:42,229
'Cause, see,
if I hadn't been working late

496
00:23:42,325 --> 00:23:45,154
and she hadn't changed her shift
because of me,

497
00:23:45,318 --> 00:23:46,505
because of my job...

498
00:23:46,563 --> 00:23:49,678
Just as she had done
a dozen times before that.

499
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,975
She was doing
her job.

500
00:23:52,123 --> 00:23:56,059
She died doing what she loved.

501
00:23:56,764 --> 00:23:58,740
What you would have done.

502
00:23:59,255 --> 00:24:00,678
I should've stopped her.

503
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,730
No, Danny, she...

504
00:24:02,968 --> 00:24:07,004
Danny, she died in a helicopter
crash airlifting her patient.

505
00:24:13,968 --> 00:24:16,748
I should've been home more, Doc.

506
00:24:17,898 --> 00:24:19,584
You know?

507
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:22,886
I wasn't.

508
00:24:23,311 --> 00:24:24,959
You've been coming
here for months,

509
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:28,092
and you have never uttered
the words that she's gone,

510
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:30,787
that she's dead,
she's never coming back.

511
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,607
It's not healthy,
Danny, and you know it.

512
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:35,232
What about Sean and Jack?

513
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:37,006
Hmm?

514
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:40,662
You want them to live in
anger and denial because...

515
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:44,133
because you can't get over it?

516
00:24:45,357 --> 00:24:47,920
I just don't know how.

517
00:24:49,646 --> 00:24:51,920
Very small steps.

518
00:24:53,342 --> 00:24:55,498
And if I can't?

519
00:24:57,311 --> 00:24:59,693
If you can't,
you lean on your family.

520
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:04,607
Linda's the one
I always lean on.

Hey, Jamie.

524
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:33,740
Remember Eddie?
Hey.

525
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,256
This is Bryce.

526
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:36,500
This is Jamie.
He's a friend of mine.

527
00:25:36,557 --> 00:25:37,656
He's cool.

528
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:39,389
Hey.
I've never seen you here.

529
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,631
I've never seen you either.

530
00:25:40,689 --> 00:25:42,389
He just wants to score
some Molly.

531
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:43,756
He looks like a cop.

532
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:46,004
That's funny. I was thinking
you look like a criminal.

533
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:47,303
Give him a toss.

534
00:25:47,598 --> 00:25:48,616
What?

00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:49,673
You have a problem with that?

536
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:50,975
I think we should
take our business

537
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:51,906
someplace else.

538
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:53,079
I think you're a little jumpy.

539
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:55,312
And I think you've seen

Hey, I thought you said
your guy was cool.

543
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:01,481
Chill out. How much
you looking to score?

544
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,113
Enough for a little party
for two.

545
00:26:03,216 --> 00:26:04,883
Oh, my God. Eddie?

546
00:26:05,504 --> 00:26:07,238
Ohhh, man. Long time.

547
00:26:07,592 --> 00:26:08,858
I-I-I'm busy right now.

548
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,594
God, I haven't seen you
since college. You look great.

549
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:12,596
Hey, who is this guy?

550
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:15,632
Listen, I'd-I'd love
to catch up.

551
00:26:15,634 --> 00:26:16,766
Maybe we can go and have

552
00:26:16,768 --> 00:26:18,368
a drink together.
Why don't you take a hike.

553
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,869
Yeah, this is
really not a good time.

554
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:20,937
Never is a good time.

555
00:26:20,939 --> 00:26:22,072
All right?

556
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:24,407
Doing business here or what?

557
00:26:25,243 --> 00:26:27,577
Yeah.

558
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:30,280
Four will cost you... $200.

559
00:26:36,588 --> 00:26:38,354
Enjoy.

560
00:26:38,356 --> 00:26:40,290
Oh, we will.

561
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:44,360
All right,
police. Nobody move!

562
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:45,962
Hands where we can see 'em!

563
00:26:57,576 --> 00:27:03,213
Autopsy showed cocaine
and amphetamines in the victim.

564
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:05,582
That's good news
for Olivet's defense.

565
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:07,283
Unfortunately, it
came after the media

566
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:09,219
had beaten him
up pretty good.

567
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:10,787
He resigned.

568
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:13,623
Oh, you didn't tell me
he resigned.

569
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:15,291
Collateral damage.

570
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:18,461
Things'll get better.

571
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:24,264
I'm on my third mayor, Pop.

572
00:27:24,322 --> 00:27:25,825
I think I'm used up.

573
00:27:26,362 --> 00:27:28,514
I don't think we need
two of us sitting here

574
00:27:28,693 --> 00:27:30,389
worrying about Danny.

575
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:32,061
Is he back yet?

576
00:27:32,124 --> 00:27:34,373
Came in the front door
and went straight upstairs.

577
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:36,615
No dinner,
no chitchat,

578
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:38,324
no nothing.

579
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:40,943
He should be down here
with his boys.

580
00:27:44,654 --> 00:27:46,404
Of all my kids,

581
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:49,002
I think he's the most like me.

582
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:53,178
When we lost Mary,
you checked out completely.

583
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:55,514
I was stuck in quicksand.

584
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:58,631
I remember.

585
00:28:00,272 --> 00:28:02,006
You know what got me out?

586
00:28:02,064 --> 00:28:03,193
Work?

587
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:05,074
Purpose?

588
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,599
My kids became my purpose.

589
00:28:23,906 --> 00:28:25,545
What are you doing?

590
00:28:25,756 --> 00:28:28,131
I got Judge Barton
to sign a subpoena

591
00:28:28,217 --> 00:28:29,936
for Weber's phone and computer.

592
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:31,201
Based on what?

593
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:32,669
Well, based on the fact
that Weber's

594
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:35,852
a person of interest in his
ex-girlfriend's disappearance.

595
00:28:36,004 --> 00:28:37,727
This was signed
at 2:00 a.m.

596
00:28:37,797 --> 00:28:40,789
Yeah. Judge Barton, you know,
he likes to play bridge

597
00:28:40,847 --> 00:28:42,172
until all hours of the night.

598
00:28:42,273 --> 00:28:45,408
Oh, and he also does have
a taste for good Scotch.

599
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:46,993
How much did that
set you back?

600
00:28:47,051 --> 00:28:48,141
You don't want to know.

601
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:49,422
So, what have you got?

602
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,414
Well, seems Weber didn't have
his cell phone turned on

603
00:28:52,516 --> 00:28:54,861
the morning Jack was stabbed, so
I couldn't track him that way.

604
00:28:54,918 --> 00:28:56,750
- But he does have a ZipPoint.
- A ZipPoint?

605
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:58,910
Yeah, it's to help you find
your car if it was stolen

606
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:00,401
or if you can't remember
where you parked.

607
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:02,039
Kind of like a mini GPS.

608
00:29:02,203 --> 00:29:04,797
The ZipPoint puts his vehicle
at the scene.

609
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:07,219
It's still not
enough to arrest.

610
00:29:07,277 --> 00:29:08,932
No, it's not enough to arrest,
but it is enough

611
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:10,788
to get a warrant
for Weber's house.

612
00:29:11,926 --> 00:29:14,664
Which is exactly what
we're gonna do.

613
00:29:17,462 --> 00:29:18,623
<i>Upstairs,</i>

614
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:19,993
downstairs, nothing.

615
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:21,782
We're just not looking
in the right places.

616
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,516
Or he didn't leave any evidence.

617
00:29:23,989 --> 00:29:25,588
Let's keep looking.

618
00:29:38,906 --> 00:29:40,938
Trap door? Are you kidding me?

619
00:29:51,383 --> 00:29:53,316
Okay.

620
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:57,045
Let's take a look.

621
00:30:08,203 --> 00:30:10,236
What do you think this is?

622
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:16,439
I think maybe he forgot
to take out the trash.

623
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:42,434
Hello.

624
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,868
Afternoon,
Commissioner.

625
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:46,178
The mayor said
you can go right in.

626
00:30:58,219 --> 00:31:00,469
Commissioner Reagan,
thank you for coming.

627
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:01,660
"Frank" will do fine.

628
00:31:01,718 --> 00:31:03,217
Close the door, have a seat.

629
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,922
I read the autopsy report.

630
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,647
- Mm.
- She was

631
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:21,118
clearly under the influence.

632
00:31:21,328 --> 00:31:22,738
To put it mildly.

633
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:24,062
Well, how would you put it?

634
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,321
Officer Olivet was trying
to reason with someone

635
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:29,055
who had snorted enough jet fuel

636
00:31:29,113 --> 00:31:31,321
to win the ninth race
at Belmont.

637
00:31:31,718 --> 00:31:34,052
I'm not going to pressure
the DA's office

638
00:31:34,195 --> 00:31:37,078
to pursue any criminal charges

639
00:31:37,135 --> 00:31:39,274
against Officer Olivet.

640
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,024
There's something
you should know

641
00:31:45,082 --> 00:31:46,391
about police officers.

642
00:31:46,469 --> 00:31:48,750
- Oh, I think I know...
- Hold on.

643
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,256
Okay.

644
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:55,142
They know what people
are capable of

645
00:31:55,231 --> 00:31:58,195
in ways that most,
thankfully, do not.

646
00:31:58,682 --> 00:32:01,547
They have seen firsthand
the cigarette burns

647
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,930
on an infant's back
or the black eyes

648
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:05,938
and the sideways jaw

649
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:08,735
on an 80-year-old
rape victim.

650
00:32:09,351 --> 00:32:11,664
And they assume the worst.

651
00:32:12,387 --> 00:32:14,654
And they take that on

652
00:32:14,914 --> 00:32:18,182
so that good people
can go about their lives

653
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,211
and think generously
about their fellow man.

654
00:32:22,044 --> 00:32:24,422
They provide that luxury.

655
00:32:26,326 --> 00:32:28,539
You say that as if it's a fact.

656
00:32:28,771 --> 00:32:30,891
It is to me.

657
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:32,993
And a hard-earned one.

658
00:32:33,361 --> 00:32:36,727
And whoever is in my office,
he or she,

659
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:39,006
if they're any good,
is gonna feel the same way.

660
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:42,969
My job is to advocate
for the people.

661
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:47,050
And if that calls
for an investigation

662
00:32:47,108 --> 00:32:50,875
into your department
or any of your officers,

663
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:53,774
it's not personal.
It's going to happen.

664
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:56,766
Because of your rush
to judgment,

665
00:32:56,878 --> 00:32:59,746
this city has lost
a good police officer

666
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:01,672
as surely and as finally

667
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:04,047
as if he were killed
in the line of duty.

668
00:33:04,105 --> 00:33:06,219
I didn't ask you here to argue

669
00:33:06,345 --> 00:33:09,279
the-the finer points
of the shooting.

670
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:13,908
I called you in here
to apologize.

671
00:33:17,431 --> 00:33:20,102
As it turns out,
I can't fire you.

672
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:23,164
Really?

673
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:25,961
I didn't know that.

674
00:33:29,203 --> 00:33:32,155
I guess I could just resign.

675
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:34,938
Your polling numbers are higher

676
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,750
than any mayor's in memory.

677
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:41,774
Oh, don't pay any attention
to those.

678
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:44,211
Why do you say that?

679
00:33:44,377 --> 00:33:48,413
They don't poll the folks
who we put behind bars.

680
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:53,594
But I'm kind of like one of
those last century buildings

681
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:56,735
you fought to save when you were
on the landmark commission.

682
00:33:56,965 --> 00:33:58,464
How's that?

683
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:00,930
Oh, people walk by me every day

684
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:05,086
and I look like an anachronism
against all the glass and steel,

685
00:34:05,702 --> 00:34:07,187
but tear me down...

686
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:10,094
all of a sudden, I'm beloved.

687
00:34:15,128 --> 00:34:17,762
That's it? We're done?

688
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,344
I am.

689
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:25,055
Do you want to stay on the job?

690
00:34:27,047 --> 00:34:28,891
Only if I'm wanted.

691
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,138
Madam Mayor.

692
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:33,752
Good day.

693
00:34:34,774 --> 00:34:36,391
Maggie.

694
00:34:40,776 --> 00:34:42,438
Maggie.

695
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:52,164
You found our body.

696
00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:54,000
Yep. Crime scene has it.

697
00:34:54,155 --> 00:34:55,758
You'll be able
to put him away.

698
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:57,863
Thank you.

699
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:00,515
How is Jack?

700
00:35:00,758 --> 00:35:02,743
He's gonna make it.

701
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,828
Somehow I feel guilty
about that.

702
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:09,024
- Don't.
- You were right.

703
00:35:09,082 --> 00:35:11,849
I asked you to work this case
so you were too busy

704
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:13,672
to even think about Linda.

705
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,024
Yeah.

706
00:35:16,172 --> 00:35:18,453
Wasn't too hard to figure
that one out.

707
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:23,524
Trouble is, all I do
is think about Linda, anyway.

708
00:35:23,618 --> 00:35:24,907
Maybe you should
think about

709
00:35:24,965 --> 00:35:27,727
what Linda would say if you told
her you were gonna quit.

710
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:29,914
I know what she'd say.

711
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:31,961
She'd be ecstatic.

712
00:35:32,145 --> 00:35:34,547
No, she wouldn't.

713
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,317
You would have
driven her insane at home.

714
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:39,316
What are you gonna do?

715
00:35:39,374 --> 00:35:41,735
You suck at fishing,
you hate golf.

716
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:44,485
What you're good at is the job.

717
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:47,321
The job doesn't need me anymore.

718
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:50,609
Well, maybe you need the job.

719
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,321
Will you just think about it?

720
00:35:58,927 --> 00:36:00,407
Yeah.

721
00:36:00,918 --> 00:36:05,141
And if you ever need
a shoulder to cry on...

722
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:07,353
Call Jamie?

723
00:36:08,485 --> 00:36:10,407
Exactly.

724
00:36:31,446 --> 00:36:33,253
Come on, Danny.
Just take a minute, man.

725
00:36:33,311 --> 00:36:35,485
No. You said you were
gonna drop me off.

726
00:36:35,543 --> 00:36:36,883
It's one little stop.

727
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:38,610
Yeah, well, I don't feel
like socializing.

728
00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:40,766
Come on. It's Pop's friend,
Mrs. Ginty, all right?

729
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,725
She hasn't seen us since
we were kids. I promised.

730
00:36:42,782 --> 00:36:44,571
Great. Then we'll send her
a picture.

731
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:47,134
Get out of the car now.

732
00:37:05,759 --> 00:37:07,328
Surprise!

733
00:37:07,414 --> 00:37:08,781
Hey.

734
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:09,953
Hey.

735
00:37:10,011 --> 00:37:11,177
What's going on?

736
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:12,884
- Wait till you see the game room.
- The what?

737
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:14,860
It's not a game room,
it's a man cave.

738
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:17,110
- What is this?
- This is your new home.

739
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:19,618
Only a five-minute
walk from school.

740
00:37:19,676 --> 00:37:20,821
We rented it for you.

741
00:37:20,879 --> 00:37:22,258
With an option to buy

742
00:37:22,316 --> 00:37:24,243
if you decide
you like living here.

743
00:37:24,602 --> 00:37:26,039
There's even a real backyard.

744
00:37:26,097 --> 00:37:28,032
- Come on, let's eat.
- I'm starving.

745
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,644
We'll give you
the full tour after.

746
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,702
Danny.

747
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,235
Everything you need's
right here.

748
00:38:22,196 --> 00:38:24,296
Why are y'all looking at me?

749
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:30,562
I don't know what to say.

750
00:38:38,547 --> 00:38:40,125
Okay.

751
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:44,797
I did read an obit a while back.

752
00:38:44,943 --> 00:38:48,211
When you reach a certain age,
you do that sort of thing.

753
00:38:49,731 --> 00:38:51,798
And someone said,

754
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:55,445
"We are all just passing time.

755
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,375
And occupy our chair
very briefly."

756
00:39:03,146 --> 00:39:07,234
The time we had with Linda
was a gift.

757
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,789
And we are all the better

758
00:39:11,563 --> 00:39:14,344
that she occupied her chair...

759
00:39:15,212 --> 00:39:17,523
so well.

760
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,156
Some say

761
00:39:24,016 --> 00:39:26,898
we have more than
our share of loss.

762
00:39:28,306 --> 00:39:32,108
But I see God's light
in this family every day.

763
00:39:32,383 --> 00:39:34,711
And though I may not
understand it,

764
00:39:34,904 --> 00:39:37,781
I trust in His plan for us all.

765
00:39:42,775 --> 00:39:45,309
When Mary died...

766
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:49,617
When I lost my wife...

767
00:39:50,752 --> 00:39:52,633
I was a mess.

768
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:55,461
And it was my kids...

769
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:58,136
Joe, Erin,

770
00:39:58,445 --> 00:39:59,828
Jamie,

771
00:40:00,021 --> 00:40:03,956
and Danny, who...

772
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:07,531
even though they
had lost their mom...

773
00:40:09,688 --> 00:40:12,992
always made sure,
each in their own way,

774
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:15,938
to be there for me.

775
00:40:18,422 --> 00:40:19,690
I'm not sure

776
00:40:19,748 --> 00:40:22,082
what a shrink would say
about that.

777
00:40:24,344 --> 00:40:26,925
But it was appreciated.

778
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:43,328
Boys, I'd like you to say grace.

779
00:40:43,765 --> 00:40:47,289
Actually, um,
I'd like to say it.

780
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,266
Bless us, oh, Lord.

781
00:40:59,495 --> 00:41:01,161
These Thy gifts,

782
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:04,133
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty,

783
00:41:04,257 --> 00:41:05,975
through Christ our Lord.

784
00:41:06,156 --> 00:41:07,180
Amen.

785
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:08,567
Amen.

786
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:10,784
Amen.

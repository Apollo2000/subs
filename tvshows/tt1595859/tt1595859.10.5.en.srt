1
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:22,326
Good to be back?

2
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,067
Almost like the old days?

3
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:26,504
Right? Remember
that spot uptown?

4
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:36,384
No! No! No, no!

5
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:37,515
Stay with me!

6
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,083
Allen, please! No!

7
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:43,565
No! No, no, no, no!

8
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:58,667
What do we got?Drive-by shooting.

9
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,364
Witnesses said it looks
like tonight's headliner,

10
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:02,366
Cameron Gooding,
was the intended target,

11
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,628
but his driver
got hit instead.

12
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:04,847
Cameron Gooding?

13
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,197
Cameron Gooding?

14
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:10,331
You two?

15
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:12,811
What, you're the only two
detectives in all of New York?

16
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:14,639
Right place,
right time.

17
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:16,424
Unlike your driver,
apparently.

18
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:17,816
My friend.

19
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,122
You sure
he wasn't the target?

20
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,384
No way.

21
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:21,994
He was always the good guy.

22
00:01:22,038 --> 00:01:24,345
Always got us home
at the end of every night.

23
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:27,913
No, them bullets
were for me.

24
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:29,393
Any idea who would
want you dead?

25
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:30,916
Could be anyone.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,180
Maybe it was Playa Boy Shine.

27
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:36,357
He called Playa Boy Shine out

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,662
on his most recent album.

29
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:40,012
We made amends.

30
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:42,102
What about after your scandal
broke? Any threats then?

31
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:43,407
Some.

32
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:45,844
Maybe you might want
to stop playing coy with us

33
00:01:45,888 --> 00:01:48,282
so we can figure out
who the hell it was

34
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:49,892
that killed
your supposed friend.

35
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:51,328
Don't you say another word!Well, maybe

36
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:53,417
you should say a word
and stop holding out!

37
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:55,680
Allen was a good guy!
He didn't deserve this!

38
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,509
It's all my fault.

39
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,035
That should be me!

40
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:06,778
That should be me.

41
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,305
Thank you again for agreeing

42
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:12,697
to be a part
of our panel.

43
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:15,309
Of course. Any time.

44
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:18,355
A.D.A. Reagan, do
you have a minute?

45
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,836
Sure. You have
some more policy suggestions

46
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,230
you want me to pass on
to the D.A.?

47
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:25,188
Sorry. I know I can
be a little...

48
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:26,407
Outspoken?

49
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,148
No worries.

50
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:31,412
You remind me a lot of myself
when I used to go here.

51
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:33,501
Ramona Lewis.

52
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:35,416
Nice to meet you.Likewise.

53
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:36,982
Yeah, I studied a
lot of your cases.

54
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:39,202
Your career at the D.A.'s office
is something I aspire to.

55
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:41,857
Well, we should talk about
you coming in for an interview.

56
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,599
Actually, I had a
different kind of favor.

57
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,994
My best friend was murdered
a couple months ago.

58
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:51,606
I'm sorry. Here in New York?

59
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:55,305
She got involved with this cult
led by this guy Daniel Shapiro.

60
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,394
And she killed herself
shortly after.

61
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:59,614
I thought you said
she was murdered.

62
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:00,919
Might as well have been.

63
00:03:00,963 --> 00:03:02,443
Shapiro convinced her
to take her own life.

64
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:05,010
And your office tried to
charge him with manslaughter.

65
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:06,534
Tried and failed.

66
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:08,318
Well, if it's already
been investigated,

67
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:10,277
there's not much
I can do to help.

68
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,583
Then who knows how many
more lives he's gonna ruin.

69
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:18,067
Please, A.D.A. Reagan,
just review the case.

70
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,156
Her name was Yelena Page.

71
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,291
I'll look into it.

72
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:26,336
No promises.

73
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:33,213
Sergeant?Boss.

74
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:34,562
How's the apartment?

75
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:36,477
Feels more like home
every day, sir, thank you.

76
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,043
Good. Means a lot.

77
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:40,132
I wanted to talk to you
about a rookie

78
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:42,570
I assigned to your squad
last week-- Sarah Brooks.

79
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:44,049
Yeah, came in with a
chip on her shoulder,

80
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,442
but we'll make a
good cop of her yet.

81
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:47,009
I don't doubt it.

82
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:49,316
Um, I see she's already earned
herself a command discipline.

83
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,622
Yeah, I visited her on post
to scratch her memo book,

84
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,190
but she said she'd
forgotten it in her locker.

85
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,540
Little harsh, isn't it?

86
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:59,326
Attention to detail
is the heart of good policing.

87
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:00,762
Don't start with the
platitudes, Reagan.

88
00:04:00,805 --> 00:04:02,633
It was her first
week on patrol.

89
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:03,852
I'm a little confused, boss.

90
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:05,201
You've always wanted me
to run a tight ship.

91
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,812
Yes, but there is such a
thing as too firm a hand.

92
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:10,554
Don't see how this was too firm.
It's all by the book.

93
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,643
I wanted your side,
and I have it,

94
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,689
but I'm ripping up the rip.

95
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:19,911
End police violence now!

96
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,478
All right, folks,
let's give them some space.

97
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:23,480
Guys, I'm just trying
to get my kids to school.

98
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:25,265
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Get McKenzie off the force!

99
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:26,440
Please, let us get through.

100
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:27,702
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Daddy!

101
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:29,704
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

102
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:30,835
Guys, please, please!

103
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,316
Racist cops!All right, all right.

104
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,622
Daddy!

105
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:36,624
Leave my kids alone!

106
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:39,453
End police violence now!
End police violence now!

107
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:40,715
End police violence now!

108
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:44,109
End police violence now!
End police vi...

109
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,851
It's been like this
since yesterday.

110
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:48,940
This ain't right.

111
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,555
Someone found
his home address.

112
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:55,860
What's patrol doing?

113
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:58,167
Everything they can,
which isn't a lot.

114
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,647
And what's that mean?

115
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,952
Means you can't
use much force

116
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:03,520
defending a cop accused
of excessive force.

117
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:05,522
Operative word... "accused."

118
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,350
Which used to
mean something.

119
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:09,396
"Accused" has been
replaced with "convicted"

120
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,354
down in ye olde
public square.

121
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:14,618
What happened? Did you eat
your Wheaties this morning?

122
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:16,707
I just think that things have
gotten out of hand.

123
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:18,579
Thank you.

124
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:19,884
Welcome to our world.

125
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,364
Pardon me, Sid,
but I'm usually

126
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:22,844
the voice of reason
in your world.

127
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:24,846
But when IAB,
the Bronx D.A.

128
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:26,761
and the Civilian
Complaint Review Board

129
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:29,111
all find no evidence
of criminality

130
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:30,939
on Detective McKenzie's part...

131
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:32,244
The potato keeps getting passed

132
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:33,768
until they find someone
who will.

133
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:35,291
And they've done
exactly that.

134
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,772
NYPD Administrative Judge
John Bradshaw informs us...

135
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:41,950
His ruling on the McKenzie case.

136
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:43,952
But that's good, right?
He's our guy.

137
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:45,214
He says

138
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:46,607
McKenzie's actions may have

139
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,652
violated department guidelines.

140
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:49,827
Why the hell
would he say that?

141
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:52,613
One doesn't always make
one's bones

142
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:55,311
by going along
with the establishment.

143
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,140
People tend to change
when the spotlight's on them,

144
00:05:58,183 --> 00:05:59,794
and he just grabbed it.

145
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,970
You think

146
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:04,233
our own guy
would hammer McKenzie?

147
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:08,498
If our own guy
is now maybe his own guy.

148
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,544
Yeah.

149
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:41,662
A.D.A. Flynn really dropped
the ball on this Shapiro case.

150
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:43,968
- What'd you find?
- A real botch job.

151
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:46,797
It's like he opened the
milk, took one bad whiff,

152
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:48,190
put it back in the fridge.

153
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,627
Guess it's a good thing
he's no longer with us.

154
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:52,890
I'll say. He missed allegations
of a pyramid scheme,

155
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:55,458
dropped domestic
violence complaints,

156
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:58,113
missing persons reports
from worried parents.

157
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:00,942
You're saying Shapiro's
been kidnapping these girls?

158
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:03,901
They usually turn up a couple of
weeks later, refusing to talk.

159
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,903
I mean, it's all
very spooky.

160
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:08,210
You speak to anyone
in his cult?

161
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:10,386
Yeah, I-I poked around their
little co-op in Brooklyn,

162
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,997
but they clammed up
when they realized who I was.

163
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:15,522
You know, Ramona was right.

164
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:17,045
We really failed her friend.

165
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:18,699
Want to go after this guy?

166
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:20,831
Yeah. But we're gonna need

167
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,833
to get someone
in his circle to talk.

168
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:27,316
I think I got just the
person for the job.

169
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,504
Go.

170
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:48,424
Expecting that 49 later today,
Sergeant.

171
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,730
Yes, sir, I'll get
it right to you.

172
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,083
There a question
go with that look?

173
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:57,477
No, sir.

174
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,088
Good.

175
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:10,664
What's up?

176
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:12,666
We're looking for Pia Toledo.
That's what's up.

177
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:13,797
Who's looking?

178
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:15,712
Well, I'm Mister Rogers,

179
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:16,974
and this is my neighborhood,

180
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:18,541
so answer
the question.

181
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:19,586
Where's Pia Toledo?

182
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,550
- Pia Toledo?
- Who the hell are you?

183
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:30,205
I'm Detectives Reagan.
This is Detective Baez.

184
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:32,337
And you can wait outside.

185
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:38,213
What's with the muscle?

186
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:40,258
You worried about
some sort of retribution?

187
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:42,217
I don't know about that shooting
if that's why you're here.

188
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,654
Gooding allegedly assaulted you.

189
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:46,830
And from what we heard,
your career pretty much ended

190
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:48,223
after the scandal broke.

191
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:50,442
Yeah, I got blacklisted.

192
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:52,880
Labeled as one of those girls
sleeps her way to the top.

193
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:54,577
Nice world we live in?

194
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,797
But that doesn't mean
I tried to kill him.

195
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,494
We went through his phone
and found

196
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,670
you'd sent him a slew
of threats-- death threats.

197
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:03,630
You've never heard of hyperbole?
A rapper's bread and butter?

198
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:06,720
Okay. Where were you
two nights ago at 11:30 p.m.?

199
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,765
Asleep... in this room.

200
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:11,115
And is there anyone
who can verify that for you?

201
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,595
Wouldn't you like to know.

202
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,728
The hotel's got
cameras, don't they?

203
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:16,730
Yeah, and we plan
on taking a look at them.

204
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,209
In the meantime, you worked

205
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:20,734
with Dead Dove Records
for a long time.

206
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,692
Can you think of anyone else
in Cameron Gooding's universe

207
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:23,998
who might want to see him dead?

208
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,216
Most of those players left.

209
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,696
Why is that?

210
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,655
After his business partner
went to prison,

211
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:30,787
Gooding ran Dead Dove Records
right into the ground.

212
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:33,224
You're saying
the record label is broke?

213
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:34,748
Yep, and so is he.

214
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:38,447
Word is, he owes all
sorts of unsavory types.

215
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,796
- Like who?
- I don't know.

216
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,669
But I'm telling you,
the king is dead.

217
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,759
Figuratively speaking.

218
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:50,590
I know you've been
undercover before,

219
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,113
but this ain't
a one-time op.

220
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:53,593
We want you to go deep.

221
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:54,681
I'm ready.

222
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:56,639
Are you? I mean,
you're ready to adapt,

223
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:58,119
to improvise,

224
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:00,164
to stay in character even
if there's a gun to your head?

225
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,905
- Well, I think so.
- You see...

226
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:04,125
if you hesitate like that,
you'll be made in a second.

227
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:06,823
Lucky for you,
you got me to teach you.

228
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,695
They used to call me
"the Chameleon."

229
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,090
This is Ramona Lewis.

230
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:16,398
She brought the case to Erin,
and Yelena Page,

231
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,400
her best friend
who offed herself,

232
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:21,708
thanks to this guy--
Daniel Shapiro, the ringleader.

233
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:24,798
He runs a supposed
wellness group

234
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:26,800
based upstate and in Brooklyn.

235
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:29,672
We've identified a girl
we think is a weak link.

236
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:33,371
We'd like you to go undercover
and get her to open up.

237
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:35,286
Is Shapiro dangerous?

238
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,767
We think so. There's been,
several disappearances

239
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:38,899
around him.

240
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:41,162
Evidence suggests
he maintains control

241
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:44,165
over these girls through
violence and sexual coercion.

242
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,733
Gifts that he may very well try
to share with you.

243
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,822
Still think you're up to this?

244
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,433
I'm ready.

245
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:58,832
We noticed you...

246
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,095
One second.

247
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:03,053
Do you mind?

248
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:06,404
As I was saying,

249
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:08,755
we noticed you haven't canceled
any of your tour dates yet.

250
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:09,843
Why not?

251
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,366
I'm not about to
be intimidated.

252
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:12,715
Or maybe you're just
so strapped for cash,

253
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,499
you can't afford
to take a day off?

254
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:16,318
- What are you talking about?
- Dead Dove's...

255
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:17,764
headphone line tanked.

256
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:20,114
You've had a mass exodus
of young artists.

257
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:23,291
And your penthouse is listed for
half the normal asking price.

258
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:24,553
And this just, coincidentally,

259
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:26,729
happens to be
your first tour since '09.

260
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:27,861
- So what?
- You're keeping...

261
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:29,645
the label afloat out
of your pocket,

262
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,516
and you're about to go down
with the ship.

263
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,475
It's nothing I can't handle
with a little bit of hustle.

264
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:34,563
Hustle?

265
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:35,956
Like you used to do
on the street?

266
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,435
What's that supposed to mean?You know,

267
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,786
like you did in your past life,
before you were a star.

268
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:40,787
The stuff you rap about.

269
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,397
Guns, drugs, money.

270
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,051
So you think I'm dealing?

271
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,574
Come on. Give me a break.

272
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:48,577
- Maybe dealing with the dealers.
- No.

273
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,665
Well, we know
about the large

274
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,927
sums of cash
you've been depositing.

275
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:52,450
I sold a couple of my cars.

276
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:53,800
So what, okay?

277
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:54,757
Now I got to get back to work.

278
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:55,802
Look,

279
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:57,673
how many of your friends
got to die

280
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,153
before you come clean with us?

281
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:04,767
Or maybe you really didn't care
that much about Allen after all.

282
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:07,291
We're trying to help you here.

283
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:09,250
Just tell us who you owe.

284
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:15,865
Guy that runs the block
that I came up on.

285
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,127
Damien Ross.

286
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,477
But I can swear to you,
he wouldn't do this.

287
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:21,392
And I can swear to you,
we probably have

288
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:23,960
a few outstanding warrants
on this Damien Ross.

289
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,015
Hey.

290
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,843
Hey.

291
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:38,279
Mind if I join you?

292
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,370
Everything good at home?

293
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:45,808
Well, aside from her working
nights and me days, yeah.

294
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:48,855
My.

295
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,772
Run something past you, Dad?

296
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,643
Shoot.

297
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:58,299
Say you had
a higher-up

298
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:01,911
who you thought was maybe
using his position to...

299
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:03,783
get over with a rookie.

300
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,741
An attractive female rookie?

301
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,221
Yeah. And you get
the strong impression

302
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:09,266
that he expected you
to look the other way.

303
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,574
Espinoza never struck
me as the type.

304
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:15,142
Didn't say it was him.

305
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:17,971
No, you didn't.

306
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:21,626
Our apartment,
Espinoza was the one

307
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,106
who signed the lease over to us.

308
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,716
Said no strings attached.

309
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,848
And now you're feeling strings.

310
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:26,849
The last couple days,

311
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,372
he tore up a rip
that I gave her,

312
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,679
and I saw the two of 'em
come into work in the morning.

313
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,072
Together.

314
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:33,813
In his car.

315
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,989
Well, no crime in that.

316
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,034
No.

317
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,037
But something's off.

318
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:44,040
And on account of the
apartment, you owe him one.

319
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:45,868
Guy's been nothing
but good to me.

320
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,653
But if he's using his authority
to seduce a young cop,

321
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:50,873
I can't just look the other way.

322
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,657
Right?

323
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:57,662
Not in this day and age.

324
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:59,403
On the other hand...

325
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:04,191
It's just us here, Dad.

326
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:06,889
Well,

327
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:10,937
it was me who asked IAB to
investigate Detective McKenzie.

328
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,026
I mean, there were
legit complaints.

329
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:14,375
He wasn't spotless.

330
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:17,944
But absolutely no evidence
of excessive force.

331
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:19,380
Doesn't seem to matter.

332
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:20,947
The way the public's
gone after him,

333
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,731
you'd think he killed somebody.

334
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,298
Yeah, tell me about it.

335
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:27,910
And now a judge is inserting
himself in the process.

336
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,651
Why?

337
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:32,219
He's one of our own.
You tell me.

338
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:34,395
Either to make a name
for himself

339
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:36,614
or to clear the detective
once and for all.

340
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,094
Yeah, but even if he clears him,

341
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:40,401
you think the crowds
chanting "racist" are gonna stop

342
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:44,840
because a cop says
a fellow cop isn't one?

343
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,929
So there is
no "once and for all"?

344
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:49,889
No. The outcome of
the investigation won't matter.

345
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,892
Once it started,
he was tried, convicted

346
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:57,070
and executed
in the court of public opinion.

347
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:01,030
Think I should skip IAB?

348
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:09,082
If you ask for Espinoza
to be investigated and it leaks,

349
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,085
as it may,

350
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:15,871
it won't matter
if IAB turns up nothing.

351
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:31,495
Take those beads off.
You look like Miss Cleo.

352
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:32,627
Wait, don't they wear
this kind of stuff?

353
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,628
Too on the nose.

354
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:34,846
Lose 'em.

355
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,457
Good.

356
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,372
Now, you remember
your U.C. name?

357
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:41,766
Jess Maitland,
transplant of Wisconsin.

358
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,072
Father went to jail.

359
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:45,509
Ran away from
my domineering mother, which,

360
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:47,468
by the way,
a little close to home.

361
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:48,991
Lends you authenticity.

362
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,384
Plus, it'll help you
stay in character

363
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:51,994
if there's a gun to your head.

364
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,561
Gee, thanks.

365
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:54,562
Establish trust first,

366
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:55,998
then ask about Shapiro.

367
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,130
Got it.

368
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,609
But don't be too direct.

369
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:00,524
Okay.But don't be too shy,
either. Be personable.

370
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:03,049
You seem more nervous than I am.

371
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:05,616
Well, you bet I'm nervous.
I'm not about to have a Reagan

372
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,401
get made and killed
on my watch.

373
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:09,403
These girls, they seem harmless.

374
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:10,578
Ever hear of Charles Manson?

375
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:12,058
More or less.Yeah, well,

376
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:14,147
he had a bunch of brainwashed
girls around him, too.

377
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,975
And they murdered for sport.

378
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,454
Right.

379
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:20,196
If something goes wrong,

380
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,068
it's just you out there.

381
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:24,635
I hope you're as ready
as you think you are.

382
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,072
I am.

383
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:30,990
Go get 'em.

384
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:52,315
I'm sorry.

385
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:54,491
could you help me?

386
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:55,927
I'm kind of new to all this.

387
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,581
Of course, dear.

388
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,279
What are you looking for?

389
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:02,673
Well, I was told that
the-the crystals have certain,

390
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:04,675
um, properties.

391
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:07,635
Amethyst is good for
psychic practitioners.

392
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:11,595
Malachite to connect
to the heart chakra.

393
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:13,597
Moonstone...

394
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,687
for healing a bad romance.

395
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:19,516
Depends on what
you're looking for.

396
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,170
I'm not sure, exactly.

397
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:25,174
You seem a little nervous.

398
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,482
I am, kinda.

399
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:31,093
It's okay, dear.
This is a safe space.

400
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:31,876
Ruby.

401
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,139
Jess. Nice to meet you.

402
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:34,270
Are you new in town?

403
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:36,229
That obvious?

404
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:37,665
I came...

405
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,493
I came here for a fresh start.

406
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:40,929
Let me guess.

407
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:43,453
Boyfriend?

408
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:47,153
No.

409
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:50,634
It's family issues, isn't it?

410
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:52,114
Family.

411
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:54,551
A deeper pain.

412
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:56,466
I could tell...

413
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,207
by your energy.

414
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:01,602
Hey, do you think you could help me?

415
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:05,519
You didn't come here
for the crystals, did you?

416
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:09,044
You came because you heard
that we help people like you.

417
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,263
I hope so.

418
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:13,962
A lot of people come here
with a bad past.

419
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:15,268
We take them in,

420
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:18,358
give 'em the community
they were always missing.

421
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:19,533
Heal old wounds.

422
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,274
That sounds nice.

423
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:24,625
We're having
a small gathering tomorrow.

424
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,714
Be my plus-one.

425
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:29,673
I don't know.

426
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:32,111
I promise you,

427
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,330
it will be worth it.

428
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:36,680
Okay.

429
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:42,991
Damien Ross.

430
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:45,167
Outstanding warrants
for drug possession,

431
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:47,865
weapons possession
and felony assault.

432
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:49,954
How'd you know where to find me?

433
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:50,955
Little birdie told us.

434
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,479
Yeah, well,
that birdie's dead.

435
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:53,915
Well, it won't be by your hand.

436
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,743
Like my partner said,
we got a whole buffet

437
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:56,744
of charges against you.

438
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:57,788
Don't care.

439
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:58,876
So many, it's
hard to know

440
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,487
which to dig into first.

441
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,792
Still don't care.

442
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:04,708
Well, how about if we
put murder on the table?

443
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:06,188
Care now?

444
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:07,668
Lawyer.

445
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,670
I hate this dialect of perp.

446
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:11,628
Gives me such a headache.

447
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:14,457
Yeah. Translates
to "give me the max sentence."

448
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:15,458
Look, I ain't saying anything
without one.

449
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:16,546
I heard you
the first time.

450
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,288
But, just between us,
what was it?

451
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:22,291
Did you get tired of waiting
for Cameron to pay you back?

452
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:24,946
You wanted to reacquaint
him with street justice?

453
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:28,776
I guess you're right.
Let's go talk to the D.A.

454
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:31,518
Look, look. Wait. You-you think
I tried to off Gooding?

455
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:34,129
That sound like English to you?

456
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,391
Couldn't be.

457
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:37,654
Why would I try to kill Gooding?

458
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:39,395
He speaks English,

459
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,658
but he doesn't
understand English.

460
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:44,270
You tried to kill Gooding

461
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:45,706
because he owes you money.
That's why.

462
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:49,100
Exactly why I'd want him alive.

463
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:52,103
Fame and talent like that,
he's the surest bet I ever made.

464
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:54,105
Then why you sending muscle
to his place?

465
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:56,760
I call it
protecting our investment.

466
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:58,284
Or intimidation?

467
00:19:58,327 --> 00:19:59,981
Look, I swear.

468
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:01,635
We worship Gooding
on the corner.

469
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:02,766
I'd never take a shot at him.

470
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,898
Someone did.

471
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:05,334
Well, it wasn't me.

472
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:07,945
If I took him out,
it'd be me the next day.

473
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:09,599
And if I knew who tried this,

474
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:11,427
you can bet they wouldn't be
around no more, neither.

475
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:16,040
Look, that's the truth,
Detectives.

476
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:29,358
Judge ruled
on Detective McKenzie.

477
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:30,751
He's recommending termination.

478
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,930
The judge just made his bones.

479
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:37,279
Recommending to who?

480
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:38,280
Him.

481
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:41,283
I get the potato.

482
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:42,719
Well, what's he basing it on?

483
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:44,460
"The preponderance of credible evidence."

484
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:46,245
Evidence which no one else
seemed to think

485
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:47,463
merited a suspension.

486
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,596
I'm not gonna ask.Ask what?

487
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:50,771
What he's gonna do.

488
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:51,772
Well, that part's easy.

489
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:52,903
It is?

490
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:54,209
We're gonna stand
behind our people,

491
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,689
same as we always do.

492
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:56,820
It's not the same.

493
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:58,169
Look, if I cave on this,

494
00:20:58,213 --> 00:20:59,910
One PP caves with me.

495
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:01,912
When I choose
to leave this place,

496
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:03,827
it's gonna be
by walking out that door,

497
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,916
not picking my way
through a pile of rubble.

498
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,483
Not sure that's gonna
play on Broadway.

499
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:10,269
You're right, Garrett.
It isn't the same.

500
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:14,098
It is ten times more important
than when I took this office,

501
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:17,624
before the airwaves and the
Internet became the courtroom

502
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:20,583
and the public
became judge and jury.

503
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:31,681
An officer come in?

504
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,118
Not today.

505
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:36,120
Thanks.

506
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:37,818
2-9 Sergeant to Central.

507
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:40,864
Can you raise patrol post 16 on
the air and ascertain her 10-7?

508
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:42,779
Officer is missing from
her designated meal location

509
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:44,868
at this time.

510
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:48,916
Disregard, Central.

511
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:51,135
The officer in question
has been accounted for.

512
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,964
Officer Brooks,
where the hell were you?

513
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:55,879
I decided midafternoon pizza
wasn't such a good idea,

514
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:57,446
and this place
has killer salads.

515
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,708
You should've called
it in if you were gonna

516
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:00,188
change your meal location.Yeah, it was just

517
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:01,885
down the block. I didn't think
that was such a big deal.

518
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:03,670
I could've thought you were
involved in a police action.

519
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:05,933
Geez, take it easy,
Sarge. It's just a salad.

520
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:08,152
10-2 the house. You just got
yourself another one.

521
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:10,981
A rip? You mean like last time?

522
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:14,333
10-2 the house... now.

523
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:27,955
Tell me this
is some sort of joke.

524
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:30,827
Officer Brooks wasn't present
at her reported meal location.

525
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:32,263
She was 50 feet away.

526
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:33,352
She still should've
called it in.

527
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,440
She could've been in trouble.

528
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:35,963
You've got something
against her?

529
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:38,182
- No, sir.
- Then you've got something against me.

530
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:39,793
- I don't follow, boss.
- You didn't like...

531
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,055
the fact that I tossed your rip,

532
00:22:41,098 --> 00:22:42,839
wanted to find a way
to give her another one.

533
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:44,885
- No, that's not it at all.
- What, then?

534
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:46,713
She's entitled,
and it's only a matter of time

535
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:48,279
before that chip
on her shoulder puts her

536
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:50,543
or someone else in danger.I put her on your squad

537
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,414
so that you could teach
her, not toss the book

538
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,981
at her every time
she breathes funny.

539
00:22:54,024 --> 00:22:55,983
I'm ripping this one up, too.

540
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:57,985
You sure that's the only reason
that you put her on my squad?

541
00:22:58,028 --> 00:23:00,074
Excuse me?You've never thrown out
one of my CDs before.

542
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:01,380
And now you've done it twice.

543
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:02,946
What exactly are you implying?

544
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,295
I'm not implying anything.
I'm just pointing out a fact.

545
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:06,167
Here's a fact:
you question me on this again,

546
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,082
and it won't be
a rookie getting the rip.

547
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,300
You hear me?

548
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:11,564
Loud and clear.

549
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:27,710
My father wasn't arrested,
but he left me, too.

550
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:30,234
I struggled with it
for a long time.

551
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:33,237
After I met Daniel,
everything changed.

552
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,065
Daniel Shapiro, right?

553
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:37,067
Yeah.
What's he like?

554
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:38,199
He's great.

555
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:41,115
A brilliant mind
and the most open heart.

556
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:43,030
He founded this group

557
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:44,597
to share them both.

558
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,077
I heard he had some trouble
with his ex-girlfriend.

559
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:49,776
You're talking about
Yelena Page?

560
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:53,823
Yelena had a lot of bad energy.

561
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:56,043
The whole case against him
is because people just

562
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:58,262
don't understand what it is
that we do here.

563
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:01,178
What is it that you do
do here?

564
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:04,094
Well...
Why, we help each other heal, of course.

565
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:08,098
Jess...

566
00:24:08,142 --> 00:24:10,884
this is Daniel Shapiro.

567
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:12,494
A pleasure.

568
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:15,454
I see you've already met Ruby,
the gem of us all.

569
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,107
Please.

570
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:19,501
- Where are you from, Jess?
- Wisconsin.

571
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:22,025
Midwest girl,
born and raised.

572
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:24,332
Jess lost her father, too.
He went to prison

573
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,899
when she was young.

574
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:28,075
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- What for?

575
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:30,077
He was running a Ponzi scheme.

576
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,645
I thought you said
that it was domestic violence.

577
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:35,517
It was, the first time.

578
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:37,911
It sounds complicated.

579
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:42,568
Daniel runs a meditation retreat
at our farm upstate.

580
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:44,787
There's one coming up,
if you're interested.

581
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:46,659
I'll think about it.

582
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:48,138
We'd love to have you.

583
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:50,097
I'm sure there's so much
we could learn from each other.

584
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:53,230
It's so nice to see
you again, Tracy.

585
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:55,624
Our other newcomer.

586
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:58,061
If you'll excuse me.

587
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:02,022
Who's that girl?

588
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:03,850
Tracy.

589
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:05,504
She's been coming
around the shop lately.

590
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:09,203
Something off about
her, if you ask me.

591
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:18,168
Detective McKenzie.

592
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:20,606
Yeah.

593
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,086
Commissioner.

594
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:26,176
Sit down, please.

595
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:39,189
Okay, first of all,
I'm so sorry about all this.

596
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:42,062
I can take it.
My family, not so much.

597
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:45,195
Nobody should have
to go through this.

598
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,938
All due respect, boss...

599
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:52,115
your initial notification to IAB
is what kicked this all off.

600
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,944
Well, as I think you know,

601
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:58,818
we have a policy
for pursuing due diligence.

602
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:01,429
Well, this judge is the one
who should be investigated.

603
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:02,865
Well, I can't do that.

604
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,867
It would look like
I'm strong-arming him.

605
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:05,999
But he's just playing
to the peanut gallery

606
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:07,174
and exaggerating my record.

607
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:09,611
And any cop with a great career

608
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:12,701
is bound to have
a few complaints on his sheet.

609
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,705
Nothing I've done deserves this.

610
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:20,317
What? You agree with him?

611
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:22,885
Good God, no.

612
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:25,801
I'm rejecting his recommendation
for termination.

613
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:29,022
I'm announcing that at a press
conference tomorrow morning.

614
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:31,328
That's it?

615
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:35,506
Passing the buck,
that's all that is.

616
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,160
All due respect.

617
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:40,642
None taken.

618
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:43,340
You got to shut this down,
once and for all.

619
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,647
Shout it out loud to city hall,

620
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:47,518
to the A.G. up in Albany,

621
00:26:47,562 --> 00:26:50,826
to the civil courts judges:
no more going after this guy.

622
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,220
I can't do that, Detective.Well, you're the
police commissioner.

623
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:54,613
Who can speak out
for this office

624
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:57,180
but this office only.

625
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:04,013
I haven't been able
to get my kids to school.

626
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:07,538
And yesterday, my wife
had a bottle thrown at her.

627
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:10,063
Look, you want police escorts,
you got them.

628
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:12,848
Who wants to live like that?

629
00:27:12,892 --> 00:27:15,851
And my children seeing me on TV,

630
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:19,246
every step I take
like a perp walk?

631
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:25,687
They used to look at me
like I was their hero.

632
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,130
I didn't dismiss you, Detective.

633
00:27:36,176 --> 00:27:38,091
I'm sorry, Commissioner,

634
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:42,312
but I won't put my family
through this any longer.

635
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:44,358
Let's give the public
what it wants.

636
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:47,578
And what's that?

637
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:51,191
Me, gone.

638
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:03,116
You walk away,
you're letting them win.

639
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,162
They already have.

640
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:19,175
Sir?

641
00:28:37,193 --> 00:28:39,674
- And you're sure it was Ramona?
- I double-checked...

642
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,067
the picture you showed me.

643
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:44,287
Well, maybe she went down
there to dig for dirt

644
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:46,681
after I blew her off
at the panel, but...

645
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,248
You told her
that you'd look into it.

646
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,250
I told her, "No promises,"

647
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:52,295
but maybe she just heard, "No."

648
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:55,646
The phone is dead.

649
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,561
Roommate hasn't seen her
since Friday.

650
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:00,390
She failed to show up for class
this morning,

651
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:02,088
which, apparently,
is unlike her.

652
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:03,916
- Family hear anything?
- Nada.

653
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,701
Ruby was
already suspicious of her.

654
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,572
Probably didn't take
Shapiro long to figure out

655
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:10,270
she was Yelena's roommate.

656
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:11,445
And where are you going?

657
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,186
I'm gonna go look
for this Ruby girl.

658
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:14,384
- Come on. Not again.
- Anthony...

659
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:15,754
we're running out of time.

660
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,103
Erin, we got this.

661
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:18,974
We're gonna find her.

662
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:20,976
I promise.

663
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:29,432
Jess!

664
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:35,251
Wait. What's going on?

665
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:36,600
Tell her, Eddie.

666
00:29:36,644 --> 00:29:38,994
Eddie? You're not Jess?

667
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:41,344
We need to know where we
can find Daniel Shapiro.

668
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:43,216
I don't understand.
You're a cop?

669
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:44,565
- Yes.
- But...

670
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:45,958
why?

671
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:49,135
Why are you guys
always going after him?

672
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:51,398
There's a girl missing.
You know her as Tracy.

673
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:53,835
She was last seen
with Shapiro.

674
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,881
That doesn't mean
that he did anything.

675
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:57,186
Look, we don't have
time for games.

676
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,361
Where the hell is he?

677
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:00,102
He wouldn't do anything
to her. I swear.

678
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:01,277
Ruby,

679
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:02,626
I know this is hard,

680
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,672
but you need to listen.

681
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:06,065
You lied to me.

682
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:08,850
- Everything you said was a lie.
- No, no.

683
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:10,199
Everything Shapiro does...

684
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:12,854
is to lie to take advantage
of vulnerable women.

685
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,290
Including you.

686
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:16,292
I don't believe you.

687
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:18,120
Ruby, we got to find this girl

688
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:20,731
before something
really bad happens to her.

689
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:23,386
All right,
either you're

690
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,649
gonna help us,
or I'm gonna throw you in jail.

691
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:27,260
You got me?

692
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,058
Ruby. What are
you doing here?

693
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:44,407
I wanted to bring Jess by.

694
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,192
I thought that you
could talk to her

695
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:47,846
about the upcoming retreat.

696
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:49,456
I told you I didn't
want to be bothered.

697
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:53,068
Fine.

698
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:01,250
Why don't you take a seat.

699
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:02,948
Okay.

700
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,776
I just need a
moment with Ruby.

701
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:08,388
It's okay.

702
00:31:45,729 --> 00:31:47,862
No!

703
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,299
No...!

704
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:52,519
Anthony. Anthony,
can you hear me?

705
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:57,263
I think I found her.

706
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:58,960
Hello?

707
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,484
Anthony, hello?

708
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:04,270
Who are you talking to, Jess?

709
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:05,401
Police!

710
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:06,750
Hands off me!

711
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,496
Don't fight me! Police!

712
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:17,283
Hands where I can see them.

713
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:18,675
Put your hands
where I can see them now!

714
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,676
Janko!

715
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,764
Don't move.

716
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:22,418
Ruby, I got this. Stay back.

717
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:23,985
Janko, you all right?

718
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:25,813
I'm fine. I think
Ramona's in there.

719
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,163
Roll over now.

720
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:29,338
Now!

721
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:39,696
Police. Everything's okay.

722
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,176
Everything's okay.

723
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,091
Hey. Hey.

724
00:32:43,135 --> 00:32:44,701
It's okay. It's okay.
We got you.

725
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:46,007
We got you, okay?

726
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:48,401
Ramona. Ramona, we got you.
We got you, okay?

727
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:49,576
I got you.

728
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:52,013
We got you. We got you.

729
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:54,015
We got you. Okay.

730
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:05,418
So, Ross's alibi checked out.

731
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:07,463
For the murder, anyway.

732
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:09,117
What are you looking at?

733
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:11,772
Surveillance footage of Pia's
hotel, night of the shooting.

734
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:13,861
But we put her on
the back burner.

735
00:33:13,904 --> 00:33:15,471
She was in by 9:00 p.m.

736
00:33:15,515 --> 00:33:17,386
and not out again
until the next morning.

737
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,518
Except she wasn't
the only person

738
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:19,475
who slept there that night.

739
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:24,350
Her bodyguard?

740
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:25,655
Ky Bishop.

741
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:28,093
And he didn't sleep
in his own room.

742
00:33:28,136 --> 00:33:30,399
They're sleeping together?Looks like.

743
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:33,489
Here he is slipping out of
the back door of the hotel

744
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:35,361
at 11:00 p.m.,

745
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:37,537
and here is him
not returning to the hotel

746
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,365
until 4:00 a.m.

747
00:33:39,408 --> 00:33:41,062
Fits the timeline
of the shooting.

748
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:42,672
Sure as hell does.You think Pia sent him

749
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:43,847
to do her dirty work?

750
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:46,111
Or he caught
feelings for her

751
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:48,896
and tried to avenge her
honor with Gooding somehow.

752
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:50,724
Sounds like a real love story.

753
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:53,031
Well, the love story
just took another twist.

754
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,772
Ky Bishop was just added
as a backstage guest

755
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:57,774
for Cameron Gooding's show
tonight.

756
00:33:57,818 --> 00:33:59,080
What time does it start?

757
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:00,386
Now.

758
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:12,789
Yeah?

759
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,530
They're ready for you.

760
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:18,969
Let's do this.

761
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,929
He's on his way.

762
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,562
There he is!Here he comes.

763
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:54,048
Police!

764
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,658
- Don't move! Police!
- I'll take that.

765
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:58,400
- No, no, no.
- He's got it, he's got it.

766
00:34:58,444 --> 00:35:00,663
You're expecting
someone else maybe?

767
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:03,275
Get him out of here.

768
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:06,321
Who the hell is that?

769
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:10,151
That's Pia Toledo's
bodyguard or lover.

770
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:11,370
She sent him?

771
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:13,937
No. No, apparently
she didn't have any idea.

772
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:15,939
He wanted to avenge her?

773
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:19,552
Such a stupid reason
for Allen to die.

774
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:21,249
Yeah.

775
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:23,947
Look, if you want,
we can give you an escort home.

776
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:26,298
Guys, get onstage.

777
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:28,474
My whole life,

778
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:30,432
people have paid
for my mistakes.

779
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:32,478
But no one ever died for one.

780
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:36,351
I'm dedicating
the show tonight to Allen.

781
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,396
You're still going on?

782
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:38,484
Hell, yeah.

783
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:39,702
And you two
are coming out with me

784
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:41,487
so I can thank you
in front of everybody.

785
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,011
Well, we-we...
No, we appreciate that,

786
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:46,100
but we can't.
We have paperwork to do.

787
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,536
You sure?

788
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,190
You could help me open up.

789
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:50,844
I know you know all the lyrics.

790
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:55,109
In another lifetime.

791
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:07,643
So, when do you leave?

792
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:10,168
Day after tomorrow.I hear the rent's

793
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:12,518
even higher in San Francisco
than it is here.

794
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:13,519
Is that even possible?

795
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:14,607
What are you
complaining about?

796
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,696
You got the hookup
from your CO.

797
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:18,698
I'll be living in one of
the economically challenged

798
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:20,395
neighborhoods
I'm helping, so rent

799
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:22,005
will be manageable.

800
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:23,572
You know which one yet?

801
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,226
The start-up's putting me up
while I sort out

802
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,793
- a place to stay.
- I'm hoping it will be...

803
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:28,534
near public transportation.

804
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:29,970
- I would think so.
- Which is what...

805
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:31,363
exactly, in San Francisco?

806
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:33,669
One of those, 
Rice-A-Roni cable cars?

807
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:35,323
Do you have any friends there?

808
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:37,717
a couple from school,
but it'll be an adjustment.

809
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,153
A big adjustment.

810
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,503
I mean, you have to
find a new bagel shop.

811
00:36:41,547 --> 00:36:42,635
New pizza parlor.

812
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:44,114
And bacon, egg and cheese
on a roll.

813
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:45,377
I hear they close

814
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,508
the bars early, too.

815
00:36:46,552 --> 00:36:47,640
- Hey.
- What?

816
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:48,945
I was 22 once.

817
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:50,164
Okay.

818
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,166
I get it, guys.
It's not New York.

819
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,168
Nicky, I think what
everybody's trying to say

820
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,215
is congratulations
on landing a new job.

821
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:00,348
No small feat these days.

822
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:03,003
Well, thank you.What if you don't like it?

823
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:05,440
Then she will move back and
live with her dear old mom

824
00:37:05,484 --> 00:37:07,007
till the end of her days.

825
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,661
You'd hate that
more than I would.

826
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:09,662
True.

827
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:10,663
Hey, Francis and I

828
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:11,838
get along fine.

829
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:13,100
Don't we?

830
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:15,450
Kinda.

831
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:16,843
So, now that it's

832
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:19,715
actually happening,
are you more nervous or excited?

833
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:21,935
Honestly, it's hard to say.

834
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:23,545
When I was in Boston,
I'd walk the streets

835
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:25,417
to keep my mind and my feet
moving. Made me less homesick.

836
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,461
I didn't miss New York

837
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:27,767
'cause I never left,

838
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,335
which is the secret to
my long and happy life.

839
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:31,379
Right.

840
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:32,902
I missed New York so much,

841
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:35,557
we had Nathan's hot dogs
shipped all the way to Fallujah.

842
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:37,646
I think, for me,
it was calling my mom

843
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,257
maybe every other day.

844
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,694
Subtle.

845
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:43,086
A stack of Madmagazines
at summer camp.

846
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,132
What?You got bored sometimes.

847
00:37:45,175 --> 00:37:46,264
Baseball.

848
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:47,352
- Baseball?
- Yeah, I always

849
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:49,005
traveled with two gloves
and a ball.

850
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:51,007
It was easy to scare up
a game of catch.

851
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:53,793
Took me home to my own backyard.

852
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:55,882
What about you, Nicky?

853
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:59,494
Is organizing a Sunday potluck
too on the nose?

854
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:03,585
Wow, I sense the makings
of a new tradition.

855
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:05,283
Yeah.

856
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:13,943
Sure, come right in.

857
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:15,728
Since day one, you've been
protecting Officer Brooks,

858
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:17,469
- giving her special treatment.
- Be very careful

859
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:18,861
what you say next, Reagan.

860
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:20,167
You got a relationship with her,
one that's not

861
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,342
strictly professional.

862
00:38:21,386 --> 00:38:23,736
More careful than that.

863
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:28,088
You went to IAB?

864
00:38:28,131 --> 00:38:29,742
No.

865
00:38:29,785 --> 00:38:33,049
Look, Reagan,
I'm not sure what it is

866
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:34,442
you think
you know...

867
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:38,794
Officer Brooks's father was FDNY
and died on 9/11.

868
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:41,275
He was also the best man
at your wedding.

869
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,669
You conducted
your own investigation?

870
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,280
I was afraid I'd turn up
something worse.

871
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,420
Sarah came up rough,
made a few bad decisions.

872
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:58,814
I convinced her to take the
test, figured it would--

873
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:02,427
hoped that it would help
straighten her out.

874
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,604
Then you requested she be
put here, under your command.

875
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:08,389
Under yours. I put her
on your squad because I knew

876
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:10,826
you would be the best person
to get through to her.

877
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:14,917
Why haven't you let me
do my job?

878
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:17,485
If you're too harsh,
she'll cut and run.

879
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:20,793
Then we drag her back here
kicking and screaming.

880
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:21,968
But you're doing her no favors,

881
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:23,709
letting her off the hook
every time.

882
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:26,842
I guess I've got
a soft spot for her.

883
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:29,932
All the more reason I should be
the one making the decisions.

884
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:33,936
You're really growing
into those stripes, aren't you?

885
00:39:35,982 --> 00:39:37,853
That mean I can get back
to work?

886
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:40,639
Why are you still standing here?

887
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:57,133
I miss anything?

888
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:02,748
I've always been able to count
on hockey to distract me.

889
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:04,402
Moves so fast.

890
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:06,360
Meaning it's not
working tonight?

891
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:10,582
Did you try to talk him
out of it?

892
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:13,498
I'm the guy who started
his troubles.

893
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:16,892
You can't be both arsonist
and firefighter.

894
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:19,242
Notifying IAB was
the right thing to do. You...

895
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:21,462
The complaints had
to be investigated.

896
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:23,421
I'm not so sure.

897
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:24,857
It was by the book, Dad.

898
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,426
What good's the book
if no one else is reading it?

899
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,167
You don't mean that.

900
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:34,519
Your doubts about your boss
could've been passed up to IAB,

901
00:40:34,562 --> 00:40:35,868
by the book.

902
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:37,870
But you didn't.

903
00:40:39,785 --> 00:40:43,005
Because you see what I see.

904
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:46,400
No, I just took a breath.

905
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,402
No.

906
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:52,101
You hit the brakes
because you're a smart guy

907
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:55,278
in a careless time
when certain accusations,

908
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:58,630
by their very nature,
carry a penalty

909
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:02,982
the instant that accusation
is even whispered.

910
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:06,725
Whether it has merit or not

911
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:09,858
becomes utterly
beside the point.

912
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:15,908
I'm glad I hit the brakes.

913
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:18,867
So am I,

914
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:23,002
and so is your boss,
I'm sure, but...

915
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:26,962
going forward,
how the hell do we do our jobs?

916
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:30,139
By learning from our mistakes,
like always.

917
00:41:30,183 --> 00:41:32,968
You remember 
"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"?

918
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:34,404
Old movie?

919
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:35,797
Yeah.

920
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:38,365
This reporter's about to go
to press with a story

921
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:40,541
based largely on bunk,

922
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:43,936
and this other guy,
he challenges him.

923
00:41:43,979 --> 00:41:48,331
So the reporter says,
"This is the West, sir.

924
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:53,336
When the legend becomes fact,
print the legend."

925
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:56,644
So, like, forget
about the real facts?

926
00:41:57,689 --> 00:42:00,779
We got a version
of that going on.

927
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:02,911
So, what do we do?

928
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:07,307
I don't know.

929
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:11,964
I don't know.

930
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:14,923
But I do care.

1
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,591
So how's life as
an empty nester?

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,886
Oh, I miss Nicky a lot.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,431
Remember the first time
Nicky went away without us?

4
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,474
Dance camp.

5
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,268
You did not
ask to meet

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,104
to walk down
memory lane, did you?

7
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,524
Um, I, uh,
I joined a charity

8
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:27,610
that takes on
innocence cases.

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,112
Okay.

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,282
And I'm representing a client
that's been in prison

11
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:36,453
for five years, uh, and, uh,
Erin, he didn't do it.

12
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,788
He tell you that?

13
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,790
He was put away
for murder

14
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,959
based largely on an
eyewitness account,

15
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,919
and the witness
recanted,

16
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,797
and the, uh, the detective
who handled the case, um,

17
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:52,010
let's just say this wasn't his
first questionable conviction.

18
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,471
Well, doesn't sound
like a slam dunk.

19
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,514
Trust me, this kid
was railroaded.

20
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,266
Kid?

21
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,188
Yeah, he was 20 when
he went into the system.

22
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,524
Okay, so why are you
coming to me?

23
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,944
Because you're the one
who put him away.

24
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,536
Leave him alone, yo.

25
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,536
This yours?

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,705
I asked you a question.
Is this yours?

27
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,457
No! Why don't y'all
get out of here.

28
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,333
Y'all should leave me be.

29
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,460
Hey, back it up.

30
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,460
Yo, everybody,
stay back!

31
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,171
Look, all right,
we're not gonna bring you in.

32
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,048
It's a summons instead.

33
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,467
Take this ticket,
all right?

34
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,467
A summons?

35
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,845
That's what you get!

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,563
Yo, let's just go to the car.

37
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,565
All right?

38
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,818
And the officers did nothing?

39
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,362
That's right, put their
tail between their legs

40
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,738
and got into their patrol car.

41
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,242
They both got less than
a year on the job.

42
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,619
That's no excuse.

43
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,619
No, it's just a fact, boss.

44
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,413
We don't teach our officers
not to fight back.

45
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,790
We're not teaching
them that, boss,

46
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,375
but it's open season on cops.

47
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,169
They should've arrested the guy
on the spot.

48
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,588
I agree with you, boss, but you
got the media and politicians

49
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,257
hammering them every day

50
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,716
with anti-cop stuff.

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,634
It has an effect.

52
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,719
And anyone complicit
needs to be found,

53
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,223
arrested, and charged with
everything we can throw at them.

54
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,850
We can put out a Finest Message
to the troops.

55
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,434
No, call a press conference.

56
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,811
I'll write something up.

57
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,564
I know what needs to be said.

58
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,737
Hey, you headed home?

59
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,781
Did you hear what happened
to DeNoon and Malone?

60
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,825
Yeah, I just saw that
on my phone. They okay?

61
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,410
No, they came back humiliated.

62
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,246
Who did it?

63
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,246
C.O. put up a screen grab
of the perp.

64
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,497
The guy wasn't arrested?

65
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,915
No, they did nothing.

66
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,418
They just got in their RMP
and left.

67
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,920
What do we got?

68
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,548
Miriam Harton, 85 years old,
was assaulted and robbed

69
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:57,093
in the vestibule as she entered
the building with groceries.

70
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,386
Perp came up
from behind her,

71
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,929
pushed her to the ground
and stomped her.

72
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,556
Any witnesses?

73
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,556
I wish.

74
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,600
Looks like she may have broken
a hip and maybe some ribs.

75
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,685
We should check to see
if there are any cameras...

76
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,604
No, I-I already asked.
Super's working on it.

77
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,314
My partner and I already
started a canvass.

78
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,607
Mrs. Harton.

79
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,151
Detective Reagan,
my partner Detective Baez.

80
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,653
Could you tell us about
the person who assaulted you?

81
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,072
He... I thought
he wanted to help.

82
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,908
He opened the door for me,

83
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,619
and then when I turned around,
he hit me.

84
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,329
It was a he, ma'am?

85
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,290
My husband will be
worried about me.

86
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,958
Ma'am, it's really important
that you give us a description

87
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,418
of the man who attacked you.
Could you?

88
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,295
My husband, my husband
is waiting for me

89
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,589
to come home with the groceries.

90
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,966
We need to
get her checked out.

91
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,966
Go ahead.

92
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,802
Waiting for me.

93
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,641
Hey. I want to talk to you.

94
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,851
Hey, bro, hey, hey, bro,
I didn't do nothing, all right?

95
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,187
You throw water on two police
officers earlier today?

96
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,521
Hey, come on, man,
throwing water

97
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,273
ain't no crime.
I ain't shoot nobody.

98
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,275
I'm talking to you.

99
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,275
Man, all right, so what?

100
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,152
Hey, you're under arrest.

101
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:59,322
Man, you can't arrest me
for throwing water on no scum!

102
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,658
It's just water,
my dude. Yo...

103
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,622
What the hell do you think
you're doing, you stupid dick?!

104
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:11,376
It's just water, right?
Hands behind your back.

105
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,336
Hey, bro, what?! Come on, man.

106
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,006
Yo, let him go!

107
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,006
No, he got rights!

108
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,591
What you taking him
away for?

109
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,329
I will not be taking questions.

110
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,499
Earlier today,
two police officers

111
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:55,712
were attacked by perpetrators
who threw water at them

112
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,715
while they were
performing their duties.

113
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,343
Anyone who throws water
on police officers,

114
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,763
who throws objects
at police officers,

115
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,892
who impedes an officer's ability
to do his job,

116
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,728
in any form,

117
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:16,190
is breaking the law,
and that will not be tolerated.

118
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,110
Anyone caught doing so
will be arrested

119
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:23,072
and charged to
the fullest extent of the law.

120
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,620
I want to be crystal clear
about this.

121
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,750
I will never, never

122
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,919
ask my officers
to tolerate abuse.

123
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:42,258
They put their life on the line
for every citizen in this city

124
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,594
every day,

125
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,138
and assaults and abuse

126
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,975
against the uniform
can and will be met

127
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,727
by zero tolerance.

128
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,145
That is all.

129
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,817
What do you say
to those people

130
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,445
who take the position
that it's only water?

131
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,572
Today it's a bucket of water,

132
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,283
tomorrow it's a bucket
of "who knows what."

133
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,619
Some might say that
the relationship between police

134
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,622
and residents of predominantly
minority neighborhoods

135
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,458
is strained and this incident is
a culmination of that breakdown.

136
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,878
I'm sorry, that's all
we have time for today.

137
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,511
Son of a bitch
could've just robbed her.

138
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,845
He didn't have to beat her up.

139
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,514
Did you zoom in?

140
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,974
I've been over this
with a microscope.

141
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,976
Well, it can't be
his first time, then.

142
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,978
No, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

143
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,524
There have been
four reported incidents

144
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,776
of robbery and assault
against senior citizens

145
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,112
in this neighborhood
in the past three months.

146
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,988
Same M.O.?

147
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,158
Same exact M.O.
The perp targets an old person,

148
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,993
he enters their building,
pretends to help them,

149
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,245
then he knocks them down

150
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,331
and takes all their stuff.

151
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,331
Any arrests?

152
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,000
There was one arrest
Matthew Greer, 32 years old.

153
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,545
He's a delivery driver
who was arrested

154
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:04,006
for assaulting and robbing
an 85-year-old man.

155
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,050
He broke two of his
ribs and his jawbone.

156
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,385
Where's this scumbag now?

157
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,011
He was arrested,
but the charges were dropped,

158
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,931
so now he's out on the streets.

159
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,560
Not for long.

160
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,861
Let me help you with that.

161
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,362
Thank you.

162
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,161
All right, hey,
where's the money?

163
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,204
I don't have money.

164
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,204
Where's the money?
Where's the wallet?

165
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,664
You don't have money?

166
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,664
I have nothing.

167
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,999
So you got nothing?

168
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,878
Damn it!

169
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,388
Matthew Greer?

170
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,517
He's not here.

171
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,853
Must be out on a delivery.

172
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,856
Reagan.

173
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,777
Matthew Greer?

174
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,777
Detective Baez.

175
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,571
This is Detective Reagan.
We have some questions for you.

176
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,114
I'll move the truck.

177
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,074
No, no, it's not
about the truck.

178
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,577
Someone, please,

179
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,953
call 911!

180
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,247
Stay with him.

181
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,247
It's Mr. Weissberg.

182
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,416
He must've fallen.

183
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:23,794
Police. Step aside, ma'am.
Sir, you okay?

184
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,005
Someone pushed me.

185
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,005
Who?

186
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,132
I don't know.

187
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,132
Was it a guy with a hat?

188
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,800
I don't know.

189
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,052
Son of a bitch.

190
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,054
Call an ambulance,
ma'am, right now.

191
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:33,971
Hurry up.

192
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,933
Hey!

193
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,933
No. Oh, come on.

194
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,434
Hey!

195
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,434
I don't have time for this.
I'm sorry.

196
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:40,603
I'm sorry. I-I got to go.

197
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:40,603
Get him. Get him off there.

198
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,105
Let's go. Out of the truck.

199
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,105
Hey. Okay.

200
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:43,940
Come here.

201
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:43,940
I didn't...

202
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,608
I didn't even do anything.

203
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,608
Come here.

204
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,778
Ow.

205
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,778
You like beating up
old people, tough guy?

206
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,072
I didn't beat
up nobody.

207
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,116
Really? You didn't
beat up Miriam Harton?

208
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,619
That was lying on the ground.
It was just lying right there.

209
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,162
Yeah, right beside her
where you left her.

210
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,248
Hands against
the car.

211
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,628
Darnell Johnson he was accused
of murdering Muhammad Akin,

212
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,004
another gang member.

213
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,631
So a public service
homicide.

214
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,092
His fingerprints and his hat
were found at the scene

215
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:14,095
and a witness identified
him as the shooter.

216
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,305
Wait a minute,
this case is five years old.

217
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,807
Why are we
looking at this?

218
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,475
Darnell is saying
he's innocent.

219
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:22,603
Erin, everyone at Rikers
is saying they're innocent.

220
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,980
Uh, everyone
at Sing Sing,

221
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,940
everyone in
every jail everywhere

222
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:26,983
says they're innocent.

223
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,776
The witness recanted.

224
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,362
Yeah, but his DNA
i-is still at the scene.

225
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,823
How'd this case
come to you?

226
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,993
Jack. He's working with
the Innocence Project.

227
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,869
I should've known.

228
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,205
Every time
this guy comes around,

229
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,415
there's trouble, every time.

230
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:46,627
I need to know that I didn't
put away an innocent person

231
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,170
for the last five years
of his life.

232
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,755
I can't just hand that off
to someone else.

233
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,174
And he knows that, uh,
which is why he goes to you

234
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,718
instead of the proper channels.

235
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:54,719
Are you going to help me

236
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,013
or are you going to lecture me
on Jack Boyle?

237
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,098
Both.

238
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,146
Uh, this witness
why'd she recant?

239
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,024
Uh, and does Darnell,
does he have an alibi?

240
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,525
That's what we need to find out.

241
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,360
Hey, you know
what I need to find out?

242
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,487
Why you give Jack
the benefit of the doubt

243
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,282
every single time
he comes to your door.

244
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,207
Where were you October 30th
at 8:15 a.m.?

245
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,751
Work.

246
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,544
No, you weren't.

247
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:30,379
You recognize her?

248
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,547
No.

249
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,049
That's funny

250
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,176
'cause you had her stolen
credit card in your pocket.

251
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,385
That's criminal
possession.

252
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,054
I told you I found it.

253
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,722
What?

254
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,223
Detectives.

255
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,392
St. Irene's Hospital's
on the line.

256
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,102
You want to take it?

257
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,645
I'm good.

258
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,234
I found that card.

259
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,234
Shut your mouth.

260
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,570
You knocked
that old man down.

261
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,570
I did not.

262
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:55,738
Yes, you did.

263
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,240
You were arrested for assault
and robbery last month.

264
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,493
Yeah, and I got released.

265
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,079
Because you target old men
and you target old women

266
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,747
who can't positively I.D. you

267
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,624
because their memories aren't
so good, isn't that right?

268
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,668
I don't target nobody.

269
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,921
You don't target nobody?

270
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,921
No.

271
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,214
That means you do target
somebody, dumb-dumb.

272
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,590
It's a double negative.

273
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,133
What?

274
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,762
Kind of like I don't believe
you're not the perp, stupid.

275
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,347
I'm done answering questions.

276
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,682
The hell you are...

277
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,682
Danny.

278
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,647
Sit tight, tough guy.

279
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,320
Yes?

280
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,947
Charges have changed.

281
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,365
What are you talking about?

282
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,450
Well, if we can nail
that son of a bitch,

283
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,285
the charge just changed
to murder.

284
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,620
Why?

285
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,373
Mrs. Harton just died
of her injuries.

286
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,752
I ain't shoot nobody!

287
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,379
Hey! You're under arrest.

288
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,675
Hey, yo, you cannot arrest me
for throwing water on no scum!

289
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,428
It's just water,
my dude! Yo...

290
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,181
You just saw a cell phone video

291
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,267
that shows
Sergeant Jamison Reagan,

292
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,686
the youngest son of Police
Commissioner Frank Reagan,

293
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,981
as he throws water
on an unarmed suspect,

294
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,276
Renzo Williams, who is now
claiming police brutality.

295
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,824
I guess I was fooling myself
thinking this might not get out.

296
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,869
Do you want to see them
now? They're already here.

297
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:27,997
Them?

298
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,292
Sergeant Reagan
and Lieutenant Gormley.

299
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,005
Okay.

300
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,638
I asked the lieutenant to sit in
to represent the rank and file.

301
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,515
Baker, please join us.

302
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,354
You want backup, I want backup.

303
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,023
Please sit down.

304
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,657
...not
arrest me for throwing water

305
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,867
on no scum!

306
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,702
It's just water, my dude!
Yo...

307
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,385
I know what you're gonna say,
but throwing water on him

308
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,221
was a less lethal way
to subdue an unruly...

309
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,224
I read your report. You get
an "A" for creative writing.

310
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,434
That's what happened,
Commissioner.

311
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,230
Well, let's talk about
what really happened, Sergeant.

312
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,399
You went after the suspect
because you were pissed off.

313
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,235
Lieutenant, was my arrest
within department guidelines?

314
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,861
Absolutely.

315
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,656
The arrest was.

316
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,283
Your actions were not.

317
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,202
Detective,
would you remind us all

318
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,622
of the charge
the sergeant faces?

319
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,959
That would be "bringing undue
criticism upon the department."

320
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,293
Thank you.

321
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,879
You have effectively
changed the narrative

322
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,550
from cops under attack
to the opposite.

323
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,135
That video doesn't show
what happened right before that.

324
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,055
Exactly. And that's how
this usually goes down.

325
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,891
Which is why cops are expected
to show restraint.

326
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,309
There was no physical harm done.

327
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,937
You brought harm
to this department.

328
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,063
By standing up for my cops?

329
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,107
Is that what you think
you were doing?

330
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,107
Those cops

331
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,024
walked away
this morning because

332
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,110
they were afraid
of backlash, Commissioner.

333
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,279
So you created
even more backlash?

334
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,948
I sent a message that
it's not okay to assault cops.

335
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,575
It's not okay
to assault perps, either.

336
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,451
That's not exactly
what happened.

337
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,913
I stand by my actions.

338
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,915
Well...

339
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,627
your actions have brought you
a command discipline.

340
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,504
Are you serious?

341
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,880
You're dismissed.

342
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,510
Do you want to know what
that guy said to me beforehand?

343
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,429
Return to your command,
Sergeant.

344
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,514
Do you even want to know?

345
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,309
Dismissed.

346
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,002
Why'd you drop the charges
against Matthew Greer?

347
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,171
Charges were reduced.

348
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,131
Reduced? What...?

349
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,342
The injuries that he gave
to Mrs. Harton

350
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,509
are the reason she died.

351
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,510
That's murder.

352
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,512
You have evidence that
Matthew Greer did it?

353
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,014
'Cause I saw the
security footage.

354
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,808
You can't tell it's him.

355
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,808
Well, it's his M.O.

356
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,270
Without a positive I.D. from
a victim, I can only charge him

357
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,855
with criminal possession
of stolen property.

358
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,855
What...

359
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:42,191
Stolen property? How about
the fact that he assaulted

360
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,193
an 85-year-old man,
left him with a broken jaw?

361
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,403
Again, do you have evidence?

362
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:50,032
I was standing outside the
building when Greer ran outside

363
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,160
moments after an old man
was assaulted inside.

364
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,162
So you saw Matthew
Greer do it?

365
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,083
Look, I have a positive I.D.
from the victim.

366
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,085
Oh, no. I read
the report, Danny.

367
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,544
That victim has dementia.

368
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,088
You know damn well
the defense attorney's

369
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,382
going to tear him and the
case apart on the stand.

370
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,884
Okay. What if it was Grandpa?

371
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,884
Oh, my God.

372
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,344
No, I'm serious.
What if it was Grandpa?

373
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,221
Danny, do you think
I want to tell you

374
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,389
you need more evidence?

375
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,224
Well, that's all
you ever tell me.

376
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,224
Well, guess what?

377
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,810
It's my job,
and sometimes it sucks.

378
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:28,654
Gramps? Dropping off the meat
for Sunday dinner.

379
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,074
Danny boy.

380
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,535
Hey.

381
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,535
How was work?

382
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,787
You know. Same old, same old.

383
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,248
Erin being a pain in my ass.

384
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,249
About what?

385
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,919

Well...

386
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:47,923
I got a perp who's robbing
and assaulting elderly people.

387
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:50,259
And, uh, you know, I got
a victim to I.D. him,

388
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,428
but she doesn't think
that's enough, of course.

389
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,263
Why?

390
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,263
Because she thinks

391
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,556
that the victim has dementia,

392
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,307
so she doesn't want
to put him on the stand.

393
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,935
Maybe she's setting up
roadblocks for a reason.

394
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,061
Gramps, I get

395
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,273
the roadblocks, and I understand
that people rob people,

396
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,274
but this is different.

397
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,984
This is a bad
guy. You know?

398
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,652
He doesn't just take money
from these people,

399
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,904
h-he stomps on them
and punches them.

400
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,282
B-Believe me, you'd feel
the same way I do if you saw it.

401
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,617
I do feel the same way you do.

402
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,453
In fact,

403
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,122
it's my greatest fear.

404
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,623
Getting mugged again?

405
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,586
No. I'll take a beating
any old day.

406
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,296
What I'm most afraid of
is the things

407
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:31,175
that I can't fight back against,
like dementia.

408
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,931
You seem sharp
as a tack to me, Gramps.

409
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,349
Yeah, and then
one day you're not.

410
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:44,229
It's gotten to so many
of my old friends.

411
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,651
They don't know
their own family.

412
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:54,990
Well, if the day ever comes
where you don't recognize me,

413
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:58,202
don't know who I am,
we'll be okay.

414
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:01,163
'Cause I'll always
know who you are.

415
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,381
The witness might've changed
her story, but Darnell's prints

416
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,842
and his hat were still
at the crime scene.

417
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,469
Right.

418
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,179
Hi.

419
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,179
Hi, Jack.

420
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,181
I got stuff to do.

421
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,308
Sit down.

422
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,308
Uh...

423
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,726
I didn't, uh, mean to interrupt.

424
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,353
You never do.

425
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,646
I just wanted to see

426
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,189
if I can help in any way.

427
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,024
I think you've done enough.

428
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,401
Am I missing something here?

429
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,820
Yeah, a stop button.

430
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,404
Okay, Anthony...

431
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,365
No, no, no.
No, let's have it, Anthony.

432
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,533
Because I'm actually wondering
if there's some sort

433
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,368
of statute of limitations
on your attitude towards me?

434
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,577
Well, maybe

435
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,871
if you stop coming to Erin
every time you had a problem.

436
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,374
Yeah, b uh, we have history.

437
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,374
Yeah. Right.

438
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,876
And you screwed up, but somehow
you still think she owes you.

439
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,044
Is that about right?

440
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,046
Okay, do we need
to do this right now?

441
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:53,465
I'll be back later.

442
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,388
He's just being protective.

443
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,390
I didn't know you needed
protection from me.

444
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,600
We've been going
through the case.

445
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:08,188
I spoke with Chantal, who
recanted her original testimony.

446
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,357
She said that
the detective told her

447
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,192
that Darnell was the shooter.

448
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,777
See?

449
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,529
Well, I want to talk
to the detective.

450
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,738
Oh, don't bother.

451
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,074
Oh, so now you gonna tell me

452
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:20,701
how to run my investigation?

453
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,288
No. I'm suggesting you not
interview the detective

454
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,123
because he is dead.

455
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,916
Oh.

456
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,543
I'm not
the enemy here.

457
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,460
I wish that
this hadn't happened

458
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,795
as much as you do.

459
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,046
Well, I'm not
convinced

460
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,423
it did happen,

461
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,259
because I haven't uncovered
enough to believe

462
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,429
beyond reasonable doubt
that Darnell is innocent.

463
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,972
Yeah, well, there's one person
intimately involved

464
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,933
with the case
who you haven't spoken to yet.

465
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,018
And who's that?

466
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,437
Darnell Johnson.

467
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,995
You're in exceptionally early.

468
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,414
As are you three.

469
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,791
Those perps that
threw water

470
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,460
at our officers at the 2-9,

471
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,463
including the copycats
at the 15th,

472
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,465
have all been arrested
without incident.

473
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,592
The D.A.'s office charged them
with disorderly conduct,

474
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,844
criminal nuisance
and harassment.

475
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,512
All of them took a plea.

476
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,098
Okay.

477
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,100
That's a copy of the press
release from the D.A.'s office.

478
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,477
It'll be sent out
this afternoon.

479
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,688
Good news. Thank you all.

480
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,992
Sit down.

481
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,621
Did you take a close look
at the video of Jamie's arrest?

482
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,665
Did I miss something?

483
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,124
Well, maybe
you missed

484
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,460
that Jamie is not
one of the rank and file.

485
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,503
He's a boss.

486
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,005
And he sees his guys
getting assaulted and he...

487
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,424
And instead of using his head,

488
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,052
he went out on his own
to collar the guy.

489
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,720
I would've done
the same thing as him.

490
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,556
No, you would not.
Not from where you sit.

491
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,976
Well, only because I know
how you'd react.

492
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,978
Exactly.

493
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,022
And Jamie should know that
better than anyone, Sid.

494
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,692
That arrest sent out
a clear message.

495
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,652
He sent the wrong message.

496
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,362
Maybe you are, too.

497
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,489
Meaning?

498
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:26,576
A rip for a little bit of water,
in light of what that guy did?

499
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,828
Come on, boss.

500
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,871
We can't do what perps do.

501
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,375
He was resisting arrest.
I mean, this could've escalated.

502
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,918
Jamie could've Tasered him.

503
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,086
Would that have
been better?

504
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,713
And coming up
with worse scenarios

505
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,048
doesn't excuse this one.

506
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,802
Okay. Okay.

507
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,554
You assured the public
and the department

508
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,889
that you've got our cops' back.

509
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,558
Maybe you ought to make sure

510
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,477
your son knows
you got his back, too.

511
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,588
Mr. Johnson, I don't know
if you remember me, but I'm...

512
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,423
I know who you are.

513
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,632
Okay.

514
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,635
I've been reviewing your case,

515
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,387
and I have a few
questions for you.

516
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,639
Okay.

517
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,639
I spoke to Chantal.

518
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:34,269
As you know, she recanted
her original testimony.

519
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:37,606
But your fingerprints and your
hat were found at the scene.

520
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,274
So?

521
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,274
So,

522
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,069
during the trial
you never took the stand.

523
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,405
You never explained
why they were there.

524
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,282
They were there
because I went to see Muhammed

525
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,617
earlier that day.

526
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,160
But I didn't kill him.

527
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,661
What did you go see him about?

528
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,746
He owed me money.

529
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,081
Drug money?

530
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,832
What difference
does that make now?

531
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,584
I need to know everything
that happened.

532
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,295
I'll tell you what
you need to know.

533
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:06,802
You need to know that I've been
in this hellhole

534
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:12,390
for 1,667 days.

535
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,602
Because of you.

536
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,355
My son turns five

537
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:21,108
in a month.

538
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,027
And I've only
met him once.

539
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,321
Because of you.

540
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,657
Why didn't you take the stand?

541
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,408
Why didn't you say

542
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,328
that you had gone to see
Muhammed earlier in the day?

543
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,996
Because my court-appointed
attorney told me

544
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,499
that if I said that, no one
would believe I didn't kill him.

545
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,626
You should've
told the truth.

546
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,003
I told the truth.

547
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,005
You didn't believe me.

548
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,676
And I can tell, just by looking
at you, that you still don't.

549
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,970
So you can go to hell.

550
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,203
Can you, uh, pass me
another slice of Key lime?

551
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,164
That's your third piece.

552
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,000
Well, I'm celebrating today,
Gramps.

553
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,169
It's the first time in my life
that I'm not taking flak

554
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,503
for being the hothead
of the family.

555
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,546
I'm not a hothead.

556
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,047
Says the hothead.

557
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,215
But don't
get me wrong,

558
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,760
I support what you did, 100%.

559
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,220
Me, too.

560
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,138
Cut it out.

561
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,138
Right,

562
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,514
'cause we wouldn't
want to hear from cops

563
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,849
at this table

564
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,058
how they feel about my collar,
would we?

565
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,393
Your arrest wasn't
the issue.

566
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,896
The manner of your arrest was.

567
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,272
Oh.

568
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,231
Anybody want to hear
what I think about it?

569
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,066
Not really.

570
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,066
Well, it's like

571
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,568
your broken window theory.

572
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,279
You know, you see somebody
doing damage to a property,

573
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,239
you start to think, "Okay,
nobody cares about it,"

574
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,783
so more people start to do
damage to the property.

575
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:54,951
Same thing with cops.

576
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,912
That's a bit of a stretch.

577
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,912
No, he's got a point.

578
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,039
Every day you hear
another story about a cop

579
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,125
being harassed for just doing
their job, and eventually,

580
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,960
it becomes
accepted practice

581
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,213
to harass cops.

582
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,213
Exactly right.

583
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,466
Not if cops arrest violators
when it happens,

584
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:13,220
within the confines of the law
and without malice.

585
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,596
I say

586
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,056
an eye for an eye.

587
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,766
Makes the whole world blind.

588
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,766
Exactly.

589
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,353
We don't have the luxury of
breaking rules to make a point.

590
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,231
Right, so just a different set
of rules for us. Is that it?

591
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,274
Exactly right.

592
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,943
Cops should be held

593
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,152
to a higher standard.

594
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,111
And what about D.A.s?

595
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,322
Should they be held
to a higher standard, too?

596
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,074
Really?

597
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,074
Yeah.

598
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,951
So, how come when a cop
makes a mistake,

599
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,495
they're crucified in the media,
they lose their jobs

600
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,330
and there's no room
for human error,

601
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,375
but when a D.A. makes a mistake,
nothing happens to them?

602
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,126
That's right.
You see stories all the time

603
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,170
about people being locked up

604
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,422
for years, and then it turns
out that they are innocent.

605
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,174
Yeah, what happens
to the D.A.

606
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,385
in those circumstances, sis?

607
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,263
They apologize? No, they don't
even bother to apologize.

608
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,265
They just move on
with their lives.

609
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,642
No one moves on from
a wrongful prosecution, Danny,

610
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,937
and all we have are the facts,
not crystal balls.

611
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,815
Mm-hmm. You know, Sean,
the, uh, broken windows theory

612
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,651
about cops, it also applies to
old people. Did you know that?

613
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,988
Yeah. See, if someone thinks

614
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,948
a certain group
of people is broken,

615
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:18,159
then it makes it seem like
no one cares about them,

616
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,412
which sends the
message that you can

617
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,789
violate them
without any repercussion.

618
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,000
You have something
you want to say to me?

619
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,085
I just said it.

620
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,427
Hello.

621
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,346
What are you doing here?

622
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,473
This is for you.

623
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,351
What's that?

624
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,351
Wheatgrass.

625
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,353
When did you get so healthy?

626
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,523
Oh, not me. I got a
double shot of espresso.

627
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,692
But for you, I got
the most disgusting thing

628
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,235
I could find
on the menu.

629
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,528
I figured you'll love it.

630
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,864
What are you really doing here?

631
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,325
The DNA results came back.

632
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:02,495
Belong to a Malcolm Scott,
known drug dealer and drug user.

633
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,206
He's in prison for
two other murders.

634
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,208
Anything else?

635
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,336
The gun in the two other
murders he's in for

636
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,255
matches the gun that
killed Muhammad Akin.

637
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,424
So Darnell is innocent.

638
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,551
Looks that way.

639
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,414
Do I need a lawyer?

640
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,250
If you need your lawyer, we'll
get your lawyer down here.

641
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,752
Am I being charged?

642
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,254
Not yet. We can talk first

643
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,422
and hear your side of things.

644
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,590
Yeah.

645
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,842
This is more of a courtesy.

646
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,095
What are you talking about?

647
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,095
We wanted

648
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,055
to extend you the courtesy
of letting you know

649
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:07,060
that the charges against you
will now include murder.

650
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,937
I never killed anyone
in my life.

651
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,438
You might not have meant
to kill anyone,

652
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,273
but you definitely
killed someone.

653
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,401
You're talking out your ass.

654
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,195
Maybe so.

655
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,406
But we got security camera
footage of your work truck

656
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,990
at the location of the murder.

657
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,535
We know you committed these
crimes while you were working

658
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,286
because you figured
that would be your alibi.

659
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,372
And after all, who's gonna
believe the testimony

660
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,416
of a bunch of frail
old people, right?

661
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,251
But the jury's
gonna be out

662
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,003
on you causing the death
of a young mother.

663
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,630
Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh.

664
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,590
I never targeted a young person.

665
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,300
We believe
you didn't mean to kill her,

666
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,094
but you busted
into her apartment,

667
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,471
you knocked her on the ground,
she hit her head on the ground

668
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,473
and unfortunately,

669
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,475
she died, so that's murder.

670
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,436
I never went
into anyone's apartment.

671
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,478
Fits your M.O.

672
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,147
And now she's dead.

673
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,231
Yep.

674
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,316
I never killed nobody.

675
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,444
There you go again
with the double negatives.

676
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,444
Come on

677
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,445
stop confusing me.

678
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,780
Okay. How about I make it
real easy for you?

679
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,283
The D.A. wants to charge you
with murder.

680
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,369
We don't want to charge you
with murder.

681
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,540
That's right.

682
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,041
I never killed nobody.

683
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,502
I never killed anyone.

684
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,504
Right.

685
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,504
I swear.

686
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,339
Good. Then how about this?

687
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,342
You give us a list of the people
that you did victimize,

688
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,511
and we'll make sure
that you're only charged

689
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,680
for the crimes
that you did commit.

690
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:27,474
The robberies.

691
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,392
And not the murder

692
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,936
of this young mother.

693
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,281
Okay.

694
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:47,035
Deal.

695
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,953
Great.

696
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,371
You were right.

697
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,582
He is smart.

698
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,104
A Reagan in a crisis
of conscience

699
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:18,566
always goes to one
place, and I, uh...

700
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,444
I happen to know that
this is your favorite one.

701
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,743
How are you doing?

702
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:32,121

The truth?

703
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,750
If I was Darnell,

704
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,419
and I was separated from Nicky
for the first five years

705
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,214
of her life, I'm not sure
I could ever get over it.

706
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:44,384
No, you're the strongest woman
that I know.

707
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:48,680
God, I wish I was as tough
as everyone thinks I am.

708
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,597
You know,

709
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,267
you can ask for help sometimes.

710
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,521
What do you think
I'm doing here?

711
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,068
I think that you should
talk to Darnell.

712
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:06,281
The last time I spoke to him,
he told me to go to hell.

713
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,366
Never stopped you
from talking to me.

714
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,162
Erin, I will go with you.

715
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,624
It's my case,
it's my responsibility.

716
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,961
You are such a Reagan sometimes.

717
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,463
And you say that
like it's a bad thing.

718
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,549
Yeah, sometimes it is.

719
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,676
You know,

720
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,597
I even started to feel bad
that I brought this case to you.

721
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,017
And then I thought,
"No, this case is a gift."

722
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,478
Well, can I please return it?

723
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,315
You have been given a chance

724
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,193
to fix something
before it is too late.

725
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,322
And that is something
to be grateful for.

726
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,368
So, you're welcome.

727
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,101
I feel like I'm just
gonna go with the burger.

728
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,229
Are you even
listening to me?

729
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,229
Mm-hmm.

730
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,273
Please don't tell me
you agree with my dad.

731
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,651
You're mad at your dad
because you feel

732
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,320
like he treats you different,
he expects more from you

733
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,197
and he's too righteous.

734
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,116
He holds all of you
to a really high moral standard.

735
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,911
S-So?

736
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:39,040
Jamie, he challenges you
to be a better person.

737
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:43,127
And, if I'm being honest,
I kind of love that about him.

738
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,140
Just pick out the photos
of the people you victimized

739
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,227
and you won't be charged with
any crimes you didn't commit.

740
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,895
Or a murder you didn't commit.

741
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,563
Right.

742
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,026
That young woman
that got killed,

743
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,612
what was her name?

744
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,612
Evelyn...

745
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,072
Campbell.

746
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,031
But I already gave you my word.

747
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,741
You're not gonna be charged
with her murder.

748
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,827
Okay.

749
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,581
So, just assault and robbery?

750
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,959
You'll only be charged with
the crimes that you committed

751
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,378
against the people
you victimized.

752
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,508
Okay.

753
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,096
Him.

754
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,431
Mm-hmm.

755
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,892
Her.

756
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,396
Her.

757
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,864
And... her.

758
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,324
Mrs. Harton.

759
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,035
Are you sure about that?

760
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,706
Yeah. I'm sure.

761
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,127
I'll come find you after
he signs his confession.

762
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,129
I look forward to it.

763
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,133
Numbers are
on the back.

764
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,136
Write down their names and what
you did to them and sign it.

765
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,597
Okay.

766
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,435
Evelyn Campbell?
Your fourth grade teacher?

767
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,645
You know, I never
really liked Ms. Campbell.

768
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,231
She used to pull
on my ear a lot.

769
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,609
Well, that was a particularly
good bluff.

770
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,609
Hmm.

771
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,652
You didn't promise that he
wouldn't be charged with murder,

772
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,196
you promised he would
only be charged

773
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,156
with the crimes he did commit.

774
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,491
Yep. And right now,

775
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,534
he thinks his victim
Mrs. Harton is still alive.

776
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,994
Once he finishes

777
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:42,830
signing the confession,
I'll let him know she died

778
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,999
and... we'll charge him
with murder.

779
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,125
Simple.

780
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,170
Well, you're really good
at your job, Detective Reagan.

781
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,881
Can I buy you
a drink after work?

782
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,881
No.

783
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:56,135
I can't. I've got some
broken windows to repair.

784
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,512

Right.

785
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,263
Good luck.

786
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,245
Hi.

787
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,580
Hey.

788
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:31,254
In my job,

789
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:35,675
99.9% of the
people I prosecute

790
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,885
say they're innocent.

791
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,722
During your trial, and really,
up until quite recently,

792
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,392
I was convinced that
you were guilty.

793
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:48,396
Everything pointed that way.

794
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:52,191
The evidence,
Chantal's testimony.

795
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,321
So, yeah, you were right.

796
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:01,325
I did not believe you
when you said you were innocent.

797
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,248
But I do now.

798
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:13,212
I am recommending
that you be exonerated.

799
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,046
I plan on being

800
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,801
in court to set
the record straight.

801
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,429
Other than that,
there's really not much I can do

802
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:25,141
to make up for the lost time.

803
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,440
To say I'm sorry
just feels so little

804
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,526
in light of what
you've been through.

805
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:47,330
I just hope that somewhere
down the line, you...

806
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,128
...find it in your heart
to forgive me.

807
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,107
My lawyer told me that

808
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:20,029
if I hold on to this hate
and resentment,

809
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:24,283
the rest of my life will be
just as much a prison sentence

810
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,203
as the last five years
have been.

811
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,295
I forgive you.

812
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,574
Thank you.

813
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,259
We are gonna get started

814
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,094
with what we call
the fast round.

815
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:28,222
The first team to shout the
correct answer gets one token.

816
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,890
Five tokens
gets you a free round.

817
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,393
Yes!

818
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,393
Why did you
pick this place?

819
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,104
We'll kick their butts
together, okay? Um...

820
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,648
Two, uh, Finnerty's
on the rocks, please.

821
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,108
Thank you.

822
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,110
So how'd your case go?

823
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,029
Great. We got the perp
to confess.

824
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,447
Question one.

825
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,742
You go ahead. I-I-I'll
sit this one out.

826
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,368
Well, suit yourself.

827
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,246
Which U.S. President had a home
called "The Hermitage"?

828
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,123
Andrew Jackson.
Andrew Jackson!

829
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,876
That's right. Give team...

830
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,462
Uh, Flatfoot.

831
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,462
Flatfoot.

832
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,464
Team Flatfoot a token
over there.

833
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,341
Not for nothing,

834
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,594
but I thought you were
gonna sit this round out.

835
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,138
Beginner's luck.

836
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,138
Ah, right.

837
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,474
Second question.
In which movie

838
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,434
did Humphrey Bogart
play Charlie...

839
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,436
African Queen.

840
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,436
That's right.

841
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,105
Another token
for Team Flatfoot.

842
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,484
Maybe I'm pretty good
at this after all.

843
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,484
You think?

844
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,863
You're a regular ringer, Gramps.

845
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,573
You were worried about me,

846
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,992
didn't want me to feel like
I was losing it.

847
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,828
Hmm. Is it working?

848
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,955
Hell yeah.

849
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,166
All right.

850
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:59,605
You mind?

851
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,774
It's a free country.

852
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,152
How long you been here?

853
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,989
Oh, since 4:30.

854
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,491
Looking for bass?

855
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,494
They're more active
before the light comes up.

856
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,704
Get any bites?

857
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,748
Caught a six pound
striper,

858
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:21,460
but he was
pretty beat up.

859
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,962
I know the feeling.

860
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,634
You're using silversides.

861
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:32,555
Always prepared.

862
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:37,309
Not for everything,
as this last week pointed out.

863
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,356
You knew how I'd react.

864
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:43,524
I didn't.

865
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,317
Yeah, you did.

866
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:49,363
Seconds before or after,

867
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:52,199
but you were gonna do
what you were gonna do,

868
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,535
or defend what you did.

869
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:58,330
I'm always gonna do the job
the way that I see fit.

870
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,505
Pop told me you'd be here.

871
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,017
In response to you asking?

872
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:29,528
Same situation, I might've
done the same thing.

873
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,071
Might've.

874
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,741
Would have. You were a sergeant

875
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,409
and they were cops
in your house.

876
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:38,579
Might have.

877
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,247
Times were different then.

878
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,584
And maybe going along
with the times

879
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,253
isn't always the wisest thing.

880
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,465
I'm a sergeant
and I-I want to set an example,

881
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,509
climate be damned.

882
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,763
Same goes for me, too.

883
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,806
Is that why I got a two-day rip?

884
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,436
I have to hold you
to a higher standard.

885
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,608
And climate be damned.

886

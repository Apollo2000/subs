1
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:22,239
Mrs. Davis?

2
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:23,501
Uh, yes.

3
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:25,155
Detective Reagan.

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,376
I understand you had an incident
with your ex-husband?

5
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:29,681
Warren and I are separated.

6
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:32,249
I served him with divorce papers
this morning.

7
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:33,468
Okay. So what happened?

8
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:37,298
Uh, he came over, um,
screaming, crying.

9
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:39,430
I probably shouldn't
have let him in,

10
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:41,476
but I thought I could reason
with him.

11
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:43,043
Did he put his hands on you?

12
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,479
No. No, no, um...

13
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,350
But he said there's no way

14
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:48,613
he'd ever let me
tear our family apart.

15
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:50,485
I see.

16
00:00:53,227 --> 00:00:54,924
You didn't have
to call the police, Mom.

17
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:57,840
This is our son, Andrew.Dad was just upset.

18
00:00:57,883 --> 00:00:59,581
Doesn't give him the right
to threaten you guys.

19
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:01,713
I gotta go.

20
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:09,069
It's gotta be tough on him.

21
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,941
It is.

22
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:14,639
I wish it didn't have to be
this way.

23
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:17,686
Yeah, I understand.
Um, I also understand

24
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,992
that, uh,
Children's Services assigned

25
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:22,212
an investigative consultant
to your case, is that right?

26
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:23,387
Uh, yes.

27
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:26,216
He's been incredibly supportive.

28
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,217
Um...

29
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:28,871
This is him now.

30
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,745
Morning, Detective.

31
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,408
Hey, that fits
the description

32
00:01:44,452 --> 00:01:46,367
of the vehicle wanted
in connection

33
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,064
with the double homicide
in the Bronx last night.

34
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,066
Good eye.
Run the plate.

35
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,024
Brandon Phelps.

36
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:54,505
Registration expired
two months ago.

37
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:56,116
Let's go.

38
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:19,791
Registration's
expired, Brandon.

39
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:22,054
So write me a ticket
and let me get out of here.

40
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,188
Do me a favor,
lower this rear window.

41
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:29,801
Now put your hands back
on the wheel, please.

42
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:44,729
What've we got
here, Brandon?

43
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:46,557
No idea what that is.We're gonna need

44
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:47,993
to search the vehicle.

45
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:49,430
Step out of the car.

46
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:51,345
Now.

47
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,216
Let's go.

48
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,436
Put your hands
on the car.

49
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:09,406
.38 caliber revolver.

50
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,495
What was the caliber gun used
in those shootings last night?

51
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,584
.38 Put your hands
behind your back.

52
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:16,283
What a coincidence.I didn't shoot nobody.

53
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:17,414
Guess we'll find out.

54
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,242
Good eye, Janko.

55
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:21,853
Real good eye.

56
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:24,682
Let's go.

57
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:31,863
Okay. How did it start?

58
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:34,388
As a typical noise complaint.

59
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:36,999
Restaurant manager said
he asked the group in question

60
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:40,089
to quiet down repeatedly
before calling 911.

61
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:41,656
And there were calls
from the neighbors

62
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,092
about what had spilled out
onto the sidewalk.

63
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:44,267
So a pretty
rowdy group

64
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:46,878
that was really
getting out of hand.

65
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:50,708
But also chock-full
of FDNY brass.

66
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:53,537
Responding officers did not have
that information.

67
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:58,499
And when did our guys ascertain
that information?

68
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:01,502
No way to know that,
specifically.

69
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:05,723
Maybe when they pulled up
and clocked the FDNY badges

70
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:09,640
and plates on the vehicles
in front of the restaurant?

71
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:11,686
Could be.

72
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,688
Was exactly.

73
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:15,864
Point being, our guys
did not arrive on the scene

74
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:18,910
with any intent other
than to quell the disturbance.

75
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:21,261
Yet, somehow,

76
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:24,873
they managed
to arrest Stan Rourke.

77
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,831
Well, yeah.

78
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,704
 Yeah, well,
that's pretty resourceful,

79
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:31,183
I'll give us that.

80
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:33,664
Turning a noise complaint
about a retirement racket

81
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,668
into collaring
the FDNY commissioner.

82
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:41,281
Boss, all the eyewitnesses said
the exact same thing.

83
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:43,457
Our guy was appealing
to Commissioner Rourke

84
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,894
who responded by laying hands
on our guy.

85
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:48,940
Watch out, Sid, there's
an elephant in the room.

86
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,725
"Our" guys, "their" guys.

87
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:53,641
This has been going on
as long as I've been a cop.

88
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:55,773
Again, boss,
our guys didn't start this.

89
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:58,080
No, but it just might be

90
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,561
our guys poured gasoline on it.

91
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:07,698
A.D.A. Erin Reagan.

92
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,702
Thanks so much for coming up.

93
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:13,008
Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Mayor.

94
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:14,662
Mayor-elect.

95
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:16,533
Mr. Mayor-elect.

96
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:18,143
How about just Peter?

97
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:19,275
Peter.

98
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,798
Please.

99
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,024
So, congratulations.

100
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:30,547
Yeah, thanks.

101
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:33,158
I liked a lot of what you
had to say on the campaign.

102
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:35,247
Some of which was true...

103
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,162
and some of which
was a combination

104
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:39,774
of pandering
and wishful thinking.

105
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:41,863
And which was which?

106
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:43,778
Doesn't matter, I got the job.

107
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:46,389
So now all of it has to be true.

108
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,260
Right.

109
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:50,785
Which is why I've asked you up.

110
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:53,570
Gulp.

111
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:56,181
Nah. It's all good.

112
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,924
I don't like your boss's bent.

113
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:03,798
I didn't know
my boss had a bent.

114
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:06,496
He thinks accused criminals

115
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,281
and their victims
both have equal rights.

116
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:11,153
They don't have equal rights.

117
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:13,503
They are both protected
under the law.

118
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:15,723
Yes, and rightly so.

119
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,986
But he gets lost in the weeds.

120
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:22,512
I don't think your office
has the trust that it should.

121
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:23,731
The people's trust?

122
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:24,732
That's our customer.

123
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:25,776
That's who we serve.

124
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,822
Well, we serve the law,
actually.

125
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:29,345
That, too.

126
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,739
But don't forget the customer.

127
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:37,397
I'd like to support your run
for Manhattan district attorney.

128
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:40,965
I...
I don't have a run.

129
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,750
You do now, if you want.

130
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:44,142
With the mayor's backing.

131
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:45,361
The mayor-elect.

132
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,624
In a month and a half, mayor.

133
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:50,279
By a landslide.

134
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,847
You're gonna get a call
from Sam Terhune.

135
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,806
He's been with me since day one.

136
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,722
Have the coffee, hear him out,
share your concerns.

137
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:02,160
Well, my first concern is that
I am loyal to my office,

138
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:03,727
and you're asking me to...

139
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:06,382
Stay loyal to your office.

140
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,472
Mr. Chatwal is not the office.

141
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:12,519
He's just the guy sitting
in it for now.

142
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:40,764
I didn't even know
you were working

143
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:42,157
with Child Services,
Gramps.

144
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,941
Their high-risk caseload's
gone through the roof.

145
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:46,248
Well, it's pretty
smart of ACS

146
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,468
to reach out to retired
cops, I'll say that much.

147
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,558
Well, they need the help,
I got the time.
Right.

148
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:53,211
So, this Davis guy,
you met him?

149
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:56,301
Does he pose any threat
to his wife and kid?

150
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:57,520
Warren's a decent guy.

151
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,522
Decent guy?

152
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:02,003
He just did eight months
in state prison.

153
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,355
He ran a nursing home
in Queens.
Uh-huh.

154
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:07,922
He got hooked
on pain meds,
Mm-hmm.

155
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:10,315
and then he started stealing
the pills from the residents.

156
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:14,058
Not for nothing, that doesn't
exactly sound like a decent guy.

157
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:16,365
He made a mistake,
he paid for it.

158
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:18,802
Now he's fighting
to keep his family alive.

159
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:20,587
Sounds like that
ship already sailed.

160
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,589
You know where
I can find him?

161
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:25,287
Yeah. Warren's parole officer
got him a job in a drug rehab.

162
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,723
Great. Give me the address,

163
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,769
and I'll drop you off at home
on my way to see him.

164
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:29,944
Fat chance.

165
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:33,469
I'm working this case
same as you.

166
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,562
Okay.

167
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:44,567
Hey.

168
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:46,656
So I go
to this joker's apartment.

169
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,832
Turns out he's not
just dating the victim,

170
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:51,400
he's dating
her sister, too.

171
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,010
Uh-huh.

172
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:55,926
And the sister, oh,
she's got a full-face tattoo

173
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,625
of the Pope and Mother Teresa
riding a Harley.

174
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,278
Yeah. Got it.

175
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:01,758
You haven't heard
a word I said.

176
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:03,107
What's going on with you?

177
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:05,457
Just...

178
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:13,030
I met with Mayor-elect Chase
this morning.

179
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:15,990
He wants to support me in a run
for the D.A.'s office.

180
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,295
Shut the front door.

181
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:18,296
I know.

182
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,384
And what'd you tell him?

183
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:20,603
Well, I didn't say much
of anything.

184
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:23,606
Well, including "no"?I listened, mostly.

185
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,608
Yeah, but no "no."There are a hundred reasons

186
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,610
why this is a bad idea.

187
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:28,742
Yeah. And one good one.

188
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,439
'Cause you'd be a kick-ass D.A.

189
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:31,745
Thank you.

190
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,268
But if I put my hat in the ring,

191
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:35,096
this whole office
will go upside down.

192
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:37,794
The boss is gonna come after you
with both barrels.

193
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:39,622
Well, I can handle him.
Problem is,

194
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,103
he's gonna force everyone
in the building to choose sides.

195
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:43,452
Yeah, well, you have
a hell of a lot more friends

196
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:44,671
around here than he does.

197
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:47,195
But do I have what it takes
to beat him?

198
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,980
Only one way to find out.

199
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:52,679
Yeah. The hard way.

200
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:04,386
Hey. Nice work out
there this morning.

201
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:05,953
Thanks, Sarge.Oh, thanks.
That gun

202
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:07,694
you got out of that car
looks good for the murder weapon

203
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:09,696
used in that double homicide
up in the Bronx.

204
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:11,045
That's great news.Phelps gets charged

205
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:12,176
for the murders,
could be a commendation in it

206
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,569
for both of you.

207
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,397
Just happy to take a mutt
like that off the street.

208
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,838
Hey.
Huh?

209
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:23,274
What?

210
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:24,449
Nothing.

211
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:26,060
Something.

212
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:28,715
We got a bad guy.

213
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,847
What could be the matter?

214
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:49,692
Thank you, Lieutenant.

215
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:55,829
You're gonna pay for this,
you son of a bitch.

216
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:57,395
No, I'm not.

217
00:10:57,439 --> 00:11:00,529
Your guys targeted my racket
to bust our balls!

218
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,400
They responded
to a noise complaint.

219
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:06,187
Instead of dialing it down,
you chose to get belligerent.

220
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,536
That's not how it went down.

221
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:09,494
That's exactly how it went down.

222
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,061
Oh, you can't whitewash this,
Frank my guys have

223
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:12,715
the whole thing
on their phones, you know.

224
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,413
Yeah, I saw 'em.
You laid hands on my cop.

225
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:16,806
I stuck my finger in his chest.

226
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,896
You jabbed your finger
in his chest repeatedly.

227
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,725
To make a point!They had every right
to haul you in.

228
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,814
Because you license your guys
to harass us.

229
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,511
The hell I do.Oh, come on, Frank,

230
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:29,210
your guys stick it to my guys
every chance they get.

231
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:31,821
NYPD can't stand
that we get all the glory.

232
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:34,215
Oh, while we grind it out
and do our job.

233
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:35,956
Your guys targeted me.

234
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,479
That's the fact.

235
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,481
My guys responded by the book.

236
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,875
That's... the fact.

237
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:47,837
I am the commissioner
of the FDNY.

238
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:51,014
Which is why you weren't cuffed
when we hauled you in here.

239
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:52,799
Cut the crap, Stan.

240
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:56,933
Summons for harassment.

241
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:59,283
You're free to go.

242
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:04,854
You haven't heard
the last of this, Frank.

243
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:14,777
You were supposed to call me
before reaching out to Karen.

244
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:17,388
I know.
It's just the, uh...

245
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:19,695
divorce papers, uh,

246
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,001
they caught me off guard.

247
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:22,829
Doesn't give you a right
to threaten your family.

248
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:24,961
You're right.
I lost my head.

249
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:27,181
You staying clean?Absolutely.

250
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:29,792
Warren's P.O. says
he's been the model parolee.

251
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:32,055
Well, I'm sure his soon-to-be
ex-wife would say different.

252
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,491
Well, I put Karen through a lot.

253
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,363
I don't blame her
if she gives up on me.

254
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,017
So why the meltdown today?

255
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,583
Look...

256
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,805
I can live
with losing my marriage,

257
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:45,242
but not my son
he means everything to me.

258
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,680
You gonna tell
my parole officer?

259
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:49,812
What do you think?

260
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:51,248
No one got hurt.

261
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:59,822
Fine.

262
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:01,824
I won't tell him this time.

263
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,260
But no more shenanigans.

264
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,001
You've got my word.

265
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:10,528
Thank you.

266
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,226
What was that?What was what?

267
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:13,836
You guys were
acting all chummy.

268
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,230
You acted like more of a
social worker than a cop.

269
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:18,841
I'm not here as a cop.
My job is to get

270
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:20,843
the best possible outcome
for this family.

271
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,759
Well, my job is
to enforce the law.

272
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,982
You've gone over
that arrest report

273
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:31,114
a dozen times.

274
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:33,116
Troy asks the suspect
to lower the rear window,

275
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,815
and there was a single vial
right there on the seat.

276
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,077
So?

277
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,993
No drugs on him
or anywhere else in the car.

278
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,995
Again, so?

279
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,561
So it's pretty convenient.

280
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:47,522
Drug dealers have been known
to carry drugs, Jamie.

281
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:49,524
In plain view on the back seat?

282
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,222
So he was careless.

283
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:55,617
And we did find a gun
that killed two people.

284
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,271
So there's that.

285
00:13:57,314 --> 00:14:00,056
When Troy reached in the car, he
turned so that his body camera

286
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,492
faced away from the vehicle.

287
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:02,972
Are you sure
you didn't see anything?

288
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:06,410
I saw Troy reaching in the back
and pulling out a vial,

289
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,978
and that gave us cause
to search a vehicle

290
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:11,111
that had a gun under the seat

291
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,765
that was used
in a double homicide.

292
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:16,812
That's all you saw?

293
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,207
With these two eyes, yes.

294
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,383
Okay, pretend
it's two years ago.

295
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:25,081
You and I are still riding
together as partners,

296
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,604
both of us on that scene.

297
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:28,693
What else might one of us
have noticed?

298
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:33,916
If Troy played fast
and loose with this,

299
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,918
it's gonna come out.How?

300
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:37,746
Because if I can't get
to the bottom of it,

301
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:38,921
I have to make a phone call.

302
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,533
Wha...
Whoa, you're gonna call IAB?

303
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:44,057
If I suspect
a collar is bad, Eddie,

304
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,189
it is my job to call IAB.Even if it

305
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,582
lets a perp walk?

306
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,106
And jams me up in the process?

307
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,194
You'll be just fine.And so will

308
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:52,717
the perp.

309
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:55,285
Fine and dandy
out on the street.

310
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:00,029
I can't look the other way
on this.

311
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:07,950
You are notgoing
to take him, okay?

312
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,778
Calm down, for God's sake.I did everything

313
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:11,171
I was supposed to do!Calm down, Warren.

314
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:12,955
Hey! Hey, hey!
Settle down!Why are you doing this?

315
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,130
Settle down!

316
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:15,784
Shut your mouth
and settle down.Danny...

317
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:17,003
Please...
What the hell

318
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:18,047
is going on here?

319
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:21,094
Karen got a job offer in L.A.

320
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:24,053
She told Andrew,
who texted his dad.

321
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:25,228
I'm sorry, Warren.

322
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:26,577
I didn't want you
to find out like this.

323
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:27,709
You're not taking my son!

324
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:29,667
Hey! Hey!

325
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:32,192
Dad! Please! Don't hurt him.It's okay.
Nobody's gonna hurt him.

326
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:34,759
Let me talk to him.No, no.

327
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:36,761
We're done talking.
Get him out of here.

328
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:41,723
Get him out of here.
Come on.

329
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:44,204
It's okay, Andy. It's okay.

330
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:46,510
Go.
It's okay.

331
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:48,034
It's okay, Andy.
It's okay, Andy.

332
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,574
I gave you a break,

333
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:09,490
but you just couldn't leave
well enough alone, could you?

334
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,058
I needed to talk to Karen.

335
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,320
You call that talking?

336
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:16,540
Look, you have to put yourself
in my place.

337
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:20,718
She's trying to drag my son
across the country.Well,

338
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:23,504
even if a judge allows that,
you-you get yourself a lawyer,

339
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:26,463
you work out a custody situation
that you can live with.

340
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,988
I'm a convicted felon.

341
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,033
What kind of custody deal
am I gonna get?

342
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:34,036
I don't know. But that's
the least of your worries now.

343
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:39,041
Do you think they're
gonna send me back to jail?

344
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,174
Well, you sure as hell
would deserve it.

345
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,050
What's going on?

346
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,574
Got Warren's
desk appearance ticket.

347
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:57,190
That mutt deserves
to stay locked up

348
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,018
until his parole
violation hearing.

349
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,497
Disagree.He's an ex-con

350
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,326
with a drug problem who
threatened his family, and now

351
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,067
he just bought himself
an order of protection.

352
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,373
He screwed up.

353
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,114
Now he's trying
to set things right.Okay,

354
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:11,073
but you can't go ballistic
every time you get a bad break.

355
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:12,379

Look who's talking.

356
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:15,295

This guy is not a perp.

357
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:18,341
He's trying to save his family.

358
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:24,956
Cut him loose.

359
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:29,048
You take one step out of line,
I'm gonna be there,

360
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,919
and I'm gonna bust your ass!

361
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,061
Thank you.

362
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:46,239
The arresting officer,
Bruce Zarrelli,

363
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:48,067
is an 11-year veteran

364
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,112
with a clean and
solid record.

365
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:51,331
There you go.

366
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:53,594
Except for being named
in a complaint

367
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:56,075
a couple of years back
in a brawl

368
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,642
between NYPD officers
and firefighters

369
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,122
that broke out in
the emergency room

370
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,124
where they were being treated
at St. Luke's.

371
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,125
What are the chances?

372
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,474
Of what?Well,

373
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:08,565
another run-in with the FDNY
out of 35,000 cops?

374
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,567
Zarrelli also coaches
youth hockey

375
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:13,135
for the Police Sports League's
program.

376
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:15,398
He gives back. See?

377
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:17,139
And?

378
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:22,101
Andplays as a defenseman
for the NYPD's hockey squad.

379
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,060
And?

380
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,671
In three of the last five

381
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:30,718
NYPD-versus-FDNY
annual hockey games,

382
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:34,156
he's been ejected
for misconduct.

383
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,288
For fighting.

384
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:40,162
 It's hockey;
it's a contact sport.

385
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:42,164
This supports Rourke's claim
that he was singled out.

386
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,948
Rourke laid on hands,
not our guy.

387
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,211
The collar was solid.

388
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:46,473
That's not how it's
gonna read in the papers.

389
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:49,084
Any way you slice it,
Rourke still messed up.

390
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,304
Any way you slice it, so did we.

391
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:57,614
Mayor Chase and I
only met yesterday.

392
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:59,181
He thought it went well.

393
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:00,835
He gave a review?

394
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,184
You confirmed his opinion of you

395
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:04,143
based on our research,
that's all.

396
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,796
Oh.
If it seems
like he flies

397
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,755
by the seat of his pants,
he doesn't.

398
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:10,149
No, I...He just finds it useful
to give that impression.

399
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:15,154
I haven't made a decision.

400
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,677
It's been a day.
I'd hope not.

401
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:19,201
Right.

402
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:21,812
So why am I here?

403
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,945
Because Peter Chase thinks
you'd make a great D.A.,

404
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:25,990
and I've been in the room
since day one.

405
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:28,254
What is day one, by the way?First store he opened.

406
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:29,907
While he was cutting
the ribbon out front,

407
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:32,606
I was out back still duking
it out with the Teamsters boss.

408
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:35,261
And your research on me,
what does it say?

409
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:36,871
Top of the waves?

410
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:39,221
A lot of positives
with one big unknown.

411
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:40,657
What is that?

412
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,442
Do you want it and how badly.

413
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:44,052
I don't know that yet.

414
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:45,096
I knew that

415
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,707
from the moment we shook hands.

416
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,450
Do you have any advice for me?

417
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:52,147
What kind?

418
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,018
What kinds are there?It boils down

419
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:56,020
to what you want to hear
and what you need to hear.

420
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,500

Okay.

421
00:19:57,544 --> 00:19:59,546
What I need to hear.

422
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:03,202
I'm a car guy.

423
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,030
Family and friends, they come
to me when it's that time.

424
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:07,858
One thing I always tell them...

425
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:09,295
Okay?

426
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:12,254
Never buy the first year
of a new model's production.

427
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:15,344
Wait at least
until the second cycle.

428
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:18,304
I've got a car I like.

429
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:19,609
Exactly.

430
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:22,221
You've got a good job
and one you excel in.

431
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,875
Peter Chase as mayor
is still a month and a half

432
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:26,355
from the showroom floor.

433
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:27,835
You'd be buying into something

434
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:30,925
no one's had the chance
to even drive around the block.

435
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,236
You're in early.

436
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,889
Got a call from IAB.

437
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,326
I figured you would.

438
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,415
They're investigating
the Phelps collar.

439
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,633
I'm getting called in.

440
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:45,592
Like I said, just
tell the truth.

441
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:47,420
The truth is

442
00:20:47,463 --> 00:20:49,596
that a really bad guy's
off the streets.

443
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:51,598
But that's the
result, Eddie.

444
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:53,687
The question is
how it went down.

445
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,384
I don't want
to jam anybody up.

446
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:56,864
I get that. But
if the evidence

447
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:59,083
that allowed Troy to search
that car was planted...

448
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:01,477
I don't know that it was,
and neither do you.

449
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:04,393
You don't know,
but you have doubts.

450
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:07,440
What I have is
my partner's back.

451
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:08,745
Just like I had yours.

452
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,660
The difference is I
never crossed the line.

453
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:13,576
Kenneth Troy is a good cop.Even good cops screw up.

454
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,231
So we're just gonna
let him hang out to dry?

455
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,842
If Troy broke the law, then
he needs to answer for that,

456
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:20,888
same as the alleged
shooter that you collared.

457
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:22,455
Well, no, it's not the same.

458
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:24,108
Phelps is a murderer.

459
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:27,416
And Troy has given his life
to this department.

460
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,852
You're right.
It's not the same.

461
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:30,245
Troy's worse.

462
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,595
Well, how do you figure that?

463
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,162
Because he took an oath.

464
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,338
Because when you put on the
uniform, you ask the public

465
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:38,601
to entrust you with
upholding the law,

466
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,908
so you should know better.

467
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:45,086
The same goes for anyone
who covers for him.

468
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:54,878
Detective Reagan,
what are you doing here?

469
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:56,489
I could ask you
the same thing.

470
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:58,229
You do realize
you're in violation

471
00:21:58,273 --> 00:21:59,535
of the order of
protection, correct?

472
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:01,972
No, no, no. I got a message
from Karen at work,

473
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:03,365
and she asked me
to come over.

474
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:04,540
I'm sure she did.

475
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,499
I'm serious.
You got to believe me.

476
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:07,804
Doesn't matter what I believe.

477
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:09,110
You're under arrest. Let's go.

478
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:10,285
Hands against the car.

479
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,460
What are you...?Just go.

480
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,462
Right now!

481
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:21,078
Turn around.

482
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:23,124
Stay right here.

483
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:28,042
Let me guess. You just happened
to be in the neighborhood?

484
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:31,132
Warren texted me,
said Karen wanted to meet.

485
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:34,483
I called Karen,
she knew nothing about it.

486
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,833
Yeah, sounds like
your boy made it up.

487
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:38,400
Or someone sent a fake message

488
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:40,620
so he'd violate
his order of protection.

489
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:42,056
Well, that sounds like something

490
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:43,884
you'dprobably do
back in your glory days.

491
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:45,407
More than once.

492
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:47,366
But setting people up
is the kind of thing

493
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:48,845
you can get busted for.

494
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:50,847
Is that a threat?

495
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:53,372
You take him in based
on a fixed setup?

496
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,417
It's a promise.

497
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,815
Okay.

498
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:04,295
But if he kills his wife,
it's on you.

499
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:07,864
Get the hell out of here. Now!

500
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:09,431
Stay away.

501
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:20,050
When?

502
00:23:20,094 --> 00:23:21,617
About an hour
and a half ago.

503
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:24,446
Apparently, both our guys and
their guys started jawboning

504
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,536
at each other, but the
bosses on scene got ahold

505
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,016
before anything physical
started.

506
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:31,410
And we can assume
that the cell phones were out

507
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:34,456
and that the jawboning'll be
all bleeps on the 5:00 news.

508
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,459
I got nothing but bleeps
for this right now. But they were able

509
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:40,419
to secure the scene together
without any real incident?Yes.

510
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,986
Yeah. This time.

511
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,554
Look, walk down the street,

512
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:48,035
and ask anyone the name
of the police commissioner

513
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:49,950
and the fire commissioner,
what do you get?

514
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:50,994
"Frank Reagan,"

515
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:52,039
and, "I don't know."

516
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:53,562
Exactly. Look,
I'd have a chip

517
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:56,260
on my shoulder, too, if I was
"Commissioner I Don't Know."

518
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:58,262
So would any of you.So what?

519
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:00,656
Well, Lieutenant, we are going

520
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,878
to do something about this thing
with our guys and their guys

521
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:07,707
before it spills out
onto the street.

522
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,666
Okay, but what about our guy?Our hockey player?

523
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,668
Yeah. We gonna just let him
hang out to dry?

524
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:14,975
This tradition

525
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:18,761
I know the rank and file likes
to play it on both sides

526
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:20,589
but I got nothing for it.

527
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:22,765
So... what?

528
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,985
We ask him
to take one for the team.

529
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:26,987
You've been

530
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,467
interviewed
with IAB before.

531
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,513
Yeah, but not with my
partner's career on the line.

532
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:33,950
You should be worried
about your own career here.

533
00:24:33,994 --> 00:24:36,213
I have you to
thank for that.

534
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:37,519
I did my job, Eddie.

535
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:39,173
And it could cost me mine.

536
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:41,001
IAB is looking
at Troy, not you.

537
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:42,785
Like that matters.Of course it matters.

538
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:46,180
Really? I tell IAB the truth
I didn't see anything

539
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:49,183
and Troy still goes down,
I come out smelling like a rat.

540
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:52,142
Maybe to a few knuckleheads.

541
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:57,060
Troy has been in that
precinct for 12 years, Jamie.

542
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:59,976
If he loses his shield,
they're gonna blame that on me.

543
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,500
I did not create
the situation, Eddie.

544
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:02,979
I did not plant that evidence.

545
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:05,286
You just called IAB.

546
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,476
Hey.

547
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,869
Hey.

548
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,876
Is everything all right?

549
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,140
Yeah, just...
work stuff.

550
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:35,534
Work stuff about
you running for D.A.?

551
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:39,102
How did you find out?

552
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:41,931
Hey, I know guys who know guys.

553
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:44,586
I thought it was
supposed to be confidential.

554
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,109
Well, by normal
standards, it is,

555
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:49,156
but one guy knew one
other guy who knew.

556
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:53,943
I wanted to come
to you with it right away.

557
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:56,076
But you didn't.

558
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:58,078
I just felt like
it was a decision

559
00:25:58,121 --> 00:25:59,688
I should make on my own.

560
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,691
And I respect that.

561
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,217
I've wanted this my whole life.

562
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:09,002
Actually, you wanted
to be a jockey

563
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:10,786
till you were nine years old.

564
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,788
Well, I was already
five-seven by then.

565
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:14,311
And allergic to horses.

566
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:18,228
Okay, I have wanted this
my entire adultlife.

567
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:22,276
And it's past time
that Manhattan has a female D.A.

568
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,279
Well, I think
you'd make a great one.

569
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:26,802
Nothing to do with gender.

570
00:26:26,846 --> 00:26:28,848
Thank you.

571
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:30,893
Yeah.

572
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:34,418
Something to think about.

573
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:36,246
It is

574
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,119
definitely gonna
turn up the heat around here.

575
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:41,251
I thought you and I have done
a good job

576
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:43,645
checking our guns at the door
since I became bureau chief.

577
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:45,473
Yes,

578
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:47,606
but there is the rest
of the family.

579
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,174
What do you mean?

580
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:53,655
Well, they've lived
in the public eye

581
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:55,614
for as long as I can remember,

582
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,659
but you choose to stand

583
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:59,618
for public office.

584
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:04,013
The scrutiny will go
through the roof. I know.

585
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:06,494
Look, it's your decision,

586
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:08,627
as it should be.

587
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,326
We'll support what you do.

588
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,374
Wow.

589
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:19,159
District attorney.
Oh!
All right, Erin.

590
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:22,945
Look at you.I appreciate the support,

591
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:25,208
but I haven't made
a decision yet.

592
00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:26,253
Well, what the heck
are you waiting for?

593
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:27,863
It's a job
you were born to do.

594
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:29,996
Yeah.Be nice to have a friend
to cops in that office.

595
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,475
For once.

596
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,956
It's a complicated
decision for all of us.

597
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,610
What do you mean,
all of us?

598
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,568
Well...

599
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:39,701
a lot of hard
questions get asked,

600
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:41,964
and the answers get checked
and double-checked.

601
00:27:42,008 --> 00:27:44,619
Folks sticking their noses
where they don't belong.

602
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,970
And nothing's out of bounds,
and I mean nothing.

603
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:49,929
Yeah, but we've all dealt
with the press before.

604
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:52,018
It's not the press.
They're at least visible.

605
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:53,759
It's the opposition research,

606
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:55,195
stuff on any
and all of us

607
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:57,588
that can just surface
out of nowhere.

608
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:59,199
So, you're telling me
that the Russians

609
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:01,244
are gonna be making
stuff up about me online?

610
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:04,334
I doubt it, but before
I make a decision,

611
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:07,598
I would like to know
that you guys are all on board.

612
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:09,122
Yeah.
Yeah.

613
00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:10,253
Of course. Yeah.

614
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:11,254
On board.And if there's

615
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:13,169
anything I should know,

616
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:14,954
anything that could
raise a red flag,

617
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:16,651
now would be the time.

618
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,307
You mean like my dad
being a convicted felon?

619
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,439
Well, that's already
out in the open.

620
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:23,789
Could it hurt you?

621
00:28:23,832 --> 00:28:24,920
I doubt it.

622
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:27,401
And that's on him, not on you.

623
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:29,446
Yeah.I got accused
of roughing up a clown

624
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,058
who doused some cops with water,
which made all the news.

625
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:34,277
Well, that guy only got half
of what he had coming to him.

626
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:35,496
And again, it's known.

627
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:37,411
Yeah.

628
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:39,456
Cat got your tongue?

629
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,894
I'm thinking.

630
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:43,243
This may take a while.

631
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:44,853
Well, you all know

632
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:47,464
I may have stepped on the line
once or twice in my career.

633
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:49,858
And Dillinger robbed a bank
one or two times.

634
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:52,078
Hey, I'll stack Danny's record

635
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:53,601
against any detective
on the job.

636
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:54,776
Thank you, Dad.
Mm.

637
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,517
And I have a clear conscience
about it,

638
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,301
so I say you should go for it.

639
00:28:58,345 --> 00:29:01,522
Grandpa, anything I should know?

640
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:02,958
I'll take the Fifth.

641
00:29:03,002 --> 00:29:04,090
Hmm.Oh.

642
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:05,439
Does a fake I.D. count?

643
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:06,440
What?

644
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:08,442
I think you're okay.

645
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:10,357
Hopefully, yours is better
than your dad's.

646
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,141
What?
Yeah. What was

647
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:14,230
the name on that thing?"Marion Morrison."

648
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:16,450
Marion?

649
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:17,712
Seriously?

650
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,409
It's John Wayne's name
in real life.

651
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:20,671
Who?

652
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:22,978
That's sad.

653
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:24,806
And if those are the only

654
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,590
skeletons in the
closet, you know what?

655
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:29,506
I'd say you're good to go.

656
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,552
Yeah.

657
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:32,553
Good to go.

658
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:34,163
Do it.Thank you, everyone.

659
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:35,686
Pass the potatoes, Marion.

660
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:41,431
Well, Gramps,

661
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:44,565
I sure hope your boy Davis
is behaving himself.

662
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:46,393
I'll take his behavior
over yours.

663
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:49,439
Wait for me in the car.

664
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:55,489
Do you mind telling me
what happened to Henry Reagan?

665
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:57,578
'Cause this bleeding heart
I've been riding

666
00:29:57,621 --> 00:30:00,102
around with the last few days
I have no idea who he is.

667
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:02,496
Domestic violence cases
are loaded with landmines.

668
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:03,497
Uh-huh.

669
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,499
You got to walk softly.

670
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:06,848
Well, I know that, Gramps.

671
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,458
That's exactly my point.

672
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:10,243
You know, this isn't
my first rodeo.

673
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:12,680
Problem is, you're acting like
the bull and not the rider.

674
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:14,464
But if this guy Davis
goes off on his wife,

675
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:15,726
he could do serious damage.

676
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,511
He's never hurt
anyone in his life.

677
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:19,426
But if he goes
back to jail,

678
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:21,123
it'll do some real damage
to his son.

679
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:22,646
Well, I think he should have
thought about that

680
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,909
before he became a junkie.

681
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:25,388
Look, Gramps,

682
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:27,826
I became a cop in
the first place because of you

683
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,653
and the stories you told
about the old days

684
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:31,177
when cops didn't look
over their shoulders,

685
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,918
and they did
what they had to do.

686
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:34,745
Watching you work this case
makes me wish

687
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:37,487
I'd kept those stories
to myself.

688
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,623
Well, if that's how you feel,

689
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,625
I'll ride solo on the Davis case
from here on in.

690
00:30:44,668 --> 00:30:46,496
I'll do the same.Good.

691
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,465
Detective Reagan?

692
00:30:58,508 --> 00:31:00,554

This is all my fault.

693
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:02,643
What-what happened?
What's your fault?

694
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:04,863
I went to pick up Andrew
from soccer practice,

695
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:07,474
and his coach said that
Warren had already taken him.

696
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:08,823
Taken him where?I don't know.

697
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,216
And I've been calling
their cell phones,

698
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:11,870
and neither one of them
is picking up.

699
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,828
Well, didn't the teachers know
about the order of protection?

700
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,830
Well, with everything going on,
I didn't have a chance.

701
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,571
I can't believe
this is happening.

702
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:19,138
Wait a minute. Wait.
It's not your fault, okay?

703
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:20,922
What I need you to do
is take a breath.

704
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:22,924
All right? I'm gonna have this
officer take your complaint.

705
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:24,926
I promise you I'll find him.

706
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:27,929
Go ahead.Right this way.

707
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:32,803
You heard?

708
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:34,718
Yeah.You know,

709
00:31:34,762 --> 00:31:36,851
if he was locked up
like I wanted him to be,

710
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,200
this would never
have happened.

711
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:40,202
And he wouldn't keep
acting like a perp

712
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:42,117
if you didn't keep
treating him like one.

713
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:44,206
So you're
saying this is my fault?

714
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,601
What I'm saying is this guy
is not who you think he is.

715
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:48,863
I don't give a damn who he is.

716
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,256
I got to go find this guy

717
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:52,954
a-and the son that
he just kidnapped!

718
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:54,564
I know where they are.You...

719
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,828
Well, do you plan on telling me?

720
00:31:57,872 --> 00:31:59,656
Oh, I thought
we were going solo.

721
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,094

Oh, my God, Gramps.

722
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:03,704
You drive.

723
00:32:03,747 --> 00:32:05,749
Gladly.

724
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:11,755
Ever go as Beyoncé
for Halloween?

725
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:13,932
Blackface.

726
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:14,933
Uh, no.

727
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:16,412
Run around topless

728
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:18,197
at Burning Man?
Anything like that?

729
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,112
No, I like to wear clothes
in public.

730
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:21,678
It's kind of my thing.

731
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:23,985
Your ex-husband have any beefs
he's been waiting to air?

732
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:26,205
We've aired them all, so no.

733
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:27,902
Daughter Nicky, any skeletons?

734
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,904
Not that I know of.This is all about

735
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,514
what you do know of.

736
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:33,081
You can't prevent surprises.

737
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,909
You can only anticipate them.

738
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,085
Right.

739
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:39,653
A run for anything these days
is like a daily colonoscopy.

740
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:42,221
But the model I made
from researching you

741
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:43,657
is the best kind.

742
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,311
Between your personal conduct

743
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:47,052
and the record of service
in your family,

744
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:49,924
there are offsets for almost any
situation that could rear up.

745
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,752
That's good.

746
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:54,059
Depends on
what you're looking for.

747
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:55,669
What does that mean?

748
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:57,845
Means if you're looking
at the scrutiny

749
00:32:57,888 --> 00:33:00,413
as an excuse
not to pursue the office,

750
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:02,937
the scrutiny ain't much of one.

751
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,027
Who said I was looking
for an excuse?

752
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:11,119
Isn't that
what you're doing here?

753
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:17,517
You wanted
to see me, Sarge?

754
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,345
Yeah.

755
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:20,868
How you holding up?

756
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:23,044
You mean
the IAB dog and pony?

757
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:25,003
Yeah.Yeah. It's no problem.

758
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:26,526
How long you been
on the job now?

759
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:27,701
19 years.

760
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:28,876
That's a damn good run.

761
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,269
You should be proud.

762
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:32,271
Thank you, sir.

763
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:33,968
Some guys,

764
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,623
they don't know
when to hang it up.

765
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:39,539
You don't seem like
that kind of guy.

766
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,543
I guess.

767
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:52,856
The job takes its toll.

768
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,771
I've heard of seasoned cops
throwing procedure

769
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:57,600
out the window
to take down a perp.

770
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:59,211
Oh, yeah?

771
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:01,474
Yeah, and jamming up
their partners in the process.

772
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:04,564
Look, I... I don't know
what Janko told you,

773
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:06,044
but I didn't do anything wrong.

774
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,175
Janko didn't tell me anything.

775
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:08,829
She didn't need to.

776
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:10,831
A cadet could look at that
collar and know something

777
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:12,137
wasn't right.Yeah, but IAB's

778
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,964
still got to prove it, right?And if they do,

779
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:16,097
your partner catches the blame.

780
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:18,491
Sarge, chances are
Phelps killed two people.

781
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:19,492
Mm-hmm.

782
00:34:19,535 --> 00:34:21,015
Probably more before that.

783
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,234
Now he's off the street.

784
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:24,279
Which doesn't justify
what you did.

785
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,327
And IAB's gonna
take your shield for it.

786
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,155
But there's a way out.

787
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:31,765
What is that?

788
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,593
You put your papers in. Today.

789
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:35,116
No way. No way.

790
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,596
I'm not quitting.Suit yourself.

791
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,425
But if you go down for this,
they'll take your pension.

792
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:42,384
You walk on your own,
you can keep it.

793
00:34:42,428 --> 00:34:44,647
And your reputation.

794
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:52,829
All right, can I have some time
to think about this?

795
00:34:52,873 --> 00:34:54,831
You got the time it takes
to get to that door.

796
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,535
All right, I'll...

797
00:35:02,578 --> 00:35:05,625
put my papers in
by the end of the day.

798
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,559
Those the two
you're looking for?

799
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:28,474
Yeah, that's them.

800
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:33,174
How'd you know
he'd bring him here?

801
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:36,177
Warren told me that the best
memory he had of his old man

802
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:37,483
was coming to the Garden

803
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:39,485
and he was sorry that he
never brought Andrew.

804
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:44,751
Guess you were right about
all that touchy-feely stuff.

805
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:46,796
Go figure.

806
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,276
You want me to pull
'em from their seats?

807
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,323
You're the cop.

808
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:53,890
Nah.

809
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:55,979
Let 'em enjoy
the game.

810
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:58,895
I'll call the mom
and let her know the kid's okay.

811
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:00,723
But do you think you could
score us a couple of seats

812
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:02,072
so we can keep
an eye on 'em?

813
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:04,771
No problem.Thanks.

814
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:10,559
Sometimes there
is no bad guy.

815
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:13,954
I should've listened to you.

816
00:36:13,997 --> 00:36:16,696
I'm... sorry I didn't.

817
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:18,088
Talk's cheap.

818
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:23,485
Two dogs,

819
00:36:23,529 --> 00:36:26,053
fries and a
beer, right?

820
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:27,837
Don't forget the Red Vines.

821
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:30,231
Right.

822
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:39,458
Hey.

823
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:40,807
Hey yourself.

824
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:44,724
Troy put in his papers today.

825
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,595
Yeah. So I hear.

826
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:49,250
Lets me off the hook
in a big way.

827
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:50,860
Yeah, you caught a nice break.

828
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:53,080
How'd you do it?

829
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:55,256
What are you talking about?

830
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,956
I just laid out the facts.

831
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,480
Troy made his own decision.

832
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:04,004
And likely saved my career
in the process.

833
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:05,962
Thanks to you.

834
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:07,268
Yeah, well,
I put you in the fire,

835
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:09,183
so least I could do
was pull you back out.

836
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:13,143
Mm. It was a tough situation
all around.

837
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:15,450
99 times out of 100,

838
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:17,235
I go by the book.

839
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:20,020
I make that call to IAB.I know.

840
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:22,936
Well, but the trouble is you're
the one time that I shouldn't.

841
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,852
You did what you thought
was right.

842
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:26,940
Yeah, but that's
not good enough.

843
00:37:26,983 --> 00:37:29,116
Not when it comes to you.

844
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,291
I messed up.

845
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:32,989
I'm sorry.

846
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:35,253
In the end,

847
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:39,082
you had my back,
like you always do.

848
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:43,348
We knew working together
was not gonna be easy.

849
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:45,524
Yeah, but family comes first.

850
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:47,308
You come first.

851
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:49,832
I never doubted that.

852
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,232
Um, I-I have...

853
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:00,278
Hi.

854
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,062
I really was in
the neighborhood.

855
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,846
Had a meeting with the D.A.

856
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,544
How'd that go?

857
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:07,459

Oh, I don't think he likes me.

858
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:08,851
What makes you say that?

859
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:10,331
He did that thing they do

860
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,290
where they compare an
entrepreneur in elected office

861
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:16,119
to calling an auto mechanic
to do your hip replacement.

862
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:19,079
You know, I'm not
a professional politician.

863
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:19,906
He said that?

864
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:21,081
In so many words.

865
00:38:21,124 --> 00:38:22,474
So, not in those words

866
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:24,302
just close enough
that you could bend it that way?

867
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:29,307
Mm.

868
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,875
My wife Vanessa and our boys,
Gavin and Julian.

869
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:35,095
Beautiful family.

870
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:36,401
Second wife.

871
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:38,838
Married 15 years.

872
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:41,362
Made all my mistakes
first time around.

873
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:43,886
And you're telling me that why?

874
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,672
My interest in you

875
00:38:46,715 --> 00:38:50,328
is purely collegial
and will never be anything but.

876
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:52,982
It's important, in this climate,

877
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:54,288
to get that out in the open.

878
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,770
Plus, it's the truth.

879
00:38:57,813 --> 00:38:59,467
I believe you.

880
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:02,557
Good. You should.

881
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:06,213
I don't have a decision.

882
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:08,041
I don't have a deadline.

883
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:10,173
I'm gonna wait
until after you're sworn in.

884
00:39:10,217 --> 00:39:12,088
If I did have a deadline,

885
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:13,655
that would be past it.

886
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:16,266
Are either
of the other two prosecutors

887
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:20,096
that you've approached aware
that you're playing the field?

888
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,926
That hasn't come up in any
of my conversations,

889
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,450
including the one
I had with you.

890
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:26,668
How do you know?

891
00:39:26,712 --> 00:39:30,019
I know guys who know guys.

892
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:33,022
Course you do.

893
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:35,677
So let's be really clear.

894
00:39:35,721 --> 00:39:38,898
I like you for this,

895
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:40,552
and I'm guessing
you've rehearsed

896
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:43,816
a D.A.'s version of an
Oscar acceptance speech

897
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,688
in front of a mirror
more than once.

898
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,345
The people I believe in,

899
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,478
I don't pave the way.

900
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:57,177
I throw as many obstacles
as I can inthe way,

901
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,440
see if they got
what I think they do.

902
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:03,183
Understood.

903
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:05,968
See you.

904
00:40:06,012 --> 00:40:08,493
I hope.

905
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,630
Uh, I'd like to thank everyone
for coming out.

906
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:18,328
Always happy to celebrate
my birthday

907
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:21,070
with my fellow FDNY brothers

908
00:40:21,114 --> 00:40:23,159
and sisters.

909
00:40:23,203 --> 00:40:25,335
Let's hope the judge
goes easy on me.

910
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:28,426
Sláinte mhaith.

911
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:31,167
Sláinte mhaith.

912
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:33,300
Oh, boy,
look who just walked in. Oh, it's that guy.

913
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:37,347
What does he want?

914
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:44,659
Sorry to crash your party.

915
00:40:44,703 --> 00:40:47,445
Sorry to say I'm
getting used to it.

916
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:50,317
This is Officer Bruce Zarrelli.

917
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,015
Yeah. We've met.

918
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:54,887
Officer?

919
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:57,150
Commissioner Rourke,

920
00:40:57,193 --> 00:40:59,544
I overreacted the other night,

921
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:01,633
and I'm sorry.

922
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:03,504
Please accept my apologies.

923
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:07,029
The D.A.'s dropping
the harassment charges.

924
00:41:07,073 --> 00:41:08,814
You can ignore the summons.

925
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:10,511
You had a hand in that?

926
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:13,645
It was the right call.

927
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:18,780
I'm sorry you felt disrespected
by my people.

928
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:24,438
I should've kept my cool.

929
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:28,486
Happy birthday.

930
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,707
Should I get the Bomb Squad
to open this?

931
00:41:34,753 --> 00:41:37,407
Commissioner's courtesy card,
with his cell phone number.

932
00:41:37,451 --> 00:41:39,366
If you need him,
give him a call.

933
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:41,411
Anytime.

934
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:45,677
Thank you, Frank.

935
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:49,332
You're welcome.

936
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:50,638
Just don't share it

937
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:52,074
with all these guys.

938
00:41:52,118 --> 00:41:54,642
I don't want to get woken up
ten times a night.

939
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:06,524
Okay.

940
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:11,746

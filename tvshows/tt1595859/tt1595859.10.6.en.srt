1
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,362
Excuse me. Excuse me.

2
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:16,320
Excuse me.
I need to see Sergeant Reagan.

3
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:18,496
He expecting you?No. I'm Connor O'Brien.

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,195
I'm his Chevy mechanic.I'm sorry. His what?

5
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:23,066
Could you please just ask...?Hold on.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,373
Hey, Connor,
come on back.

7
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:29,029
I'm real sorry
to bother you.No. What's the matter?

8
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:32,249
What's going on?

9
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,512
This.

10
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,079
Okay.

11
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:37,515
And this.Mm.

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,517
And this.And this is?

13
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,084
My daughter Caitlin.

14
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:43,217
You're certain?

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,219
There's no face
on any of these.

16
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:48,004
That birthmark,
that tattoo.

17
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,571
Okay.

18
00:00:49,614 --> 00:00:51,660
She's been a mess.

19
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:53,140
She wouldn't tell me
what was up,

20
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:54,402
so I looked through
her browser history.

21
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:56,882
I thought maybe
she was being bullied,

22
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:58,493
but then I found this.

23
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:00,495
"Revenge porn" they call it.

24
00:01:00,538 --> 00:01:02,236
I-I looked it up.All right, take it
easy. Take it easy.

25
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:04,064
You need to get
these taken down.

26
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:05,891
That's not what I do,
but I'll refer you

27
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:07,328
to the right department.No, no, no.

28
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:09,417
We need to keep this
on the down-low. Please.Okay.

29
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,114
Okay, take it easy. Just...

30
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:12,420
Take it easy, all right?

31
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:15,031
Officer, can I get a glass
of water, please?

32
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:19,166
Hey, buddy.
How was school?

33
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,168
Fine.You hungry?

34
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:23,170
Always.

35
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:26,042
Hey, uh, weren't you supposed
to get your results back

36
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,696
from the NYPD exam today?

37
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:32,440
Hello?

38
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:34,268
Earth to Sam.

39
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:36,096
Hey! I-I was on the final boss.

40
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:37,619
I'myour final boss.

41
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:38,968
You get the results?

42
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:41,057
Yeah.And?

43
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:43,407
I didn't pass.

44
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:46,628
Really? Why?

45
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:48,151
Guess I didn't get
enough answers right.

46
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,848
Oh, so you're gonna be
a wise guy, too, now?

47
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:51,937
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

48
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:55,463
You could take it again.
I'll work with you.

49
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:56,812
I can't take that test again.

50
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:58,422
Oh, yes, you can.

51
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,163
You agreed to this.

52
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:01,251
You mean youagreed.

53
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,123
Hey, don't you put this
back on me.

54
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,168
You said you wanted to be a cop.

55
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:07,431
Now you can't just quit
'cause the going gets tough.

56
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:09,259
Yeah? And what if I do?

57
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:11,261
Those are my rules,

58
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:14,264
and as far as I can see,
this is still myhouse.

59
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:26,146
So,

60
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,148
former Officer Rick Austin.

61
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:30,324
Lost his thumb and index finger

62
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:33,979
on his shooting hand in 2015,
his first year on the job.

63
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:35,981
So, in the line of duty?

64
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:39,202
Yeah. He was attacked with
a machete on the Lexington line.

65
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:42,597
So heroOfficer Austin?

66
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,427
Yeah, he got, uh,
three-quarters disability,

67
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,124
so, about 30K a year.

68
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,214
In 2017, he started

69
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:53,173
posting motivational
videos on YouTube,

70
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:57,960
which led to speaking tours and
bookings at corporate retreats.

71
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:01,746
You know something?

72
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,400
I got all sorts of people

73
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:05,837
who handle this kind of stuff
for me.

74
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:10,102
I'm not really sure
what my role is in this.

75
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:13,889
His spiel is "Every
man for himself."

76
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:16,326
How you've got to
reject all the family

77
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,807
and teamwork aspect
of workplace culture.

78
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,026
Using his experience
with the NYPD

79
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,420
as the, like, uh...

80
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:24,682
What's that called?

81
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:28,425
A cautionary tale.
How the NYPD broke all

82
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:32,081
its promises of solidarity and
security and just spit him out.

83
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,692
Uh...

84
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:38,130
He wears the uniform
and uses our logos for his show.

85
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:42,091
Well, maybe I'm just
in a generous mood,

86
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:43,614
but I think we're big enough

87
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:46,313
to absorb this poor guy's beef.
Next?

88
00:03:48,532 --> 00:03:51,100
He made almost six
figures last year

89
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:53,537
while still drawing
a full pension.

90
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,500
So our hero's double-dipping?

91
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:02,590
Which is why this is
landing on your desk.

92
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:05,027
If the bean counters
pull his pension,

93
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,943
you are Commissioner
Ebenezer Scrooge.

94
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:10,511
And he's got a
great big megaphone.

95
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,123
So do I.

96
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,472
You don't want
to get into this.

97
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:17,561
Then why the hell
did you bring it to me?

98
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,171
The bean counters made us.

99
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:23,306
Are you scared
of bean counters, too?

100
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,090
They want to pull his pension
by lunchtime.

101
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:26,657
We thought
you should be in on it.

102
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:37,320
Anybody come around here

103
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:39,017
regularly?
A boyfriend maybe?

104
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:40,410
No.

105
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:42,499
Not in the five years
Jane Miller's lived here?

106
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:45,023
I know. I always
wondered, too. Nice girl.

107
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,242
Pretty, too.

108
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,765
What about family and friends?

109
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,245
She didn't list
a contact number.

110
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,421
And no one came
looking for her?No. A package came.

111
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:53,554
I knew she'd be up here,
but she didn't answer,

112
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:54,903
so...All right.

113
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:56,165
We got it from here.

114
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:00,561
It's quite the
setup, huh?

115
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:02,824
Yeah. Fancy place.

116
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,739
Take it easy.

117
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:06,088
We don't have a warrant.

118
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:07,437
And she doesn't
have a heartbeat.

119
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:10,222
Not to mention, she has no
family or friends, so...

120
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:13,269
Come on.

121
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,227
Take a quick peek.

122
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:21,625
There's got to be hundreds here.

123
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:23,497
From who?

124
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,238
Green Haven
Correctional Facility.

125
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:28,284
Inmates?

126
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,243
Seems like Jane does
have a lot of friends.

127
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:33,158
They're all in prison.

128
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:03,754
Hey.

129
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:05,800
Hey.New coffeemaker came.
I test-drove it.

130
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:07,889
I feel like I could run
a marathon right now.

131
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:10,021
You got a second?Yeah. What's up?

132
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:11,414
In here.

133
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,503
Uh, have a seat.

134
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,245
Don't freak out.

135
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:18,290
What?

136
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:22,686
What am I looking at?

137
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,645
A revenge porn site.
One of about ten

138
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:26,168
that I found these pictures on.

139
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,126
Slow day at the office?

140
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,258
Friend of mine's daughter.

141
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:33,044
Did you send it up
to Computer Crime?

142
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,394
No. He asked me to handle it.

143
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:37,571
Jamie, you are
in no position to...I know that.

144
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:39,703
Does he know who posted it?

145
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,836
She hasn't said much.

146
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,577
Think you can get her to talk?

147
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:47,363
What, 'cause I
went through this?

148
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,712
That make me some kind of guru?

149
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:50,148
'Cause she's way more likely

150
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:52,150
to open up to you
than me or her dad.

151
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:55,850
Does Dad realize that
these are selfies?I don't know.

152
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:58,069
I didn't bring it up to him.
He's kind of a wreck.

153
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:01,595
I don't know, Jamie.

154
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:05,337
Even if she did send 'em first,
she didn't send 'em here.

155
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:12,475
You got me into this.

156
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,650
You want me to take the lead?

157
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:15,347
Are we in your office?

158
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:18,176
Do you worry about the PR
implications before you speak?

159
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,439
When appropriate.

160
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,092
My interrogation skills
could be put

161
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:22,485
to good use here, boss.

162
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:23,573
All set.

163
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:27,403
Morning.

164
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,926
Commissioner.

165
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,450
Lieutenant Gormley,

166
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:31,625
DCPI Moore.

167
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:32,626
Sit down, please.

168
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:42,505
It seems
there is a misunderstanding

169
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,507
about how our pensions work.

170
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:47,945
I appreciate this opportunity
to clear it up.

171
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:49,773
Well, I read the paperwork,

172
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:52,080
but I'm-I'm missing two fingers
on my good hand,

173
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:55,344
and the pension doesn't even
begin to cover that, so...

174
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:59,348
Well, I see your logic,
but the fact remains...

175
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:00,828
It's pennies?

176
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,486
30 grand a year, untaxed,
is hardly pennies.

177
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:11,142
I got three kids
and-and limited prospects

178
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:13,275
on account of the disfigurement
that I suffered

179
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:16,060
as an NYPD officer
in the line of duty.

180
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:17,061
Disfigurement?

181
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:18,846
Yeah.

182
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:21,588
Got the right claw,
so I have to wear the glove.

183
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:24,068
And I get a lifetime
of Michael Jackson jokes.

184
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:26,201
I promise, we're on your side.

185
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:27,855
Oh, that'd be a first.

186
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,858
Listen, we could've just

187
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,250
turned you in to the IRS.

188
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:35,210
I put my life on the line
for this job.

189
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:36,820
Which is why
you are sitting here

190
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:39,562
and not in front of the IRS.

191
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:41,172
I need that money.

192
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,826
I-I deserve the money.

193
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,872
Well, you can say that
all you want,

194
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,787
but it won't change
the way it works.

195
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,223
Here's the deal.

196
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:49,833
You can continue
to make a great living

197
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:51,574
by criticizing this department.

198
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,358
We'll defend your right
to do that.

199
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:56,927
Even overlook the unlicenseduse
of our logos and signage.

200
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,973
I deserve that money.

201
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:05,762
So long as you declare your
income against your pension.

202
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:07,938
Commissioner,

203
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:10,071
I decided to join the NYPD

204
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:12,856
when I saw you speak
at my Iona graduation.

205
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,597
Do you want to know
what you said?

206
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:15,990
That the NYPD is a brotherhood.

207
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,557
That we take care of each other,

208
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,210
that we don't give up
on each other.

209
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:21,386
You're stealing
from our pension fund!

210
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,477
I wouldn't call that
brotherhood.

211
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:27,044
I accept a pension
that I was promised,

212
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:29,569
it's far less than I deserve.Well, that's how it works!

213
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,092
You want to take my money,
you're gonna have to serve me,

214
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,355
because I'm not going down
without a fight.

215
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:43,017
That went well.

216
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:49,110
Jane Miller did pro bono work
for some of the inmates here.

217
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:50,851
Or that's what she
claimed to be doing.

218
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:53,375
Take it you weren't much
of a fan?

219
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:55,377
She paraded around here
in her little skirt suits,

220
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,770
playing lawyer.

221
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,380
She wasn't fooling me.

222
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:00,034
What do you think she was doing?

223
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:01,122
Eating up the attention.

224
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:03,690
Anyone's attention
in particular?

225
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,257
She had a thing for Winston
Hill. Made that very clear.

226
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:08,390
How so?Jane believed

227
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,044
Winston was special, innocent.

228
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,873
He was like her cause.

229
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,440
Okay, well, we're gonna need
to speak to this Winston Hill.

230
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:17,181
Can't do that here.

231
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,530
You're denying us access?

232
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,576
Winston was released last week

233
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,274
on account of Jane Miller's
gaming the system, you ask me.

234
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:29,672
Thank you. I just...

235
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:31,500
I don't know
where to start.

236
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:34,851
Oh, how about
you introduce me to Caitlin?

237
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:37,898
Of course. Caitlin,
someone to see you!

238
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:40,074
Caitlin!Coming!

239
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:50,867
Hi, I'm Eddie.

240
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,826
You the cop?

241
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,175
I'm just here as a friend.

242
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:56,830
Who's here to help us
wake up from this nightmare.

243
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,312
Hey, could I get a glass
of water?

244
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:02,749
Sure.
Thanks.

245
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,969
About ten minutes from now?

246
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:08,058
Sure.

247
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:12,541
So...

248
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:16,719
I had a guy post naked pictures

249
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:19,330
of me on the Internet.

250
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:20,767
The hardest
part, for me,

251
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,595
was accepting
that it wasn't my fault.

252
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,817
This isn't your fault, either.

253
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:38,436
You probably sent those

254
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,482
to someone that
you trusted.

255
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:43,006
Maybe loved, even.

256
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,922
Yeah, well, live and learn.

257
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,794
Bad breakup?
Yeah.

258
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:52,189
I broke up with him
a few weeks ago,

259
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:55,366
so I guess some payback is,

260
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,542
you know, expected.

261
00:11:57,586 --> 00:12:00,023
Well, this is more
than just payback.

262
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,025
This is a crime.

263
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:04,071
I don't want to escalate it.

264
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:06,595
I don't care what
my dad wants.

265
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:08,162
You don't want those
pictures taken down?

266
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:10,120
Of course I do.

267
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:13,558
But not if it's gonna get Luis
all busted in the process.

268
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:16,561
Luis is the ex?
Yeah.

269
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:18,955
But you can't take this
any further.

270
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:22,350
I can't? Why not?

271
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:23,612
'Cause, I...

272
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,964

Cause it'll come out
that I sent the pics

273
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:29,531
to Luis in the first place,

274
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:31,141
and my dad'll have
a heart attack.

275
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,405
For real.

276
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:36,668
Look, I'm begging you,

277
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:39,584
just let it slide.

278
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:51,814
Hey. I just got
a very angry call

279
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:53,468
from our friends
at DCAS.

280
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:54,556
About?

281
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,601
About one of my
investigators

282
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:58,603
who went down there
flashing his shield,

283
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:01,911
looking for intel on
an official city exam.

284
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:04,131
Just wanted to see
Sam's test results.

285
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,959
I wanted to know why
he didn't pass

286
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:08,657
so I can see what he needs
to work on for next time.

287
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,877
It steps on a line,
Anthony, and you know it.

288
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,661
It's perfectly normal
to want to know

289
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:14,837
what's going on
so I can help him.

290
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:17,144
The normal thing to do
would have been

291
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:20,016
to ask Sam what Sam
needs to work on,

292
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,149
not a state office.

293
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,151
He wouldn't talk to me.

294
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:25,500
So you just gave up.

295
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:27,676
No, I-I went to find out
what I could.

296
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,721
Are you really
gonna lecture me

297
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:31,941
about trying to
help out family?No, but...

298
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:34,683
And foster family
is still family.

299
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:38,295
So don't say it's not.I wouldn't.

300
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,428
So, when is he gonna
take the test?

301
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:42,691
That's the other thing.

302
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:44,736
He said he's not.

303
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:52,048
Ah, what now?

304
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:54,181
Let me in there!

305
00:13:54,224 --> 00:13:56,357
Please, I just want to
talk to him, that's all.
Just let me in!

306
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,011
I just need to talk to him.What the hell's going on?

307
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:59,751
That guy was trying
to get inside the halfway house.

308
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,318
Caused a scene when
he was turned away.

309
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:03,538
Please! I'm serious!Hey.

310
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:04,669
Hey, hey, hey, hey!I'm not leaving

311
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,062
until I see that bastard!Hey!

312
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:08,021
You need to settle down, now!

313
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:09,892
Who the hell are you?

314
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:11,851
I'm Detective Reagan.
Who the hell are you?

315
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:13,200
Richard Lockhart.

316
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:14,766
I need to speak
with that man.

317
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,767
What man?

318
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:17,639
Winston Hill.Get in line.

319
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:20,424
N You still
looking into him?

320
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:21,773
No, we haven't even
started yet.

321
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:23,123
Why, what's it to you?

322
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,734
Winston Hill killed my daughter.

323
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:26,996
You're Jane Miller's father?

324
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,913
N-No,
I'm Leah Lockhart's father.

325
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:35,048
Winston Hill murdered
my daughter six years ago.

326
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:37,311
And now he's free,
living here!

327
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:45,014
Drop the flashlight.

328
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,842
You sure they're not
gonna let him in?

329
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,062
I said drop the flashlight, now!

330
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,414
Look, I feel for Mr. Lockhart.

331
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:55,720
All right, it's hard for me
to see him like that again,

332
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,157
like back in the trial.

333
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,506
But I don't want
no more trouble. Why?

334
00:14:58,549 --> 00:14:59,942
'Cause you murdered
his daughter?

335
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,552
No, I didn't.

336
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:03,467
The court saw that,
and they let me free.

337
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:04,686
On a technicality.

338
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:07,950
I was innocent
from the jump.

339
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,865
We're not here
about Mr. Lockhart.

340
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,780
We want to talk
about Jane Miller.

341
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:13,260
What about her?

342
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:14,652
What was your relationship?

343
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:17,177
She's my lawyer.

344
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,265
She volunteered
to take my appeal.

345
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:19,744
Hmm.

346
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:21,485
When was the last time
you saw her?

347
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,618
My last court day.

348
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,533
I guess.. You guess?

349
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:27,752
You don't remember
being in her apartment

350
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:28,971
last Monday night?

351
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:30,190
No, no, I wasn't.

352
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,278
Where were you?

353
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,583
I was right here.

354
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:34,150
With who?

355
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:35,673
Whoever else was here.
What's this about?

356
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:36,848
Something happen to Jane?

357
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:39,677
Jane Miller is dead.

358
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:41,810
What?

359
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:43,638
She was gunned down
in her apartment.

360
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:47,424
No.

361
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:49,600
No, no!

362
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,739
You're gonna have to try
a little bit harder

363
00:15:57,782 --> 00:15:59,523
than that, Mr. Hill.

364
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:05,007
You think I did it.

365
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:19,195
Hey, I'm home.

366
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:22,068
Sam?

367
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:24,896
Come on, pal.

368
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,637
Open the door.

369
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:28,248
I'm coming in.

370
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,747
Well, he was only
on the job for a year,

371
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,880
so yeah, he drew
the lowest pension rate

372
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:53,273
three-quarters
of a rookie's salary.

373
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:54,361
Hang on a sec.

374
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:56,058
What?

375
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:58,060
"Beloved author."

376
00:16:58,104 --> 00:16:59,235
There are a million
beloved authors.

377
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,411
What kind of clue is that?

378
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:02,586
Any letters?

379
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,414
Last letter, "N."

380
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,286
Toni Morrison.

381
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,070
She wrote a great book
called Beloved.

382
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,942
So, the guy is making
a nice pile

383
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:12,988
as some kind of
motivational speaker,

384
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,729
but he's still drawing
his full pension.

385
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:16,513
Drawing it
with two fingers missing.

386
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:19,647
Well, yeah, but I still
gotta turn him in.

387
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,866
And get called Scrooge?

388
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,347
That's what Garrett said.

389
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:26,219
Well, Garrett's right.

390
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:30,092
Look, a cop says he can
barely move his arms

391
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:31,572
because of his injuries,

392
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:34,401
gets photographed on
the first tee at Bethpage,

393
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:36,316
everyone gets that.

394
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,535
But this guy is not that guy.

395
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:42,800
The bean counters say
I have to claw his pension back.

396
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:45,325
They work for you.

397
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,459
I make this exception,
I'm an insurance adjuster

398
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:50,504
the rest of my time there.

399
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:52,027
They'll come out
of the woodwork.

400
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,377
You don't, you're Scrooge.

401
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:00,383
Gee... thanks, Pop.

402
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:01,732
Good talk.

403
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:03,038
I feel so much better now.

404
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,822
You're welcome.

405
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:15,398
And how about Sandra Jones?

406
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:16,878
Her story checks out.

407
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:18,445
So we're on the
right track here?

408
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:20,621
That's for you to decide.

409
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,277
How's it going with Sam?

410
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,541
It isn't. He ran away.

411
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,152
He just ran away?

412
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:33,503
He left a note,
thanking me for everything.

413
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:36,115
And did you try
to find him?

414
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,812
I made a couple calls,
and then I stopped.

415
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,248
Anthony.

416
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:40,771
He knows where to find me.

417
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:43,122
If he wants to come back home,
he's got a key.

418
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,036
So that's just it?

419
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,474
For right now it is.Just like that?

420
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:50,303
We're Trial Bureau,
not Family Court.

421
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:53,349
So shall we?

422
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,322
Luis Rosas.Yeah.

423
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:11,411
Sergeant Reagan, NYPD.
You got a minute?

424
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:12,847
Yes. For what?

425
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,936
I want to ask you some questions
about Caitlin O'Brien.

426
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,546
Is she okay?

427
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,505
She's not in the hospital
or anything.

428
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:20,420
Some compromising photos of her

429
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:21,551
made their way onto
the Internet.

430
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:22,726
You know anything about that?

431
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,511
No, I don't.

432
00:19:24,554 --> 00:19:26,991
But she did send you
some photos?

433
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:30,430
Yeah. We were hooking up,
and then we weren't.

434
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:32,693
She sent me some nudes.

435
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:35,130
Before or after
she broke up with you?

436
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,828
Broke up with me?
She tell you that?

437
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:40,004
Told my partner that, yeah.

438
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:42,920
No. I called it off.

439
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:44,661
She's a nice girl
and all, but...

440
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,315
a little too intense for me.

441
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,535
So maybe that's why
you posted the photos?

442
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:50,319
Get rid of her
once and for all?
No, no.

443
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:52,452
As soon as she sent me
those photos, I deleted them.

444
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:54,802
What was the hurry?Are you kidding me?

445
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:57,108
She's barely 16 and it's 2019.

446
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:59,502
So would you be willing to
submit your phone to us

447
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:00,721
for review?
Your computer, too?

448
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:02,592
You want to look
through my phone?

449
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,377
You say you got nothing to hide.

450
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,292
You know what?

451
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,511
I don't. Here.

452
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:10,383
You can follow me home, too,

453
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:11,601
take my computer.

454
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:12,950
I'll just do my homework
on the house one.

455
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,779
Look, Sergeant, really,
I got nothing to hide.

456
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:22,264
I'll let you know if we need it.

457
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,613
Thank you.

458
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:42,719
Sam.

459
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:53,252
You're killing him,
you know that?
Nah.

460
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,949
Yeah.He was fine before me,

461
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:57,343
which was, like,
99% of his life.

462
00:20:57,386 --> 00:21:00,520
You gave him purpose.
Everybody needs purpose.

463
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:01,521
I don't.

464
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:04,350
Everybody.
Especially you.

465
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:05,655
I'm good.

466
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:07,962
You're good? What's good?

467
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:10,399
Just breathing, walking around?
Is that where your bar is set?

468
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:13,097
I'm good setting my own bar.

469
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:14,882
I don't want to be no cop.

470
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,927
I don't think he cares
if you become a cop.

471
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:18,538
I think he just wants you
to follow through

472
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:19,495
with your commitments.

473
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,410
His commitments.Okay.

474
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:24,457
Just... just call him,
talk to him.

475
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,067
Maybe there's a middle ground.

476
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,460
Ms. Reagan,

477
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,853
I appreciate what you're doing.

478
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:32,856
And I really appreciate
everything Anthony tried to do,

479
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,206
but let's get real.

480
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,643
I think this is pretty real.

481
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:38,514
Real stupid.

482
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:40,560
You're running away from the one
person who wants to help you.

483
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:42,605
This was never real.

484
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,913
Me and him, father and son,
really?

485
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:47,523
A black street kid
and a white cop?

486
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:50,134
You paint us like a, like
a stray cat and a bulldog,

487
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:52,746
like this is some kind
of old Disney movie.

488
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,225
Those aren't real.

489
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,549
Officer Russell.

490
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:15,203
Lieutenant Gormley?Yeah.

491
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:17,248
You got a second?Yes, sir.

492
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:18,641
Here. Thanks.

493
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:24,734
2015, you were partnered
with an Officer Rick Austin?

494
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:27,389
Yes, sir. Until his injury
and subsequent retirement.

495
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:28,738
Right. Can you tell me
what happened

496
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:31,219
on the night of March 9th
of that year?

497
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:32,960
It's all been
well-documented, sir.

498
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:35,005
Yeah, but I'd like
to hear it from you.

499
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:36,703
The night of.

500
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:39,270
Again, I'm down verbatim
in the paperwork.

501
00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:42,665
I said... I'd like
to hear it from you.

502
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,017
It's been four years,
so could I review the paperwork?

503
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,410
Officer.

504
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:51,718
Am I under oath here?

505
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:54,155
You're answering
a higher-up's questions.

506
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:56,375
Way higher up.

507
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:01,467
Anything useful?

508
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,773
Nothing on Winston yet.

509
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:06,297
Why are you so sure
Winston's our guy?

510
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:07,995
Well, not for nothing,
but he's accused

511
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:09,692
of murdering
two different women.

512
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:11,085
I'd say the odds
are pretty good.

513
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:12,608
Yeah, the first one's
not our case.

514
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:13,740
That doesn't make it irrelevant.

515
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:16,264
Hold on.

516
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:18,048
Look at this.

517
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:22,618
Jane was a member of
a chat room, HelpAPrisoner.com.

518
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:25,360
What, like, a community service?

519
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,971
More like a dating service

520
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:30,191
disguised as a community
service. Look at this.

521
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:32,236
"Jane Miller, age 33,

522
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,152
looking to meet a man
who knows what he wants."

523
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:38,417
Why not eharmony
or one of those?

524
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,027
You know what they say
about dating an inmate.

525
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,681
Mm-hmm. They're always
where they said they were.

526
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:42,638
Yep.

527
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:44,640
Look at this.

528
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:47,948
Winston had a profile?Yeah.

529
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:49,297
And he messaged Jane

530
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,821
six months before
she even took his case.

531
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:53,475
They were involved?

532
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,303
Unless she refers

533
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:57,218
to all of her clients as "baby,"

534
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:58,611
I'd say they were
definitely involved.

535
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,439
Why wouldn't Winston
just mention that?

536
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,570
Go ahead, say it.Say what?

537
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:03,442
"Right again, Reagan."

538
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:12,929
So why didn't you mention
that the two of you

539
00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:13,974
were in a relationship?

540
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:15,845
We broke up.

541
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:17,891
Who broke up with who?That don't matter.

542
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:20,328
I'll decide what matters.

543
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:24,114
It was mutual.

544
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:25,768
It's never mutual,

545
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:28,510
and you still haven't
answered the question.

546
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:30,730
Why didn't you mention that you
two were in a relationship?!

547
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:33,515
I-I... I knew it would
make me a suspect.

548
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,648
Ah.All right, the-the cops didn't
believe me the last time,

549
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:37,345
and they tricked me
into that confession.

550
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:39,956
So you figured you'd lie
your way out of it this time?

551
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,480
I was scared.

552
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:42,785
Of course.

553
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:44,700
Though I'm not sure
what you'd be scared of.

554
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:46,441
I mean, dating is not illegal.

555
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,574
Oh, right.

556
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:51,577
You were scared
because murder's illegal.

557
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,013
I didn't kill her!

558
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,672
Sit tight.

559
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:03,545
Look it, he's gonna crack.

560
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:04,938
Okay? I know it.

561
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:07,636
I don't think so.What do you mean?

562
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:11,771
Hate mail.
I got these from Green Haven.

563
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:13,773
Apparently, the Lockharts
have sent threats

564
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:15,775
to Winston's cell
almost daily.

565
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:18,560
Well, of course they hate the
guy. He murdered their daughter.

566
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:20,040
They think he did.

567
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,608
Regardless, I'd hate him, too.

568
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:24,653
They didn't just send
letters to Winston.

569
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,437
What are you talking about?

570
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,831
Richard Lockhart sent this
to Jane Miller

571
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,616
after she won Winston's appeal.

572
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:35,142
"You've put my wife and I
through hell,

573
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:37,361
"which is exactly
where I intend to put you.

574
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:39,102
Sincerely,
Richard Lockhart."

575
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:40,582
It's explicit.

576
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,236
Yeah, okay, it's explicit.

577
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:44,064
And it could also

578
00:25:44,107 --> 00:25:46,675
just be a figure of speech.

579
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:58,121
Hey. I don't think Luis Rosas
posted those pictures.

580
00:25:58,165 --> 00:25:59,514
Me, either.

581
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,689
Based on?

582
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,648
Talking to Caitlin.

583
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:03,518
She told you that?

584
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,086
Not in so many words.

585
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,391
Then, in what words?

586
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:08,784
So, if someone posts

587
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:10,264
explicit photos of you

588
00:26:10,307 --> 00:26:12,962
and puts them on the Internet,
you want that person dead.

589
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:14,703
And her vibe
was more like

590
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:17,445
a mom going,
"He's such a nice boy."

591
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:19,621
Then why give us Luis's name
to begin with?

592
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,144
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

593
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:23,103
Maybe we should just send
this to Computer Crime

594
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:24,757
like you wanted
and end this thing.

595
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,193
No, no, no.
I think you were right.

596
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:27,890
I don't think we should risk
sending some kid to jail

597
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:29,675
until we know
what actually happened.

598
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:31,720
Okay.Did Luis

599
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:33,635
say anything about
his relationship with Caitlin?

600
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,289
Just that she was
too intense for him

601
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:36,769
and that's why
he broke up with her.

602
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:38,771
And she said she dumped him.

603
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:50,521
Sorry, I had to dot a couple
of I's. You ready for this?

604
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:52,785
Ready for what?Don't kill
the messenger.

605
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:54,656
I talked to Austin's
old partner.

606
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,616
By talk, I mean I made him talk.

607
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,662
"On the night of March 9, 2015,
Machete Guy, Manuel Escobar,

608
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:02,403
"was apprehended

609
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:05,406
"on the southbound subway
platform at 59th and Lex.

610
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:08,452
Two officers received
lacerations in the struggle."

611
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:10,454
One of them Rick Austin?

612
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:11,717
"At the same time,

613
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,457
"rookie Officer Rick Austin
and his partner

614
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,285
"were staking out
on the platform

615
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:16,678
"on 51st
and Lexington,

616
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:19,507
as part of the team
trying to nab Machete Guy."

617
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,161
Wait, if Austin wasn't
on scene, then how...

618
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:26,253
"Austin hid in the electrical
closet for his stakeout.

619
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:28,037
"He tripped in the dark,

620
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:30,474
"and the foiled-wrapped
sausage and peppers hero

621
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:33,042
"he bought for a snack
came in contact

622
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:38,526
with an exposed breaker socket,
vaporizing two of his fingers."

623
00:27:48,144 --> 00:27:50,712
My, oh, my.

624
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:57,719
And they took him
to the same hospital

625
00:27:57,763 --> 00:27:59,503
as the other wounded cops.

626
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:00,722
Bingo.
And somebody

627
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:02,593
got the bright idea
to save this officer

628
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:04,683
and this department
from the humiliation.

629
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,728
And by the time Mayor
stopped by Austin's room

630
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:09,296
to call him a hero
and take a picture with him,

631
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:11,472
this thing was written in stone.

632
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:25,442
You know, you're the PC's
daughter, so any cop

633
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:28,837
is gonna make like it's his
pleasure to drive you around

634
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,056
looking for a
runaway kid.

635
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,014
You realize
that, right?

636
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:33,363
And I still have friends

637
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:36,497
in a lot of the houses,
to answer your question.

638
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,326
I was trying to help a friend
with a family matter.

639
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:41,502
Yeah, well, it steps on a line.

640
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:44,548
I see your point.

641
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:47,464
And I appreciate the sentiment,
I really do.

642
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:49,466
But this is my family matter.

643
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,513
And single parents
need help sometimes.

644
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:54,384
Yeah, and if they do,
they can ask for it.

645
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:56,865
You know, you went through a lot
of tough stretches with Nicky.

646
00:28:56,909 --> 00:28:58,911
Did you ever see me,
uh, waylay her

647
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:02,175
on the street for
a talking-to?

648
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:05,482
You're absolutely right
and I apologize.

649
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,752
Anyway, how was he?

650
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:18,582
Ten toes, ten fingers,
if that's what you mean.

651
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,671
He's a tough kid.

652
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:24,632
Well, thanks for hearing me out.

653
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:27,940
Did he say that
he wouldn't take the test

654
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,333
or couldn't?

655
00:29:31,987 --> 00:29:33,989
I honestly don't know.

656
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:41,954
And of all the things I don't
get about the young people,

657
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:43,825
that's the one
I don't get the most.

658
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:45,261
I'm with you for once.

659
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:46,393
For once?

660
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:47,524
It's not like
she meant

661
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:49,613
for the pictures to go public.

662
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:51,006
Yeah, but the fact
is, she's the one

663
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,616
that put the pictures
out there in the first place.

664
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,922
Yeah.And if she hadn't,

665
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:54,967
there wouldn't be any pictures
of her out there.

666
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,969
Back in the day,
the girl next door

667
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:59,536
wanted to show everyone her
assets, they did it in Playboy.

668
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,625
Yeah, but she wasn't really
the girl next door

669
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:03,453
unless you were living
next to a modeling agency.

670
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:04,585
Beg to differ.

671
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:07,501
"Girls of the Big Ten,"
actual students.

672
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:10,417
Apparently,
Dad looked that one up.

673
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,549
I guess so.

674
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:16,684
Well, a guy falls
in love with a girl,

675
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:20,427
and he finds out that she has
nude photos of her out there

676
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,516
in the world for
everyone to see.

677
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,778
That guy took a
punch in the gut.

678
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,345
True.

679
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:27,869
Especially if it's, like,
his first big love or something.

680
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:30,872
That sucks for both of them.

681
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,918
Thing I don't understand
is why are people so willing

682
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:34,397
to give up their privacy?

683
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:35,442
Maybe she has
a different definition

684
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:36,965
of privacy than you do.

685
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:38,184
Well, what's more private
than naked pictures of yourself?

686
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:39,663
Yeah.

687
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:43,711
There's this girl at school,
she's sexted, like, 20 guys.

688
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:45,844
Nude selfies, too.

689
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:49,891
Her dad hits her.

690
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:51,937
You're saying she does it
because her dad hits her?

691
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,199
Well,

692
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:55,505
if anybody finds out
that her dad hits her,

693
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:58,900
that's what she would
be really mortified by.

694
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:03,122
The pictures are, like, her way
of getting back at her father.

695
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:05,994
Wow.

696
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:07,648
And you know this how?She talks to me.

697
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:09,302
Before you ask,

698
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:11,304
no, I haven't looked
at the pictures.

699
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:13,045
Maybe that's why
she talks to you.

700
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:15,699
Guy who wrote, uh,
Hundred Years of Solitude...

701
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:17,484
Gabriel García Márquez.

702
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:18,572
Thank you.

703
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:21,662
He said,
"Everyone has three lives

704
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:25,231
a public one, a private one,
and a secret one."

705
00:31:25,274 --> 00:31:26,754
Mm.

706
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:29,626
I always thought that should be
taught at the Academy.

707
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,498
Useful for cops
looking for motive.

708
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:32,716
Or for the victim

709
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,588
in your complaint.

710
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:37,591
Or for understanding
your friend.

711
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:39,898
Or maybe we should go back
to just locking the doors

712
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:42,726
and pulling down the blinds.

713
00:31:55,522 --> 00:31:56,479
Hey, Sam.

714
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:04,313
Hey.

715
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:07,229
Do me one favor.If I can.

716
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:09,362
I'm not here to try to make you
come back, I promise.

717
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:14,541
Open this to anywhere,
read me a paragraph.

718
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:17,239
Sports recap,
anything you like.

719
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:21,461
'Cause you won't or
'cause you can't?

720
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,420
I can read part of it,
it-it just takes me forever.

721
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:26,248
Look, we can get help for that.

722
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,597
But you got to want it.

723
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:30,992
I know I'm supposed
to, I just...

724
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:32,602
I got enough things
that I fail at.

725
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:35,649
Can I get back to my boys?

726
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:39,174
Sure. Can I get my keys back?

727
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,222
Okay?

728
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:48,096
Look, I want to be
a good father

729
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,969
good foster dad to you,
but forcing it on you

730
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:52,405
isn't gonna make me one.

731
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:55,495
All I know to say
is that,

732
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:57,366
if you need my help...

733
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,630
...you know where to find me.

734
00:33:02,371 --> 00:33:03,633
Thanks.

735
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:34,012
So, what happens now?

736
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,361
We're gonna ask
Computer Crime

737
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:38,407
to trace the IP, in which case,

738
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,496
it could get bumped up
to a felony.Thank you.

739
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,021
What-what exactly
does that mean?

740
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:44,326
Prison time,
most likely.

741
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,328
How much depends
on what the D.A. charges.

742
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:47,503
For who?

743
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:49,331
For Luis, for one.

744
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,986
We're not letting this go,
Caitlin. I told you...

745
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,640
Dad, please.

746
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:56,251
That isn't fair.Why isn't it fair?

747
00:33:56,295 --> 00:33:57,339
It just isn't.

748
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:01,735
If you know
something else,

749
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:03,563
we strongly suggest
you share it.

750
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:05,565
Yeah, as is, we can
still help you.

751
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:07,088
If this goes
any further...

752
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:08,481
He's got it
coming to him.

753
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:09,525
What he did to you...

754
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:12,050
What Idid to me.

755
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,138
What?

756
00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:16,750
I posted the pictures, Dad.

757
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:18,273
Okay?

758
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,887
Why did you do that?

759
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:26,586
Because he broke my heart.

760
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:27,674
I wanted to get him back.

761
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:29,371
By letting the world
see you naked?

762
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:31,721
By letting the world think
he was that kind of guy.

763
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:35,551
So you wanted to ruin his life? No, no.

764
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:37,945
I just wanted him
to feel alone, too.

765
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:42,167
I swear, I didn't mean
for it to get this big.

766
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,648
I thought he would get grounded
or suspended, not go to jail.

767
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:47,476
You lied to everyone!

768
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,522
And youwent to the police,
and here we are.

769
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,525
Do I need to get
a lawyer?

770
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:55,136
I think we can handle this
outside of court.

771
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,530
Really?

772
00:34:57,573 --> 00:34:59,619
Yeah, you just need to agree
to a couple things

773
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:00,576
counseling, for one.

774
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,144
Anything.And...

775
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:05,494
you need to set this straight
with Luis.

776
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:09,368
And everyone who thinks
he did this to you.

777
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:10,586
Got that?

778
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:26,385
Mr. O'Brien?

779
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:29,475
Your daughter hasn't been
this vulnerable

780
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:31,520
since the day she was born.

781
00:35:31,564 --> 00:35:32,826
Your instinct in

782
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:37,396
going to Sergeant Reagan
was to protect her.

783
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,659
She needs that protection
from you,

784
00:35:39,702 --> 00:35:42,662
now more than ever.

785
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,157
Richard should be back
any minute.

786
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,724
You really don't need
to wait on us like this.

787
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:03,639
It's the least
I could do.

788
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:06,729
I hope you're able
to get justice

789
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:08,296
for our Leah.

790
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,733
The detectives are getting
close to making an arrest.

791
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:13,910
You mean nailing
Winston Hill?
No.

792
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:17,566
It wasn't Winston who
killed your daughter.

793
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:21,744
Mrs. Lockhart, wh-where
is your husband?

794
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:29,056
Mrs. Lockhart.

795
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:30,536
Your husband,
where is he?

796
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:33,626
He said he was gonna finish
what you all couldn't.

797
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:35,323
Winston?

798
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,716
Yes.

799
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:38,761
Let's go.

800
00:36:57,476 --> 00:36:58,694
Richard!

801
00:36:58,738 --> 00:36:59,869
Hey!

802
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,439
You don't want
to do this.

803
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:09,879
You don't know anything
about what I want.

804
00:37:14,797 --> 00:37:16,408
Yes, I do.

805
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:20,368
I know you already
made one big mistake

806
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:22,414
when you killed Jane Miller.

807
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:29,421
Now they may see it as an
extreme emotional disturbance.

808
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:31,423
But you do it again,
that's your life.

809
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:38,125
He can't just run free!

810
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:39,909
Winston didn't do it.

811
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:45,393
What?

812
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:47,134
He didn't.

813
00:37:48,178 --> 00:37:49,919
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

814
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:51,312
Come on.

815
00:37:57,405 --> 00:37:59,712
Hands against the car.
Come on.

816
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:03,063
Gun.

817
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,898
Go ahead.It's your turn now.

818
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:13,465
My turn for what?

819
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:15,031
Say it.

820
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:17,947
You were right.

821
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:20,515
It doesn't feel so good
this time.

822
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,474
No, it doesn't.

823
00:38:45,453 --> 00:38:48,413
I go on eight minutes
past the hour, thank you.

824
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:57,596
It's not really
a good time, sir.

825
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:00,512
No time like the present,
Officer Sparky.

826
00:39:03,297 --> 00:39:05,299
Ring a bell?

827
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:12,611
They really call you that?

828
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:14,395
Oh, yeah,
the douchebags did.

829
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:20,270
So, here's the deal, Sparky.

830
00:39:20,314 --> 00:39:23,926
If I expose you,

831
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,580
a whole bunch of smart people

832
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:28,278
in my department,
not to mention some in city hall

833
00:39:28,322 --> 00:39:30,803
and one of our best hospitals,

834
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:33,414
they all look like clowns.

835
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:34,633
So there's that.

836
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:38,506
Plus, you were actually injured

837
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,681
in the line of duty,

838
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:43,859
although by
a sausage and pepper hero,

839
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:46,166
so there's that.

840
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:49,778
Yes.

841
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:54,174
You keep the secret,
you keep your pension.

842
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:59,527
As long as you deduct
your earnings against it.

843
00:40:00,572 --> 00:40:02,878
Okay.

844
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:06,665
If you spill the beans...

845
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,057
all bets are off.

846
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:10,582
And we pursue fraud charges.

847
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:16,718
And... as of right now,

848
00:40:16,762 --> 00:40:21,462
you stop talking down the NYPD
in your act.

849
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:23,377
Wait whoa, hold on,
I'm about to go on.

850
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,639
I-I... I can't change
the whole thing

851
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:26,249
in the next two minutes.

852
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:30,123
Hey, you improvised your way
out of an assault by a sandwich.

853
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,386
I have faith in you.

854
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,741
The biggest scam you're running

855
00:40:39,785 --> 00:40:44,485
is that the NYPD
doesn't take care of its own.

856
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:48,620
You have been the beneficiary
of more solidarity,

857
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:52,232
more protection, more loyalty,

858
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:54,887
from our brotherhood of blue

859
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,195
than any officer
I have ever known.

860
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:07,160
You realize that?

861
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,598
You, uh...

862
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:12,470
put it like that, yeah.

863
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:21,566
So thank you for your service.

864
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:31,663
And cut the crap.

865

1
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:18,908
Fear not, Kal-El.

2
00:00:18,908 --> 00:00:20,461
Who are you?

3
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:23,161
I am Jor-El...

4
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:24,847
your father.

5
00:00:24,847 --> 00:00:26,456
I thought you died!

6
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:30,753
I am his memory, his will.

7
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:36,479
I am to fulfill his promise and
guide you all the days of your life.

8
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,584
You are the last son of Krypton.

9
00:00:39,584 --> 00:00:41,875
When you traveled through the cosmos,

10
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,924
you carried the hopes and
dreams of your people.

11
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:48,174
They now live through you, Kal-El.

12
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:49,862
It is time.

13
00:00:49,862 --> 00:00:50,959
Time for what?

14
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:54,585
Time to accept your destiny.

15
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:58,065
I don't know what you have
in mind for me, but I--

16
00:00:58,065 --> 00:01:01,332
By the setting of the sun Sol,

17
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:03,474
you will return to me.

18
00:01:03,474 --> 00:01:09,010
Your destiny will be fulfilled.

19
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,914
Your thoughts are not
a mystery to me, Kal-El.

20
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:16,815
These people have served their purpose.

21
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:21,597
It is time to leave them.

22
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:28,614
Please!

23
00:01:28,614 --> 00:01:32,532
Everything and everyone
I love is here! In Smallville!

24
00:01:32,532 --> 00:01:35,376
You must let go of your past.

25
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:38,314
I will guide you to your future.

26
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:41,954
No, I don't want your guidance!

27
00:01:41,954 --> 00:01:44,411
I want to create my own future!

28
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:49,249
You have no choice, Kal-El.

29
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,516
Well, you're up early.

30
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:02,561
I never went to sleep.

31
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,237
Clark?

32
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:06,948
What's wrong?

33
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:13,712
I kind of met my biological father last night.

34
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,783
When I heard his voice,
it was coming from the ship.

35
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:27,886
But it sounded like
it was from my own head.

36
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:29,564
He said it was time.

37
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:31,080
Said it was time for what?

38
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,977
To leave Smallville and fulfill my destiny.

39
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:36,910
He said that?

40
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,620
I have until sundown today.

41
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:45,161
He said I didn't have a choice.

42
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:48,435
Why is it happening now when
my life is just coming together?

43
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:52,064
The farm's out of debt,
I'm gonna be a big brother...

44
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:54,547
Lana and I are finally getting together.

45
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:59,288
Whatever your biological father
may have had in mind for you,

46
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:03,990
they're his hopes and dreams,
not yours.

47
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,368
Clark, you choose your own destiny.

48
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:13,555
Nobody can decide that for you, son.

49
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:23,585
This is my home.

50
00:04:23,585 --> 00:04:26,528
And you're my parents.

51
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:32,741
It's where I belong, and
I'm not going anywhere.

52
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,980
I haven't seen you two
together since, um,

53
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,127
well Dad, since you tried to
bribe Helen into dumping me.

54
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:15,847
And now Dr. Bryce refuses to accept this,
my wedding gift to her.

55
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:22,678
If you two, uh, star-crossed
lovers will excuse me.

56
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,427
You, uh, you want to tell me
what that was all about?

57
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:29,473
Exactly what your father said.

58
00:05:29,473 --> 00:05:35,943
You know what? I'm tired of being
a pawn in this never-ending struggle.

59
00:05:35,943 --> 00:05:39,683
We both said some things last night.

60
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:44,062
I don't want to go into this marriage
with any secrets between us.

61
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:48,808
I haven't held anything back.

62
00:06:00,897 --> 00:06:02,701
I have.

63
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:05,277
Look inside.

64
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:15,217
I did break into your office,

65
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:19,529
and that's what I was after.

66
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:22,764
I told you because
I'm trying to break the cycle.

67
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:25,729
I don't want to be the person
who did this anymore.

68
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:30,065
But you did do it, Lex.
You committed a crime.

69
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:33,074
You violated my privacy
and that of my patients.

70
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:34,073
I know.

71
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:35,555
What did you think would happen?

72
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:37,969
That you'd give it back,
tell me what you did, and

73
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:42,136
I'd just forgive you and
we would live happily ever after?

74
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:45,025
I don't know what I expected.

75
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:48,068
All I know is that I love you.

76
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:53,682
I'm sure in some part of
that twisted mind you do.

77
00:06:53,682 --> 00:06:57,984
I didn't have it analyzed.

78
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:07,061
What was so important
about this blood, anyway?

79
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:11,296
I thought it would give me
the answers I've been looking for.

80
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:18,382
All it did was end this relationship.

81
00:07:33,392 --> 00:07:35,759
Are you okay?

82
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:41,825
Yeah, I'm great.

83
00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:50,710
You know, I can always tell when
you're being less than truthful.

84
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,121
It's just that...

85
00:07:55,121 --> 00:08:01,321
I've waited for this
for so long, for us.

86
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:04,706
I just don't want it to go away.

87
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:07,657
I'm not going anywhere.

88
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:13,713
Neither am I.

89
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:34,116
So, uh, does this mean you're
officially my date to Lex's wedding?

90
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:41,524
Only after we officially tell Chloe
about our change in status.

91
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:47,538
Clark, I've been avoiding her all day.

92
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:53,266
All right, just let me tell her.

93
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:59,070
Chloe and I agreed that we'd be
upfront about things like this.

94
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:06,498
Well, I'm sure if we're
honest, she'll be fine.

95
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:22,298
I never realized the small town
press could be so pithy.

96
00:09:22,298 --> 00:09:24,550
What do you think your father's up to?

97
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,723
Apparently he's already got a team working overtime
installing some pretty sophisticated machinery down there.

98
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:31,843
What for?

99
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:36,840
I wish I could tell you, but I'm the last person
he'd ever let back into those caves.

100
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,427
He's tightened security.
I doubt even you'll be able to get past.

101
00:09:43,638 --> 00:09:48,123
Uh, where's this tailor?
I'm kind of pressed for time today.

102
00:09:48,123 --> 00:09:50,492
I canceled him.

103
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:52,378
Why?

104
00:09:52,378 --> 00:09:56,366
Because Helen's not walking
down the aisle tomorrow.

105
00:09:57,167 --> 00:10:00,761
I saw her last night.
She seemed really happy.

106
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:02,286
Yeah, well,

107
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:04,738
a lot can change in 24 hours.

108
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,978
Why'd she break it off?

109
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:12,339
I've always been fighting my destiny,

110
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:14,923
trying to avoid becoming my father.

111
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:21,481
But we all have certain genes that, no matter
how much we want to change, dominate us.

112
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:24,558
What'd you do?

113
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:27,509
I betrayed Helen's trust.

114
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:34,314
Then I fought my own nature and
did something very unLuthor-like.

115
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:40,351
I confessed my sin,
hoping she'd forgive me.

116
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:44,991
My guess is she didn't.

117
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:47,710
Don't tell anyone, Clark.

118
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:54,220
I want to hold onto my romantic
notions for one more day.

119
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:24,502
I'm gonna have to put a stop
to these unauthorized visits.

120
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:26,697
Mr. Luthor.

121
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:29,232
What are you doing here?

122
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:31,557
I was just curious.

123
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,585
I suppose so.

124
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:41,180
According to poor Dr. Walden, you're
talked about quite a bit on these walls.

125
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,220
Apparently you are going to rule us all.

126
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,432
I'm surprised someone like you, Mr. Luthor,
would put stock in anything he had to say.

127
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:52,602
I know you worked closely
with the man, Clark.

128
00:11:52,602 --> 00:11:59,517
I'm sure there are insights you could give me.
It would be extremely helpful.

129
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:04,125
- He didn't tell me anything.
- Hmm.

130
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,613
What's with all the machinery?

131
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:18,236
I'm going to unlock the secrets
hidden in these walls.

132
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:22,193
Didn't you see what happened
to Dr. Walden? It's dangerous.

133
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:26,329
Yes, but I have something
he didn't. The key.

134
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:32,005
Once I insert that key into the slot,

135
00:12:32,005 --> 00:12:37,479
I'm convinced the answers
will be revealed to me.

136
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:40,152
I don't understand. I thought the
key was stolen from your vault.

137
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:46,185
It was, but before it mysteriously
disappeared, I had it analyzed.

138
00:12:46,185 --> 00:12:50,524
The composition was unique.

139
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:56,137
There's nothing like it on Earth,
with one exception.

140
00:12:57,306 --> 00:13:02,540
The meteor rocks
found here in Smallville.

141
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:09,234
So I have fashioned my own key.

142
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:16,336
It's identical in every detail.

143
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:21,839
Isn't it beautiful?
Look.

144
00:13:22,074 --> 00:13:23,718
Clark?

145
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:27,736
You don't look well.
Are you all right?

146
00:13:27,736 --> 00:13:29,750
I'm fine.

147
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,625
Just...

148
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,852
be careful.

149
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:39,723
Lionel Luthor's never gotten
anywhere in life playing it safe.

150
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:53,743
I'm sure you'll render Clark speechless.

151
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:54,892
Chloe, hi.

152
00:13:54,892 --> 00:13:58,566
Be careful you two don't upstage
the bride and groom.

153
00:13:58,566 --> 00:13:59,731
What do you mean?

154
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:02,525
You two are going together,
I assume.

155
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:05,828
Yeah, yeah.
As friends.

156
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:10,004
Right. Friends.

157
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,697
Have you seen Clark?
He's been looking for you.

158
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:16,057
No. Uh, I've been trying to
track him down all day,

159
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:21,337
but his parents said that he
was mired in best man duties.

160
00:14:21,337 --> 00:14:25,037
Uh, when did you see him last?

161
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:28,404
Oh, um, I ran into him
at the Talon. He, uh,

162
00:14:28,404 --> 00:14:30,619
wanted to talk to you,
said it was important.

163
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,055
Well, I guess it couldn't be
as important as you thought.

164
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:37,027
Have fun tomorrow.

165
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,944
I figured this is where I'd find you.

166
00:14:57,353 --> 00:15:00,254
Just watching the sunset.

167
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:03,515
I hope it's not the last one
I see from up here.

168
00:15:03,515 --> 00:15:06,362
It won't be, Clark.

169
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:10,811
Son, it's just another sundown.

170
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:34,360
Come on. Your mother's
got dinner ready.

171
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,443
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

172
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,543
Dad?

173
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,794
Yeah.

174
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:51,032
Thanks for always believing in me.

175
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:56,142
You're welcome, son.

176
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:07,234
It is time, Kal-El.

177
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:10,472
Come to me.

178
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:25,110
You will obey me, Kal-El.

179
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,920
You're not my father.

180
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,918
I won't let you control me.

181
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,496
This is the mark of your ancestors.

182
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:50,758
You cannot fight it, Kal-El.

183
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:57,095
At the zenith of the star Sol,
you will begin your journey.

184
00:17:01,427 --> 00:17:03,473
If you do not,

185
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:08,030
you will hurt the ones
you love most.

186
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:28,537
Clark! Why aren't you ready?

187
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:31,081
The wedding doesn't start for a few hours.

188
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:32,593
Your mother wants to get a good seat, son.

189
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,104
I promised Helen I'd go
early and check the flowers.

190
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:38,647
Well, I gotta pick up Lana,
so I'll meet you there.

191
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:44,145
We obviously have to get used
to the fact that you have a girlfriend now.

192
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:49,686
Clark.

193
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,374
How's it going today, son?

194
00:17:52,374 --> 00:17:53,817
Good.

195
00:17:53,817 --> 00:17:56,254
No voice?

196
00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:57,066
No voice.

197
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:59,834
Looks like you're just gonna have to
face the future the old-fashioned way.

198
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:02,470
I guess so. It's pretty scary.

199
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,265
Yeah.

200
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:06,754
Mom?

201
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:08,836
Yes.

202
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:12,184
You look beautiful today.

203
00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:15,948
Thank you, sweetheart.

204
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:38,303
Helen.

205
00:18:39,707 --> 00:18:40,683
You're here.

206
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:43,512
I am so angry at you.

207
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:46,296
What you did was unforgivable.

208
00:18:46,296 --> 00:18:47,228
You're right.

209
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:51,773
But the farther I got
from you and this town...

210
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:57,049
I realized that while any sane
person would've kept driving,

211
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:59,670
I needed to turn around.

212
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:06,405
I started to look at myself and the
mistakes that I've made in my life.

213
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:08,942
I hope I'm not one of them.

214
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:13,943
No, Lex, you're not.

215
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:17,043
That's the thing.

216
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:22,630
I still love you.

217
00:19:25,836 --> 00:19:28,393
Oh, man.

218
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:30,749
Does it hurt?

219
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:33,238
No. Not now.

220
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:36,503
You got any idea what it means?

221
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:41,096
It's my biological father's way of telling me I have to do what he wants.

222
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:45,295
I'm afraid by noon, it'll control me.

223
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:49,360
Your parents must be freaked out.

224
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:53,849
I didn't tell them.

225
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:55,575
Why wouldn't you tell them, Clark?

226
00:19:55,575 --> 00:19:58,556
Because, Pete,
I know what I have to do.

227
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:02,829
They'll never agree with me
in a million years.

228
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:05,194
I have to destroy the ship.

229
00:20:05,194 --> 00:20:06,654
What?

230
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:08,659
Clark, no.

231
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:10,857
This thing traveled millions
of miles through space.

232
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:13,123
I don't think we can dent it,
much less destroy it.

233
00:20:13,123 --> 00:20:15,382
What if we had a Kryptonite key?

234
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,386
Clark, this is whacked!

235
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:19,109
Pete...

236
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:20,686
do you remember Lana's necklace?

237
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,535
Yeah, but what's that have to
do with destroying the ship?

238
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:26,236
Everything, Pete. When Tina Grier tied
me up down here, it nearly killed me.

239
00:20:26,236 --> 00:20:30,000
But before it could,
the ship neutralized it.

240
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,862
You said the ship was protecting you

241
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:34,961
What if it's actually protecting itself?

242
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:36,783
Think about it, Pete.

243
00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:41,779
I'm from Krypton and so is this ship and
what's the one thing that can kill me?

244
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:46,487
So you're thinking that Kryptonite
can destroy the ship.

245
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:50,846
Clark, it's too dangerous.

246
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:54,910
Do you hear me? You've never done
this before. You don't know what'll happen.

247
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:59,576
It could kill you.

248
00:21:01,364 --> 00:21:07,208
Besides, where are we gonna
get a Kryptonite key?

249
00:21:15,516 --> 00:21:16,794
How much longer now?

250
00:21:16,794 --> 00:21:19,285
- Another ten minutes.
- Another ten minutes.

251
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:21,492
Hey, Luthor!

252
00:21:21,492 --> 00:21:23,153
I got something to say to you!

253
00:21:23,153 --> 00:21:26,768
Security, get him out of here.

254
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:28,540
Get off me!

255
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,438
If these guys don't let me go I'm gonna lay a lawsuit
on you so fast it's gonna make your head spin.

256
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:34,462
All right, all right, I'll talk him.

257
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:35,618
Do I know you?

258
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:36,921
Name's Pete Ross.

259
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,736
Ross, Ross, Ross.

260
00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:42,011
As in Ross Creamed Corn.
You stole my family's business.

261
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:45,291
Yes. I overpaid for that
ramshackle old factory.

262
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,321
Nobody in this town likes you!

263
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:48,680
Don't touch me.
You know you hate him.

264
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,900
I know that, but I value their hatred.
I find it very useful.

265
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:59,917
You see, people are always
at their weakest when they're angry.

266
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:03,332
Ask you father.

267
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,528
I'll do that.

268
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:12,880
Get him out.

269
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,729
No...

270
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:23,033
no...

271
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:26,624
NOOO!!!

272
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:28,348
You--

273
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,667
Search him. Search him.

274
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,465
Search me?
What are you doing?

275
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:35,689
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

276
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,532
Careful, Mr. Luthor.

277
00:22:38,737 --> 00:22:43,233
You wouldn't want to look weak.

278
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:50,625
Lex.

279
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:54,169
Mr. and Mrs. Kent.

280
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:55,938
Where's the, uh, best man?

281
00:22:55,938 --> 00:23:01,543
Well, you know Clark and punctuality have
never been on the best terms, but he'll be here.

282
00:23:01,543 --> 00:23:03,988
I got you something.

283
00:23:10,443 --> 00:23:11,721
A compass.

284
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:13,501
Yeah, it's a Kent family tradition.

285
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:15,742
My father gave me one on our wedding day,

286
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:19,708
just in case I got lost going down the aisle.

287
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,690
Thank you, Mr. Kent.

288
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:32,741
Why aren't you dressed?

289
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:35,948
Wow.

290
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:01,519
Um,

291
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,502
there's something I have to do first.

292
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:06,606
What?

293
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:10,322
I can't tell you.

294
00:24:10,322 --> 00:24:14,791
Just know it's for us
and our future.

295
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:22,558
Last time a guy said that to me,
um, he went off to war.

296
00:24:27,777 --> 00:24:30,280
You should go.

297
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,826
I'll meet you there.

298
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:46,598
Are you sure you're all right?

299
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:48,579
Yeah.

300
00:24:50,332 --> 00:24:52,654
Go.

301
00:24:52,654 --> 00:24:55,337
Okay.

302
00:25:00,335 --> 00:25:01,669
Lana, I--

303
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:04,116
Yeah?

304
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:08,053
I just wanted to remember this moment.

305
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:47,373
Any word on Clark?

306
00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:49,469
Helen's already circled
the church five times.

307
00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:52,240
He was coming with Lana.

308
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,206
Lana, where's Clark?

309
00:25:58,206 --> 00:25:59,873
He said he had something to do.

310
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:03,437
It seemed important.

311
00:26:04,824 --> 00:26:06,296
- Mr. Kent.
- I'm sorry, Lex.

312
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:08,582
It looks like you're gonna have to start
your wedding without your best man.

313
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:09,486
We can wait.

314
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:11,712
Hey, don't worry about Clark.

315
00:26:11,712 --> 00:26:17,534
You have far more important
things to do here. Good luck.

316
00:26:29,732 --> 00:26:35,672
Hey, Clark, I'm glad I caught
you before the wedding.

317
00:26:35,672 --> 00:26:36,979
Chloe, what are you doing here?

318
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:39,455
Is everything okay? I mean,
I heard you were looking for me.

319
00:26:39,455 --> 00:26:43,047
Yeah, um, I was, but...

320
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:44,779
I can't talk to you right now.

321
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:46,738
- What are you doing?
- Look, I promise I'll find you later.

322
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:50,681
- Clark, I--
- Don't worry. I'll find you, okay?

323
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:53,382
So how'd you decide?

324
00:26:53,382 --> 00:26:57,266
Rock-paper-scissors, coin toss, or did
you just happen to draw the short straw?

325
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:58,532
Decide?

326
00:26:58,532 --> 00:27:03,423
Who was gonna tell me that
you and Lana are together.

327
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:04,942
You know?

328
00:27:04,942 --> 00:27:09,162
Yeah. I came over to the barn the other
night to warn you about something.

329
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:11,008
About what?

330
00:27:11,008 --> 00:27:12,431
You know, it doesn't matter now.

331
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:16,063
The point is I saw you and
Lana in a major lip lock.

332
00:27:16,063 --> 00:27:19,377
- I-I didn't mean--
- Didn't what, Clark?

333
00:27:19,377 --> 00:27:24,117
Newsflash. You've always
been in love with Lana.

334
00:27:24,117 --> 00:27:28,011
I tried to deny it, thinking that maybe
we could work something out, but

335
00:27:28,011 --> 00:27:29,847
it's like fate, Clark.

336
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:32,379
Inevitable, but always surprising
when it actually happens.

337
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:34,363
- I was gonna tell you.
- Really?

338
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:38,388
Because obviously it was
on the top of your to-do list.

339
00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:41,578
You know, I can deal with the fact
that you guys are together.

340
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,523
It hurts, but I was prepared for it.

341
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:46,970
But we just made a promise
to be honest with each other,

342
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,907
and you didn't have the
guts to keep you word!

343
00:27:49,907 --> 00:27:50,311
Chloe--

344
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:55,260
Or was it just that it was too much fun making a
fool of me that you couldn't reveal your secret?

345
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,685
Have a nice life, Clark.

346
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:31,096
Mr. and Mrs. Luthor, welcome aboard.

347
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:32,711
It'll be a couple of minutes
before we can take off.

348
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:34,725
The tower's generator just kicked in.

349
00:30:34,725 --> 00:30:37,047
Seems the whole county suffered
some sort of power failure.

350
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:41,444
Good. It'll mask our get away.

351
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:48,644
To our new life.

352
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,821
What's the matter?

353
00:31:53,821 --> 00:31:55,677
Nothing.

354
00:31:55,677 --> 00:31:58,971
Everything's perfect.

355
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:17,816
How is she?

356
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:20,817
Doctors don't know yet.

357
00:32:23,132 --> 00:32:26,430
What did you do, Clark?

358
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:32,006
I stole Lionel's Kryptonite key.

359
00:32:32,006 --> 00:32:35,530
I put it in the ship.

360
00:32:37,819 --> 00:32:41,957
And why did you do that?

361
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:46,290
Dad, I lied about the voice.

362
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:53,678
It did come back. It told me
I had to leave by noon.

363
00:32:53,678 --> 00:32:56,538
I didn't have a choice, Dad.

364
00:32:56,538 --> 00:32:58,591
I had to destroy the ship.

365
00:32:58,591 --> 00:33:02,871
Why didn't you tell us?

366
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:07,810
I knew you wouldn't
agree with what I did.

367
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:15,079
Dad, I didn't want it to
take me away from you.

368
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:17,258
I'm so sorry for what I did.

369
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:20,267
Your actions have consequences, Clark.

370
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:22,029
Didn't your mother and I
ever teach you that?

371
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:25,678
- Yes, but--
- There's no time for excuses, Clark.

372
00:33:25,678 --> 00:33:27,650
It's too late.

373
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,388
You didn't think this thing through.

374
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:33,928
You had no idea what was
gonna happen, and now...

375
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:39,434
Now your mother is lying
in a hospital bed.

376
00:33:40,256 --> 00:33:43,627
Mr. Kent?

377
00:33:50,677 --> 00:33:53,100
Doctor, how is my wife?

378
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:58,674
She has a mild concussion,
but she'll be fine.

379
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:03,021
And how is our baby?

380
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:06,852
I'm sorry.

381
00:34:13,771 --> 00:34:17,040
Dad....

382
00:34:43,937 --> 00:34:46,902
Clark, what happened?

383
00:34:46,902 --> 00:34:50,680
Looks like a bomb went off.

384
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,261
Where are your parents?

385
00:34:53,261 --> 00:34:56,822
Hospital.

386
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,755
They're fine.

387
00:35:00,755 --> 00:35:03,957
My mom lost the baby.

388
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,950
The baby?

389
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,798
This is all my fault, Lana.
I did this.

390
00:35:10,798 --> 00:35:12,967
How could you do this?

391
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:15,959
The same way I always do.

392
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:18,624
I bring pain and suffering
to everyone's lives.

393
00:35:18,624 --> 00:35:19,713
Clark, that's not true.

394
00:35:19,713 --> 00:35:21,892
Yes, Lana, it is.

395
00:35:21,892 --> 00:35:24,608
Lana, I've kept so much from you.

396
00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:28,515
If you knew the truth,
you'd never talk to me again.

397
00:35:28,515 --> 00:35:31,915
I don't believe that.

398
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:37,675
I tried to cover up my past
and push it away.

399
00:35:37,675 --> 00:35:42,229
I-I couldn't.

400
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:50,982
He said if I didn't go,
everyone I love would be hurt.

401
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,619
He was right.

402
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,447
Clark, you're in shock.

403
00:35:56,447 --> 00:36:00,901
- You're not making any--
- No, Lana, stay from me.

404
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:04,933
Stay away from me
before I hurt you too.

405
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:24,052
I'm glad you finally decided
to accept my offer.

406
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:30,351
You know, don't you, you have a very
exciting future ahead of you, Miss Sullivan.

407
00:36:30,351 --> 00:36:33,922
Well, opportunities like this aren't
dropped on your doorstep every day.

408
00:36:33,922 --> 00:36:36,962
Why the sudden change of heart?

409
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:39,157
You were right about Clark.

410
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:41,097
He wasn't who I thought he was.

411
00:36:41,097 --> 00:36:42,494
Oh.

412
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:44,649
I'm surprised I hadn't noticed earlier.

413
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:47,294
So much for my crack journalistic instinct.

414
00:36:47,294 --> 00:36:51,810
No, no, love has a way of blinding
even the sharpest minds.

415
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,255
We don't look because
we don't want to see.

416
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:58,360
But once love has been stripped away,

417
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,467
then we see the real person clearly.

418
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:07,628
They're revealed to us with
all their flaws, their foibles,

419
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:11,791
and their secrets.

420
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:15,324
Oh, I've got a meeting.

421
00:37:15,324 --> 00:37:19,650
- I'm sorry to rush you out like this.
- It's fine.

422
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,303
Mr. Luthor?

423
00:37:21,303 --> 00:37:23,873
Why are you so interested in Clark?

424
00:37:23,873 --> 00:37:29,015
You don't expect me to show
you all my cards, now do you?

425
00:37:29,015 --> 00:37:33,086
No, I guess not.

426
00:37:33,737 --> 00:37:36,551
All will be revealed in good time, Miss Sullivan.

427
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:39,389
Thank you, Mr. Luthor.

428
00:37:56,822 --> 00:37:59,606
I'm here, sweetheart.

429
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,896
I'm here.

430
00:38:32,573 --> 00:38:36,427
Clark. I've been looking all over for you.
I heard what happened.

431
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:38,598
What, are you here to tell me
I screwed up in some major way?

432
00:38:38,598 --> 00:38:41,583
No. Hey, listen, I'm sorry
and I want to help.

433
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:46,477
It's too late for that, Pete.
No one can help me now.

434
00:38:48,169 --> 00:38:50,048
Clark, what are you looking for?

435
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:52,694
I know Chloe kept one of those red
Kryptonite rings around here somewhere.

436
00:38:52,694 --> 00:38:54,520
Yeah, well, what do you want it for?
You know what it does to you.

437
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,636
Yeah. It makes me feel better.

438
00:38:56,636 --> 00:38:59,646
That's not the answer, Clark.

439
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:01,877
I saw Lana.

440
00:39:01,877 --> 00:39:05,616
I heard what happened
to your mom's baby.

441
00:39:05,616 --> 00:39:07,031
Clark, you need to talk to your folks.

442
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:10,142
I did talk to my parents, Pete!

443
00:39:10,142 --> 00:39:12,540
You should have seen
the way my dad looked at me.

444
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,093
It was like I was an alien.

445
00:39:14,093 --> 00:39:19,872
If I'd have done what I should've in the
beginning, none of this would have happened.

446
00:39:30,395 --> 00:39:33,989
Clark, don't do it. When you put
that ring on, you're not yourself.

447
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:38,179
Exactly what I don't want
to be right now, Pete.

448
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:45,782
Clark!

449
00:39:52,402 --> 00:39:55,244
Clark, where are you going?

450
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:59,326
Away from here.

451
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:01,745
The Clark Kent I know wouldn't
run away from his problems.

452
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:04,817
The Clark Kent you know is a lie.

453
00:40:04,817 --> 00:40:06,415
Why won't you let me in?

454
00:40:06,415 --> 00:40:10,343
Because, Lana, you
won't like what you see.

455
00:40:13,404 --> 00:40:17,284
- I am not giving up on you.
- No on can save me.

456
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:18,176
Not even you.

457
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,697
Your parents need you.

458
00:40:20,697 --> 00:40:23,910
I need you.

459
00:40:28,456 --> 00:40:32,974
I love you, Clark.

460
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:38,097
I love you, too...

461
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:43,161
more than you'll ever know.

462
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:48,517
That's why I have to leave.

463
00:41:06,303 --> 00:41:09,401
Come with me.

464
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:13,892
Smallville's my home.
It's your home too.

465
00:41:13,892 --> 00:41:18,036
Not anymore.

466
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:50,624
Helen?

467
00:41:53,656 --> 00:41:56,802
Helen?!

468
00:42:38,998 --> 00:42:42,931
You will obey me, Kal-El.

1
00:00:01,055 --> 00:00:03,390
Previously on Smallville:

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:06,506
- I think Lex has a piece of the spaceship.
- Are you sure?

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:10,075
Roger Nixon. I'm a journalist,
and I'd like to write a story about you.

4
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:13,008
- Whitney's going off to join the Marines.
- Really?

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,238
If you're gonna take me on, son...

6
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:17,350
...you're gonna have to bring your game
up to a whole different level.

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,418
Just promise me Saturday night's
gonna be great.

8
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:20,815
It'll be a night you won't forget.

9
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,821
There's a whole lot more to your friend
Clark Kent than meets the eye.

10
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,253
You'd better pray you're not wrong.

11
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:29,056
You're not my enemy. You're my son.

12
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,995
I believe the term is, "Cry havoc
and let slip the dogs of war."

13
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,775
- Lana's there.
- Don't worry. I'm sure she's home by now.

14
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:45,207
I'll tell the entire world about your son!

15
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:55,112
Jonathan, look!

16
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,290
Damn it!

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,194
Help me!

18
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:04,689
But he knows everything!

19
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:07,766
- I will not let him destroy this family.
- No! Please!

20
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:10,063
Jonathan!

21
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,367
Clark!

22
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,808
No!

23
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,040
And now, the season premiere of Smallville.

24
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,601
Lex!

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,007
I'm your father!

26
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,878
Son!

27
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:00,809
Dad!

28
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,946
Dad! No!

29
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,374
Nixon!

30
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,885
- Give me the camera!
- Get the hell away from me!

31
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,791
Lana?

32
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,358
Lana.

33
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:41,036
I need help!

34
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,500
I need a doctor here!

35
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,841
- I need help. Now.
- What have we got?

36
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,075
Pupils are responsive.

37
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:54,251
Respiration appears normal.

38
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,088
Got a good pulse.

39
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:59,090
She's gonna be all right.
Can you tell me her name?

40
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,899
Mom! Dad!

41
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,733
Mom? Mom! Mom!

42
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,177
- I'm gonna get you to a hospital.
- No, Clark, listen to me.

43
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,647
- That reporter was in the cellar.
- Nixon?

44
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,721
He videotaped the ship.
He's gonna expose your secret.

45
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:32,448
- Your father chased him out into the storm.
- I've gotta find them.

46
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:36,362
Mom? Where's the ship?

47
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:47,273
There's swelling in his vertebrae, resulting
in partial loss of nerve control in his legs.

48
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,671
His spleen is ruptured...

49
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:52,809
...and he's sustained severe trauma
to his optic nerve.

50
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,177
I want a medevac to Metropolis General.
I want a team of specialists.

51
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,910
Your father's critical.
Moving him is not an option.

52
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,850
- This isn't just any patient.
- I know who Lionel Luthor is.

53
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:06,016
- I cannot give him any special treatment.
- That's not what I meant.

54
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:10,364
He's my father.
Do everything you can for him.

55
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:16,266
Lex.

56
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,767
Lex.

57
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,975
Yeah, Dad, I'm here.

58
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:25,807
Don't worry.

59
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,349
I'll fly in specialists from Metropolis
to personally supervise your case.

60
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,645
I saw it...

61
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,187
...in your eyes, son...

62
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:38,754
...what you were thinking.

63
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:44,290
Life would be so easy...

64
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:47,593
...if I was out of your way.

65
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:54,934
Dad, I'm sorry.

66
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:04,582
Dad!

67
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,554
- Dad!
- He hasn't been back to the house!

68
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,486
Did you call the sheriff?
The hospital?

69
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:13,249
- The phones are down.
- Dad grew up in tornado country.

70
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:17,625
- The first thing he'd do is take shelter.
- I don't know if he was thinking straight.

71
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,028
I've never seen your father that angry.

72
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:22,863
He said he wasn't gonna let Nixon
destroy our family.

73
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:25,730
Do you think he...?

74
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,338
No, he would never do that.

75
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:47,724
Oh, no! I won't say anything
about your son, I swear to God!

76
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,587
Please! Don't kill me!

77
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,465
Oh, God.

78
00:08:57,638 --> 00:09:01,301
- Oh, God. I thought you were gonna kill me.
- Yeah, you would think that.

79
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,916
- Hey, Dorothy, back from Oz?
- Chloe.

80
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:15,112
What are you doing?
Shouldn't you be in bed?

81
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:18,486
I'm okay. The doctor says
it's just a mild concussion.

82
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,158
Besides, a lot of people need this bed
a lot more than I do.

83
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,661
Well, I'm just glad you're okay.
What happened?

84
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:30,168
Well, I was driving back after dropping
Whitney off, when the wind picked up.

85
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:35,536
This mailbox slammed against
my windshield, and I went off the road.

86
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,735
That's when I saw the twisters.

87
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:42,346
- Before I knew it, the truck was sucked up.
- God.

88
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:47,146
You walked away with a small bump. That's
amazing, even by Smallville standards.

89
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:50,119
- No, it's impossible.
- What?

90
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,317
Nothing. The next thing I knew,
I was waking up here.

91
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:57,897
So you clicked your heels, said, "There's
no place like home," and ended up here.

92
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,329
Apparently Clark brought me in.

93
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:03,697
- Clark?
- Yeah, have you seen him?

94
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:07,834
No, not since he vanished from the dance.
I spent three hours looking for him.

95
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,875
Guess the Spring Formal was
kind of a bust, huh?

96
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:14,941
Yeah, well, at least now I know
where he disappeared to.

97
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:19,646
If it's any consolation,
you guys looked great together.

98
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,514
It's not, but thanks.

99
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,030
Dad?

100
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:38,001
Clark, I ran into your mother at the
hospital. She told me about your dad.

101
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:41,539
I checked every acre of this place,
I gotta head for the woods.

102
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:44,775
Clark.

103
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:49,538
My father was injured in the twister.
He's in pretty bad shape.

104
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:54,786
- Lex, I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do?
- It's in the doctor's hands now.

105
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:59,017
During the storm, my father was trapped
beneath a column.

106
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:02,026
If I hadn't pulled him out,
he would've died.

107
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:06,090
Before I did, I hesitated.

108
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,472
I was thinking that maybe my life would
be better off if I just left him to die.

109
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:17,473
- You saved him, that's the important part.
- No.

110
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:22,139
My father won't see it that way.
Forgiveness is not in his emotional lexicon.

111
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:25,581
If anything, he'll probably see
my saving him as a sign of weakness.

112
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,784
What are you gonna do?

113
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,722
Help my friend find his dad.

114
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,657
You got another flashlight?

115
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:42,830
- Dad!
- Mr. Kent!

116
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,901
Mr. Kent!

117
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,674
Dad!

118
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:17,469
- Do you know whose car that is?
- No.

119
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:20,801
I think we can cover more ground
if we split up.

120
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:22,441
Yeah.

121
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:25,669
- I'll meet you back here in a half-hour.
- Okay.

122
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,327
Great.

123
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,135
What are you doing?

124
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:51,430
Looking for my cell phone.

125
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,505
It's our only hope.

126
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:58,838
The greatest story in human history, and
I'm not gonna get a chance to write it.

127
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:01,106
Clark is not a story, he's my son.

128
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:05,048
And I'm not gonna let you sabotage
his life while you make yourself famous.

129
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:09,519
Is that why you chased me?
What were you planning on doing, Kent?

130
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,386
Were you gonna bludgeon me
and bury me in a shallow grave?

131
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,996
You were trespassing on my property,
and you tried to kill my son in that truck.

132
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:23,569
You have the most amazing being on Earth
doing chores on your farm.

133
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:29,169
Why are you hiding him? Tell the world
and let them see for themselves.

134
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:32,039
I think I should leave that up to him
for when he's older.

135
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,511
Well, when do you suppose that'll be?
Draft age? Drinking age?

136
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:36,980
When he's ready.

137
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,245
Why don't you stop playing the protector
and admit the truth.

138
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:43,584
You kept him because you couldn't
have children of your own.

139
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:47,955
We kept him because he is our son
and we love him.

140
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:51,655
He's not your son, you deluded hick!

141
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,027
He's not even human.

142
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:01,503
You can kill me for saying this,
but you know I'm right.

143
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:06,112
You're just a small man whose son's
destiny is too big for you to comprehend.

144
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:13,785
Clark doesn't belong to you.
He belongs to the world.

145
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:23,924
Hello? Lex?

146
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:27,958
Nixon? Where the hell are you?

147
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,666
You stupid son of a bitch!
I thought you wanted to get out of here!

148
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,206
I did want out of here, till I realized
you were in bed with Lex Luthor.

149
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:40,211
And I would rather rot down here than
watch the two of you destroy my son's life!

150
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:48,444
Nixon, you still there?

151
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:51,887
Just calling the fire department
so we can get a rescue team out here.

152
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,551
No, you weren't.
I heard you trying to talk to Roger Nixon.

153
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,789
He was at the farm today.
He was with my dad when the tornado hit.

154
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:00,866
Clark, I didn't know Nixon was involved.

155
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:04,470
Why should I believe you?
You already lied about knowing him once.

156
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:09,173
That's the second time you've
hesitated today.

157
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,811
Maybe what my dad said about you
is true.

158
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,276
Clark, wait.

159
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:16,974
- You're tired and upset.
- Don't try to turn this around on me!

160
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:20,245
Are you really here to find my dad,
or to find Nixon?

161
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,646
- Do you even have to ask?
- I don't have time for this.

162
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:26,554
- I've gotta find my dad.
- Clark!

163
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,659
Dad!

164
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:43,438
I'll talk to the Red Cross people...

165
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:46,512
...see if they have any new information
about your father.

166
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:48,012
Clark.

167
00:15:49,117 --> 00:15:51,278
- Any luck?
- We looked all night.

168
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:54,683
The search-and-rescue team
combed the farm but didn't find anything.

169
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:58,121
I don't know what to do,
he's been missing for over 12 hours.

170
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:01,925
You'll find him, Clark. I know it.

171
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:05,398
Thanks.

172
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:09,960
- I thought you'd be home recuperating.
- I wanted to help.

173
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:14,774
You know, a lot of people helped me out
after the meteor shower. Meant a lot.

174
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,971
I'm just glad you're okay.

175
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:22,574
So how did you find me?

176
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:27,312
I was lucky, I guess.
You were in a field next to the road.

177
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:30,355
You must have been thrown free
from the truck.

178
00:16:31,926 --> 00:16:33,553
Is that really what happened?

179
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,091
Yeah.

180
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:39,361
Why?

181
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:43,561
I just keep seeing something
that doesn't make any sense.

182
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:47,174
The truck was caught up in the tornado,
and you...

183
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:49,272
You just...

184
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:51,443
Clark.

185
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:53,744
No new word.

186
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:57,978
I'd better get back to work.
You'll find him.

187
00:16:58,453 --> 00:17:03,083
I'm gonna stay and work the phones. If
anybody's seen or found him, they'll call in.

188
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:06,385
They discovered an old couple
trapped in their garage this morning.

189
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:08,256
So there's still hope.

190
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:11,759
Dad's missing because of me.
I brought this upon us.

191
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:16,131
You can't blame yourself.
You can't change who you are.

192
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:19,273
As long as you live,
people will try to exploit you.

193
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,466
Your father and I have tried to shelter you
as long as possible...

194
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:24,941
...but one day we won't be there for you.

195
00:17:25,113 --> 00:17:27,877
You'll have to carry the burden
of your gifts on your own.

196
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:30,176
- Don't say that, Mom.
- When your day comes...

197
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:34,117
...I have no doubt in my heart
that you'll make us proud.

198
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:36,914
Now go back out there.

199
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,937
These old foundations, they mix lead in
with the cement for stability.

200
00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:55,064
- Afraid we're gonna die of lead poisoning?
- Clark can't see through lead.

201
00:17:57,044 --> 00:17:59,569
He can see through solid objects?

202
00:17:59,814 --> 00:18:02,749
Unbelievable. What else can he do?

203
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:06,009
Do you have any idea
what I'd do with his abilities?

204
00:18:06,187 --> 00:18:09,679
The wealth, the power he
could amass, it's unimaginable.

205
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:13,759
You are exactly the reason why
I keep his abilities a secret.

206
00:18:14,395 --> 00:18:16,920
If it wasn't me,
it would've been someone else.

207
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:19,658
It was just a matter of time
before the story got out.

208
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:22,826
- Yeah.
- The people have a right to know.

209
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:26,371
Without any regard to the consequences
to my son.

210
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,670
Mr. Kent...

211
00:18:30,178 --> 00:18:34,114
...since the beginning of time, people have
been looking at the stars, and wondering:

212
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:36,182
"What's out there?"

213
00:18:37,418 --> 00:18:41,047
Clark is the answer
that they have been waiting for.

214
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:49,588
- I think I know a way out of here.
- You gonna tell me what that is?

215
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:52,130
You give me the tape of the ship,
and I will.

216
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,165
That's not gonna happen.

217
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,862
It's your life or your story.

218
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,530
You've gotta decide which is
more important to you.

219
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:03,942
I have.

220
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:31,430
You gonna share your plan with me?

221
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:40,170
Feel that. Go on.

222
00:19:44,552 --> 00:19:46,417
- The mortar's weaker here.
- Yeah.

223
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:50,387
If we can get through here, I'm sure that
we can tunnel up to the surface.

224
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:03,667
- Clark.
- What do you want?

225
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:07,299
I should have come out
and told you the truth right away.

226
00:20:07,475 --> 00:20:10,535
I do know Roger Nixon.
I was just trying to protect you.

227
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,736
Protect me from what?

228
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:17,584
Before the tornado,
Nixon approached me.

229
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:20,186
He offered to sell me information
about your family.

230
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:25,252
- What kind of information?
- It doesn't matter. He's a liar.

231
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:26,859
He'll do anything for a story.

232
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:31,327
I warned him to stay away
from your family. When I saw his car, I...

233
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:35,435
I realized he might have had something
to do with your father's disappearance.

234
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:38,237
Why didn't you tell me before?

235
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:40,966
I didn't want to alarm you
unless I knew for sure.

236
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:44,168
You know, Lex, I don't know what
to believe anymore.

237
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:46,112
Believe that I'm your friend.

238
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:50,783
I've got something to show you.

239
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,419
- What's that?
- It's a map.

240
00:20:59,961 --> 00:21:02,953
A cellular frequency grid, to be exact.

241
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,291
I had my people look into it.

242
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,802
Only one cell tower survived the storm,
meaning Nixon, and possibly your father...

243
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:13,031
...had to be within a one-mile radius of
where we were last night.

244
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:15,835
I don't know if it will help,
but it's worth a shot.

245
00:21:17,545 --> 00:21:20,343
- Mr. Kent!
- Dad!

246
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:25,645
- Well, this is the edge of the grid.
- There are no structures marked on the map.

247
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,447
Sorry, Clark.

248
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:30,122
Wait, what's that?

249
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:33,023
The twister must have dropped it here.

250
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:50,206
- He's not in here.
- What are you, part bloodhound?

251
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:53,404
Yeah. How do you know? Mr. Kent!

252
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,948
Dad!

253
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:58,111
Mr. Kent!

254
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,776
- Did you hear that?
- It's the kids. Chloe! Pete!

255
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:02,513
- Help!
- We're down here!

256
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,456
They can't hear us! They can't.
I gotta keep on digging. Go!

257
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:09,594
Roger, take it easy! It's not stable
down here.

258
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,997
I got your legs!

259
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,699
Hang on!

260
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:21,934
Did you hear something?

261
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:34,521
Come on, let's start again.

262
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:38,280
- Mr. Kent?
- Dad!

263
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:07,452
Here we see a terrifying example
of the tornado's fury.

264
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:09,522
This truck was literally ripped apart.

265
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:13,060
Incredibly, the young driver, Lana Lang,
survived.

266
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:17,756
Reminding us that, even in the midst
of utter devastation, miracles can happen.

267
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:20,662
It must have been awful for you.

268
00:23:21,102 --> 00:23:25,129
Yeah. I don't think I've ever been
that scared in my entire life.

269
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:27,501
I'm glad you're all right.

270
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:31,677
Thanks for all your help, Mrs. Kent.

271
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,680
- I know it must be hard for you right now.
- I'm a saint.

272
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:40,478
I just can't believe how familiar
all this feels.

273
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:43,021
- The meteor shower?
- Yeah. God.

274
00:23:43,191 --> 00:23:46,854
- I remember it like it was yesterday.
- Yeah, me too.

275
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:49,895
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to dredge up bad memories.

276
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:52,464
It's okay. For so long it seemed
to define me.

277
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:55,660
That fairy princess picture
on Time magazine.

278
00:23:56,671 --> 00:24:01,438
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
you made one wish come true that day.

279
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:05,238
Jonathan and I were in Nell's buying
flowers, right before the meteor shower...

280
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,811
...and you were sitting on the counter
with your wings and wand...

281
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:12,578
...and you asked me if I wanted
to make a wish, so I did.

282
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:16,048
And not long after that,
Clark came into our lives.

283
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:21,184
I've never even told Clark that story.

284
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:27,958
Clark is so lucky to have you and Mr. Kent
as parents.

285
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:32,564
I've always been kind of envious.
You seem so open.

286
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:36,807
I'm glad that you and Clark
have become close.

287
00:24:37,512 --> 00:24:39,480
Yeah. Me too.

288
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:47,444
- Mr. Kent!
- Mr. Kent?

289
00:24:49,057 --> 00:24:50,581
Mr. Kent!

290
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:52,517
Chloe?

291
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:56,821
I've been wanting to apologize
for leaving you at the formal.

292
00:24:56,998 --> 00:25:00,559
Didn't I tell you that leaving in the
middle of a tornado to save a friend...

293
00:25:00,735 --> 00:25:02,532
...totally gets you off the hook?

294
00:25:02,704 --> 00:25:06,299
- Besides, I know you'd do the same for me.
- Oh, in a heartbeat.

295
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:08,738
So how can I make it up to you?

296
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,844
Actually, you know, I've been thinking.

297
00:25:11,012 --> 00:25:14,209
It's funny how a natural disaster
puts your life in perspective.

298
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:17,545
But I think it might be better
if we just stay really good friends.

299
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:20,517
Anything other than that
just gets too complicated.

300
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:27,359
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

301
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:29,762
- You do?
- Yeah.

302
00:25:30,465 --> 00:25:35,334
Yeah, our friendship is so important to me,
the last thing I want to do is screw it up.

303
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:41,899
Good. Great. Perfect. I'm really glad
we got that straightened out.

304
00:25:42,944 --> 00:25:44,275
I'm gonna check over here.

305
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:48,074
Okay, I'll catch up in a sec.
My feet are throbbing.

306
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:01,357
Mr. Kent!

307
00:26:01,763 --> 00:26:03,526
- Hey.
- Hey.

308
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:08,124
- What's up with the fake smile?
- Nothing.

309
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,501
Clark and I just reaffirmed
that we're really good friends.

310
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:14,504
And nothing else.

311
00:26:17,545 --> 00:26:21,140
- Pulled the "friends" card on you, huh?
- No, I did.

312
00:26:21,316 --> 00:26:23,307
Defense mechanism.

313
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,453
Listen, Chloe...

314
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:29,483
...it's okay to feel bummed out.

315
00:26:29,824 --> 00:26:32,224
Last night was supposed to be special...

316
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:34,986
...and it got ruined.

317
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,865
It was just so close to being perfect.

318
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:45,702
Listen to me, I sound so pathetic.
A tornado hit, people are in real trouble...

319
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:51,038
...and I'm upset because Clark
didn't fulfill my wish-fulfillment fantasy.

320
00:26:52,614 --> 00:26:55,139
You must think I'm an awful person.

321
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:58,783
Yeah, you're a real monster.

322
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:00,452
Come on.

323
00:27:06,327 --> 00:27:08,124
I can't breathe.

324
00:27:09,998 --> 00:27:13,263
The cave-in must have cut off
the air supply.

325
00:27:25,647 --> 00:27:29,413
Dying in a tomb, that's ironic.

326
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:34,019
At least you've got a legacy
to leave behind.

327
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,288
That's something to be proud of.

328
00:27:40,628 --> 00:27:43,358
First time Clark used his abilities...

329
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:48,099
...he'd crawled under...

330
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:52,371
...a big oak bed that my grandfather
had made, and I...

331
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:57,170
I crawled underneath to try and get
him out, and then, all of a sudden, the...

332
00:27:57,345 --> 00:28:00,007
The frame just came up in the air.

333
00:28:02,116 --> 00:28:07,782
He was a toddler lifting, I don't know what
it was, 500 pounds over his head.

334
00:28:07,955 --> 00:28:09,217
What did you do?

335
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,326
We decided to take him to a doctor
or a scientist.

336
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:16,389
Somebody more equipped...

337
00:28:17,265 --> 00:28:19,460
...to understand than we were.

338
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:26,037
But when we got in front of the office,
Martha said that if we left him there...

339
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:32,334
...that they would want to keep him,
and we'd never see him again.

340
00:28:34,182 --> 00:28:36,173
So I took him home.

341
00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:40,852
Now, that may have been a mistake.

342
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:47,319
But it was a mistake
I'd gladly make again.

343
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:53,064
Time is of the essence.

344
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:56,863
The spine may heal, but the optic nerve
will get worse if it goes untreated.

345
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,872
- So surgery's the only option.
- No, I recommend against this.

346
00:29:01,042 --> 00:29:04,443
I say, let the patient's condition stabilize
before surgery is attempted.

347
00:29:05,113 --> 00:29:08,742
Yes, surgery's risky, but the alternative
could be worse.

348
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:12,242
It's your decision.

349
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,647
Do it.

350
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:16,622
Fine.

351
00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:20,858
Where'd you get these maps?

352
00:29:21,028 --> 00:29:23,553
My mom borrowed them
from the county planner's office.

353
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:25,961
They list every zoning change
going back to 1920.

354
00:29:26,134 --> 00:29:29,968
Look, the plans from 1988 show
an old church near Hobson's Pond.

355
00:29:30,138 --> 00:29:33,505
- I've never seen a church there.
- It was destroyed in the meteor shower.

356
00:29:33,775 --> 00:29:36,107
According to this,
there's a crypt in the basement.

357
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:38,404
Your dad could have known about it.

358
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:42,683
I was right there. The motor home must
have been concealing the entrance.

359
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,581
Clark! You can't dig him out
on your own.

360
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:51,248
Clark, Pete and I'll go into town. We'll get
a rescue team and meet you out there.

361
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:52,854
Okay!

362
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:23,314
- Dad!
- Clark!

363
00:30:23,491 --> 00:30:25,482
- Dad!
- Clark.

364
00:30:36,204 --> 00:30:38,695
Kent, what's happening to him?

365
00:30:38,873 --> 00:30:40,966
You gotta get him away
from the meteor rocks.

366
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:43,300
They make him sick.

367
00:30:44,045 --> 00:30:46,536
Come on, get him out of here!

368
00:30:51,652 --> 00:30:53,449
What are you doing?

369
00:30:55,423 --> 00:30:58,358
I don't need the tape. I got all
the evidence I need right here.

370
00:30:58,526 --> 00:31:00,187
What are you doing?

371
00:31:01,395 --> 00:31:05,297
Nixon! You don't understand!

372
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:06,865
The rocks...

373
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:08,834
Clark...

374
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,480
Oh, son of a...

375
00:31:31,792 --> 00:31:33,453
You're not...

376
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:36,561
...taking my son!

377
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,780
Like I said, the people have
a right to know.

378
00:32:00,288 --> 00:32:02,779
And unlike you, Mr. Kent...

379
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:06,358
...I am willing to kill
for what I believe in.

380
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:24,310
Clark.

381
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:30,044
- Mr. Kent, are you okay?
- Yeah.

382
00:32:33,087 --> 00:32:34,679
Son.

383
00:32:34,855 --> 00:32:36,720
You've gotta help me.

384
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:46,932
Clark, are you okay?

385
00:32:48,536 --> 00:32:50,265
I'll survive.

386
00:33:09,157 --> 00:33:11,921
Your dad's got a cracked rib,
but he'll be all right.

387
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:14,584
Well, like you said, he's a survivor.

388
00:33:14,763 --> 00:33:17,732
And so are you. I never realized
how strong you were until today.

389
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:19,628
Thanks, Clark, but I was terrified.

390
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:22,770
You didn't show it.
You were like super mom.

391
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:24,665
Dad, how you feeling?

392
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,272
Thank you.

393
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:29,442
Kind of like a house fell on me.
That's how I feel.

394
00:33:30,045 --> 00:33:35,142
- Dad, I'm glad that you didn't, you know...
- What, kill Nixon?

395
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:40,919
I have to admit, it was the hardest thing I
ever did, took every fiber of my being.

396
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:45,355
But I started thinking about you and what
your Mom and I've tried to teach you.

397
00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:48,860
I realized if I had done that,
Nixon would have won.

398
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,089
It's a good thing Lex was there.

399
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:52,965
Clark.

400
00:33:54,302 --> 00:33:58,830
Nixon told me that Lex offered
to pay him for information on us.

401
00:34:00,408 --> 00:34:02,808
Lex told me he warned Nixon
to stay away.

402
00:34:04,012 --> 00:34:06,606
One of them is lying, son.

403
00:34:09,718 --> 00:34:13,484
The question you need to ask yourself is,
which one tried to kill you...

404
00:34:13,655 --> 00:34:15,953
...and which one saved your life?

405
00:34:18,393 --> 00:34:21,089
If I have any more questions,
I'll give you a call.

406
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:25,028
- Thanks. Mr. Kent.
- Lex.

407
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,263
- Look...
- Lex...

408
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:37,374
You saved my life,
and I want to say thank you.

409
00:34:43,752 --> 00:34:45,185
To a fresh start.

410
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:51,652
Yeah.

411
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:55,888
Clark.

412
00:35:58,026 --> 00:36:00,961
Your mom told me what happened
with you and Lana in the tornado.

413
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:04,155
The only person who was there,
and I can't even share it with her.

414
00:36:04,332 --> 00:36:07,597
Well, son, I'm here, you can share it
with me if you want.

415
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:12,933
Dad, I've survived a lot.

416
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:15,805
Being inside that twister...

417
00:36:15,977 --> 00:36:18,275
I've never been so scared in my life.

418
00:36:18,446 --> 00:36:22,177
I couldn't see anything. Things were
bouncing off me. I didn't have any control.

419
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:25,815
It could've been the wind,
but I moved toward the truck...

420
00:36:25,987 --> 00:36:28,956
...and it felt like I was willing myself
to do it.

421
00:36:32,627 --> 00:36:34,652
It felt like I was flying.

422
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:46,029
Lex.

423
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:49,734
Lex.

424
00:36:49,911 --> 00:36:51,242
Dad?

425
00:36:53,414 --> 00:36:54,972
Dad.

426
00:36:55,149 --> 00:36:56,741
How are you?

427
00:36:57,585 --> 00:36:59,485
The doctors won't tell me
what's going on.

428
00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:03,886
I know. I wanted to tell you myself.

429
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:09,119
There's every chance
I'm gonna get back...

430
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:11,532
...the full use of my legs.

431
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:16,494
Well, that's great news. Isn't it?

432
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:20,368
I need to say something to you.

433
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:24,641
If I've acted ruthlessly...

434
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:29,715
...it was because I knew my opponents
wouldn't hesitate to do the same.

435
00:37:30,051 --> 00:37:34,988
I know you've always seen us
as opponents.

436
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:39,421
Lex, when I needed help...

437
00:37:42,263 --> 00:37:44,527
...you saved my life.

438
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:48,066
And I thank you, son.

439
00:37:49,304 --> 00:37:50,862
Listen.

440
00:37:51,873 --> 00:37:55,809
I know you agreed to go right ahead...

441
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:59,913
...right away, to operate.

442
00:38:00,515 --> 00:38:05,452
- I thought it best to take immediate action.
- I would have done the same thing.

443
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,554
And we both...

444
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,358
...would have been wrong.

445
00:38:15,697 --> 00:38:17,756
What are you saying?

446
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:23,901
I'm blind.

447
00:38:24,072 --> 00:38:26,540
The operation failed.

448
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:28,835
And that's not going to change.

449
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:32,673
It would have been better
if you had not helped me.

450
00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:35,907
If you'd let me...

451
00:38:37,251 --> 00:38:39,014
...die.

452
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:44,649
Lex?

453
00:38:49,063 --> 00:38:50,360
Lex.

454
00:38:56,037 --> 00:38:57,527
Lex.

455
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:04,937
What are you doing, Clark?

456
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,510
- Thinking.
- Looks like you're hiding.

457
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:12,885
I just can't wait for things
to get back to normal.

458
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:15,589
It won't.

459
00:39:16,457 --> 00:39:17,719
Why do you say that?

460
00:39:17,892 --> 00:39:20,759
Nell used to tell me that
after the meteor shower.

461
00:39:21,496 --> 00:39:23,191
But these events change you.

462
00:39:23,364 --> 00:39:27,664
Wipes out your illusions.
You discover things about yourself.

463
00:39:27,835 --> 00:39:29,928
What'd you discover?

464
00:39:30,338 --> 00:39:33,705
I've always had this sense
that I was going to die young.

465
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:37,776
Maybe because of my parents.
Felt guilty I'd survived.

466
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:44,817
When the tornado came,
I thought...

467
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,315
...this was it, fate had finally found me.

468
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:53,021
Then I saw you in the truck...

469
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:57,722
...and you put your arms around me and
told me everything was going to be okay.

470
00:39:58,766 --> 00:40:00,700
I know, it sounds crazy.

471
00:40:00,868 --> 00:40:05,669
But I started to think of all the other
times you've been there to protect me.

472
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:09,502
I thought, "Maybe there's more
to Clark Kent than meets the eye."

473
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:21,155
You're right. It does sound crazy.

474
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,217
There's nothing more to me
than what you see.

475
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:28,660
Clark.

476
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:33,065
You know you can tell me anything, right?

477
00:40:34,836 --> 00:40:38,328
I know, Lana.
But I wasn't in that truck.

478
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:42,131
Then how did I survive?
It doesn't make any sense.

479
00:40:44,112 --> 00:40:46,444
Maybe you just weren't meant
to die young.

480
00:40:50,685 --> 00:40:52,585
Just remember:

481
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:56,522
You can't hide out here forever.

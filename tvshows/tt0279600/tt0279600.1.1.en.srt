1
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,838
This has got to stop.
Open your eyes, Lex!

2
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,241
I can't!

3
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,813
Luthors are not afraid!

4
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,817
We don't have that luxury.
We're leaders.

5
00:00:56,456 --> 00:01:01,826
You have a destiny. You'll never
get anywhere with your eyes closed.

6
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,232
Abracadabra.

7
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,338
- Afternoon, Nell.
- Jonathan!

8
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,340
Martha. What a surprise.

9
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,080
What brings the reclusive
Kents to town?

10
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,873
Tulips. Red ones, if you have them.

11
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,915
What about a tiger orchid?

12
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,385
No, thanks. Martha has
her heart set on tulips.

13
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,951
Yes, well, they are a very
uncomplicated flower.

14
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,927
That's a beautiful dress, Lana!
Are you a princess?

15
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,136
- I'm a fairy princess.
- Where are her parents?

16
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,466
They're at the homecoming game.
I'm being the good aunt.

17
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,539
Do you want to make a wish?

18
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,210
I would love to make a wish.

19
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,812
Abracadabra.

20
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,787
I know what you wished for.

21
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:16,601
I see a little face.
It's all I ever wanted.

22
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,977
Hey, looks like Smallville won again.

23
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,439
Lex? Son?

24
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,508
Now, where do I sign?

25
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,372
Right here, Mr. Luthor.

26
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,025
- Help me.
- Huh?

27
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,889
Help me, please.

28
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,193
Hey, kid...

29
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,696
Help me.

30
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,828
Help me, please.

31
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,203
What on God's Earth...?

32
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,276
Hi, Lana!

33
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,137
Mommy! Daddy!

34
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,335
What's happening, Jonathan?

35
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:56,850
Lex! Lex! Where are you?

36
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,009
Lex? Lex?

37
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,697
Martha?

38
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,824
Kids don't just fall out
of the sky, Martha.

39
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:47,430
- Then where did he come from?
- I don't know.

40
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,464
But he must have parents.

41
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:57,836
If he does, they're
definitely not from Kansas.

42
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,079
Sweetheart, we can't keep him.

43
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:11,017
What'll we say?
We found him in a field?

44
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,123
We didn't find him.

45
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,420
He found us.

46
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,059
Clark, you're gonna be late!

47
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,562
Coming, Mom.

48
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,405
- Ah, ah!
- It tastes better from the bottle.

49
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,736
- Where'd you learn your manners?
- On a farm.

50
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,174
Afternoon, sleepyhead.

51
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,750
I have class tonight so you two are
on your own. And no pizza!

52
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,190
There's food in the fridge.

53
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,391
Hey, what you got there, son?

54
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:22,924
Permission slip.

55
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:28,757
It's for the football team. They're
having tryouts this afternoon.

56
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,198
- You played football, Dad.
- That was different.

57
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,597
- Why?
- You know why.

58
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,700
I'll run at half speed-

59
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,902
Lot of things can happen
in the heat of the game.

60
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,071
Most new guys hardly even play.

61
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:49,085
Chances are I'll ride the bench
half the season. I can be careful.

62
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,953
I know you can be careful,
but what if there's an accident?

63
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:07,268
Look, Clark, I know this has gotta
be really hard for you...

64
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,407
...but hang in there like we promised.

65
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,470
I'm sick of hanging in there.

66
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,237
All I wanna do is go through high school
without being a total loser.

67
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,167
I can't believe you bet against him.

68
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:48,379
If the clock moved
any slower, he'd be extinct.

69
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:14,274
- So did anyone ask you to the dance?
- Not yet.

70
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,035
Maybe you and I could go.

71
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,473
Not as a date thing,
more of a friend thing.

72
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,571
Hi, guys.

73
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:24,578
Didn't you just-?
Weren't you-?

74
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,718
- I took a shortcut.
- Through a black hole?

75
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:34,157
You'll have to excuse our reporter.
Her "weirdar" is on Defcon 5.

76
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,223
Just because everyone ignores
the strange things that go on...

77
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:40,731
...doesn't mean they don't happen.

78
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,100
We'd love to join you and
Scooby for another zany adventure...

79
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:48,866
...but we need to hand in these
slips before homeroom.

80
00:11:49,212 --> 00:11:53,581
I'm having second thoughts.
I don't think it's a good idea.

81
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,283
This is the only way.

82
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:59,248
Wait. You two are trying
out for the football team?

83
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:03,219
What is this, some
sort of teen suicide pact?

84
00:12:05,728 --> 00:12:07,923
We're trying to avoid
being a scarecrow.

85
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:11,961
What are you talking about,
and why the whispering?

86
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:16,331
It's tradition. Before the game,
the players pick a freshman...

87
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,665
...take him and paint
an S on his chest.

88
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:24,106
- String him up like a scarecrow.
- Sounds like years of therapy.

89
00:12:24,347 --> 00:12:26,178
That's why we're trying out.

90
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:28,940
They won't choose one of their own.

91
00:12:36,158 --> 00:12:39,025
- I'll see you guys in class.
- Bye.

92
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:43,994
- Give him 10 seconds.
- Five.

93
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:49,364
One, two, three, four, five.

94
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:53,873
Statistical fact.

95
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,873
He can't get within 5 feet
of Lana Lang...

96
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:59,511
...without turning into
a freak show.

97
00:13:00,349 --> 00:13:01,714
Nietzsche.

98
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,687
Didn't realize you had
a dark side, Clark.

99
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,155
- Doesn't everybody?
- Yeah, I guess so.

100
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:18,859
So, what are you, man or superman?

101
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:24,402
- Haven't figured it out yet.
- Lana. There you are.

102
00:13:27,376 --> 00:13:28,638
Hey, Clark.

103
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:33,211
I was wondering if you
could do me a favor.

104
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:37,680
Could you check my English paper?
I didn't finish until 2 a. m.

105
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:42,048
- I'm not sure about the ending.
- I'll bet it's great.

106
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,057
Dude. Are you feeling all right?

107
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:52,700
- You look like you're about to hurl.
- I'm fine.

108
00:13:58,174 --> 00:14:00,005
You forgot one, Clark.

109
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:21,724
Payback time.

110
00:14:48,531 --> 00:14:49,862
Thanks, Dad.

111
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:05,609
Ready! Down! Set! Hike!

112
00:15:12,355 --> 00:15:18,487
<i>Red and gold no doubt
We're here to win one out</i>

113
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:30,092
Clark! How do I look?

114
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,124
Like a tackle dummy.

115
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,031
Good luck.

116
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,027
Come on, don't die on me!

117
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,007
I could've sworn I hit you.

118
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:32,078
If you did, I'd be...

119
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,879
I'd be dead.

120
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,130
Clark!

121
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,606
- Son, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

122
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,300
- Who's the maniac driving the car?
- That would be me.

123
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,204
Lex Luthor.

124
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,716
I'm Jonathan Kent. This is my son.

125
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,716
Thanks for saving my life.

126
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,751
I'm sure you'd have done the same.

127
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:17,762
You have an extraordinary boy.
If there's any way I can repay you-

128
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,295
You could drive slower.

129
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,374
My aunt'll be back any minute.

130
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,518
Oh, come on!
We're living on the edge.

131
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:20,282
If Aunt Nell finds us here,
your life won't be worth living.

132
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,690
- Where is she anyway, bridge club?
- Lex Luthor's.

133
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,224
I didn't know your aunt was in
with the Luthors.

134
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,992
She sold them a ton of land.

135
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,605
They own the Metropolis Sharks.
She could put in a good word.

136
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,832
If you want a good word, ask Clark.

137
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:41,201
- He saved Lex's life today.
- You're kidding.

138
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:45,005
Sometimes people can surprise you.

139
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,185
I think it's kind of cool.

140
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:53,055
Coach said a scout from Kansas State
is coming to the game on Saturday.

141
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,587
That's great.

142
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:59,389
I don't want to be a "Remember him?"

143
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,225
Smallville's got enough of those guys.

144
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,803
I want you to wear this to the game.

145
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,541
I can't take this.

146
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,306
You can give it back after you win.

147
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:21,709
Is it really made from a piece
of the meteor that, you know...?

148
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,755
So much bad luck came out of it...

149
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,458
...there can only be good luck left.

150
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,686
Jeez, kid! Scared the crap out of me.

151
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,301
Don't I know you?

152
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:22,780
You look like that scarecrow kid.
Where the hell you been?

153
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,841
Hey, freakazoid, wake up.

154
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:41,322
That was 12 years ago, man.
That was just a game.

155
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,666
What do you want?

156
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,403
To play.

157
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,756
- Hey, Mom, whose truck?
- Yours.

158
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,886
It's a gift from Lex Luthor.

159
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,830
"Dear Clark: Drive safely.
Always in your debt...

160
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,737
...the maniac in the Porsche. "

161
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,605
I don't believe it.
Where are the keys?

162
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,111
Your father has them.

163
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:50,694
I know how much you want it, son,
but you can't keep it.

164
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:55,101
- Why not? I saved the guy's life.
- So you deserve a prize?

165
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,671
That's not what I meant.

166
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:02,234
How about you drive the new one,
and I'll drive the old one?

167
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:06,010
- Everybody wins.
- It's not about winning, Clark.

168
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:11,854
It's not like the Luthors
can't afford it.

169
00:23:14,264 --> 00:23:18,701
Clark, I know you're upset, son,
but it's normal.

170
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:22,300
Normal?

171
00:23:25,676 --> 00:23:28,042
How about this?
Is this normal?

172
00:23:34,785 --> 00:23:38,721
I didn't dive in after Lex's car.
It hit me at 60 mph.

173
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:44,219
Does that sound normal to you?
I'd give anything to be normal.

174
00:24:09,987 --> 00:24:11,579
It's time, son.

175
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:15,692
Time for what?

176
00:24:17,561 --> 00:24:19,688
The truth.

177
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:27,331
I want you to take a look
at something.

178
00:24:28,772 --> 00:24:34,233
I think it's from your parents.
Your real parents.

179
00:24:39,016 --> 00:24:40,449
What does it say?

180
00:24:40,617 --> 00:24:42,261
I tried to decipher it for years,

181
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,645
but it's not written in
any language known to man.

182
00:24:46,123 --> 00:24:48,284
What do you mean?

183
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:54,958
Your real parents weren't exactly
from around here.

184
00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:57,156
Where are they from?

185
00:25:06,844 --> 00:25:11,008
What are you trying to tell me dad?
I'm from another planet?

186
00:25:14,518 --> 00:25:18,318
I suppose you stashed
my spaceship in the attic.

187
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,985
Actually, it's in the storm cellar.

188
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:31,496
This is how you came
into our world, son.

189
00:25:31,835 --> 00:25:34,167
It was the day of the meteor shower.

190
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:37,162
This is a joke, right?

191
00:25:43,714 --> 00:25:46,683
Why didn't you tell
me about this before?

192
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:50,946
- We wanted to protect you.
- Protect me from what?

193
00:25:51,154 --> 00:25:53,054
You should have told me.

194
00:25:53,724 --> 00:25:56,989
Clark. Clark!

195
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,179
- Who's there?
- It's me.

196
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,115
Clark.

197
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:24,246
Clark Kent?

198
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:27,455
What are you doing
creeping around the woods?

199
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:30,249
You'd never believe me if I told you.

200
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:33,889
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

201
00:26:35,032 --> 00:26:36,294
Clark, wait.

202
00:26:37,034 --> 00:26:40,868
Just wasn't expecting
to see anyone out here.

203
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:42,300
Are you okay?

204
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,973
I'm hanging out in a graveyard.
Does that strike you as okay behavior?

205
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:51,408
Hey, I'm here too.

206
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,083
Good point. What's your story?

207
00:27:01,024 --> 00:27:03,219
Can you keep a secret?

208
00:27:04,962 --> 00:27:07,590
I'm the Fort Knox of secrets.

209
00:27:08,398 --> 00:27:09,763
I...

210
00:27:10,534 --> 00:27:14,061
...came out here
to talk with my parents.

211
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:21,068
You must think I'm pretty weird,
conversing with dead people.

212
00:27:22,112 --> 00:27:25,377
I don't think you're weird, Lana.

213
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,645
Do you remember them?

214
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,281
They died when I was 3.

215
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:33,751
I'm sorry.

216
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,083
It's not your fault, Clark.

217
00:27:37,894 --> 00:27:40,795
Come on, I'll introduce you.

218
00:27:44,134 --> 00:27:46,125
Mom, Dad?

219
00:27:46,336 --> 00:27:48,668
This is Clark Kent.

220
00:27:49,306 --> 00:27:51,103
Say hi.

221
00:27:51,341 --> 00:27:53,036
Hi.

222
00:27:54,745 --> 00:27:57,407
Yeah, he is kind of shy.

223
00:27:58,081 --> 00:28:00,641
How should I know?

224
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:05,420
Mom asks if you're upset about a girl.

225
00:28:08,658 --> 00:28:13,152
- Dad asks if it's about a guy.
- No, no.

226
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:16,696
He has a twisted sense of humor.

227
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,330
Seriously, Clark.

228
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:25,501
Why are you out here?

229
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:30,510
Ever feel like your life was
supposed to be something different?

230
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:37,782
Sometimes I dream I'm at school,
waiting for Nell to pick me up.

231
00:28:38,055 --> 00:28:39,613
But she doesn't come.

232
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:44,589
My parents drive up and they're
not dead, they're just really late.

233
00:28:44,795 --> 00:28:50,734
I get in their car and we drive back
to my real life in Metropolis.

234
00:28:50,934 --> 00:28:52,868
That's when I wake up.

235
00:28:53,904 --> 00:28:58,432
And for a minute, I'm totally happy.

236
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:02,401
Until I realize I'm still alone.

237
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:12,010
What's that, Mrs. Lang?

238
00:29:14,157 --> 00:29:16,819
Yeah, I'll tell her.

239
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:20,328
Your mom wants you to know
you're never alone.

240
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:25,561
That she's always looking over you.
No matter what.

241
00:29:29,706 --> 00:29:31,867
What's that, Mr. Lang?

242
00:29:33,076 --> 00:29:36,477
Your dad thinks you're a shoo-in
for homecoming queen.

243
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,977
They really say all that?

244
00:29:42,552 --> 00:29:47,649
Oh, they're quite chatty
once you get them started.

245
00:29:53,597 --> 00:29:55,497
Thanks for walking me home.

246
00:29:55,699 --> 00:29:57,929
Beats creeping around the woods.

247
00:29:59,436 --> 00:30:03,736
You realize this is the longest
conversation we've ever had?

248
00:30:04,274 --> 00:30:06,242
We should do it again.

249
00:30:06,443 --> 00:30:07,774
Yes, we should.

250
00:30:11,248 --> 00:30:13,273
So are you going to the dance?

251
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:15,542
Yeah, with Whitney.

252
00:30:15,752 --> 00:30:18,380
Right, of course.

253
00:30:19,256 --> 00:30:20,621
How about you?

254
00:30:22,192 --> 00:30:24,456
No, figured I'd sit it out.

255
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:29,930
If you change your mind...

256
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,930
...I might save you a dance.

257
00:30:36,907 --> 00:30:39,034
Good night, Clark.

258
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:07,497
Hello?

259
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:13,671
Hello?

260
00:31:32,596 --> 00:31:33,927
Clark?

261
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:36,322
I didn't see you.

262
00:31:36,866 --> 00:31:39,426
I buzzed, but no one answered.

263
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,397
How'd you get through the gate?

264
00:31:42,572 --> 00:31:44,938
Kind of squeezed through the bars.
If this is a bad time-

265
00:31:45,108 --> 00:31:50,341
No, I think Heiki has sufficiently
kicked my ass for the day.

266
00:31:50,614 --> 00:31:52,377
This is a great place.

267
00:31:53,016 --> 00:31:56,563
If you're dead and in the
market for something to haunt.

268
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:57,885
I meant it's roomy.

269
00:31:59,108 --> 00:32:01,474
How's the new ride?

270
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,804
That's why I'm here.

271
00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:07,038
What's the matter?
You don't like it?

272
00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:10,377
No, it's not that.
I can't keep it.

273
00:32:11,454 --> 00:32:16,221
Clark, you saved my life.
I think it's the least I can do.

274
00:32:18,828 --> 00:32:20,921
Your father doesn't like me.

275
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:25,427
It's okay. I've been
bald since I was 9.

276
00:32:25,668 --> 00:32:29,297
- I'm used to people judging me.
- It's not personal.

277
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:32,167
He's just not crazy
about your dad.

278
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:36,109
Figures the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree?

279
00:32:36,312 --> 00:32:37,973
Understandable.

280
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:40,975
What about you, Clark?

281
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,908
Did you fall far from the tree?

282
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:52,259
I'd better go.
Thanks for the truck.

283
00:32:54,296 --> 00:32:55,524
Clark?

284
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,130
Do you believe a man can fly?

285
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,366
Sure, in a plane.

286
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:04,606
I'm not talking about that.

287
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:08,608
I'm talking about soaring
with nothing but air beneath you.

288
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,873
- People can't fly, Lex.
- I did.

289
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:17,615
After the accident,
when my heart stopped.

290
00:33:17,887 --> 00:33:23,154
It was the most exhilarating
two minutes of my life.

291
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,854
I flew over Smallville.

292
00:33:28,164 --> 00:33:30,962
And for the first time...

293
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,964
...I didn't see a dead end.

294
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,061
I saw a new beginning.

295
00:33:39,546 --> 00:33:42,344
We are the future, Clark.

296
00:33:42,782 --> 00:33:46,946
I don't want anything to stand in
the way of our friendship.

297
00:33:56,129 --> 00:34:00,657
- That's the third guy.
- And they're all former jocks.

298
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:05,333
- Who's the weirdo?
- I don't know.

299
00:34:05,572 --> 00:34:08,564
Let's check him out.

300
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:11,902
His name's Jeremy Creek.
This is a picture of him 12 years ago.

301
00:34:12,178 --> 00:34:15,807
- This I took four hours ago.
- That's impossible.

302
00:34:16,082 --> 00:34:18,277
He'd be 26.
Must be a kid who looks like him.

303
00:34:18,485 --> 00:34:21,682
My money was on the evil twin theory,
until we checked this missing persons.

304
00:34:21,922 --> 00:34:24,417
Jeremy disappeared from the state infirmary
 a few days ago,

305
00:34:24,452 --> 00:34:26,156
where he'd been in a coma for 12 years.

306
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:28,821
They say he's suffering from
massive electrolyte imbalance.

307
00:34:29,029 --> 00:34:31,361
- That's why he hasn't aged a day.
- So you're telling me he just woke up?

308
00:34:31,531 --> 00:34:32,930
No, there was a huge electrical storm.

309
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:37,068
The hospital's generator went down,
and when it came back on, Jeremy was gone.

310
00:34:37,337 --> 00:34:39,498
Electricity must charged him up
like a Duracell.

311
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:43,402
And now he's back in Smallville,
putting former jocks into comas. Why?

312
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:48,343
Because 12 years ago today, they chose
Jeremy Creek as the scarecrow.

313
00:34:48,615 --> 00:34:51,778
"Comatose boy found in few 20
yards from meteor strike. "

314
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:54,831
The exposure to the blast must
have done something to his body.

315
00:34:54,854 --> 00:34:57,113
No, this can't be right.

316
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:02,191
- I think you ought to show him.
- Show me what?

317
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:13,630
It started out as a scrapbook
and just kind of mutated.

318
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:15,069
What is it?

319
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,401
I call it the Wall of Weird.

320
00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:23,206
It's every strange, bizarre and unexplained event 
that's happened in Smallville since the meteor shower.

321
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,113
That's when it all began.
The town went schizo.

322
00:35:29,255 --> 00:35:33,885
- What do you think?
- Why didn't you tell me about this?

323
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,427
Do you tell me everything that happened in
your life? We all keep secrets, Clark.

324
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:51,267
Lana?

325
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,448
It's all my fault.

326
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,094
Chloe, just leave me alone.

327
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:17,170
Congratulations, Clark.
You're this year's scarecrow.

328
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,843
- Don't mess with me right now.
- Come on, bring it on!

329
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,085
- What's with you and Lana?
- Nothing.

330
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,960
Like her necklace? Huh?

331
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:45,224
Good, because it's as close
as you'll ever get to her.

332
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,201
Never changes.

333
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:24,869
Help me.

334
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,934
Hurts, doesn't it?

335
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,716
You're Jeremy.

336
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:36,079
I thought if I punished
them, it'd stop.

337
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,015
But it never stops.

338
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:44,785
Wait.

339
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,291
Where are you going?

340
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:50,261
Homecoming dance.
I never made it to mine.

341
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:54,027
Get me down. Please?

342
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,400
You're safer here.

343
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:16,654
Help me.

344
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,296
Help me.

345
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,271
Clark?

346
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,619
Oh, jeez.

347
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,081
Who did this to you?

348
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,450
Doesn't matter.

349
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,325
You need to see a doctor.

350
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:02,972
- I'll be okay.
- At least let me give you a ride.

351
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:44,707
Jeremy, you need to stop this.

352
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,118
I don't know how you got here.

353
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:59,360
- You should have stayed away.
- I won't let you hurt my friends.

354
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:02,259
Those people aren't your friends.

355
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,958
The sprinklers will get them nice and wet.
I'll handle the rest.

356
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,501
- They never did anything to you.
- I'm not doing this for me.

357
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,731
I'm doing this for you and
for the others like us!

358
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:15,475
What happened to you was my fault.
I can understand your pain.

359
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,806
I'm not in pain.

360
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,812
I have a gift...

361
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:23,714
...a purpose and a destiny.

362
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,319
So do I.

363
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,694
Give it up, Jeremy.

364
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,665
Are you okay?

365
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:46,631
Who are you?

366
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,433
Where am I?

367
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:56,807
I'm Clark Kent,
and you're in Smallville.

368
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,578
I want to go home.

369
00:42:52,652 --> 00:42:55,712
I didn't see you tonight, Clark.

370
00:42:57,323 --> 00:42:58,620
Lana.

371
00:43:01,528 --> 00:43:03,689
What are you doing here?

372
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:09,467
I saved you that dance.

373
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:33,315
Is everything okay, Clark?

374
00:43:36,429 --> 00:43:38,488
It's perfect.

375
00:44:02,922 --> 00:44:05,413
Thanks for the dance, Lana.

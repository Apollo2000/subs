1
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,337
Lex...

2
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:43,400
...I thought we had an arrangement.
Why this sudden urge for a face-to-face?

3
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,477
You don't look well.

4
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,281
Why did you pull me away from
my research? I hate progress reports.

5
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:55,047
I hear you're having
personnel problems at Cadmus Labs.

6
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,055
They quit when you turned violent,
started throwing equipment.

7
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,160
No. They were incompetent.
I thought our relationship was clear.

8
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:04,229
You write the checks,
I have free rein to do my work.

9
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,559
I hired you to research the meteor rocks.

10
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,259
Instead of results,
you provide potential lawsuits.

11
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:12,099
Frankly, doctor, you've become a liability.

12
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:17,337
Look, I'm afraid we've reached
the end of our road together.

13
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:20,378
Now that I'm running my own company,
I don't have time...

14
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,607
...to pursue projects that don't bear fruit.

15
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:26,445
I suggest you see a doctor.
I'll take care of the expenses.

16
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,851
I don't need your doctor,
and I sure don't need your condescension.

17
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,457
It's you who needs me.
You're just a little too...

18
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:35,427
...myopic to see it.

19
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,974
Hey, man. Are you all right?

20
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,745
Clark, you're dreaming if you think
you're gonna make a basket from there.

21
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,676
No, no, the ball rolled out here.

22
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:19,709
- Wanna play a game of horse?
- Forget it. We're borrowing your dad's truck.

23
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,355
- For what?
- I'll explain on the way. There's no time.

24
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:26,015
- What's going on?
- You gotta see it with your own eyes.

25
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,664
Pretty mind-blowing, huh?

26
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,603
What do you think it is?

27
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:45,003
Oh, Clark, it's a spaceship.
What the hell else would it be?

28
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:49,240
I didn't know if it was some downed
specialty aircraft or a Russian satellite.

29
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:52,614
No, no, no, this thing's got
extraterrestrial written all over it.

30
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:56,690
I bet there's little green guys
running around the cornfield too.

31
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,753
I'm serious, Clark.
Have you ever seen anything like it?

32
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,887
If aliens came, they'd find a place
more exciting than Smallville.

33
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:07,398
No, no, think about it.
Crop circles, cattle mutilation.

34
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:11,629
They'd be like kids in a candy store here.
Come on, man, let's load it into the truck.

35
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:14,434
- Wait, you're not just gonna take it.
- Clark.

36
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:18,476
When the sheriff questioned me, I told him
I couldn't remember where the truck...

37
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:22,047
...went off the road, but it's only
a matter of time before he shows up.

38
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,017
Come on.

39
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,584
- Come on.
- All right, we'll take it to my house.

40
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,587
No, Clark. I know your dad.

41
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:33,955
- He'll make us give it to the authorities.
- He won't know it's there.

42
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:46,071
Clark, last time I checked,
I found this thing.

43
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,368
You're acting like you got license
and registration on it, man.

44
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,408
Lighten up. We're taking it to my place.

45
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,252
Right here.

46
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,419
Lex?

47
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,825
- Are you in here?
- Yeah, Dad, I'm right here.

48
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:16,135
I'm sorry, I wasn't expecting you.

49
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,771
No. Get out.

50
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:21,966
Is everything all right?

51
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,012
Doctors tell me
your recovery's going well.

52
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,343
Oh, it is. So well, in fact, that...

53
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:31,644
...Dr. Rawlings suggested I...

54
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,613
...take a break from the...

55
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,717
...rigors of...

56
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:38,148
...physical therapy. He...

57
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,883
He thought that some time away from the...

58
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:44,926
...stress of living and working
in Metropolis would be more...

59
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,730
...beneficial right now.

60
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:50,402
And of all the places
you could have gone...

61
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:53,874
...you decided to come here?
- We'll have a chance for some...

62
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:58,568
...father-son bonding. You've always told
me I've been lax in that department, Lex.

63
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,636
How long you planning to stay?

64
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,339
A few days. Maybe a week.

65
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,421
Are you sure you wouldn't be
more comfortable at the beach house?

66
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,880
I think the sea air would be invigorating.

67
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:16,420
I'm getting the distinct impression, Lex,
that you don't want me here.

68
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:20,893
No, Father, I just want what's best for you.

69
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,402
Stay as long as you like.

70
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,051
No.

71
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,086
Hey, Lana, I was just thinking...

72
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:51,322
...if you moved those tables away from the
counter, it'd open up space for extra stools.

73
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,934
- More customers, more cash flow.
- That's a wonderful idea, Dean.

74
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,402
I gotta go.

75
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,607
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

76
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,905
- Bye, Lana.
- Bye.

77
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,748
- Isn't he wonderful?
- Yeah. He's great.

78
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,223
- Hi.
- Hey.

79
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,382
- Hi, Chloe.
- Hi.

80
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:23,154
Oh, how did the sleepover go?
Did you two get a lot of studying done?

81
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:27,122
I have to be completely honest
with you, Nell.

82
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:33,405
We didn't study.
We had a Keanu DVD-a-thon.

83
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:38,676
Once you get lost in those brown eyes,
geometry loses its appeal.

84
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,414
Well, I'm just glad you two had fun.

85
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,447
Don't let the grades suffer.

86
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,451
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

87
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,424
Thank you so much, Chloe.

88
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,321
Sure. If you'd given me a heads-up...

89
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:56,986
...I could've come up with something
a lot better than a Keanu DVD-a-thon.

90
00:09:57,164 --> 00:10:01,601
Sorry, I had to get out of the house, so
I told Nell I was staying at a friend's place.

91
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,101
You were the first person
that came to mind.

92
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:05,965
- Really?
- Really.

93
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,300
So where were you last night?

94
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,603
Is there a new guy in Lana Lang's life?

95
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:15,575
Yeah. His name's Dean.
You passed him on the way in.

96
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,211
- You're dating an older man?
- Relax.

97
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:22,617
He's Nell's boyfriend. He's an insurance
adjuster she met after the tornado.

98
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,453
He's always around, and they're in this
lovey-dovey daze all the time.

99
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:29,891
Yeah, and you want to tell them
to get a room, but it's her house.

100
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:33,693
After I caught them slow dancing,
I decided to stay at the Talon.

101
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:37,303
Next time you need to clear out of the
love shack, you don't have to lie.

102
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,564
You can stay at my house for real, anytime.

103
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,002
Thanks.

104
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,683
- This thing weighs a ton.
- I know.

105
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:58,983
- I'm gonna go call Chloe.
- Wait, wait, don't.

106
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,254
Why not? To her, this thing's
like the Holy Grail.

107
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:05,895
- She'll write an article.
- That's the point. We'll be famous.

108
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,591
We'll write a book,
go on all sorts of talk shows...

109
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,702
...and then we'll sign a big movie deal.

110
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,668
Don't you think we should keep this
between us till we know more?

111
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:17,174
Why are you gun-shy? We gotta
move before the driver tells someone else.

112
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:21,610
Suppose we tell Chloe and it turns out to be
some high-tech crop-duster or something.

113
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,510
She'll never let us live it down.

114
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:27,711
Exactly. We'd be the subject of her next
"Eat Crow" column for sure.

115
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,147
I don't know about you,
but I'm not willing to risk it.

116
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:33,020
Well, how do you think you open it?

117
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:36,257
I'm not sure. Here.

118
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:40,728
You work on that. I'm gonna go see if
anyone's put up "missing spaceship" flyers.

119
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,665
- I'll meet you back here tomorrow morning.
- All right, cool.

120
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,635
So where is it now?

121
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:50,276
- In Pete's tool shed.
- He hasn't told anyone about it?

122
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,878
I convinced him to hold off
the press conference.

123
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,446
Very funny.
We're just gonna have to get it back.

124
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:57,846
What are we gonna do, Dad, just steal it?

125
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,147
- What if he asks me where it went?
- You'll have to play dumb.

126
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,086
- I'm sick of lying.
- You don't have much of a choice here.

127
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,227
- Well, I can tell Pete the truth.
- Clark.

128
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:08,725
He's not gonna tell anyone.

129
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:12,127
Look, people slip sometimes,
even the most trustworthy of friends.

130
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,290
This information is too dangerous for Pete.

131
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:17,062
We understand that this secret
is a huge burden...

132
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,966
...but if you share it with Pete...

133
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,905
...you might be giving him
a responsibility he's not ready to take on.

134
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:30,943
I know this isn't the type of bizarre cellular
mutation I normally call you with...

135
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,881
...but I knew you'd be interested.
- What's the room number?

136
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:38,046
You know, the interest
on my med-school loans is killing me.

137
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,696
- You really should have that looked at.
- What's the number?

138
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,204
Who are you?

139
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:02,111
Dr. Hamilton. How do you feel?

140
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,342
Like my head got bashed in by a bulldozer.

141
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:10,815
Dr. Glenn tells me you saw a spacecraft
in a cornfield last night?

142
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:13,489
Must have been babbling.

143
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,295
They got me pumped full of morphine.

144
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,397
Who else did you babble to?

145
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,868
- What's it to you?
- Let's say I have a professional interest.

146
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:27,735
I went to the field, I saw the impression in
the cornstalks. Whatever made it is gone.

147
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,736
Damn.

148
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,610
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.

149
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:38,981
- Someone must have taken it.
- You did see a ship last night?

150
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:44,919
Who else knows about it?

151
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,650
No one.

152
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,126
Oh, the kid, the one who
pulled me out of my truck.

153
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,768
Pete Ross.

154
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:01,234
- Have we met before?
- I don't think so.

155
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,270
You were out on the road last night.

156
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,275
You're the crazy son of a bitch
who forced me off the road.

157
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:17,781
Nurse!

158
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,157
What are you doing?

159
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,897
Nurse!

160
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,644
I don't believe it.

161
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,317
Someone must have gotten here before us.

162
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,887
Well, we're not gonna find out
who it was tonight.

163
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,276
Pete.

164
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,418
- Hey, I was just gonna come talk to you.
- Really?

165
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,415
About the ship...

166
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,753
Someone broke into my shed
last night and stole it.

167
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,285
- Really?
- Yeah.

168
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,959
Did you tell anyone it was there?

169
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,098
No. Did you?

170
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:38,502
- No, my lips have been sealed.
- You're such a liar.

171
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:42,164
- What do you mean?
- I saw you and your dad driving away.

172
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:47,141
I kept telling myself, there's gotta be some
explanation. Clark Kent would never do this.

173
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,381
Pete, I swear, we didn't take the ship.

174
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,383
And all these years,
I used to think you were my best friend.

175
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:55,849
Pete, wait. You don't understand.

176
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:58,719
What don't I understand?
Go ahead, explain it to me, Clark.

177
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:04,226
That's good, really illuminating.

178
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:07,125
Wait till Chloe hears about this.

179
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:11,266
I can already see the headlines:
"The Real Clark Kent Exposed."

180
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,896
Pete, we need to talk.

181
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,239
So you're some sort of...?
What, you're not a human?

182
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,438
I don't know what I am.

183
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,137
I don't know where that ship brought
me from. I grew up in Smallville...

184
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,145
...and everything and everyone
that I care about is here.

185
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,444
If you care about me,
how come you never told me?

186
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:03,487
Believe me, I've always wanted to tell you.
My parents thought it was too dangerous.

187
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:07,457
- Not just for me, but for anyone who knew.
- You didn't think I could handle it?

188
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,859
Can you?

189
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,131
Another reason I didn't say anything...

190
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:22,434
...is because I knew people would
look at me the way you're looking at me.

191
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,474
- Yeah, how's that?
- Like a freak.

192
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,181
Pete, I've tried my whole life
just to blend in.

193
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,082
I've tried to be more normal
than anyone else.

194
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,582
Look, just say something.

195
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:41,888
Call me... Call me an alien, call me
a monster. I don't care, just say something.

196
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,864
It's like I don't even know you.

197
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:51,437
Yes, you do. I'm the same kid
who used to camp in your backyard.

198
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:56,599
We used to ride bikes, play basketball
with your brothers. Nothing has changed.

199
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,107
- Yeah, right.
- Pete.

200
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,577
Back off, man.

201
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,487
Pete, I would never hurt you.

202
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:10,990
Too late.

203
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:37,139
There it is. Right there.

204
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:41,219
Listen, I thought I made it clear
that our business together was over.

205
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:45,654
I've come for my severance package. The
octagonal disk that I found in the field, Lex.

206
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:48,386
- Why?
- What does it matter to you?

207
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,894
I don't have it.
It disappeared during the storm.

208
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,828
Liar! It's a key! I know you have it!

209
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,460
This isn't over.

210
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:13,482
- Mr. Luthor?
- Yes.

211
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,177
I'm Dr. Steven Hamilton.

212
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,516
I've been doing
confidential research on the...

213
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,453
...meteor rocks for your son
at Cadmus Labs.

214
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,686
All right, you've got my attention.

215
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:25,661
Well, unfortunately, Lex has become...

216
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:30,002
...shortsighted and impatient.
We've severed our relationship. But you...

217
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,502
You have a reputation as a...

218
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:35,438
- A man of vision.
- Apparently, doctor...

219
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,440
...you haven't noticed that I'm blind.

220
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:40,972
A man like you doesn't have to have eyes
to see the future...

221
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,705
...or to recognize a opportunity.

222
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:46,011
- Don't flatter me. Get to the point.
- I discovered something that...

223
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:50,748
...can only be described as earth-shattering,
and I'd like to show it to you.

224
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,326
Come on.

225
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,191
Hey, Pete.

226
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,870
Look, I know you freaked out.

227
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,131
Don't you think
I freak myself out sometimes?

228
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:12,903
All right, look, you have every reason
in the world to hate me...

229
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,138
...but I need to find that ship.

230
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,176
The guy you pulled out of the truck
must've told someone. I thought maybe...

231
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:26,849
The other day, when we were moving the
ship, you said it was heavy. You were lying.

232
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,819
You'd miss the bus and end up
at school ahead of me.

233
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,861
You said you got a ride,
but you never got rides, did you?

234
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,831
Our whole life, you were the person
I could tell anything...

235
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:40,769
...and I did, all my secrets. But you,
everything you ever told me was a lie!

236
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,067
Maybe I was right in not telling you,
the way you're reacting.

237
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,774
Clark, you don't get it, do you?
I don't care if you're from the moon.

238
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:50,416
You never trusted me.
What kind of friendship is that?

239
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,451
Hey, guys. Why didn't you tell me
about the superhero deal?

240
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:02,089
Pete pulls a guy from a mangled truck
and rushes him to the hospital?

241
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:05,395
That's got Torch exclusive
written all over it.

242
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,763
So how about an interview?

243
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,333
Maybe later.

244
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:12,198
Your reluctance wouldn't be part of
a vast conspiracy...

245
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:15,239
...designed to cover up a whole
spaceship thing, would it?

246
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:17,842
- What?
- My source from the medical center called.

247
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:23,142
He said the guy was rambling on about
some spacecraft that landed in a cornfield.

248
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,181
You don't really believe that, do you?

249
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:28,344
I don't know, not unless
Pete can corroborate the story.

250
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:31,081
Sure, Chloe, I saw a spaceship.

251
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,390
- I even met an alien.
- Really?

252
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:38,855
- Would you like to describe it?
- Actually, he looks a lot like Clark.

253
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:44,163
I thought aliens were little and green.

254
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,840
I guess things aren't always
what you think they are.

255
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:53,771
Okay, what's up with him?

256
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,110
It's just guy stuff.

257
00:21:56,516 --> 00:22:00,384
You're not really looking into this story,
are you? It sounds like Inquisitor stuff.

258
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:03,818
Maybe, but if there is some truth to it,
that's front-page news...

259
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:05,651
...for the Daily Planet.

260
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:25,978
- Lex?
- Your mom said it would be okay if I waited.

261
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:27,443
Yeah, what's up?

262
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:31,449
I just needed to get out of the mansion.
It's getting crowded.

263
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:37,488
- Doesn't it have, like, 75 rooms?
- Well, my father takes up a lot of space.

264
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,023
When's he going back to Metropolis?

265
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:44,961
Not soon enough.

266
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,558
Is he really being that difficult?

267
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:51,363
Just the opposite.
He's the picture of civility.

268
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,972
Says he wants to work on our relationship.

269
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,005
Is that such a bad thing?

270
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:01,810
He's lied to me so many times, it's hard to
believe he doesn't have an ulterior motive.

271
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:05,549
- Maybe give him the benefit of the doubt.
- No, no.

272
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,915
If a person's deceived me, I find it hard
to give him a second chance.

273
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:15,694
By the way, you remember that paperweight
I had on my desk, the octagonal one?

274
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:18,989
Kind of, why?

275
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:21,599
Came up today,
made me wonder what happened to it.

276
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,593
- When did you lose it?
- During the storm.

277
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:30,205
Probably got carried away with all the
other debris from the mansion. You know?

278
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,046
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.

279
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,145
Good luck.

280
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,690
Forgive my skepticism, doctor,
but for all I can tell, this could be...

281
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,228
...a postmodern coffee table.

282
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:54,834
Why should I believe you
that it's a spacecraft?

283
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:58,562
The alloy you're touching is composed
of elements not on the periodic table.

284
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,865
Certain chemicals in that alloy
are present in the meteor rocks.

285
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,370
Get me the proof.

286
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,877
Here.

287
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,113
- Feel this?
- Yeah.

288
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,578
There's a piece missing.

289
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:13,947
Lex and I were investigating a meteor site,
and I found an octagonal-shaped disk...

290
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,385
...that is the exact size and shape
of that impression.

291
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:19,957
- And you think it was...?
- It was a key...

292
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:23,254
...that opens the ship and will provide
the proof you're asking for.

293
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:26,125
Unfortunately, Lex won't give it back to me.

294
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,632
- Maybe Lex doesn't have the disk anymore.
- Where else would it be?

295
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:33,067
If you can answer that question, doctor...

296
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,600
...you just might get your funding.

297
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:53,787
Lana?

298
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,556
What are you doing?

299
00:24:56,729 --> 00:25:00,358
Just using your telescope to see
if it's safe to go home.

300
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,857
Hiding from Nell.

301
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,935
Her new boyfriend, Dean.

302
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:07,830
Oh, you're not crazy about him.

303
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:13,606
Oh, long story short, not really. But I'm a
terrible liar, so I've moved on to avoidance.

304
00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:17,376
Well, you've come to the right place.

305
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,652
What's wrong?

306
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,523
Have you ever had anyone resent you
for telling them the truth?

307
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:32,926
Yeah.

308
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:37,366
Whitney, when I told him how I felt
and we broke up.

309
00:25:41,174 --> 00:25:45,042
Wow, you really did it. I didn't think
you'd follow through on that.

310
00:25:48,448 --> 00:25:51,008
So do you think you'll ever be friends again?

311
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,618
Someday.

312
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:57,278
I hope. I just wish I'd been honest
with him sooner.

313
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:03,351
Yeah, Pete and I, we had a big blowout.
I don't know if our friendship is gonna last.

314
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:05,655
What did you guys fight about?

315
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,396
I wish I could tell you.

316
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,401
Typical.

317
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:13,969
What?

318
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,108
Clark Kent starts a discussion...

319
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:19,208
...about telling the truth, no less...

320
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:23,873
...and when it's his turn to open up,
everything is suddenly a deep, dark secret.

321
00:26:25,218 --> 00:26:27,516
Well, the stuff about Pete
is kind of personal.

322
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,788
Unlike what I just told you about Whitney.

323
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:36,422
Have you ever thought that some people are
more comfortable opening up than others?

324
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:39,429
I don't think it's ever comfortable
for anyone.

325
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:45,366
But if you care about somebody,
you owe it to them.

326
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:49,435
Then you should talk to Nell,
tell her how you really feel.

327
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,076
You're right, Clark.

328
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:54,506
Hiding the truth only keeps people apart.

329
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:26,143
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

330
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,146
- There's a piece missing.
- You stole the spaceship?

331
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:34,343
It's octagonal in shape, the size of my palm.
Tell me where it is!

332
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,954
I know you. You're Dr. Hamilton.

333
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:40,058
You don't know
who you're messing with!

334
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:43,252
That spaceship belongs
to someone a lot tougher than you...

335
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:48,028
- You know who it belongs to.
- Look, I don't know anything.

336
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:49,600
Tell me. Tell me who it is!

337
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:08,149
I checked the papers, the police wires and
UFO sites. There's no mention of the ship.

338
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:10,585
I don't know if that makes me
relieved or worried.

339
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:14,659
I was thinking about Ray Wallace.
If Pete visited him before he died, maybe...

340
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:17,022
Maybe he told Pete something
that could help us.

341
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,629
I assume it's a possibility.

342
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,332
Clark, I want you to talk
to Pete one more time.

343
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,496
I can't.

344
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:25,463
Why?

345
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:29,908
Pete's not speaking to me.

346
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:33,538
What happened?

347
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:38,707
Look, I don't want you guys
to freak out, all right?

348
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:42,678
But I told Pete.

349
00:28:43,623 --> 00:28:45,113
Everything.

350
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:50,052
- I didn't have a choice. He saw us...
- What do you mean?

351
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,357
- You could have come to us first.
- And come up with another lie?

352
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:57,526
Clark, at least tell us
Pete's not gonna tell anybody else.

353
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:02,001
I'm not sure what he's gonna do.
He's upset.

354
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,974
Hello.

355
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:09,678
No, he's not here.

356
00:29:10,283 --> 00:29:13,980
Oh, no.
Okay, whatever we can do. Bye-bye.

357
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,483
That was Pete's mother.
He's missing.

358
00:29:29,702 --> 00:29:32,170
This is a wonderful idea, Lana.

359
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:36,701
I realize we haven't had much time alone
since I started seeing Dean.

360
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:40,306
Actually, that's kind of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

361
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,876
- Dean's a really, really great guy. It's just...
- Let me guess.

362
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:49,047
You liked the tables the way they were.

363
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:52,248
Am I that transparent?

364
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,756
Well, I've already had a long talk with Dean,
and I told him you're very independent...

365
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:59,989
...and before he goes offering
any more unsolicited advice...

366
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:03,533
...he should...
Well, he should get to know you better.

367
00:30:03,703 --> 00:30:06,069
Thanks, Nell, I really appreciate that.

368
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,630
Lana, your feelings
are very important to me...

369
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:12,409
...and they're important to Dean too.

370
00:30:12,612 --> 00:30:15,410
That's why we'd both like
to spend more time together.

371
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,572
The three of us, as a family.

372
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:20,251
Family.

373
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:25,757
Lana, Dean didn't want me to say anything
until we were all together...

374
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,856
...but, well, you know me,
I can never keep a secret.

375
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,695
Lana, Dean's asked me to marry him.

376
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:38,326
- What did you say?
- I said yes.

377
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:49,339
The spaceship, I need to know!

378
00:30:50,383 --> 00:30:51,873
Are you gonna tell me...

379
00:30:52,485 --> 00:30:53,747
...who this belongs to?

380
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:58,587
Look, man, I was just fronting.
I was trying to scare you.

381
00:30:58,758 --> 00:31:01,386
- I have no clue whose ship that is.
- You're lying!

382
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:06,056
Look, you're sick.

383
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:09,361
Just let me go!
I'll bring back help.

384
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:12,060
Sure. You think anyone's gonna help me?

385
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:14,933
The doctors don't even have a name
for what's killing me!

386
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,870
- You're dying?
- Yes.

387
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,135
But not before I prove I am not some...

388
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:23,043
...sideshow freak, a quack doctor who sells
meteor rocks on the side of the road.

389
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:27,083
And if you don't tell me what I want
to know, then you're dying too!

390
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:35,617
Hamilton reports finding large
concentrations of meteor fragments...

391
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:40,255
...spread over a large area
south of County Highway 17.

392
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,867
These fragments vary in circumference...

393
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:47,802
...from 24 microns five to 500
and 62 millimeters.

394
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:49,703
Interesting reading, Dad.

395
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:54,509
Lex.
I didn't hear you come in.

396
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:56,573
I'm surprised.

397
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:01,110
Dr. Rawlings says he's seen improvement in
your other senses since you lost your sight.

398
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:02,720
You spoke to Rawlings?

399
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:06,988
Imagine my surprise when he told me how
worried he was that you'd gone AWOL...

400
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,060
...and missed your last several
physical-therapy sessions.

401
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:13,263
In fact, he says the worst thing
for you right now...

402
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:16,026
...is to be away from your care providers.

403
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:23,002
Do you have any idea how degrading it is
to be poked and prodded by therapists?

404
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,643
How demeaning it is to be told...

405
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:30,646
...by a Braille instructor, "One day, one day,
all this will feel natural"?

406
00:32:31,884 --> 00:32:34,409
You want the truth, Lex?

407
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:41,086
I was tired of being treated like an object,
an invalid. I had to get away from that.

408
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:49,657
You thought a couple days of oedipal
mano a mano would make you feel better?

409
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:55,967
Your analogy's apt but flawed, Lex.
Blind Oedipus was the son, not the father.

410
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:00,044
I'll go back to Metropolis.

411
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:05,647
So your sudden interest in Dr. Hamilton
was really just a coincidence?

412
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:07,883
I admit, I find his work...

413
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:10,215
...intriguing.
- He's sick, possibly delusional.

414
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:14,416
Never underestimate the value
of eccentrics and lunatics, Lex.

415
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,720
Every Arthur needs his Merlin.

416
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,894
Hamilton said that he found
some sort of...

417
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,525
...disk and that you had it.

418
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,170
- He's mistaken.
- Oh, even so...

419
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:30,035
...I think it may have been a bit rash
to terminate his contract.

420
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,935
Why do you say that?

421
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:37,640
Have you taken a look
in the good doctor's barn lately?

422
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:45,947
Hey, Chloe, have you seen Pete?

423
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,650
No, but the weird-o-meter
just kicked up another notch.

424
00:33:48,828 --> 00:33:50,318
Hospital visitor log.

425
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,123
Yeah, I was looking into
Ray Wallace's death.

426
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:57,358
It turns out he had a visitor just before
he flatlined. A Dr. Steven Hamilton.

427
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,969
- The meteor freak?
- Yeah.

428
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,729
- I thought he left.
- So did I.

429
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:04,069
So Pete plays good samaritan,
Dr. Hamilton visits the patient...

430
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,006
Patient dies and Pete disappears.

431
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:08,146
It's not exactly smoking gun, but...

432
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:10,441
It's good enough.
I'm gonna check out Hamilton.

433
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:15,383
He used to have a place down on
Allentown Road, maybe he's back there.

434
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:18,017
Clark?

435
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,215
Clark?

436
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,989
Clark?

437
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:35,004
- What are you doing?
- See how my hand spasms?

438
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,699
It's from prolonged exposure
to the meteor rocks.

439
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,500
I'm gonna give you...

440
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:43,341
...a dosage that's gonna make my tremors
look like a mild twitch.

441
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:45,177
I told you I didn't know anything!

442
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,151
I think you're lying.
You're protecting someone.

443
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,312
- I hope whoever it is, is worth dying for!
- All right!

444
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:55,156
You want me to talk,
here's what I have to say.

445
00:34:57,463 --> 00:35:01,490
Take that needle and stick it wherever,
because I'm not telling you a damn thing!

446
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:22,514
Pete!

447
00:35:22,755 --> 00:35:25,918
- Put the needle down!
- Not till he tells me what he knows.

448
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:50,139
Clark.

449
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,310
- What's wrong?
- I'm allergic to the meteor rocks.

450
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,384
This ship is yours, isn't it?

451
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:05,155
Open it!
Open it!

452
00:36:05,865 --> 00:36:07,196
Open it!

453
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:22,878
Clark, come on!

454
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:35,019
We gotta get you out of here.

455
00:36:36,095 --> 00:36:37,926
We have to help him!

456
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,539
It's too late, he's dead. Come on.

457
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,274
We gotta get the ship.

458
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:11,925
So does it do anything?

459
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:14,691
We hoped we might
find some answers inside about Clark...

460
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:16,664
...but we haven't been able to open it.

461
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,702
Clark, look.

462
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:26,073
I know I sort of went postal
when all this started...

463
00:37:26,946 --> 00:37:29,312
...but after what happened to Hamilton...

464
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,506
...I realized why you never told me...

465
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:34,115
...and I'm sorry.

466
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:40,417
Well, I guess you had a good reason
to be upset.

467
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,526
We're just glad you weren't hurt.

468
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:45,056
There's still one thing.

469
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:47,262
Hamilton tried to kill me, and...

470
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:49,864
...he could have told the whole world
about you...

471
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:51,969
...but you still tried to save him.

472
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:56,363
I couldn't let you die to protect my secret,
and I can't let anyone else die either.

473
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,237
No matter who they are.

474
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,011
Man...

475
00:38:03,082 --> 00:38:05,107
...it's not easy being you, is it?

476
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:09,116
Well, good thing is, I got my best friend
to watch my back.

477
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:10,945
Pete...

478
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,822
...I'm proud of you.

479
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:19,695
But I hope you realize what a tremendous
responsibility knowing this secret is.

480
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:24,568
And believe me,
it's not gonna get any easier.

481
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:28,534
That's my dad's way of saying,
"Welcome to the family."

482
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:50,025
Does it look anything like
Hamilton's description?

483
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,626
What he says it was?

484
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:01,464
There's nothing here, Dad.

485
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,333
They must have moved it.

486
00:39:05,144 --> 00:39:06,441
Or someone took it.

487
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:10,446
- Come on. The helicopter's waiting.
- No, I'm not going back, not just yet.

488
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:13,915
- What about your treatment?
- I'm afraid those physical therapists...

489
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:15,849
...will just have to come to me.

490
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:19,718
I hope you're not staying because of
a sudden interest in alien spacecraft.

491
00:39:19,892 --> 00:39:21,154
Of course not.

492
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:25,990
I'm staying because I want to spend
more quality time with my only son.

493
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:29,061
Good, because this could all be a hoax.

494
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:33,170
Hoax or not, I'm not the only one
who's suddenly interested in it.

495
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:40,640
So this super-speed thing, how fast
we talking? Twenty, 30 miles per hour?

496
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:42,678
Yeah, something like that.

497
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:49,146
What about the x-ray? Have you
used it to look through a girl's...?

498
00:39:49,321 --> 00:39:52,779
It only works when I focus, and I do not
use it to invade people's privacy.

499
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,026
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

500
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:59,452
So you're telling me, never once
have you looked in the girls' locker room?

501
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:01,322
Well...

502
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,893
...maybe once.
- That's my boy.

503
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,800
So you been holding back
on the court?

504
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:09,235
A little bit.

505
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:13,440
So, what are we waiting for?
Show me what you got.

506
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:17,013
- I don't think you want to go there, Pete.
- Bring it on.

507
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:20,951
- All right.
- Now, we all know...

508
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,021
...if I guard you,
you're not getting near this hoop.

509
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,250
I don't care what kind
of powers you got, let's go.

510
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:47,741
This is gonna be fun.

1
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,906
Twenty-four hour plumbing is a myth.

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,607
I've called every plumber in town.
No one can come before tomorrow morning.

3
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:20,117
By that time you'll need a snorkel.
Let me see what I can do.

4
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:22,681
Oh, wrong way.

5
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:28,190
The threads are history.
I need a wrench!

6
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,869
How did you do that?

7
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:48,914
I just kept twisting and turning
and it stopped.

8
00:00:55,623 --> 00:01:00,287
Maybe one day I'll figure out how
Clark Kent does the things he does.

9
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,630
You know the people
who moved into your house?

10
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:10,693
They have this orange cat
that comes by the loft sometimes.

11
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:14,272
I try to talk to him, but he's not
half the conversationalist you are.

12
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,002
I have to admit,
I do miss those sunsets.

13
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,540
Yeah.

14
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,480
The sky's not really the same
when you see it alone.

15
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,519
It's getting late.

16
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,349
Yeah.

17
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,458
I should go put this back.

18
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:48,706
Any news from the military?

19
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:55,375
I'm really worried.
Whitney's been missing for over a month.

20
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:59,041
The military even sent back
his personal effects to his mom.

21
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,248
She gave me my necklace back.

22
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:21,171
You gonna start wearing that again?

23
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,035
Doesn't feel right.

24
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:27,178
Have to know he's safe first.

25
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,884
If anyone can get through it, Whitney can.

26
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,646
Thank you.

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,829
Aceh Province, Indonesia

28
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:55,172
This is pointless, Fordman.
They think we're dead.

29
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,367
We're gonna make it back home,
you hear me?

30
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,206
I'm gonna get back to see...

31
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,541
Lana? I know.

32
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,149
If I have to hear about Lana,
or Smallville...

33
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,583
...or horseback riding in the
freaking meadow one more time...

34
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:11,282
Move it! Move it!

35
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:24,167
- Keep moving!
- We're not gonna make it!

36
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,902
I got one flare left!
We just gotta make it to that ridge.

37
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,636
The scouts'll see it from there.

38
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,011
You all right?

39
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,982
Oh, my goodness!
You're okay. You're okay.

40
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,549
Come on, get up.

41
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,491
Come on, keep moving. Come on.

42
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,193
Don't you guys think you're
overreacting a bit?

43
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,962
Not really. You spend your life thinking
you know the truth about someone...

44
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,264
...only to find out
that it may be a total lie.

45
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,773
They named the phone company after him.
Now Miss Biserri's telling us...

46
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,343
...Alexander Graham Bell
snaked somebody else's invention?

47
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,980
I haven't been this
disillusioned since I found out...

48
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,548
...that Betsy Ross didn't
design the American flag.

49
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,709
I mean, she was my role model.

50
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,820
Betsy Ross was your role model?

51
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,684
Yeah. In first grade.

52
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,883
I mean, one day she was a pioneer
for women, and then the next...

53
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,652
...she's a glorified seamstress.

54
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,889
One by one, our heroes are being defrocked.

55
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:39,199
You know, Lana, there's a winter festival
in Grandville this weekend.

56
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,841
My mom's gonna have
a booth there for her produce.

57
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,500
I was thinking maybe
we could go and hang out.

58
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,646
I'm not sure.

59
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,976
I have to take a couple of
extra shifts at the Talon.

60
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,846
I know you're worried...

61
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,352
...but working yourself to the bone
won't bring Whitney back any faster.

62
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,615
It's okay to have a little fun.

63
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,317
You're right.

64
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:02,962
So you'll go.

65
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,098
Yeah. Yeah, count me in.

66
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,273
Whitney.

67
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,048
I missed you so much.

68
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:03,485
I can't believe you're here.
I can't believe you're back.

69
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,911
Wow. It certainly is nice to hear
some good news for a change.

70
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,072
Mrs. Fordman must be so relieved.
That's wonderful.

71
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,808
Yeah.

72
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,678
Why do I get the impression that you
won't be the grand marshal...

73
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:39,087
...at Whitney's homecoming parade?
- I'm happy he's okay, I really am.

74
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,893
It's just...

75
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,462
I know this sounds selfish...

76
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,697
...but things were just starting
to get better between me and Lana...

77
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,895
...and now he's back.
- I thought Lana and Whitney had broken up.

78
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,508
So did I. But now she's throwing
him a party tonight at the Talon.

79
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,169
And you're going, right?

80
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,609
I don't know if I can stomach
seeing them together again.

81
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,580
Clark.

82
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,877
You need to put your
personal feelings aside, son.

83
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:12,218
Whitney risked his life for this country,
and he deserves a hero's welcome.

84
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:22,593
It's so nice to have things back to normal.

85
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:26,569
My son and the prettiest girl
in school together.

86
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,906
I bet you thought you'd never see me again.

87
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,649
I never gave up hope.

88
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,950
When I was out there, lost...

89
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:46,081
...the thought of seeing you again
was the only thing that kept me going.

90
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,860
What is it? What's wrong?

91
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,936
Whitney, you know
that video letter I sent you?

92
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,572
Video letter? What did it say?

93
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,541
Lana, there's something
you need to know about me.

94
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,848
When my platoon was ambushed...

95
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,785
...I was caught in an explosion...

96
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,585
...and when I woke up,
some of my memory was wiped out...

97
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,456
...and the doctors don't know
if I'll ever get it back.

98
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,656
Whitney, it's okay.

99
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:31,067
The one thing that I'll never forget
is how much I care for you.

100
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,605
I just want things to be
like they used to be.

101
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,054
Sorry I'm late.
I had a patient go into cardiac arrest...

102
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:58,323
...and saying "Sorry, I have a date"
might have come off as slightly insensitive.

103
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,161
Patient's fine now,
thanks for asking.

104
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,306
You told me you never met my father.

105
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:16,340
- Who took these photographs?
- A private investigator.

106
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,040
You had me followed?

107
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,118
No. I had my father followed.

108
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,847
Unless you both share
a passion for feeding pigeons...

109
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,150
...there must be a reason for your meeting.

110
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,883
How long have you been working for him?

111
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:33,029
Took me five dates to figure it out...
You're delusional.

112
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:37,192
A hundred thousand dollars wired into your
account from LuthorCorp. Is that a delusion?

113
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,464
- You checked my bank account?
- After I discovered you were having...

114
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,200
...tete-a-tete with my father,
I ran a background check.

115
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:47,142
I imagine those two weeks a year you spend
in Rwanda treating orphan children...

116
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,748
...does wonders for your conscience.

117
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,713
Who are you?

118
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,213
Someone who's been burned
by the opposite sex...

119
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,220
...more times than he cares to admit.

120
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,153
So tell me.

121
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,556
Why does a Harvard-educated physician...

122
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,821
...a woman of supposed integrity...

123
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:08,934
...accept a six-figure sum to spy on a man
she claims to have feelings for?

124
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,933
First of all...

125
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,868
...I don't recall claiming
anything of the sort.

126
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,941
And second of all,
if you think I'm gonna put up...

127
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,671
...with your pathetic, paranoid attempts
at invading my privacy...

128
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:24,112
...you're even more arrogant
than everyone said you were.

129
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:46,165
Unless the bathrobe passes for
haute couture these days...

130
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,603
...I'm guessing someone's
not ready for the party.

131
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,970
I don't know how this day
slipped by so fast.

132
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,543
I was over at Whitney's...

133
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,739
...Iooking at some old photos,
trying to refresh his memory.

134
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,911
How's he doing?

135
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,919
You know, surprisingly well,
considering everything he's been through.

136
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,957
Did he mention your
award-winning Dear John video?

137
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,061
He doesn't remember ever seeing it.

138
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,821
He thinks we're still a couple.

139
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,465
Well, that's got to be awkward.

140
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,298
I can't turn my back on him now.

141
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,169
He needs me more than ever.

142
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,434
Could Lana Lang be falling
for the man in uniform?

143
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,134
Why would you say that?

144
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:29,611
I don't know. I just sense that this
may not be just a Florence Nightingale...

145
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,377
...nursing a wounded soldier.

146
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:36,378
I don't know how to feel, you know?
It's happening so fast.

147
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,649
But seeing him again...

148
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:43,091
...a lot of those feelings came back,
feelings I thought were long gone.

149
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,531
Hence the 45-minute wardrobe crisis.

150
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:53,165
The thing with Whitney
is that what you see is what you get.

151
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,706
There are no mysteries.
No deep, dark secrets.

152
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,107
Unlike someone we know.

153
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,793
Catch any tape-delayed Sharks games?
They're burying the entire league.

154
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,263
I'm not that interested
in football these days.

155
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:25,461
If you're up for it, I'd love to set up an
exclusive interview with you for the Torch.

156
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,163
I actually don't remember that much...

157
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:31,640
...and what I do remember,
I'd rather not talk about.

158
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:36,075
Now that I'm back home, I'd rather
focus on the more important things in life.

159
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,278
Great.

160
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,583
Hey, Clark.

161
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,883
- Whitney, good to have you back.
- Hey, Fordman!

162
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,085
- Yeah.
- Hey, dude, how you been, man?

163
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,093
Listen, Clark, about Saturday.

164
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,994
No, it's okay. I understand.

165
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,728
What's going on this Saturday?

166
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,732
Nothing.

167
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,803
I take it you two saw a lot
of each other while I was gone?

168
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,407
No, not especially.

169
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,378
Clark and I are just friends, Whitney.

170
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,353
I'm gonna get some punch.

171
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,967
How could I have been so stupid?

172
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,949
Whitney, what's going on?

173
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,813
What's going on with you and Lana?

174
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,613
Nothing.

175
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,222
I kept my promise.
I looked out for her, that's it.

176
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,655
Oh, yeah, you're a real class act, Kent.

177
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,761
I go off and fight for my country
and you stab me in the back...

178
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,626
...by trying to steal my girl.
- That's not what happened.

179
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,399
How'd you do that to the door?

180
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:07,771
I'm a trained U.S. Marine, Clark.
There's a lot of things I can do.

181
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,101
Stay away from Lana.

182
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,888
Lana? We need to talk.

183
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,526
About what happened in the Talon?

184
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:31,255
- Could have apologized over the phone.
- What are you talking about?

185
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,025
Whitney said he walked in on you
wrecking the bathroom.

186
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,861
He said you were in a jealous rage.

187
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,003
No, he was the one
tearing up the bathroom.

188
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,332
He said you told him
to stay away from me.

189
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:44,135
What? I didn't say that. He's lying.

190
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,344
After everything he's been through,
now you're calling him a liar?

191
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,907
I can't believe you.

192
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:29,320
Ma'am, I'm Lieutenant McNulty,
United States Marine Corps. May I come in?

193
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,083
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

194
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,029
Are you here to see Whitney?

195
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,531
I beg your pardon?

196
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,932
Hey, what's up, lieutenant?

197
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,496
There must be some mistake.

198
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,539
Mistake? What do you mean?

199
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,542
Ma'am, according to my superiors,
your son is actually...

200
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,523
I haven't seen Heisman in so long.

201
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,360
You know what I miss the most?

202
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:18,603
Times like this when it's just the two of us.

203
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,836
Hey, you're wearing your necklace.

204
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,604
Whenever I pictured you in my mind,
you always had it on.

205
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,270
I haven't worn it since they sent it back.

206
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:32,145
I wanted to know that you were safe first.

207
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,013
Sent back?

208
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,880
Oh, I gave it to you
when you left for basic training.

209
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,992
They sent it back to your mom
when you were listed as missing.

210
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,888
Why can't I remember?

211
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:49,801
I know how hard this must be for you. But
isn't the important thing that you're alive?

212
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:53,097
You know, that you're back
with people that care about you?

213
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,103
Lana, I've been thinking.

214
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,674
Now that Nell's gone, maybe...

215
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,515
Maybe we should move in together.

216
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,853
Whitney, we...

217
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,512
We can't move in together.

218
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,151
This is about Clark, isn't it?

219
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:18,855
- I told you, Clark and I are just friends.
- He's got secrets, Lana.

220
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,464
- What kind of secrets?
- You should be careful.

221
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:22,896
He's not what he seems.

222
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,561
- How do you know?
- Can we just not talk about Clark?

223
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,636
Lana, I'm sorry. I didn't...

224
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,769
I didn't mean to freak you out with
that whole moving-in thing. I just...

225
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,745
I just want to be with you all the time.

226
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,214
It's okay.

227
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,823
Who knows what kind of inside information
she's given him about my company.

228
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,239
Lex, you've been dating Helen for a while.

229
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:04,206
Nothing you ever told me would lead me
to believe she's the espionage type.

230
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,180
I'm afraid one day you'll learn
the frustrating truth.

231
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,044
People are seldom whom they appear to be.

232
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,251
Did she give you any kind of explanation?

233
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,412
Didn't get that far. When she learned
that I had her investigated...

234
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,353
...she turned hostile and stormed out.

235
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,256
If I knew someone was investigating me,
I'd be a little ticked off too.

236
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,290
You want to know
the most pathetic part about it?

237
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:32,404
The first time I actually pictured a
future with a woman beyond two months.

238
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,302
Did you ask her to explain
her side of the story?

239
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,739
May not be what it looks like.

240
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,845
I wish I shared your eternal optimism, Clark.

241
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:45,748
I'm not sure how much
of an optimist I've been lately.

242
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:50,352
Now that the quarterback's returned, you're
back at your own one-yard line with Lana?

243
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,590
Be patient.

244
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,192
Most quarterbacks' careers
don't last that long.

245
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,164
It's not just that.

246
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,465
I mean, I'm worried about him.
Since he's been back, he's been acting...

247
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,628
...bizarre. Like he's someone else.

248
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,967
He might be suffering from
post-traumatic stress.

249
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,336
Some employees
went through it after the tornado.

250
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:14,503
I sent them to a specialist in Metropolis.
They're doing better.

251
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,877
- Maybe this specialist could help Whitney.
- It's worth a try.

252
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,848
If you want, I can get him
an appointment this week.

253
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,578
Yeah, thanks.

254
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,786
What happened to you?

255
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,050
Answer the question!

256
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:30,091
What is my favorite radio station?

257
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,729
I don't know.

258
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:35,994
When I get in the car with Lana,
that radio has to be on the right station.

259
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,965
What is it?

260
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41,839
It's the one that plays the loud rock.

261
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:47,139
I think that there's a sticker
on one of your old schoolbooks.

262
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,304
Please...

263
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,092
What do you want now, Kent?

264
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:11,469
Look, Whitney, I know
we've had our differences in the past...

265
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,367
...but before you left,
I thought we had an understanding.

266
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,303
- I'm worried about you.
- About what?

267
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,567
You've been through a lot.

268
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,803
Lex told me about this doctor
who deals with post-traumatic stress.

269
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,972
If you're trying to break me and Lana up,
it's not gonna work.

270
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,017
I know you've had a thing for her.
You always have.

271
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,654
It's one of Clark Kent's many secrets.

272
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,814
Whitney, this has nothing to do with Lana.
You need help.

273
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:36,120
What I need
is for you to stay out of my life.

274
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,453
Shut up!

275
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,523
Clark, what's going on?

276
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,101
I know this may sound crazy,
but Whitney may not be Whitney.

277
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,262
Are you getting existential on us,
or is this Wall of Weird material?

278
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:22,771
I think he's Tina Greer.

279
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,569
The mighty morphing power girl?

280
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,644
- What?
- The girl who was Lex, then Lana...

281
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:30,043
...and then locked up.
- I know who she is, but it's impossible.

282
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,081
Why? She was obsessed with Lana,
remember?

283
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:35,652
Maybe she escaped to see her.
Who better to impersonate than Whitney?

284
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,618
She couldn't pull a Martin Guerre.

285
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,121
- Why not?
- Because she's dead.

286
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,350
- What?
- She committed suicide last week.

287
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,757
I'm running a story on it on page two.

288
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,794
- What happened?
- The authorities said...

289
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:50,231
...she went into the art-therapy room at the
hospital, doused herself in paint thinner...

290
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:53,462
...and lit a match.
- Okay, now that's nasty.

291
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,231
I know. Tina wrote a note saying...

292
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:58,309
...she didn't know who she was anymore.
She couldn't take it.

293
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:02,311
Did they ID her dental records?

294
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,780
There's something else about Tina.

295
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:14,049
I think she may know about my abilities.

296
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,387
- You think?
- I had to use them to stop her.

297
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,395
Once she was declared insane,
I figured I didn't have to worry.

298
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,930
Well, you gotta worry now.

299
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,193
What about the meteor rocks?
Does she know?

300
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,894
Yeah, she used
Lana's necklace against me.

301
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,369
You better be careful, man.

302
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,440
I'm gonna go find Tina. You warn Lana.

303
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,542
Warn me about what?

304
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,909
Lana, this may be hard
for you to understand, but...

305
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,616
...we may think that
Whitney's actually Tina Greer.

306
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:42,352
Why would you say that?

307
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:46,214
- You just have to believe me.
- This is just insane.

308
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,529
I know it's a lot to process, but it's true.

309
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:55,264
I'm going to the Fordmans',
you stay here with Pete till I get back.

310
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,370
I need some time alone.

311
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,907
I understand, Lana,
but that freak is dangerous.

312
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,708
I know.

313
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,420
You're Tina.

314
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,541
Who you calling a freak?

315
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,774
Mrs. Fordman?

316
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,851
Mrs. Fordman?

317
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,861
Are you okay?

318
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,933
- Where's Whitney?
- I don't know.

319
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,733
Whoever it is, it is not my son.

320
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,437
That girl, she's some kind of monster.

321
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,238
Okay.

322
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,807
Lana, we have to talk.

323
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,008
Could you give me a second?
It's kind of...

324
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,518
It can't wait. Sit down.

325
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,515
Lana...

326
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,023
...will you marry me?

327
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:36,063
I understood why you didn't
want to move in together...

328
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:39,466
Now it'll be legal,
and we can elope and get out of Smallville.

329
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:43,233
Whitney, this is crazy.
You know I'm still in high school.

330
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:47,846
My mom was only 16 when
she married my dad. This is her ring.

331
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,018
I'm sorry.

332
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:55,244
I can't accept it.

333
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:57,150
Why not?

334
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,656
Whitney, that...

335
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:03,692
That video letter I sent you.

336
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,265
There were some things that I said...

337
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,458
...that I can't keep from you anymore.

338
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:11,193
Like what?

339
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,363
I said that I...

340
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,540
I told you I thought we should
go our separate ways.

341
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:23,876
I didn't want to say anything
when you said you couldn't remember.

342
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:28,213
You've been through so much,
and I didn't want to hurt you like that.

343
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,556
I will always...

344
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:33,055
...care about you, Whitney.

345
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:36,456
- But you care more about Clark.
- This has nothing to do with Clark.

346
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:39,393
Don't lie to me.

347
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:44,226
Look me in the eye and tell me
you don't have feelings for him.

348
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,069
I have to get back to work.

349
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,738
It's okay.

350
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:54,470
It's okay.

351
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:58,046
Thing that combat taught me is how to...

352
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,380
...deal with loss...

353
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,417
...and move on.

354
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,050
I'm sorry.

355
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:10,759
If I could just ask you for one thing.

356
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,061
Of course.

357
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,463
Your necklace...
Do you think I could have it? L...

358
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:22,238
It's just something to remember you by.
I know it means a lot to you.

359
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:25,874
It does.

360
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:32,509
That's why I want you to have it.

361
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,661
Hey, Dad.

362
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,529
Oh, hi, Clark.

363
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:53,171
Say, how's Mrs. Fordman doing?

364
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,569
They're gonna keep her overnight.

365
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:58,100
She's pretty freaked out
by this whole thing.

366
00:27:58,277 --> 00:27:59,972
Who could blame her, right?

367
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,649
Any idea where Tina is now?

368
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,284
No.

369
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,846
She could be anyone.

370
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,187
You're right about that.

371
00:28:22,602 --> 00:28:25,765
I always wondered
how you beat me, Clark.

372
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:29,700
You should be dead, but you're not.

373
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:32,740
The meteor shower must have
done something to you too.

374
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:36,739
Looks painful.

375
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,854
Tina, don't do this.

376
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:46,218
If I want to be with Lana...

377
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,417
...I don't have a choice.

378
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,697
Last year...

379
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:53,263
...you threatened to kill her.

380
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:57,061
Yeah. It was the worst mistake of my life.

381
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,364
She rejected me,
and I acted without thinking.

382
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,108
But I love her...

383
00:29:04,377 --> 00:29:07,608
...and I'll do anything to be with her.

384
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:11,914
And I finally figured out
who Lana wants to be with.

385
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,954
It's gonna be easy to become you, Clark.

386
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:18,647
No. Stay away from her.

387
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:20,689
You have the perfect life.

388
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:24,253
Great parents, good friends.

389
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:29,367
And most importantly, the girl of our dreams
waiting for you to finally make a move.

390
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:39,204
No!

391
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:51,253
I'm not used to people ignoring my calls.

392
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:56,190
- I have to get to work.
- Look, you can at least...

393
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,762
...offer me some kind of explanation.

394
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,728
Your father did approach me, Lex.

395
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,368
He did offer me money,
but not to spy on you.

396
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:04,901
Then what did he want?

397
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:06,834
He wanted me to dump you.

398
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:10,908
Even after I told him to go to hell,
he wired the money anyway.

399
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:14,245
So I guess he succeeded
in exactly what he set out to do.

400
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:15,971
Break us up.

401
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:19,879
You're telling me my father offered you
$ 100,000 against your will?

402
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:21,349
Why would he do that?

403
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,978
I can't even begin to fathom the depths
of the Luthor family pathology.

404
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,887
- You could have told me.
- I was about to...

405
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,360
...but before I could say a word, I realized
I was in the middle of an interrogation.

406
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:37,663
Helen.

407
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:40,534
- Lf I had known...
- No, no, no.

408
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,537
I'm glad that this happened.

409
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,506
It showed me
who I was really dealing with.

410
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:49,437
You know, I've done some
pretty stupid things in my life...

411
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:53,142
...but this could possibly win
the Nobel Prize for stupidity.

412
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:56,649
I fell for someone
who never really existed.

413
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,781
Hey.

414
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:36,046
Sorry. I hope you don't mind. I...

415
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,085
I need... I'm sock-deprived.

416
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:40,350
All my clothes are stuck on spin.

417
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:44,656
Well, go ahead.
I've gotta go to the Talon and close out.

418
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,697
I bumped into Whitney.
He told me what happened.

419
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,067
Is he okay?

420
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,840
Well, he said you're not
an easy girl to get over...

421
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,000
...but he knows you'll be happy with Clark.

422
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:01,806
I told him this has nothing to do with Clark.

423
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:05,246
Come on, Lana,
it's obvious you two belong together.

424
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:09,846
Okay, now you're starting to act strange.

425
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,020
- Why?
- Well, given your past history with Clark...

426
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:18,686
...I'm surprised you're so eager
to play matchmaker.

427
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:27,603
Don't think it's easy for me, Lana.

428
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:31,906
I just don't want to stand in the way
of what's meant to be.

429
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,878
Sorry.

430
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,318
Clark!

431
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:50,459
He's down here!

432
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:53,393
Clark! Son.

433
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:57,131
- Are you all right? What happened?
- The ship saved me.

434
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:58,565
How'd it do that?

435
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:01,467
I don't know,
but look what it did to the necklace.

436
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,606
Oh, my God.

437
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:06,404
I have to save Lana.

438
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:08,513
Wait, Clark.

439
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,866
- Hey.
- Sorry. Did I scare you?

440
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:36,437
No, I just... I wasn't expecting
to see anyone this late.

441
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:41,171
Lana, there's something I should tell you.

442
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:44,145
When I saw you with Whitney,
I realized that...

443
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:48,047
...if I didn't act on my true feelings,
I could lose you forever.

444
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:51,353
Did someone put something
in the water supply?

445
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:54,014
Because everyone's
acting really strange today.

446
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:57,492
I'm acting the way I should have
acted the first time I met you.

447
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:01,430
Lana, I love you.

448
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:14,937
Clark.

449
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,059
- Get away from her!
- What's going on?

450
00:35:37,226 --> 00:35:39,353
I'll explain everything when
I get you away from Tina.

451
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,060
- Tina?
- No, Lana. That's Tina.

452
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:45,895
- Lana, it's me, Clark.
- Don't listen to him. He's lying.

453
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:48,730
The guy who fixed the leaky drain pipe.

454
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:54,805
- No, we're supposed to be together.
- Stay away from me, you freak!

455
00:35:54,977 --> 00:35:56,444
No!

456
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,274
You ruined everything!

457
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,189
I'm gonna kick your ass, Kent.

458
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:18,633
Bring it on.

459
00:36:54,804 --> 00:36:58,001
Tina! Listen to me.

460
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,005
You don't have to do this.
You can stop.

461
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,871
I can help you.

462
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:08,249
Why don't you just die?

463
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,387
Tina.

464
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:29,529
Take care of Lana.

465
00:37:47,924 --> 00:37:50,358
How's Mrs. Fordman?

466
00:37:53,663 --> 00:37:56,325
The military officer that Tina murdered...

467
00:37:56,499 --> 00:38:00,492
...was coming to tell Mrs. Fordman
that they had found Whitney's body.

468
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:05,496
- Whitney died in combat.
- Oh, my God!

469
00:38:05,675 --> 00:38:08,940
- Oh, that's horrible.
- Yeah.

470
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:13,310
Clark?

471
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:16,847
Have you seen Lana?

472
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,013
Chloe said she's not ready
to see anyone yet.

473
00:38:20,189 --> 00:38:22,419
Sweetheart, are you all right?

474
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:25,757
I just can't help thinking that...

475
00:38:26,395 --> 00:38:29,296
...Whitney's skin wasn't bulletproof.

476
00:38:29,465 --> 00:38:32,798
His bones weren't unbreakable,
but he still put himself in harm's way...

477
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:34,937
...so the world could be safer.

478
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:39,831
I wonder if I didn't have my abilities,
if I'd have the same kind of courage.

479
00:38:49,051 --> 00:38:51,144
Son, there is no doubt...

480
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,584
...in our minds...

481
00:38:53,756 --> 00:38:55,519
...that you would.

482
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:23,914
Lex.

483
00:39:24,353 --> 00:39:26,150
What I did was inexcusable.

484
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:29,956
I violated your privacy.
I should have trusted you.

485
00:39:30,126 --> 00:39:32,253
It's a little late for apologies.

486
00:39:32,428 --> 00:39:33,895
From the time I was born...

487
00:39:34,063 --> 00:39:37,226
...I was raised in an environment
of suspicion and distrust.

488
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,331
My father taught me to regard everyone
as an adversary, no matter who they are.

489
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,995
I'm sorry you had to grow up like that,
I am, but...

490
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,266
When my mother died...

491
00:39:46,442 --> 00:39:49,411
...I began to build a wall around my heart.

492
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:53,547
Every year that wall grew
taller and more fortified...

493
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:56,583
...till eventually it became impenetrable.

494
00:39:57,453 --> 00:40:00,718
I want to tear the wall down,
Helen, I do. I just...

495
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,415
I don't have the slightest clue
how to do it.

496
00:40:09,665 --> 00:40:11,292
Lex...

497
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:16,101
I've never once asked anyone for help,
but I'm asking you now.

498
00:40:16,906 --> 00:40:19,170
Help me, Helen.

499
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,743
I don't want to become my father.

500
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:15,656
I called your house.

501
00:41:15,831 --> 00:41:18,265
Your mom said you were down here.

502
00:41:19,335 --> 00:41:20,859
I am so sorry.

503
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:24,869
I never should have sent that video.

504
00:41:26,475 --> 00:41:28,033
Don't do that to yourself.

505
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:30,676
He was missing in action...

506
00:41:30,846 --> 00:41:33,974
...fighting for his life,
thinking that I wasn't there...

507
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,981
...that I didn't care.

508
00:41:36,152 --> 00:41:37,676
It's not your fault.

509
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,890
Seems like...

510
00:41:43,058 --> 00:41:47,791
...every person that I've ever
gotten close to just leaves.

511
00:41:48,931 --> 00:41:52,389
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

512
00:41:53,536 --> 00:41:56,130
My parents, Nell...

513
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,772
...now Whitney.

514
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:07,070
I know I haven't been a good friend.

515
00:42:09,218 --> 00:42:12,881
- You've been a great friend.
- No, I have doubted you...

516
00:42:13,055 --> 00:42:17,219
...accused you of things,
and still you're here, protecting me.

517
00:42:21,363 --> 00:42:23,729
I don't care if you have secrets, Clark.

518
00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:30,030
You are the one good, constant thing
in my life, and I don't want to lose you too.

519
00:42:34,276 --> 00:42:36,710
I'm not going anywhere.

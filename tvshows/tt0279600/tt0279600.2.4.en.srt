1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:04,536
Nothing says school spirit like a ring
that looks like it was jacked from P. Diddy.

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:07,037
- I think it looks great.
- I think we'll be lucky...

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,972
...if the glue holds through graduation.

4
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,645
I wonder if the ruby's even real.

5
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:17,017
You sure you're gonna do this?

6
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,879
I'm here, aren't I?

7
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:24,615
- What?
- I believe your dad's exact words were:

8
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:28,785
"Three hundred and fifty dollars is a lot to
spend on something you really don't need."

9
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:32,091
I earned that money. Besides,
Dad said it was my decision to make.

10
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:35,292
Which means that you're really not
supposed to buy it.

11
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:42,241
I know the first day at a new school can be
rough, so if you have questions, just ask.

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,571
So, what do you Crows do for fun?

13
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,373
Between the tractor-pulls
and the hoedowns.

14
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,846
- There's the Talon.
- Which is...?

15
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:52,645
A coffeehouse,
and a really cool place to hang out.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,780
But I'm kind of biased,
because I sort of own it.

17
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:00,222
Gee, I'll have to check it out.

18
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:05,462
Whoa. Who is the major hottie
in primary colors?

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,595
That's Clark Kent.

20
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,629
No offense, Lana, but maybe
I could get him to show me around.

21
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,559
You feeling all right?

22
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,498
Yeah, I feel great.

23
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,329
Excuse me.

24
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,471
It's Jessie, isn't it?

25
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:49,098
Perhaps Ms. Lang didn't tell you, but
there's a dress code here at Smallville High.

26
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,573
Lame and lamer?

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,475
You think that's funny, Mr. Kent?

28
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,449
By the way, I'm not changing.

29
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,712
Well, perhaps you'd like
to discuss your attitude in my office.

30
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,391
Excuse me, Mr. Gibbons?

31
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:13,195
I think she looks really hot,
and I think that your dress code sucks.

32
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,425
Excuse me?

33
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:18,595
I mean, come on.
It's her first day, cut her some slack.

34
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,935
Besides, I don't think you
should be the one giving fashion tips.

35
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,980
Tomorrow, young lady,
proper attire or you're going straight home.

36
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,247
I guess we can finish our tour.

37
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:43,125
Where did that come from?

38
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,694
I don't know...

39
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,269
...but I think I liked it.

40
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,175
I'm telling you, man,
I don't know where she is.

41
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:03,006
Look, Kyle...

42
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,825
What kind of U.S. Marshal are you,
anyways?

43
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,525
The kind that gets results.

44
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,734
- Okay.
- Okay? Okay, what?

45
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,665
I've heard from her once or twice.

46
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,964
She called me collect
from someplace in Kansas.

47
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,434
Where in Kansas? It's a big state.

48
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,669
All over. They were from pay phones.

49
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:35,008
Check my phone bill. That's all I know.

50
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,150
You have to believe me.

51
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,946
Relax.

52
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,517
I believe you.

53
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,523
So you'll let me go now?

54
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:49,390
Oh, I would, but Jessie might call.

55
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,555
And you might decide to warn her.

56
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:03,198
So this is what I was talking about.

57
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:05,839
It's right over the county line,
and they don't check IDs.

58
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:07,167
Dude, this is like a bar.

59
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:10,936
I know. You're the one who says if you
wanna have fun, you gotta take risks.

60
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,305
We can go this weekend.

61
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,074
The day Clark Kent decides to break rules,
I'll be there.

62
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:16,841
- All right.
- Clark, right?

63
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:20,954
Jessie Brooks. That place rocks.
I checked it out on my way into town.

64
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:24,250
- Are you planning a road trip?
- Lf we do, I'll let you know.

65
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:35,361
You'll need to know
how to get in touch with me.

66
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:45,044
In case you require a translation,
that was her hitting on you.

67
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,201
She is kind of hot.

68
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,240
Aren't you married to Lana
in your imagination?

69
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,844
Clark! You and Jessie
seem to be making fast friends.

70
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,785
Just trying to make
the new girl feel welcome.

71
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:01,589
Don't worry, Lana,
I haven't taken my eye off you all day.

72
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:07,263
So we still on for that cram session
tonight at the Talon?

73
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:10,103
If you're still gonna be there, absolutely.

74
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:11,866
I'll be there.

75
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:24,076
So soon as you get this shined
to your liking, I get the first ride.

76
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,186
Yep, and all the others
can just take a number.

77
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:30,146
Hey, where's Clark? He's really late.

78
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,490
Looking for me?

79
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:37,927
Yeah. Weren't you supposed to be here
with me, working on the garage door?

80
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:40,158
Dad, that'll take, like, two seconds.

81
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:46,470
And I thought we agreed
you weren't gonna buy that ring.

82
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:50,100
I thought we decided
it was my decision to make.

83
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,410
That's because I assumed
that you would make the right one.

84
00:06:56,217 --> 00:06:57,980
Clark, that ring costs a lot of money.

85
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,745
And I'm tired of worrying
about every nickel and dime.

86
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,253
Clark, why don't you go wash up for dinner.

87
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:06,518
I'm not hungry.
Besides, I have chores to do.

88
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,854
What was that all about?

89
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:15,195
I think our not-so-normal son might be going
through some classic teenage rebellion.

90
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,668
Well, I think I liked dealing
with heat vision a lot better than that.

91
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:22,501
- Martha, that was a bad decision he made.
- But it was his to make.

92
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,407
I seem to recall a certain young man
who defied his father...

93
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,674
...and spent $500 on an old motorcycle.

94
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:34,715
Challenging him is only gonna
make it worse.

95
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:51,869
When I got up this morning,
I was pretty sure this was my office.

96
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,032
Lex! I thought you wouldn't mind
if I had a few changes made...

97
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,201
...since I'm gonna be here a while.
Go on.

98
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,870
What I mind is not being consulted.

99
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:10,885
I didn't realize I'd need
my son's permission to try to make my...

100
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:13,492
...situation here a trifle more bearable.

101
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:18,491
I've lost my sight.
Allow me at least a modicum of dignity.

102
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:22,368
Give him whatever he wants.

103
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:39,014
- Barkeep, I'm looking for a girl.
- Aren't we all?

104
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,617
The girl in this photo
used that phone over there.

105
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,889
Any crime in that?

106
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:47,152
No, but she is a teenager...

107
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:51,287
...and we both know the
legal drinking age in Kansas is 21.

108
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,197
If she comes back in, you call me.

109
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,531
The number's on the back.

110
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:12,116
I think we should start in the middle...

111
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:19,350
Hey, Clark, glad you made it. We're just
doing American history, the Red Scare.

112
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:22,586
Hey, can we do that tomorrow?

113
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,822
- Why, is something wrong?
- No, it...

114
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:28,332
It's really nice out tonight.
Let's go for a drive, go dancing.

115
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,566
Are you asking me on a date?

116
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,673
I'm asking you to have some fun with me.

117
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:41,137
This is a little unexpected,
to say the least.

118
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,173
But we really have to study.

119
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,717
Did you know when you get all serious,
your nose crinkles up?

120
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:49,486
It's really sexy.

121
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:54,153
Pete and Chloe are waiting for us.

122
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:09,340
- Well, let me use your sheet.
- Yeah. Maybe we should check...

123
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:13,008
What did you get for number five?

124
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:16,312
Hey, man.

125
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,110
Where are your books?

126
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:20,253
You guys want to go to a bar?

127
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:25,390
You can commit academic hara-kiri,
but the rest of us need to cram for this test.

128
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,153
You guys, high school's supposed to be fun.

129
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:30,263
This is not fun.

130
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,865
- Come on, my treat.
- When did you and the money truck hook up?

131
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:37,162
Since I decided there's no percentage
in playing poverty.

132
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,804
I'm gonna get a refill.
I'm gonna get you some decaf.

133
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,702
Here, I'll give you a hand.

134
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,571
Yeah, I have never...

135
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:53,246
Did you know that Chloe
had a birthmark on her cheek?

136
00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:56,082
- No, she doesn't.
- Not that cheek.

137
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,356
Are you doing what I think you're doing?

138
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:08,629
- Clark, that's Chloe you're scoping, man.
- Not just Chloe.

139
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:17,671
- Come on, let's go have some fun.
- Clark, this test is half our grade.

140
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:21,677
If you want to party this weekend, I'm
with you, but right now, I need to do this.

141
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:26,548
All right. Well, when you're through with
Boring 101, give me a call.

142
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,691
You're kidding.

143
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,860
Thank you.

144
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,228
What's wrong?

145
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:44,837
That was the credit card company.
They were...

146
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:49,203
...calling to verify some charges that
were made on our card? Last night?

147
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,813
When did we get a satellite dish?

148
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:12,558
This is silk!

149
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:44,355
- Clark!
- Clark! Where did you get all this?

150
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,864
Discount Eddie's in Metropolis.
Open all night!

151
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,831
You mean to tell...

152
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:55,338
You mean you took
our credit cards and you bought all this...?

153
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,374
- You bought all this junk?
- Yeah.

154
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:00,445
I figured it was time I had
the cool stuff everyone else has.

155
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,377
Clark Kent, you stole from us.

156
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,540
No. I used your credit cards.

157
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,080
What's the big deal?
We don't have to pay for it right away.

158
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,485
Well, I'll tell you the big deal...

159
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,561
...the big deal is, you're gonna take all this
garbage back right now. Come on!

160
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,129
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, right.

161
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,993
After you've taken this garbage back...

162
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,864
...we're gonna have a conversation
about this new attitude you've developed.

163
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:27,063
Well, Dad, you can talk all you want.
I'm out of here.

164
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,312
Clark! Clark, come back here!

165
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,433
You're not going to school
dressed like that.

166
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,236
Okay. Then I just won't go.

167
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,379
Jessie, please, you're a smart girl.

168
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:09,675
You know we can't afford
to draw attention to ourselves.

169
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,756
Need a ride?

170
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,791
Clark?

171
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,828
Jessie.

172
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:32,069
- My hero.
- Jessie, I need you to...

173
00:14:56,263 --> 00:15:01,667
Okay, what planet is that guy from
and what did he do with Clark?

174
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,373
Well, Clark...

175
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:11,443
...thanks for the ride.

176
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:13,102
Anytime.

177
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,985
So much for the shy and retiring Clark Kent.

178
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,713
I was just giving her a ride to school.

179
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,858
Say the word and
I'll save you the return trip.

180
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,089
Catch up with you later.

181
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,031
Clark Kent, chick magnet.
What's wrong with this picture?

182
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,035
People change, Pete.

183
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:43,809
- Clark, I'd like a word with you, please.
- Not right now, Dad.

184
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:50,510
- Get in the truck, son.
- Give me one good reason why I should.

185
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:54,450
Because I am your father,
and I just told you to get in the truck.

186
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,418
You're not my father.

187
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,482
You never were.

188
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:11,537
You all right, sir?

189
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,743
Here you go.

190
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:30,247
- I can't believe Clark would do that.
- It's like he's a whole different person.

191
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:33,791
- How are we gonna get him home?
- I don't know.

192
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:37,962
Fact is, if he doesn't want to come home,
there isn't much either one of us can do.

193
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:41,191
Here, I'll take it. I'll get that.

194
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,935
Takes your whole teenage-rebellion
theory to a new level.

195
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,903
This is more than teenage rebellion.

196
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,937
A change this drastic
doesn't happen overnight.

197
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,237
Martha, it's Clark.

198
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,575
All of his other abilities
cropped up overnight.

199
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,843
Do you think this is part
of his development?

200
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,988
I don't know.
But from what he said...

201
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:05,556
...I guess those feelings have been
boiling up for a while.

202
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:08,092
No, Jonathan, Clark loves you.

203
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,661
But there's something
seriously wrong with him.

204
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:15,159
I don't think another father-and-son talk
is gonna help this time.

205
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:18,437
Maybe Pete can help.

206
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,300
They're always together.

207
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:23,773
We should find out if he has
any idea what's causing Clark's behavior.

208
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:25,969
Well, we've gotta do something.

209
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,753
Lana, we need to talk.

210
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,754
Clark, please, I really need
to get these orders done.

211
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,258
Your coffee can wait.

212
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:46,028
I got the impression that you were
jealous when you saw me with Jessie.

213
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:51,198
Don't be ridiculous.
You can spend time with anyone you want.

214
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,468
Don't get me wrong.
I was happy you were jealous.

215
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,703
Clark, what is going on with you?

216
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,575
I've decided to tell you the truth, Lana.

217
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,116
About...?

218
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:07,253
- About everything?
- Try me.

219
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,217
What do you want to know?

220
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:13,385
For starters, how about what
happened the day the twisters hit?

221
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,625
We'll get there.

222
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,128
But right now we should concentrate
on more important things, like...

223
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,404
I've had feelings for you for a long time...

224
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:29,342
...and I know that
you've had feelings for me too.

225
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:33,340
So I think we should stop pretending.

226
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:38,443
So, what?
Is this supposed to be some...

227
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:42,486
...all-new Clark Kent?
- Well, that depends.

228
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,655
Do you like him?

229
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:07,370
Clark, l...

230
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,640
What about Jessie?

231
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:11,942
Jessie who?

232
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,187
You're the one I want to be with.

233
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:20,549
I'll pick you up at 8.

234
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:37,741
Pete, you are not gonna believe
what I found out.

235
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:40,846
Our "el cheapo" class rings are,
in fact, fake.

236
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,539
Chloe, there's something wrong with Clark.

237
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:46,919
More than usual?

238
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:49,851
Last night at the Talon,
the motorcycle...

239
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,116
...other stuff.
- What kind of other stuff?

240
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,693
The kind that has
Mr. And Mrs. Kent calling my house.

241
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,456
They're worried.
It's, like, they think he's on drugs.

242
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,131
Clark would have to be on drugs
to be on drugs.

243
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:03,934
Just be careful with that.

244
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:06,334
- What is it, anyway?
- My expose.

245
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:11,239
See this lovely $350 piece of
school spirit? It's a rip-off.

246
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:15,142
The jewelry company was substituting
worthless meteor rocks for rubies...

247
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,408
...to save money.
- Chloe...

248
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,415
...rings, red. Meteor rocks, green.

249
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:22,680
Not the load they found near
Hobbs Pond. Note the red vein.

250
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,821
You can read all about it
on page one of today's Torch.

251
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,164
Pete.

252
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:38,561
Chloe's gonna force a recall
because the rings are made from this.

253
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:42,139
- Think that's what's causing his behavior?
- Well, that's when it started.

254
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,901
Right after he slipped on the ring.

255
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,568
If the green meteor rocks
affect Clark physically...

256
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,737
...maybe the red affects him emotionally.

257
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,678
That explains his personality changes.

258
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,478
The longer he's exposed to the green,
the worse he gets.

259
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,746
If the same is true with the red,
God help us.

260
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:59,221
- We're gonna find him, get that ring back.
- How are we gonna do that?

261
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:02,452
Like you said, if he doesn't
wanna do something, we can't force it.

262
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,860
Sweetheart, I don't know,
but we have to figure out a way.

263
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:19,210
I came to shoot some pool, but it looks like
this establishment's been closed.

264
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:23,873
My father's presence
has required certain sacrifices.

265
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,209
- Why don't you throw him out?
- Clark...

266
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:29,651
...it's not like the thought
hasn't occurred to me, but...

267
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,423
...his blindness changes the situation.

268
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:39,497
Just because your father has a problem
doesn't mean he needs to ruin your life.

269
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,197
I wasn't aware a $2000 coat
came with a backbone.

270
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:46,236
What's going on?

271
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:49,874
I'd like to borrow the Ferrari.
Got a hot date tonight, and I wanna...

272
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:52,011
...rock her world.

273
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,774
"Rock her world"?

274
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,008
So, Lana at last.

275
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,778
Like you said, a man needs
to know when to make his move.

276
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:03,514
I'm glad you're finally
acting on your feelings, but...

277
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,659
...Lana's never struck me as a girl
to be impressed by a Ferrari.

278
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,726
Fast cars...

279
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:11,693
...fancy home and a ton of money
never hurt you, did it?

280
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,626
Come on, I just
want to make tonight special.

281
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:19,431
I don't know. It's a very expensive
piece of machinery, difficult to handle.

282
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:21,540
It's not like I'm going to...

283
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,972
...drive it off a bridge.

284
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:28,273
All you have to ask yourself is...

285
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:31,582
...who's more responsible than Clark Kent?

286
00:22:57,811 --> 00:22:59,403
This place is great!

287
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:03,071
I guess. Not exactly what I was expecting.

288
00:23:06,086 --> 00:23:08,111
What are you looking at?

289
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,085
Clark, I'm fine.

290
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,780
I'm fine.

291
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,254
- Want a beer?
- What?

292
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,558
- Do you want a beer?
- No! And since when do you drink?

293
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,496
If you don't wanna drink, let's dance.

294
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:25,900
Clark, this place isn't us.
Let's go somewhere else and talk.

295
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,802
I'll take that dance, Clark.

296
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:34,513
- Whoa!
- I took your advice, Lana...

297
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:36,546
...and checked out the Talon.
- Yeah?

298
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:39,116
Yeah, that's why I decided to come here.

299
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,649
- Clark, come on. Let's go.
- One dance.

300
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,657
Lana, I'll be right back.

301
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,743
- So do you like living in Smallville?
- It's the only place I ever lived.

302
00:24:12,352 --> 00:24:16,584
Well, there's a big, bad world out there.
The right person ought to show you.

303
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,690
Anyone in mind?

304
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:24,962
I'm leaving.

305
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:26,992
Lana, we just got here.

306
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:30,895
Why don't you go get us some drinks.
We'll all have a good time.

307
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,597
You're unbelievable!
What happened to telling the truth?

308
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:37,038
What happened to
"Spend time with whoever you want"?

309
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,577
- Is that the way you want it?
- Sure. There's enough of me to go around.

310
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:44,809
- Lana...
- Is there a problem here?

311
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:49,582
Not anymore.

312
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,215
I'd let the lady go if I were you.

313
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:07,731
- You're going down, smart guy.
- I don't think so.

314
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:19,775
Oh, God!

315
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,716
- Oh, God!
- Help him!

316
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:27,221
Anybody else?

317
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,701
I can't be here when the cops get here.

318
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:41,363
Yeah, let's go pack our bags, see that
big, bad world you were talking about.

319
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,703
Let it go, man! Let it go!

320
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,512
Where were you all night?
We looked everywhere.

321
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,583
Last night was the best night of my life.

322
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:55,152
- We want to help you.
- Help me?

323
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:57,846
Help me what? Stay here on the farm?

324
00:25:58,024 --> 00:26:01,187
Doing chores, wasting my life
for a $20-a-week allowance?

325
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:05,562
Clark, I wish you could hear yourself for
just a minute. There's something very...

326
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:08,292
...very wrong with you. It's that ring.

327
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:12,603
You're still upset about me
buying this stupid thing.

328
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:14,637
How pathetic.

329
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,035
Clark.

330
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,404
You really don't want to touch me.

331
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,047
Why don't you just hand it to me, then.

332
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:28,018
Clark, please, it isn't the ring itself. Chloe
found out it's made out of red meteor rock.

333
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:30,312
You know how the green rock
makes you sick?

334
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,890
Well, we think the red rock
is affecting your mind.

335
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,254
It's changed your personality, Clark.

336
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:39,262
So everything I've been doing and saying
is because of this?

337
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:42,731
That's right. That's why you gotta
take that thing off right away.

338
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,598
Take it off?
I just wish I would have found it sooner.

339
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,206
If you guys wanna
waste your life in this mudhole...

340
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:51,241
...that's your problem.
I'm through being poor.

341
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:54,406
We might not have
all the things that other people have.

342
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,573
- I didn't think our family was about that.
- With my abilities, I can make millions.

343
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:01,242
Sports, TV, it's all waiting for me.

344
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:03,719
You're the ones who
force me to hide who I am.

345
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,916
No. We are the ones
who have been trying to protect you.

346
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,993
We don't want anybody taking you away.

347
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:11,722
Protecting me? Using me.

348
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:14,929
I'm just another piece of equipment
to keep your farm going.

349
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:16,534
That's all gonna change.

350
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:31,416
Lex, if it's all right, I'm gonna
keep the Ferrari a bit longer.

351
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:36,385
- I'll send it back when I get myself set up.
- Whoa, slow down. Clark, what's going on?

352
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,760
I left home.

353
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:47,430
What happened?
You have a fight with your folks?

354
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,693
My parents don't understand me.

355
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,634
The truth is, there's nothing left
for me in Smallville.

356
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:55,936
What about Lana?

357
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,807
She's old news.
I got a new girl, Jessie.

358
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,504
Kind of sudden, isn't it?

359
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,082
You're the one always telling me
to find my destiny.

360
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:08,516
Well, one thing's for certain,
it's not here in Kansas.

361
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,815
So you've just packed
your stuff and you're off.

362
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:16,928
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

363
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:20,222
Really?

364
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,258
Why don't you fill me in.

365
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:29,869
Let's just say that when I'm through
showing the world what I can do...

366
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:34,035
...I'll have everything I've ever wanted.
I may be even richer than you.

367
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:37,108
Maybe you're right
to get away from your folks.

368
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:39,274
Maybe I should do the same.

369
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:42,649
If my father wants the mansion so much...

370
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,550
...he can have it.

371
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:47,818
- I never wanted to live in Smallville.
- You can come with me.

372
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:50,360
Nobody's using
the penthouse in Metropolis.

373
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,430
Clark Kent and Lex Luthor.

374
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,827
I like the sound of that.

375
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:57,834
Let me just tie up
some loose ends at the office.

376
00:28:58,004 --> 00:29:00,564
Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.

377
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:13,877
- Hey.
- Hey.

378
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,557
So I heard from a source that you had
a big date with Clark last night.

379
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:23,087
Wouldn't call it a date when the guy
you went with leaves with someone else.

380
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:27,459
Wow. You just went
from the gossip column to page one.

381
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:31,764
Sorry, sometimes my
"glib-o-meter" goes into overdrive.

382
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:35,601
No. I guess...
You know, he's so secretive.

383
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:38,073
I guess I was thrown for a loop...

384
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:42,112
...by a Clark who could say all the things
that the old Clark couldn't.

385
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:45,577
Well, welcome to the conundrum
that is Clark Kent.

386
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:49,414
Part knight in shining armor,
part "Where did that come from?"

387
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:51,079
Miss?

388
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:54,055
- Can I get a refill here?
- Yeah. Yeah, just a second.

389
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:55,660
Thanks.

390
00:29:58,231 --> 00:30:00,199
Here you go.

391
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,161
Louise.

392
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:07,028
Did you get an owner and an address
on the license plate I asked you to run?

393
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:12,735
Of course I know who he is.

394
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:15,244
Thanks. You're an angel.

395
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,877
Are you sure this is the right thing to do?

396
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:24,955
Pete, Clark would not listen to reason.
We don't have much of a choice here.

397
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,084
There's only one way
to stop the unstoppable.

398
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:29,660
- Yeah...
- Excuse me.

399
00:30:30,363 --> 00:30:31,591
Mr. Kent.

400
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:34,631
Pete, why don't you...
Why don't you get going.

401
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,570
Lex, this is really not a very good time.

402
00:30:39,739 --> 00:30:42,264
I understand you and Clark
have been having problems.

403
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:46,775
I don't want to be rude, but I'd prefer it
if you'd stay out of my family's problems.

404
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:49,574
Believe me, Mr. Kent,
I'm not trying to pry, but...

405
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:50,977
...Clark's my friend.

406
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,243
I'd hate to see your relationship fall apart.

407
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:55,751
I appreciate your concern...

408
00:30:55,922 --> 00:30:58,254
...but Clark and I can work this out.

409
00:30:58,491 --> 00:31:01,358
Then why is Clark hiding out
at the mansion?

410
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:17,800
Lex?

411
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:21,410
Is that you?

412
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:24,073
Hey!

413
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:26,517
Whoa, hey!

414
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:28,252
What do you want?

415
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,488
Lionel, go back to your room.

416
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:33,454
Better yet, pack your bags
and get the hell out.

417
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:35,594
I beg your pardon?

418
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:38,588
Lex may be too afraid to tell you,
but I'm not.

419
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:40,527
No one in Smallville wants you here.

420
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,966
You seem to know a lot about me.
You got a name?

421
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:48,868
- Clark Kent.
- Jonathan and Martha Kent's son?

422
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:53,501
As far as I know, they're good people.
I'm astonished they've raised...

423
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,409
...such a blatantly aggressive offspring.

424
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,073
If you like them so much,
I'm sure they'll put you up.

425
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:03,483
I hear they have a spare bedroom,
and I know they could use the cash.

426
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:07,352
You've got a lot to learn about tact,
young man, but you speak your mind.

427
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,494
That's good. It'll take you far.

428
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:11,425
I'm going to the top.

429
00:32:12,632 --> 00:32:14,031
- Mr. Luthor?
- Yes.

430
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,068
I apologize for the interruption.
I'm a federal marshal. Your people let me in.

431
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,532
What can I do for you?

432
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:23,698
This man was seen last night leaving the
scene of a disturbance in your son's Ferrari.

433
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:27,744
Was that while you were
on your way to the top, Clark?

434
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:30,006
Where can I find this girl?

435
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:33,241
I've never seen her before.

436
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,054
Is that supposed to scare me?

437
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,197
How'd you do that?

438
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:51,560
You've got no idea
who you're dealing with.

439
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:55,232
What's happening?

440
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:01,379
- Who's shooting?
- Don't worry, Lionel...

441
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,310
...he missed.

442
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:07,642
I'll call security.

443
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,215
Why are you looking for Jessie?

444
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:16,919
It's not her, it's her father. They were
witness protection. They rabbited.

445
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:18,859
- Why?
- He's a corporate whistle-blower.

446
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:22,489
His former employer offered me
a million dollars if I could get evidence.

447
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,260
What kind of evidence?

448
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:28,965
Computer disks, accounting files,
memos, endless smoking guns.

449
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:32,508
Look, we can split it.
It's enough money to start a whole new life.

450
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,737
That's a great idea...

451
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:36,945
...but who needs you?

452
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:49,289
Thought you forgot about me.
Ready to go?

453
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:51,123
Almost.

454
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:54,391
I know about your father,
Jessie, and the disks.

455
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:57,092
We're not going
anywhere until I have them.

456
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,707
I don't understand. Why are you doing this?

457
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,314
The money.

458
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:12,542
You said you wanted to leave this town...

459
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:16,347
...and a million dollars is more than
enough money to make a fresh start.

460
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,524
If I give you those disks,
my dad is a dead man.

461
00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:22,058
He was dead when he started running.

462
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:25,061
- Didn't I tell you I didn't want to split?
- You need me, kid.

463
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:29,327
I know the players, how to get the money.
Now give him the disks, Jessica!

464
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:52,383
I don't want to hurt you, son.
But I will. Get out.

465
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,651
Just like my dad...

466
00:34:54,827 --> 00:34:57,227
...always telling me what to do.

467
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:00,223
I don't listen to him.

468
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:02,890
What makes you think
I'm gonna listen to you?

469
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:09,063
Where are the disks?

470
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:13,843
In the floorboards? In the ceiling?

471
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:15,807
In here?

472
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,750
Doesn't really matter.
I'll figure it out one way or another.

473
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,899
So why don't you save yourself
a lot of pain...

474
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:35,556
...and make it sooner.

475
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:39,898
You can kill me, you can tear this house
to the ground, you won't find those disks.

476
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,968
Jessie.

477
00:36:00,593 --> 00:36:02,754
Please don't do this.

478
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:09,265
I never realized how easy it would be
to get everything I've ever wanted.

479
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,492
Clark!

480
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,160
Pete?

481
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:17,742
- It take the whole study group to find me?
- No. Lionel Luthor heard you mention Jessie.

482
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,468
Jessie, run!

483
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:25,112
How far is she gonna get, Pete?
A mile or two?

484
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:27,912
You know no one can get away from me.

485
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:29,986
Clark!

486
00:36:34,093 --> 00:36:37,824
- I won't let you hurt anybody else.
- Still trying to tell me what to do.

487
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:42,056
Are you scared?

488
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,133
Then again,
you and Mom were always afraid of me.

489
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:49,468
No. We've had nothing but love for you.

490
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,605
That makes what I'm about to do
all that more difficult.

491
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:54,576
Pete.

492
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:56,271
Do it.

493
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:01,549
Pete.

494
00:37:01,754 --> 00:37:03,517
Clark, I'm sorry.

495
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,782
Clark!

496
00:37:29,782 --> 00:37:31,374
Dad?

497
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:35,343
It's okay, son. It's all right.

498
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,113
You okay, man?

499
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,323
Thanks, Pete.

500
00:37:41,193 --> 00:37:42,888
Who is that?

501
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,295
What's...? What's going on?

502
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,492
Lex?

503
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:51,669
What's going on in here?

504
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:56,570
What...? I didn't order
any more work to be done.

505
00:37:57,443 --> 00:38:00,742
- I'm putting the office back the way it was.
- You...

506
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:03,281
Have a drink, Dad.

507
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:13,248
Bas Armagnac, 1963?

508
00:38:17,196 --> 00:38:18,788
It's my favorite.

509
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:23,060
There was a time when I thought our taste
in brandy was all we had in common.

510
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:24,259
And now?

511
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:27,269
I've been thinking about the months
after the meteor shower...

512
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:28,872
...the way people looked at me.

513
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:31,271
A baldheaded boy, thinking I was a freak.

514
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:34,469
Please, Lex, not another tale of your
tortured youth and how I...

515
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,409
How I failed you as a father...

516
00:38:36,582 --> 00:38:38,880
Actually, you gave me
some excellent advice.

517
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:42,020
You told me to stop feeling sorry for myself.

518
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:46,521
These were the cards fate had dealt me.
It was best that I accept it and move on.

519
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:55,092
Stop acting like your blindness
gives you an excuse for self-pity.

520
00:38:58,037 --> 00:39:00,062
So the son becomes the father.

521
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,831
No, Dad.

522
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:05,076
I'm through indulging you like a child.

523
00:39:05,244 --> 00:39:09,704
My office remains my office.
You don't like it, leave.

524
00:39:09,882 --> 00:39:15,650
Well. Seems I have done a better job
of raising you than I thought.

525
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:18,214
Or perhaps...

526
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:23,225
...you've finally learned the value
of directness from your friend...

527
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:24,623
...Clark Kent.

528
00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:28,192
He's a very interesting young man.

529
00:39:37,276 --> 00:39:38,937
- Hi.
- Hey.

530
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:44,975
- Here.
- Thanks.

531
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,251
I went by Jessie's.
They've completely cleared out.

532
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:53,016
Well, maybe they stopped running
and have gone to the authorities.

533
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:56,458
I just hope she's all right.

534
00:40:03,102 --> 00:40:06,799
You know, Dad, the things that I did
and I said, I really didn't mean them.

535
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:08,503
Clark...

536
00:40:08,674 --> 00:40:12,303
...the red meteor rocks might have
affected your personality, but...

537
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:15,770
...we gotta face it,
those feelings all came from somewhere.

538
00:40:15,948 --> 00:40:19,907
Now, I know compared to Lex, we don't
have a whole lot around here, but...

539
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,883
...up until now, I never
really thought it bothered you.

540
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:24,419
Maybe it does.

541
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,025
Sometimes.

542
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:31,159
And then I remember
what's really important...

543
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,958
...and none of that matters.
No matter how crazy I got...

544
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:37,899
...you two stood by me. That's something
all the money in the world can't buy.

545
00:40:45,144 --> 00:40:49,080
- But, still, it was a very close call, son.
- I know.

546
00:40:50,149 --> 00:40:54,210
When I put that ring on, I felt this sudden
urge to tell the whole world my secret.

547
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:57,219
- Lex, Lana, Jessie.
- But you didn't, Clark.

548
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:59,914
I know, but the feelings are still there.

549
00:41:00,092 --> 00:41:03,789
It's like I have these two identities
and I don't know which one's the real me.

550
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,487
The real you is the one
who came back to us...

551
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:09,793
...and we never had any doubt
that you would.

552
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:34,150
Nell told me you were riding, that this
is one of your favorite places. It's pretty.

553
00:41:35,027 --> 00:41:37,928
I got a little lost along the way, but...

554
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,457
...here I am.

555
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:42,263
Those for me?

556
00:41:43,035 --> 00:41:44,662
Yeah.

557
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:46,598
I wanted to apologize.

558
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:50,401
I was hoping maybe we could be friends,
like we were before.

559
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:55,604
So you thought that if you brought me
flowers, I'd pretend like nothing happened?

560
00:41:56,615 --> 00:42:00,051
You have to believe me.
The things I said, the way I was acting...

561
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:01,811
...that wasn't me.

562
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:04,785
Even the part where you said
you had feelings for me?

563
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,622
- Lana...
- Clark...

564
00:42:07,793 --> 00:42:11,320
...you can't have it both ways.
Either it was you, or it wasn't.

565
00:42:15,467 --> 00:42:18,163
Wish I could explain, but I can't.

566
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:21,203
Story of your life.

567
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:27,242
Lana...

568
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:29,346
...I really am sorry.

569
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:31,740
I know you are.

570
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:34,381
It's not enough anymore.

571
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,914
Do you think you can
find your way home?

572
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:44,389
Hope so.

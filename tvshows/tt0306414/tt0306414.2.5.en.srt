2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,500
My man.

3
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,700
Ain't but $290 here.

4
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,400
Goddamn it, Frog,
when you work a g-pack for a guy...

5
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,300
a kickback's supposed to be $500.

6
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,800
Stash got hit, yo.

7
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,700
I ain't hearing that shit!
I want my fucking money!

8
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,800
You'd best know
I ain't playing, motherfucker.

9
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,100
Okay, that's how you want it? Fine!

10
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,300
But when I roll back past here tomorrow,
money gonna be right, or you gonna see.

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,900
You gonna see who you're fucking with!

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,300
Do I look like a fucking punk?

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Yo, shorty.

14
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,500
Get me a Snapple
and a bag of crab chips from the corner.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,100
What the fuck is your problem, asshole?

16
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,200
Fuck, this is bad shit!

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Fuck, this is really bad.

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,500
Shit.

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,900
Get your ass out that car.

20
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,000
All right!

21
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,200
Shut up.

22
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,000
Where the money at? Check his socks.

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,800
You got something for me here, Zig?

24
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,200
You got some dough for me, man?

25
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,900
Jesus, jackpot.

26
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,300
Man, hold up, man.

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Ain't enough here to really
call this shit money, man.

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,100
Cheese, take it easy, I'm working on it.
But my people, you know....

29
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,500
What the fuck you think this is, man?

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,200
What, you think this supposed
to get played some other way?

31
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,500
Is that what you think, man?

32
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,200
Damn it, son of a bitch, that hurt.

33
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,500
Yeah, I know it did.

34
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,000
All right, look, how about the coat?

35
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,700
Take the coat, all right?

36
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,600
I paid two large for it...

37
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,700
so that, plus the cash I gave you...

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,100
and then I can get $700 more
by the end of the week.

39
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,900
You know I will!

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,400
You know right there, you can fix that.

41
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,800
$2,000?

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,500
For this?

43
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,900
Not even a black man could style that shit.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,900
You know what I'm saying, man?

45
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,200
What you laughing at, man?

46
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,000
Chill, be cool about it.
I'll get your money by Friday.

47
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,900
Then you'll see there's no need
to get all fucking dramatic out here!

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Look, man, if I ain't paid by Friday,
you dead by Saturday, man.

49
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,000
Yo, take my man's ride.

50
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,200
Fuck, I need that! I fucking need that!

51
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,100
Fuck you!

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why me?

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,100
You don't want the posting,
I'll take someone else.

54
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,200
Valchek gave me the pick of his district.

55
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,900
I'm not saying I don't want it.

56
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,900
I'm asking why you would choose me
after what happened last go around.

57
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Yeah, I thought about that, too.

58
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,100
Looking at the list of names
on the southeastern roster...

59
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,800
I'm saying to myself:

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,700
"Why take a man
who already burned you once...

61
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,100
"who already proved himself disloyal?"

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,700
Now, why would I do that?

63
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,500
I have no fucking clue, Lieutenant.

64
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,300
Because if I caught him once...

65
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,600
he might be the last
son of a bitch to try it twice.

66
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,200
I'm guessing you got enough
shame from the last time...

67
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,200
so that it won't happen again.

68
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,900
No, sir, it won't.

69
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,300
One other thing...

70
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,900
as far as I'm concerned,
those stripes on your sleeve aren't earned.

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,300
Your paycheck may say "sergeant,"
but on this detail...

72
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Det. Greggs runs your team.

73
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,700
Same as it ever was.

74
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Well?

75
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,800
I'm in.

76
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,300
Come here, you sweet bitch.

77
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Motherfu--

78
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,700
Don't be grabbing my dick, faggot.

79
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,800
I raised him on the radio.
He's on his way in right now.

80
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,400
Appreciate that, Officer. Nice day.

81
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,000
Summit Silver 450.

82
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,700
Top of the line, right here.

83
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,400
Over there?

84
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,900
Yo, Bubs.

85
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,700
McNulty, the sailor man? Watch the front.

86
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,900
Here. Stick that on that thing there,
will you?

87
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,100
The cleat? Ain't you know nothing?

88
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,900
Look at you, I don't know,
maybe it's just me...

89
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,700
but something's way the fuck
wrong with this picture.

90
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,600
What the hell is that?

91
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,800
A Baltimore knot.

92
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,600
What the hell is a Baltimore knot?

93
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,500
I don't know, but it's never
the same thing twice.

94
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,700
What can I tell you?
My detecting days are over.

95
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,000
What the fuck you have me
hunt up Omar then for?

96
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,000
That's old business. You remember Bird?

97
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,300
His trial's up next week.
Omar's got some witnessing to do.

98
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,900
He said you can reach him
here at this number.

99
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,600
You can leave a message.

100
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,400
Good work, Bubs.

101
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,000
As always. Here.

102
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,500
Cab fare.

103
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,500
You say tit-for-tat,
and we let slide on a little county caper.

104
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,000
I got to think that, you know,
you need to think about...

105
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,500
what you had me
endeavoring to accomplish.

106
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,100
I mean, what the fuck, man?

107
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,900
I'm not out there asking about
no random-ass, who-give-a-damn nigger.

108
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,800
No, sir. I'm making inquiries in your behalf...

109
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,200
in regards to that fucking unforgiving,
motherfucking Omar, man.

110
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,600
Why? He play you hard?

111
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,900
I go at him respectable...

112
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,500
he put that goddamn
shotgun in my face, man.

113
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,700
I'm looking at two tubes
of the harbor tunnel...

114
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,300
staring right at me, each one about yea-big.

115
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,800
I damn near pissed in my pants...

116
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,000
and he stood smiling like this shit is funny.

117
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,400
It ain't funny.

118
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,500
McNulty, I know I'm paying
taxes on some things...

119
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,300
I got to believe this
is more aggregation than:

120
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,900
"Good work, bubs," and a little bit of this.

121
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,100
For your pains.

122
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,700
Where are we at with the Jane Does?

123
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,600
Taking a hard look at the port,
we're gonna drop a grand jury summons...

124
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,600
on every stevedore who worked the ship,
keep rattling cages.

125
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,400
How's the port police broad
working out for us?

126
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,000
She knows the docks okay.

127
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,600
No detective, though.

128
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,800
In that case, you need someone fresh.
Cole, maybe, Massy or whoever's up.

129
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,400
You need to get over
to the southeastern today.

130
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,300
You're detailed temporarily.

131
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,800
Colonel, respectfully,
did you just fuck me over...

132
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,000
without giving me even half
a chance to clear this case?

133
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,300
Let's be clear, Det. Freamon.
When I fuck you over, you'll know it.

134
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,000
You'll be so goddamn certain,
you won't need to ask the question.

135
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,300
And you, Det. Moreland,
are now all alone with 14 red names.

136
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,200
How's it feel?

137
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,000
And the parking pad in the rear
is invaluable for Federal Hill.

138
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,700
The deck has a harbor view?

139
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,400
Yes, in two directions.

140
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,200
Go on up, take a look. I think you'll love it.

141
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,900
-This ain't Federal Hill.
-Excuse me?

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,800
This is the Point, Locust Point.

143
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,600
As far as real estate goes,
anything that is below Montgomery Street...

144
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,400
and above the water
is now called Federal Hill.

145
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,100
Are you two house hunting?

146
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,400
We just started.

147
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,100
If you're interested in this area,
I could run some listings for you.

148
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,700
-This particular house--
-Is my aunt Treesey's.

149
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,800
Really, your aunt?
ls she a relation to the McDonalds?

150
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,500
Nope. She's a relation to me.

151
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,700
She died, like, four years ago.
The family sold the house right after.

152
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,600
Is that the price?

153
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
That's the listing, yes.

154
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,600
They ain't gonna get that much, right?

155
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,600
I can't say for certain, but one just like it...

156
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,200
in the 1 200 block
sold for $340,000 last week.

157
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
$340,000?

158
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

159
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,000
Maybe we should rent.

160
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,900
We're here because Valchek wants us here...

161
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,200
because he believes this man
and his down-at-the-heels union local...

162
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,500
has too much money.

163
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,300
To start with, you and Freamon
are gonna put some DNRs...

164
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,900
on the union hall phones.

165
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,300
Also, run what you can on the
union finances and on Sobotka personally.

166
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,600
We put that together, copy it to the major
to show him we're on it...

167
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,500
and buy ourselves a little time.

168
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,900
Meanwhile, you three, do what you do best.

169
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,600
Find out where port folks like to cop
on a Friday night...

170
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,900
set up some hand-to-hands,
maybe a reverse or two.

171
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,100
A lot of these port guys are white,
aren't they?

172
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,600
I mean, some of the southeast
street dealers, too.

173
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,700
So that means
you're gonna need a white boy...

174
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,700
to go down to some of these
southeastern corners, right?

175
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,700
So Kima, Carv on the rooftops.
It's my time to front.

176
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,300
I'll show you how it's done, homes.

177
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,400
Cool Lester smooth.

178
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,000
What's happening?

179
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,700
Same fuck-ups in the same shit detail...

180
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,600
working out of the same
shithouse kind of office.

181
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,200
You people lack for personal growth,
you know that?

182
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,500
It's a temporary posting.
Rawls gets you back at the end of the run.

183
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,400
If he wants me.
Last I looked, I was high on his shit list.

184
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,300
-Then we did you a favor.
-I wouldn't go that far.

185
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,300
But fuck it. Who we chasing?

186
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,100
Frank Sobotka?

187
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,300
-How fucking good is he?
-You know the man?

188
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,800
Me and Bunk Moreland
were fucking with this guy last week...

189
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,000
working that case about
dead girls in the container.

190
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
He a suspect?

191
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,300
No, just someone who know what's
getting done on the port terminals.

192
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,800
-Why are you on him?
-My father-in-law hates his guts.

193
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,200
Which, in the southeastern,
goes for probable cause.

194
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,500
Valchek thinks he has too much cash.

195
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,900
So you're thinking drugs?

196
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,300
In this fucking town,
what other crime is there?

197
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You know I would've been
down here sooner, it's just...

198
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,300
with Terrell being sick and all....

199
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,000
But, Dee, I got everything we need paid for.

200
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,800
When you come home, Stringer's
saying they gonna hook you up...

201
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,800
with something out of the mix.

202
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,500
Like running a club,
or straight business, like.

203
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,800
String say they gonna
keep you apart from it...

204
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,100
and give back some time for family.

205
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,800
For you and me and Terrell.

206
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,700
Family?

207
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,800
They thinking about
how they can do for you.

208
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,200
They making all these plans...

209
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,100
even though you been
playing cold with your uncle.

210
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Stringer says so, anyhow.

211
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,900
Why you be like that?

212
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,000
Throwing them off
when they looking to do for you?

213
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,500
They playing you with that
"We're family, and it's all about love."

214
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,700
That's how they do.

215
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,700
When they got no more use for you,
that family shit disappears.

216
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,900
It's just about business, Donette.

217
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,000
Dee, they gonna be there for us.

218
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,300
What's up, man? You got that Death Grip.

219
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,700
-You know Stony got that check.
-Slow down, fool.

220
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm saying you need to spend that shit here.

221
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,900
-Death Grip be the fucking bomb, yo.
-I ain't got no ends.

222
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,300
Motherfucker said it ain't shit.

223
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,100
No, I ain't say that.

224
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,500
That's enough, yo, let that shit be.

225
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,200
-Fuck you all.
-Yeah, motherfucker?

226
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,000
Yo, B.

227
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,400
Shit jumping off in the Pit, yo.

228
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,300
Damn.

229
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,300
What the fuck was that?

230
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,300
Fiend badmouthing our shit,
saying Death Grip ain't all that.

231
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,600
Now we're beating niggers
over speaking the truth?

232
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,500
I ain't hit him, the young'uns, yo.
You can't tell these fools nothing.

233
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,300
We stomping niggers over bullshit, man.

234
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,500
Somebody got to pull Stringer up on this.

235
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,000
Zig, what's up?

236
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,200
Jesus, Zig, what the fuck happened?

237
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,100
Fucking niggers got me.

238
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
What?

239
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,800
Took my money, and they got Princess, too.

240
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,100
You hear me? They got my fucking car.

241
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,100
If I had a gun, I swear to God...

242
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,700
I would've capped every one
of those motherfuckers.

243
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
-You call the cops?
-Can't.

244
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,700
It was over some dope.

245
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,900
You bought a fucking package, didn't you?

246
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,800
Serves you right, you stupid fuck.

247
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,900
From who? White Mike?

248
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,600
This nigger Cheese,
up on Wolfe and Ashland.

249
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,400
-A few ounces, you know?
-Why not White Mike?

250
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,200
Fuck Mike, you know how he be.

251
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,000
Why the fuck would I know how he be?

252
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,900
Nicky, it ain't my fault, all right? It ain't.

253
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,600
Look, business has been slow,
package ain't turned around yet.

254
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,100
But the fucking hoodleheads ain't hearing it,
so I get jumped.

255
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,200
They got Princess, man.
They're holding her for fucking ransom.

256
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,700
And now they're telling me...

257
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,000
if I don't have the money by Friday,
they're going to kill me.

258
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,400
I need $2,700.

259
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
So?

260
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,900
You're a drug dealer,
go sell some fucking drugs.

261
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,700
You fucked up the package, didn't you, Zig?

262
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,400
I ain't giving you the money.

263
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,000
They're gonna kill me.

264
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,100
I gave my money to Aimee for an apartment.

265
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,100
Security deposit and some
furniture over at Littlepages.

266
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,600
I ain't got it for you, Zig.

267
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,700
You cocksuckers.

268
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,300
-Major in?
-Yeah, just knock.

269
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,500
Yeah?

270
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,300
We're about to make some
hand-to-hands around the port.

271
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,600
Lt. Daniels said I should see you about
a surveillance van.

272
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,700
The van?
The van's on loan to the southwest.

273
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,600
Okay.

274
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,700
Fuck with my ass, will you?

275
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,600
Bringing us back to our old friends,
supply and demand.

276
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,100
All right, your research papers are here.

277
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,300
Remember Friday, take-home test.

278
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,600
Well done, Mr. Bell.

279
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,600
-Mr. Lucas, you got five minutes?
-Absolutely.

280
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,300
There's something
maybe you can help me out with.

281
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
I'll try.

282
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,700
What are the options
when you got an inferior product...

283
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
in an aggressive marketplace?

284
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,200
If you have a large share of the market,
you can buy up the competition.

285
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,600
And if you don't?

286
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,600
Reduce price to increase market share.

287
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,300
That assumes low overhead.

288
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,900
Of course, otherwise,
you operate at a loss...

289
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,700
and worse, as your prices drop...

290
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,200
your product eventually
loses consumer credibility.

291
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,100
You know, the new CEO of WorldCom
was faced with this very problem.

292
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,500
The company was linked
to one of the largest fraud cases in history.

293
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,300
-So he proposed--
-To change the name?

294
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Exactly.

295
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,400
Which one?

296
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,400
He's got a weenie in his hand.

297
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,700
On this case, ain't that you?

298
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,100
Thomas Pakusa, come on down.

299
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,600
What the fuck is that?

300
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,200
Grand jury summons.

301
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,700
Grand jury?

302
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,500
You lie to us, you hurt our feelings.

303
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,800
You lie to them, it's perjury.

304
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,500
And one more I just dropped
on your barbecue chef outside.

305
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,600
You used to be a lot more fun,
you know that, Bea?

306
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,500
That's John Spamanato right there.

307
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,300
Johnny Fifty. How you doing, Officer?

308
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,200
Johnny Fifty?

309
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,700
What the fuck is that?

310
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,100
Son of a bitch drinks 53 beers
on his 25th birthday.

311
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,500
So as to be, what do you call it,
poetical, we rounded it off.

312
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,200
"Grand jury for the circuit
court of Baltimore City."

313
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,500
You worked the Atlantic Light, right?

314
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,700
Everybody on that ship testifies.

315
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,900
About what?

316
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,900
About them girls in the can.

317
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,000
The detective here thinks
we know something about that mess.

318
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
He thinks we'd leave them there
on the dock...

319
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,900
in a box, dying there in the dark because....

320
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,700
Because why, Detective?

321
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,600
What reason would we have
to want girls to die like that?

322
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,800
Why would any of us leave them in there
if we knew anything about it?

323
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,100
I got a wife and three sisters.

324
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,100
And they got daughters.

325
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,800
And I got too much respect for women
not to be pissed off...

326
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,400
at what's in your heads right now.

327
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,800
Of all the cans on the terminal,
that's the one you lose in the stacks.

328
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,700
We didn't know shit, goddamn it!

329
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,500
You want us to dance
with a grand jury, we will!

330
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,500
What do you say, Johnny?
What do you say to any question?

331
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,900
I take the fifth commandment.

332
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,300
And if they offer you immunity
to testify against your union brothers?

333
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,300
-I don't remember.
-Don't remember what?

334
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,500
Nothing.

335
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,000
What you're forgetting
is that every I.B.S. Iocal on the East Coast...

336
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,500
has had its ass in front of a federal
grand jury two or three times already.

337
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,800
You want to throw your summonses?
Throw them.

338
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,000
You want to subpoena our records?
You don't need a subpoena no more.

339
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,900
Our books were open
to the Justice Department for eight years.

340
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,500
We're here through
Bobby Kennedy, Tricky Dick Nixon...

341
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,300
Ronnie "The Union Buster" Reagan,
and half a dozen other sons of bitches.

342
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,300
We'll be here
through your weak bullshit, no problem!

343
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
These four ain't working today.

344
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,500
You wanna leave the papers here...

345
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,500
I'll make sure they get them
and go downtown on them.

346
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,100
Come on.

347
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,300
-Today?
-Now!

348
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,000
You described the weapon
used to kill Mr. Gant...

349
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,000
as a .380 semi-automatic.

350
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,700
You provided the size,
and even suggested the manufacturer:

351
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,100
"Australian, or one of those 'A' countries."

352
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,000
Is that correct?

353
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,200
Indeed.

354
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,800
And you were approximately
50 feet from the shooter?

355
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,400
Yes, ma'am, you know, give or take.

356
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,200
Mr. Little, at that distance
how were you able to determine...

357
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,600
who manufactured the weapon?

358
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,200
I wasn't.

359
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,200
Then how were you able
to relate that information...

360
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,700
to the detectives?

361
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,400
Bird showed it to me.

362
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,000
He showed you the weapon
before the murder?

363
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,900
Which murder we talking?

364
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,000
Bird committed more than one murder?

365
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,800
Fish got to swim,
you know what I'm saying?

366
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,100
Like I said before, Bird was
showing that thing to everybody...

367
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,500
talking about this deed and the next.

368
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,300
I didn't pay him no mind until you all came
and showed him some interest.

369
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,100
Mr. Little,
if you wouldn't mind waiting outside...

370
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,700
I'd like a few words with Officer McNulty.

371
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,100
I thought he did good.

372
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,300
Imagine the mileage
Maury Levy gets out of me...

373
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,600
putting that sociopath on the stand.

374
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,900
You got to admit, it'll be different.

375
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,400
Dress him up at least.

376
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,200
I can't have him on the stand
looking like that.

377
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,300
Here's a voucher for court clothes.

378
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,400
Anything with a tie.

379
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm saying, Dirt...

380
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,700
you wanna be my nigger,
you got to be with me for real.

381
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,700
You see what I'm saying, yo?

382
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,300
Well, I'll be.

383
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,200
All the time I be telling you, be on post.

384
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,600
But damn, homes,
you all the time up in some damn crib...

385
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,000
trying to play house with them bitches.

386
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,200
I'm saying, you all be seriously
fucked up because I'm out here...

387
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,700
getting done what needs done.
Feel me, nigga?

388
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,000
Thieving motherfuckers
take everything, don't they?

389
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,600
You know what I'm saying, Dirt.

390
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,000
You wanna be my nigger,
you gots to deliver for real.

391
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
How'd we do, Charlie?

392
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,100
I've almost got one of them ready to swear
that the docks are actually near the water.

393
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,300
They don't scare, them guys.

394
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,100
What now?

395
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,400
You telling me you never had
a CI down there, right?

396
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,100
A Cl?

397
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,000
An informant.

398
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,500
You ain't got no informants on the dock?

399
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,800
Someone you could go to on this?
Someone you got a history with?

400
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,500
They say a police is only
as good as his informants.

401
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,300
Meaning, we ain't about much.

402
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,800
The voucher says $150.

403
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,000
Look on the clearance rack.

404
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,100
-It's a look.
-No, it ain't.

405
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,500
You figure it out for yourself. I'm going
across the street to the federal building.

406
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,400
I'll see you in about a half-hour.

407
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Look, man, if I ain't here, I'm round
the way on Howard Street, Liddell's.

408
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,400
Either that, or I'll be with Muffy at the club.

409
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,400
Where's he at?

410
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Said he had to go get his props.

411
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,500
1 2-08.

412
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
12-08.

413
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,300
Request lateral with 1 2-10.

414
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,800
KGA, he can meet me on 6.

415
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,200
Do you copy, 12-08?

416
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,000
10-4, on 6.

417
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
Yo, dickhead, where you been at?

418
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,200
When you're working deep cover, Carv,
you got to get into the part.

419
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,100
What's up? You need a little help?

420
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,800
Maybe, bro. You got any raw up in here?

421
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,200
-You got it to spend?
-For sure.

422
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,600
All right, then we good.
Go and holler at my niggers round back.

423
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,100
Yo, Carv. You copy this?
It's all in the props, baby.

424
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,800
All in the props.

425
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,800
Feel any different? Me neither.

426
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,100
-Special Agent Cleary.
-Jim McNulty, from the city.

427
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,700
How can I help you?

428
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,700
Found floating off the Key Bridge.

429
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,400
We think she's linked to the dead girls
found in the container at Patapsco.

430
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,300
Your people were just here,
asking for a trace on the can.

431
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,900
-Homicide fellows.
-Black guys, Moreland, Freamon?

432
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,800
-Yeah, you working with them?
-Sort of, I fished her out.

433
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,600
I kind of feel like it's on me
to find her people.

434
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,600
You're kidding, right?

435
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,600
No, I thought maybe
if you guys have, you know...

436
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,600
been pulling in any women who've
been over here on the circuit.

437
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,800
Step into my world, Virginia.

438
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,600
A grand jury?

439
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,500
They snatched up some of our guys,
drove them downtown.

440
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,300
But you know nothing.

441
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,300
Yeah, no shit, we know nothing.

442
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,900
The only guy they got that even knows
you had a can that day was Horse...

443
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,400
and he ain't gonna say shit to nobody.

444
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,200
You sure?

445
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,100
Horse is a rock.

446
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,300
Don't ever worry about him.
My uncle neither.

447
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,000
But you say he wants to stop.

448
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,500
Yeah, for a little while.

449
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,100
He wants you to stop moving
cans through our docks...

450
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
at least until this shit chills.

451
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,600
These were local police, right?

452
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
Yeah.

453
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,700
Their interest is in the girls.

454
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,200
That happened on the ship,
the ship is gone.

455
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,500
A dead end.

456
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,800
The malaka they want,
we already got to in Philly.

457
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,600
Another dead end.

458
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,600
The police are going nowhere.

459
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,000
But, more important,
we address Frank's concerns.

460
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,900
You tell your uncle I will meet with him.

461
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,300
He says he wants to meet with the Greek.

462
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,700
Anything he can say to the Greek,
he can say to me.

463
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,900
Says he wants the Greek.

464
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,400
Says you tell him when and where.

465
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,900
Niko.

466
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,500
About that other business, the chemicals....

467
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,800
What do you need them for?

468
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,900
It's just business.
Everything is just business with us.

469
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,900
Buy for a nickel, you sell for a dime.

470
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,700
Yeah?

471
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,900
Who wants a dime's worth
of fucking chemicals?

472
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,800
So these are undocumenteds
from just this field office?

473
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,300
Maryland and Delaware only.

474
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,500
Any of them still in your custody?

475
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,100
I'd love the chance to show
some photos, maybe get lucky.

476
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,800
Everyone in that book was deported.

477
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,100
You can guess,
some of them are already back.

478
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,500
Any field office have anything active?

479
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,600
That's what I'm looking at right here.

480
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,100
You got some girls in custody
in San Diego, also Seattle.

481
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,600
Anything I can drive to?

482
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,400
Closest is a case up in Jersey,
Hudson County.

483
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,900
Raid on a couple clubs up there
put 1 2 in their bullpen four days ago.

484
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,200
That'll work.

485
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,200
So you really gonna go up there
on your own time?

486
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,700
I'll take a day, yeah.

487
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,900
What's between you and this girl?

488
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,600
You seen what happens down
at the morgue, when they can't ID a body?

489
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,800
I have.

490
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,900
Mau. How you been?

491
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,500
-Same old.
-Yeah?

492
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,000
You getting some days?

493
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,500
Pretty much.

494
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,600
I'm in the tower now, working the lanes.

495
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,200
You want to come in?

496
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,100
I got, I don't know, some beers,
maybe some Bacardi around.

497
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,900
Maybe we could just go
for a cup of coffee and talk, you know?

498
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,100
Let me get my jacket.

499
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,400
So I tell him,
"Dee, why you acting like that?"

500
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,800
He just sit there
like I didn't say a damn thing.

501
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,400
He off the damn hook.

502
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,400
You tell him about the plans, right?

503
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,600
I told him you all was gonna
set him up and everything.

504
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,700
And he know how you all been
doing for me while he away.

505
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,200
He knows some.

506
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,700
I mean, damn, he don't need
to know about it all, right?

507
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,200
Anyway, I'm saying I'll
get down there next weekend...

508
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,700
and he look at me like I ain't saying shit.

509
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,900
He say just leave him alone.

510
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,700
Got to turn that roast.
You gonna see, String, for real.

511
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,100
Little Donette know how to burn.

512
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,500
Your father bucking us, little man.

513
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,400
What you think about that?

514
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
Yeah. I think you're right.

515
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,700
What you looking at?

516
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,900
Fucking Ziggy, man.

517
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,400
I'm about to get my ass
shot behind his bullshit?

518
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,400
We're reasonable, they're reasonable.

519
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,800
Fuck that, maybe on your side of town.

520
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,800
What's up?

521
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,800
Came to see a man about a car.

522
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,700
Maybe tell Cheese we're here.

523
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,100
Yo, Cheese. White boy.

524
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,200
Yo, you got my money, man?

525
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,200
That's what we came to talk about.

526
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,300
Yo, you got to a lot of heart...

527
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,500
coming up in here
without my fucking money.

528
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,000
We thought maybe
we can work something out...

529
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,700
so you can get what's yours.

530
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,300
How you plan to do that?

531
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,100
You give the car back,
I'll get him to sell it off.

532
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,500
Camaro with a 350 in it,
it's got to be worth more than $3,000.

533
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,000
That's right clever. Right clever, I got to say.

534
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,200
And I appreciate you all
coming all this way so much...

535
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,600
I'll give the boy another week to pay.

536
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,500
Of course, that ride ain't
worth nothing near $3,000.

537
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,300
You don't believe me?

538
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,600
Have a look.

539
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,300
You show up at my door,
I'm thinking better thoughts than this.

540
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,100
And you counted on that?

541
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,700
Who else am I gonna ask?

542
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,500
I ain't no snitch, Beadie.

543
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Not even for you am I a snitch.

544
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,600
I'm not thinking about it like that.

545
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,700
I'm thinking, here's a guy,
and we had some times together...

546
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,400
and even though, you know, it didn't
get to where he might have wanted it...

547
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,800
he's still a good guy...

548
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,900
someone I can talk to about this.

549
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,200
How come it didn't go nowhere?

550
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,300
You did good. Who knows?

551
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,800
I don't know, you never know.

552
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,900
I could show you pictures of how they died.
Broken fingernails, blood on the walls.

553
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,900
All of a sudden, you're a cop.

554
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,400
Help me with this, Mau.

555
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,100
You didn't get shit from grabbing up
Horseface and them, did you?

556
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,200
It's kind of funny when you think about it.

557
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,400
I mean, you running around
like your head's all chopped off...

558
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,600
Iooking for someone to clue you in...

559
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,300
when a lot of what you're asking about...

560
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,900
is right there for the taking.

561
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,100
How so?

562
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,700
Used to be us checkers did
everything with paper and a pencil, right?

563
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,400
Every move on a ship, we wrote it down.

564
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,400
When that ship sails,
and there ain't no problems...

565
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,600
then that paper gets tossed.

566
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,700
That don't happen today, right?

567
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,100
Nothing gets tossed anymore.

568
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,800
The computer.

569
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,800
Thanks, Mau.

570
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,300
Well?

571
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,100
Good news and bad, Zig.

572
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,300
Those fucking niggers.

573
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,200
Give me the bad.

574
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,400
They're still gonna kill you.
They're gonna wait a week.

575
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
What the fuck can be good?

576
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,300
You can cancel your car insurance.

577
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,500
Let me get two red tops.

578
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,400
There we go.

579
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,900
I hope you guys are taking notes.

580
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,600
Shit.

581
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,900
One-and-one.

582
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,200
One more time with that toothpick,
I'm going to stab his eye with it.

583
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,600
Ashamed he should be to be Greek
and call this a diner.

584
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,500
A talk would ease his mind.

585
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,700
Ease my mind first.

586
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,100
This business with the grand jury.

587
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,500
We checked the courthouse.
There is nothing special.

588
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,800
Just the regular panels.

589
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,500
They're trying to scare
the men on the docks.

590
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,900
-And?
-Nobody talks.

591
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,700
But Sobotka, as I said, he's upset.

592
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,400
It is more attention than he expected.

593
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,000
He will need money for his lawyers.

594
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,500
Double his fee.
But I don't need to meet with him.

595
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,900
Let the money talk.

596
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,700
Everything we get from
Atlanta been walked on.

597
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,300
Each one weaker than the other.

598
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,200
And this nigger Roberto
is on the shelf to us right now.

599
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,600
I mean, it's getting hard
to hold onto the Towers...

600
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,800
without our name all over
the product is what I'm saying.

601
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,000
Who got the good shit?

602
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,200
Eastside.

603
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,100
Eastside, who?

604
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,700
This nigger Milton got a small cut,
Prop Joe...

605
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,800
this Jamaican cat who got
the strip off Gay Street.

606
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,500
You talking about Petey, Petey Dixon.

607
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,500
You go over to the expressway
at lunchtime...

608
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,900
you can watch the fiends
traveling from west to east.

609
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,000
Damn!

610
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,600
I mean, I'm cutting shit with shit right now,
trying to cheat, but sooner or later.

611
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,700
I hear you, man, I'm on it.

612
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,500
You working it out with Dee?

613
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,800
Boy got to find his own way.

614
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,700
I'm saying, you know...

615
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,900
I think we should keep
reaching out to this kid.

616
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,800
Give something to him and his girl.
I don't know, show them we got a plan.

617
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,400
Take some real estate, put it in Dee's name.

618
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,900
He has something to come home to.

619
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,300
Do it.

620
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,500
Thing is, String, what happened happened,
you know what I mean?

621
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,200
Push come to shove,
I've been fair to him, ain't l?

622
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,400
You've been fair.

623
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,600
Too fair.

624
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,700
-Where's the Greek?
-He sent me.

625
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,600
Fuck you, and fuck him.

626
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,900
Frank, he sent me to tell you
that we're doubling your fee...

627
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,500
to help with any legal troubles.

628
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,500
He also told me to tell you he regrets...

629
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,700
that you're still having problems
on our behalf.

630
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,400
They're throwing my people
in back of police cars...

631
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,600
and this asshole can't even talk
face to face?

632
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,200
I'm done. I'm out.

633
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,100
I need nothing more to do with you people.

634
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,900
I don't need the trouble or the money.
I got a union to run.

635
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,600
They used to make steel there, no?

636
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,900
Smoke from the stacks.

637
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,200
But inside....

638
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,800
Potassium permanganate.

639
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,200
Spell "permanganate."

640
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,800
F-U-C-K.

641
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,300
You even know what the fuck
you're doing there, Zig?

642
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,800
I'm in the checker's local, right?

643
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,100
You know, while you Local 47 boys...

644
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,500
were having bulk cargo
dropped on your heads...

645
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,500
we was out grabbing the future by the balls.

646
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,700
So you just type that shit in there
and ask it for an answer?

647
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,500
Let me ask you:

648
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,000
Why do we give a fuck what the shit is for?

649
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,700
If they want it, they want it.

650
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,200
I mean, besides,
if I don't get some money soon...

651
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,000
I'm fucking toasted.

652
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,500
I don't know who you've been talking to...

653
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,800
but we don't have
that kind of stealing going on down here.

654
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,200
-It's not like the old days.
-No?

655
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,600
A little here and there,
but for the most part...

656
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,500
the new technology
has changed everything.

657
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,300
Look, see this little box right here?

658
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,400
You fucking mind?

659
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,500
Ring's a little stressed right now...

660
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,700
having misplaced a frozen can
full of Japanese tuna steaks...

661
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,900
supposed to be at the Jessup
wholesale market by yesterday.

662
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,100
Bite me.

663
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,000
-Frank, these officers are--
-I know who they are.

664
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,800
Frank here helped set this system up.

665
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,900
He probably can explain it better than I can,
if he doesn't mind.

666
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,600
No problem, chief.

667
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,800
In a nutshell, what this shows...

668
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,100
is the Aqua Verde at Berth 4.

669
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,300
The plan calls for 85 moves.

670
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,800
That's cans, containers, coming off the ship,
and others going back on.

671
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,000
Now, look at the screen.

672
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,300
Every time a can goes on or off,
the computer creates a record...

673
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,900
and puts it in the permanent database.

674
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,200
He was saying the computer makes it
hard to steal off the docks.

675
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,400
Did our port manager tell you
that right now...

676
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,000
we got 160 boxes missing
off the Patapsco terminal alone?

677
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,800
Or that last time
we inventoried the truck chassis...

678
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,700
we came up 300 light?

679
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,400
No, I suppose not.
That's management for you.

680
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,600
160?

681
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,100
Not that all of them are stolen.

682
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,200
You can lose a can by accident, no problem.

683
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:33,000
For one thing,
these hand-helds use radio waves.

684
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,600
With all the equipment
and container stacks out there...

685
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,100
sometimes waves get knocked down.

686
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,900
That happens, a can don't get entered.

687
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,600
Or, just as easy,
a checker makes the wrong entry.

688
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:46,500
Either 'cause he's lazy, he's sloppy,
or he's still shitfaced from the night before.

689
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,700
Or, simpler than that, you got fat fingers.
No offense.

690
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,200
So imagine February on the docks.

691
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,400
You're wearing Gortex gloves,
trying to punch numbers on that thing.

692
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,600
You're saying
that's what happened to the can...

693
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,300
with the girls in it?

694
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,400
Beadie, darling,
I don't know what happened there.

695
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,500
I'm just saying, if you go by the computer...

696
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,800
it might look like
there's some dirt going down...

697
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,000
when it's really just a glitch in the system.

698
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,200
The customs seal was broke on that box.
Shouldn't that get noticed?

699
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,800
You're offloading a ship
the size of a small town.

700
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,000
You might notice a broke seal,
you might not.

701
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,100
Look, you wanna keep
pulling our chain, you can.

702
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,300
But it ain't like it's just
that one box that went missing.

703
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,000
We lose them sons of bitches all the time.

704
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,800
-Frank give you everything you need?
-He did, thanks.

705
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,400
They're playing us.

706
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,700
You drove all the way from Baltimore
on a hope and a prayer?

707
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,500
Yeah, I'm dead-ended on this.

708
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,300
Is there anything we can offer
any of them for cooperation?

709
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,200
You could marry one of them,
make her an American housewife.

710
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,000
Short of that, they're going back the fuck
where they came from.

711
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,000
-Where do you hold them?
-County detention.

712
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,800
We keep the undocumenteds
out of gen pop.

713
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,100
You all heard of WorldCom?

714
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,400
All right, let's try this.

715
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,000
You all get jacked by some knockos.

716
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,800
But you all clean.

717
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,700
You all got an outstanding warrant,
like everybody in here.

718
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,300
What do you do?

719
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,800
Give another name.

720
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:27,900
Why?

721
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,900
Because your real name ain't no good.

722
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,900
All right, it ain't good and....
Follow through.

723
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,500
All right, Death Grip ain't shit?

724
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,900
Then change up the name.

725
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,200
What else?

726
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,700
Yo, I got it, change the caps
from red to blue, right?

727
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,100
Make it look like we got
some fresh shit, boom.

728
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,500
You know what else we might could do?
Give each tower its own name, right?

729
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,100
And then we do, like, some fake competing.

730
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,100
So, a fiend gets some bad shit from one,
he'd go back to the other.

731
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,100
There's a thinking man, right there.

732
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,300
See, nigger,
ain't that what the fuck I just said?

733
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,200
You and my uncle talk?

734
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,800
How'd it go?

735
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,700
No problem.

736
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,300
Three boxes.

737
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,300
All of them on the Wilhelmina.
And you should tell your uncle...

738
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,100
that it's three times the usual fee for each.

739
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,800
We checked on those chemicals.

740
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,400
We looked into that.

741
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,500
I was worried, you know?

742
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,500
Before I deliver, I wanna know
what you need it for.

743
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,800
A bomb or some shit?

744
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,000
I ain't down for that.

745
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,600
You use that shit
to process drugs, don't you?

746
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,800
Cocaine.

747
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,800
You still want it,
I got it on the Fairfield piers.

748
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,300
No problem.

749
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,400
When?

750
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,700
End of the week.

751
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,600
Maryska.

752
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,300
She's good with English.

753
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:33,800
They're dead.

754
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,000
All I'm trying to do is
get word to the families.

755
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,100
What did she say?

756
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,500
She wants to know,
if she knows a girl, does she get to stay?

757
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,800
You want a good restaurant for dinner,
or are you headed right back?

758
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,700
A computer?

759
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,000
To run a trace on the missing containers
in the port administration's database.

760
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,200
You're looking for what?

761
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:04,300
A pattern for our case. We need to know
who left those girls on the dock and why.

762
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,400
We're supposed to be on Sobotka
and the checkers union anyway...

763
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,100
so folding one investigation
into the other makes sense.

764
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,000
Not to me, it doesn't.

765
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,900
I'm not bringing your open murders...

766
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,500
anywhere near this detail,
that's a loser for us.

767
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,600
Lieutenant!

768
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,400
We bring in a few drug rips,
and show that we gave Sobotka...

769
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,700
and his union a quick, fair look,
it's more than enough for Burrell.

770
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,100
He returns the favor,
and I'm out of the basement...

771
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,000
and running an investigative unit again.

772
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,200
You dirty me up with murders I can't solve.
It doesn't play like that.

773
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:35,700
Homicide's not the place
to sprawl a case, Lieutenant.

774
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,800
Rawls, Landsman...

775
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,000
they have no patience for anything
but a quick shake.

776
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,100
We got enough room for it here, anyway.

777
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,200
You can set up here at the off-site...

778
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,800
and we can share information.

779
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,400
But the murders stay with Homicide.

780
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,900
Unless, of course, you find a suspect.

781
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,900
Three ROIROs, four containers.

782
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,500
I got all my cards up,
including long numbers...

783
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,900
and we're still short.

784
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
-A good day.
-That it is.

785
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:55,000
Everybody works today,
even you, my little j-series wonders.

786
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,300
Even you.

787
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,300
Is Horse working the Wilhelmina today?

788
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,900
I told that motherfucker we were done.
I told him!

789
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,400
He said he talked to you.
He said it's triple-rate for every can.

790
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,100
Triple?

791
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,000
Call Horse in the tower.
Tell him he's working the Wilhelmina.

792
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,400
It's now or never for us, I got no choice.

793
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,400
Today we got ships, Uncle Frank. Today.

794
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,300
But the writing's on the fucking wall.

795
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,400
Fuck the wall.

796
00:55:44,305 --> 00:56:44,499

00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:55,556
I can't take
this shit, Bunny.

7
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:59,260
Hey, it'll pass.

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,861
They're just
riding you now.

9
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,464
Next week
it's somebody new.

10
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,499
Can't take away
your E.O.D., Marvin.

11
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,938
Worst they can do
is bust you back
to lieutenant.

12
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,306
I don't even
wanna think about

13
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,142
the worst these
motherfuckers can do.

14
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:17,411
You don't either.

15
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:25,919
Deputy Commissioner Rawls:
You're still not connecting
the dots, Marvin.

16
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,222
- ( faint click )
- Have a look.

17
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,590
Hoffman and Holbrook,
sir.

18
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,193
Very good.

19
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,195
You had a body dropped
there last week

20
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,996
and this is what the fuck
it looked like yesterday.

21
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,365
( clicks )

22
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:40,468
Bond and Preston,
for the record.

23
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:44,305
- ( clicks )
- Ashland and Wolfe.

24
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:45,806
- ( clicks )
- Chase and Durham.

25
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:50,778
Sir, I deployed my resources
per your instructions.

26
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:53,181
We beefed up
foot patrols,

27
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:56,116
we have our plainclothes
squads on 12-hour shifts.

28
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:57,351
And the corners
stay full?

29
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,686
They move, sir.
Every day.

30
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,224
They're gonna sell
their drugs somewhere.

31
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:06,294
Major Taylor,
I look at your numbers,

32
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:09,997
I see the intel reports,
the photos.

33
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:13,901
It all tells me that
you lack a fucking clue.

34
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,370
If you'll
permit me.

35
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,705
Is your deputy
major present?

36
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,474
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:26,046
You now command
the Eastern District.

38
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,049
Major Taylor,
you are relieved.

39
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,684
Take the podium.

40
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:44,698
Anyone else
having trouble with
the writing on the wall?

41
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,700
Dismissed.

42
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,738

43

00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,315
* You gotta
watch your back *

45
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,751
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

46
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,188
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

47
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,057
* Walk the straight
and narrow track... *

48
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:13,561
* If you walk with Jesus

49
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,497
* He's gonna
save your soul *

00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:21,335
* You gotta
keep the devil *

* Way down
in the hole *

52
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:29,377
* He's got fire
and the fury *

53
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,779
* At his command

54
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:34,782
* Well, you don't
have to worry *

55
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:40,688
* Hold onto Jesus' hands

56
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:44,124
* We'll be safe
from Satan *

57

* When the thunder rolls

58
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:51,665
* Oh, you gotta
keep the devil *

59
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:55,202
* Way down
in the hole... *

60
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:57,371

00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,246
* You gotta keep

* Way down in the hole

63
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,588
* Way down...

00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,925
* Way down in the hole.

65
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:28,569
And I'm like,
"Nigga, if you want
to sell me a new car,

66
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,738
you better really
sell it to me,

67
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:34,375
'cause otherwise,
I'm sittin' back and
I'm watchin'."

68
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,276
What you want
with a new ride for?

69
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,646
It ain't like you
can't get a new car

70
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:41,014
anywhere you want,
anytime, in this whole city.

71
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,516
- I'm just sayin'.
- Sayin' what?

72
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,752
- In case.
- In case what?

73
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,355
In case I ever want
to buy a new car.

74
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:48,856
Damn, is that
too much to ask for?

75
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,559
Girl, you crazy.

76
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,794
Shit, shit.
Get down. Get down.

77
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,009
( distant siren wails )

78
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,650
Yeah, they
feeling it now.

79
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,186
They protectin'
the fuck out of it, too.

80
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,622
You see what
you wanted?

81
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,592
Yeah, man.
But they got the whole
second floor boarded up.

82
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,760
Got a little
porch 'round back.

83
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,262
Couple of the boys
out there now smoking
on them menthols.

84
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,198
So we slide up
from the back?

85
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:34,134
That barred up, too.

86
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:35,703
Woman:
No way through
the front?

87
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,838
Not now.
But come tomorrow morning

88
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:41,442
they gonna scale
back down to a three-man
skeleton crew, ya feel me?

89
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,744
Not sure
I like this.

90
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,714
Why we gotta
keep hitting up
the Barksdale people?

91
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,216
Ain't like this whole
motherfuckin' city

92
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,918
ain't got stashes
all over it.

93
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,653
True that.

94
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,889
So why?

95
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,091
Because.

96
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,693
"Because"?

97
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,596
Indeed.

98
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,535
( phone rings )

99
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,272
So that's
a cop shooter?

100
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,575
Yeah, not much to him,

101
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,177
but he did that job on
the Dozerman kid last week.

102
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,879
Gave it up
in a full statement.

103
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:24,017
Before or after
you knocked the shit
out of him?

104
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,087
"Injuries were sustained
while patrol officers
were effecting

105
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:30,524
pursuit and arrest
of aforementioned suspects."

106
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,960
- He was caught
East Side, right?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,395
but the wagon
made a stop at
the Western District

108
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,698
for an unscheduled
tune-up.

109
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:39,967
It's dark
on that back lot.

110
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:45,639
Western boys mistook him
for a piñata.

111
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,542
- So what do you think?
- I think this is a tragic

112
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,144
motherfuckin' miscarriage
of justice.

113
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,247
I think it deserves
a special grand jury,
and if not,

114
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,417
the president should appoint
an independent prosecutor.

115
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,821
Oh, no, no, no, actually,
I think "Kofi Bryant"

116
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,423
and the United-fucking-
Nations should get involved.

117
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,158
It's a murder, Bunk.

118
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,694
The word from
upstairs is that

119
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,562
we supposed to be havin'
less murders, not more.

120
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:09,663
This is Anne
Arundel County.

121
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,465
Why should they
care about that?

122
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,334
- Why should you?
- Hey, Bunk.
Hey, how's it going?

123
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,336
Listen, um, Deputy
wants to know.

124
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,971
Have we recovered
Dozerman's service weapon?

125
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,773
No, sir.
The kid said he
sold it on the street.

126
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,875
Gave only the street
name of the buyer.

127
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,177
A certain "Peanut,"
whereabouts unknown.

128
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,346
- They want that gun back.
- Sir?

129
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,248
They don't want
to have a departmental
weapon on the streets.

130
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,250
You know,
as a principle.

131
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,685
( chuckles )

132
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,120
The great white
deputy has spoken.

133
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,189
This case is not down
until that gun comes home.

134
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,991
Fine, don't get up.

135
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,928
One of the most
heavily armed cities
in the gun-loving world.

136
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,563
Why should those
ignorant motherfuckers

137
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:46,700
care about one goddamn
semi-auto, more or less?

138
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,546
What'd you
bring me downtown
in this shit for, man?

139
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,213
Police
don't get wet.

140
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:04,685
Talk to me,
big man.

141
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,754
Thought you should know,
my boy Cheese,

142
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,689
he went into the box
with a couple of police.

143
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,057
- He stood tall?
- No doubt.

144
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,828
Kept his mouth shut
and waited 'em out.

145
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,931
Way it turned out,
they the ones that fucked up.

146
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,199
How come?

147
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,635
Police let it slip
Cheese played in
on some "talkies."

148
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,304
Tried to pin
a hit on him.

149
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,139
Said they had it
all over him.

150
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,374
Who got hit?

151
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:28,609
A dog.

152
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,477
What kinda dog?

153
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:33,647
Kind mistake
your leg for pussy.

154
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,085
So, they had
phones tapped?

155
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,088
Don't matter to me
none if they did.

156
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,625
Me and the people
I keep close,

157
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:45,893
we don't talk
on the phone none.

158
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:49,462
You talk on
the phone, String?

159
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:50,998
So we good then.

160
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:55,235
What we know is they
still looking hard at us.

161
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,807
You wanna know
what kills more police
than bullets and liquor?

162
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,875
Boredom.

163
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:05,345
They just can't
handle that shit.

164
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,815
You keep it boring,
String.

165
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:10,884
You keep it dead
fucking boring.

166
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,863
You're serious?

167
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,364
I am.

168
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,366
What's the closest
school to here?

169
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,901
Stuart Hill
Elementary.

170
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,738
That's at least
eight blocks.

171
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:37,410
Three sevens.

172
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,380
Three sevens?

173
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,316
Five eights.

174
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,785
Bullshit,
let's see it.

175
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,688
Five eights.
Read 'em and weep.

176
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,389
You're cheating.

177
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,024
I just can't catch
your ass is all.

178
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,894
It's just luck, Tony.
It's just luck.

179
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,363
You called my desk
looking for me?

180
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,464
Yes, I did,
come on in.

181
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,598
Grab a chair.

182
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,167
But watch your
wallet if you do.

183
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,270
Make it quick,
Tommy.

184
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,672
The new city
editor wants

185
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,807
a 40-inch weekender
on liquor board reform.

186
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,809
They're going to reform
the liquor board?

187
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,178
Yeah, with
a hand grenade.

188
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,883
So what's
on your mind?

189
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,885
We're off
the record?

190
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,954
There's going to be
no academy class

191
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,555
of police cadets
this year.

192
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,224
Mayor's orders.

193
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,593
Homicide rate's climbing,
felonies are up,

194
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:28,862
we got patrol
vacancies out the ass.

195
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,031
Even more coming
at the year-end retirements.

196
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,333
And this is coming
from His Honor?

197
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,736
- To what end?
- Keep some money.

198
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,705
Money's in the budget,
but even a six-month delay

199
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:39,406
in hiring saves
a couple million.

200
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,175
You think there's some paper,
something the mayor signed?

201
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,277
Nah, but you call
the personnel office

202
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,379
and they'll confirm
that the class is delayed
until next year.

203
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,981
You get
that much,

204
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,850
you can come back to me
for a couple of quotes.

205
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,253
You want in
on this?

206
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:56,389
No, indeed.
I love my mayor.

207
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,991
Councilman,
thank you.

208
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,628
Stirring up
some shit?

209
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:02,863
Just a little bit.

210
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:05,833
For the good of our
fair city by the bay.

211
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,036
Three twos.

212
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,877
Housing authority
has this slated for
demolition, right?

213
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:20,113
But no money
to do it yet.

214
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,648
Boss, you sure
it's a good idea

215
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,550
not to tell anybody
about this downtown?

216
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,719
Ignorance is bliss,
Lieutenant.

217
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,888
Anyone ever
tell you that?

218
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,489
Once, but
I beat the dog piss

219
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,059
out of the guy
with a nightstick.

220
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,895
Daniels:
Anybody seen McNulty?

221
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:37,664
Catch him up
when he posts.

222
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:40,467
New target.

223
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:43,036
Kintel Williamson,
goes by "Prince K."

224
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:46,639
Has a string of
corners from Park Circle
to Woodland Avenue.

225
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,641
And he's dropping
bodies, too.

226
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,377
Three in the last
four months,

227
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,180
or so say our friends
in the Northwestern
District.

228
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,115
So we're off
Proposition Joe's people?

229
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,051
We're going to ship
all the mid-level arrests
downtown to C.I.D.

230
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,487
Let Narcotics work up
those prosecutions.

231
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,989
After that, we're
on to new business.

232
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,457
He don't look
like much.

233
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,926
He's dropping
bodies.

234
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,695
And with everybody pressed
to bring the murder rate down,

235
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,497
that's the new mandate
for this unit.

236
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,400
- Bell has bodies
on him, too.
- Not lately.

237
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,769
And Prop Joe hasn't
made much noise either.

238
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,470
They're still
running product.

239
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,807
Still got kids
banging out there.

240
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,742
And now, 'cause we blew
a wire over a fucking dog,

241
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,477
we have to let
them just walk on,

242
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,080
go about their shit
like we were never anything

243
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,316
to take seriously
in the first place?

244
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:44,397
I want an investigative strategy
mapped out by week's end.

245
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,470
McNulty's here
in spirit anyway.

246
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,773
- ( laughing )
- What?

247
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,257
Inmate:
Fuck you!

248
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,566
Right there.

249
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,087
This will work, too.

250
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,457
There's a couple
occupied in the 200 block,

251
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,327
and that one
over there,

252
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:24,464
but, otherwise...

253
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,300
we're good.

254
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,839
Good shit, right?

255
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,474
Let's go.

256
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,243
Commissioner Burrell,
please.

257
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,311
- Woman: Who's calling, please?
- It's Councilman Carcetti.

258
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:41,014
- Hold, please.
- Burrell: Hello?

259
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,582
Erv, I'm givin' you
a heads up.

260
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:43,716
You're gonna get a call
from a Sun papers reporter

261
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,685
about the academy class.

262
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,955
- What the fuck?
Is this a joke?
- Calm the hell down, Erv.

263
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,522
You just "no comment"
the fucker.

264
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,058
You tell me my name
will be nowhere near this

265
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:53,060
and then send
a reporter my way?

266
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,528
Exactly.
Then you call
the mayor yourself

267
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,064
and you tell him you got
a reporter nosing around

268
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:59,132
about the academy
class getting pushed.

269
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,268
You tell him you have
no idea how it leaked.

270
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,602
I knew this shit
would come back to me.

271
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,571
Trust me, you're
covered on this.

272
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,806
Goddamn it,
You can't hang me out there
like this with the mayor.

273
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,341
My ass is flapping
in the breeze.

274
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:11,544
You want
that class, Erv?
You gotta trust me.

275
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,680
- Shit!
- ( phone beeps )

276
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,319
( distant siren
wails )

277
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:30,998
How you
even find me?

278
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,966
Ran into Lucas.

279
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,234
Don't even
call his name.

280
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,236
Nigger still
owes me money.

281
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:40,573
He just told me
how to find you,
that's all.

282
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,275
He tell you
how I'm doing?

283
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,879
Yeah...

284
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,749
I know what
you thinking.

285
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:52,119
You ain't looking
all that yourself.

286
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,354
You look
just fine, girl.

287
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,090
Just tryin' to find
your sister, that's all.

288
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,027
She ain't
for you no more.

289
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,996
She ain't for none
of our kind.

290
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,466
Gone out
county way.

291
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:07,934
Picked herself up

292
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,470
county clothes,
county car...

293
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:15,308
county nose to look down
on all us city niggers with.

294
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,546
She a teacher.

295
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:23,183
- Where at?
- Don't be rushin' me,
motherfucker.

296
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,289
I know you lookin'
to tip on out of here,

297
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,725
get your aftershave on,
get yourself correct.

298
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,436
She teach speech.

299
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:47,674
Make it so every nigger
sound like Condoleezza.

300
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,016
Up Ida B. Wells.

301
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,929
Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me, have you
seen this little girl?

302
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,066
This my baby.
Can you just take
that picture with you?

303
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,334
Thank you so much.
God bless.

304
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,069
Excuse me, have you
seen this little girl--

305
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,570
Lady, you gonna
have to back up.

306
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,572
My little girl.
Please, she's only
four years old.

307
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,841
I ain't seen your little girl,
you're gonna have to back up.

308
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,844
- Please, take a look at her!
Just look at the picture!
- I ain't seen--

309
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,513
How do?

310
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,097
( music playing )

311
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,839
Kimmy:
Let's go.

312
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,607
Where it at, man?

313
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,213
Back there.

314
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,891
So, what up, man?
You don't value my time.

315
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,326
Nigga, please.

316
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:17,096
Hand me that screw gun
and calm the fuck down.

317
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:26,739
( faint whirring )

318
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,712
( whirring continues )

319
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:54,501
( taps )

320
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,523
( rattles )

321
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,325
- ( gunshot blasts )
- Go! Go!

322
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:19,692
- ( gunfire popping )
- Clear!

323
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,529
Tosha, go!

324
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,697
- D, go. I got your back.
- Kimmy: Go, Dante!

325
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,435
Oh, I got you, baby.
I got you.

326
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,703
Go! Go!

327
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,339
Yo, go, Tosha, go!

328
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:35,808
( gunshots crackling )

329
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,449
( car alarms blaring )

330
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,850
Yo, y'all ready?

331
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,321
Let's bang out.

332
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,998
Go, go, go!

333
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,466
Go!

334
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,061
Come on, Kimmy,
get in the car!

335
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,496
Get in
the car, man.

336
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:18,378
Mayor Royce:
Your department leaks
like a fucking sieve.

337
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:21,481
It could be someone
over here at the Hall.

338
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:24,484
Someone on your staff.
Someone on the council.

339
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,218
Mayor:
Well, it doesn't
matter now.

340
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,488
We gotta spin it
the best way we can,
which means we need you

341
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,490
to step up
and take this one
for the team, Erv.

342
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,425
- Me?
- Yeah.

343
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,327
Tell the newspapers
that the academy class

344
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:35,795
has been delayed
for some reason.

345
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:39,265
Lack of recruits, problems
in your personnel division.

346
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:42,068
- Keep it in your shop.
- After which,
the mayor steps in,

347
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:44,604
announces we'll have
an academy class
in January

348
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,038
come hell
or high water.

349
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,707
Do it like that,
it's a one-day story.

350
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,344
Mr. Mayor, this was
a budget question.

351
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:54,280
I was directed
to delay that class.

352
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:57,183
You took the hit then
and you're taking the hit now.

353
00:21:57,283 --> 00:22:00,553
And I thank you for
both... Commissioner.

354
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:08,327
( keys clicking )

355
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,730
( phone ringing )

356
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,099
89?

357
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:16,068
And that's just the ones
with West Side addresses.

358
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,470
Man, you gotta narrow
that shit down,

359
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,606
find some way to work
with all them Peanuts.

360
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:23,075
Motherfucker,
do I look like
George Washington Carver?

361
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,914
( mutters )
Shit. Cocksuckers got me

362
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,150
chasing one gun
through a city full of 'em.

363
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,685
Homicide. Yeah.

364
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,353
Dispatcher:
Two down, Pall Mall
and Pimlico.

365
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:37,790
Pall Mall and Pimlico.
Got it.

366
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:43,229
Two down,
in the street.

367
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:46,032
Ray Cole's up.

368
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:48,468
Cole is in
court today.

369
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:51,538
And I caught that cutting
in Cherry Hill last night.

370
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,207
Don't look at me.

371
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:58,511
I'm in the haystacks,
looking for Dozerman's
prodigal gun.

372
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,581
You gonna make me go
back-to-back as a primary?

373
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:05,518
That's some
cold shit, Bunk.

374
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,694
Agg assault with a 2x4?
I don't think so.

375
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:15,928
Put that
with the part twos.

376
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:19,398
This one too.
Assault by pointing.

377
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,534
If you don't use
a handgun,

378
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,303
you don't get credit
for waving it, right?

379
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,572
Larceny here.

380
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:28,374
Hump wrote this up
as a daytime B&E?

381
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:31,711
Fuck this.

382
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:35,448
Do it clean.

383
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,850
Don't massage anything,
don't sex anything down.

384
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,519
We give 'em
the fucking truth.

385
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,954
What about COMSTAT, boss?
They'll rip you.

386
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:44,591
There's five months
to my 30, right?

387
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:49,829
Fuck 'em if they
can't take a joke.

388
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:54,200
Rawls:
The major no doubt
has some explanation,

389
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,703
some excuse, if you will,
for a weekly felony
tabulation

390
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,407
that's going
in the opposite direction
from the other eight districts?

391
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:03,342
I have none, sir.

392
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,745
You are content
with this?

393
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:06,979
No, Deputy,
I'm unhappy.

394
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,484
I wish we were making
more of an impact.

395
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:14,721
But doing
what we're doing,

396
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:16,789
it's clear
that's not the case.

397
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:20,192
Major Colvin,
I am under the impression

398
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,628
crime is down
in the Western.

399
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:23,996
Perhaps you misfigured
your felony stats this week.

400
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,635
No, sir.
We were very accurate.

401
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:32,204
Sometimes the gods
are uncooperative.

402
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,974
Uncooperative?

403
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:38,144
This is a cooperative
effort, a cooperative
department.

404
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,112
Why, in the
Eastern District,

405
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:44,083
Lieutenant Daniels
exemplified this new spirit
just the other day.

406
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,753
And because of that,
we got two fresh homicides
in the black

407
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,655
and a lot less bodies
on the streets than
could have been

408
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:50,456
had that drug war
been allowed to drag on.

409
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:51,658
Mayor has me taking
the hit in public

410
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,860
for the late
academy class.

411
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,628
- You're kidding me.
- Rawls: Sacrifice
for the greater good.

412
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,797
Where's the fucking
loyalty, I ask you?

413
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,700
But in the Western,
what do I get from
a veteran commander?

414
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,304
You're just having a laugh,
aren't you, Bunny?

415
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:08,174
You got the real stats
and projections
somewhere else.

416
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:10,710
Someone's just outside
the door with them, right?

417
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,944
A stripper, maybe?

418
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,681
( chuckles )
That would be nice.

419
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,082
She comes in,
flashes a little tit,

420
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,316
gives us a whiff
of that muff

421
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,118
and delivers
my fucking stat sheets

422
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:22,321
with a reduction
that matches just what
we promised the mayor.

423
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:24,390
That would be
beautiful.

424
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,526
That would be
crème fucking brulée.

425
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,430
But what I got instead
is some half-assed,

426
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,966
"I-wish-we-were-doing-better"
platitude

427
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:37,436
that's meant to fool
maybe a six-year-old girl

428
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,438
into thinking
you're doing your job.

429
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,574
Well, she's left the room,
Major Colvin.

430
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:44,243
She's out there right now
asking the stripper

431
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,112
if she can have her job
when she grows up

432
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:49,248
because she sure as shit
doesn't want yours!

433
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:52,151
You know why?

434
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,553
Because there isn't gonna be
a goddamn Western District

435
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:56,923
in 20 years
if this shit keeps up.

436
00:25:57,023 --> 00:26:00,359
I don't care how many years
you have on this job.

437
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,695
If the felony rate
doesn't fall,

438
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:05,164
you most
certainly will.

439
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,734
The gods
are fucking you,

440
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,568
you find a way
to fuck them back.

441
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,503
It's Baltimore,
gentlemen,

442
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:14,807
the gods
will not save you.

443
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:18,878
Kids:
You on my team.
You a G.

444
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:24,817
Kid 2:
I ain't on nobody's team.
I'm not playing that...

445
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:29,021
Kid 1:
Come on...
We're on the same team.

446
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:34,193
- Give me that.
- No, I found it.

447
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,864
She look like
a player?

448
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:40,532
- Bystander?
- Kid: Come on, let's go.

449
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:43,169
Right in the middle
of it all if she was.

450
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,806
- Hm.
- Kid: Over here.

451
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:49,876
Kid:
Get down,
they're coming out.

452
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:55,214
Kids:
Pshoom! Pow, pow, pow!

453
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:04,857
Yo, my turn
to be Omar.

454
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,525
No.

455
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,161
Boy:
Give it, gimme.

456
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,667
Look, I'm tellin' you,
I was there.

457
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,669
"White folks"
was on the stoop
by the 909 Club,

458
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,437
an' Apex just
standin' over his ass,

459
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:20,940
pumpin' more holes in the boy
than a motherfucker need.

460
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,009
- Shit, I ain't lyin'.
- ( whistles )

461
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:24,610
Soon as that motherfuckin'
nine stops talkin',

462
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:25,912
"White folks" looks up
at Apex, says,

463
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,479
"Bitch, is that the best
you got"?

464
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,081
Man, I'm
jus' sayin',

465
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:34,186
a boy got that
much white blood,
he got to be a punk.

466
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:35,587
You want me,
boss?

467
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:38,090
Your numbers
way down, Fruit.

468
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,492
Way down.

469
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,228
It's Barksdale's
people.

470
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:45,231
They clippin'
the dope fiends
comin' up Fremont.

471
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,435
You know,
when I ran a shop

472
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,003
an' my numbers
dropped,

473
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,272
I damn sure did
something 'bout it.

474
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:57,744
- Yeah, I hear that.
- I just want 'em moved.

475
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:01,948
Take the young'uns with you,
give 'em a workout.

476
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:04,016
All right.

477
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:08,855
So, Lieutenant,
you got an "attaboy"

478
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:10,222
from the deputy
today, huh?

479
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:14,593
Cost me my
wiretap, though.

480
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,864
Still, it's good work
over in the Eastern.

481
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:20,266
Knocking down
a drug war.

482
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:23,169
Yeah, he's gonna do
the same thing for me
up on Park Heights.

483
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:25,504
I got this Kintel
Williamson character

484
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:26,873
who needs some fixing

485
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:28,640
and Rawls promised me
Daniels and his unit

486
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,642
for about
a month or so.

487
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:33,012
You're getting quite
the rep there, kiddo.

488
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:36,048
So Stan, what's your plan
for the Southeast?

489
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,050
How you gonna give
Rawls his numbers?

490
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,252
I don't know.
Flex squads on
the corners,

491
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,790
foot patrols
in the Perkins Homes,

492
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,324
overtime
out the ass.

493
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:48,694
And if that don't work,
cheat on the stats.

494
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:50,596
( chuckles )
So what say you?

495
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:55,835
Shit, me?
I'm gonna go to 12-hour
shifts on the weekends.

496
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:58,104
What about you,
Bunny?

497
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:00,139
I dunno.

498
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,777
I thought I might
legalize drugs.

499
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:07,814
- ( elevator bell rings )
- ( laughing )

500
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:11,884
So they hit
the goddamn alley,
and we on 'em.

501
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:14,686
That cocksmokin' motherfucker
with the big-bitch gun?

502
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,823
He was runnin' hard
on his ass, but--

503
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,424
I think
I hit him.

504
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:19,859
Nigga, you ain't
hit nobody.

505
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,460
I mighta
hit him.

506
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,329
Yo, String,
we hit the one girl,

507
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,966
but after that,
man, I ain't see nobody
catch no lead, man.

508
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:29,468
- 'Cept for Tank?
- Yeah, Tank gone.

509
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:32,704
The other broad dropped him.
So I guess we even now.

510
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:35,407
So you get one,
right?

511
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,776
- Yeah.
- That's good.

512
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:39,545
That's like
a 40-degree day.

513
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:43,449
Ain't nobody got nothing
to say about a 40-degree day.

514
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:47,119
50, bring a smile
to your face.

515
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:51,257
60? Shit, niggers
is damn there barbecuing
on that motherfucker.

516
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:54,226
Go down to 20, niggers
get their bitch on.

517
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,028
Get their blood
complainin'.

518
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:00,166
But 40?
Nobody give
a fuck about 40.

519
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:02,634
Nobody remember 40
and y'all niggers

520
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,637
is giving me way too
many 40-degree days!
What the fuck?!

521
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,806
( cell phone rings )

522
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,177
Yeah.

523
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,646
Now, we're gonna cover
that bitch's funeral,

524
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,183
her fucking wake--
we're gonna be all over
that motherfucker

525
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:18,951
till the bitch
hit the ground.

526
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:20,819
And if the faggot
roll up to pay
his respects,

527
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,889
we're gonna be
on that motherfucker--

528
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:24,723
yo, who the fuck
you talking to, man?

529
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,059
It's Donette, String.
She been callin'.

530
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,863
No, put
the phone down.

531
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,565
Y'all feel me
on this?

532
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,334
Yeah, yeah.

533
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,203
Yeah.
He show up,

534
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:40,172
- we on him
like a motherfuckin'--
- Like a 40-degree day.

535
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:20,179
So, overall,
felonies are down,

536
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,281
but murders
are still up.

537
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,383
- What's our next move?
- Let me bump overtime

538
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:28,254
and court pay for
Homicide and district ops.

539
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:31,323
Cases go into the green
before they go into the black.

540
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:33,125
Done.

541
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,594
And, of course,
if we could get some
help at the courthouse,

542
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,363
it would go
a long way.

543
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:39,131
Hey, if you're going
to try and dig your way
out this,

544
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,732
don't make me
your shovel.

545
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,169
My department is bringing you
casework that goes nowhere.

546
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,571
The cases are thin.
Most wouldn't make it

547
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:48,140
past a prelim
in the court of
a freshman judge.

548
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,376
Well, maybe if your personnel
weren't so goddamned concerned

549
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:52,444
for their goddamned
conviction rate,

550
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:54,480
- they'd chance
a whodunit or two.
- Oh, for Christ sakes!

551
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,184
Jesus, at least pretend
you're on the same side.

552
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,253
Stephen, you and I
are both going to be

553
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:02,721
counting votes
this time next year.

554
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,257
Do something to help
our sorry asses.

555
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,826
And Erv, if you
want to do more than just
finish out Walker's term,

556
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,661
show me something more
than a pass of the buck.

557
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:16,368
I don't think
any of us wants to
have to get a real job.

558
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,070
( laughing )

559
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,710
- Mr. Mayor.
- All right.

560
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,380
- I'll see you both in here
on this next week.
- Thank you, sir.

561
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,783
( door closes )

562
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,685
Like children.

563
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,022
Demper's always
been a hack,

564
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:39,058
but he's an elected hack,
so we're stuck with him.

565
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:41,427
But Burrell,
though?

566
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:43,862
You're vulnerable
on crime, Clarence.

567
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,032
You need to set
some deadwood adrift.

568
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:49,301
- Burrell's got friends.
- The ministers?

569
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:53,539
( chuckles )
He might be their man,
but so are you.

570
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:56,575
You fire Burrell,
you get some new
blood in here,

571
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,344
the crime rate
drops, huh?

572
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:00,379
The ministers
will live with it.

573
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:04,450
So you're tough
on deadwood, huh?

574
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,685
In the new 11th
District too, I hear.

575
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,522
Mr. Mayor, it's time
for Eunetta to go.

576
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:13,525
She's had her time,

577
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,694
there are better people
out there for the council.

578
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,863
She's on the team,
Odell.

579
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,531
Just like my police
commissioner.

580
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:24,436
I value loyalty.
Don't you?

581
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,006
Bunky-Bunk.
Where's my Bunk?

582
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:33,479
Cole's up, not you.

583
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,581
You're on
Dozerman's gun,
remember?

584
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,784
Cole's at
the courthouse.
Sue me.

585
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:41,320
Rawls and Foerster
have crawled up
into my backside

586
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,489
and they're gonna
stay there until you
find Dozerman's gun.

587
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:45,691
Now, I would like it
very much if I could

588
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:49,528
unclench my
ample asscheeks,
if you don't mind,

589
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:52,598
and rid myself
of that discomfort.

590
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,366
Jay, I just caught one
that pushed its way

591
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,802
all the way
to the top of my stack.

592
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:59,771
A victim, Jay.
On the real side.

593
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,741
Do tell.

594
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,343
Second body
in a double.

595
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:07,146
Girl in her 20s,
caught in the middle
of a firefight,

596
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:08,447
takes one
in the dome.

597
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,815
But she's still dead
in a zip code

598
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,617
that does not
fucking matter.

599
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:15,721
And you still owe me
a departmental-issue nine.

600
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:18,190
Find the fucking
gun, Bunk.

601
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,434
Bunk:
Fuck me.

602
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,369
Kintel Williamson,
who the fuck?

603
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,003
He has corners
in Park Heights.

604
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:33,205
But Jesus,
who doesn't?

605
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:34,940
So all day we're
calling you, Jimmy,

606
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,109
wonderin'
where you were at.

607
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:38,244
Kima, maybe you
can enlighten us.

608
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:40,512
Pshh.
Don't look at me.

609
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:43,615
My runnin' buddy
don't even tell me
where he's off to these days.

610
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,051
I was
at the library.

611
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:49,421
- Bullshit.
- The library
at M.C.I. Jessup.

612
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,092
D'Angelo Barksdale
was not a suicide.

613
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,395
- The M.E. tell you that?
- He didn't need to.

614
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:58,063
The physical evidence
didn't match up.

615
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:00,399
Look, I don't like
coming up off of Stringer

616
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:02,067
and Prop Joe
any more than you do,

617
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:04,803
but McNulty, this shit
is kinda weak.

618
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,738
Cedric is under
a lot of pressure

619
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,740
to use this unit to get
the murder rate down.

620
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,810
So, for now,
Stringer Bell's jacket
belongs in Narcotics.

621
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,812
Man took you
off a boat, Jimmy.

622
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:17,283
He want to peel
his unit off?
His unit, Jimmy,

623
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:20,819
and go after
the target of his choice?
Baby, it's his call.

624
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,821
Lester,

625
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:25,724
I thought you were
all about the best
case possible.

626
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,660
When it's there,
I am.

627
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,256
( sizzles )

628
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:01,293
( gasps )

629
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,485
Yo, I need y'all
to hear this, man.

630
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,559
It was my fault.

631
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,294
Ya hear me?

632
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:37,796
I'm sorry, yo.

633
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,501
That don't do
nothin' for me.

634
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,654
( sighs )

635
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,658
How come...

636
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,928
they know you're police
when they hook up with you.

637
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:13,465
And they know you're police
when they move in.

638
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,200
And they know
you're police

639
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:18,870
when they decide
to start a family
with you.

640
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,072
And all that shit
is just fine

641
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,542
until one day
it ain't.

642
00:37:23,642 --> 00:37:26,878
One day, it's,
"You should have
a regular job.

643
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:30,749
- ( chuckles )
- You need to be
home at 5:00."

644
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,784
- "You need to call more."
- I'm sayin'.

645
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,288
"You need to stop
fucking waitresses."

646
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:40,025
( chuckling )

647
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,762
I wanna come down here
tomorrow to Western.

648
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:47,366
See what's what since
those towers came down.

649
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:50,168
We're supposed to start
on Kintel tomorrow.

650
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,171
Oh, fuck that chump.
He can wait a day or two.

651
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,442
Yeah, okay.
What the fuck?

652
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,781
- ( bottle crashes )
- Kima: Wow.

653
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:06,184
When you were humpin'
a radio car in the Western,
was this your hole?

654
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,819
Yeah.

655
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:10,922
Here and down
on Winchester
under the bridge.

656
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:14,292
Bet there were a lot
of nights you didn't
go home to the missus.

657
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:19,097
Don't tell me
I'm the same kinda asshole.

658
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,800
Pucker up,
girlfriend.

659
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,535
Jesus.

660
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,605
- I'm turning into McNulty.
- ( McNulty laughs )

661
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:29,475
( thumping )

662
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:39,184
( humming softly )

663
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:42,354
( siren wails, passes )

664
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,644
( TV news anchor
speaking )

665
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:08,380
Hey, I'm getting ready
to go now.

666
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,516
No, Mee-maw,
you know I can't.

667
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:13,385
Times like these, honey,
you have to shine.

668
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:14,886
In your face,
in your clothes,

669
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:18,857
and in your pocket.
Now, go on.

670
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:21,927
You make sure you get
something to eat, hear?

671
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,062
Go on, now.

672
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,640
- Kima: You know 'em?
- Not a clue.

673
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,613
Crew on that corner
looks familiar.

674
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:48,887
A couple old faces.

675
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,456
Not many.

676
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:53,959
You go away for a year
and the whole world
changes up.

677
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:57,429
Quiet, though.

678
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,264
Barksdale
loses the Towers

679
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:02,568
and he's
able to stretch out
without bodies falling?

680
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:05,370
I wonder what
the Western guys
have been seeing lately.

681
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:07,706
( cell phone rings )

682
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,943
Yeah?

683
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,378
Hey, Jay.

684
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:14,946
Yeah.

685
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:21,753
- What the fuck happened?
- Jay: He just collapsed...

686
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:23,354
When?

687
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:26,692
How is he?

688
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,529
Aw, shit.

689
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,935
You'll let me
know, right?

690
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:40,706
Okay, yeah.

691
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:42,007
Thanks.

692
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:45,977
You know
Ray Cole?

693
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:48,880
Homicide, right?

694
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,751
Collapsed in the gym
at the Central District
this morning.

695
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:53,985
On a fucking
Stairmaster.

696
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,955
Well, how is he?

697
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:59,991
A Stairmaster.

698
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,234
Hey, Poot,
check it out.

699
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:10,669
- Where they at?
- I don't know.

700
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:13,004
- ( tires squealing )
- Poot: Oh, shit!

701
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:15,106
Yo, yo,
look out, man.

702
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,476
( screams )

703
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:26,985
Break it, break,
motherfuckers!

704
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:30,756
- Man said break. Come on.
- I was workin' that bitch.

705
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,023
Yeah, shorty,
you hard.

706
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,894
We outta here.

707
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:42,033
( coughing, gasping )

708
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:47,773
"The commissioner
acknowledged that money

709
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:49,541
had been budgeted
for the academy class,

710
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,910
but said the department
was awaiting approval

711
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,912
of a federal training
and education grant

712
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,481
before scheduling
the program."

713
00:41:56,582 --> 00:41:58,917
Burrell can talk
some shit, can't he?

714
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:02,020
Uh-oh, Downtown
in the house.

715
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,421
Hey, Kima, baby.

716
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,190
Hey, Ellis.

717
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,726
Herc.

718
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:09,895
So, what do we owe
the pleasure?

719
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:12,831
Cruisin' your district,
seeing what's up since
the Towers fell.

720
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:14,966
We see Barksdale crews
on a few corners,

721
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,935
but no one seems to be
beefin' with 'em.

722
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,570
What's up with all this
brotherhood?

723
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,038
We keep the lid
on tight.

724
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:21,807
You know, they know
we are not their friends

725
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:24,042
and they damn well know
we'll take it to 'em

726
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:25,310
if they don't
behave.

727
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,079
What do your C.I.'s
tell you?

728
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:30,682
Fuck C.I.'s.
We don't need no
stinkin' C.I.'s.

729
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:32,851
We tune 'em up,
we beat 'em down,
we lock 'em up.

730
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:35,621
It's the Western
District way.

731
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:40,626
Sergeant,
you're wanted in roll call
for a supervisor's meeting.

732
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,963
Gotta go.

733
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,068
Remember
what I told you?

734
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,370
Police is only as good
as his informants.

735
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,072
Well, we ain't downtown
no more, Kima.

736
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:56,608
We're in
the trenches here.
You want information,

737
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:58,777
you go get your own C.I.
and you shoot the shit.

738
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:07,552
You're late,
Sergeant.

739
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:09,755
I had a couple downtown
detectives in my shop.

740
00:43:09,855 --> 00:43:12,257
They were confused
and required assistance, sir.

741
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:14,025
( laughter )

742
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:19,164
Well, I'll
catch you up.

743
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:22,100
The new strategic plan
for the district

744
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,869
is to move
all street-level
trafficking

745
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:26,071
to these
three areas.

746
00:43:26,171 --> 00:43:28,774
- We want to push it.
- "Push it," boss?

747
00:43:28,874 --> 00:43:31,309
If they don't go easy,
then they go hard.

748
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:32,477
But...

749
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:34,612
we let these
knuckleheads know

750
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:36,047
that if they move
to these areas--

751
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:38,650
away from
the residential streets,

752
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,619
away from commercial areas
away from schools--

753
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,055
if they take their shit
down the road,

754
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:46,324
they can go about their business
without any interference
from us.

755
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:49,995
It's going to be hands-off
in the Western District

756
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:51,529
for the foreseeable
future.

757
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,131
Bullshit, man,
no fuckin' way.

758
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:54,866
Wait, wait.

759
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,835
You're saying you want us
to give them a free pass?

760
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:58,103
How we going to
look them in the eye?

761
00:43:58,203 --> 00:43:59,537
Officer:
They'll shit all over us.

762
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,572
Tell their kids
to shit all over us.

763
00:44:01,673 --> 00:44:03,909
Hey, the major
wasn't finished.

764
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:08,413
You gotta take
the long view here.

765
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:10,481
Once...

766
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:14,786
once they're all comfortable,
once they're all rounded up,

767
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:16,521
once they've been
down there a bit

768
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:18,223
and they're used to
putting their feet up

769
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,658
and playing
with the remote,

770
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:23,228
then we move.

771
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,196
Then we go back
and we do police work.

772
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:28,834
Look at it this way,
gentlemen...

773
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:31,102
would you rather shoot
a fish in the ocean,

774
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:33,872
or would you rather
gather 'em up

775
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:36,708
in a few
small barrels

776
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:38,243
and start emptying
your clips then?

777
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,178
Not to mention, you still
get to kick the shit

778
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:42,413
out of all the mopes
who don't move off
our corners.

779
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,515
( laughing )

780
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,084
So, it ain't
all bad.

781
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:54,392
Slow up, girl.

782
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:56,161
Come on now.

783
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:58,029
( remote chirps )

784
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,303
So, this your ride?
It's nice.

785
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:06,938
Suppose
you got a Lex.

786
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,239
Nah, girl.
Got a bus pass.

787
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:12,077
You out
the game, then?

788
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:14,412
Doing a little
landscaping right now.

789
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:17,048
But tryin' to figure
things out.

790
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:22,253
So, what's
your boy's name?

791
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,155
Allen.

792
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:27,092
- After Iverson?
- After his daddy.

793
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:32,730
What?

794
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:35,801
Trying to picture you
mowing a lawn.

795
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:40,038
Yeah, I don't be
wearin' this suit.

796
00:45:40,138 --> 00:45:42,841
- You look good in it still.
- You look good too.

797
00:45:42,941 --> 00:45:45,143
You know, they bought
a lot a folks out

798
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,012
with early retirement
in Parks and Rec.

799
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:49,280
I could maybe hook you up
with someone to talk to.

800
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:52,884
A man at my church
is helping the city

801
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:54,685
fill a lot
of those jobs.

802
00:45:54,786 --> 00:45:58,389
That would be--
thank you.

803
00:46:00,892 --> 00:46:03,194
Write your
number there.

804
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:05,196
He'll call you.

805
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:11,469
I gotta go.

806
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,471
It was good
seeing you.

807
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,242
Grace?

808
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:20,211
Looking at you...

809
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:22,013
What?

810
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:23,714
Hurts.

811
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:26,217
Shouldn't
look, then.

812
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:32,357
( engine starts )

813
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:39,564
Food blast'll
take yer mind off it.

814
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:42,800
Rather my mind
on it, Bubs.

815
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:45,003
Swear I'm sick
of all this, man.

816
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:46,337
Wonderin'
when I got so old.

817
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:49,274
Some more
mac n' cheese, man.

818
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:51,609
- Hey, Bubs.
- Kima.

819
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:53,178
Hey, Bub.

820
00:46:53,278 --> 00:46:55,346
"McNutty," man,
my mainest man.

821
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:57,949
- You ready
to put some work in?
- Born ready.

822
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:00,919
- Snitchin'?
Fuck that, Bubs.
- Hey, hey, nah, man.

823
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:03,588
Better than liftin'
500-pound radiators.

824
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:05,323
I'm up for these two,
Johnny.

825
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:07,625
It's easy money, man.

826
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:09,260
C'mon, let's grab
a burger.

827
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:13,231
Mind if I bang
outta here early?

828
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:14,966
I ain't right
with this Cole thing.

829
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:18,036
Gonna be a detectives'
wake at Kavanagh's tonight.

830
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:21,006
- You gonna come?
- Barely knew the guy.

831
00:47:21,106 --> 00:47:22,473
Y'all layin' him out
at the bar, huh?

832
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,242
Tradition.

833
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,977
Tomorrow night,
he goes to the funeral home
for family.

834
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:28,146
Tonight, Ray
drinks with the boys.

835
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,582
C'mon, Bubs.
We ain't got all day.

836
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:37,255
Carcetti:
He's up for re-election

837
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:38,890
and he's never had
a single one

838
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,425
of his "goo-goo" bills
pass the committee.

839
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:43,261
So, he's got one
for all-day kindergarten.

840
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,729
I mean, who's gonna argue
with more kindergarten?

841
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:46,464
I mean, this guy
has got a bill

842
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:49,935
which is the legislative
equivalent of kissing
a baby.

843
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:52,203
So, right, he goes
to his chairman,
pleads his case

844
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:54,372
and says,
"You know, this don't
go through, I'm torched.

845
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:56,841
I'm going to be back
in that hardware store,
mixing paint."

846
00:47:56,942 --> 00:47:58,709
So the chairman
takes pity and agrees.

847
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,178
He gets the bill
to the floor.

848
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:02,447
But the house speaker?
He hates this bill.

849
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,315
So, it gets "loved
to death," you know--

850
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:07,318
slaps on an amendment
for another 150 mil
in costs,

851
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:09,854
subsidies, handouts
and the bill goes down
in flames,

852
00:48:09,955 --> 00:48:11,256
122 to 10.

853
00:48:11,356 --> 00:48:13,291
The delegate, he can
smell those paint cans.

854
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,426
And the chairman says,
"Hey, sorry, brother,

855
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:18,263
I fought like a tiger
for that bill."

856
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:19,664
( laughter )

857
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:21,066
Man:
Who wants friends
like that?

858
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:24,169
You want friends
in this racket?
Get a dog.

859
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:25,937
- What?
- Man: Look, we real busy.

860
00:48:26,037 --> 00:48:29,840
- I need to talk to him.
- I gave him the message.

861
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:31,776
Look, just tell him
it's Donette.

862
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:34,845
- You sure he knows you?
- Yeah, he know
who the fuck I am.

863
00:48:34,946 --> 00:48:36,447
- Yo, String, she say--
- Not now.

864
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:40,585
Look, he say not now.
I gotta go.

865
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,388
( cell phone beeps )

866
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,627
- Marlo?
- It's a problem, String.

867
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:54,966
Club soda
and lime.

868
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:56,467
You'll never
get there that way.

869
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,305
Get where?

870
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,243
Excuse me.

871
00:49:07,012 --> 00:49:08,313
( clicking )

872
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:09,981
How the hell
was I to know

873
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:12,017
the mayor was gonna
put the screws to you?

874
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:16,021
You read the paper?
I look like shit.

875
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:18,489
Hey, you got
your class,

876
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:22,493
and probably
scored points with Royce
out of sheer loyalty, right?

877
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:28,699
( music playing )

878
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,518
( clinks )

879
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:55,693
We are police...

880
00:49:57,762 --> 00:50:00,165
so no lies between us.

881
00:50:00,265 --> 00:50:03,968
He wasn't
the greatest detective

882
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:06,337
and he wasn't
the worst.

883
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:10,141
He put down some good cases
and he dogged a few bad ones.

884
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:12,643
But the motherfucker
had his moments.

885
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,979
Yes, he fucking did.

886
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,016
You remember
the Mississippi extradition,

887
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:20,351
- the arson murders?
- Hey.

888
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:22,653
He brought
that case home.

889
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,190
And the triple
at the after-hours
over on Hudson Street?

890
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:26,557
That was Ray Cole
at his best.

891
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,561
And Fayette Street--
in '93, the drug wars.

892
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,501
He took a lot of hot
corners and cooled 'em.

893
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:39,537
Yes, indeed.

894
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:42,573
He... he won
as much as he lost,

895
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:47,345
much as any of us.

896
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:54,018
( sighs )
For Christ's sake, Hugh,

897
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:56,554
play the fucking song
already.

898
00:50:58,223 --> 00:51:00,358
Did he piss off
a wife or three?

899
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:03,628
- ( laughing )
- No fucking doubt.

900
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:06,864
I think the last one
actually kinda got used
to him, thank God.

901
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:08,199
( laughter )

902
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:10,368
Did he say the wrong shit
now and then?

903
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:13,671
Did he bust balls
and cheat on his taxes

904
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:16,040
and forget to call his mother
and fuck the wrong broad

905
00:51:16,141 --> 00:51:18,676
for the wrong fucking reason
every now and then?

906
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:20,245
Who fucking doesn't?
Christ.

907
00:51:20,345 --> 00:51:22,480
Was he as full of shit

908
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,150
as every other sad-sack
motherfucker

909
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,718
wearing a badge
of Baltimore City Police?

910
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,654
Abso-fucking-lutely.

911
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:33,023
His shit was as weak
as ours, no question.

912
00:51:33,124 --> 00:51:36,127
But Ray Cole
stood with us...

913
00:51:36,994 --> 00:51:39,130
all of us...

914
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:43,067
in Baltimore,
working,

915
00:51:43,168 --> 00:51:46,671
sharing a dark corner
of the American experiment.

916
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,379
He was called.

917
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:58,183
He served.

918
00:51:59,184 --> 00:52:02,086
He is counted.
Old King Cole.

919
00:52:02,187 --> 00:52:04,789
All:
Old King Cole!

920
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:21,539
All:
* The Cadillac
stood by the house *

921
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:25,743
* And the Yanks
they were within *

922
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:27,678
* The tinker boys,
they hissed advice *

923
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:31,682
* "Hot-wire her
with a pin" *

924
00:52:34,419 --> 00:52:38,689
* Then we turned and shook
as we had a look *

925
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:43,127
* In the room
where the dead men lay *

926
00:52:43,228 --> 00:52:47,265
* So Big Jim Dwyer
made his last trip *

927
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:51,736
* To the shore
where his father's laid *

928
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:53,571
* But 15 minutes later

929
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,573
* We had our first taste
of whiskey *

930
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,342
* There was uncles
giving lectures *

931
00:52:57,442 --> 00:52:59,310
* On ancient
Irish history *

932
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,111
* The men all started
telling jokes *

933
00:53:01,212 --> 00:53:02,847
* And the women
they got frisky *

934
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:06,484
* At 5:00 in the evening,
every bastard there
was piskey *

935
00:53:06,584 --> 00:53:08,519
* Fare thee well
going away *

936
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:10,421
* There's nothing left
to say *

937
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,423
* Farewell
to New York City, boys *

938
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,459
* To Boston and P.A.

939
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,227
* He took them out
with a well-aimed clout *

940
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:17,728
* He was often heard
to say *

941
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:19,730
* "I'm a free-born man
of the U.S.A.!" *

942
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:24,335
( cheering )

943
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:28,038
I'm sorry, but I gotta
get these guys home.

944
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:30,708
But all things considered,
I think they did pretty well.

945
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:32,977
They were great.

946
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:35,646
And you were great,
really, Jen.

947
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:38,416
Besides,
I think they got all the
family shots they need.

948
00:53:38,516 --> 00:53:40,418
So, you'll
be a while,
though, huh?

949
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:43,754
Mmm-hmm.
Gotta work the crowd,
you know?

950
00:53:43,854 --> 00:53:45,590
Make 'em think
I'm worthy of
their faith.

951
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,091
- You are.
- Well, thank you--

952
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:48,826
- Most of the time.
- Bitch.

953
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:50,628
( chuckles )

954
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:54,765
Not too late if you
can help it, okay?

955
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,508
( engine starts )

956
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:17,788
- ( music plays within )
- Bunk: Jimmy...

957
00:54:18,823 --> 00:54:21,258
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

958
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,263
Shit is fucked.

959
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:32,870
You fucking wake up,
like any other day.

960
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:38,309
You fucking eat
and think about bills

961
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:40,244
and dry cleaning
and shit

962
00:54:40,345 --> 00:54:42,813
and fucking vacation

963
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:45,783
and your fucking
retirement plan and what?

964
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:49,820
Like that.

965
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:52,957
Like that.

966
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:57,127
He checked out
of here

967
00:54:57,227 --> 00:55:00,164
with you still
owing him a clearance
on that Omar thing.

968
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:01,832
Oh, I know, I know.
I fucking know.

969
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,470
Like that.

970
00:55:11,676 --> 00:55:14,479
On a fucking
Stairmaster.

971
00:55:16,581 --> 00:55:19,584
On a fucking
Stairmaster.

972
00:55:19,684 --> 00:55:22,853
( music continues
within )

973
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,824
Wake up an' die right,
you cunts.

974
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:31,796
( vomiting )

975
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:47,745
( woman moaning )

976
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,519
( grunting )

977
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:05,062
( grunts )

978
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,935
( moans )

979
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:21,546
( organ music
playing softly )

980
00:56:23,247 --> 00:56:25,916
( slurping )

981
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,536
( crickets chirping )

982
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:51,742
What's goin' on,
man?

983
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:53,944
( tires screeching,
music playing within )

984
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:56,146
That whip
is pretty, yo.

985
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,048
I gotta get me
one of them joints
one day.

986
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:01,018
- Hm.
- Shit, yeah.

987
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:16,467
( music playing )

987
00:57:17,305 --> 00:58:17,550

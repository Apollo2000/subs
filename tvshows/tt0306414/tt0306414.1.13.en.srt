00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:15,848
(groaning)

3
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:25,307
<i>Hey, now.</i>

4
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:28,944
(laughing)

5
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:32,614
We called earlier,

6
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,650
they said
you were up.

7
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:38,320
Time we get here,
you back asleep.

8
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,424
Been there long?

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,159
No.

10
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:46,595
20 minutes.

11
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:51,300
You know, we didn't want to
exactly disturb you, you know.

12
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:54,436
I'm bored is all.

13
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,889
Yeah, but still.

14
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,942
So, what you
got for me?

15
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,144
Spreads?

16
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:04,196
Uh, yeah.

17
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,688
Little Man.
For sure.

18
00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:15,374
That's good.
Are you able to write?

19
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,835
Okay.

20
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,004
Number two.

21
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:39,431
<i>I can make Little Man,</i>

22
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:42,017
<i>'cause he's</i>
<i>in the front,</i>

23
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:45,604
trying to snatch the cash
off the dashboard.

24
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,995
But the other one,
he's outside in the dark.

25
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,998
So...

26
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:59,067
You know, it's okay.
It's okay.

27
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:02,204
Uh, is there anyone here

28
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,456
that you do recognize?

29
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:08,026
Sure, Wee-Bey.

30
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,083
All right.

31
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:18,720
Let me tell you
where we're coming from
with the shooters.

32
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,440
<i>We tracked</i>
<i>their escape route,</i>

33
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,659
and Landsman came up
with their hoodies.

34
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:27,296
Now, DNA matched
human hair

35
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:29,097
from one of the hoodies
to Wee-Bey.

36
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:31,316
Freamon, he tracked
a call from the pay phone

37
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:35,320
near the scene
to Stringer Bell's pager.

38
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:38,273
Now the caller was
using Bey's beeper code.

39
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:42,944
Crime lab, they lift
a print off a soda can

40
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,581
near that phone and that
matches Little Man.

41
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:51,370
You know, so--
you know, I'm saying...

42
00:02:56,594 --> 00:03:00,012
okay, hear me out.

43
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:02,814
There's a downside here.

44
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:05,967
We don't
have the guns,

45
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:09,938
no prints from the scene,
no witnesses.

46
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:13,842
But worse,
we gonna be dealing with
a Baltimore City jury,

47
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:16,945
and a good man is hard
to find in this town.

48
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,249
12 of 'em together
especially.

49
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:31,176
An ID of both
your shooters

50
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,680
will play a whole
lot easier come trial.

51
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,436
Yeah.

52
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,375
Sometimes things
just gotta play hard.

<i>(police radio chatter)</i>

75
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,919
Yeah, we got everyone
on our list except CCO.

76
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,621
Yeah, we hit
his mama's house

77
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,391
and she says that he went up
to Wabash for some court date,

78
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,976
so you might wanna
get on the computer

79
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,561
and see if any of
the sheriff's deputies

80
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,430
can snatch him up
in some courtroom.

81
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,066
Yeah.

82
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,518
No, no, no,
we got Ronnie Mo.

83
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,322
Yeah, I'm lookin' at him
go in the jail van right now.

84
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,324
All right.

85
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,911
Fished our limit.
Let's go home.

86
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,696
Sir.

87
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:06,365
Huh?

88
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:07,816
Let's go home, sir.

89
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:10,285
You're looking at
a soon-to-be-made sergeant,

90
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,154
so what I'm saying is,
when we're around the troops,

91
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,507
you gotta get used to
showing the proper respect.

92
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,876
So, let's go home, sir.

93
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:19,878
All right?

94
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,478
What's the count?

95
00:06:36,513 --> 00:06:41,049
So far we've picked up 12,
leaves seven on the wing.

96
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,519
Anything worthwhile?

97
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,187
Some phone numbers
that match,

98
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,989
scraps of nicknames,
not much else.

99
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:49,357
We need something now.

100
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,209
<i>They're gonna shut us down</i>
<i>unless we come up</i>

101
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,361
<i>with something fresh</i>
<i>to run with right now.</i>

102
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,529
The wires are dead.

103
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,415
The bug on the club
is useless.

104
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,417
They were moving out of there
even as we got up on them.

105
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:01,086
- To where?
- No clue.

106
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:03,204
But they're gonna
have to set up again.

107
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,057
Either Barksdale moves
to reset his distribution

108
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,375
or he gives up
the towers.

109
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,844
If not Avon,
then Stringer.

110
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,512
And why not Avon?

111
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,881
With no priors,
he's out two hours
after the bail review.

112
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,401
Shit, what we put on Barksdale
barely makes him break stride.

113
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,770
Okay, so, we get a hint of
where they're setting back up,

114
00:07:18,822 --> 00:07:20,939
we ask the state's attorney
for a new bug,

115
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:22,741
maybe even a wire
if we get onto a phone.

116
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,493
Not while
the deputy breathes air.

117
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,195
<i>We'll be reassigned</i>
<i>before you finish typing</i>
<i>up your affidavit.</i>

118
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,914
How about the feds?

119
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,083
You think the deputy's
gonna let you take
this mess federal?

120
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,169
Why does the deputy
need to know?

121
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,122
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

122
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:39,925
McNulty, you are
a piece of work.

123
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,428
Yeah. McNulty.

124
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:46,598
Yeah?

125
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:51,553
No shit.

126
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,857
No fucking shit.

127
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,726
It's Rhonda Pearlman,

128
00:07:57,761 --> 00:08:00,479
She just got a call from
an assistant public defender

129
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:02,197
in North Jersey,
who claims to represent

130
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,566
a man by the name of
D'Angelo Barksdale.

131
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:07,452
Yeah, meet me in homicide.
Bring a tape recorder.

132
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,871
No drug lawyers?
No Levy?

133
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:15,410
- Case got some legs
on her, don't she?
- Don't she?

134
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:17,412
Shit, a quarter of
a million dollars bail.

135
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:19,280
You believe
that shit?

136
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,916
Right, it hurts to even
show that kinda money.

137
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:23,451
Yeah. Where Levy at?
He ain't at the club,
is he?

138
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,953
Oh, hell, no,
club's out.

139
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,838
We can't talk
there no more.

140
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,124
C'mon, man,
let get out of here.

141
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,143
What's up, baby?

142
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:36,982
So, this is it, huh?

143
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,466
Look, before you
go anyplace else,

144
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,068
before you talk
anyplace else,

145
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,988
we gotta think
this through.

146
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,540
We're up to almost
20 arrests at last count.

147
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:47,776
And if you look
at the probable cause,

148
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:49,544
they all read
just like yours,

149
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,780
information from
a confidential source.

150
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:53,999
Don't this seem way
too much for one snitch?

151
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,867
Oh, I agree.

152
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,586
My gut tells me
a wire.

153
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,538
Either on
a phone or two,

154
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,041
or maybe something
in a room somewhere.

155
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:05,010
You talk to your nephew
on the phone about
the Jersey thing?

156
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,012
Naw, 'course not, man,
no phones.

157
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,830
When I talk to him,
I talk to him face-to-face

158
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,133
in my office
in the back of the club.

159
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:13,385
Fuck.

160
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:15,370
It's good you
moved out of there.

161
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:17,472
I don't know, man.
I mean, if they got
a mike up in there,

162
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:19,841
they got you and me sayin'
all kind of shit, man.

163
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,644
Oh, that reminds me.

164
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,846
<i>He said he'd</i>
<i>be in tonight.</i>

165
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:28,199
Thing is, they take
you and leave me?

166
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,068
Yeah, that's what's
fuckin' me up, too, man.

167
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,453
Look, we'll know
soon enough,

168
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,121
as soon as I start
pressing for discovery.

169
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,623
In the meantime,
what do you wanna do

170
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,041
about the people
they locked up?

171
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,742
We gotta pull 'em.

172
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,377
That's showing
a lot of money.

173
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,796
Well, if we don't,
we run the risk of
makin' them enemies.

174
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,699
Speaking of which,
where are you with
your nephew?

175
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,835
Is he gonna see
the light or what?

176
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,254
Let me tell you
something, man.
He family, a'ight?

177
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:51,039
He not gonna buck.

178
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,008
A day or two
in a New Jersey bullpen,

179
00:09:53,043 --> 00:09:55,977
he gonna be cryin',
waitin' for bail money,
like the rest of 'em.

180
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,596
All right.

181
00:09:57,648 --> 00:10:00,348
So, let's run the money
through the families,

182
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:01,683
that'll hide it some.

183
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:03,735
And don't use
the same bondsman.

184
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:04,986
All right.

185
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,404
Now, look, gentlemen,
I know it's early,

186
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,406
but I want you
to start thinking
about who was charged

187
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,358
and what kind of time
they can do.

188
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:12,694
One of the ways
to limit your exposure

189
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:14,496
is what's called
a structured plea.

190
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,565
That means that you're gonna
have to deliver your people,

191
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,201
all of them,
down to a man.

192
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:23,538
I saw your girl today
for the idents.

193
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:26,341
How's she doin'?

194
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,143
Okay, I guess.

195
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:30,762
She's out
of the ICU.

196
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,931
Movin' slow,
but movin', you know?

197
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,633
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

198
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:38,019
Jimmy, you ain't
been to see her?

199
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,521
No, I couldn't go in.

200
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,940
This ain't
about you, right?

201
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:45,694
I get back
from Jersey, I will.

202
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:51,366
I will.

203
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,236
You know, Cole and me,
we showed her the spreads.

204
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:57,372
Picked out Little Man
no problem.

205
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,208
Wouldn't go for Wee-Bey,
so I tried the fat finger.

206
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,460
<i>Damn near</i>
<i>down on my knees,</i>

207
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,045
begging her to make
this play easier in court.

208
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,847
You know
what she said?

209
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:08,683
"Sometimes things
gotta play hard."

210
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:11,169
(laughs)

211
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:13,972
- Real police.
- Oh, yeah.

212
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,100
What the fuck
did you do to her?

213
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:27,018
I don't know.

214
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,187
You two
in the same car

215
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:31,356
gonna make for a long-ass
drive to Jersey.

216
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:33,608
Shit.

217
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,711
Is this mahogany?

218
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:55,513
<i>This is a mahogany</i>
<i>front, sir.</i>

219
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,183
<i>(organ music playing)</i>

220
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:15,116
Damn, man, it's just--
it's too still in here.

221
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,824
(children shouting)

222
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:26,628
Slow down.
Slow down some.

223
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,549
You know what?

224
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,001
We can--

225
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,173
This place'll
be fine.

226
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,041
All we really
gotta do, man,

227
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,593
is put a little safe
in here someplace

228
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:43,812
and let 'em know the count
comes here from now on.

229
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,897
-<i> Period.</i>
-<i> All right.</i>

230
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,984
Damn, boy, when y'all
change up, y'all--

231
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,653
Shh.

232
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,154
Y'all that
paranoid?

233
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,073
You ain't even been
up in there before.

234
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,275
I'm tellin' you, sis,
this shit is different.

235
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:59,244
We are not gonna talk
about nothing indoors.

236
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,745
It's a new day.

237
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,231
Thing is, man, we gotta
get back on our feet.

238
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,666
You know what
I'm talking about?

239
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,067
I mean, the longer
we hold off,

240
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,502
the harder it's gonna be for
us to maintain them towers.

241
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,003
You want
to get it back up,

242
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,955
you lean to me
and String here.

243
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:12,423
No, I ain't down yet.

244
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,175
-<i> You need to step back.</i>
-<i> She's right, bro.</i>

245
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,177
You can't take
a second chance here,

246
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,912
you know
what I'm saying?

247
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,415
Until you fixed,
sis gonna handle that money,

248
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,966
I'm gonna handle
that products.

249
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:24,102
- We here for you.
- A'ight.

250
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,721
But you tell Roberto,

251
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:28,589
he gotta make it
a serious smoker.

252
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,608
I mean, I want them
motherfuckin' fiends
in the projects,

253
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,061
I want them droppin'
like flies. You feel me?

254
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:34,813
You send out the word,

255
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:36,681
you let 'em know
we ain't dead yet.

256
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:39,818
What about my nephew?

257
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,653
Don't fret.

258
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:43,655
Give me a chance
to get with Roberto,

259
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:47,158
then I'll get up to Dee,
do what needs doing.

260
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,743
Tell him,

261
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:50,945
I'm sorry for puttin' him
out there like that.

262
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,631
And that I'm gonna
make it up to him.

263
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,917
Oh, you gonna
make it up.

264
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:58,386
Mos def.

265
00:14:03,894 --> 00:14:06,311
Woman:
<i>But again, I want</i>
<i>to make it clear</i>

266
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,247
<i>that all of this cooperation</i>
<i>is contingent on a commitment</i>

267
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,482
<i>that my client</i>
<i>finds acceptable.</i>

268
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,102
Failing that,
everything said in here

269
00:14:14,137 --> 00:14:16,404
- stays in here.
- Damn straight.

270
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,989
I'm sure
a proffer in Maryland

271
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,657
plays much the same
in Jersey, counselor.

272
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,026
And I do agree that
with regard to matters

273
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,812
involving drug trafficking,
your client has been helpful.

274
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,165
He's indicated
a willingness to testify

275
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,833
<i>that he was</i>
<i>a lieutenant</i>

276
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,920
<i>in Avon Barksdale's</i>
<i>drug distribution</i>
<i>organization,</i>

277
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,539
sold large quantities
of drugs for his uncle,

278
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:37,542
delivered money, attended
organizational meetings,

279
00:14:37,594 --> 00:14:39,327
<i>and on one occasion,</i>

280
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,546
<i>made a trip to New York</i>
<i>on the behest of his uncle.</i>

281
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:44,682
All of which corroborates
much of what we already know.

282
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,835
Well, what else
is there?

283
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:49,854
The murders.

284
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,274
Man, why you
keep on that, huh?

285
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,893
I already told you,

286
00:14:54,945 --> 00:14:57,028
I don't know nothin' about
that witness bein' killed.

287
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,380
Which witness?

288
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,983
Remember her?

289
00:15:02,018 --> 00:15:05,019
Jesus.

290
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,537
They did her?

291
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,539
Yeah, about the same time
they did the boy.

292
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:20,051
All them bodies.

293
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,757
They coverin' up, man.

294
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:27,425
Yeah, that's
what we think.

295
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:28,726
No loose ends.

296
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,178
I can understand
the guard.

297
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:33,547
She got paid,
so she had to go.

298
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,383
Orlando,
he knew too much,

299
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:36,985
got to snitchin',
so he had to go.

300
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,154
But then
there's the kid...

301
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,741
Wallace.

302
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,577
Man:
<i>But I need to go past</i>
<i>Argyle Street tonight.</i>

303
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,396
-<i> Check in with Wallace.</i>
- Woman:<i> Wallace?</i>

304
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,898
Man:
<i>He off the hook since</i>
<i>we helped the tower crew</i>

305
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,450
<i>get that stick-up boy.</i>

306
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:54,202
<i>I'm tellin' you, man,</i>
<i>Wallace is buggin'.</i>

307
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:56,537
<i>Don't hardly even come out</i>
<i>of that room no more.</i>

308
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:58,072
Woman:
<i>Why he be like that?</i>

309
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,707
Man:
<i>I'm thinkin' he might</i>
<i>be gettin' high.</i>

310
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:02,410
-<i> Wallace?</i>
-<i> The boy's scarin' me</i>
<i>with his shit.</i>

311
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,380
-<i> All right,</i>
<i>holler at me later.</i>
-<i> That'll work.</i>

312
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:06,464
<i>(dial tone)</i>

313
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:09,017
You got that shit
on tape?

314
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,052
Mm-hmm.

315
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,190
God!

316
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,976
Bunk:
<i>His name is</i>
<i>Brandon Wright.</i>

317
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:20,528
Burned him, broke fingers,
gouged an eye out.

318
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,696
All kinds of fun.

319
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,932
Dee:
<i>Wallace was</i>
<i>the one who saw.</i>

320
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,536
He saw the boy.

321
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,906
But he really ain't
think about what they'd do.

322
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:33,441
You must have known.

323
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,443
You were standing there
by that pay phone.

324
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,128
You knew.

325
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,329
What was
I gonna do, huh?

326
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:41,082
I don't call String,
the word get back uptown,

327
00:16:41,117 --> 00:16:42,467
what's gonna
happen then?

328
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,386
So, you told Wallace
to wait,

329
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,338
then you called Stringer,
and Stringer,

330
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,690
he gathered the troops.

331
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:50,558
Yeah.

332
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,126
And down
at the Greek's,

333
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,295
they got Wallace to point
the finger, right?

334
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,897
And then they went in
like cops with handcuffs,

335
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,315
so they could take
their time on Brandon.

336
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,485
They dropped the body
where we'd see it.

337
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,622
"Send a message
to the 'jects," they said.

338
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,691
Wallace...

339
00:17:06,743 --> 00:17:09,477
he couldn't
handle that.

340
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,413
After seeing that,
he wanted to get out.

341
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,699
Go back to school.

342
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:18,086
We even
joked about it,

343
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,254
him being 16 and all,

344
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,791
needin' to go start back
over again as a freshman.

345
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:26,327
And about a week ago,
my uncle and String,

346
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,513
they call me
down to the club.

347
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,215
Stringer, he's all worried
about Wallace and I told him.

348
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:34,085
I said, "Wallace
ain't no snitch."

349
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,488
Plus, he's out
the fucking game.

350
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,274
<i>I told him that.</i>

351
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,977
But I needed
to do more.

352
00:17:43,012 --> 00:17:45,813
I should've done more...

353
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,567
but I didn't, and...

354
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,352
fuck, that's on me.

355
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:55,239
Any idea who
they sent at Wallace?

356
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:00,495
C'mon, Dee,
wild guess.

357
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,581
Man, I don't know.
Could've been anybody.

358
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:05,299
You know,
shooters come cheap.

359
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,700
I don't think so.

360
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,803
Not in the pit.
Not in his crib.

361
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,139
<i>I counted seven beds</i>
<i>when I was up there.</i>

362
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,007
<i>Where were</i>
<i>the young'uns?</i>

363
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:16,544
Look, if I knew,
I would tell you.

364
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:20,314
A'ight, I swear to God,
I would tell you.

365
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:25,019
They've been
charged with Orlando
and the undercover cop,

366
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:28,022
but we're
still hunting.

367
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,828
Him, he in Philly.

368
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,397
How you know?

369
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,832
I know 'cause
I dropped him there.

370
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,334
- Where?
- I don't know.
Some corner, man.

371
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,069
Northend, I don't know
where he be stayin'.

372
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,872
Did Wee-Bey say anything
to you about the shootings?

373
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:47,575
We don't talk shop
in a car.

374
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,460
It's a rule we got.

375
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,481
So, is that it?

376
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:57,268
Your client must realize
that any agreement

377
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,971
is dependent
on his full cooperation.

378
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:02,723
Well, yo,
there ain't nothin' else.

379
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,466
Deidre.

380
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:16,204
(knocks)

381
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,073
Tap, tap, tap.

382
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:21,993
(knocks)

383
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,914
She was one of
my uncle's girls.

384
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:29,634
Yeah, but we got people
who put you with her
the night she's killed.

385
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,220
Yeah, I didn't know
they was gonna do her.

386
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:35,006
I swear.
They played me.

387
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,008
How so?

388
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,630
My uncle gave me
an eight ball of coke.

389
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:45,683
Told me to take it
over there to her.

390
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:48,186
I was surprised,
'cause, you know,

391
00:19:48,238 --> 00:19:49,803
I thought
he dumped her.

392
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,272
But he said, naw,
it wasn't like that
no more.

393
00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:54,158
So, he had Wee-Bey
take me over there.

394
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,944
You know, I walked up,
knocked on the door,

395
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:58,963
<i>she came to the door</i>
<i>all naked and shit</i>

396
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,865
<i>with this</i>
<i>little-ass robe on.</i>

397
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:02,166
So, she's your
uncle's girl,

398
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,818
but she comes to
the door for you naked?

399
00:20:03,853 --> 00:20:06,037
She used to do that shit
with me all the time, man.

400
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:08,706
Teasin'.
You know how girls do.

401
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:11,726
- Maybe you don't.
-<i> (McNulty laughs)</i>

402
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,544
I don't know.

403
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:17,682
Anyway, I'm like,
"Ain't you gonna
let me come in?"

404
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,051
She's like, naw,
because she gotta get ready

405
00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:21,852
for my uncle
to come by later.

406
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,388
So, I give her
the coke.

407
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,807
She laughs about how
she's gonna put that shit

408
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:28,893
on ice
for later on.

409
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:32,046
- Refrigerator.
- Uh-huh.

410
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:34,014
I don't know shit
about no refrigerator.

411
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,983
Like I said,
I didn't go in.

412
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:38,819
So, I turned around,
started walkin' back
to the truck,

413
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:40,288
and I heard
this shot.

414
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,022
Wee-Bey,
he come runnin' back

415
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,041
with this big-ass .45
he like to use so much.

416
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,628
<i>Tells me how he was tappin'</i>
<i>on the window real soft.</i>

417
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,730
How with the lights on,
she had to walk all the way up,

418
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:52,383
'cause she couldn't see
what was on the outside.

419
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:56,203
And when she gets up
to the window and looks out...

420
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,264
You did good,
D'Angelo.

421
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:08,816
Yeah, you did.

422
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,967
Y'all don't
understand, man.

423
00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:29,453
<i>Y'all don't get it.</i>

424
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:32,373
You grow up
in this shit.

425
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:36,711
My grandfather
was Butch Stamford.

426
00:21:36,746 --> 00:21:39,046
<i>You know</i>
<i>who Butch Stamford</i>
<i>was in this town?</i>

427
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:41,265
Mm-hmm.

428
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,551
All my people, man,

429
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:46,854
my father, my uncles,
my cousins.

430
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:50,391
It's just
what we do.

431
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:55,896
You just live
with this shit

432
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:58,949
until you can't
breathe no more.

433
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,036
I swear to God,

434
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,206
I was courtside
for eight months

435
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:10,211
and I was freer in jail
than I was at home.

436
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:14,148
What are you
looking for?

437
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:19,286
- I want it to go away.
- I can't...

438
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:22,256
I want what
Wallace wanted.

439
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,392
I want
to start over.

440
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,427
That's what I want.

441
00:22:26,462 --> 00:22:28,429
I don't care where.
Anywhere.

442
00:22:28,464 --> 00:22:30,264
<i>I don't give a fuck.</i>

443
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,816
<i>I just want</i>
<i>to go somewhere</i>

444
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,852
where I can breathe
like regular folk.

445
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,855
You give me that...

446
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,909
and I'll give
you them.

447
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,366
No, that's great.

448
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:50,034
Really great.

449
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,336
Yeah.

450
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:55,873
That's our move.

451
00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:57,842
Mm-hmm.

452
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:03,130
<i>Okay.</i>

453
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:13,891
We broke it open
tonight.

454
00:23:13,943 --> 00:23:15,609
Wide open.

455
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,028
I'm bringing
this case in big.

456
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:24,702
So, this squares things
with Burrell, right?

457
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,875
To hell with the man.

458
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,411
But I think we might have
enough to reach out to the feds,

459
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:35,362
try to run this thing
through them.

460
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,497
Cedric.

461
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:38,466
He knows about
the money, Marla.

462
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,701
<i>He's known</i>
<i>for a long while.</i>

463
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,870
<i>Fact is, I wouldn't</i>
<i>be surprised</i>

464
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:45,306
if it's why he picked me
for this case.

465
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,208
Well, what does he--

466
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,977
what are you gonna--

467
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,479
<i>He's got me</i>
<i>if he wants me.</i>

468
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,481
<i>Thing is, I don't</i>
<i>think he wants me.</i>

469
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,483
Too much stink,

470
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:58,285
too much mess.

471
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,493
Kinda like this case.

472
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:12,082
I have to admit it, Jimmy,
this is a great case.

473
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,400
I mean, not just
because of Greggs,

474
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,369
because it goes to that
and answers that,

475
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:18,005
but because--
because of how deep it goes.

476
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,908
I mean, the murders,
the money--

477
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:23,577
<i>Jesus, I feel like</i>
<i>I've been drunk</i>

478
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:25,379
<i>ever since that kid</i>
<i>starting talking to us.</i>

479
00:24:25,414 --> 00:24:27,298
You okay to drive?

480
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,799
I can drop you home
and you can pick up
your car tomorrow.

481
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:31,084
No, I'm good.
I'm good.

482
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:34,805
I'm great.
This was fucking great!

483
00:24:34,857 --> 00:24:37,708
You want to try
to go federal with this?

484
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,393
I am up for it.

485
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:41,162
I get cross-designated
as an AUSA

486
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:44,532
and we can really
run with it, you know?

487
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:49,203
Career fucking case.

488
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,577
Anyway...

489
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,801
Ronnie.

490
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,136
The thing at, um...

491
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,288
Levy's the other day,

492
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:11,091
I was, uh-- I was--

493
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,852
Jesus, Ronnie,
not here.

494
00:25:21,904 --> 00:25:23,470
What are you doing?

495
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:26,774
Like you never did it
in the headquarters
garage before?

496
00:25:28,411 --> 00:25:30,744
(laughing)

497
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:39,787
<i>(tires screeching)</i>

498
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:47,011
Jesus,
Mary and Joseph.

499
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,513
Look what just walked in
without a fucking escort.

500
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,549
Downtown Roy Brown.

501
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:54,802
The living legend
in his own mind.

502
00:25:56,272 --> 00:25:58,556
Uptown Lester Freamon.

503
00:25:58,608 --> 00:26:01,025
Fuck me,
how long's it been?

504
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,310
Your retirement party,
wasn't it?

505
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:05,229
And this is
retirement, huh?

506
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:07,481
Yeah.
Nice fuckin' digs, huh?

507
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:10,517
Ask my supervisor when
I'll see a little sunlight.

508
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:14,204
Runt cocksucker says,
"when your unit
turns a profit."

509
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,859
But enough of my joy,
what do you guys need?

510
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:21,412
We need a trap
and trace.

511
00:26:21,464 --> 00:26:23,196
But not in Maryland.

512
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,132
Pennsylvania, Philly.

513
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,501
You gotta
go through them.

514
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:28,552
No, we try that,
we lose a week,

515
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,037
them tellin' us
it can't be done,

516
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:32,056
then another week
for their attorneys
to okay our subpoena.

517
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,424
Plus, it's a little
more complicated

518
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:35,175
than just
a straight-up trace.

519
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:37,210
We actually need a list
of phones in Philly

520
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,979
that called this number
in the past week.

521
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:41,815
Well, what's the number?

522
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,901
Drug lawyer,
downtown office.

523
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:47,321
Thought billing be
the place to look.

524
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:50,608
Well, if we could do it,
and I'm not sayin' we can,

525
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,895
it's gonna be
a fuckin' week,
maybe two.

526
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:57,164
Thanks, Roy.

527
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,584
Hey, Lester, isn't this
supposed to be the time

528
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,153
you tell me how
all-fired fuckin'
important this is?

529
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:12,046
The Philly number
gives us the mope

530
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:14,632
who shot that
female undercover.

531
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,756
McNulty:
<i>I'm tellin' you, Fitz,</i>
<i>it's the perfect case.</i>

532
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:25,109
- You'll love it.
- Well, it sounds great.

533
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,527
But like I said,
Jimmy,

534
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,729
we're not fishing
for drug cases anymore.

535
00:27:28,764 --> 00:27:30,564
Try DEA.

536
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:33,266
No, that field office
is too close to our CID.

537
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,536
We go there, our bosses
know it before a meeting
is scheduled.

538
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,305
Your bosses don't know
you're doing this?

539
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,660
Who'll be coming?

540
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:45,946
Me, a detective name
of Freamon and Daniels.

541
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:47,748
I can speak
for Daniels, brother.

542
00:27:47,783 --> 00:27:50,634
He's played this thing
out with real heart.

543
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,638
C'mon,
set something up.

544
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:58,175
All right.

545
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:04,181
<i>(door opening)</i>

546
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,937
Could I get
10 copies?

547
00:28:09,972 --> 00:28:11,405
10 copies?

548
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,524
10, right.

549
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,496
<i>(machine beeping)</i>

550
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:25,318
No problems?

551
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:26,754
No.

552
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,789
Money?

553
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:37,881
All right, man,
I'll get at you.

554
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,357
<i>Yo, you locked</i>
<i>that door, right?</i>

555
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:50,144
Yeah?
Alright, so, listen.

556
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:51,845
It's not street-ready,
all right?

557
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:54,181
<i>So, everybody</i>
<i>gotta work on their</i>
<i>own cut and vial up.</i>

558
00:28:54,216 --> 00:28:57,735
Now, listen to me,
tell 'em to get
this straight.

559
00:28:59,021 --> 00:29:01,071
Three parts
of this, all right?

560
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:03,574
To one of raw,
alright?

561
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:06,660
<i>And that's how we gonna do</i>
<i>until we get the new stash.</i>

562
00:29:06,695 --> 00:29:08,262
And I want you to put
the word out there

563
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:10,297
that we back up.

564
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:13,233
Understand me?
We back up.

565
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:15,302
It's a good target.

566
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,421
You guys have
a pretty good case here.

567
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,339
Look at
the violence alone.

568
00:29:19,374 --> 00:29:22,342
It's at least a dozen murders,
including state's witnesses.

569
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,928
If you can help us
squeeze the Barksdale kid

570
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,396
into a witness
protection program,

571
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,182
we can run wild
with this thing.

572
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:29,549
No suppliers though.

573
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,652
We're still looking
for a way into that.

574
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,721
There was nothing on the wire
that took us toward New York.

575
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,356
The trouble is,

576
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:39,159
we have these post
911 protocols.

577
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,745
We can't pick up
any new narcotics work

578
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,948
unless it goes to priority
organized-crime targets.

579
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,084
<i>Meaning Cosa Nostra</i>
<i>or Colombians.</i>

580
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,702
Or Russians maybe.

581
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:50,871
Well, we don't have any
Colombians in Baltimore.

582
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:52,506
Yeah, we don't
have any wiseguys.

583
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,241
All we got is
a whole lot of locals

584
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,876
a little busy tearing
the Westside apart.

585
00:29:55,911 --> 00:29:58,762
I hear you,
but the bureau-wide
protocol applies.

586
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,382
To run with you on this,
we need a recognized
OC target,

587
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:05,469
or even better, a connect
to counterterrorism
or corruption.

588
00:30:05,521 --> 00:30:07,221
<i>You go near stuff</i>
<i>like that,</i>

589
00:30:07,256 --> 00:30:09,389
we have something
we can bring to our ASAC.

590
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:11,424
What kind
of corruption?

591
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:14,812
Don't know,
what kind you got?

592
00:30:17,032 --> 00:30:18,232
<i>(rap music playing)</i>

594
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,402
Where Roc-Roc at
with the shit?

595
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:24,955

Some shit they call
yellow tops.

<i>Yellow tops.</i>

Yellow tops. Yellow tops.
Got them yellow tops.

604
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,263

Huh?!
Fuck is y'all doin'?

606

Yo, do what you feel.

607
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,852
But be ready to finish
what you start.

608
00:30:54,904 --> 00:30:57,604
What is you doin'?
This ain't no open market,
you know that.

609
00:30:57,639 --> 00:30:59,189
Ain't no market
at all, nigga.

610
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:00,490
You ain't got
shit to sell.

611
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:01,775
Back that ass up
for those that do.

612
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,277
- You know what?
- What?!

613
00:31:03,312 --> 00:31:05,996
Fuck you.

out of here, bitch!

614

Why not?

00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,457
Bad as any civilian.

00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:02,169
With the case, fool.

628
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:05,705
<i>Jesus,</i>
<i>give it a rest.</i>

629
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,691
What's on the wire?

630
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,197
- Come on, man.
-<i> Wire's dead.</i>

631
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:17,551
They changed up after
we hit 'em with raids.

632
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:19,486
Daniels didn't tell you?

633
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,072
Hell, no.

634
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:25,092
He only talks to me
about the good shit.

635
00:32:25,127 --> 00:32:28,578
<i>About how y'all were onto</i>
<i>my shooters and stuff.</i>

636
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,415
Yeah, well, yeah,
we lost the wire,

637
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,417
but the good news
is D'Angelo's flipped

638
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,619
and we're talking
to the feds about maybe--

639
00:32:35,671 --> 00:32:38,255
Fuck both y'all.

640
00:32:43,012 --> 00:32:45,262
She wants me to quit.

641
00:32:47,116 --> 00:32:49,549
Says there ain't
nothing worth this.

642
00:32:49,585 --> 00:32:52,853
<i>So, I promised her</i>
<i>I'd think about it.</i>

643
00:32:54,757 --> 00:32:56,690
Well, what do you say?

644
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,361
I don't know.

645
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:05,732
I guess you should do
what you need to.

646
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:09,786
But she's right...

647
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,539
it isn't worth it.

648
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:16,977
No?

649
00:33:18,147 --> 00:33:19,379
Yeah.

650
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,848
Probably not.

651
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,591
Anyway, what took you
so long getting up in here?

652
00:33:31,627 --> 00:33:35,896
Shit, no cards,
no flowers.

653
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,231
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>what the fuck, Jimmy?</i>

654
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,734
I couldn't.
I, uh...

655
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,904
I felt, uh...

656
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:47,657
a case like this,
it's always you or Sydnor

657
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:51,411
or some other black cop
who ends up going undercover.

658
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:59,703
I swear, if I could
do it over...

659
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:04,858
if I...

660
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:08,095
If<i> I</i> could
do it over,

661
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,064
you know
what I'd do?

662
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:17,137
Put more tape
on that fucking gun.

663
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:22,059
I'm sorry, Kima.

664
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,896
I'm sorry.

665
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:31,485
Anyway, since
I got you up in here

666
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,537
acting like
my bitch and shit,

667
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:37,407
with all your guilty-ass
cryin' and whatnot...

668
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,729
maybe you can
do something for me.

669
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:45,365
She said you were
doin' good.

670
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:47,467
Said she was
proud of you.

671
00:34:49,204 --> 00:34:51,871
How she doin'?

672
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,674
Still shook.

673
00:34:56,044 --> 00:34:57,561
But she wanted you
to have that.

674
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:01,098
And told me
to tell you she's sorry
to be late with it.

675
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,650
Girl got such heart,
you know?

676
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,353
Yeah.

677
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:11,775
This is enough for what
I got goin' now, man.

678
00:35:11,827 --> 00:35:15,162
You, uh, you give
the rest back to her.

679
00:35:16,565 --> 00:35:18,365
Are you sure?

680
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,543
Give her my love.

681
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:31,795
Right.

682
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:36,183
Hey,<i> McNutty.</i>

683
00:35:39,754 --> 00:35:42,305
Don't tell her.

684
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,399
- What you got, man?
- Over there, man.

685
00:35:52,434 --> 00:35:54,434
UN-fucking-believable.

686
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:56,036
Five guys got jumped.

687
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,287
Not just you.

688
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,156
Four other guys
jumped me.

689
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,607
I'm sorry, man.

690
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:03,460
It's gotta be all
the brutality complaints.

691
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,495
Which means it ain't
never gonna matter

692
00:36:05,547 --> 00:36:06,946
how well I do on
no fucking test.

693
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:08,615
You don't know that.

694
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:10,050
You might make
the next list, you know?

695
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,052
You don't know.

696
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:15,255
Guess I ain't
leadership material.

697
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,840
Well, congratulations, Carv.

698
00:36:16,892 --> 00:36:18,592
Thanks.

699
00:36:18,627 --> 00:36:20,126
(phone ringing)

700
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,179
Yeah?

701
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:41,331
The world is
on its ass.

702
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,454
Guy called for you
from the phone company.

703
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,155
Says he's got
the number you wanted

704
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:50,757
for a house
in Philadelphia.

705
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,842
Beautiful,
thank you.

706
00:36:59,768 --> 00:37:01,351
Good casework.

707
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,802
Thank you.

708
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:04,137
I don't think
I'm giving anything away

709
00:37:04,172 --> 00:37:06,840
by telling that Arnold
here has had a file
on Senator Davis

710
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,008
for two
and a half years.

711
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:09,776
It took us
a while to see it,

712
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,728
but the quid-pro-quo
is right there

713
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,713
in that Westside
redevelopment mess.

714
00:37:13,749 --> 00:37:17,450
Barksdale or his fronts
grease enough city politicians

715
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:19,352
and word comes back
years in advance,

716
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,571
where the development
zone's gonna be.

717
00:37:21,623 --> 00:37:23,873
He buys up every piece
of garbage real estate he can,

718
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,493
flips it three or four times,
exaggerating the values.

719
00:37:26,528 --> 00:37:28,211
And now the city's gonna
pay him millions

720
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,630
to condemn the properties
for the renewal project.

721
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:33,300
It's a lot to work with,
but we're willing.

722
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,135
The question is,

723
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,087
can your cooperator
give us the senator?

724
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:38,955
Or any other
political figure?

725
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:42,058
- The cooperator?
- D'Angelo Barksdale.

726
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,394
What does he have
for us on the money?

727
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,684
Nothing.

728
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:52,819
He gives you the drugs
and the violence.

729
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,605
He gives you
Avon Barksdale.
Stringer Bell.

730
00:37:55,657 --> 00:37:57,440
And<i> they</i> give us
the senator.

731
00:37:57,476 --> 00:38:00,026
- Maybe, yeah.
-<i> Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

732
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:02,329
You're talking about
turning Barksdale and Bell
into cooperators

733
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,464
and making the politicians
the primary target?

734
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,065
Of course.

735
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,200
No, fuck
the politicians.

736
00:38:07,235 --> 00:38:08,952
Just Barksdale
and Bell.

737
00:38:09,004 --> 00:38:11,671
Those guys have
turned West Baltimore
into a free-fire zone.

738
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,606
No one's saying
they walk.

739
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:15,709
But what you are saying
is that if we bring you
guys the case,

740
00:38:15,744 --> 00:38:18,094
it's your intention
to let Barksdale and Bell

741
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,246
reduce any sentence
they get through
cooperation, huh?

742
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:21,748
Jesus Christ,
are you kidding?

743
00:38:21,783 --> 00:38:24,017
<i>You're seeing</i>
<i>all this ass-backwards.</i>

744
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,352
Detective,
in this office,

745
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,220
we have a mandate to pursue
political corruption.

746
00:38:27,255 --> 00:38:28,772
Can you believe
these guys?

747
00:38:28,857 --> 00:38:30,690
- Jimmy, look...
- What?

748
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,259
Drugs and murder don't
cut it anymore, huh?

749
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:35,195
Well, how 'bout
terrorism?

750
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,764
These guys have
dropped 14, 15 bodies.

751
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:39,282
The witnesses,
cooperators...

752
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:41,701
That kind of hyperbole doesn't
serve anyone, Detective.

753
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:54,681
I think we're going with
a different direction on this.

754
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:57,917
Thank you
for your time.

755
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:02,055
West Baltimore is dying
and you empty suits

756
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,475
are running around trying
to pin some politician's
pelt to the wall.

757
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:11,231
Thought you was
real police,<i> brother.</i>

758
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:29,115
<i>(chattering)</i>

759
00:39:36,591 --> 00:39:39,626
So, they got you
all the way out here, huh?

760
00:39:39,661 --> 00:39:42,295
<i>I started out thinkin'</i>
<i>you was in Jersey.</i>

761
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,681
<i>You ain't in Jersey,</i>

762
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,500
<i>I figure they still got you</i>
<i>down in central booking.</i>

763
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:51,271
All the way out here.

764
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,973
Do send a message though.

765
00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:56,709
Yeah, well,
a message needs sending.

766
00:39:56,745 --> 00:39:59,763
How y'all
even find me?

767
00:40:01,516 --> 00:40:04,200
Ain't no one gonna keep
a mother from her son, right?

768
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:13,376
You know, he's always
talkin' family.

769
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:16,830
"Family is the heart,"
he say.

770
00:40:16,865 --> 00:40:21,084
Well, I'm family,
ain't I?

771
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:25,572
Well, what about me
for once?

772
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:28,725
It ain't right.

773
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,560
What's right?

774
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,095
Hmm?

775
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:35,064
You like for him
to step up,

776
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,834
take all the weight
and let you walk?

777
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,436
'Cause he will.

778
00:40:39,488 --> 00:40:41,187
You know he will.

779
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:43,723
But if he gotta
go away,

780
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:46,359
that mean you got to step
up and fill his shoes.

781
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:48,561
You ready for that?

782
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,897
Ma, you know
I ain't.

783
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,699
I ain't ready

784
00:40:52,734 --> 00:40:54,117
and I ain't never gonna
be ready for this game.

785
00:40:54,169 --> 00:40:55,785
Dee, come on.

786
00:40:55,837 --> 00:40:59,506
Look, they giving me
a chance to walk away,

787
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:02,342
<i>to start again</i>
<i>someplace else.</i>

788
00:41:03,845 --> 00:41:06,045
And what you
givin' them?

789
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,853
Look...

790
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,592
he messed up, Dee,
he knows it.

791
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:23,396
Now if you want to get even
with him, you can.

792
00:41:23,431 --> 00:41:26,900
But you hurt him,
you hurt this whole family.

793
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:28,401
All of us.

794
00:41:28,436 --> 00:41:30,937
<i>Me and Trina</i>
<i>and the cousins.</i>

795
00:41:30,972 --> 00:41:32,572
<i>And Donette, too.</i>

796
00:41:32,607 --> 00:41:34,774
<i>And your baby.</i>

797
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:37,677
<i>Your own baby boy.</i>

798
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:40,663
This right here is
part of the game, Dee.

799
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:42,832
And without the game,

800
00:41:42,884 --> 00:41:45,134
this whole family would be
down in the fuckin' terrace,

801
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,452
livin' off scraps.

802
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,221
Shit, we probably
wouldn't even be a family.

803
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:52,258
Start over, huh?

804
00:41:52,294 --> 00:41:55,678
How the fuck you gonna start
over without your peoples,

805
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:59,232
without your
own child even?

806
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:05,271
You ain't got family
in this world,

807
00:42:05,306 --> 00:42:08,041
<i>what the hell</i>
<i>you got?</i>

808
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,277
(cocking gun)

809
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,497
This motherfucker
Wee-Bey twitches,

810
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,332
there won't even
be a trial.

811
00:42:18,253 --> 00:42:20,620
Detective Carver,

812
00:42:20,655 --> 00:42:22,255
a word?

813
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,548
Shut the door.

814
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:43,893
What's up, LT?

815
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,564
Anything you want
to tell me?

816
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:52,952
Been weeks now.

817
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:55,905
The deputy ops knows what's
going on in this unit

818
00:42:55,957 --> 00:42:58,541
almost before I do.

819
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,577
Except last week,

820
00:43:00,629 --> 00:43:03,195
we run the bug up into
Barksdale's club office

821
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:05,565
and Burrell,

822
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,151
for once,
he's a step behind.

823
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:11,387
<i>You see it?</i>

824
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:14,807
Maybe, he...

825
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,043
I see it.

826
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:20,563
I look around the office
and I see that one
of my people

827
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,582
is at the academy
for in-service.

828
00:43:26,488 --> 00:43:29,355
Lieutenant, I swear,
it wasn't my idea.

829
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:32,108
I mean, I'm minding
my business, doin'
my fuckin' job,

830
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,277
when the man calls
me upstairs for coffee
and a Danish, right?

831
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:37,730
<i>I mean, I never even</i>
<i>been on the eighth floor</i>
<i>of that fucking building.</i>

832
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:40,083
And there's
the deputy fucking ops

833
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,752
telling me how concerned
he is about the case,

834
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:45,872
how he needs
to be informed.

835
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,710
I mean, he's the deputy
fucking ops, man.

836
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,826
Couple weeks
from now,

837
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:08,645
you're gonna be in
some district somewhere

838
00:44:08,697 --> 00:44:12,332
with 11 or 12 uniforms
looking to you for everything.

839
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,435
And some of them
are gonna be good police.

840
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:19,205
Some of them are gonna
be young and stupid.

841
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,440
A few are gonna be
pieces of shit.

842
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:25,161
But all of them
will take their cue from you.

843
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:29,281
<i>You show loyalty,</i>
<i>they learn loyalty.</i>

844
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,784
You show them
it's about the work,
it'll be about the work.

845
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:34,053
You show them
some other kinda game,

846
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:35,888
then that's the game
they'll play.

847
00:44:45,967 --> 00:44:47,633
I came on
in the Eastern,

848
00:44:47,669 --> 00:44:51,304
<i>and there was</i>
<i>a piece-of-shit lieutenant</i>
<i>hoping to be a captain,</i>

849
00:44:51,339 --> 00:44:53,589
piece-of-shit sergeants
hoping to be lieutenants.

850
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:55,608
Pretty soon we had
piece-of-shit patrolmen

851
00:44:55,643 --> 00:44:57,143
trying to figure the job
for themselves.

852
00:44:57,162 --> 00:45:00,213
And some of
what happens then

853
00:45:00,248 --> 00:45:02,782
is hard as hell
to live down.

854
00:45:15,263 --> 00:45:17,597
Comes a day
you're gonna have to decide

855
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,500
whether it's about<i> you</i>
or about the work.

856
00:45:33,615 --> 00:45:35,982
Grand jury
came in Tuesday.

857
00:45:36,017 --> 00:45:38,951
But you knew that, right?

858
00:45:41,206 --> 00:45:43,406
We're working
a flight warrant today.

859
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:44,874
There's...

860
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:48,244
there's a lot
to do here in-office.

861
00:45:48,296 --> 00:45:50,963
I'd be careful
with that, though.

862
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:54,300
I understand the trigger
pull used to be light.

863
00:45:57,555 --> 00:46:00,339
<i>(helicopter hovering)</i>

864
00:46:13,488 --> 00:46:15,571
<i>(car alarm blaring)</i>

865
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,367
Keep him down.
Keep him down.

866
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,788
You got him?

867
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,339
Get him up there.
Get him up.

868
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:36,292
- Oh!
- Spread your legs.

869
00:46:36,344 --> 00:46:38,544
Bunch of
low-bottom bitches.

870
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:39,745
Get his wrists.

871
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:42,381
Y'all ain't have to
fuck with my ride.

872
00:46:47,355 --> 00:46:49,555
Motherfuckers
got lucky.

873
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,785
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

874
00:47:03,872 --> 00:47:05,488
Yeah?

875
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:12,879
Podunk lawyer in Denton's
giving the guards a hard time

876
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:15,381
about moving D'Angelo
from original jurisdiction.

877
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,251
Put the call through.

878
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,920
Okay.

879
00:47:21,956 --> 00:47:24,006
Officer Mace,
ASA Pearlman.

880
00:47:24,058 --> 00:47:27,059
You got a problem
with the lawyer?

881
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:32,014
Okay,
put the asshole on.

882
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:36,602
This is he.

883
00:47:39,908 --> 00:47:42,074
(knocks)

884
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,163
You do not
make it easy, Jimmy.

885
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,116
I have to admit,
I am deeply ambivalent.

886
00:47:50,151 --> 00:47:51,784
Excuse me?

887
00:47:51,819 --> 00:47:53,185
Sit.

888
00:47:53,221 --> 00:47:55,288
Sit!

889
00:47:57,325 --> 00:47:58,624
Here.

890
00:47:58,659 --> 00:48:00,376
I heard from Bunk.

891
00:48:00,428 --> 00:48:01,827
Philly.

892
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:03,329
Great work.

893
00:48:03,348 --> 00:48:05,381
You all did
great work.

894
00:48:05,433 --> 00:48:07,967
And the number of clearances
I'm looking at here,

895
00:48:08,002 --> 00:48:09,936
I mean, Christ,
for the first time
this year,

896
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,687
we got the clearance
rate up over 40%.

897
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:14,140
<i>That's on</i>
<i>the one hand.</i>

898
00:48:14,175 --> 00:48:16,976
On the other hand,
I know the deputy ops

899
00:48:17,011 --> 00:48:19,345
got a call from the first
deputy US attorney this morning

900
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:21,781
asking whether
an asshole such as yourself

901
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,849
<i>really works for us.</i>

902
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:27,153
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>this is the first the deputy</i>

903
00:48:27,188 --> 00:48:28,871
hears his troops are
creeping behind his back,

904
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:30,206
trying to take
a case federal

905
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,291
when they've already
been told the case is closed.

906
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:36,379
You're a good detective.

907
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:39,548
And I've got to admit
you got some stones on you.

908
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:42,969
Did you actually call
the first deputy an empty suit?

909
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:45,721
<i>(chuckling)</i>

910
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:50,092
I want to see you
land okay, Jimmy.

911
00:48:50,144 --> 00:48:54,513
So, tell me,
where don't you wanna go?

912
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:59,852
Levy:
<i>You all know as well as I do</i>
<i>that Baltimore City jurors</i>

913
00:48:59,887 --> 00:49:01,570
<i>are capable of</i>
<i>just about anything.</i>

914
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:04,223
Now, look, you want to sit
around for months on end,

915
00:49:04,258 --> 00:49:06,242
scratching our way through
a bunch of half-heard,

916
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:09,111
half-said telephone
conversations and see
how well you do,

917
00:49:09,163 --> 00:49:11,247
I'll certainly
respect the effort.

918
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,082
It's not just talk
on the wire.

919
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:15,368
We've got seized money
and a lot of dope on the table.

920
00:49:15,403 --> 00:49:16,585
And a lot
of violence.

921
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:18,904
All of which stops
way short of Mr. Barksdale.

922
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:20,206
You know this.

923
00:49:20,241 --> 00:49:22,074
All of it except
for the New Jersey bust.

924
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,626
That one he eats.

925
00:49:23,678 --> 00:49:25,544
Maybe he does.

926
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:29,198
<i>Maybe he pleads to one count</i>
<i>of attempted possession,</i>

927
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,600
and takes, I don't know,
maybe three, four.

928
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:35,054
Maybe he can arrange
for everyone you have

929
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:37,189
on those tapes
to follow suit.

930
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:39,358
Maybe you get five-year
pleas from those

931
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:41,060
with no prior
felony convictions,

932
00:49:41,095 --> 00:49:43,329
<i>10 years for those</i>
<i>with one prior,</i>

933
00:49:43,364 --> 00:49:44,964
15 for two or more.

934
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:46,449
What about
the murders?

935
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,068
Maybe we acknowledge
you've got Mr. Brice cold

936
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,870
for the murder
of Orlando Blocker

937
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:52,621
and the wounding
of the police officer.

938
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,874
- Who?
- Wee-Bey.

939
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,442
Representing Mr. Brice,

940
00:49:56,461 --> 00:49:59,362
I'm fairly confident that
to avoid the death penalty,

941
00:49:59,397 --> 00:50:03,416
he'll proffer to
at least a half dozen
of your open murders.

942
00:50:03,451 --> 00:50:06,669
Naming co-conspirators?
For that kind of cooperation,

943
00:50:06,721 --> 00:50:09,055
I'd be willing
to consider straight life.

944
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,223
No, indeed.
I believe Mr. Brice

945
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:13,309
is ready to take
sole responsibility

946
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,760
for all of his crimes.

947
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:18,230
Still, you walk away
with at least a half
dozen clearances.

948
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:19,815
Assets.

949
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:22,768
You take the strip club and
take whatever trucks and cars

950
00:50:22,803 --> 00:50:24,770
you can link
to the drug trafficking,

951
00:50:24,805 --> 00:50:26,238
and, of course,
whatever cash you've seized.

952
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:28,607
He's got dozens
of other properties.

953
00:50:28,642 --> 00:50:31,310
The funeral parlor,
the towing company.

954
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:33,496
No, no, you get the cars,
because you can tie them

955
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,031
to illegal activity,

956
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:36,949
but there's nothing else
in his name to take.

957
00:50:36,984 --> 00:50:39,001
So, you keep most of the money,
most of the real estate

958
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:40,753
and Stringer Bell
stays on the street

959
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,938
with his hand
on the throttle.

960
00:50:42,974 --> 00:50:45,925
If you have a charge
against Mr. Bell, file it.

961
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,344
Otherwise,
it's my understanding
that nothing

962
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:51,430
in all those hours of tape
implicates him.

963
00:50:55,353 --> 00:50:58,054
Three or four years
ain't enough, Maury.

964
00:50:58,106 --> 00:51:00,439
Not for
Avon Barksdale.

965
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:02,191
No?

966
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:06,879
Make an offer.

967
00:51:06,914 --> 00:51:08,481
Bailiff:
<i>Part 14 of the circuit court</i>

968

00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,069
First up.

971
00:51:13,121 --> 00:51:15,488
State versus
Avon Randolph Barksdale,
Your Honor.

972
00:51:15,523 --> 00:51:17,823
One count of possession
with intent to distribute,

973
00:51:17,858 --> 00:51:19,742
to wit,
a kilogram of heroin.

974
00:51:19,794 --> 00:51:21,377
<i>You have</i>
<i>a statement of facts?</i>

975
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,694
Yes, Your Honor.

976
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:24,363
Mr. Barksdale is offering
a plea of guilty

977
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:27,016
in exchange for a maximum
of seven years in DOC.

978
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:29,468
In consideration of the
following agreed-upon facts--

979
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:32,872
on or about the date
of September 17, 2002,

980
00:51:32,907 --> 00:51:35,007
<i>in the jurisdiction</i>
<i>of Essex County, New Jersey,</i>

981
00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:37,643
<i>Trooper Robert Warren</i>
<i>of the Newark Barracks</i>

982
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:40,479

<i>traveling southbound</i>
<i>near exit 13.</i>

984
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:45,067
<i>That traffic stop resulted</i>
<i>from information gleaned</i>

985
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:46,718
<i>from electronic surveillance</i>

986

<i>and his nephew,</i>
<i>D'Angelo Barksdale,</i>

987
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:51,190
<i>by detectives assigned</i>
<i>to a special detail</i>

988
00:51:51,225 --> 00:51:53,409
under the command of
a city narcotics supervisor.

989
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,995
<i>A search of the vehicle,</i>
<i>which was rented</i>

990
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,696
<i>from the Avis location</i>
<i>at BWI Airport,</i>

991
00:51:57,731 --> 00:51:59,615
<i>revealed that a kilogram</i>
<i>of nearly pure heroin</i>

992
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:02,618
<i>was concealed beneath</i>
<i>the spare tire in</i>
<i>the car trunk.</i>

993
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:04,286
<i>In accepting</i>
<i>this plea,</i>

994
00:52:04,338 --> 00:52:06,472
<i>Mr. Barksdale acknowledges</i>
<i>his role in procuring</i>

995
00:52:06,507 --> 00:52:08,257

<i>retail amounts of heroin...</i>

997
00:52:10,511 --> 00:52:13,579
Deidre Kresson,
Roland Leggett,
Toreen Boyd,

998
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:15,047
all tied
to the same gun.

999
00:52:15,082 --> 00:52:16,248
<i>Plus, we got</i>
<i>the stick-up boys,</i>

1000
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:19,218
<i>Brandon Wright,</i>
<i>John Bailey.</i>

1001
00:52:19,253 --> 00:52:20,853
With Orlando,
that makes six,

1002
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:22,921
plus the attempted
murder on a police.

1003
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,306
That it?

1004
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:26,442
I do better
if I give 'em more?

1005
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,394
Life, no parole
means what it says.

1006
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:30,429
This proffer keeps
you off death row,

1007
00:52:30,448 --> 00:52:32,281
but that's
all it does.

1008
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,033
You were on
the wrong side of a cop
getting shot, Mr. Brice.

1009
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:36,785
You want to even dream
about straight life
for all these bodies,

1010
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:39,288
you gotta wake up talking
about Avon Barksdale

1011
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,790
- and Stringer Bell.
- Nah.

1012
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:43,876
But as to murders,
you might as well give
them what you have,

1013
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:46,945
<i>because anything you leave</i>
<i>out is outside the deal.</i>

1014
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:49,665
If they learn about it later,
they can charge you later.

1015
00:52:49,717 --> 00:52:51,417
Fuck it then.

1016
00:52:51,452 --> 00:52:53,619
For another pit sandwich
and some 'tater salad,

1017
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:55,671
I'll go a few more.

1018
00:52:57,975 --> 00:53:01,343
- How you want that?
- Medium rare, a lot
of horseradish.

1019
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:08,517
All right,
I did Little Man.

1020
00:53:08,569 --> 00:53:11,070
Thinkin' he might get weak
on that cop gettin' shot.

1021
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,105
Yeah?
Where's the body?

1022
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,658
Druid Hill.
Behind the reptile house.

1023
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:17,409
You get back
in them weeds,

1024
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:18,944
you might could find
what's left of him.

1025
00:53:18,979 --> 00:53:21,614
All right,
that's seven.
What else you got?

1026
00:53:23,317 --> 00:53:25,834
How 'bout them
witnesses?

1027
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:29,705
The security lady
and what's-his-name,

1028
00:53:29,757 --> 00:53:31,707
the maintenance man.

1029
00:53:31,759 --> 00:53:33,759
Gant?

1030
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,427
Yeah, Gant.

1031
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:37,546
You did Gant, alone?

1032
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:44,553
They're out of 'tater salad,
how 'bout slaw?

1033
00:53:46,857 --> 00:53:49,225
Information gleaned
from electronic surveillance

1034
00:53:49,277 --> 00:53:53,011
would also show that
Mr. Watkins, AKA Ronnie Mo,

1035
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,231
<i>was integrally involved</i>
<i>in the distribution</i>

his pleading guilty
to one count of conspiracy,

1039
00:54:03,524 --> 00:54:07,076
<i>he agrees to a sentence not</i>
<i>to exceed 15 years in DOC.</i>

1040
00:54:07,128 --> 00:54:10,079
<i>Mr. Watkins,</i>

<i>a drug distribution charge</i>

1041
00:54:10,131 --> 00:54:13,632

<i>in Judge Prevas' court</i>
<i>in August 2001...</i>

1042
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,973
Cedric, hey.

1043
00:54:21,976 --> 00:54:24,009
Major Cantrell.

1044
00:54:24,979 --> 00:54:26,228
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

1045
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:27,346
So, where they
sending you?

1046
00:54:27,381 --> 00:54:29,398

You ever feel like
a change, give a yell.

1049

00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:26,158
Yo, Dink!

1096
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:33,081
- What the fuck was that?
- Huh?

1097
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,534
You take a nigga's money,
then you serve him?

1098
00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:37,669
<i>What the fuck?</i>

1099
00:57:41,742 --> 00:57:43,926
I'm sayin',
you take their money,

1100
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:46,712
then you send 'em
'round and let some
other nigga serve.

1101
00:57:46,747 --> 00:57:48,013
The way you doin' it,

1102
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:50,632
someone snappin' pictures
got the whole deal.

1103
00:57:50,684 --> 00:57:52,134
You hear?

1104
00:57:57,942 --> 00:58:00,559
We got to tighten up

1106
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:14,156
Hell of a case.

1107

1108

You done good, kiddo.

1110
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:33,959
Rhonda:
<i>D'Angelo Barksdale</i>
<i>supervised distribution</i>

1111
00:58:33,978 --> 00:58:36,645
<i>in the low-rise</i>
<i>courtyards and was also</i>
<i>integrally involved</i>

1112
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,897
<i>in the violence attributed</i>
<i>to the organization.</i>

1113
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:41,683
<i>Further, he was arrested</i>
<i>by authorities in New Jersey</i>

1114
00:58:41,735 --> 00:58:43,735
in possession
of a kilo of raw heroin

1115
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:45,771
intended for distribution
in Baltimore.

1116
00:58:45,806 --> 00:58:48,106
<i>He acknowledges his role</i>
<i>as a leading conspirator</i>

1117
00:58:48,141 --> 00:58:51,109
<i>and is already on parole</i>
<i>for two earlier counts</i>
<i>of distribution</i>

1118
00:58:51,144 --> 00:58:53,295
dating from
March 1999.

1119
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:54,696
What are you
asking here?

1120
00:58:54,748 --> 00:58:57,332
As Mr. Barksdale
has two prior convictions

1121
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:59,651
and is insisting that
the effort to purchase

1122
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,954
and transport the kilo was
undertaken on his own behest

1123
00:59:01,989 --> 00:59:05,156
<i>and is refusing</i>
<i>to cooperate against others,</i>

1124
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:06,959
<i>the state</i>
<i>is offering only</i>

1125
00:59:06,994 --> 00:59:09,294
<i>the maximum allowable</i>
<i>20 years, Your Honor.</i>

1126
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:11,663
Mr. Levy...

1127
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:14,016
this is your understanding
of the plea agreement?

1128
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,384
Yes, sir.

1129
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:16,969
<i>Very well then,</i>
<i>Mr. Barksdale.</i>

1130
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:18,554
<i>Can you hear me</i>
<i>distinctly?</i>

1131
00:59:18,606 --> 00:59:21,172
Dee:
<i>Yes.</i>

1132
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:24,142
- Wee-Bey, man.
- How'd it go?

1133
00:59:24,177 --> 00:59:27,863
For life, no-parole
he puts himself
in for Orlando

1134
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,648
and the attempt murder
on Greggs.

1135
00:59:29,683 --> 00:59:33,819
Then he also takes
Nakeisha Lyles,

1136
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:35,186
Deidre Kresson,

1137
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:37,522
the two project murders
that match that gun,

1138
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,258
both the stick-up boys,

1139
00:59:39,293 --> 00:59:42,077
- and Little Man.
- Little Man?

1140
00:59:42,129 --> 00:59:44,880
Yeah, body found
up behind the reptile
house in Druid Hill.

1141
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:48,383
He gave us that one
just for fun, I think.

1142
00:59:48,419 --> 00:59:50,969
He also takes
William Gant.

1143
00:59:52,306 --> 00:59:53,889
I know,
it's bullshit.

1144
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,223
Well, how'd he tell it?

1145
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:57,643
(sighs)
Man.

1146
00:59:58,812 --> 01:00:00,762
- Boom.
- He said a contact wound?

1147
01:00:00,814 --> 01:00:02,648
- Yeah.
- It doesn't play.

1148
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:05,100
Gant had no compression,
no stippling.

1149
01:00:05,152 --> 01:00:07,519
Wound was to the front.
Bey's talkin' out of his ass.

1150
01:00:07,554 --> 01:00:10,388
I know it, but this
motherfucker's just taking
murders just to take 'em.

1151
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:14,192
He's taking life,
no-parole for shooting
a cop, what the fuck?

1152
01:00:14,227 --> 01:00:16,194
Might as well
try to spring Bird
for killing Gant.

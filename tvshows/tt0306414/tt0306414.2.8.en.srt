Hi, we're not here,
leave a message.

00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,951
- ( recording beeps )
- Elena, you gotta
talk to me.

5
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:21,922
- ( bell rings )
- Bartender: Last call.

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,758
Last call.

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,395
( thumps )

8
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:30,464
Why is she such
a pain in the ass?

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,034
- McNulty: Excuse me.
- Hey, pal.

10
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:35,436
It's all right,
it's all right.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,771
One more, please.

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,773
( sighs )
Save some for the
rest of the customers,

13
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,675
- okay, Jimmy?
- Pour it!

14
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,914
You ain't gettin'
behind the wheel,
are ya?

15
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:48,782
There's a cab
pickin' me up.

16
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:53,721
I'm lookin' you
in the eye, Gus.

17
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:57,258
I'm tellin' you,
I'm not drivin'

Coffee.

What's with
the hand?

32
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,487
Just a scratch.

33
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,931
Give me some eggs
will ya?

34
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,867
Can I get scrapple
with that?

35
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,570
You can get
anything you want.

37
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:26,940
Oh, God.

Oh, oh, oh...!

00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:33,414
Oh, God, uh!

* Well, I beg
your pardon *

* At his command

have to worry *

( man yelling )

66
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,653
Look at him,
all high and mighty.

67
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,622
You ain't gonna let
that shit ride, are ya?

68
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,424
After what
he done did?

69
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,459
I'd truck his ass,
it was me.

70
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,027
He's built kinda
solid, though.

71
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,397
Maui ain't
all that.

72
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:06,199
It's the clothes
that give him size, Zig.

73
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,968
You think?

74
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,703
Ah, his ass
is candy, Zig.

75
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,640
You, you're a legend,
a legend of the docks.

76
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,409
Yo, truck him
with your best punch

77
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,713
and then just
walk the fuck away.

78
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,416
Officially, I've put us
on the hook for 14 open
homicides.

79
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,785
So either we bring in
a hell of a case,

80
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,088
or I'm as big a fool
as Colonel Rawls
thinks I am.

81
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,658
That sounded
a little desperate.

82
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:33,794
Not entirely.
Lester...

83
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,665
enlighten Ms. Pearlman
as to the status of our
investigation.

84
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:43,003
You said this case
needed a drug connect
for a wiretap, right?

85
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,005
Come take
a look at this.

86
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,144
That's the D.N.R. log
on the phone listed

87
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,314
to the warehouse where we
tracked the suspect container.

88
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,183
It shows outgoing
calls to numbers

89
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,818
that connect
to Petey Dixon,

90
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,420
"Proposition Joe" Stewart
and "White Mike" McArdle

91
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,422
among other
traffickers
on the Eastside.

92
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,424
Which supports
surveillance of
known dealers

93
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,426
coming and going from the
warehouse.

94
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:09,863
Also, some
surveillance shots
and matching mug shot photos

95
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,667
from Southeast D.E.U.
which tie White Mike
to street dealers

96
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,703
that we've already made
controlled buys from.

97
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,739
Assuming exhaustion,
that's one tap on
the warehouse phone.

98
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,340
What's your PC
on the truck driver?

99
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,709
Sergei Malatov,

100
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:24,612
resident alien,
Ukrainian origin.

101
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:26,246
No criminal
history here.

102
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,182
We ID'd him from the contract
on the D-A-C truck rental.

103
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,084
He was nice enough to give
the truck rental people

104
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,452
his cell phone number.

105
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,386
And, records of that
cell phone show a call

106
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,255
placed to the warehouse

107
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,659
at the time Kima
observed him on the docks,
using the cell phone.

108
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,262
Checking the D.N.R.
logs history, we matched
seven other calls

109
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:43,731
from that cell phone
to dates and times

110
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:46,266
when a container disappeared
from a Talco ship.

111
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,367
Anything else?

112
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,036
Tap two feels
a bit thin.

113
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,906
How about Nicholas
Sobotka of the 1400 block
of Reynolds Street?

114
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,047
On a C.I.'s information,
Herc and Carver followed him

115
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,082
from a drug meet along
the Fayette Street strip

116
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,652
back to his parents'
South Baltimore row home.

117
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:07,354
When we ran
that phone number
from that address

118
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:08,989
through the D.N.R.
at our warehouse,

119
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,423
we got nothing.

120
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,425
But, when we checked it
against the cell phone

121
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,227
of our friend,
Sergei...

122
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,428
we got a couple
a hits.

123
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:18,298
Sobotka's your
stated target, right?

124
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,634
This is a nephew,
and from the look of it,

125
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,236
he's involved
in street dealing
as much as smuggling.

126
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,772
But right now,
this case feels like

127
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,840
a lot more
than Frank Sobotka.

128
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,441
No offense
to Stan Valcheck.

129
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,443
Okay...

130
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,513
I admit,
you've got PC.

131
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:36,984
On the warehouse phone
and on the trucker's
cell phone, too.

132
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,252
Now...
what have you got
for exhaustion?

133
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,954
Any possible
informants?

134
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,255
Nothing on the docks.

135
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,557
No one we can
buy weight with.

136
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:44,792
Surveillance?

137
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,794
That got us
to the front door, but

138
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,696
it's not gonna get us
inside that warehouse.

139
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,965
Start typing.

140
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,702
I'll call the judge.

141
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,311
Ham and cheese sandwich and
one of them Frappuccino drinks.

142
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,217
Charles lost
a leg, I heard.

143
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,920
What?

144
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,089
"Frappucino"?

145
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,424
What the fuck
is that?

146
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,827
He all pussy, Zig.
Cold cock him.

147
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:23,330
Take 'em, Zig.
Now's the time.

148
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,602
Yeah, well,
he was talkin'...

149
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:37,144
Whaddaya know?
The pissant's got
some grapes on him.

150
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,578
Banana, too.

151
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,221
( grunts )

152
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,293
- Aw, fuckin' shit.
- ( laughing )

153
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,762
Aw, shit!

154
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:57,397
- Take us up.
- Ziggy: Son of a bitch.

155
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:00,200
God damn it.

156
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,469
Fuck you!

157
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,204
You big, stupid
fuckin' oaf.

158
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,472
Fuck you, Maui.

159
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,341
You, you're
a fuckin' wimp.

160
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,411
No, no,
fuck you, Maui!

161
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,446
( yells )

162
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,481
Stay there!

163
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,050
Fuck you!

164
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,020
( laughter, cheering )

165
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,425
God damn it!

166
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,260
Any of you fucks
try to help him down,

167
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,295
you'll be
up there with him.

168
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,031
Bad advice!

169
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:35,235
You motherfuckers
gave me bad advice!

170
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,637
Fuck you!

171
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,513
Aw, shit.

172
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,515
The hell
you wearing?

173
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:52,185
No one mentioned
all the perks.

174
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,520
Lacrosse?

175
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,189
What, a brother
can't run with a stick?

176
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,826
Jim Brown was
an All-American
midfielder at Syracuse.

177
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:01,461
You puttin' yourself
beside Jim Brown?

178
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,497
Uh, Lester, uh,
I'm just sayin'...

179
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,934
I thought you were
born in pinstripes.

180
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,236
Lieutenant, I was
under the impression

181
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,772
that when
detailed against his will
to some backwards-ass,

182
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,273
no 'count,
out-in-the-districts,

183
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,509
lost-ball-in-tall-grass
drug investigation,

184
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,311
a veteran police
of means and talent

185
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,513
can wear whatever the fuck
he damn well pleases.

186
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,682
Up to a point.

187
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,185
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

188
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,487
Well, it's a hell
of a thing to take
a downtown police

189
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:28,856
and lose him
in a crosstown world.

190
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:31,424
Take that one
over there.

191
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,226
( grumbles )
I'm homesick already.

192
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:36,529
- ( laughter )
- I don't know what
you're laughing at.

193
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,698
You can kiss my ass.

194
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,768
( laughter )

195
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,541
You should see
what your boy tried
to pull today.

196
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,544
- Fuckin' Ziggy.
- ( phone ringing )

197
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,680
What are ya
lookin' for?

198
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,182
Can't find
the fuckin' bills.

199
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,550
End of the month,
everything's hangin'.

200
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,319
We got anything
for the Greeks?

201
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,922
Wednesday, the Caspia
over at Patapsco.

202
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,490
Nicky'll go get
the slips tomorrow.

203
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,059
No wonder I couldn't
find 'em.

204
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,196
You use 'em
as bookmarks.

205
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,165
Ooh.

206
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,402
Let me ask you
something important.

207
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,740
You like fake tits?
I can't decide.

208
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:24,511
Thus far,
I'm undecided
on fake tits.

209
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,748
( loud squeaking )

210
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,119
I thought I knew
what paperwork was.

211
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,021
But what you all
go through to listen

212
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,455
to someone else's
phone calls...

213
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:38,325
( squeaking )

214
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,460
( squeaking stops )

215
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,402
( sighing )

216
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:58,011
You all cannot
spell for shit.

217
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,981
( chuckles )
Well, would we be
police if we could?

218
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,682
Who's the duty judge
this week?

219
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,018
- Vanderwal.
- You think he'll sign it?

220
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,454
No problem if you
clean his garage first.

221
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,422
Or wash
his windows, maybe.

222
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,325
( laughing )
Fuckin' Vanderwal.

223
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:15,929
- Wash windows?
- ( door closes )

224
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,565
Yeah.

225
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,539
Are these the affiants,
Ms. Pearlman?

226
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,976
Yes, Your Honor.

227
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,811
Are you willing to affirm
that the information offered

228
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,881
in this affidavit
is entirely true

229
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,482
to the best
of your knowledge?

230
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:36,749
( together )
Yes, Your Honor.

231
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,319
Yes, Your Honor.

232
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,820
Absolutely.

233
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,891
Upstairs, gentlemen.
Third floor, back bedroom.

234
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,093
Sash installation.

235
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,228
And then if you can
give the windows a wash.

236
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,297
Thank you.

237
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,534
Herc:
It's a good thing
I took the sergeant's test.

238
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,604
- Carver: Agh, my knees.
- Herc: Sorry, sorry.

239
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,372
- Woman on phone: First name?
- First name, Francis.

240
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,508
Woman:
Spell the last name
on the account.

241
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,112
S-O-B-O-T-K-A.

242
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:09,182
Yeah, that's it, yeah,
it's a business address.

243
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,318
- Woman: It's been flagged.
- Flagged?

244
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,786
It says right here
on the computer.

245
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,656
Yeah?
You're kidding me.
Huh.

246
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:21,128
- Woman:
Send in your payment...
- Whatever, okay.

247
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,829
Check's on
it's way tomorrow.

248
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,232
- Cross my heart.
- All right, Mr. Sobotka.

249
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,367
- Yeah.
- Take care, now.

250
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,741
Hey, Horse, if you
don't pay your phone bill
for three months,

251
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,344
- what happens?
- No phone.

252
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,546
Okay, so I'm like 90 days
late on my cell phone,

253
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:44,684
but they let me go,
even before I mail
the check in.

254
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,154
I ask the nice lady
in the billing department
why that is.

255
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,755
You know
what she tells me?

256
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,158
- I've been flagged.
- "Flagged"?

257
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,725
She says it's right there
on the computer screen

258
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:53,994
when my account
comes on,

259
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:57,564
"Do not disconnect
for non-payment."

260
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,166
"Flagged"?
What the fuck is that?

261
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,268
What am I,
special?

262
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:04,071
Maybe you been
touched by an angel.

263
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:10,910
Told you, B.

264
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,913
Tumbleweeds be blowin'
through this motherfucker.

265
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,516
Like the fiends all
cleaned theyselves up.

266
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,485
Naw, that
ain't it, man.

267
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,786
Word is out,

268
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:23,223
we just sellin' dog shit
up in here, man.

269
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,193
Damn.

270
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,301
Puddin'.

271
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:35,202
How we doin'?

272
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,971
Slow as a white man
in slippers.

273
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,341
All right, later.

274
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,343
Yo, man, we dyin'

275
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,545

some place else.

276
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,613
It's that
bullshit, man.

277
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,817
Hey, you two got
a reason to be here?

278
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,952
We're just goin'
about our business.

279
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,488
Keep moving.

280
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,159
Tsk.
Fake-ass police.

281
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,128
Where he get that
uniform at, K-Mart?

282
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,329
He wouldn't be
all chest-out

283
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:06,033
if we had some people
up in this bitch.

284
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,601
Shit is
fucked up, man.

285
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,903
Mm.

286
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:14,407
Damn, Junior.
You had a night, huh?

287
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,776
Even for a legendary
motherfucker like
yourself...

288
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,312
Drop it.

289
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,614
What is wrong
with you, man?

290
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:26,186
'Cause Elena
didn't open up
the door for your ass,

291
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:30,890
you just gonna
let all this shit
fly out, huh?

292
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,059
Come on, Jimmy.

293
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,428
Lighten up.

294
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,703
Come and get me.

295
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:47,474
So you guys are going for
a wiretap on that port case?

296
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:50,377
Uh-huh.

297
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,812
They got every
swingin' dick

298
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,581
with a shield
on that detail but me.

299
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,982
( trickling )

300
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,684
Jealous, bitch?

301
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,053
I'd rather be back
in Homicide.

302
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:04,157
I'd take your place
in a heartbeat.

303
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,128
- Why?
- ( trickling stops )

304
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,401
That floater showin' up
in your dreams?

305
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,204
Nah, it's not
just her.

306
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:21,074
I mean, who am I,
Captain Chesapeake?

307
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,743
I need to get off
that boat, Bunk.

308
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:26,513
I need to do a case.

309
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,317
I mean,
if I'm not gonna--

310
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,688
if I'm no good for...

311
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:50,002
That's all you want,
just go and ask Rawls.

312
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,938
He'll put you on this
straight away.

313
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:55,208
- Yeah, why wouldn't he?
- Yeah.

314
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,080
Ah, Jimmy...

315
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:08,788
After which
I tell Horse to go down
the southeast lot

316
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,824
and steal
the most expensive
thing he can drive,

317
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,293
which he does.

318
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,995
And we box it up and ship it
to every port you can name.

319
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,797
Where is it now?

320
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:20,233
Somewhere between New Orleans
and the West Coast.

321
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,069
( laughing )
How's that for
your kid brother?

322
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,407
You said you were gonna
bring something over?

323
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:28,675
Just this.

324
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,645
Read it.

325
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,181
What is it?

326
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,449
A confirmation
letter, like.

327
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,851
You know that labor position
on the port advisory board,

328
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,453
that one I was
tellin' you about?

329
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:41,854
I put you up for it.
You're on.

330
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,057
I'm on, huh?

331
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,594
I ain't been union since
they closed the drydock.

332
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,128
How come I'm on?

333
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:52,399
The board chair and me,
we got a relationship.

334
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,601
You mean,
you greased it.

335
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,872
The chairman, he thought
you'd be right for it, is all.

336
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,941
There's a stipend
comes with it.

337
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,410
Couple hundred
a month, Lou.

338
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,078
When I get
home at night,

339
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,281
I just wanna watch
a ball game or somethin'.

340
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:11,318
I'm not up to go
to no meetings
or anything.

341
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:14,921
Christ, Lou, you don't got
to go to all the meetings.

342
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:18,591
Just show up once in a while,
let 'em know you're alive.

343
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,995
That's not for me.

344
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,897
What's for you?

345
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,401
That shitwagon parked
out front, needs a battery?

346
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,272
Or this kitchen here,
been rigged the same way
for 25 years.

347
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,575
Whatever I got
comes straight.

348
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:41,180
That's real noble,
big brother.

349
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:44,317
Not noble, right.

350
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,355
The shipbuilders local
goes belly-up

351
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:50,490
and that makes you
some kind of martyr?

352
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,459
Hell, the only difference
between me and you

353
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,462
- is you picked the wrong union!
- That ain't the only
difference.

354
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:59,266
- If you were
in my position--
- I'm not!

355
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,436
And to tell you
the truth,

356
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,706
I'm glad I don't have to make
those kind of choices.

357
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,545
Come on, kid.

358
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,348
Sit down.

359
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,667
You really used to race
pigeons with my Pe-Pop?

360
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,436
We all did back then.

361
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:40,707
I give one to a seaman
on a Dutch tanker one time,

362
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,942
he set her loose
in the middle
of the ocean.

363
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:46,413
Damn if she didn't
find her way back
to Hull Street,

364
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:49,282
which, by the way,
is more than I can say

365
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:53,720
about your grandfather
when he was in the bag.

366
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,722
Ziggy:
How come they
don't fly away?

367
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,124
( quacks )

368
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:01,361
His wings are clipped.

369
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,469
How much for
this one, Mr. Diz?

370
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,771
Why don't you start out
with pigeons, Zig?

371
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:14,807
- You can train pigeons.
- Them things got lice.

372
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:18,345
They bring the plague,
for Christ sakes.

373
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,317
( birds clucking )

374
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:28,621
Thanks, Mr. Diz.

375
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,692
I tried.
Rawls hates his guts.

376
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,394
With reasons.

377
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:37,364
But the thing of it is,
Jimmy's dying inside.

378
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,299
He's a train wreck unless
he catches a real case.

379
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,502
- Lester: But good police.
- Bunk: Always.

380
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,971
The thing of it is,
Lieutenant,

381
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:48,508
that is, Jimmy McNulty,
when he ain't policing,

382
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:51,478
he's a picture postcard
of a drunken,

383
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:53,312
self-destructive
fuck-up.

384
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,782
And when he is
policing,

385
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:58,351
he's pretty much
the same motherfucker...

386
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,820
but on a good case,

387
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,922
I mean runnin'
at the front of
the pack.

388
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:07,394
That's as close
as the man comes
to being right.

389
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:10,430
Go back to Rawls.

390
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:16,335
So I get paid?

391
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:17,704
Yeah, you get paid,
but you don't get paid.

392
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,506
- We get paid.
- ( shutter clicks )

393
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:21,408
Why don't they
give you the money
and leave me out of it?

394
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,042
'Cause we need
someone to be

395
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,711
confidential
informant number 238,

396
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:26,513
registered with
the department.

397
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:28,481
See we get you registered,
we get paid.

398
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,683
So you're gonna
send my picture...

399
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,519
And your
Social Security number...

400
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:34,421
...and they give me money,
which you guys keep,

401
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:35,888
and I don't get
nothin'?

402
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,425
Hey, cuz,
did you do anything
to deserve the money?

403
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,393
- Huh?
- Did you?

404
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:43,329
Yeah, we cracked
a fucking case wide open.

405
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,698
We brought back very
significant information

406
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,333
about a major
drug trafficker.

407
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:48,535
That's what we did.

408
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,703
But that's your
fucking job, right?

409
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,005
You get paid
a salary for that.

410
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,543
Bernard, you're
upsetting my partner, man.

411
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:59,512
What are you doing?

412
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:02,248
10%.

413
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:03,916
10% goes to me
and I don't tell.

414
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:07,319
You don't tell
because your ma
and my ma are sisters.

415
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,221
That's why you
don't tell, Bernard.

416
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,857
We're not even gonna
use your real name.

417
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:13,092
You're gonna be
registered as Fuzzy Dunlop,
a street name.

418
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,695
- "Fuzzy Dunlop"?
- Herc: Yeah.

419
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,097
10%.

420
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,902
Wonderful, now I'm in business
with the whole fucking family.

421
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,637
( clicks )

422
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,940
It's payday, Zig.

423
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,042
Once again.

424
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,683
All that, huh?

425
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,250
We're rolling
out there.

426
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,488
I can't hand the shit
off fast enough.

427
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:44,724
Nice sled you got.

428
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:47,494
Zero percent interest.
Money's cheap.

429
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,529
Money's cheap?
What the fuck
does that mean?

430
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:53,265
Means I got a good deal,
ya peckerhead.

431
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,035
You oughta think
about gettin' some
fresh wheels yourself.

432
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,870
Yeah, I'm gonna
do that.

433
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,773
You gonna get a car,
you're gonna need some jack.

434
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,175
Worry about
yourself.

435
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,316
I heard you
took on Maui.

436
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,318
Boy needed
to get schooled.

437
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:14,521
What are you, some
kinda bad ass now?

438
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:18,057
( cell phone rings )

439
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:21,794
- Yeah, it's me.
- Man: Hey, Niko,
things okay?

440
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,730
Things are goin' great,
you know?

441
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,297
If you need more,
talk to Sergei.

442
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,199
Yeah, I gotta
see you soon.

443
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,502
- Look, I 'll call you back
in a few, all right?
- Okay.

444
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,337
- ( beeps )
- That the man?

445
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:34,541
- You don't have
to concern yourself--
- I wanna meet him.

446
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,709
Let me handle
the business.

447
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,745
I mean, you're
gettin' paid, right?

448
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:40,513
Fuck you!

449
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:42,549
I'll play the game
for myself.

450
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:44,216
Take the money, Zig.

451
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,518
Oh, you don't think
I can do it?

452
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,920
Pick up the fuckin'
money, Ziggy.

453
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,322
I don't want it,
you pick it up.

454
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,725
You.

455
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,795
- Fuck you.
- ( fluttering )

456
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:04,637
( modem buzzing,
chirping )

457
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,505
Man's voice:
I was wonderin' about those
Lazy-Boy chairs I ordered.

458
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:08,274
They come in yet?

459
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,409
- Man 2: How many you order?
- Customer: That'd be three.

460
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,546
Man 2:
Your order's in.

461
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:15,447
Man 3:
Yes.

462
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:17,516
- Man 2: Hey, it's Nick.
- How's it going?

463
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,518
I'm ready to talk
about more, okay?

464
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,287
You just say
where and when.

465
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,623
Man 3:
I'll call you back.

466
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,394
Not as careful as
Barksdale's people were.

467
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,730
This ain't
West Baltimore.

468
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,131
They're on
their phones

469
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,701
because they don't
expect us to be on 'em.

470
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,270
Let me shorten
this conversation for you--

471
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,538
it's never
gonna happen.

472
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,407
McNulty
goes after it.

473
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:42,909
I could use
someone like him.

474
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,144
And I could use
three more inches
of meat.

475
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,246
It ain't
gonna happen.

476
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,551
You ever see
how a dog gets,

477
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:54,954
when he smells a bone
buried out in the yard?

478
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,690
Yeah, and I
seen one take a shit
on my carpet, too.

479
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,358
And don't give me
any of that

480
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:03,095
"he's got that
fire in the belly"
garbage, either.

481
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,798
The answer is no.

482
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,500
"What I need
from you I get.

483
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,870
No bullshit,
no arguments."

484
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,071
What?

485
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,906
When I agreed to take
these murders for you,

486
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:18,344
I made my terms clear,
remember?

487
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:21,180
I need McNulty
on this detail.

488
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,449
Jesus, Lieutenant.
When I said "anything,"

489
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:26,118
I meant I'd let you
have a kiss.

490
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,955
Feel my tits
or somethin', you know?

491
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:31,057
But not this.

492
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:33,760
You want me to clear
those bodies?

493
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,008
See that you do.

494
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,017
Poot:
Who they?

495
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,220
Pssh.
They might be some C.B.S. boys
drifting from down south.

496
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,456
Or might be
some of Tavon's crew
from over on Edmondson.

497
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,526
This far over?

498
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,529
- I know one thing, though.
- What?

499
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,099
They servin'
our customers.

500
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,269
( phone rings )

501
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,038
Marine Unit,
Diggins.

502
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,740
Daniels:
I'm lookin' for McNulty.

503
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,275
McNulty,
for you.

504
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:33,552
- Yeah?
- It's Daniels.

505
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,455
You're back to work
for us...

506
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:40,893
( Daniels continues )

507
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,695
McNulty:
Thanks, Lieutenant.

508
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,332
( door opening )

509
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,943
"Fuzzy Dunlop"?

510
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:59,445
This new generation,
with the names...

511
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,852
150? Jesus.

512
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:08,821
He turned us onto
the Sobotka kid, Lieutenant.

513
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,466
Bunk:
This is the other half
of the case, right here.

514
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,201
Three apartments
on the sixth floor,

515
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:23,936
all leased out
to Pyramid Incorporated,

516
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,705
the same people who own
the drug warehouse.

517
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:27,774
Do we think this
is where the girls
are staying,

518
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:29,241
or something more?

519
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,277
No, building's too nice
for room and board.

520
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,814
You see, a building
this nice is for the johns.
Makes them feel safer.

521
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:36,482
How do they bring
them in, the lobby?

522
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,284
Garage, probably.

523
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,286
Kima:
Either they have
a garage card,

524
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,721
or they're
being shuttled in
by someone who does.

525
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,490
Pearlman:
You get that piece
and you're in.

526
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,925
If the people
running the girls

527
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:47,760
are connected to the people
running the drugs,

528
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,495
then you can knock off
the brothel

529
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:52,431
and then listen in
on your wiretaps.

530
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,500
Tickle the wire
like that.

531
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,936
Exactly.

532
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:02,842
Pleasure boats,
topless women...

533
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,877
I'm tellin' you,
now that the weather's
turned...

534
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:07,713
I gotta roll,
Diggsy.

535
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:10,316
Thanks.

536
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:19,025
( rap music playing )

537
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:21,760
We ain't be been paid
since yesterday.

538
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,295
And the day
before that.

539
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:26,198
What the fuck?
Come on on, dawg,
are we back up or what?

540
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,900
We up, but we ain't
in it, though.

541
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,301
What we got
can't stand up

542
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,303
to what they movin'
down the way, so...

543
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:34,841
Dag, boy, we about
to dry up and blow away
and shit.

544
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,508
Yo man, I ain't got
nothin' for ya.

545
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,677
Man, how you gonna
act like that?

546
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,246
Man, look,
I feel you,

547
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:42,448
but I still gotta
let you go, so...

548
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,518
Well, at least
we due for some of

549
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,387
that separation pay
though, right?

550
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,056
Man, you better go on

551
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:52,992
before I
lose my composure
out this bitch.

552
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,931
These motherfuckers.

553
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,533
"Separation pay."

554
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,171
Separate your ass.
Hey, yo!

555
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:08,074
Assumption number one is
the people running the girls

556
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:11,277
and the people running
the drugs are the same crew.

557
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:13,779
Assumption number two
is that the apartments
in that condo

558
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,348
are working as a cathouse
with those Russian girls.

559
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:19,518
Which means
to get someone in there
undercover to make a case.

560
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:24,356
I'm thinking we need
a more subtle touch here.

561
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:28,127
I'd march into hell
for you, Lieutenant.
You know that.

562
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:30,997
He doesn't look like
he'd have to pay.

563
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:35,401
- Kima?
- Sorry, no.

564
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,602
Domestic issues
at home.

565
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,370
Same for me.

566
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,907
Nadine would
have 'em in a jar
by the side of the bed,

567
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:43,275
if she even heard
tell of it.

568
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,751
What?

569
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,321
Takes a whore
to catch a whore.

570
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:57,189
( laughing )

571
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,791
What the fuck
did I do?

572
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:01,527
Patron:
Give me a couple beers,
Dolores.

573
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:04,096
Look at this.

574
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:08,034
I say,
look at this.

575
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:10,536
Dolo? Dolores,
is that you?

576
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:14,473
Hey, Dolores,
I'd like you to meet
my attorney,

577
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:17,409
this is Steven L. Miles.

578
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,745
( laughing )

579
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:21,347
Now, I may
not be able

580
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:24,016
to see through
all the bullshit
in here, but he can.

581
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:26,552
So, if you will,
I'd like a stiff one
for myself

582
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:28,754
and one
for my counselor.

583
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:30,022
Tell me it's a fake.

584
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:31,357
That'd be lying, hon.

585
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:33,525
Is they real diamonds
around its neck?

586
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,095
You sick, boy.
You just sick!

587
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,829
Like I'm the only guy
in South Balmer

588
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,566
that ever tried
to win the affections
of a farm animal.

589
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,569
( laughing )

590
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:47,206
Enough talk.
Now, chop, chop.

591
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:49,208
I'd like one
for the house

592
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:52,011
and don't forget
to water my fine,
feathered friend here.

593
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,612
( all laughing )

594
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,582
If it's for the duck,
the next round is on me.

595
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,284
Oh, easy there.

596
00:31:58,384 --> 00:31:59,785
We're gonna need
a saucer, hon.

597
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,587
Put some beer in it.
He needs a chaser.

598
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:05,557
And put it on my tab,
Dolores.

599
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:08,894
Pace yourself.

600
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,762
You're drinkin' with
the longshoremen tonight.

601
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,099
( laughing )

602
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:21,740
McNulty:
That look right
to you?

603
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,544
Same truck as
carried the girls,
same mope driving.

604
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:26,612
What about
the passenger?

605
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:29,581
Looks the part
to me.

606
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,090
Container ship
on the Talco line,

607
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,993
name of Caspia,
docks tomorrow a.m.

608
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:43,962
Our man
Horseface on it?

609
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:45,331
I better call
the lieutenant,

610
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:49,368
let him know we gotta
set up on this.

611
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,471
This time, though,
we got the wire up.

612
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:54,440
Eyes and ears both.

613
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,603
There goes
the shuttle.

614
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:31,777
Kima:
What's he waitin' on?

615
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:36,014
He's getting himself
all steeled up
to tell some tales.

616
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:38,184
Lying
to the wife's easy.

617
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:40,586
It's looking your kid
in the eye that's
the hard part.

618
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:45,257
( engine starting )

619
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:55,634
( tires screeching )

620
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:00,038
Police!

621
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:10,216
Let's see
your license.

622
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:16,522
"Robert Johnson."
You believe that?

623
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:21,227
Bob, I'm very
disappointed in you.

624
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:23,362
Wanna go home, Bob?

625
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:26,965
Okay, suppose a lonely fella
wants to meet a nice young lady

626
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,369
in this town.
How's he go about it?

627
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:35,207
Uh, he'd dial
that phone number.

628
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:40,379
Dial the number,
what else?

629
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:44,616
Punch in those
four numbers there.

630
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,386
- And?
- Ask for Eve.

631
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:50,489
- What?
- Ask for Eve.

632
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,601
- Go on, go home.
- ( engine starts )

633
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:07,306
Godspeed, Bob.

634
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:08,974
Johnson.

635
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:11,543
My ticket
to the dance.

636
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,824
Here we go.
We got one.

637
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,659
- ( radio beeping )
- 12-14, Kima.

638
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:30,162
We got a disappeared can
just hit the chassis.

639
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:31,597
Kima:
Affirmative.
I'll eyeball it to the gate.

640
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:33,399
- ( radio beeps )
- Raise our boys.

641
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:35,767
- Kima: Right.
- What's Kima rollin' as?

642
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,336
Gas and Electric.

643
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:51,650
( modem beeping )

644
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:58,924
Man's voice:
Yes?

645
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:01,327
Man 2:
Everything's good.

646
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:03,362
- Man 1: You coming in now?
- Yes.

647
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:07,599
( chuckles )

648
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:55,046
Kima:
White D-A-C truck
coming at you

649
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,115
pulling a red can.
Serial number

650
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,050
X-W-B, as in boy...

651
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,354
C-one-five-seven-seven-
two-six-eight.

652
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:05,257
Driver, white male
with brown hair, copy?

653
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:07,125
- ( radio beeps )
- Carver: Copy.

654
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,361
Kima:
I'm out of this as soon
as he clears the gate.

655
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,363
The van has too much
profile on it right now.

656
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,865
- ( beeps )
- Copy that, too, we're up.

657
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,773
Broken seal?

658
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:23,775
Hey, Frank.

659
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,377
What's missing?

660
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:28,113
Nothing
so as we can tell.
Can's full of diapers.

661
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:30,248
- Diapers?
- Disposables, yeah.

662
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:32,083
I'm thinkin'
not even your crew

663
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,653
would get around
to stealin' Pampers
off the dock, right?

664
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,655
- Not so sure.
- ( laughing )

665
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,525
Customs seal
probably just broke
on offload is all.

666
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,560
( coughs )

667
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:49,401
Hey, when's Bea Russell
coming back from the
Fairfield Piers?

668
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:52,037
Who, Beadie?
She's not down
Fairfield.

669
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:55,173
Don't you worry, Frank.
Your girl'll be back
soon enough.

670
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,075
- Yeah?
- She's detailed.

671
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:59,545
Something to do
with city police.

672
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:12,824
All right,
we're up.

673
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,926
Kima on radio:
I'm out, you have
the eyeball.

674
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,295
- ( radio beeps )
- Carver: 12-08, copy that.

675
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:19,398
( tires screech )

676
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:25,737
First I got this thing
on my phone bill,

677
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,507
and now I hear
Bea Russell is doin' some
shit with real police.

678
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:30,208
You're paranoid,
Frank.

679
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,712
- Why would she lie?
- Shit if I know.

680
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:37,082
The Greek has
two today, right?

681
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,284
Boris comes back
in an hour.

682
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:40,719
The second can's
in a lower bay,

683
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,054
ready to offload
when I get to it.

684
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,190
Check that can through
straight-up.

685
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,527
You got it?
Enter it on the computer
just like any other.

686
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:50,462
And the next can after it--
make that one disappear.

687
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,297
You want me
to lose a clean can?

688
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:56,768
- And give it
to the Russian, yeah.
- You gonna tell 'em?

689
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:58,537
If I'm going nuts,
I'll calm down tomorrow

690
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,305
and we'll slip
the hot can off the pier.

691
00:39:00,406 --> 00:39:04,676
If I'm right about this,
they'll thank me.

692
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:08,079
And Horse, make sure
nobody's living in that can
when you stack it.

693
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,615
I know, I know.

694
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,123
Ooh, we got
somethin' here.

695
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:22,794
Another disappeared can
just hit the chassis.

696
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,696
They're runnin' 'em
out in tandem.

697
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:26,698
- Huh?
- That means one
after the other, Jimmy.

698
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:29,000
- I know what it means.
- 12-08.

699
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,503
- Carver: 12-08.
- Carver, what's the status
of your truck?

700
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:33,939
Dropped the can
at the warehouse
and rolled out.

701
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,241
You wanted us
on the truck or the can?

702
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,709
- ( radio beeps )
- The can.

703
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,478
Copy.

704
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,380
I got no eyes
at the port.

705
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:44,215
- Kima?
- She pulled up.

706
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,818
I got it.

707
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:48,820
But the truck already left.
You're not gonna make it.

708
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,690
I'll call the M.P.A.,
delay the truck.

709
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:54,325
Do it.

710
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:57,328
You're still here?

711
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,465
Good call.

712
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,280
( tires screeching )

713
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,750
( police siren
wailing )

714
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:28,193
License and
registration, please.

715
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:30,862
You were doing 24
in a 20 zone.

716
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:34,800
- You stop for 24?
- License and registration.

717
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:51,142
( modem beeping )

718
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:55,246
Prez:
Christ, I wish we had a tap
on the port office phone.

719
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,450
( speaking Greek
Léyete.

720
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,753
I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

721
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,388
That last little item
we sent out?

722
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:04,756
It's wrong.

723
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,825
I knew it was wrong
when I let it go, see?

724
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:09,828
Not on the phone,
Frank.

725
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:15,033
Okay, but this time,
he needs to be there.

726
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:19,270
In fact, he wants to be there
to hear this shit.

727
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:33,819
( TV playing )

728
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:42,127
( speaking Greek )

729
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:48,033
( mutters in Greek )

730
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:55,073
Go 'head, open it.

731
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,570
"Bobbie Dolls."

732
00:43:25,671 --> 00:43:28,106
( chuckles )

733
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,590
What the fuck
is this bullshit, eh?

734
00:43:45,691 --> 00:43:47,092
I am waiting
for Russian vodka

735
00:43:47,192 --> 00:43:49,527
and you bring me
trash from Taiwan.

736
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,429
Gimme your phone.

737
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:52,864
Fucking Polacks.

738
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:56,467
Are they thieves
or are they stupid?

739
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,437
- ( keypad beeps )
- ( modem beeps )

740
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:03,809
He's dialing
the same number.

741
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:06,745
- Spiros: Léyete.
- It came, but it's nothing.

742
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:08,546
( speaking Greek )
It's bullshit!

743
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,082
( speaking Greek )

744
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:12,751
I was expecting this.

745
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:15,520
Just...
just get rid of it.

746
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,388
Get rid of it
where?

747
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:21,392
( speaking Greek )
Drop it in the fucking
street.

748
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:26,597
This is sweet.

749
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:28,599
The boss man.

750
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,969
And we're on him.

751
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:33,772
- 7:00 in the morning?
- Man, what the fuck
you think?

752
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:36,374
We got to be there,
in place, when they come on.

753
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:38,243
Shit is early, yo.

754
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:39,610
Yo, y'all down
for this?

755
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:41,346
'cause I can find me
some motherfuckers

756
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:43,148
to swing bats for me
if I have to.

757
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:45,216
You ain't say nothin'
about no bats.

758
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,018
- A'ight.
- That's what the fuck
I'm talkin' bout.

759
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:48,519
Bring your boys too,
you know what I'm sayin'?

760
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:49,587
7:00, yo.

761
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,258
- Hey, Poot.
- Yo, Poot.

762
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:56,928
Come on, man.
Come on.

763
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,865
God damn,
you's a pussy-crazed
motherfucker.

764
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:02,167
A nigger can't
look at a female?

765
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:05,236
Yeah, man,
but you be gettin'
dizzy behind that shit.

766
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:06,537
Least I be
gettin' some.

767
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,073
Yeah, well I be
gettin' some, too.

768
00:45:08,173 --> 00:45:10,809
But I don't make it
my everything.

769
00:45:12,978 --> 00:45:16,247
- ( radio beeps )
- McNulty: Lieutenant,
you still up?

770
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,216
- Daniels: I'm here.
- ( radio beeps )

771
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:20,986
I'm still on this second can,
but it doesn't make sense.

772
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:23,822
He went to ground
at an appliance store
off Eastern.

773
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:26,024
Now he's dumping it.

774
00:45:26,124 --> 00:45:29,194
Daniels:
10-4. Come home.

775
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:32,297
You don't want
to sit on the can?

776
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,165
Negative.

777
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:36,467
Can is clean.

00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,338
( engine starts )

779
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:50,849
( laughing )

780
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:55,420
I don't know,
Uncle Frank.

781
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,623
Puttin' two and two together
and comin' up with six, maybe.

782
00:45:58,723 --> 00:46:02,293
- Maybe.
- You called Spiros
still, right?

783
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,766
Spiros'll know
what to do.

784
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:10,601
Come past
early tomorrow.

785
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,104
I wanna get down
to the diner first thing.

786
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:14,906
All right.

787
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:17,275
( laughter continues )

788
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:21,246
I can't keep up
with him.

789
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:23,514
What's with the duck?

790
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,018
Ziggy.

791
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:37,628
- Daniels around?
- No.

792
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,564
What's the deal
with can number two?

793
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:41,799
No contraband.

794
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,634
Heard them complainin'
about it on the wire.

795
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,636
Somebody fucked up.

796
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,973
Fact is,

797
00:46:48,073 --> 00:46:50,842
they even called
the boss man about it.

798
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:53,945
( laughing )

799
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:56,581
That's a good day.
You guys goin'
for a taste?

800
00:46:56,681 --> 00:47:00,385
No, I'm gonna
chase the paperwork.

801
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:03,588
I gotta spring the sitter,
but for a ride home,

802
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:04,990
I'll go
for a quick beer.

803
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,591
More'n one,
I get sleepy.

804
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:09,827
Yeah, me too.

805
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:14,832
- What, you short a car?
- Need new brake pads.

806
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:18,169
Okay.

807
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:25,076
( door closes )

808
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:30,315
Two-- boys.

809
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:32,483
How 'bout you?

810
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,552
Boy and a girl.

811
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:36,087
And your husband,
he, uh...

812
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,923
none of my business,
I know, but...

813
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:39,424
he die
or something?

814
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:42,260
You mean 'cause
no one would leave
a beauty like me

815
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,594
unless he kicked?

816
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,297
I was just askin'.

817
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:48,533
He left me.

818
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:50,835
Left us.

819
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:53,271
Picked up,
moved south.

820
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:58,109
Said it was either
my job or him.

821
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:01,646
I was neglecting my duties
around the house, all that.

822
00:48:01,746 --> 00:48:05,250
Said that he didn't
get married in order
to cook his own dinner.

823
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,619
Anyway, he's cooking
his own dinner now.

824
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:15,393
What about with you
and your wife?

825
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:17,462
What happened?

826
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,799
She died.

827
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,369
( laughing )

828
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,105
Not now, Gus.
I'm good.

829
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:30,041
Gus:
Whatever you say,
Jimmy.

830
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,711
So you about
ready to go?

831
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:35,146
Sure.

832
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:38,383
Be right back,
I just gotta
make a call.

833
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:59,304
( line ringing )

834
00:48:59,404 --> 00:49:00,905
Recording:
Please enter your code now.

835
00:49:01,006 --> 00:49:02,573
( keypad beeps )

836
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:06,411
Woman:
Hi, may I help you?

837
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:10,415
- Yeah, lemme talk to Eve.
- ( line rings )

838
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:13,051
- This is Eve.
- I'm looking to connect.

839
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:14,719
Would you like
a date tonight?

840
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:19,024
No, not tonight.
I'm back in town in
a couple of nights.

841
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:21,426
Have you been
entertained by us
before?

842
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:23,294
No, first time for me.

843
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,430
Well, we can arrange
whatever you like,
whenever you like.

844
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,698
- Yeah.
- What kind of girl
are you looking for?

845
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,902
We have a variety
for you to choose from
when you arrive.

846
00:49:32,003 --> 00:49:33,904
When are you
thinking of coming?

847
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:37,442
( faint rap music
playing )

848
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,336

849

Computer recording:
Hi, choose a game.

850
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:09,474
Um, just gimme
a minute?

851
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:12,310
Computer recording:
Can you guess this word?

852
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:19,117

00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:26,224

00:50:32,597 --> 00:50:34,499

Can you guess

00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:49,080
Recording:
Stop!

859
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:52,683
Move away from
the cookie jar.

860
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:58,323
( musical beeping
continues )

861

Hi, choose a game.

00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:05,130
Can you guess
this word?

863
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:11,102
Beadie:
Turn it off...

864
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:15,039
( musical beeping )

865

Can you guess
this word?

867
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:34,592
Long day.

868
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:37,395
Yeah, me too.

869
00:51:51,176 --> 00:51:53,478
Thanks for the beer.

870
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:56,214
Computer recording:
Goodbye.

871
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,100
Man:
Hey, yo, they comin',
they comin'.

872
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:19,237
What these fuckers
think they lookin' at?

873
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:21,506
Nigger, you done lost
your motherfuckin' mind?

874
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:23,541
You standin'
on my real estate.

875
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,476
Mine now.

876
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:26,911
Took it while you
was restin'.

877
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,348
Y'all too late.

878
00:52:33,418 --> 00:52:36,521
Look, I'm gonna let you
walk off right now,

879
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:38,055
or we can do it
the other way.

880
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,491
Who you got to do it
the other way?

881
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:43,494
Them? Pfft.

882
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,398
You gonna see me
in your sleep.

883
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,767
- Yeah, I know, I know.
- Yeah.

884
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,941
Man:
That's right,
keep walkin', bitch.

885
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:59,043
They gonna
come back.

886
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:01,912
Yeah, way we just
punked them?

887
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,382
They got to.

888
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:12,857
Where is he?

889
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:14,425
You can talk
to me, Frank.

890
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,927
- This is bigger'n you.
- I'll tell him what you say.

891
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:20,398
Bullshit.
Come on, Nick.

892
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:25,503
( speaking Greek )

893
00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:29,507
That's The Greek?
That old guy?

894
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:31,709
I seen him in here
before.

895
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:35,446
Have a seat.

896
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:41,752
( speaking Greek )

897
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:55,032
A long time since
we talk, hey, Frank?

898
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:56,734
Coffee,
something?

899
00:53:56,834 --> 00:54:00,037
We're good.

900
00:54:00,137 --> 00:54:02,473
What's on
your mind?

901
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:05,175
Every
goddamn thing.

902
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:08,479
For one, I think
my cell phone's
bein' tapped.

903
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,147
All of the sudden,
the phone company don't care

904
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,916
if I pay my bills
anymore.

905
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:14,285
Meantime, I hear that
our regular port cop,

906
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:15,753
the one that
found your girls,

907
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:17,822
she got pulled off
to work some special thing

908
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,290
with the city police.

909
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,492
- So you switched the cans?
- I ran a test.

910
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,194
I gave you that clean one,
put yours in the stacks.

911
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:27,298
Straight away,
the M.P.A. cops stop
that Russian's truck,

912
00:54:27,398 --> 00:54:29,400
right after
he picked it up.

913
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,902
I think someone's got
a line into our computer.

914
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,504
Very smart.

915
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:36,341
As soon as you called,
I shut down the warehouse.

916
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:37,942
That's fine.

917
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:39,977
But now we're going to have
to open the warehouse up again.

918
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:43,914
Lose a few more clean cans,
deliver them there.

919
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:47,284
Someone's watching,
show them we have
nothing to hide.

920
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:49,854
Our cut stays
the same though, right?

921
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,956
- Spiros: You kidding?
- What's your name?

922
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:56,994
- Nick.
- Sobotka.

923
00:54:57,094 --> 00:54:59,029
Oh.

924
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,399
Well, that's
a fair question, Niko.

925
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:03,801
But it has to be
the same for everyone.

926
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:05,503
No work, no pay.

927
00:55:05,603 --> 00:55:06,671
Doesn't matter
what's in the cans,

928
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:08,406
we still gotta
check 'em through.

929
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:09,974
That's work, isn't it?

930
00:55:10,074 --> 00:55:12,209
If we take gas,
so do you.

931
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,412
- Frank: You don't understand--
- I understand completely.

932
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:16,481
No one is in this
for love.

933
00:55:17,482 --> 00:55:19,684
It ain't
just the money.

934
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:21,419
I got things
happening right now.

935
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:22,987
Things with my union.
Right now!

936
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,190
Not a fuckin' month
from now,

937
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,125
when the legislative
session is history.

938
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:29,427
Now!

939
00:55:34,732 --> 00:55:36,934
Okay.

940
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,703
We pay you still.

941
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:41,005
I'm thinking
of all the business
we do in the future,

942
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:45,610

you should be happy.

00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,679
Thanks.

It's a new world,
Frank.

945
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:59,089
You should go out
and spend some of the money

946
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,458
on something
you can touch.

947
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:03,694
A new car,
a new coat.

948
00:56:03,794 --> 00:56:06,931
It's why we get up
in the morning, hm?

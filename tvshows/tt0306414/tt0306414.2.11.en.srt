from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,600
Wake up, Baltimore. It's 6:00 a.m....

3
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,900
Police!

4
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,500
Ready?

5
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,300
Freeze, FBl!

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,100
-All clear.
-Check upstairs.

7
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,000
Turn around.

8
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,900
Put your hands up. Behind your neck.

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,900
Keep them there.

10
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,600
No, nothing here. All clear.

11
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,700
All clear.

12
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,000
You won't find a goddamn thing!
I can tell you that right now.

13
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,900
Ain't got shit on me.

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,500
Fuck! You ain't got nothing.
I'm telling you. Nothing!

15
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Move, shitbird.

16
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,200
FBl, show me your hands!

17
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,100
Get down, fuck! Get down!

18
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Nice.

19
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,700
Bingo.

20
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,500
-From behind your clothes washer.
-That's heroin, 300 gelcaps.

21
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,900
And on today's Chip Franklin Show
at noon...

22
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,500
Chip will be live at Arundel Mills Mall
asking local retailers:

23
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,900
"What do you get
for the guy who has everything?"

24
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Now here's Steve Stewart with sports.

25
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,500
The Orioles continue to....

26
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,600
-We could take him now.
-Not enough profile.

27
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,400
Fucking feds.

28
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,600
Be advised, target 27 is on the move.

29
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,100
I don't get it.
Why leave Vondopoulos out on the street?

30
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,100
The text message that told him to clean up,
it came from someone higher up.

31
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,500
Someone we don't know.

32
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,700
We leave him on the street
after these raids...

33
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,300
he'll probably make contact
with whoever's above him.

34
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,000
Either another text message or a meet.

35
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,200
What's with George Glekas?

36
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,100
I'm afraid he's gonna duck this warrant.

37
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,200
-Chester Karol Sobotka?
-It's Frank Sobotka's kid.

38
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,600
Frank's kid kills one of our targets?
Are you shitting me?

39
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,100
Why? What for?

40
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,200
We hit the store this morning.

41
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Every shred of paper's gone.
Just a bloodstain on the floor.

42
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,500
So we go over to his house a half hour later
with the warrant...

43
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,100
and it's full up with red-eyed Greek relations
looking at us like we're braindeads.

44
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,700
Homicide, Shea.

45
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,400
-This is Daniels, out at Southeast.
-Yes, sir.

46
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,300
Who caught the Highlandtown murder
the night before last?

47
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,100
Jay Landsman, sir.

48
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,800
I'll be right over.

49
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,200
Go get the interviews started.

50
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,400
-Lieutenant?
-Hey, Lt.

51
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,300
What the fuck is that about?

52
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
How did we do this morning?

53
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,700
Eton and Sergei are in. So is the madam.

54
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,700
Glekas, I'm not sure.

55
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,400
-The feds are waiting on Sobotka.
-What are they waiting for?

56
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,700
You don't wanna know.

57
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,300
Jesus, Larry....

58
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,300
Jesus, Larry....

59
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,900
The thing is, I think we gotta reach out
to a criminal lawyer real quick.

60
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,100
If the union guys can't handle this mess...

61
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,100
he's gonna have a bail hearing tomorrow.

62
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,800
-Do you have any details?
-I don't know nothing...

63
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,500
except he's locked up for it.
I can't see him till 10:00.

64
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,400
-That's the only time?
-Visiting hours, yeah.

65
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Look, everything's gonna be fine.

66
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
-FBl! All of you move, now!
-What the fuck is this?

67
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,000
-FBl, move!
-Against the wall.

68
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,200
He's here.

69
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,500
Got another problem here, Larry.

70
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,700
Big man on the docks.

71
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,600
You don't look so big now, do you?

72
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Ma.

73
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Pop.

74
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,400
It's gone.

75
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,400
And the money, too.

76
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,400
They say you need to come in.

77
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,400
They said the warrant
is at Southeastern police district.

78
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,300
They're out there now.

79
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,600
Showtime, Franky.

80
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
-Frank.
-Sir, any comment?

81
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,000
Is it just you, or is it the whole union?

82
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,400
What's your comment
on the charges being brought against you?

83
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,100
Sir, do you have anything at all to say?
Any comment at all?

84
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,000
How will you answer
the charges against you?

85
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,300
Let me ask you, who exactly am I working
all these dead girls for?

86
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,800
The Homicide unit, right?

87
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,800
The same Homicide unit that can't put
two and two together and pick up a phone...

88
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,600
Ieaving me to read it a day-and-a-half later
in The Baltimore Sun.

89
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,800
-What did you take from the scene?
-Photos, latents, spent casings.

90
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,300
Fuck.

91
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,900
They cleaned everything else?

92
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,700
Even for a supremely
fucked-up police department...

93
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,600
this takes the prize.

94
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,800
How'd the kid play it?

95
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,500
He signed a full statement.

96
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,000
He said that there was an argument
about a stolen car or two.

97
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,000
Think he'll open up and talk more?

98
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
He's been processed and assigned a PD.

99
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,600
If you want to take a run at the kid,
you're gonna have to get around his lawyer.

100
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,500
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. It's my bad.

101
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,800
State your name, asshole.
What's your name?

102
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,800
What's your name?

103
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,000
State your name.

104
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,100
Come on, you know this part.
Give us a name.

105
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,300
There is your name.

106
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,200
State your name.

107
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,300
No name?

108
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,100
-For now, we'll just call you Boris.
-Boris.

109
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,900
Why always "Boris"?

110
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,700
Racketeering. Wire fraud.
Conspiracy to import heroin.

111
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,900
Conspiracy to violate
federal customs statutes.

112
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,500
White slavery.

113
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,600
Today we're only charging
the customs violations, Mr. Sobotka.

114
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,100
But eventually, a grand jury indictment
will expose you to a lot more.

115
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,500
But eventually, a grand jury indictment
will expose you to a lot more.

116
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,200
Name names, and come clean.
You help yourself and your union.

117
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,600
Help my union?

118
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,900
For 25 years,
we've been dying slow down there.

119
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,200
Dry docks rusting, piers standing empty.

120
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,400
My friends and their kids,
like we got the cancer.

121
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,200
No lifeline got thrown all that time.
Nothing from nobody.

122
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,700
And now you wanna help us?

123
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,000
Help me?

124
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,000
-What's your full name?
-Michael McArdle.

125
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,800
-White Mike.
-Yeah, that's right.

126
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,200
Listen to this, Mikey.

127
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,900
I wanna know it wasn't your people...

128
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,200
dropped that body on Potee Street
the other night.

129
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,800
I'm asking 'cause it was someone
with a Greek-ass name...

130
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,700
and fuck if he wasn't dumped
in front of a house I was using.

131
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,300
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

132
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,300
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

133
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,100
We hit your suppliers.

134
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,400
They cleaned up
and left you holding the dirt.

135
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,500
-Suppliers of what?
-You discussed a drug buy on this tape.

136
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,400
We also have photographs
tying you to your stash house...

137
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,500
and putting you at The Greek's warehouse
over on Newkirk Street for re-ups.

138
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,400
Do yourself a solid here, Mike.

139
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,600
-What's the plan?
-This is just a detention hearing, Frank.

140
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,400
You're not a flight risk,
you have no meaningful priors.

141
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,900
And so far they've only hit you
with one count.

142
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,900
The magistrate's gonna ask us
some basic questions.

143
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,500
Barring anything unforeseen,
you're out in an hour.

144
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,200
-I said nothing to them suits.
-All the better.

145
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,100
-This Eton, he's in charge of what exactly?
-The dope.

146
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,600
He's what, Greek?

147
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,100
He's a Jew.
You know, from that Jew country they got.

148
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,400
-And what about the guy they call Sergei?
-Sergei's straight muscle.

149
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,700
-Look, I need something to eat.
-Okay, what do you want?

150
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,800
Two hot dogs and a strawberry soda.

151
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,700
I'd fuck the order up.

152
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,900
It's gotta be strawberry?

153
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,800
Hook a brother up.

154
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,500
Big man, that ain't gonna work for Omar.

155
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,600
It's all right.

156
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,900
Been what, a year?

157
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Boy, you don't know,
I been dreaming of running into you again.

158
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,100
You got a focus. I give you that.

159
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,200
Man be like that when he got work to do.
You know what I mean?

160
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,900
I think you've done enough.

161
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,900
Bird gone.
Wee-Bey copped out to all them murders.

162
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,400
He in jail now forever and a day.

163
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,700
Stinkum? I mean, you closed the book
on that nigger your damn self.

164
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,500
Avon, he out of pocket for the time being.

165
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,600
Leaving you.

166
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,200
-You looking for closure?
-Lookit, man, ain't no closure.

167
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Not unless Brandon walk up out his grave
and come up in this room right now.

168
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,000
See, all I know is whoever did him that way,
they gets got.

169
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,300
Whoever did him that way,
they still out there right now.

170
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,100
So now you gonna play like
you had nothing to do with it.

171
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,700
No, I can't lie.

172
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,200
I put the motherfucking paper out on y'all.
But y'all was fucking with my stash.

173
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,100
Anything after that, part of the game.

174
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,600
Maybe. But see,
I went past that with Brandon.

175
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,800
That wasn't me. That wasn't Avon, either.

176
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,600
Bird and them were there to see it.
But another man did all the extras:

177
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,900
all that cigarette shit...

178
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
all that bullshit with the eyes.

179
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,100
See now, this man,
he building a rep for himself...

180
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,300
and he wants you bad.

181
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,700
The brutal shit, that's his calling card.

182
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Little bow-tie wearing motherfucker
from out of....

183
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
NYC?

184
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,500
Yeah, small dude.

185
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,800
What he go by?

186
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,800
Brother Mouzone.

187
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,500
I know you heard of him, right?

188
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,100
So if y'all got the mind to go after him...

189
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,300
I might be able to point you
in that direction.

190
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Why?

191
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,200
What happened to your boy was business.

192
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,500
But how that shit happened,
you got the right to take that to heart.

193
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,800
I figure that'll make us even.

194
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,100
Now, you wanna know where this nigger is?

195
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,100
-We need to sit down and talk, Frank.
-I gotta see my son.

196
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,900
The man's right.
Let's grab a cup of coffee or something.

197
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,200
Not now, I need to get clean.

198
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,600
Sergei and them...

199
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,600
they did Mau Mau Willis.

200
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,600
-Why'd they chill him?
-He was welshing on the Jew.

201
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,000
Okay, Sergei's a soldier.
But he and Eton report to somebody.

202
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,600
-Who's above those two, Mike?
-I don't know.

203
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,200
-You don't know?
-Never did wanna know.

204
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,700
God in heaven, Zig,
the cops do that to you?

205
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,700
Ain't the cops.

206
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,500
Lawyers are saying the bail might be tough.

207
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,400
I'm trying.

208
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,900
You know I'm trying, right?

209
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,200
-What happened?
-I don't know.

210
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,500
I got tired.

211
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,100
I got tired of being the punchline
to every joke.

212
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,000
You had problems,
you could've come to me.

213
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,300
You could've said something.

214
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,500
You wouldn't have heard.

215
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,800
You were always too busy
dredging up the canal.

216
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,800
Making sure the right bum got elected.

217
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,300
Buying another round for the house.

218
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,600
I always used to think you were working
all them hours you spent away.

219
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,600
It was all work, Zig, even when it wasn't.

220
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,900
For you, for your mother.

221
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,300
I bet you didn't even tell her
I was in here, did you?

222
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,400
Maybe you did...

223
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,700
and she already took three Nembutals,
sleeping the day away.

224
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,200
-Leave her out of this.
-She's out of it, don't worry.

225
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Pop...

226
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,000
when I seen what I did
to that kid down at the store...

227
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,300
it made me sick to my stomach.

228
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,100
-That ain't you, Zig.
-It ain't?

229
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,300
Because the same blood
don't flow for us, Pop.

230
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,000
I mean, I wish it did, but it don't.

231
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,700
You're more like me than you know.

232
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,300
You're a Sobotka.

233
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,900
Fucked is what I am.

234
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,400
What the fuck can I say?

235
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,900
Best progress so far
is "White Mike" McArdle.

236
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,700
He's standing on the edge of the cliff.

237
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,800
We're gonna get Pearlman in today
to see what she can do to step him off.

238
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,800
Also, we're still hunting
the Sobotka nephew.

239
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,600
Herc and Carver are on that.

240
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,600
Still, my guess is the drug players...

241
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,700
even if they roll, give us Eton and Sergei.

242
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,400
The case gets thin when we get up to this...

243
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,800
Spiros Vondopoulos.

244
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,300
Boy, them Greeks
and those twisted-ass names.

245
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,800
Lay off the Greeks.
They invented civilization.

246
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,700
Yeah? Ass-fucking, too.

247
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,600
What exactly do we know
about Vondopoulos?

248
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,600
We should stay on him, see who he really is.

249
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,200
How about it?

250
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,700
Throw us a few
of your well-equipped surveillance teams?

251
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,700
In case you haven't noticed, Lieutenant,
I'm the only fed still in the room.

252
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,600
The US attorney has what he wants
with the union guys...

253
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,300
which means my field office
is pretty much over this case.

254
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,300
Okay, we're on Vondopoulos ourselves.

255
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,400
I'm sorry for him...

256
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,000
and for you.

257
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,700
We should've paid more attention
to our own.

258
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,200
Like I could've stopped Ziggy
from what he'd done.

259
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,900
Like anyone could ever control him.

260
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,200
I was thinking of my boy, too.

261
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,900
They're dropping the net on all the guys.

262
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,900
Ain't no secret
things get lost in them cans now and again.

263
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,700
He'll be all right.

264
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,500
They tossed my house, Frank.

265
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,800
They don't do that when there's
a couple of cases of vodka missing.

266
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,800
They made me sign the search warrant.
That's a receipt-like for what they found.

267
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,000
Heroin, Frank. From this house.

268
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,600
No, that ain't right. That can't be right.

269
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,500
I knew Nicky and Zig was boosting stuff.
Cameras, shit like that. Nothing like this.

270
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,800
You knew?

271
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,100
And once Nicky got used to boosting stuff
and seeing a little money...

272
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,500
what did you think he was gonna do?
Turn straight all of a sudden and give it up?

273
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,300
No, Frank.

274
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,200
Once you gave him
a taste on the house, just....

275
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,500
That was never.... I mean, he knew. He knew.

276
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,300
Everything I did, the cans I let through...

277
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,000
the money we got from that
went to keeping what we had.

278
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,800
God damn it, Frank!

279
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,100
Don't let that excuse this. Not this.

280
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,400
Uncle Frank, with the big shoulders.

281
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,700
"If it's broke, give it to my uncle.

282
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,300
"He can fix it."

283
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Hey, Killer.
I got something for you, come here.

284
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,400
You got the new Harper's yet?

285
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,000
Now, you know stores down the way...

286
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,000
don't have nothing past Vibe
and Handguns Today.

287
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,800
Some titty mags, too, if you need.

288
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,100
All right. I got you.

289
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,200
I'm gonna hook you up, though, all right?

290
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,900
Hey, boy. Told you I had something for you.

291
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,600
There you go.

292
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,100
That's my good boy.

293
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,700
Good day for a ship.

294
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,900
This is the hiring hall, Frank.
Working stevedores only.

295
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,400
Big Roy, let me have your card.

296
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,900
What do you want my card for?

297
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,700
Not you. Little Big Roy,
let me hold your card.

298
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,900
I need it.
I'm gonna work the Cape St. George today.

299
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,600
-I'll work it for you.
-Work it for me?

300
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,400
I work the ship on your card.
You work a barstool down Clement Street.

301
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,700
End of the week, you get paid.

302
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,100
Hey, Phil.

303
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,700
I'm putting up for the Cape St. George.

304
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,900
I don't see no resemblance.

305
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,400
We're both bald, we're both Polacks.
What the fuck else you need to know?

306
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,100
Who's gonna work for me?

307
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,300
-A different look for our boy.
-Perry Ellis or something.

308
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,700
How would a just-rolled-out-of-bed-looking
motherfucker like you...

309
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,500
know the designer?

310
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,200
Okay, I'm guessing.

311
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,900
It's a Joseph Abboud.

312
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,600
He puts dark buttons instead of brass
on his blazers.

313
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,600
That's the Abboud signature.

314
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,500
You know what they call a guy who pays
that much attention to his clothes, right?

315
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,000
A grown-up.

316
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,300
We're up.

317
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,400
-12-14, let's go.
-Copy, 1 1-34.

318
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,900
-That's a first.
-Sweat from a checker.

319
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,200
-You all right?
-Ready.

320
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,800
Maybe you ought to set up an easel
on the sidewalk...

321
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,700
-and do a sketch instead.
-I'm fine.

322
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,300
-Anything I ought to know?
-Yeah. Use the city.

323
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,400
Windows, mirrors, reflections,
anything like that.

324
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,700
Stay on my frequency, hear?

325
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,400
Vondopoulos should be coming out
of the garage on foot...

326
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,600
-right about now.
-Copy that.

327
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,600
Beadie Russell. She wasn't much
when we started, you know.

328
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,600
But now she's got game.

329
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,800
Thank you.

330
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,000
1 2-14. I got him going into
a fifth floor room.

331
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,400
Note the number
then get down to the lobby.

332
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,200
-Wait on him there.
-Copy.

333
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,800
She's got Vondopoulos in a room.
It could be a while.

334
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,500
Copy.

335
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,700
-All this shit's going out to chassis?
-That's what they tell me.

336
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,700
We need a forklift. We're almost done here.

337
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,200
12-14. Vondopoulos and another man,
middle-aged, blue suit...

338
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,800
Ieaving the front door of the hotel.
They'rejust behind me. Copy?

339
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,900
Copy.

340
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,700
1 1-34.

341
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,800
Subject and companion, blue suit,
leaving the hotel any moment now.

342
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,900
Copy, we got the eyeball.

343
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,200
The man with Vondopoulos
has got to be big.

344
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,800
-I mean, look at that expensive suit.
-Yeah, with them buttons and all.

345
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,900
We leave the Benz here?

346
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,900
It's hot.

347
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,400
They didn't come back to the Benz.
You got them down there?

348
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,700
Negative.

349
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,600
-You about done?
-These nine here still got to be stripped.

350
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,100
-Harder than it looks.
-What ain't?

351
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,300
-You hear how Moonshot got his name?
-Yeah, and I could give a fuck.

352
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Who was the room registered to?

353
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,100
Stephen Rados.
He gave a Northwest D.C. address.

354
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,600
Maybe that's the man with the good tailor.
Maybe not.

355
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,300
We should run out the paper trail
on this guy, see what we turn up.

356
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,600
As to our only tangible piece of progress
from the raids...

357
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,400
what can we do for our friend White Mike?

358
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,400
He rolls on his suppliers,
and he can walk with a long probation.

359
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,000
-And we can move him, if he needs.
-Witness protection?

360
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Why have the feds with you if they're
not gonna step up every now and then?

361
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,700
Wait a second. You're gonna give
a drug dealer a ride like that?

362
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,300
What about Frank Sobotka?

363
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,800
The feds took a shot at him and got nothing.

364
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,300
Or so they tell me.

365
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,400
The way I read it, they cared more
about busting up the union--

366
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,200
Than anything else in the case.
If we came at Frank straight?

367
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,400
You can't make him
any kind of specific offer yourself.

368
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,000
Only I can do that, and only after
I get an okay from my front office.

369
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,700
-She could plant the seed.
-There's no better messenger, Counselor.

370
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,700
Take a shot.

371
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,200
-You going to his house?
-The Union Hall. That's his house.

372
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,200
Thanks for waiting, Brucie. Sorry I'm late.

373
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,400
I shouldn't even be seen with you
at this point.

374
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,800
I just wanna settle our business
while we still can.

375
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,000
It ain't like I'm gonna get my hands
on more cash, obviously.

376
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,000
The grain pier is dead.

377
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:16,100
Half the votes we had lined up
are walking sideways now.

378
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,700
They read the paper, Frank.

379
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,800
So what? So I'm dirty.
The grain pier's still the grain pier, right?

380
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,400
They ain't voting for me, Brucie!
It ain't about me!

381
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,600
I'm not gonna lie.

382
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,300
No one is gonna stand with us
now that the FBI is on you.

383
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,600
-They're scared.
-Of what?

384
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,700
They took the money, Frank.

385
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,800
And now if they deliver the votes,
they figure the feds will be on them, too.

386
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,500
I'm sorry, Frank.

387
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,600
You find a way
of putting this FBI thing to bed...

388
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,400
maybe we can come back the next session
with the grain pier.

389
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,700
You'll have a couple of people down there
knowing they owe you a vote or two.

390
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,800
I don't know what else to say. I don't.
I'm sorry, Frank.

391
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,700
You know what the trouble is, Brucie?

392
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,300
We used to make shit in this country.
Build shit.

393
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,700
Now we just put our hand
in the next guy's pocket.

394
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,800
Come on, you can't eat only olives.
Order something. Lamb or something.

395
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,700
I'm not hungry.

396
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,600
All this trouble.

397
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,300
-So, our associates, they are strong?
-Yes.

398
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,200
I don't worry about our people.
We can try to get them out before the trial.

399
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,400
If not, they will stand for us.

400
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,400
We have shown them too much.
There will be no more trouble.

401
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,500
We must make certain of this.

402
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,700
-Maybe there's another way.
-There is only one sure way.

403
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,100
Hear me out.

404
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,800
If I could guarantee
that Frank Sobotka and his nephew...

405
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,600
would be silent...

406
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500
wouldn't you prefer that?

407
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,000
But you cannot guarantee this.

408
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,500
Frank's son,
the idiot who shot George in his store...

409
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,000
he is going to jail for a long time...

410
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,100
unless....

411
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,500
There was a young clerk wounded that day
in the store.

412
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,200
The prosecutors want to use him
as a witness.

413
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,000
I know his family.

414
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,800
Frank Sobotka will have his son back.

415
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,000
If a man can have this,
why would he talk to the police?

416
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,300
What about Frank's nephew?

417
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,700
He is the idiot's cousin.
He wants the same thing as Frank.

418
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,900
Anyway, I don't worry about Niko.

419
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,400
You are fond of him, Spiros.

420
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,300
You should've had a son.

421
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,300
But then I would've had a wife.

422
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,100
If this maggot doesn't post by midnight,
I'm gonna take it personal.

423
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,700
The shitbird lives in his parents' basement.

424
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,300
Where's a guy like that gonna run?

425
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,000
You wanna go with Auntie Tasha? Come on.

426
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,000
Nice and easy, honey.

427
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,800
-Come here.
-All right, come on, baby.

428
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,900
What's up, big man? Where the party at?

429
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,100
Ain't no party up in here, girl.

430
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,200
We thought Darnell and everybody
was gonna get their smoke on.

431
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,400
Don't you know Darnell?

432
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,900
What's this good boy's name?

433
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,500
Hey, boy.

434
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,900
How you doing today?

435
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,200
You been good? This a good boy.

436
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,300
-There it is.
-Car will be running.

437
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,000
What is it, Lamar?

438
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,300
No need to prolong this.

439
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,700
No, we got time.

440
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,800
-You kill my man?
-No, he's resting.

441
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,900
-I'm saying, ain't you wanna know?
-Not particularly.

442
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,200
About a year ago, a boy name Brandon got
got here in Baltimore.

443
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,700
Stuck and burned before he passed.

444
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,400
-The game is the game.
-Indeed.

445
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,200
See, that boy was beautiful.

446
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,900
Wasn't no need for y'all to do him
the way y'all did.

447
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,400
You feel me?

448
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,000
-A year, you say?
-About that.

449
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,600
You've got some wrong information.

450
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,000
Man, you lying to live.

451
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
I'm at peace with my God.

452
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,600
Do what you will.

453
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,100
So you know?

454
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,400
What happened to your boy,
it's not my style.

455
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,000
The way you bleeding out your back,
looks like that bullet bore clean through.

456
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,000
9 mm at close range will do that.

457
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,500
Emergency. Do you need police
or ambulance?

458
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,400
I wanna report a shooting
over here at the new motel.

459
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,800
-On North Avenue. Room 221 .
-Sir?

460
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,300
My pal, Beatrice.

461
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,400
What, you gonna run me in again?
lsn't that like double jeopardy or some shit?

462
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,300
Stop it, just stop it.

463
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,800
-Talk to me.
-And say what?

464
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,700
I'm sitting here trying to figure it out myself.

465
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,900
It didn't happen overnight.

466
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,900
I knew I was wrong.

467
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,100
But in my head, I thought I was wrong
for the right reasons, you know?

468
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,700
There are different kinds of wrong.

469
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,400
What're you doing here, Bea?

470
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,700
I'd like you to come in. Not in cuffs.

471
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,100
Because you want to.

472
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,800
I'm opening a door here, Frank.

473
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,400
I can't promise you anything.

474
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,700
Just come in. We'll start from there.

475
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,400
You're better than them you got in bed with.

476
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,100
-Our man Vondopoulos didn't come home?
-Maybe he got lucky.

477
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,000
Maybe we didn't.

478
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,400
You think he ditched the Benz
because he picked up the tail?

479
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,000
Nicky from the docks.

480
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,500
If you hadn't called last night,
I'd have never found you.

481
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,400
Relax, Niko, come on.

482
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,100
It's like I told you on the phone.

483
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,400
It is going to be all right.
We can make it all right.

484
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,100
I should have never gone down the road
with you people.

485
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,100
Come on.
You tried to make something of yourself.

486
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,300
There's no harm in that.

487
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,800
And you still have friends.

488
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,500
I'm busted.

489
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,800
So is my uncle and the whole fucking union.
And Ziggy?

490
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,700
-Christ!
-We will be a friend to him, too.

491
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,200
Nothing your people can do about that.
Ziggy's done.

492
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,300
Nothing is done, Niko. Nothing.

493
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,300
Take a look.

494
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,200
That's not your name.

495
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,100
Many names, many passports.

496
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,400
We can do many things.

497
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,400
What can you do for Ziggy?

498
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,300
We ask only loyalty.

499
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:06,000
Why do they need sticks?
Can't they kick it with their feet?

500
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,000
She asked me straight-up to come in,
so I'm here.

501
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,400
First, we need to know
what you're looking for.

502
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,300
We don't want any misunderstandings
later on.

503
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,800
I'm just looking for, you know,
some help with my son.

504
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:26,500
-He can't jail where they got him.
-We move him to a county facility.

505
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,700
-What about my nephew?
-He gets arrested and charged.

506
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,300
But for his cooperation and yours...

507
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,700
we can live with straight probation.

508
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,600
But what we can and cannot do
for you and your family...

509
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,800
-depends on the level of your cooperation.
-You mean, how much I give you?

510
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,900
I got dirt on all of them.

511
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,400
I'll put myself in, too. Whatever you need.
Anything but the union.

512
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:58,300
I ain't putting in no union men.
I'll give you them dead girls in the can.

513
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,700
I'll give you The Greek,
all them sons of bitches...

514
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,100
just to have it off my chest.
Just look to my son and my nephew.

515
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,700
Mr. Sobotka, at this point
I have to advise you...

516
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,200
you need to retain
the services of an attorney.

517
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,600
We're not gonna do this now?

518
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,600
You need to have a lawyer
present in the room.

519
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,500
You have that, we can make this happen
first thing tomorrow.

520
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,800
Mr. Sobotka, I gotta ask.

521
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,800
Why did you stop using your cell phone?

522
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,600
You guys flagged it.
You think I didn't know?

523
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,000
Under the bridge?

524
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,800
It's out in the open.
I guess the cops can't bug it or nothing.

525
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,300
These guys,
they got a big operation to protect.

526
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,000
They're global-like.

527
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,400
-They're really something?
-You got no idea.

528
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,700
I think I got a pretty clear picture
of what they're about.

529
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,100
We ain't talking about a bunch of thieves
rolling drums of olive oil off the docks.

530
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,300
Heroin?

531
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,800
How the fuck did that happen, Nick?
Look at me!

532
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,300
You ain't much more than a kid.

533
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,300
Me, I should've known better.
I put you up with them, for what?

534
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,300
I flushed my fucking family, for what?

535
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,800
You know what that is, Nicky? Do you?

536
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,000
A condominium.

537
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,800
I ain't going down there.

538
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,400
What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna go in and talk with the police.

539
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,900
That's right. I'm gonna do
to those cocksuckers what they did to me.

540
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,100
-You can't do that.
-Why not?

541
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,200
They wanna meet with us on Ziggy.

542
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,600
They can lean on that witness...

543
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,800
that kid that he shot,
the one that was there in the store.

544
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,300
The kid's gonna say that
Double G had the gun.

545
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,200
That it was like self-defense or some shit.

546
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,300
Ziggy could walk, Uncle Frank.

547
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,400
He could.

548
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,000
-And for that they want what?
-Loyalty.

549
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,400
-And for that they want what?
-Loyalty.

550
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,400
Motherfuckers!

551
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,000
I'll hear them out.

552
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,400
-All right, I'll drive.
-No, it's just me.

553
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,000
You ain't dealing with those guys no more.

554
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:25,300
-Uncle Frank, me and Spiros--
-I don't fucking want you with me, Nick!

555
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,700
Go home!

556
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,700
Your way...

557
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,400
it won't work.

558
00:56:46,305 --> 00:57:46,867

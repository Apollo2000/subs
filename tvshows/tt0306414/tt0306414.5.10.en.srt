1
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,275
But if we...

2
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,029
- But how can?
- Jesus Christ.

3
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,295
So this means that...

4
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,878
- What?
- So no one killed any homeless men.

5
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,642
No serial killer.

6
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,777
Some were random killings,

7
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,582
some were natural deaths
that were likely manipulated.

8
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,112
- But they're not linked in any way.
- But why?

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:00,524
The detectives used the money to fund a case
against the drug traffickers responsible

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,221
for the slayings in the vacants a year ago.

11
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:05,026
Last week's arrests and seizures
were a direct result.

12
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,057
So let me just understand this.

13
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,361
So I've been going out there for weeks,

14
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,068
slamming the Governor
for his neglect of the homeless

15
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,770
and declaring how we will stop at nothing

16
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,473
to find the person responsible
for preying on the homeless

17
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:23,710
and all the while...
Hey, Norman, this is my ass here.

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,116
That's true, boss.

19
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,347
But it does have a certain charm to it.

20
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,018
They manufactured an issue to get paid,

21
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:34,720
we manufactured an issue
to get you elected governor.

22
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39,095
Everybody's getting what they need
behind some make-believe.

23
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,795
The detectives involved will be suspended
and ultimately fired, at the least.

24
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:47,000
Beyond that, a criminal prosecution
on fraud and perjury charges is probable.

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,167
You're saying
we call a press conference and we say,

26
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,939
"By the way, all that stuff
about homeless people getting killed

27
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,242
"and the Governor cutting the safety net

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,306
"and us doing everything
in our power to catch the guy,

29
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,753
- "guess what, the joke's on us?"
- Not to mention that the evidence

30
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,053
against the traffickers
arrested last week is tainted.

31
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,184
That case could collapse as well.

32
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,252
I don't fucking believe this.

33
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,022
You two are on point here.

34
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,727
Word of this gets down to Annapolis,
the Governor's gonna wreck me with it.

35
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:18,203
And if it comes to that,
you guys drop on your swords, so help me.

36
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:22,504
How does word not get out
once we suspend the detectives?

37
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,739
Never mind sending it to the grand jury
for a criminal case?

38
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:30,408
The cops that did this, they gotta go. You
cannot be telling me I have to live with this.

39
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,543
Deputy, Counselor...

40
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,078
if you two will excuse us,
we are going to discuss this first

41
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,090
as a matter of public policy.

42
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,149
Until we can reason
the best way to address this,

43
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,754
do nothing and speak to no one
about any of this.

44
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,594
If this becomes public in the wrong way,

45
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,397
a lot of people who were legally responsible
for the situation,

46
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:53,098
good people who were, nonetheless,
in a supervisory role here...

47
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,400
are going to suffer.

48
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,137
And that's not the outcome
that anyone wants.

49
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:03,075
What Mike is saying is that we need to be
very careful about how to proceed.

50
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:17,156
I wish I was still at the newspaper
so I could write on this mess.

51
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,656
It's too fucking good.

52
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,579
Lester. What brings you down?

53
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:18,277
We don't have anything scheduled
from you today, I don't think...

54
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,887
40,000 from the Showboat on the boardwalk.

55
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,917
26 at the Borgata.

56
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,422
80 over the last year at the Taj Mahal

57
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,059
and that's just the Atlantic City casinos.

58
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,900
I like to play. So what?

59
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:41,270
You lost three times your salary
over the last two years.

60
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,608
I ran you through Sentinel Title
and came back with seven pages of liens

61
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,173
and a third mortgage you folded on
two months ago.

62
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,612
Gary, you're done.

63
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,414
What do you mean?

64
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:57,946
We found sealed grand jury papers
in the houses of drug dealers

65
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,981
and we've got people naming you on it.

66
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,820
You have a problem, Gary.

67
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:10,001
But you have friends in this courthouse,
lifelong friends.

68
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:14,234
Cop to the problem, give up the names
of those that bought from you.

69
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,264
Disbarred? Yeah, no doubt.

70
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,376
But you play it clean from this moment on

71
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,172
and we both know you'll probably walk.

72
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,685
- Why did you look at me?
- I ran the finances

73
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,187
on everyone who worked this unit
over the last couple years.

74
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,248
You were the only bogie.
If the S.A.O. Weren't so screwed up,

75
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,021
they'd have been running
background checks as a routine.

76
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,653
But I guess you knew that.

77
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,158
I always wondered
if they'd get their shit together.

78
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,134
But that's Baltimore, isn't it?

79
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,004
So what happens now?

80
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,736
Well, for starters...

81
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,339
you're gonna make a phone call.

82
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:03,015
McNulty, Freamon, Sydnor...

83
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,785
Any one who has the smell
of this on them should be gone.

84
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,952
Before the close of business,
they should be suspended

85
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,393
and, before the end
of the week, indicted.

86
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,556
- I know, but...
- But what?

87
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,794
We're gonna let this shit stand
because it'll hurt Carcetti to air it out?

88
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:18,429
Instead of cleaning house like we need to,
he's up there figuring out how to hide the dirt.

89
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,463
I got a mind to call the Governor myself
and just let it fly.

90
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,941
- Cedric, you can't.
- Why not?

91
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:27,036
If I let this thing stand, I might as well
just roll over and play dead

92
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,070
for every police who knows about this.

93
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,485
- We cover this up...
- Cedric, you can't do anything.

94
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:36,920
Those are your detectives.

95
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,390
They need someone to blame,
they will measure you for it.

96
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,290
I don't give a fuck.

97
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,097
And they'll fire me.

98
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,871
You heard Steintorf.

99
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,969
I was in charge of this thing.

100
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,204
I was on that wiretap.

101
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,113
This is my career.
This is everything.

102
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:13,114
You go public and it hurts Carcetti.

103
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,463
Maybe he doesn't get to be governor
but he is still the Mayor,

104
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,557
and Bond is still my boss,

105
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,068
and you know the weight will not fall on them.

106
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,161
- It never does.
- Christ.

107
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:31,040
Everything I worked for, all those years
in that courthouse...

108
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,679
Please.

109
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,151
25 cents. Baltimore Sun.

110
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,489
Sir, Baltimore Sun. One quarter.

111
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,253
- Keep it.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

112
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,529
People tip pretty good, don't they?

113
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,040
"...paying him for what he had done to us.

114
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,702
"I'm sorry for him, man, really,

115
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,736
"but I still can't let him come up
from the basement."

116
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,917
- You gonna put all that in the paper?
- That's the plan.

117
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,955
Even the parts about Sherrod?

118
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,582
Yeah.

119
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,762
- What good is a story like that?
- Like what?

120
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,767
Like me, Sherrod.
Gettin' high. Not gettin' high.

121
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,462
My sister, all that shit in there.

122
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,835
What good do any of that
do to put it in the newspaper?

123
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,364
People read it, they think about it.
Maybe see things different.

124
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,876
I don't know, man.

125
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,743
Bubs, you don't want me
to do this, I won't do it.

126
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,840
I don't know.

127
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,846
Baltimore Sun. A little bit of sun. Sun paper.

128
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,380
Look, Rupert, go public
with this thing if you want

129
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,485
but your shop is gonna come out looking worse
for letting it happen in the first place.

130
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,519
The better move is to shut it down quietly

131
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,828
and then deal with those responsible
through back channels.

132
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,858
We'll bury these guys softly
and in a hole so deep

133
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,337
no one will ever get close
to digging them up.

134
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,033
I can see that.

135
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,546
Commissioner, do you agree?

136
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,149
Well, it is a little more problematic for me.

137
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,576
The offenders are in my shop,
are they not?

138
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,591
Can I have a word with you in private, Bill?

139
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,525
Hey, if Rawls isn't in, I'm not either.

140
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,032
I wouldn't worry about Bill Rawls.

141
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:38,628
I believe he's about to have
one of those road to Damascus moments.

142
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,530
I can see what you're thinking in there.

143
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,806
I can see the gears grinding
in that head of yours.

144
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,542
You're thinking, "Hey,
I might have some wood on Carcetti here.

145
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,951
"There's no way they can
pin the blame on me for this fiasco

146
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,616
"without doing their boy Daniels, too."
You're thinking we'd have to fire Daniels

147
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,788
to fire you and that wouldn't sit well,
given how much we've already sold Daniels.

148
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,693
Isn't that what you're thinking?

149
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,665
You're telling yourself maybe
there's a way for you to leverage this,

150
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,964
to get yourself a full term as commissioner,

151
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,529
to delay Daniels a few more years
in exchange for you shutting the fuck up

152
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,301
and doing what you're told.

153
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,605
And you know what, Bill?
You're not far off.

154
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,669
You do have a little leverage here
but just a little.

155
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,476
I wouldn't overplay your hand.

156
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,074
How would you play it?

157
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,982
I'd shut the fuck up and wait your turn

158
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,886
and, when Tommy gets to the statehouse,
he brings you with him

159
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,913
to be State Police Superintendent.

160
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:35,222
Because while you may be a shade too white

161
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,252
to run the Baltimore department,

162
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,491
you're just about right for the M.S.P.

163
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,131
- I have your word?
- And I have yours.

164
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,514
Back channel is the way to go.

165
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,682
See? The Police Commissioner
done fell off his ass.

166
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,791
Can I help you?

167
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,026
I need to see Mr. Prezbo.

168
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,068
Someone will come down.

169
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,357
- Are you a student here?
- Ms. Donnelly, it's me, Duquan.

170
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,157
It's good to see you but
you're not a student here

171
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,462
so I can't let you inside.

172
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,026
I just came past to see Mr. Prezbo.

173
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,731
Well, he's teaching right now.

174
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,831
I know. I can wait.

175
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,873
You're gonna have to stay outside.

176
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,368
After the bell, I'll tell Mr. Pryzbylewski
you're out here for him, OK?

177
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,459
I'm going to surprise you with something.

178
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,017
You already have.

179
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:21,059
I got a tip from an informant
about a leak out of the grand jury unit.

180
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,091
Sad to say it's checked out.

181
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,263
- We know about the leak.
- But do you know who it is?

182
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,034
Gary diPasquale.

183
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,643
Decent enough guy but he's got
a bear of a gambling problem

184
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,942
and a bank of drug lawyers
who are willing to pay for their look-sees.

185
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,642
Troy Sanders, Marvin Bronfman,

186
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,709
Dennis Cray, Sid Silverstein.

187
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,551
And the pick of the litter? Maurice Levy.

188
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,187
I kid you not.

189
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,887
Gary is their leak?

190
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:52,864
He broke right away.
He was ready to give it up. Needed to.

191
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,234
One-party consent call
implicating Maury Levy.

192
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,764
- Where's Gary now?
- He went up to the second floor

193
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:04,037
to hand in his letter of resignation
and went home to wait for the sword to drop.

194
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,204
He's OK, he's better than you'd think.

195
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:13,181
You know, if we can turn Levy
and some of these other drug lawyers,

196
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,881
we can route the drug money all over town.

197
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,188
It's sad business, I know,

198
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,557
but at least we know the truth now, right?

199
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,491
The truth, you say?

200
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,333
Duquan, hello.

201
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,807
Snatch-pops.

202
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,276
Damien. You lost your mind?

203
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,938
- But I said snatch-pops.
- I don't care.

204
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,538
You're gonna buy him a new sandwich,

205
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,414
and past that, you're gonna ask
Mr. Williams for a broom

206
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,884
to clean that up, you understand?

207
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,015
Right now or you're mine
for another week of detention.

208
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,853
I don't want to hear another word.

209
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,796
It looks like you got the hang of it.

210
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,931
What's up with you?

211
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,127
Ain't nothing.

212
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,999
You still at Southwestern?

213
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,495
Well, I'm, like, needing a semester off,
you know?

214
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,505
I'm outdoors now.

215
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,909
And...

216
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,314
I was hoping maybe I could get with you

217
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,877
and borrow some money,
so I can get a place and some clean clothes

218
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,788
and get myself settled
so I can go back to school.

219
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,422
You're on the street?

220
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,019
I got people ready
to give me a really good place

221
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,155
if I can come up
with some money for it.

222
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,999
How much do you need?

223
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,766
Couple of hundred.

224
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,534
But if you could go one fifty more,

225
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:45,703
I can enrol in the G.E.D. Program
down B.C.C.C.,

226
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,542
then I could get my G.E.D.
Without having to go back to Southwestern.

227
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,571
Then I can get my work permit.

228
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,076
I don't think you're eligible
for a G.E.D. Program

229
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,748
if you're still of age to attend high school.

230
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,185
Yeah, you are.

231
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,023
I'll tell you what.

232
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,861
Give me a couple minutes,
I'll drive you down there.

233
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,164
If you are eligible, I'll write a check
right to the bursar's office.

234
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,136
No, Mr. P., you ain't got to go through all that.

235
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,140
Besides, I ain't got the time
to go down there today.

236
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,074
But, you know, I'm gonna.

237
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,377
I can do it, if that's what you want.

238
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,881
And I don't even care about the money.

239
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,582
But understand I'm gonna go down
to B.C.C.C. In a few days

240
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,613
and find out if you're enrolled.

241
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,422
And if you are, I'm gonna say, "Great.

242
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,624
"Duquan can come past
with his certificate when he gets it,

243
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,894
"and we're still friends.

244
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,924
"And he can still rely on me."

245
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,562
But if you aren't enrolled, then...

246
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,968
Well, I imagine I'm not gonna see you again,
am I?

247
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,137
No, Mr. P.

248
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,646
I'm definitely gonna enroll.

249
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,342
You'll see.

250
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,847
I'll get my stuff.
I'll meet you in the lot

251
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,084
and we'll go find a bank machine.

252
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,023
Jay, all I'm saying is we've run down
all the leads we had,

253
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,159
all the office reports are in and, at this point,

254
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,466
barring any new developments,
I don't need all this fucking manpower.

255
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,837
Fuck me, Jimmy.
Last week you were crying

256
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,104
for every swinging dick
you could get your hands on.

257
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,509
The case has gone quiet.
There's no red ribbons,

258
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,035
no bodies, no disappearances.

259
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,708
Not a fucking word on the cellphone.
This thing's useless.

260
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,546
You don't want the wiretap either, now?

261
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:36,179
The judge gave us 60 days.
Once that runs out, then...

262
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,553
Motherfucker, you were the one
who was all semper fi

263
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,058
for this serial killer
and now you're fuckin' the dog.

264
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,186
I'm ready to work the case.

265
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,493
But short of any new leads,
what the fuck do you want me to do?

266
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,363
I can't make shit up, can I?

267
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,899
It is what it is.

268
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,872
If I send the surveillance teams back,

269
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,070
don't come crying for more
manpower tomorrow, you hear?

270
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,009
Shit is like a war, ain't it?

271
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,378
Easy to get in, hell to get out.

272
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:27,062
Pearlman knows everything. Daniels, too.
They figured it out.

273
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,404
- How?
- I don't know.

274
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,377
- Jesus. What are they?
- I don't know.

275
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:37,513
She made it clear there are not to be
any further homeless killings.

276
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,540
Nothing more on this case whatsoever.

277
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:44,147
- Does she know about Marlo, that our case?
- She knows everything. Daniels knows.

278
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,958
They went to the E.C.U.,
dialed up the wiretap number

279
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,655
and up pops Marlo's cellphone.

280
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,221
Why aren't we fired?
Why aren't we in fucking bracelets?

281
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,892
I don't know.

282
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,498
Oh shit, Lester.

283
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,262
We gotta get outta here.
We gotta think this thing through.

284
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,797
Jesus fucking Christ.

285
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:07,141
Look, meet me down at Kavanagh's
in ten minutes, all right?

286
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,575
How much?

287
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,817
200.

288
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,984
Damn, boy. Teacher must love your black ass.

289
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:58,395
C'mon with it. They gonna put out testers
up on Poplar Grove.

290
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,125
We gonna be late for it.

291
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,707
C'mon, boy. C'mon.

292
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,854
Deputy.

293
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,385
To be continued.

294
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,987
- Fuck, fuck, fucking fuck.
- What's the matter?

295
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,658
Cottage cheese for lunch
again there, Carl?

296
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,733
Just because it happened
doesn't mean it's news.

297
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,968
There's always a salmonella outbreak
somewhere.

298
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,034
I don't see why we have to cover this one...

299
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,375
What's the first rule of rewrite, Spry?

300
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,381
Shoot it down.

301
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,440
Did you read this?

302
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,420
We are crediting our own coverage

303
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,184
with changing the Governor's mind?

304
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,691
I'm already to the jump

305
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,750
and there's not a quote from anyone

306
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,853
crediting us with anything of the sort.

307
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,830
The guv is restoring funding, all right.

308
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:43,266
That's 'cause Carcetti's been beating the shit
out of him on this issue.

309
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,963
We're just an afterthought.

310
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,267
Whiting can smell the public service Pulitzer?

311
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,706
- Seems so.
- You get a chance yet?

312
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,005
Yeah, yeah. I read it.

313
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,602
And?

314
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,247
Beautiful.

315
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,772
No, no, no. I mean it.

316
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,547
You got some real Joe Mitchell
stuff on the page there.

317
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:04,487
Really makes me feel like
I know this guy and his world.

318
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,889
You just pulled it all through the keyhole.

319
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,051
Thanks, Gus.

320
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,994
We get some good art,
I'm gonna push for the Sunday front.

321
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,327
Well, I gotta make sure
the guy is good with it.

322
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,525
What do you mean?

323
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,090
The part of the story
about the kid bothers him.

324
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,125
When he told me about it,
he was just talking...

325
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,933
You told him you were
writing about him?

326
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,531
I know, but...
I'm putting the guy's life out there.

327
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,702
I wanna feel clean about it.
You know what I'm sayin'?

328
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,439
I remember clean.

329
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:33,450
Obviously, they're not in a hurry to go public
'cause we ain't cuffed.

330
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,921
They're pretending on this case
like we're pretending. Why?

331
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,816
Carcetti. He's exposed on this.

332
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,159
How? Just blame it all on us,
on the department.

333
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,563
To kill us, they'd have to kill Rawls, Daniels

334
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,829
and half the chain of command.
And he made those guys.

335
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,699
It's his police department.

336
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:55,571
So he opens himself up
right when he's out there, running for governor.

337
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,008
So they want us to do what?
Run it down quietly? That's no problem.

338
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,070
Six months from now, after the election,

339
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,639
they might decide to open up
and grand jury us.

340
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,174
We could still go to jail and, if not,

341
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,814
I expect to be back in the pawn shop unit
and you are gonna ride the boat.

342
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,949
So what? It was worth it.

343
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,087
Wasn't it?

344
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,289
Depends.

345
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,231
Are they gonna let the case against Marlo
and his people stand,

346
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,995
knowing what they know?

347
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,730
Why wouldn't they? It still works
on the seizures and cellphones.

348
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,968
- It works without the illegal tap.
- Yeah, it does.

349
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:31,407
And they made a big deal
about dropping Marlo.

350
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,173
They called that press conference
and linked him to all the bodies.

351
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,407
For them to drop the case now...

352
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,611
You know, you think about it,

353
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,643
we've got almost as much
on them as they do on us.

354
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:45,649
That Tom Wolfe wannabe

355
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,454
thinks he's gonna
get a phrase like that past me?

356
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,518
No fuckin' way, motherfucker.

357
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,727
It's like a sweater with
the threads hanging off.

358
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,796
Pull any thread...

359
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,570
Mostly exaggerations and too-perfect quotes,

360
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,099
sometimes on the record.

361
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,635
I called some of them back,

362
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,240
asked if they really said those things.

363
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,342
You know what the city
housing commissioner told me

364
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,478
about the quotes in the flipping story?

365
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,513
He wished he'd said some of them
but that he'd never been that smart in his life.

366
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:23,059
Someone takes the time to...

367
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,119
re-report this stuff, it'll get ugly.

368
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,990
What're you gonna do?

369
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,558
I don't know, Robert. I don't know.

370
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,265
Keep my name out of it.

371
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,274
No bail.

372
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,253
They're claiming a propensity for violence
and witness intimidation at the bail review,

373
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,982
trying to have you held as the kingpin.

374
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,149
- They can do that?
- They can try.

375
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,250
Depends on which judge they draw.

376
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:59,891
So they ain't got no bail for Chris, right?
I mean, he got the murder one.

377
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,296
Monk neither.

378
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,234
Too much weight in his car
and he's on parole from the '04 charge.

379
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,136
Best I could do was spring
Mr. Wagstaff on 300,000.

380
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,106
- He show that kind of money?
- Put up his uncle's house

381
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,008
on surety bond for a third of it.
Bondsman is fronting the rest on a fake lien.

382
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:20,016
Right now, the important thing is not bail,
the important thing is this...

383
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,849
I need you to tell me
who else knew your clock code.

384
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,480
I told you.

385
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,152
Me, Cheese, Monk, Chris

386
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,923
- and the supply. That's it.
- No one else?

387
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,522
No one else even had my cell number,
except you.

388
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,128
What?

389
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,571
- There's a lie in here somewhere.
- I ain't lying.

390
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,575
I don't mean you.

391
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,100
Look, the police say the source told them

392
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,840
that you were re-upping on the day

393
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,371
and word of that might have
slipped out. That's possible.

394
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,577
If you were wholesaling all over town...

395
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:57,850
They only grab your cells when they arrest you
and then they have to go get warrants

396
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,221
before they can look at
the photos on the phones.

397
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,317
And it's only when they get to the photos

398
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,760
and break the code that they have enough

399
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,424
to type a charging document
for you or Chris, right?

400
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,490
I mean, you aren't caught with drugs.

401
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:15,169
But they had the arrest warrants on both of you
within a couple hours.

402
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,937
Which means that they broke
the code almost instantly,

403
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,376
no time at all.

404
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,541
They wiretapped me.

405
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,175
My investigator thinks so.

406
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,947
But he doesn't know for sure
which unit ran the tap or who manned it.

407
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,949
It doesn't add up.

408
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,689
You gettin' out.

409
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,598
You ain't.

410
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:47,862
You hit the streets, you round up
as much muscle as possible

411
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,897
and get that boy.

412
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,875
He did Snoop 'cause he knew we was on him.

413
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,243
He knew we was on him 'cause
he the one talked about the re-up.

414
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,980
Get your shit together, man.

415
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,883
The bondsman came in with Levy.

416
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,521
A'ight. I'm on it.

417
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,092
Man, you got a dollar?

418
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,931
C'mon.

419
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,061
Pal.

420
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,030
Pal, you all right?

421
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,739
OK, here it comes,

422
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,075
the dreaded crab claw.

423
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:04,348
You know what happens
when crab claw goes...

424
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,883
- It's all crab tonight...
- No crab claw!

425
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,944
Yes, crab claw!

426
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,821
Yeah! Crab claw does it again. Six!

427
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,491
Six and I'm out...

428
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,227
Yeah.

429
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,758
Where?

430
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,394
You're fucking kidding me.

431
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,496
It's more bull...

432
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,507
It's bogus, Jay. I'm telling you...

433
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,175
OK.

434
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,110
I gotta go.

435
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,153
I have to keep running the string out.
I've no choice.

436
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,213
You said the bosses know.

437
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:50,220
Some do, some don't. The ones that do
want us to keep pretending.

438
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,161
We stop pretending, then...

439
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,399
Listen, we'll finish this tomorrow night, OK?

440
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,799
I'll see you in a bit.

441
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,444
What do you think?

442
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,213
I mean, puttin' my shit in the streets?

443
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,988
Well, it's you.

444
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,359
He's got you.

445
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,124
Yeah, well.

446
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,132
I mean he's got what you're about.

447
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,900
The guy likes you,
that shows through.

448
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,667
I mean, you know, he's saying
this giving back that you're doing,

449
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,403
he's putting that up against Sherrod.

450
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,707
He ain't lettin' you
off the hook for shit

451
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,714
but he's just puttin' it all out there.

452
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,739
You know, the good and the bad.

453
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,684
You know what?

454
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,754
The bad don't bother me to have out there.

455
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,351
Shit, I know the bad.
I ain't lyin' to no one about the bad.

456
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,919
Scared of somebody callin' you good?

457
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:04,758
A lot of folks volunteer places.
A lot of folks share at meetings.

458
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,000
Plenty of motherfuckers wake up every day
and not get high.

459
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,668
Man makin' me sound special
for doin' what the fuck I need to be doin'.

460
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,975
Read it.

461
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,258
"You can hold back
from the suffering of the world,

462
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,284
"you have free permission to do so

463
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,762
"and it is in accordance with your nature.

464
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,830
"But perhaps this very holding back

465
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,461
"is the one suffering you could have avoided."

466
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,233
Fran-zee Kafka.

467
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,465
Who's he?

468
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,601
Some writer.

469
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,577
You read his books?

470
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,172
Fuck no. But you remember Flubber?

471
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:54,547
He handed that to me
the night that he had me start leading

472
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,577
the Saint Martin meeting.

473
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,749
I kept it ever since.

474
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,925
What it mean to you?

475
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,528
You want these?

476
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:12,297
Yeah, my man say he need it back
and not to make any copies.

477
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:17,270
He say he ain't supposed to show it to me
before it goes in the paper.

478
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,037
I mean, if I let him.

479
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,669
You gonna?

480
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,340
Thanks for the crabs.

481
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,323
Gray van.

482
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:37,394
- You get the tag?
- I couldn't see it from where I was.

483
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,760
Describe the driver.

484
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:41,560
White. Six foot.

485
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,863
Not heavy, not skinny either.

486
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,866
Clothes?

487
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,872
Nothing I noticed. Kinda nondescript.

488
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,101
Nondescript?

489
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:53,668
I was surprised, I guess. I just thought,
"Whoa, what's he doing?"

490
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,043
- Funny it being you to see this.
- It's weird.

491
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,846
If an interview doesn't run late,
I'm not even here tonight.

492
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,352
You mind if I get inside?
I gotta check in with my desk.

493
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,514
You need anything else,
you got my number.

494
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,284
Yeah.

495
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,062
That guy's an asshole.

496
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,292
This smokehound can't remember a thing.

497
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,198
Only motherfucker
he remembers messing with him

498
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,668
is the fella that found him.

499
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:22,002
Whatever happened before that
is anyone's guess.

500
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:28,334
Someone try to kidnap you,
drag you into a van?

501
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,280
- OK.
- Who was trying to hurt you?

502
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:34,046
My father. But he was a drunk.

503
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,782
Detective, there's a vagrant over here
says he saw something.

504
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,453
What did you see, fella?

505
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,991
McNulty?

506
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,232
- Johnny Weaver. Tactical.
- Fuck you. Why didn't you say so?

507
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,263
J.W. Tryin' to keep your cover?

508
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,765
It's better if everyone here
thinks I'm one of the regulars.

509
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,574
Anyway, what's the ruckus with Petey?

510
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,341
- The drunk?
- Yeah.

511
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,046
Sun reporter says he's going into his building,

512
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,747
he sees a guy trying to drag him
into a gray van.

513
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:13,154
- It's bullshit, right?
- Yeah. Petey was laying there 45 minutes

514
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,160
before that preppy cocksucker
even parks his car.

515
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,718
- Thanks.
- No problem.

516
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,525
Gimme a dollar, make it look right.

517
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,799
Thank you, Jimmy.

518
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,205
What about the reporter? You could charge
false statement, you know.

519
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,773
You lock up every liar, there's no room
in B.D.C. For anyone else, right?

520
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,747
More trouble than it's worth.

521
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,182
Jay, it's horseshit. I'm going home.

522
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,049
Yeah.

523
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,888
Brought home some crabs.

524
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,920
I already made dinner.

525
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:29,694
Put 'em in the fridge.
Cold for lunch tomorrow, if you like.

526
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,531
I can't eat 'em all.

527
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,939
We don't run this shit,
especially not off the front.

528
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:50,317
- I saw what I saw.
- Alma is on the phone with police P. I.O.

529
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,345
And they are telling us on the record and off

530
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,359
that they are discounting any report
of a possible abduction.

531
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,226
That doesn't mean they're doing their job,
and it doesn't mean we...

532
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,390
Our job is to report the news,
not to manufacture it.

533
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,899
Fuck you, Gus.

534
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,997
Nice.

535
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,371
I know they're jealous of how much play
his stories get but the truth is...

536
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,178
We cannot run this shit.

537
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:23,053
Are you suggesting
that Scott made any of this up?

538
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,418
You ever notice that the guys who do that,

539
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,894
the Blairs, the Glasses, the Kelleys,

540
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,828
they always start
with something small,

541
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:36,595
just a little quote that they clean up.
And then it's a whole anecdote,

542
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,569
and, pretty soon, they're seeing
some amazing shit.

543
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,572
They're the lucky ones
who just happen to be standing

544
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:46,202
on the right street corner in Tel Aviv
when the pizza joint blows up

545
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,542
and the human head rolls down the street
with the eyes still blinking.

546
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:51,980
The pictures were sent to him.
The police have confirmed...

547
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:55,452
It always starts with something true,

548
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,386
something confirmed.

549
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,116
But then you've got a son of a bitch

550
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,785
who just happens to be walking
in the Guilford entrance

551
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,453
when the mysterious gray van comes...

552
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:07,294
Gus, this has gotten personal
between you and Scott

553
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,322
and it's affecting your judgment.

554
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,233
I'm moving the story through the state desk.

555
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,034
You should go home, think this through.

556
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,501
We'll talk in the morning.

557
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,281
Maybe you win a Pulitzer with this stuff

558
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,121
and maybe you gotta give it back.

559
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,782
It's in my notes, Gus.
Everything that happened,

560
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,987
everything that guy said when I got to him.

561
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,520
Every last word is in my notes.

562
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,482
Home earlier than I thought.

563
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,047
Yeah. Home.

564
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,269
- He hit again.
- Who did?

565
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,401
The serial killer.

566
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,139
Get a grip, motherfucker.

567
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,046
You don't believe me?
Check out his left wrist.

568
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,579
You fuckin' with me again, Bunk?

569
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,183
Copycat.

570
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,594
Call McNulty. Get him down here.

571
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:58,738
Been going over the charging documents
on the Partlow-Stanfield drug arrests.

572
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:02,337
- Problematic to say the least.
- How so?

573
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,007
They grab the phones and, minutes later,

574
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:07,108
they've cracked an elaborate code
that implicates everyone.

575
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,119
No one's that brilliant,

576
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,780
not at the B.P.D., anyway.

577
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,850
You don't know Lester Freamon.

578
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:16,018
I know what I know.

579
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,722
And this feels to me like an illegal wiretap.

580
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,558
Your guys were on those phones,
tracking my clients

581
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,625
- long before they went near any drugs.
- Untrue.

582
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,097
We get into discovery
and I'm going to have no problem

583
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,506
knocking down that bullshit
about a source of information.

584
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:35,205
And my sources around here tell me that,
with all the budget cutbacks,

585
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,737
the only wiretap
you all have had up this year

586
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,273
has been on the homeless killer thing.

587
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:43,217
Whatever else you're running is illegal.

588
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,750
Sources?

589
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,224
Title threes are supposed to be secret.

590
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,689
Are you saying you have a source
of information inside the courthouse?

591
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,721
It's a figure of speech.

592
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,496
What I'm saying is that
there's shit in the blood of your case,

593
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,232
and, if you wait until this goes past indictments,

594
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,069
I'm gonna run wild with it.

595
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,438
We should talk.

596
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,001
Out of court.

597
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:12,949
Fuck me.

598
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,353
Is it enough? Do you have enough?

599
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:20,016
It has to be. It should be.

600
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:22,218
You can't look at everything
that Robert found,

601
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:25,319
at the pattern, and not see
what this fucking guy's about.

602
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,354
You know that. I know that.

603
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,424
What, you don't think so?

604
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,333
I think that if you do this,

605
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,463
these son of a bitches will do you.

606
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,431
Come.

607
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,069
Sorry. There's been another homeless murder.

608
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,806
South Baltimore.

609
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,009
Careful, Gus.

610
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,041
I can't protect you.

611
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,224
- No fucking way.
- Dead for a while.

612
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,826
And I can assume, Jimmy,
from the fact that the ribbon ain't red

613
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,963
and the fact that you don't need another body
because Marlo is locked up...

614
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:12,499
- I got nothing to do with this.
- Wonderful. We've eliminated one suspect.

615
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,033
You see what you started here?

616
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,808
The bosses are gonna toss it
back to you. No doubt.

617
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,179
- The bosses know it's bullshit.
- What?

618
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:22,549
- Daniels knows. Pearlman, too.
- How the fuck you?

619
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,054
- How much longer does this...
- Can you give us a minute?

620
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,993
You turning the world
upside down with your bullshit.

621
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,893
- How are you not in jail?
- I don't know.

622
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,989
The lie's so big, people can live with it.

623
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:40,493
Jesus fucking Christ, Jimmy. I told you.
I fuckin' told you it was going to come to this.

624
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:45,709
You played with fire, didn't you?
And now we're all getting burned...

625
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,837
...reporting live from South Baltimore,
where police have found the body

626
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,212
of what appears to be
another homeless man.

627
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:55,616
This one killed and left in a vacant lot...

628
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,053
...short while ago have refused so far...

629
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,953
Did somebody not get the message?

630
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:42,091
You're not killing them yourself, McNulty,
at least assure me of that.

631
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,171
And the one you disappeared?

632
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,271
He's OK, last I checked.

633
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:55,438
Good. That's a start, I guess.

634
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,971
- I thought you got a message.
- Copycat.

635
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,774
I got nothing on this one.

636
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,411
Jesus.

637
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:07,049
How did you do it?
How did you get 'em by the medical examiner?

638
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:10,219
Some were real and I just linked 'em
with the ribbons.

639
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,092
Some I juked as strangle jobs.

640
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:18,033
- If it matters, I know now...
- Fuck what you know now.

641
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:22,402
This was all for money, McNulty?
You couldn't live without the O. T?

642
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:25,306
The Stanfield case. It was that.

643
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:28,334
I know where it went,
but you got paid, too.

644
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,576
You and Freamon
and maybe a dozen other guys.

645
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,606
It wasn't about the money.

646
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,327
Down the road, when we settle on this,

647
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,625
and we will settle on this,

648
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:50,862
I don't expect any of you will ever see
another hour of O.T. Again.

649
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,496
I don't expect any of you
will be doing police work ever again.

650
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:57,268
And the only reason this isn't before
a grand jury right now

651
00:42:57,308 --> 00:43:00,175
is because our mayor can't live with that.

652
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,874
Oh, yeah.
The Mayor knows your name.

653
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:08,476
So this is your last case. Work it.

654
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,612
If you're half the detective you think you are,

655
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:13,782
you'll put this one down fast
and take us all off the hook.

656
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:15,815
The longer this goes on,

657
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,850
the worse the payback's gonna be.

658
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,573
But what does he really know?

659
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:41,346
What he knows now isn't half
of what he'll learn when we get to discovery.

660
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,445
They won't be able to produce
a credible source of information.

661
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:48,117
They don't have to if it's not a registered C. I.
A source is only...

662
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,353
If he can raise doubts in a judge's mind,

663
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,692
we could be compelled to reveal our source.

664
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,925
At that point, we're giving up the wiretap.

665
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,160
And he gets the paperwork
from the phone company.

666
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,192
Which has Stanfield's number on it.

667
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,962
God.

668
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:05,303
The only thing we can do is barter.

669
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,173
Then barter. This can't go to court.

670
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,769
We do have some leverage.

671
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,578
What?

672
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:16,418
Let's just say Mr. Levy has problems
of his own to deal with.

673
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,646
Make this go away...

674
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,986
and the Mayor will not forget that you did so.

675
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,856
Nor will I.

676
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:30,933
Jimmy, ass up an' help us with this.

677
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,334
Shit is funky.

678
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:42,705
- We should take this into the box.
- Where's the pocket contents?

679
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:46,182
We have questions
about the reported kidnapping...

680
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,411
- Those two bags there.
- Yes, ma'am.

681
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,788
Well, that would seem
to be the newspaper's problem.

682
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:56,752
I get another fucking call about a gray van,

683
00:44:56,794 --> 00:45:00,195
I'm burning that fucking newspaper building
to the ground.

684
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,696
What?

685
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,169
Your homeless guy from days ago,
what was in his pockets?

686
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:12,437
- Bullshit.
- You got business cards?

687
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,137
Yeah, but every card has an alibi.

688
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:16,840
- Let me see.
- I thought we were done with this.

689
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,449
So, where you going with this?

690
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:34,993
- I think it's down.
- Motherfucker, you ain't that good.

691
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,065
McNulty, what's up with this?

692
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,135
You OK, Gus?

693
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,673
Yeah, I'm good.

694
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,711
What?

695
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,153
Alma, what's up?

696
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,691
- It's empty.
- What's empty?

697
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:11,462
The pad he waved at you,
saying it was all filled with notes.

698
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,604
It's empty. Every page.

699
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,236
Thanks.

700
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:41,057
What the fuck is that about?

701
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,905
Alma, TV has police on a sweep
of the homeless

702
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,468
under Hanover street.

703
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,783
I'll get right to the point.

704
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,414
Please do.

705
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:13,963
- You have Stanfield, right? He's your client?
- Yeah, him and his people.

706
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,794
I have some stuff,
straight from the grand jury

707
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,393
that you're gonna wanna
see sooner rather than later.

708
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:21,233
- Is this a title three case?
- You'll find it interesting, I promise.

709
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:24,934
- All right. When can you meet?
- Tomorrow, after work. Same money, right?

710
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,136
- Yeah, the money's the same.
- Good.

711
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:33,349
We can grand jury
Gary diPasquale tomorrow,

712
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:36,147
along with that one-party consent call.

713
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,312
Or...

714
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,517
here's the deal.

715
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,083
No court trials.

716
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:47,460
Partlow pleads to all of the bodies
in the vacants and takes life, no parole.

717
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:51,024
We'd want the second shooter, too,
but Pearson's beyond that now.

718
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:54,526
Metcalf and Wagstaff plead
to possession with intent.

719
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,801
Stanfield takes ten years on conspiracy.

720
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:01,404
You're blackmailing an officer of the court.

721
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:04,903
The moment you came in here
and offered that quid pro quo,

722
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,382
you were guilty of obstruction of justice.

723
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,282
You're right.

724
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,980
I could get six to eight years.

725
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:18,190
And for bribery of a state's attorney
and the violation of grand jury secrecy,

726
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,991
you could see ten to twelve.

727
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:24,667
I'll be out a couple years before you.

728
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,499
You come home,
first round's on me, I guess.

729
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:31,166
So you'll let me walk
to keep this case out of open court?

730
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:34,371
That file must be dirty as hell.

731
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,346
The conspiracy charge on Stanfield falls
without the cellphones

732
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:40,043
and you and I both know
that if someone does some digging,

733
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,575
they're gonna find an illegal wiretap
and you're gonna lose the phones.

734
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,088
Everhart, 274,

735
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:49,650
Maryland 459, Ceccolini, 435,

736
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,354
US, 268.

737
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,026
Lying cops don't automatically kill a case.

738
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,125
But that's a lot of risk on appeal.

739
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,330
And a lot of dirt for your office to show.

740
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,473
No. You're scared of the light.

741
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:09,840
Partlow takes his chances
on the legit murder charge only.

742
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:14,014
The conspiracy count goes
and Stanfield and the rest walk.

743
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,715
Stanfield walks

744
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:20,780
but the case goes on the stet docket,
not dismissed outright.

745
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:23,258
And, although I can tell you
there are people in this city

746
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,955
who can't tolerate a scandal
at this particular moment,

747
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,021
that dynamic changes after November.

748
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:30,260
- The elections.
- After November,

749
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,134
no one is going to care
as much about showing dirt.

750
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,630
If Carcetti wins, he's in Annapolis.

751
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:39,403
If he loses, he's an incumbent mayor
who can take a hit or two.

752
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:43,846
So tell Mr. Stanfield that this is
his only window.

753
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,645
Partlow pleads to all the murders

754
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:50,585
and both lieutenants plead to the drugs.

755
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,088
Then Stanfield retires.

756
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,715
He's done.

757
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:57,955
We even get the scent of him
on the street ever again,

758
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,623
this case comes off stet and goes to trial.

759
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:04,261
And if we have to put a few cops in jail
right behind him, so be it.

760
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,462
We'll bring the evidence and take a hit.

761
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:09,598
Your client walks away now...

762
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,503
or the both of you don't walk at all.

763
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:39,697
Let's go. Get up.

764
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,678
That's mine.

765
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,753
It's yours. I know.

766
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,200
Do you have a card?

767
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,013
That's not a card.

768
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,783
We met before, d'you remember?

769
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,517
Liar.

770
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,222
Black liar.

771
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:40,020
Why'd you kill your friend?

772
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,658
He drinks.

773
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,499
He's always drinking.

774
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,233
But you put a ribbon around his wrist.

775
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,002
Like the others.

776
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,673
- Yeah.
- Did you see that on television?

777
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:58,873
The ribbon on the wrist?

778
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:01,110
Did you hear about that from other people?

779
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,882
Why'd you do the thing with the ribbon?

780
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,911
Nobody understands.

781
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:09,849
You don't understand.

782
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,721
I always know what I'm going to do...

783
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,462
before I do it. OK?

784
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,068
I always know what I'm going to do.

785
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:25,131
Did you kill the others?
Did you kill all of them?

786
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:27,143
Every one of them.

787
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,709
I did it because I knew I was going to do it.

788
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:40,947
I've killed millions.

789
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:45,160
OK? And they all killed me.

790
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,155
So you did all the murders?

791
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:55,227
You're a coward.

792
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:59,236
I can tell.

793
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,402
Do you have a card?

794
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:12,950
Jimmy, reporter's in there waiting
for a photo array.

795
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,618
What? Jay, he's bullshit.

796
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,124
I know he is but the newspaper
made such a fuss,

797
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:23,257
the major wants us to jerk him off,
just to say we did.

798
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,008
Hey, detective.

799
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,025
No gray van either.

800
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,555
- What?
- He doesn't have a gray van.

801
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:09,036
No gray van. And he didn't call you
on the phone either, did he?

802
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:13,641
He didn't call you the first time
and he didn't call you the second. I did that.

803
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:17,645
Yew mortify me in fronta my fatha...

804
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:19,416
And those pictures you got.

805
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:20,946
I took those.

806
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,687
And the missing guy?
He's my second cousin.

807
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:27,527
We sent him up to Atlantic City
with a roll of quarters.

808
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,759
And you know why I can tell you all this?

809
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:31,733
Because, you lying motherfucker,

810
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,328
you're as full of shit as I am.

811
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:37,932
And you've got to live with it and play it out
for as long as it goes. Right?

812
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:40,871
Trapped in the same lie.

813
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:44,979
Only difference is I know why I did it.

814
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:48,416
But fuck if I can figure out
what it gets you in the end.

815
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,442
But hey, I ain't part of your tribe.

816
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,387
- You're not serious? You can't...
- No.

817
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:56,348
No, I'm a fucking joke.

818
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,458
And so are you.

819
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,697
Now get the fuck out of here.

820
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:43,766
You walk.

821
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:48,232
Chris eats the murders, every last one,
takes life without parole.

822
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:50,007
- No parole?
- No shot.

823
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,241
They've got him cold on the one
with the D.N.A.

824
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,011
Can you sell that? Is Chris loyal?

825
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,711
Yeah.

826
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,151
As long as I take care of his people.

827
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,647
Cheese and Monk are looking
at up to twenty for the drugs.

828
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:06,924
But there's gonna be no assets investigation
and you come home with all your money.

829
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,196
Why they letting me walk?

830
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:13,100
They don't wanna
but there's some shit in their case

831
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,400
and they'd rather not show it in court.

832
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:19,033
But here's the rub.
If you stay in the game,

833
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:21,009
they will. They definitely will.

834
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,308
Right now, with an election going on,

835
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,314
they're willing to give you a bye.

836
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:29,045
But after November, if they even think
you're still a player,

837
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:31,110
they can take this case down off the shelf

838
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:34,555
and the shit in the case might not be enough
to keep you free.

839
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:37,159
You understand?

840
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,184
Give up the crown.

841
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,697
Well, that's the deal, kiddo.

842
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,561
There's not a lawyer
who could get better for you.

843
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,909
How'd that go, boss?

844
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:08,981
Kiddo, you are a gold mine to me.
You know that?

845
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:11,323
You've taken this law firm
to a whole new level.

846
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:14,091
- Me?
- You don't tip me to that bad wiretap,

847
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:17,531
I've got all kinds of trouble.
But now, if Marlo takes the deal,

848
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,833
he's gonna get a walk after being charged
in a multimillion-dollar drug seizure.

849
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:23,566
That doesn't happen very often

850
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,574
and, when it does happen,
the name and number

851
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:30,204
of the defense attorney goes in the front pocket
of every respectable drug trafficker.

852
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,373
You're a genius for what
you brought me on this.

853
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,042
I'm just doing what I do, right?

854
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,677
You need to know something,
all you gotta do is ask.

855
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,710
That's what a detective is, right?

856
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,656
Here. You should come over for dinner tonight.

857
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:44,853
- Yvette's making brisket.
- Your house?

858
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,786
You're mishpocha now.

859
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,068
If you say so.

860
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,708
It's down.

861
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:12,448
Not that this thing is ever going to trial.
That guy has N.C.R. Written all over him.

862
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:16,516
Can't argue. A padded room
at Clifton T. Perkins is definitely called for.

863
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:19,722
- He go for all of them?
- No, sir. Just the last two.

864
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:22,993
- He deny the others?
- He ain't exactly denying anything in there.

865
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,432
I mean, he'll cop to anything we damn please.

866
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:27,527
Then go back and get it.

867
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,538
Excuse me?

868
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:33,303
If he's N.C.R., what the fuck is the difference
if he cops to two or six?

869
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,937
Either way, they tie his arms
and feed him green Jell-o.

870
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,640
Sir, he did the last two.

871
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:40,882
Motherfucker.

872
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:45,249
You are a cunt hair away from indictment
and you see fit to argue with me?

873
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:50,222
I did what I did. I know.

874
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,694
And now I'm standing responsible
for two fresh murders.

875
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:54,720
I know what I've done here.

876
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:57,389
But I'm not doing this.

877
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:08,971
This is over

878
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:13,346
and all of our citizens can rest soundly
in the knowledge that the man responsible

879
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,910
has been apprehended by
the diligent efforts of investigators.

880
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:19,979
Mr. Mayor, is he being charged
with all of the murders

881
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:24,756
- or just two?
- It is my understanding that...

882
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:29,790
We are charging the last two incidents

883
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:33,233
but it is my understanding that he is suspected
in all of the crimes.

884
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,203
We're waiting for D.N.A. Test results.

885
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,173
Indications are that he may be
mentally incapacitated

886
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:42,735
and therefore additional prosecutions
would prove redundant.

887
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:45,714
I would also like to credit
Deputy Commissioner for Operations Daniels

888
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:49,206
with not only bringing these cases
to their proper conclusion

889
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:53,712
but also for solving last year's slayings
in the vacant rowhouses.

890
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,951
He has given us such excellent work

891
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,859
that I think that now is as good a time
as any to announce

892
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,591
that we will be sending
the deputy's name forward

893
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:05,795
to the city council for confirmation
as Baltimore Police Commissioner.

894
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:11,970
Acting commissioner Rawls,
to whom I am also extremely grateful,

895
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:16,001
will serve in an advisory capacity
pending new responsibilities at City Hall.

896
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:34,727
You should be working the main bar
on the arrest with Alma.

897
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:35,788
I...

898
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:38,357
We're going to want
your byline in this coverage.

899
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:41,833
Yeah, I don't feel so well. My stomach...

900
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,532
I think I gotta go home.

901
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,099
Sorry.

902
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:35,986
Having ducked the bullet
on that homeless mess,

903
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:40,724
I want you to know that the Mayor
and I both appreciate your discretion.

904
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:43,231
But right now we can't
take our eyes off the ball

905
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,962
when it comes to crime overall.

906
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:48,835
Looking at your weekly
U.C.R. S from the districts,

907
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:52,398
I am not seeing the kind of decline
that's going to measure out

908
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:54,410
to a ten per cent drop in the quarter.

909
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:57,004
- They're clean.
- Excuse me?

910
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,980
The stats are clean.

911
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,275
They're gonna stay clean.

912
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,810
Either we fix this Police Department
and the crime goes down

913
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:08,380
or we don't and the crime stays up.

914
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:12,087
Commissioner, we're talking about a little help

915
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:14,494
in the next couple quarters. That's all.

916
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,691
No. I can't.

917
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:21,164
You're quiet on the homeless fiasco
but this makes you squeal?

918
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:24,537
Tell the Mayor his stats will be clean

919
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:28,305
before the election, after the election.

920
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,612
You're right. They can't fire you.

921
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,211
Not without it bouncing back on City Hall.

922
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,816
If you don't mind being buried
in some backroom unit,

923
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:42,825
you can stay for as long as you can stand it.

924
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:46,218
Or until you get the pension.

925
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:50,988
But, at the same time,
I can't let you do police work.

926
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:54,002
Not anything that's going to find its way
into a courtroom.

927
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,936
I won't do that.

928
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:58,798
For both of you,

929
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:00,399
that's over.

930
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,350
So Marlo walks.

931
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:12,217
Or you go to jail.

932
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:14,815
And you couldn't do any better with Levy?

933
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:17,892
I mean, giving up the money...

934
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,457
I got what I could.

935
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,861
You lost the money trail, Lester,

936
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:30,304
when you decided to start colouring
outside the lines.

937
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:36,409
This isn't on me.

938
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:42,942
What the fuck you mean you selling?

939
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:45,283
- I'm sellin' the connect.
- How much, yo?

940
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:51,084
- Ten million.
- Goddamn.

941
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:54,790
Or a high bid if I hear ten
from more than one of y'all.

942
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:58,232
Y'all think it ain't worth that,
I stick that shit back in my pocket

943
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:01,703
and y'all can go back to runnin'
that stepped-on New York shit.

944
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:05,374
You don't mind me askin', why you sellin'?

945
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:10,974
I mean, even from inside here, you can
take a slice for just layin' in the cut, nigger.

946
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,640
Ain't gonna be in here long.

947
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,617
Case they got against me already fallin' apart.

948
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,886
But the truth is,

949
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:23,391
I'm done with this gangsta shit.

950
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:25,291
I've been there, done that.

951
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:28,161
You somethin' else other than a gangsta?

952
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,928
Businessman. Yeah, Tall Man,

953
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:34,835
I can't get that shit
wrapped around my head neither.

954
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:41,909
Anyway, y'all can't get my price up,
maybe y'all pool your money.

955
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:46,344
But supply only gonna deal with y'all

956
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,680
after I make the intro.

957
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,854
Then I'm out.

958
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:56,953
You've got a problem.
I thought Daniels was your boy.

959
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:59,553
We both got a problem if crime doesn't drop.

960
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:02,723
Carcetti loses the statehouse
and you aren't mayor.

961
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:04,960
And even if he wins, Nerese, you're stuck

962
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:07,868
with a Police Commissioner
that won't work with you.

963
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,462
I'm not stuck with anything.

964
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:11,905
Daniels either comes around or he's done.

965
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:15,570
We just anointed him.
We can't go back on that now. He knows it.

966
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:18,978
Either he learns his place
or he'll be offering to resign.

967
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:22,579
You ain't the only one
knows how to play this game.

968
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:34,628
What to say about this piece of work?

969
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:39,226
Fucked if I don't find myself
without the right words.

970
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:42,567
Me, as gifted a golden throat
as any of you cocksuckers

971
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,403
being loosed from religion,
are ever likely to hear.

972
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,773
What can I say about the dearly departed?

973
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,674
- I mean, really...
- He died young.

974
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:52,704
- Too young.
- Not even 40 years old.

975
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:55,546
Though, had it lived,
his dick woulda been 134.

976
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:58,779
Shut up. It's coming to me.

977
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:04,222
He was the black sheep,

978
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:07,161
the permanent pariah.

979
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:10,427
He asked no quarter of the bosses
and none was given.

980
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,400
He learned no lessons,

981
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:14,826
he acknowledged no mistakes.

982
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,804
He was as stubborn a Mick as ever stumbled

983
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,967
out of the Northeast parishes
to take a patrolman's shield.

984
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:21,704
He brooked no authority.

985
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:25,441
He did what he wanted to do
and he said what he wanted to say

986
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:29,008
and, in the end,
he gave you the clearances.

987
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:33,545
- He's natural police.
- Yes, he was.

988
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:36,888
I don't say that about many people,
even when they're here on the felt.

989
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:39,554
I don't give that one up
unless it happens to be true.

990
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:42,593
Natural poh-leece.

991
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,204
But Christ, what an asshole.

992
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:02,407
And I'm not talkin' about the ordinary,
gaping orifice that all of us possess.

993
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:06,410
I mean an all-encompassing,
all-consuming,

994
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:10,084
out of proportion to every other facet
of his humanity chasm.

995
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,285
From whose borne,
if I may quote Shakespeare,

996
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,126
no traveler has ever returned.

997
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,689
- The fuck did I do?
- Shut the fuck up.

998
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:19,724
You're dead to us now.

999
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,029
Here's his partner in crime.

1000
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:30,301
Now, now. Be gentle. Be gentle.

1001
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:32,337
I'm a civilian now. Be gentle.

1002
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,349
Your papers went in?

1003
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,944
- Yeah, this afternoon. 32 years.
- And four months.

1004
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,520
Y'all did a fine job with him, you did.

1005
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:45,823
He look to be about ten years younger
than I remember.

1006
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:49,592
Well, c'mon, there's enough room
for both of you to be laid out.

1007
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:54,293
One at a time.

1008
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:56,395
You don't crowd a man at his own wake.

1009
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:00,105
Come on, Lester. Come and snuggle.

1010
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:04,911
Keep our secrets, Jimmy.
I got Shardene with me tonight.

1011
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:09,281
If you gentlemen will spare us
this unfortunate homoerotic lapse,

1012
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,377
I will conclude my elegiac remarks.

1013
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,786
Then do it, you gabby motherfucker.

1014
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:17,224
To conclude. To conclude,

1015
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,387
I say he gave us 13 years on the line.

1016
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:24,729
Not enough for a pension
but enough for us to know that he was...

1017
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,496
Put the fucking song on.

1018
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:29,003
...despite his negligible Irish ancestry,

1019
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,063
his defects of personality,

1020
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,543
and his inconstant sobriety and hygiene,

1021
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,872
a true murder police.

1022
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:44,152
I say this seriously.

1023
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:47,645
If I was laying there dead
on some Baltimore street corner,

1024
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:50,557
I'd want it to be you standing over me,
catching the case.

1025
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:52,254
Bullshit.

1026
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:59,697
Because, brother, when you were good,
you were the best we had.

1027
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:06,599
Shit, if you was lying there dead on some
corner, it was probably Jimmy that done ya.

1028
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,575
Fuck you! If you caught the case,

1029
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:11,876
you'd be standing there pissing in my ear.

1030
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:36,093
How did Nerese Campbell get it?

1031
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:39,328
You think I asked?
Do you think it even matters?

1032
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:43,065
She gave it to me because
she thought you'd listen to me.

1033
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:45,130
So now they want me to go.

1034
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:48,571
The way she expressed it
is that she wanted you to stay

1035
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:50,442
if you could come to your senses.

1036
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:52,470
Come to my senses.

1037
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:58,119
She wants me to juke the stats for Carcetti,
this quarter and the next,

1038
01:10:58,153 --> 01:11:00,451
hide the crime,
get him elected as governor

1039
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:03,049
and make her the Mayor.

1040
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,492
So do it.
Burrell juked them before you.

1041
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:07,085
Warren Frasier before him.

1042
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:11,122
And, after you're gone,
Rawls or whoever will juke them. So what?

1043
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,657
I'll swallow a lie when I have to.

1044
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,795
I've swallowed a few big ones lately.

1045
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:21,642
But the stat games, that lie,
it's what ruined this department.

1046
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:23,804
Shining up shit and calling it gold,

1047
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,576
so majors become colonels
and mayors become governors.

1048
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:30,016
Pretending to do police work
while one generation fucking trains the next

1049
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:32,486
how not to do the job. And then...

1050
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:39,150
I looked Carcetti in the eye.

1051
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:42,695
I shook his hand.
I asked him if he was for real.

1052
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:46,124
This is the lie I can't live with.

1053
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:50,396
If I do, then Nerese has me in her pocket
whenever she wants me.

1054
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:53,408
And I'm no good to anyone like that.

1055
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:55,307
Then go.

1056
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:59,280
Withdraw for personal reasons
or health reasons.

1057
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,782
Whatever.

1058
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,808
You've got your law degree.
You're not gonna starve.

1059
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:08,684
But if you don't go,
they'll wreck both of us.

1060
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:10,919
There's not enough in here to indict me.

1061
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:12,756
And the joke of it is,

1062
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:16,287
I've seen enough the last few days
to have them indicted.

1063
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,197
For what?

1064
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:22,165
Then use it, Cedric, or at least threaten to.

1065
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:24,172
People will get hurt.

1066
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,002
People I care about.

1067
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:32,013
Then you're done.
There's enough in that file

1068
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:34,379
that you'll never make it
through confirmation hearings.

1069
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:38,250
And enough so that my career is dead
before it even gets started.

1070
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:44,992
The tree that doesn't bend breaks, Cedric.

1071
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:48,595
Bend too far, you're already broken.

1072
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:52,434
Marlo on a walk.

1073
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:56,633
And the money,
she gave that away, too.

1074
01:12:58,173 --> 01:13:00,141
Yeah.

1075
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:02,109
We don't get to follow the money.

1076
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,308
Hey, wonderin' where you was.

1077
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:10,648
I didn't know if I should come out on this here.

1078
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:12,745
Why the fuck not?

1079
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:14,483
Was me who told Daniels.

1080
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:20,450
I didn't want to do it behind your back but...

1081
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,293
it had to be done.

1082
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:33,300
Anyway, it was great being on the job with y'all.

1083
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:37,470
I just wanted to say that too, I guess.

1084
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:40,310
So what?

1085
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,442
You ain't gonna drink with me?

1086
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:46,412
I am if you want.

1087
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:49,881
Detective,

1088
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,753
if you think it needed doing...

1089
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:54,524
I guess it did.

1090
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:03,768
You coming?

1091
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:25,657
Milton came with 600.

1092
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,359
And Little Glen is in for three.

1093
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:30,228
I got five from me

1094
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:32,859
and I got five from Chinaman to cover.

1095
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:36,098
- We still short 900.
- I can go that. No thing.

1096
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,868
What? Motherfucker, where you get
that kind of scratch?

1097
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:40,602
You don't think Cheese know this here game?

1098
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:43,839
We sellin' dope an' coke in Baltimore, nigger,

1099
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:46,780
any of y'all ain't got that kind of money
need be ashamed.

1100
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:50,114
You still puttin' up more
than your share with that.

1101
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:53,885
The way I look at it,
we all gonna be more than paid

1102
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:55,583
once we own the connect, so...

1103
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:58,286
Shit, nigger, we was good
when your uncle had it.

1104
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:00,591
You had to go ahead and put up with Marlo.

1105
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,590
See that? See now,

1106
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:05,827
that's just the wrong way to look at it

1107
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:09,497
'cause Joe had his time
and Omar put an end to that.

1108
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:12,063
Then Marlo had his time,
short as it was,

1109
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:14,041
and the police put an end to that.

1110
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:16,738
And now, motherfucker, it's our time.

1111
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:19,246
Mines and yours.

1112
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:21,943
But instead of just shutting up and kicking in,

1113
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:24,817
you gonna stand there cryin'
that back-in-the-day shit.

1114
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,946
There ain't no back in the day, nigger.

1115
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:29,355
Ain't no nostalgia to this shit here.

1116
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:33,858
There's just the street and the game

1117
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:35,625
and what happen here today.

1118
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:37,461
You right.

1119
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:45,269
When it was my uncle,
I was with my uncle.

1120
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,935
When it was Marlo,
I was with him.

1121
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:49,841
But now, nigger...

1122
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:57,950
What the fuck did you do that for?

1123
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:00,386
Now we short the nine.

1124
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:02,117
That was for Joe.

1125
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:07,393
This sentimental motherfucker
just cost us money.

1126
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,457
Hey, Alma...

1127
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:58,438
I just heard.

1128
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:01,943
The Carroll County bureau?
That's how they punish me?

1129
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:04,639
Why not just send my ass
all the way to Pennsylvania?

1130
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,614
What'd they tell you?

1131
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:10,550
That I did an excellent job,
that this had nothing to do with anything

1132
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:13,577
but trying to make
the county bureaus stronger.

1133
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:19,291
Alma, I didn't tell them about the notepad.
I left that part out.

1134
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:23,229
I told them. When I heard you were in trouble,
I went to Whiting,

1135
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:27,099
told him I thought you were right about Scott.
I told him about the notepad.

1136
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:29,160
Did he make all of it up?

1137
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:33,504
- The calls from the killer? The pictures?
- Some, not all.

1138
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:37,004
- Why?
- Look around.

1139
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,238
The pond is shrinking.

1140
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:42,682
The fish are nervous.

1141
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,709
Get some profile, win a prize,

1142
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:47,449
maybe find a bigger pond somewhere.

1143
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,719
Whiting, Klebanow, Templeton...

1144
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:55,626
They snatch a Pulitzer or two
and they are up and gone from this place.

1145
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:58,123
For them, that's what this is all about.

1146
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,396
Me? I'm too fucking simpleminded for that.

1147
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:06,767
I just wanted to see
something new every day

1148
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:08,241
and write a story with it.

1149
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:14,909
Alma, you'll write your way
outta Carroll in no time, watch.

1150
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:18,852
About as fast as you edit your way
off the copy desk?

1151
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,095
Congratulations, Sergeant Goette.

1152
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:40,641
I know you'll do well in the Eastern.

1153
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,112
Glad I got to do this at least.
Congratulations, Lieutenant Carver.

1154
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:53,747
Thank you, sir. I'm just sorry
it won't be you I'm serving under.

1155
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,654
Word gets around?

1156
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,817
It's on W.B.A.L. Today.

1157
01:19:57,859 --> 01:20:00,726
They said you're leaving for family reasons.

1158
01:20:00,762 --> 01:20:04,129
I guess I got some kids
somewhere I don't even know about.

1159
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:06,031
They say on B.A.L. Who they're sending up

1160
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:08,399
- as acting commissioner?
- Say it ain't so.

1161
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:15,502
Ladies and gentlemen,

1162
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:20,174
as what may be my last official act
as a Baltimore police officer,

1163
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:23,082
allow me to congratulate
all of the promoted officers,

1164
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:26,849
their families, their fellow officers
and their friends.

1165
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:39,094
You ain't careful, they may make you major,
then you'll be truly fucked.

1166
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:40,431
- Good job.
- Thanks.

1167
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:41,867
- Proud of you.
- Thanks.

1168
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:02,946
See now, there you go, giving a fuck
when it ain't your turn to give a fuck.

1169
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:05,619
- Lehman's squad was up.
- I needed the O.T.

1170
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,322
Yeah, now you got a shooting with no wits,

1171
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:11,696
no suspect and no prayer
of it going to black.

1172
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:13,701
Picking up the phone
like a goddamn rookie. Shame on you.

1173
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:16,260
Stop squealin' like a bitch.

1174
01:21:16,304 --> 01:21:18,636
An' make sure you don't step
on that shell casing behind you.

1175
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:21,301
I ain't gonna kick no shell casings behind me.
It's there on the side.

1176
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:25,803
I'm gonna step back and kick no shell casing
you don't mark with letters and numbers.

1177
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:32,376
I understand.
And you gotta be in the system.

1178
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:35,446
- They sent you the form.
- They told me that wasn't good enough.

1179
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,481
They said they wanted the other paperwork.

1180
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:40,619
- And you applied for S.S. I., Mr. Belton?
- Yes, ma'am.

1181
01:21:40,662 --> 01:21:43,426
Well, let's go inside
and look it up on the computer.

1182
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:44,864
Hey, you remember me?

1183
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:51,035
I brought this guy in a few weeks back,
just wanted to see how he was.

1184
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:53,905
He wandered out after a couple nights.

1185
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:55,534
Sorry.

1186
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:58,702
Where...

1187
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:02,808
- Where do the homeless go around here?
- Different places. Down by the river,

1188
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:04,842
over in the warehouse district.

1189
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:09,054
Some of the places I don't think
it would be safe for you to go.

1190
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,786
I'm police. Well, I used to be.

1191
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:13,987
Wait here. I'll see if I can find you a map.

1192
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:16,293
- Thanks.
- Come on, Mr. Belton.

1193
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,966
...and if the major could find his ass
with his hand,

1194
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:24,972
he'd know that we have more than enough
to be up on a pen register.

1195
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:26,667
Lieutenant Carver told him so.

1196
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:29,836
But fuck if he isn't trying
to shut this thing down.

1197
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:37,107
Alls I'm sayin' is a phone call or two
and you're gonna find out

1198
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:40,212
that they're getting some kinda pressure
from somewhere to sit on this thing,

1199
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:43,053
even though we've tied three killings
to this crew.

1200
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:46,690
Does the Police Commissioner know?

1201
01:22:46,728 --> 01:22:51,188
Him? He wouldn't know police work
if it took down his front door on a warrant.

1202
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:59,201
Just... keep my name out of it.

1203
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:04,937
New Westport is like Howard Street
ten years ago,

1204
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,675
except the land's cheaper

1205
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:09,707
and there's more potential for mixed use
because of the waterfront location.

1206
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:13,187
- There you are.
- You can't put a price on a water view.

1207
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:15,246
Yes, you can.

1208
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:17,155
You definitely can.

1209
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:20,059
Andy, he's gotta meet Tommy
and they're leaving early

1210
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:21,585
so let me borrow him for a moment.

1211
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:24,655
Sure, no problem.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stanfield.

1212
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:29,393
You know who you were talking to?

1213
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:32,136
Andy Krawczyk.

1214
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:35,574
Very connected. Very big with development
around the harbour.

1215
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:37,942
He's someone you're gonna wanna know well.

1216
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,741
But kid, do not...

1217
01:23:42,917 --> 01:23:45,147
Do not get in a room with him alone.

1218
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:48,587
You want me in there with you, believe me,
otherwise guys like that will bleed you.

1219
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:50,853
I want you to meet Tommy Flanagan
before he leaves.

1220
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:53,793
Yeah, gimme a minute. I need to...

1221
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:55,318
- Bathroom?
- Yeah.

1222
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:57,297
Down the hall to the right.

1223
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:04,528
Hey, watch that stuff. You'll put on weight.

1224
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,685
But next time, I want you to make sure

1225
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,557
that you watch this money...

1226
01:24:29,297 --> 01:24:30,958
Don't. Don't do it.

1227
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,531
Time to give that up.

1228
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,634
Do you know who I am?

1229
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:45,237
Name's Vinson. Used to be Marlo's bank,

1230
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:50,149
but Marlo ain't around no more
and you still moving money for other players,

1231
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:54,315
so I'm thinking some of that money
need to be mine.

1232
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:57,518
Shit. You just a boy.

1233
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,291
That's just your knee.

1234
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:05,196
That motherfucker shot me.

1235
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:13,798
Nice doing business, gentlemen.

1236
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:21,512
No way, that's bullshit.

1237
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:23,983
I heard it different.
The real story about Omar

1238
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:26,748
is that a bunch of cops made it look
like them New York boys killed him.

1239
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:29,518
But it was them.
They're the ones that really killed him.

1240
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:32,151
Listen, motherfucker,
I know what happened to him.

1241
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:36,027
Them police had nothing to do with it.
No New York boys neither.

1242
01:25:36,064 --> 01:25:39,158
So Omar's got an A.K., right?
But he's surrounded.

1243
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,966
It's like eight, nine motherfuckers up there
and they all got nines.

1244
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:46,462
- But he like, "You all think you..."
- Fuck you lookin' at?

1245
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:49,906
- You, nigger.
- Do you know who I am?

1246
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:51,536
Nigger, you know who I am?

1247
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:55,710
Shit!

1248
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:22,100
Yeah.

1249
01:27:51,532 --> 01:27:54,126
...on me, all right?

1250
01:28:20,395 --> 01:28:22,158
Thank you. Thank you.

1251
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:26,567
Thank you.

1252
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,296
This is a great day for Democrats

1253
01:28:28,336 --> 01:28:30,770
and it's a great day for Maryland.

1254
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:35,933
I hope I get this by e-dot.

1255
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:40,209
OK, three minutes, for Christ's sake.
Don't get your panties in a knot.

1256
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:57,757
Commissioner Valchek.

1257
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:18,545
Madam Prosecutor, gentlemen...

1258
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:23,518
The first case up and I have to recuse myself.

1259
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:25,958
Your Honour, I appreciate your concern.

1260
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:46,205
Congratulations, Superintendent.

1261
01:29:46,247 --> 01:29:48,442
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, Governor.

1262
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:50,508
- Happy to be aboard.
- Thank you.

1263
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,270
Larry.

1264
01:31:34,121 --> 01:31:36,112
Let's go home.

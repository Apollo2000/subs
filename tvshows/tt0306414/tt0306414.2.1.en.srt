2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,500
Freezing my balls off.

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,400
It ain't so bad. Loosen up.
Couple more months, it's gonna be spring.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,800
Spring, huh?

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,800
Listen, you gotta realize the bosses
did you a favor sending you down here.

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,400
-Citywide to Marine Unit.
-7672. Go ahead.

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,800
Distress call from a private craft.
60-foot white vessel. Engines are dead.

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,300
What's the location, Citywide?

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,100
In the channel near the bridge.
About 2,000 yards off the Armistead pier.

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,200
10-4, we're responding.

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,600
My father used to work there.

12
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,800
-Beth Steel?
-In the shipyards there, yeah.

13
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,300
I had an uncle who was a supervisor there.
Got laid off in '78, though.

14
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,300
'73 for my dad.

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,800
-Party boat?
-Pretty one, yeah.

16
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,000
-More than one engine, right?
-Probably an electrical problem.

17
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,500
Is that a police boat?

18
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,700
How are you tonight? Good to see you.

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,300
Henry, how are you?

20
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,600
-Drink?
-No, thanks.

21
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,300
-You're the Captain?
-Yeah.

22
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,300
-Harbormaster?
-No, City Police.

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,600
-So you're dead in the water?
-Think it's the starter.

24
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,700
-You're not a mechanic, are you?
-Me? No.

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,900
I can't tell the aft from the stern.

26
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,500
Best I can offer you is a tow line.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,300
Claude, looks like they're gonna need a pull.

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,200
-10-4, we'll tow to Henderson's.
-That'll work.

29
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,000
Any chance you can hold off
on bringing us in?

30
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,400
Lot of partying going on now.

31
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,200
I wouldn't wanna cut it short
for a little engine trouble.

32
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,600
You're in the shipping channel.

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,300
You tow us somewhere out of the way,
and the band plays on a while longer.

34
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,500
...because you see what I'm saying, right?

35
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,000
I mean, three years in auto theft
and I didn't learn anything.

36
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,200
I didn't care.

37
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,200
I'm telling you,
I didn't even wanna be a police anymore.

38
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,600
I honestly didn't.

39
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,900
I think that was why
I shot up my car like I did.

40
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,200
But this thing we did on Barksdale,
the wiretap and all...

41
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,200
that felt like something.
That felt like something I wanna do.

42
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,100
So I was thinking, you know,
narcotics, maybe.

43
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,600
Major, you want this stuff where?

44
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,600
Just in here. 
Up against the wall over there.

45
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,300
If there aren't any openings
in the regular narcotics shift...

46
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,900
maybe assets forfeiture
or something like that.

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,300
Easy. Everything breaks.

48
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,700
I mean, with this Barksdale thing...

49
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,700
Lester Freamon had us deep into the money.
Real deep.

50
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,800
We could've seized real estate, cash,
vehicles, all kinds of stuff.

51
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,800
If the bosses, I mean,
if command had let that case go forward.

52
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,300
We were on it.

53
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,800
-Look at that. It's the dove.
-Right.

54
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,800
-So what do you think?
-What do I think?

55
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,300
I think you're gonna take
the Sergeant's Exam next month.

56
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,500
And because I have Andy Krawczyk's ear...

57
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,200
and because he has City Hall's ear...

58
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
you're gonna make Sergeant.

59
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,700
Then you're gonna come out here
to the Southeast...

60
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,100
where, because I'm your father-in-law...

61
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,800
you're gonna be assigned a daytime shift
in a quiet sector.

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,500
Then you're gonna take the Lieutenant's
Exam where you'll also score high.

63
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
I don't want to make rank.

64
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,500
I want to work cases. Good cases.

65
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,700
Roland.

66
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,000
Listen to me.

67
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,800
You did good with the drug thing.
You buckled down, you did the work.

68
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,500
And except for that thing
with the Grand Jury...

69
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,500
you helped take
some of the stink off yourself.

70
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,700
Now if you'll just shut up and listen to me...

71
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,800
you might actually have a career
in this department.

72
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,900
-This radio ain't working that well.
-We're losing it.

73
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,200
-We're losing the station, man.
-What you mean?

74
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,200
We done gone so far from Baltimore,
we're losing the station.

75
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,500
-Try a Philly station or some shit like that.
-The radio in Philly is different?

76
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,700
Nigger, you gotta be fucking with me, right?

77
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,900
You never heard a station
outside of Baltimore?

78
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,900
I ain't never left Baltimore
except that Boys' Village shit one day.

79
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And I wasn't trying to hear no radio
up in that bitch.

80
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,700
Come on, man. You're killing me. Stop.

81
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,500
It's been perfect tomato weather out there.

82
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,600
These wonderful hot, humid days,
and then rain at night.

83
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,600
-This a Philly station?
-How the fuck would I know?

84
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,200
Why would anybody wanna leave Baltimore?
That's what I'm asking.

85
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,200
Yo, that be the exit. Take that shit.

86
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,100
So far they on it.

87
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,900
Ahoy, matey.

88
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,200
The girls always tell me
about the little man in the boat.

89
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,100
-Now I know who they talking about.
-Come on board, man.

90
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,400
-Come on, I wanna show you.
-Fuck, no.

91
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,600
-What's the matter?
-The Bunk can't swim.

92
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,000
I ain't too good at floating, either.

93
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,600
So what brings you to the water's edge?

94
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,500
Ilene Nathan called.
Gant case is coming up in four weeks.

95
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,700
She wants to start doing preliminaries
on our witnesses.

96
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,300
That means the old lady from the projects,
which is no problem.

97
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,900
And your man Omar, who's in the wind.

98
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,600
You got a line on Omar, Jimmy?

99
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,900
-Well, he's not to starboard.
-That's port, fool.

100
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,200
-How the fuck would you know?
-Come on.

101
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,500
Let me buy you lunch
and we can think on this shit together.

102
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,400
I leave, I gotta tell my Sergeant.

103
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,500
That reminds me. Landsman wants his $10.

104
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,000
-What for?
-For betting that you'd ride the boat.

105
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,500
You tell that motherfucker
he's not gonna see that money...

106
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,400
especially since it was probably him
told Rawls where I didn't wanna go.

107
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,100
-Ain't the same up there without your ass.
-No?

108
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,600
Better, actually.

109
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,100
Hey, come on, now.

110
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,100
The canal gets dredged...

111
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,100
it means we all work.
Your people, my people.

112
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,000
The canal's the key, Nat. You know this.

113
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,600
Yeah, but you know how much money
you're gonna spend...

114
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,400
to even get them talking about that shit?

115
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,700
We don't take a shot,
we might as well roll over and die right now.

116
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,900
No, you get them to rebuild the grain pier.

117
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,800
-You got a 100 ships right there.
-That's break-bulk, Nat.

118
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,000
Best you'll do is one or two
extra gangs a week on them blowers.

119
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,900
That's six or seven-man gangs at best.

120
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,800
But you try for that, you might actually
come away with something.

121
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,700
You go down to Annapolis
asking for the goddamn canal...

122
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,700
you gonna come back with nothing but
your little shriveled-ass dick in your hand.

123
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,600
What's more,
if the grain pier don't get fixed up soon...

124
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,300
some asshole's gonna fuck us
by building condominiums all over it.

125
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,900
-Nat, if the canal were 2 feet deeper--
-Fuck the canal.

126
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
I'm going to the District Council.

127
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm gonna tell them
to push for the grain pier.

128
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,500
-You feel me?
-Nat, calm the fuck down.

129
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,200
Goddamn Checkers Local always acting
like you're the king of everything and shit.

130
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
Nat, listen to me. If we--

131
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,000
Y'all need to crawl back down
in them holds...

132
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,300
and remind yourself of who you is
and where you come from.

133
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,700
Damn, Frank.

134
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,200
We just sat here and watched Nat Coxson
take a shit all over you.

135
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,800
And shrivel-dick motherfucker
that you are, you take it.

136
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,900
For your information...

137
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,300
I wake up every morning
with an angry, blue-veined diamond-cutter.

138
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,900
I was gonna enlighten the president
of Local 47 on this particular point...

139
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,900
and he chose to depart.

140
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,200
-Blue steel, gentlemen.
-For Christ's sake.

141
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,200
Three-and-a-half inches of hard blue steel.

142
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,500
-Nicky boy, you working today?
-As a lasher for Big Roy's crew.

143
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,100
Attaboy. Make the family proud.

144
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,400
First day they give me in two weeks.

145
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,900
-Is Ott around?
-On his ass as usual.

146
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,200
Worthless fuck still owes me $20
for them lotto tickets.

147
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,400
Hey, Nick.

148
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,300
You need to see the Greek
and get a number. He's got one on the way.

149
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,000
-Today?
-Tomorrow.

150
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,500
The Atlantic Light over at North Point.

151
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,800
All right.

152
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,000
-Yo, Frank.
-What's up?

153
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,800
You gotta get with Ziggy, man.
He's all over the place.

154
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm here since 8:00.
You know I been here since 8:00.

155
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,800
-Hold your horses.
-You fucking goose.

156
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm gonna find it for you.
Just shut the fuck up a minute.

157
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,700
How we doing?

158
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,000
-Ain't a problem, Chief.
-The fuck it ain't.

159
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,400
I'm down here since 8:00
for crane-to-chassis...

160
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,600
-and Tweety Bird here lost the can.
-It ain't lost.

161
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,400
It's right here on the manifest as a hot box.
Where is it, Zig?

162
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,900
-It's either in Bay 7, or--
-Bay 7 is empty, man.

163
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,600
Or it ain't. In that case...

164
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,400
it's definitely somewhere in the stacks.

165
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,600
Jesus fucking Christ.

166
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,300
You're killing me here, Ziggy.
You are fucking killing me.

167
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,900
Get me a number for your shipping agent.
I'll call and try to square it.

168
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,200
And you.

169
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,900
You clock out today and leave your box,
and don't ever come the fuck back.

170
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,000
You hear me, Zig? You're fired.

171
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,000
Later for you, goofus.

172
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,100
Fucking guy.
He loses his job and he couldn't care less.

173
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,200
-He ain't fired, man.
-No?

174
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,900
That's his father.

175
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,600
How fast you need this?

176
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,400
Case goes to trial in a month.
Got to start prepping it this week.

177
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,800
Officer Burns.

178
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,900
Detective.

179
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,500
I heard they posted you down here.

180
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,700
But, I mean, you know, damn.

181
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,400
These motherfuckers don't play, do they?

182
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,900
So what brings you downstairs?

183
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,300
I was pulling evidence on the Gant case.

184
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,400
You know, trial date for Bird is next month
and llene Nathan wanted to be ready.

185
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,200
You give him my love.

186
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,100
-Who?
-Bird.

187
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,800
-No evidence.
-What do you mean, no evidence?

188
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,100
Submission slip says
"Row BB, Section 14, Shelf 3...

189
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,000
"Four, Right rear." It says that.

190
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,800
-So?
-No such thing.

191
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,500
BB has 1 2 sections. This says 14.
You see what I'm saying?

192
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,900
No evidence.

193
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,300
Winters kill off
the weaker varieties of caterpillars.

194
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,300
-Fuck me.
-...that's of an entirely different breed....

195
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Fuck.

196
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
...protection against caterpillars,
they eat right through it.

197
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,600
But it is a sort of a warning system.

198
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,600
They here.

199
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,800
Franoosh, you made it.

200
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,400
Right, Father. Got you covered here.

201
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,700
Come on.

202
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
You wanna see your window?

203
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,100
Only Franoosh Sobotka would send
all the way to Esslingen for stained glass.

204
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,700
The Germans are hard-headed,
but you can't beat them for craft.

205
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,300
I was glad to do it, Father,
for the church, you know.

206
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,100
Truth is I need to ask you
something in return.

207
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,800
Anything I can do.

208
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,200
-I need some face time with the Senator.
-Barbara?

209
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
She comes to the early mass on Sunday,
the one in Polish.

210
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,000
We got nothing but problems, Father.

211
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,400
We need to see something happen
with the C&D Canal...

212
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,500
and the grain pier's been down for a year.

213
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,400
I got tough guys coming in
to confess things I never heard before.

214
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,300
I don't need you to tell me
how bad things are at the docks.

215
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,200
So you'll set something up
with Mikulski soon?

216
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,100
You didn't need a German window
to ask me for that, Francis.

217
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,000
And what's more...

218
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,500
you've made offerings
way above what it would take...

219
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,700
to get that window up there.

220
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,600
How long since your last confession?

221
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,300
I'll see you, Father.

222
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,400
This shit might be somewhere else, man.

223
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,500
Yo, the shit is always up in the door, man.

224
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,700
Motherfucker, you been
standing there watching us.

225
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,000
You see any shit come up out of there?

226
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,000
You seen we ain't take shit up off this car.

227
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,200
-All right.
-You seen it.

228
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,100
Who gonna believe us? This shit is missing.

229
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,700
And fuck what you're saying.

230
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,300
All he's gonna hear
is that this shit is fucking missing.

231
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,500
Yo, check it again.

232
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,400
Yo, the shit ain't there, man.
Call your man and say so.

233
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,100
Nigger, what you say?

234
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,700
-I said check it again, God damn it!
-Whoa, chill.

235
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,300
Yo, man, cut that shit the fuck out.

236
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,300
What the fuck is going on today, man?

237
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,900
Taking their time, ain't they?

238
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,400
What the hell is going on?

239
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,400
Come on, man.

240
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,600
Damn!

241
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,500
-Ain't anywhere in this section either.
-Start on the next row.

242
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,100
Lieutenant, those two bags could be
anywhere in this damn basement.

243
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,600
You're right.

244
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,400
-We could be here all night.
-Right again.

245
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,500
So that's overtime, right?

246
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,200
Fuck me. I still cannot type.

247
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,400
Fucking white boys, I love them.
I fucking love them.

248
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,200
-Yeah?
-Dumb as a box of rocks.

249
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,600
-Who?
-White boys.

250
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,400
Talking about the brain-deads
in my Kane Street case.

251
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,900
I call him up,
I tell him I wanna buy some drugs.

252
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,300
You know what he says?

253
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,100
"Okay, I'll sell you the drugs.
How much drugs do you want?"

254
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,000
I swear to God, Kima, they don't code it,
they don't ask for a meet, nothing.

255
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,200
And then when you make the deal,
there's no runner, no bullshit.

256
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,500
It's the guy himself
walking up to you, saying:

257
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,900
"I brought the drugs.
Did you bring the money?"

258
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,700
I'm not kidding.
I have much respect for black people...

259
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
after working with these idiots
for two weeks.

260
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,000
If white boys wanna sell drugs in Baltimore,
they have to make different laws for it...

261
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,600
Iike even it out for them.

262
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,800
-Affirmative action.
-Leave no white man behind.

263
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,000
-What the fuck do you want?
-I need you to do the seizures.

264
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,400
You got titles, deeds, registrations?
What do you have for me?

265
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,100
Thought you did that.
You're the Forfeiture Unit, right?

266
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,200
I write all the affidavits
and the filing for the City Solicitor.

267
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,100
But you've gotta give me the information
on what we're taking.

268
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,200
That's a fucking hassle.

269
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,000
You want the property, do the paperwork.

270
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,000
You gotta step up, Herc.
You don't have me or Carver to lean on here.

271
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,100
No?

272
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,200
How about you come
on the raids tomorrow?

273
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Take a few doors with me
for old time's sake.

274
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
You taking doors?

275
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,100
Yeah, two houses and a bar on Kane Street.

276
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,500
Come on, Kima, mount up with us.
I know you miss it.

277
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,100
I'm done rolling around the gutter.
I am inside now.

278
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,800
-You're a housecat now?
-I made a promise.

279
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,100
I gotta say, Kima. If you were a guy...

280
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,300
and, actually, in some ways
you're better than most guys I know.

281
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,700
If you were a guy, your friends
would buy you a beer and let you know.

282
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,800
-Let me know what?
-You're fucking whipped.

283
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,900
-Whipped?
-Pussy-whipped within an inch of your life.

284
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,500
I kid you not.

285
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,500
So....

286
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,900
So?

287
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
So where do we find Omar?

288
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Who?

289
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,400
-He say anything else?
-No.

290
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,400
Just to come back. All of us.

291
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,000
How he say it?

292
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,300
You know, he just said it.

293
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,000
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

294
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,100
Shit.

295
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,400
-They holding to it?
-So far.

296
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,100
All right.

297
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,000
They got the times right?

298
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,400
How about the mileage?

299
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,400
All right.

300
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,200
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.

301
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,900
-You never saw him out the car?
-No.

302
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,900
-You stayed with him the whole time?
-Every minute.

303
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,800
How long before he came out
the parking garage?

304
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,600
-How long was he on his own?
-Not enough time to do shit, String.

305
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
He was in and out, like, in three minutes.

306
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,000
Chill.

307
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
-This shit is fucked up.
-Look--

308
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,600
You follow the directions?

309
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,100
-I did just like you told me.
-Wrote down the mileage?

310
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,800
-Yeah.
-Let me see.

311
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,400
See, right there.

312
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,400
No, you're three-tenths of a mile long, dawg.

313
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,300
And if you followed directions,
you wouldn't be.

314
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,900
String, I did everything like I should, man.
I swear.

315
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,400
You got answers?

316
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,000
You didn't have to take a detour
in Camden...

317
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,200
when they shut down a couple of blocks
on the Boulevard?

318
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,900
You hurt your foot?

319
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,600
-My foot?
-You know, the way you kicked that tire jack.

320
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,800
-You was on us the whole time?
-Who, me?

321
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,100
Y'all had people following us.

322
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,300
So where it at?

323
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,200
You know, you should take me with you.

324
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,800
I should meet these guys.
If I meet these guys...

325
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,800
we can figure out ways to do business.
You know what I'm saying?

326
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,300
-Zig, these guys are real.
-What, I ain't real?

327
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,400
Six degrees.

328
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,900
Everybody's going home
to sauerkraut and Santy Claus...

329
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,300
and here comes a gang of us
walking the other way...

330
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,800
Little Big Roy with his wooden leg.

331
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,300
-Christ, them wooden shovels.
-Yeah.

332
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,500
You children don't know nothing
about them wooden shovels, do you?

333
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,800
Can't have no sparks
when you working grain.

334
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,300
-Kaboom.
-It's more like kaput.

335
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,100
You never gonna see another grain ship
here in Bawlmer, my friends.

336
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,400
Zig, you believe these fucking dinosaurs?

337
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,800
They sit around all day talking shit about
how they used to off-load with shovels...

338
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,200
and carry fucking railroad cars
on their backs.

339
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,600
Shit, and drink whiskey through a fire hose.

340
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,300
Go home and fuck their wives till breakfast.
There was some heroes back then.

341
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,500
Shit is thick in here tonight, gentlemen.

342
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,200
What can you do?
This generation, they just don't know.

343
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,900
-Ain't never gonna be what it was.
-No, indeed.

344
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,700
Every night with these old fucks.
It's like 1952 and shit.

345
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,100
Boys, you know, when I was your age,
I unloaded ten ships a goddamn day.

346
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,500
You know, I'd do it with one arm...

347
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,800
after a 300-pound bag of Polish dildos
fell on me.

348
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,700
Whoa, wait. What the fuck is a Polish dildo?

349
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,100
Whoa, wait. What the fuck is a Polish dildo?

350
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,500
Actually, at my house, it's a ring of kielbasa.

351
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,800
Christ, here we go again.

352
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,400
Bring out pretty boy.

353
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,800
But, you know, where you boys hail from,
I'm sure any old breakfast link will do.

354
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,300
You know he's gonna
pull out his dick, right?

355
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,000
That boy ain't right.

356
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,400
It was just me...

357
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,500
and my old wooden leg,
and my old wooden shovel...

358
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,500
and my glass eye, and my Polish pencil.

359
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,800
Like anyone from the Checkers Local
ever used anything but a real pencil.

360
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,600
Shit, they don't even push
one of them no more.

361
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,700
Talking trash about 1514.

362
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,600
Jesus H. Christ, you know what?
All hands starboard.

363
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,600
Come on.

364
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,600
The old tub is listing. Can you feel her?

365
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,100
You wanna know why?

366
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,400
'Cause them old fucks
done unloaded so much bullshit...

367
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,000
that this whole motherfucker's
gonna capsize.

368
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Brace yourselves, we're sinking.

369
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,300
God damn it, Ziggy.

370
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,800
You're not taking your dick out
in here again.

371
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,200
Let me show you old gents some bulk cargo
that none of you could ever handle.

372
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,300
Who says they don't make them
like they used to?

373
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,700
Pretty boy is on the town tonight.

374
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,100
Fucking Ziggy, man.

375
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,800
-Bring her in the boat?
-Hell, no.

376
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,900
-She'll fall apart if we try to bring her in.
-What's the plan then?

377
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,500
We'll hook her real good.
We'll tow her slowly over to the pier.

378
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,000
-What's she look like?
-What do you mean?

379
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,200
-How long you think she's been in?
-She's fresh.

380
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,700
-Legs are broke, though.
-Probably a jumper from the bridge.

381
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,600
All right, Ma. Shit.

382
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,900
Kitchen's closed.

383
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,800
There's no service for drunks
who can't get up in time to catch a ship.

384
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,000
What ship?

385
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,700
Your father says the Talco Line is in today.

386
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,400
That makes two ships at North Point.

387
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,100
It's the Atlantic Light.
Ain't due until this afternoon.

388
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
That still is no excuse.

389
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,100
Good morning, Mom.

390
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,900
Couple of goddamn drunks I got.

391
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,100
And don't leave
without taking your cousin with you.

392
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,200
I gotta clean in there,
and I ain't gonna do it around his carcass.

393
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,500
You keep us guessing, don't you, Stan?

394
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,800
At Sunday mass, you can't be found.

395
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,600
But early on a Tuesday,
you arrive with an army.

396
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,500
$2,500 from myself and every other Polack...

397
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,300
in three districts and four firehouses.

398
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,700
-And to what do we owe such generosity?
-A surprise.

399
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,800
We ordered up a window
for where you renovated the nave.

400
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,000
A memorial. Let me see that.

401
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,000
To Polish police and firefighters.

402
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,900
Found this craftsman down in Glen Burnie
that you would not believe.

403
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,100
-For the nave?
-Yeah, for the nave.

404
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,800
We could use another window
on the second floor of the rectory.

405
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,500
-The rectory?
-The upstairs hallway.

406
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,200
How much did them dock boys offer
for this spot?

407
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,300
-I can match it.
-Offerings are confidential, Stan.

408
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,100
-And as you can see--
-I can go as high as $4,000.

409
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,400
Just tell me if they went higher than $4,000.

410
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,500
More than $4,000? From the docks?

411
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,300
How the hell....

412
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,200
I'm sorry, Father.

413
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,500
-Who came to you with the offer?
-Francis Sobotka.

414
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,200
Frank Sobotka has that kind of money?

415
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,900
-It was from his local.
-The Checkers?

416
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,500
-They don't have 100 guys left paying dues.
-It's a parish of givers, Stan.

417
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,600
Maybe you talk to Frank.

418
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,200
Work it out somehow.

419
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Yeah, we'll talk.

420
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,600
Major?

421
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,200
Well, if it isn't Barnacle Bill, the sailor.

422
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,500
Ray, how you been?

423
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,800
I got nothing but red ink
under my name this year.

424
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,600
Landsman's become an asshole with teeth.

425
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,200
-Fish your wish, huh?
-Jumper, probably.

426
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,300
-This close to the bridge.
-Probably, yeah.

427
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,400
-Pretty, though.
-She is, yeah.

428
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,100
I go into the men's room this morning.

429
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,700
Guess who's in the next stall
puking his guts out.

430
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,200
Bunk Moreland.

431
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,700
-How'd you know?
-Useless fuck can't hold his liquor.

432
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,200
-What's happening, man?
-What's up, Fam?

433
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,300
All right.

434
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,300
-You ain't heard from Roberto yet?
-Not a goddamn word, man.

435
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,300
Billy still got our money though, right?
So you need to get down to New York, man.

436
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Fuck kind of game this nigger playing?
You sure of our people?

437
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,600
I broke down all their stories
and they came back clean.

438
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,700
Besides, I had some good people
watching them.

439
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,600
-Who?
-Tank, Country.

440
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,800
-How long that motherfucker been home?
-A month.

441
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,700
Still on parole. He said, "fuck that."
Straight back in the mix.

442
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,900
All right.

443
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,200
So good, it ain't on us. It's on Roberto.
Set it straight. You know what I mean?

444
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,200
So when you go hard on them,
take it light, but be firm.

445
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,000
They got our money
and we ain't got the product.

446
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,700
So, you feel me? The shit ain't right.

447
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,900
How you fixed in here otherwise, B?

448
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,700
This ain't no thing, man.
You know what I mean?

449
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,800
You come in here, man,
you get your mind right.

450
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,000
You get in here and you do two days.
It's the day you come in this motherfucker--

451
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,500
-And the day you get out this motherfucker.
-That's right.

452
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,000
Exactly.

453
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,200
-What's up?
-How you doing?

454
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,500
-Coming from the hiring hall?
-I'm working the Atlantic late today.

455
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,300
-How's it looking for Local 47?
-You're shit out of luck.

456
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,600
ROIROs isn't going to anybody
lower than a G-series.

457
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,100
Best you can get,
maybe half a day doing break-bulk...

458
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,000
on an aluminum load at Locust Point.

459
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,700
-Half a day, huh?
-Seniority sucks.

460
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,400
-Yeah, if you ain't senior, it does.
-Yeah, you got that right.

461
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,600
-I'm out of here.
-Yeah, I'll see you.

462
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,900
-The fuck you ain't wake me up for?
-Just getting up now, fuck-face?

463
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,300
No, actually,
your ma makes a good breakfast.

464
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,900
-No fucking way.
-Bacon and eggs, baby.

465
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,400
You going down to see the Greek, right?

466
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,100
Come on, man.
I ain't gonna fuck it up for you.

467
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,800
For Christ's sake,
will you just get in the car already?

468
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,500
Come on. Let's go.

469
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,200
I swear to God, Ziggy.
You open your mouth, I'll fucking kill you.

470
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,700
-Nicky, from the docks.
-Spiros.

471
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
How are you? Good?

472
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,000
-Who's your friend?
-This is Zig, my uncle's kid.

473
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,300
-Your uncle? Frankie?
-Yeah.

474
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,000
Ziggy's his oldest.
My car broke down, you know. He drove.

475
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,800
So you must be the Greek.

476
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,300
Well, I'm Greek anyway.

477
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,100
Boris Badanoff.
I know you from around the way, right?

478
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,900
Why am I Boris? I don't understand this.
Everywhere I am Boris.

479
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,200
-Shit, you're Russian, right?
-No, Ukraine. Kyiv is Ukraine.

480
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,500
-It's the same difference, though.
-No, you're wrong.

481
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,600
What's the matter?
You don't like being called Boris?

482
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,700
Sergei.

483
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,200
No way, man. Boris is way better.
It's like the guy from the cartoon.

484
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,700
Boris and Natasha?

485
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,800
Bullwinkle, man. Rocky and Bullwinkle.

486
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,200
-You want some coffee, pie?
-No, I'm good.

487
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,000
-Actually, what kind of pie you got?
-Hey, Zig.

488
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,200
Shut the fuck up, huh?

489
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,800
Malaka.

490
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,300
No, it's cool. He's cool.

491
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,400
-That's Frank's kid?
-Yeah.

492
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,200
He's in the Union, you know.

493
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,800
But he's like an L-series,
so he ain't getting any hours.

494
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,000
-Same deal, same rate.
-All right. Who's driving?

495
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,200
Again?

496
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,500
You want to mix it up a little more.

497
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,500
Make it so customs doesn't put
no names to faces.

498
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,500
You trust a man, you stay with him.

499
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,200
-Okay.
-All right.

500
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,000
Boris it is.

501
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,000
-Sergei.
-Yeah, whatever.

502
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,200
Come on, fucknuts. Let's go.

503
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,100
-How's the open-face turkey?
-It's shit. Let's go.

504
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,300
See you guys later.

505
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,800
-Bullwinkle?
-Polacks.

506
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,500
You fucking embarrassed me in there, man.

507
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,600
You embarrassed yourself, Zig.

508
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,500
You seen my nephew anywhere?

509
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,600
Nick? Not yet.
I don't think he got any hours.

510
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,200
-Hey, Frank.
-Hey, darling.

511
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,000
Just so I can finish my paperwork early,
what are your people gonna steal today?

512
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,400
I don't know.

513
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,300
Couple luxury sedans,
some color TVs, wide-screen.

514
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,100
Maybe a couple cans of vodka,
maybe a whole container ship.

515
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,700
Okay. Y'all have a good one.

516
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,900
You let her fuck with you like that?

517
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,500
She's all right. I like her.

518
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,500
I checked the computer.
It's Bay 9, Cell 1 1 . It's right on the bottom.

519
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,500
-You working the light, ain't you?
-I'm on it, yeah.

520
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,600
-Did they say anything else?
-No. Just that it's the same money to us.

521
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,000
Let's go.

522
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,600
All right, Uncle Frank.

523
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,100
-Winona.
-Jimmy, where you been?

524
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
Look who it is. Sailor Boy.

525
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,500
-You owe me $10.
-Fuck you.

526
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,200
You told Rawls where I didn't wanna go.
You made it happen, Jay.

527
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,400
-I told him where you didn't wanna go.
-Yeah, and they sent me there.

528
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,200
I knew Rawls was pissed,
I didn't know how pissed.

529
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,000
What can I tell you?

530
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:10,000
-Where's Bunk?
-Out on a call with Crutchfield.

531
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,200
What's up with the girl?
She come off the bridge or what?

532
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,900
Doc Frazier posted her today.
Blunt-force trauma to the head and chest.

533
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
He says she's dead
before she hits the water.

534
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,300
What about the defense wounds?

535
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,800
Bruising on three fingers?
We saw that as soon as we picked her up.

536
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,700
You missed the defense wounds?

537
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,200
I wasn't looking.
Thought she went off the bridge.

538
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,500
Also, she's in the drink
with no coat or shoes.

539
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,100
Maybe that stuff comes off in the water,
maybe not.

540
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,400
I don't see her going to the bridge in winter
dressed like she was.

541
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,400
But then that's just me.

542
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,200
Tell Bunk I was here, will you?

543
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,500
Have fun.

544
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,200
We already had our fun.
Dumping her on Baltimore County.

545
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,800
On the County?

546
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,600
You fished her out east of the bridge.
That's Baltimore County. She's their stat.

547
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,800
-You sold them on that?
-Rawls did.

548
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,200
He called up the Colonel and said:

549
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,100
"You got one hell of a murder
on your hands."

550
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,400
It's all about self-preservation, Jimmy.

551
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,400
Something you never learned.

552
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,300
Hey, Norris. State Police, Line 2.

553
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,800
A little to the right!

554
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,400
Good, bring her down!

555
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,000
It's there whenever they want it.

556
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,500
Now that you are my client, Mr. Bell...

557
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,400
we are protected
by the attorney-client privilege.

558
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,500
-I thought Roberto would be here.
-Not likely.

559
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,500
This, I'm afraid, was in Monday's papers.

560
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,200
It seems Roberto Castellano y Silva
has been targeted by the DEA.

561
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,100
That's why we didn't do the business?

562
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,600
Right now, Roberto and his people aren't
going to be getting involved in anything...

563
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,000
that could further complicate the situation.

564
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,400
You know, usually, when you take a fall,
you get right back in there...

565
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,700
-'cause you know nobody's watching, right?
-Sometimes.

566
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,600
And sometimes you wonder
how it is you got caught in the first place.

567
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,300
And you decide to change the pattern.

568
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,900
He took our money?

569
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,100
Your advance payment arrived
as our problem did.

570
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,100
And I'm told the money
is on the way back to Baltimore.

571
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,700
You know, I get the feeling
that you're blaming us...

572
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,300
for Roberto's predicament.

573
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,600
Perhaps your problems in Baltimore
and my client's problems here...

574
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,300
are coincidental.

575
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,300
-But right now--
-Listen to me.

576
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,600
He was the first to know that we took a hit.

577
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,900
He knows no one came close
to rolling over us...

578
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,400
and all the documents from the case.

579
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,100
Nonetheless, we have a legitimate concern.

580
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,100
Considering the scope
of Mr. Barksdale's operation...

581
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,800
his sentence was, to say the least, mild.

582
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,500
But if the possibility exists,
however unlikely...

583
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,300
that the leniency he received
was the result of cooperation....

584
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,500
You understand our position, I'm sure.

585
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,600
Frank, it's sitting out there waiting...

586
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,800
and this Russian fuck
won't take it off the pier.

587
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,900
I ain't blind.

588
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,200
I don't like it
sitting out in the open that long.

589
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,800
The customs seal is broke.
Somebody's gonna see it.

590
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,100
Our asses are hanging out here.

591
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,500
-Yeah?
-Nicky, what the fuck? It's still here.

592
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,200
-Shit.
-Yeah.

593
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,800
-Where's Sergei?
-He's parked at the end of the lot.

594
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,500
-What's he waiting for?
-I got no fucking idea.

595
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,700
But the ship's almost empty.
They need to shit or get off the pot.

596
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,800
-I'll look into it.
-Yeah.

597
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,700
Okay, I understand.

598
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:57,000
Fuck it. Get it on a fifth wheel
and lose it in the stack. We're at risk.

599
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,800
I ain't lying when I say
this paperwork is kicking my ass.

600
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,900
Maybe so. But the end of the day,
you come through the door in one piece.

601
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,800
You like to think so.

602
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,600
But all these paper cuts
are starting to take their toll.

603
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,400
You big, nasty detective. Come here.

604
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,700
Let me give your little boo-boo a kiss.

605
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,000
-All this?
-I'm just getting started.

606
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,500
$1000 for the doctor.

607
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,500
$1000 each time, girlfriend.
Every month till I'm pregnant.

608
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,300
There's gotta be a better way.

609
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,700
That would be on you, sweetheart.

610
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,100
Come up with a suitable donor
and we pay a lot less.

611
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,000
Not with your pussy
would I fuck anyone of these guys.

612
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,300
What did you just say?
No, you didn't just say that.

613
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,900
Sergeant.

614
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,200
Your floater's come back.

615
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,100
County boys are putting her
on our side of the bridge.

616
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,100
-No fucking way.
-Yeah.

617
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,300
Some useless fuck in our Marine Unit
faxed them a report...

618
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,900
on the early morning tides
and wind currents.

619
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,500
Shows the body went in the water
west of the bridge and drifted out.

620
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,200
McNulty.

621
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,300
Fucking Jimmy.
Fucking with us for the fun of it.

622
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,700
I gotta give the son of a bitch
some credit for wit on this one.

623
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,500
-Cocksucker.
-Motherfucker.

624
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
The count is right. What's on the shelf?

625
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,800
Mace carrying 10 down here.
So, Moe Man holding about 38 up top.

626
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,800
I checked the stash, and we way low.

627
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,900
-Moe Man taking our shit.
-What he holding?

628
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,100
He say he holds about 30-something,
but I know that ain't right.

629
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,700
I'm gonna fuck him up.

630
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,900
First thing you think to do
is fuck a nigger up.

631
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,700
When your brick brain gonna realize
there's more to this...

632
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,900
than just thumpin' on niggers?

633
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
-What Moe supposed to be holding?
-38, thereabout.

634
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,000
-Ain't you the damn fool?
-But then we low.

635
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,100
Look, nigger, if we low,
it 'cause String want us that way.

636
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,900
When he wants us up, we be up.
String is on top of the shit.

637
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,300
He on top of everything.

638
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,100
Go back to your spot, man.

639
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,900
Fucking McNulty.

640
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,700
The Prince of Tides.

641
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,800
-Brother, you feeling strong today?
-Yeah.

642
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,500
See if you can get his ass out of that chair.

643
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,200
He said it was fine
if you wanted to hit him, too.

644
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,200
What's the first thing a guy from Local 47
does after he gets laid?

645
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,200
-What?
-Wipes the pepper spray from his eyes.

646
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,400
Hey, Frank. Something's going on.

647
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,100
-It's fucking girls, man. Young ones.
-There's a dozen of them.

648
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,900
Dead? They're dead?

649
00:56:55,305 --> 00:57:55,243

2
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:16,999
How is she?

3
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,453
In and out of
the morphine drip.

4
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:24,790
They got her stabilized
is all I know.

5
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,793
Go on in.

6
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,345
No.

7
00:00:30,381 --> 00:00:33,498
Unfreeze your ass
off that wall, then.

8
00:00:33,517 --> 00:00:35,601
Either pay
your respects

9
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,352
or get your head
back into this case.

10
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:39,972
Fuck this case.

11
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,173
Fuck it, huh?

12
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:42,274
Now you're just
gonna, what,

13
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,609
call off your
little crusade?

14
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:46,011
Is that what you
think it was?

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,279
A crusade?

16
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,314
<i>Avon Barksdale was</i>
<i>just a way for me</i>

17
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,783
to show everyone
how smart I was,

18
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:53,518
and how fucked up
the department is,
that's all.

19
00:00:53,537 --> 00:00:55,871
Just put Jimmy McNulty
up on your shoulders,

20
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:58,190
march him
around the room,

21
00:00:58,209 --> 00:01:00,876
break out the keg.

22
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:04,413
It was never about
Avon Barksdale, Lieutenant.

23
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,466
It was all
about me.

24
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,852
You think
I didn't know that?

25
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:12,871
You think we
all didn't know?

26
00:01:15,593 --> 00:01:19,711
Listen, this case
is gonna move forward,

27
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,847
with you
or without you.

28
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:22,981
This case
got her shot.

29
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:24,983
I put a battery
up her ass

30
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,102
and got her thinkin'
this case meant somethin'.

31
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,021
And you know what?

32
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:32,057
Burrell and Rawls and them,
they were right.

33
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:35,077
This case means
exactly shit.

34
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:37,029
Well, I know it meant
damn near nothing to me

35
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:39,114
when you came in
beating the drum.

36
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,284
But now we got that woman
in there, that good police,

37
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,069
breathin' through
a fucking tube,

38
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:45,704
because it meant
something to her.

39
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,123
And the shooters
who dropped Kima?

40
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,908
They're still
in the wind.

41
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:52,127
And whoever sent
those motherfuckers
into that alley,

42
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,745
he needs
to get got, too.

43
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:57,266
So, you can stand there
drippin' with liquor-smell

44
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:59,268
and self-pity
if you got a mind to.

45
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,302
But this case...

46
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:04,273
it means something,<i> now.</i>

00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:02,925
Yo, Poot!

73
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,010
200, maybe.

00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,064
What the fuck

75
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,600
What the fuck

Fish food.

76
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,853
Man, gimme my shit.

77
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,609
Hey, yo,

78
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,996
String.

79
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,563
I need your pagers.

80
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:27,165
All y'all,
the whole crew.

81
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:33,905
Who else?

82
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:35,740
Uh, Sterling,
Cass and Manny.

83
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,442
All right,
go get them shits.

84
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,211
How I'm gonna
talk to my girl?

85
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,096
<i>Talk to your hand, nigga,</i>
<i>that's the only girl you got.</i>

No more pagers.

89
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,423
Touts, lookouts,
off the air, all right?

90
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:52,975
Nobody gonna use
these cellphones

91
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:54,810
except for you
and Bodie,

92
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,696
and y'all ain't gonna
say shit on these cellphones,
you understand me?

93
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,532
<i>We got the numbers</i>
<i>and we the only niggas</i>
<i>that need the numbers.</i>

94
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,734
Not your moms,
not your girl, nobody.

95
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,102
You feel me?

96
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:05,787
You use these phones
to set up a meet,

97
00:05:05,823 --> 00:05:09,274
go to that meet,
and talk face
to face, period.

98
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:10,792
So, no more pay phones?

99
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:13,295
Nigga, you deaf?
I said no phones,
no phones.

100
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,380
Well, how I'm
gonna reach y'all?

101
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:19,835
All right, top number's
for re-ups,

102
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,920
second number's
for muscle.

103
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:24,423
<i>You need me, hit me</i>
<i>on the third number.</i>

104
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,224
Learn them shits,
then throw that shit away.

105
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,759
You doin' this
in the towers, too?

106
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:29,144
Doin' it
every goddamn place.

107
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:30,645
Pagers,
pay phones is dead.

108
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:32,264
<i>All right?</i>

109
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:33,565
Yeah.

110
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,351
Hey, yo, String.

111
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:38,970
We need some re-up, man,
we gonna tap out by noon.

112
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:40,138
Re-up from where?

113
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:41,656
Y'all niggas
ain't heard?

114
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,742
Knockos took
the main stash.

115
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,610
Why the fuck you think
we changin' up?

116
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:52,034
Back the fuck up,
youngun.

117
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,286
These shits
ain't for you.

118
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,206
All right.

119
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:03,628
Cool.
There you go.

120
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,331
There we go.

121
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,850
All right.

122
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:13,355
The gift of
corrected vision.

123
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,640
Compliments
of the BPD.

124
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,192
Dang, y'all are focused.

125
00:06:17,227 --> 00:06:19,528
What man
wouldn't be?

126
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:32,324
Excuse me.

127
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:37,379
<i>They been cleanin' us</i>
<i>for the past few days.</i>

128
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:39,381
Last night they
burned us all the way.

129
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,966
I knew it.
I fucking knew it.

130
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,668
I swear to God,
Lester, I'm in this
motherfucker's head.

131
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,670
Not a message
since early morning.

132
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,140
Shit, I even had
to cut Prez loose.

133
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,425
<i>Send his ass on down</i>
<i>to Annapolis.</i>

134
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,427
- For what?
- State campaign
finance reports.

135
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,179
<i>I checked all the stuff</i>
<i>here in the city.</i>

136
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,148
<i>But I got the feeling</i>
<i>Barksdale's money has legs.</i>

137
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,382
Aw, shit.

138
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:59,734
All the work we did
to get up on this fucking wire.

139
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,653
You don't hit these guys
the way we did

140
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,221
and expect them
to stay in the pocket.

141
00:07:03,273 --> 00:07:04,739
Plus, they know
they dropped a police.

142
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:06,408
Then we need
to change-up, too.

143
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:08,226
C'mon.

144
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:09,828
Shardene.

145
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,696
Honey, this is
Detective McNulty,

146
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,731
who's working with us.

147
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,699
<i>She works</i>
<i>at Orlando's,</i>

148
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,901
and she's been helping us out
there from time to time.

149
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,287
And now I think that
she can see well enough

150
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,839
to match faces
to voices.

151
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,374
Lester, look,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

152
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:23,708
I'm scared
of this shit.

153
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,378
Time comes, though,
I know you gonna step up.

154
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:29,548
We're gonna need Pearlman
to approve her wearing a wire.

155
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,416
Can I get
a cup of coffee?

156
00:07:31,435 --> 00:07:33,268
- What do you take in it?
- I'll get it.

157
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:35,387
A little cream,
right?

158
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:43,979
Those knockos motherfuckers
cleaned my shit out.

159
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,948
<i>You can replace product</i>
<i>and currency.</i>

160
00:07:46,984 --> 00:07:47,949
Yeah, he right.

161
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:49,701
We gotta focus
on what's real, here.

162
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,486
All of this
shit is real.
All of it!

163
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,405
They wanna
put me in a box.

164
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:56,374
Listen, I think what's
important is to take stock.

165
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,411
Ask yourself what's out there
that can still hurt you.

166
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:00,712
Where are you weak?

167
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,914
Where do you need
to clean up?

168
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,388
Think it through.

169
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,624
Start with Orlando.

170
00:08:12,643 --> 00:08:13,791
If Orlando rolled,

171
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,344
<i>you know he talked about</i>
<i>the club, at least.</i>

172
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,963
That punk-ass nigga ain't talked
about shit else but the club.

173
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:20,131
That's all
he knew about.

174
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,516
He wasn't rollin'
with us like that.

175
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:22,767
We kept him
on the outside.

176
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,437
Alright, so, you walk away
from the club.

177
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,072
You're not on the license,
you're not a listed owner.

178
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,973
They can't
make a connect.

179
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:31,142
Yo, when this shit
start up?

180
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:34,613
About the time that
your nephew beat that charge.

181
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:37,582
After, maybe.

182
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,618
When they found that witness
with the lead in his dome,

183
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,419
the shit hit
the newspapers.

184
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,505
But around that time,
the cops was on our shit.

185
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,207
<i>The security guard,</i>

186
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,259
<i>the one whose testimony</i>
<i>sprung D'Angelo--</i>

187
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,710
<i>Nakeisha Lyles.</i>

188
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,345
Bug-eyed ass bitch.

189
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,663
But we hooked that up.

190
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:53,548
So, she can still
hurt you, right?

191
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,966
Yeah.

192
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,019
The point is anybody
who can hurt you
can be put into play.

193
00:08:58,055 --> 00:09:00,672
The less I hear,
the better.

194
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:01,973
All right, yo.

195
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,942
Hey, yo,
lock that door.

196
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,278
Hey, yo,
lock that door.

197
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:11,950
So, we got
Bird and Bey.

198
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,735
Bird'll stand tall.

199
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:16,454
He already in jail
and Bey about to go too.

200
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,822
And Wee-Bey
hard like a rock.

201
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,242
And then
we got Savino.

202
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:22,911
Savino know it ain't nothin'
but an arm an' hammer charge,

203
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,163
I mean, he ain't
gonna flip out

204
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,631
over a motherfuckin'
three years.

205
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,799
True.

206
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,335
And then we got, uh, well,
that shit with Orlando,

207
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,836
and the only problem there
was Little Man.

208
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,472
Was.

209
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:36,007
- Was.
- Was.

210
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,010
Who else?

211
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,596
It's over,
your wire's cold.

212
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,482
The court orders give me a total
of 90 days on five phones.

213
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,318
<i>I'm doing</i>
<i>the full 90.</i>

214
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:49,688
You want to sit listening to
a bunch of broke-ass pay phones,

215
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,888
have at it.

216
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:53,074
But you don't need
all that manpower to do it.

217
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,827
You want some bodies back,
I'll send a couple, no problem.

218
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,245
Hold on, Lieutenant.

219
00:09:57,281 --> 00:09:58,896
I gave you
those people.

220
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:00,565
I decide
who comes back.

221
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:03,034
But feel free
to speak your mind.

222
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,853
If it<i> were</i> up to you.

223
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:08,256
He asked you a question,
Lieutenant.

224
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,843
I have no opinion.

225
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,244
Take your pick.

226
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:16,464
<i>What's the name of that</i>
<i>old detective from pawnshop?</i>

227
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:21,436
<i>And that young one,</i>
<i>Valchek's brain-dead</i>
<i>son-in-law.</i>

228
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:25,256
Freamon, Pryzbylewski.

229
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:27,309
Keep 'em.

230
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:31,146
<i>Send back Sydnor</i>
<i>and Santangelo.</i>

231
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:36,568
<i>And, Lieutenant,</i>
<i>if you want to do anything</i>

232
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,987
<i>beyond listen</i>
<i>to those dead phones,</i>

233
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,874
<i>you need</i>
<i>to brief me first, hmm?</i>

234
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,998
You did good,
Cedric.

235
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,633
<i>You play</i>
<i>your cards right,</i>

236
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:54,135
<i>all the work you did</i>
<i>over the past few months</i>

237
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:56,621
<i>will speak volumes</i>
<i>for you.</i>

238
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,256
And Major Spurgeon
is saying that

239
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,225
he's retiring
at the end of November.

240
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,959
<i>Which opens up</i>
<i>the Northwest command.</i>

241
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:03,645
- That's right.
-<i> Um-hm.</i>

242
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:08,433
Hi, Ronnie.
Come in.

243
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,634
Sit.

244
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:12,103
Sheila,
send Patrick in.

245
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,021
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

246
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,106
-<i> Anything up?</i>
- With me?

247
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,242
Same shit,
different file.

248
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,027
How about
the Barksdale thing?

249
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,612
<i>You've got</i>
<i>my office reports, right?</i>

250
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,146
Wire's dead,

251
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:23,782
but we're looking into a bug
in the man's nightclub.

252
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,583
<i>Well, aside from that,</i>
<i>you're doing what?</i>

253
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,420
<i>Pulling campaign</i>
<i>finance reports</i>

254
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,655
<i>for every politician in</i>
<i>the city of Baltimore, right?</i>

255
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,075
I am?
We are?

256
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,578
And making calls
to some contributors,

257
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,715
asking questions,
doing background checks.

258
00:11:40,751 --> 00:11:43,184
I don't know
anything about this.

259
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,637
I mean, Ronnie,
where the fuck
is all this going?

260
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:49,691
Those are public reports,
right?

261
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:51,276
I mean...

262
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,646
no one on that detail
has come to me for
any kind of subpoena.

263
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,681
<i>You've got back-doored,</i>
<i>too, huh?</i>

264
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,119
Well, just so there's
no misunderstanding,

265
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,988
I want to
give you this.

266
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,909
Copies of checks on the account
of my re-election committee,

267
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:11,629
<i>representing the return of</i>
<i>five separate contributions,</i>

268
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,164
<i>totaling $4,500.</i>

269
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,367
<i>Also, copies</i>
<i>of the checks</i>

270
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:18,470
<i>from the donor are</i>
<i>represented in there, too.</i>

271
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:21,089
Well, kinda like Caesar's wife
and all that shit.

272
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,225
The only thing that
we can come up with

273
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:25,894
were those five checks.

274
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:29,097
<i>And I don't know those people</i>
<i>and I don't know why they gave.</i>

275
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,900
<i>That money's gonna be returned</i>
<i>to the donors immediately.</i>

276
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:34,602
Guys, listen to me.

277
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:37,021
I don't know
a fucking thing

278
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,691
about anyone looking at
campaign contributions.

279
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:42,660
Be that as it may,

280
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:46,230
this should make it clear
that our hands are clean.

281
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:48,249
Ronnie, I want you
to take that back

282
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:51,669
to whoever's on the hunt
and I want you to tell 'em,

283
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:54,205
<i>they've got</i>
<i>no quarrel with me.</i>

284
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,712
- What's up, String?
- Yo.

285
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:07,101
So, y'all want
to get with me?

286
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:09,020
Yeah, we need
to holler at your boy,

287
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,439
you know, the one that
dimed on Omar's bitch.

288
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:13,274
Can't recall
his name.

289
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,593
Which one?

290
00:13:15,612 --> 00:13:18,396
You know, the one that was
at the Greek's that night.

291
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,064
And we paid him
for the lookout.

292
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,667
What y'all
need him for?

293
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,769
What's it to you?

294
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:26,704
You ain't got
to worry about him.

295
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,789
Say what?

296
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:29,741
He's gone,
he's out the game.

297
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,459
Out the game?

298
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:34,963
Yo, the man asked you
a simple question.

299
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:37,382
Look, I don't mean
y'all no disrespect.

300
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,967
You know I don't.

301
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:41,553
But I am sitting here
tellin' you that
the boy is out the game.

302
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,421
And even if he wasn't
out the game,

303
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,423
he wouldn't be
no problem.

304
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,226
But you know we just want
to talk to him, Dee.

305
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,631
Avon...

306
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,684
let the boy be.

307
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,943
Just let him be.

308
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:57,045
Honey, just leave
the damn thing alone.

309
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,746
Where'd you
get these, man?

310
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,364
Prevas.

311
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:01,666
Broadway market?

312
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,251
Best chili dogs
in the city.

313
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:04,919
<i>Naw, man, not even.</i>

314
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,739
<i>I'll give you 10 bucks</i>
<i>if you can name a better dog.</i>

315
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,391
<i>George's Lunch,</i>
<i>on Light Street.</i>

316
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:11,643
<i>The Greek joint?</i>

317
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,377
<i>They closed that place</i>
<i>back when you were still</i>

318
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:15,046
<i>suckin' on your</i>
<i>mama's nipples, man.</i>

319
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:16,347
<i>Your mama's nipples?</i>

320
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,899
<i>Was suckin' on</i>
<i>these plums last night.</i>

321
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:19,817
-<i> You owe me 10.</i>
-<i> Uh-uh.</i>

322
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,653
<i>I said to name a better dog</i>
<i>you can have today,</i>

323
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:22,854
<i>not in world history.</i>

324
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:24,355
<i>You just said</i>
<i>a better dog, dawg.</i>

325
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:25,690
<i>Can you go get</i>
<i>that dog right now?</i>

326
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,408
<i>You cannot go get</i>
<i>that dog right now.</i>

327
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:28,993
<i>You said</i>
<i>the best fucking dog.</i>

328
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,244
<i>Physically,</i>
<i>physically--</i>

329
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,329
Will you Ivy Leaguers
please keep it down?

330
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,615
I can't hear
a goddamn thing!

331
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,458
<i>You'd know how much I got</i>
<i>if you laid somethin' on me.</i>

332
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,410
<i>Oh, you like</i>
<i>that freeze, huh?</i>

333
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,761
If you holdin'.

334
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:47,929
I'm fixin' to be.

335
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:49,297
That's why I'm here,
you know...

336
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,582
<i>to discuss some things.</i>

337
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:54,418
Well, when you
done discussin',

338
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:56,137
you come back.

339
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,943
All right, then.

340
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:04,195
<i>Hold that pose</i>
<i>right there, shorty.</i>

341
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,748
<i>I'ma hook you up</i>
<i>with some uncut.</i>

342
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:10,868
Yo, y'all niggas
talk too damn much, man.

343
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:19,827
Who the fuck
is she?

344
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,412
Housing police?

345
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:25,416
Naw, she's one of
them civilians they got
doin' security.

346
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:27,802
Housing cops wear
the grey uniforms.

347
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:29,754
<i>So, she's not armed</i>
<i>or nothin'.</i>

348
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,288
Do she look it?

349
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,312
You leavin' early.

350
00:16:38,348 --> 00:16:41,599
I was early,
I worked the lunch crowd.

351
00:16:52,162 --> 00:16:54,195
She's out.

352
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:57,165
Anything?

353
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,250
Table scraps.

354
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,818
What we want is being
said in that office,

355
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:02,704
and there ain't no good reason
for Shardene to be in there

356
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,372
long enough
for us to get it.

357
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,009
Take it out,
I can't do this anymore.

358
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:09,711
You won't have to,
darlin'.

359
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:11,262
I think they're gonna look
at me and they're gonna know.

360
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,597
I need to quit.

361
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,682
I don't need you wearin'
this wire, all right, honey?

362
00:17:14,718 --> 00:17:18,886
I just need you to go in there
and do one more thing.

363
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,806
Oh, lookit this
country nigga.

364
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,226
Damn, Wallace.

365
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,861
Wally!

366
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,314
He kept cryin'
'til I sent him bus money.

367
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,817
All right, yo, I just got
tired of that same ole,

368
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:36,370
same ole country scenery,
it was just too slow for me, yo.

369
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:38,990
Yeah, but did you get
some of that country ass?

370
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,242
And if he did,
it was on four legs.

371
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,960
Nigga, there wasn't
no farms down there, man,

372
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,746
but they did have
some bamas though, man.

373
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,166
They got their Saturday night
shit down at, down at Sears.

374
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,717
They was like,
you know.

375
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:51,803
Tears, right?.
You were about to cry.

376
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:53,121
That where you got them
die-hards, right there?

377
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,422
Man, these Timbs.

378
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,057
Yeah, they Timbs, man.

379
00:17:56,092 --> 00:17:57,842
I can see the tree
on the side of 'em.

380
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,927
So, you gonna put me
back on the money?

381
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,346
<i>Hold, hold.</i>

382
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,548
Look, if we do
put you back on,

383
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:06,734
you gonna have to start out
as lookout, man.

384
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,903
<i>You lost your spot</i>
<i>when you bucked town, dawg.</i>

385
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:12,023
I mean, c'mon, a real man'd
stay with his people,

386
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,058
he wouldn't run
at the first sight
of some blood, you know.

387
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:16,077
Y'all can still holler
five-o, right?

388
00:18:16,112 --> 00:18:18,279
If he want back on the money,
he back on the money.

389
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,397
<i>If he want it.</i>

390
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,251
<i>My man might be thinkin' about</i>
<i>goin' back to Edmondson,</i>

391
00:18:23,286 --> 00:18:25,536
like we talked about,
right?

392
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,742
C'mon, nigga,
let's walk.

393
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:35,096
Dawg, you ain't cornhole
no animal for real, did you?

394
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:37,849
Go 'head, Poot.

395
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,351
Yo, don't be fuckin'
with my Sean John.

396
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:43,054
<i>So who caught it?</i>

397
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,722
<i>Garvey.</i>

398
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,590
He knows about
the whole witness angle,

399
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:48,392
but he doesn't want
to run it up to the bosses

400
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,027
until he knows more.

401
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:51,946
Why ace
Nakeisha Lyles now?

402
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:54,598
Because now they know
we're for real.

403
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,534
Avon's cleaning house
all the way.

404
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,436
First the phones
go dead,

405
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,822
<i>and then anyone he thinks</i>
<i>we might be able to flip.</i>

406
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:08,412
What about the boy?

407
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,048
Fuck me.

408
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,837
We took him down
to the shore on a Friday

409
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:16,971
and the plan was
to bring him back up

410
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:18,389
on the Monday
for the grand jury.

411
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,975
- And what happened?
- Greggs got shot.

412
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,393
Trooper Reese?

413
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,846
This is Lieutenant Daniels
with the Baltimore department.

414
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,964
Is there someone that can
take a run out near Cambridge,

415
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:28,966
<i>check on a kid</i>
<i>we got stashed down there?</i>

416
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,352
-<i> Why don't you call him?</i>
-<i> No, there's no phone</i>
<i>where he's staying.</i>

417
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,487
-<i> Can you hang on?</i>
- I'll hold, yeah.

418
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:35,990
Have Sydnor pull a car
from motor pool.

419
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:37,859
We get the kid
back up here tonight,

420
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:41,779
he sleeps on my sofa,
and we grand-jury him
in the morning.

421
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,647
What about
your stripper?

422
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,832
The woman's
got heart.

423
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:47,151
I mean,
I want her protected.

424
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,536
No more bodies, hear?

425
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:51,339
Well, I got room at my place,
she can lay up with me.

426
00:19:51,374 --> 00:19:53,090
I got no problem
with that.

427
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:54,825
Remember who you are,
Detective.

428
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:57,678
Protect and serve,
Lieutenant.

429
00:19:57,714 --> 00:19:59,931
Protect and serve.

430
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:03,184
I'm sayin',
this here game,

431
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:04,719
it ain't gonna work
for you no more, man.

432
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:08,723
You leavin',
you stirred up some shit.

433
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:11,225
I'm sayin' it ain't
your fault or nothin'.

434
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,443
Yo, Dee, look.

435
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,278
I appreciate what you
tryin' to say and all,

436
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,513
but I grew up
in the Courts, all right?

437
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:18,065
I been with
them niggas since...

438
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,984
since, shit,
forever.

439
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:24,071
I guess this is home,
right?

440
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,190
You ain't hearin' me,
Wallace.

441
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:28,492
You ain't hearin' me.

442
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,578
Anybody ask you
whether you in this game,

443
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,080
you tell them you in it
for life, all right?

444
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,916
You play it hard,
you play it tight

445
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:37,701
and make sure
niggas know you gonna
stand by your people.

446
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,205
No loose talk,
no second thoughts,
and no snitchin'.

447
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:44,175
Play it like that.

448
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:52,934
Hey.

449
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,518
What you doin' down
in the PJs, you lost?

450
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:55,886
I'm lookin'
for you.

451
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:57,054
You know I be
down here workin'.

452
00:20:57,073 --> 00:20:59,190
You know a working man
got to eat.

453
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:03,361
My favorite
spicy fish cakes?

454
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,946
On the saltines
with the mustard.

455
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,747
You gonna make me cry,
you know.

456
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:08,866
I need to get up outta here
and get back to it.

457
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,903
- You be safe.
- You, too.

458
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:14,038
All right.

459
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:18,409
This here.

460
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:20,577
Sterling's, baby.

461
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:21,879
We about to feast.

462
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,381
What the hell
is Sterling's?

463
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,599
Sterling's, you know
up on 29th Street?

464
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:26,851
Don't you
know nothin'?

465
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,386
Shit, if it ain't
up on the Westside,

466
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,804
I don't know shit, yo.

467
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:32,223
'Cause this shit,
this is me, yo.

468
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,524
Right here.

469
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:37,028
Who was that, your new girl
or somethin'?

470
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:39,313
Nah, nigga,
that's my mom.

471
00:21:47,156 --> 00:21:49,323
You know
Senator Davis?

472
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,158
No, sir.

473
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,277
Lieutenant.

474
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:55,379
Clay wanted
to meet you,

475
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:58,499
<i>see if there was</i>
<i>any help he can offer.</i>

476
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:01,752
Help?

477
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:05,139
Your people are apparently
pulling finance reports

478
00:22:05,174 --> 00:22:07,925
and checking up on some
of the contributors.

479
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,628
I wanted to reassure you
on that front.

480
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,647
I'm not involved
in drugs, Lieutenant.

481
00:22:14,851 --> 00:22:16,300
Good.

482
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,819
And this business
with the senator's driver.

483
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:21,856
Mr. Price.
Damien.

484
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,741
Day-Day.

485
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,309
This uh...

486
00:22:25,328 --> 00:22:29,447
business with Mr. Price,
this is a misunderstanding

487
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,648
that is really of
no concern to the police.

488
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:35,703
He had $20,000
of cash on him,

489
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:39,023
delivered out of a project tower
by a known drug suspect.

490
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,992
<i>The money was banded</i>
<i>and manicured by denomination.</i>

491
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:43,994
This is...

492
00:22:44,013 --> 00:22:46,663
there's no crime here.

493
00:22:46,682 --> 00:22:49,967
That was money that Damien
already had on him

494
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,719
when he drove down
to Franklin Terrace.

495
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:54,555
Money from
a cash bar fund raiser
the previous weekend.

496
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,359
We filed an amended
finance report that shows--

497
00:22:58,394 --> 00:23:01,278
Fine.

498
00:23:01,314 --> 00:23:05,232
There's no probable cause
for a search of Mr. Price.

499
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:07,318
I think we are
in agreement on that.

500
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:10,121
No, there was PC
for the search.

501
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,539
You're saying
you have evidence

502
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:14,542
that a senatorial aide
is involved in drugs?

503
00:23:14,577 --> 00:23:17,828
I'm saying, we had reason
to stop Mr. Price

504
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,580
and effect
a body search,

505
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:23,801
after which we discovered
$20,000 in cash in banded,
manicured bills.

506
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,469
That's all I'm saying.

507
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:28,556
Erv, will you explain
to this motherfucker

508
00:23:28,591 --> 00:23:30,307
just what the fuck it is
he's doing here?

509
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:31,392
Lieutenant Daniels--

510
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:32,643
Excuse me, sir.

511
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,045
<i>But it's pretty basic.</i>

512
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:37,381
If the senator is not involved
in anything illegal,

513
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,599
then he doesn't
need to worry.

514
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,901
I can't be any clearer
about it than that.

515
00:23:40,937 --> 00:23:42,570
<i>Fool, what do you think?</i>

516
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:44,822
<i>That we know anything</i>
<i>about who gives money?</i>

517
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:49,026
<i>That we give a damn</i>
<i>about who they are</i>
<i>or what they want?</i>

518
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:52,663
<i>We have no way of running</i>
<i>down them or their stories.</i>

519
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,398
<i>We don't care.</i>

520
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:57,785
We just cash the damn checks,
count the votes and move on.

521
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:04,041
Anything else,
Deputy Burrell?

522
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,180
Gentlemen.

523
00:24:15,271 --> 00:24:17,721
Motherfucker, you need
to put his ass on a footpost

524
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,306
so far out
in the sticks

525
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:22,092
that he gonna see
the Philadelphia cops
walkin' towards him.

526
00:24:22,111 --> 00:24:25,112
Now, you ain't just
talkin' to me now, Erv.

527
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:27,931
You talkin'
to the mayor,

528
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,601
<i>the city caucus,</i>
<i>the state central committee.</i>

529
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,571
<i>And right now,</i>
<i>you got your hand</i>
<i>in our pocket.</i>

530
00:24:33,623 --> 00:24:35,122

Yeah!

536
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,252
Detective Sergeant Hauk
reporting for duty, sir.

537
00:24:50,673 --> 00:24:53,090
And the best part?
Carver's 37.

538
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,227
<i>"You know, it helps if you</i>
<i>know 'em by the numbers.</i>

539
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:58,262
It makes you sound
more professional.

540
00:24:58,347 --> 00:24:59,763
Fucking Carver.

541
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,298
He gets back from
in-service training,

542
00:25:01,317 --> 00:25:02,766
he's gonna
kiss the stripes,

543
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,518
I'm gonna make him
kiss the the strips.

544
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,320
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

545
00:25:06,355 --> 00:25:07,905
Appreciate it.

546
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,159
Sergeant Hauk?

547
00:25:12,195 --> 00:25:14,778
God help us.

548
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,033
Daniels.

549
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:20,651
<i>Yeah, Daniels,</i>
<i>this is Trooper Reese.</i>

550
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,920
<i>Grandmother says the kid's</i>
<i>been gone two days.</i>

551
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,256
Wallace is
out of pocket.

552
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,790
Two days.

553
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:30,211
- Thanks.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

554
00:25:35,685 --> 00:25:37,501
Ain't no re-up
in the towers, neither?

555
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,853
Naw, shop dead, yo.

556
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:41,639
All right.

557
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,658
What up, man?

558
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,392
Same ole, same ole.

559
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:04,528
What's up
with that boy?

560
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,780
Aw, man.

561
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:09,033
He's just a punk,
that's all.

562
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,619
Dee put him back
on the count though.

563
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:12,870
Oh, word?

564
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,955
I heard he was
out the game.

565
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,291
He was,
but he back now.

566
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:19,409
Where he been at?

567
00:26:19,428 --> 00:26:21,929
Down his granny house,
he says.

568
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:25,182
Right,
his granny house.

569
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,385
I heard he damn near
shit his pants

570
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:30,688
when he saw what happened
to Omar's bitch.

571
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:33,991
He just ain't built
for this, you know.

572
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,409
His heart pump
Kool-Aid.

573
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:37,060
Right.

574
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,746
What about you?

575
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:41,532
You built
for this shit?

576
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,535
No doubt.

577
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,706
You ready
to put the work in?

578
00:26:51,794 --> 00:26:53,544
You got heat?

579
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:03,854
All right, soldier.

580
00:27:40,643 --> 00:27:43,177
It's clear upstairs.

581
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:56,106
No extension cords.

582
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,442
- No juice boxes.
- No Wallace.

583
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:01,144
Dag, boy,

584
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:04,815
Chink Bob's never be puttin'
no napkins in the bag.

585
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:07,818
Motherfucker,
because napkins
expensive and shit.

586
00:28:07,837 --> 00:28:09,152
So is my money.

587
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:12,256
A'ight, c'mon, go,
somethin' to eat?

588
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,625
Y'all know what's here.

589
00:28:16,011 --> 00:28:18,161
Let's go, y'all need to get
up in this Chinese food.

590
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,549
'cause, you know, I'm lookin'
kinda needy right about now.

591
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:26,103
What you
listenin' to?

592
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,688
Hold up,
take them plates first.

593
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:30,140
Big Tymers, their new video
on "106 and Park".

594
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,392
106 and Park?

595
00:28:31,444 --> 00:28:32,509
- The joint is vicious.
- It's vicious?

596
00:28:32,528 --> 00:28:33,560
- Yeah.
- For real?

597
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:34,678
What they call you,
little man?

598
00:28:34,697 --> 00:28:35,979
<i>Buff, 'cause</i>
<i>I got the stuff.</i>

599
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,531
- You got the stuff?
- Yeah.

600
00:28:37,566 --> 00:28:40,117
Well, Buff, you need
to get up in these
eggrolls or somethin'.

601
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:43,237
Any word
on the kid?

602
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,906
I rolled around Cambridge
all night with his "B" of "I".

603
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,792
If he's down there,
he ain't got no profile.

604
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,378
We got lookouts to every car
in the western and central,

605
00:28:51,414 --> 00:28:53,330
and we're trying for
an address on his mother.

606
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,166
Detective.

607
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,968
Lieutenant.

608
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,553
Wire's dead,

609
00:28:59,588 --> 00:29:01,705
so we've been ordered
to begin sending bodies home.

610
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:04,174
<i>Sydnor we have a little longer,</i>
<i>because Cantrell still owes me.</i>

611
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,177
You okay
with Rawls?

612
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,762
I gave him
his clearance, right?

613
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:10,230
What's he gonna
do to me?

614
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:13,016
Keep it warm,
Sanny.

615
00:29:19,074 --> 00:29:20,090
What's that?

616
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,992
Plans for what
is now Orlando's.

617
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,243
The upper floors.

618
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,745
<i>This is the property</i>
<i>next door.</i>

619
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,030
<i> How'd you get</i>
<i>them so quick?</i>
<i>-  Costar search.</i>

620
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,399
Plan is to get a remote mic
into the office.

621
00:29:29,418 --> 00:29:31,251
Maybe even some
fiber-optics.

622
00:29:31,287 --> 00:29:33,837
<i>- Only we don't know where</i>
<i>- Avon's office is yet.</i>

623
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:35,956
Which is where Shardene
helps us out in a big way.

624
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:39,409
What she gonna do?
Take out a tape measure and ask
Avon to hold the other end?

625
00:29:39,428 --> 00:29:41,261
Ain't none-a y'all ever
been in the military?

626
00:29:41,297 --> 00:29:44,431
How do you learn
a 30 inch, quick-time?

627
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:51,221
Draft-dodgin',
peace-freaks, huh?

628
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:54,224
Get me a ruler
and some string.

629
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,726
Why me?

630
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,537
Why? Why?

631
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,071
Because the man
said so, that's why.

632
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,790
Wallace
ain't no snitch.

633
00:30:09,825 --> 00:30:11,158
Man, how you know?

634
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,109
How you know where
he been runnin' to?

635
00:30:13,128 --> 00:30:15,111
He was gettin' high.

636
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,780
I seen him cop.

637
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,417
He probably went
down to the shore
to clean that shit up.

638
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:23,720
Man, if he usin',
then you know
he ain't reliable.

639
00:30:23,756 --> 00:30:25,172
C'mon, think.

640
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:27,674
Look, the man gave
the word, all right?

641
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:30,260
We either step up
or we step the fuck off.

642
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:33,730
That's the game, yo.

643
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:36,400
That's the fucking game.

into the details
of our investigation.

I know,
it's annoying.

651
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,471
But what the hell
are you guys doing?

652
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,640
Yeah?

653
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,642
Is that Avon's money?

654
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:24,531
Eastside addresses,

655
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:26,483
but maybe Barksdale has fronts
we don't know about.

656
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,118
State's attorney's

Why didn't you
tell me?

660
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,742
Aren't you better off
that we didn't?

661
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:00,984
I remember my mom
used to bring me in here.

662
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,153
We used to go to this place
called Fruit Fantasy.

663
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:04,738
Like orange soda,
some shit like that?

664
00:32:04,773 --> 00:32:06,389
Naw, these shits
was fresh.

665
00:32:06,408 --> 00:32:08,892
My mom used to pour
mad Bacardi in hers though.

666
00:32:08,911 --> 00:32:10,577
<i>Wasn't much she didn't</i>
<i>pour it into.</i>

667
00:32:10,613 --> 00:32:11,912

sittin' here,

668
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,530
talkin' about your momma
like you still a kid.

669
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:15,398
Well, I got
to thinkin' on her.

670

So what're you,
a boy or a man?

673
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,512
I'm a man.

674
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,602

00:32:58,627 --> 00:33:00,210
...it's the second room

The stairs start
30 paces from the front,

00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:48,151
- Which one?
<i> The rental there,</i>
<i>the Taurus.</i>

776
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:56,709
I gotta say,
Lieutenant,

777
00:39:56,745 --> 00:39:59,045
you got mad suction
with the federales.

778
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,656
Yeah, Daniels.

779
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:32,895
Yeah.

780
00:40:32,914 --> 00:40:34,948
Where?

781
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:40,170
Wallace?

782
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:25,014
Poor fucking kid.

783
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:30,220
With Wallace gone,
that's Stringer out
of the box.

784
00:41:40,515 --> 00:41:43,266
<i>He was in there changing</i>
<i>his fucking clothes.</i>

785
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,737
<i>You believe that?</i>

786
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:50,023
Boy had to get
himself correct.

787
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,216
We're on.

788
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:01,868
No need
for an eyeball.

789
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,753
<i>Let the satellite</i>
<i>do the work.</i>

790
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:19,852
How 'bout
I call my lawyer,

791
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:25,975
have him explain that whole
profilin' thing to you.

792
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,361
Mr. Barksdale,
our toll booth cameras

793
00:42:28,396 --> 00:42:31,114
have you on the G.W. Bridge
at 23:10 hours,

794
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:33,700
<i>and then re-entering</i>
<i>the turnpike at the same exit</i>

795
00:42:33,735 --> 00:42:35,285
<i>35 minutes later.</i>

796
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,038
<i>Why did you drive all the way</i>
<i>to New York for half an hour?</i>

797
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:41,491
Step out of
the car, sir.

798
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:44,327
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

799
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:47,130
Turn around, face the car,
put your hands on the roof.

800
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:49,499
Are you carrying
any weapons, sir?

801
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:51,167
- No.
- Any knives, any needles?

802
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:54,420
-<i> No.</i>
-<i> Any illegal substances</i>
<i>I should know about?</i>

803
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:55,838
Okay.

804
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,340
Spread your
legs back.

805
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,175
Spread your legs
back more.

806
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:05,881
Okay, slowly bring your
right arm around your back.

807
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,184
<i>Now bring</i>
<i>the other one.</i>

808
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:24,784
- Remember me?
- Lawyer.

809
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:26,953
Easy. We're just
getting started.

810
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:28,588
Lawyer,
motherfucker.

811
00:43:28,623 --> 00:43:31,424
Okay, so you're hard,
but guess what?

812
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:33,259
- I could give a fuck.
- You?

813
00:43:33,295 --> 00:43:34,744
I'm tired
of your games.

814
00:43:34,763 --> 00:43:37,313
What, you want me
to write a letter,
or some shit like that?

815
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:39,098
No game
we need to run.

816
00:43:39,134 --> 00:43:41,017
You're popped
with a kilo of uncut.

817
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:43,136
Not that you
messed up.

818
00:43:43,188 --> 00:43:44,604
I mean, you did
everything right.

819
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:46,556
Speed limit, turn signals,
working taillights.

820
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:48,257
Question
you gotta ask is,

821
00:43:48,276 --> 00:43:50,827
how'd those troopers
know to pull you over?

822
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:53,396
Someone else fucked up,
you followin' me?

823
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:55,281
But it's you
they're gonna blame

824
00:43:55,317 --> 00:43:56,966
and you who's gonna
do the jolt.

825
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:59,218
Lawyer.

826
00:43:59,254 --> 00:44:01,287
That'd be Levy,
right?

827
00:44:01,323 --> 00:44:04,774
He's gettin' paid
by your uncle, is that right?

828
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:08,578
<i>Oh, yeah, he's looking out</i>
<i>for your interests.</i>

829
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:10,079
More than you.

830
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:12,615
Listen...

831
00:44:12,634 --> 00:44:15,501
I ain't sayin'
another damn thing

832
00:44:15,553 --> 00:44:18,805
to nobody
but my lawyer.

833
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:27,296
Oh, by the way,
your boy Wallace?

834
00:44:27,315 --> 00:44:29,065
Shot dead
in the low-rises.

835
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,634
That's how y'all take care
of your own, right?

836
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:35,488
You're a lyin'
motherfucker.

837
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:38,274
So, what, what?

838
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:40,476
You want me to write
a letter to his mom, too?

839
00:44:40,495 --> 00:44:43,446
Get the fuck
outta here.

840
00:44:58,046 --> 00:45:00,430
<i>You ain't have to send him</i>
<i>the way you did.</i>

841
00:45:01,683 --> 00:45:03,549
<i>In one car?</i>

842
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:05,351
<i>He should've been</i>
<i>trailin' a mule.</i>

843
00:45:05,387 --> 00:45:07,920
<i>95 or on the train,</i>
<i>it don't make no difference,</i>

844
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:09,439
<i>he shouldn't have</i>
<i>been out there alone.</i>

845
00:45:09,474 --> 00:45:10,940
Look here, Brianna--

846
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,809
Ain't you ever heard
of a trap-car?

847
00:45:12,844 --> 00:45:16,979
You send my son to New York
in a motherfuckin' rental

848
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,515
and then you just let him ride
with that package in the trunk?

849
00:45:19,534 --> 00:45:20,783
I'm sorry
it went like it did.

850
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,618
<i>Sorry ain't gonna bring</i>
<i>that boy out of prison.</i>

851
00:45:22,654 --> 00:45:25,571
Just better make sure
that Jew lawyer of yours
earns his money, a'ight?

852
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:28,241
D'Angelo gonna have
to do his part.

853
00:45:28,293 --> 00:45:29,709
Meaning what?

854
00:45:29,744 --> 00:45:31,544
You like the car
you drivin' there, right?

855
00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:33,329
You like this crib?

856
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:35,248
I put you in this crib.
You like it?

857
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,718
Yeah, meaning, we all
got a lot to protect here.

858
00:45:38,753 --> 00:45:40,219
You need to remind him
of that.

859
00:45:40,255 --> 00:45:42,755
<i>So, when it come down to it,</i>
<i>he can stand up tall.</i>

860
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,264
You ain't gotta
worry about my child,

861
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:54,049
I raised that boy,

862
00:45:54,068 --> 00:45:56,235
and I raised him right.

863
00:46:04,446 --> 00:46:07,246
It wasn't me
who fucked up.

864
00:46:07,282 --> 00:46:08,765
Oh, really?

865
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,833
So, who did?

866
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:12,234
Why the fuck
are we here?

867
00:46:12,253 --> 00:46:13,903
Listen,
all you need to do

868
00:46:13,922 --> 00:46:15,371
is keep your head
through the bail hearing,

869
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:17,740
we got a good shot
at bringing you home here.

870
00:46:17,759 --> 00:46:20,259
Then what, hmm?

871
00:46:20,295 --> 00:46:22,712
Who gonna take the weight
for all the shit

872
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:24,697
in the trunk
of that car?

873
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,020
Where's Wallace at?

874
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:38,060
Where's the boy,
String?

875
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:42,148
D'Angelo,
shut your mouth.

876
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:46,435
Where's Wallace?

877
00:46:46,454 --> 00:46:48,771
That's all
I want to know.

878
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,607
Kid, you better think.

879
00:46:51,626 --> 00:46:55,161
Where the fuck
is Wallace, huh?

880
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:56,796
String?! String?!

881
00:46:56,831 --> 00:46:59,281
Look at me.
Look at me!

882
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,217
Where the fuck
is Wallace, huh?!

883
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,836
I don't want this
Pay Less-wearin' motherfucker
representin' me.

884
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:05,755
I'ma get my own man,
all right?

885
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,173
<i>So, just get back</i>
<i>in your car</i>

886
00:47:07,225 --> 00:47:10,476
and get the fuck
back down south.

887
00:47:10,512 --> 00:47:12,294
All right, you stupid
motherfucker.

888
00:47:12,313 --> 00:47:13,596
You made
your decision.

889
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,815
Yeah,
I made my decision.
Where's Wallace at?

890
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:17,066
Where the fuck
is Wallace?

891
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:19,318
<i>Where's Wallace,</i>
<i>String?!</i>

892
00:47:19,354 --> 00:47:22,772
<i>String, where the fuck</i>
<i>is Wallace?</i>

893
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:24,156
<i>Huh?!</i>
<i>Stringer!</i>

894
00:47:24,192 --> 00:47:26,576
<i>- Bring him in.</i>
<i>- You're done.</i>

895
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:27,977
Why?

896
00:47:27,996 --> 00:47:29,645
We have the charge
whenever we want it.

897
00:47:29,664 --> 00:47:32,164
Why not stay up on the bug
we've got in his office?

898
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,750
<i>The bug you didn't</i>
<i>brief me about.</i>

899
00:47:34,786 --> 00:47:38,671
I thought your little bird
told you everything we did,

900
00:47:38,706 --> 00:47:40,006
a minute after we did it.

901
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,757
One of our people
got hurt.

902
00:47:41,793 --> 00:47:43,209
That's supposed
to mean something.

903
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:44,760
<i>We're hunting</i>
<i>her shooters,</i>

904
00:47:44,796 --> 00:47:47,713
and by the grace of God
and your good work,

905
00:47:47,765 --> 00:47:50,883
we've got a viable case
on our main target.

906
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:54,503
<i>Just charge Barksdale</i>
<i>with the attempt purchase</i>

907
00:47:54,522 --> 00:47:56,522
from New York
and bring it all home.

908
00:47:56,558 --> 00:47:58,474
And what about Stringer,
his number two?

909
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:00,342
He slipped off the hook
when we lost the boy witness.

910
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:02,612
We've done
all we can.

911
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,564
Are you hearing me?

912
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:08,034
These are the people responsible
for dropping a police.

913
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:09,351
Not just the shooters,

914
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,203
<i>but the ones who</i>
<i>make the dirt happen.</i>

915
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:12,989
I'm trying to put
them down for real,

916
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:14,356
not for some
short-time bit.

917
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:17,877
That all you're
trying to do?

918
00:48:17,912 --> 00:48:19,996
<i>If that's all</i>
<i>you're trying to do,</i>

919
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:22,331
<i>how is it you have people</i>
<i>pulling campaign records</i>

920
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,050
and finance reports?

921
00:48:24,085 --> 00:48:26,419
The fuck has that got
to do with anything?!

922
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:28,838
The money is part
of my case.

923
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:31,373
There might've been
a time when I was willing

924
00:48:31,392 --> 00:48:33,759
to say otherwise to let
you and all your friends

925
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:35,428
<i>hide some of that dirt.</i>
<i>But not now.</i>

926
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,229
You want to talk
about dirt?

927
00:48:37,265 --> 00:48:38,898
Have at it.

928
00:48:38,933 --> 00:48:40,883
<i>Talk some shit about</i>
<i>your Eastern District days.</i>

929
00:48:40,902 --> 00:48:42,735
Talk some shit about
what was going on back

930
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:44,887
when you was runnin' wild
in the DEU.

931
00:48:44,906 --> 00:48:47,156
That's just talk.

932
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:48,357
Just talk?

933
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:58,534
FBI field reports.

934
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:01,871
You came into
a lot of money, quick.

935
00:49:03,257 --> 00:49:04,957
<i>And you can go to jail</i>
<i>just as quick,</i>

936
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:08,678
if I start asking
the right questions.

937
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:11,580
<i>This case ends</i>
<i>or you are done.</i>

938
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,300
<i>Hell, I don't even need you</i>
<i>to lock up Barksdale.</i>

939
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:16,969
<i>I'll have your major</i>
<i>debrief your detectives</i>

940
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:19,105
<i>and type</i>
<i>the warrants himself.</i>

941
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,274
This case is done!

942
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,813
You do what you feel.

943
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:30,432
You wanna pull Avon
in on half a case?

944
00:49:30,451 --> 00:49:32,118
You go ahead.

945
00:49:32,153 --> 00:49:33,653
You wanna put my shit
in the street?

946
00:49:33,705 --> 00:49:35,270
Feel free.

947
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:37,540
But the Eastern
had a lot of stories.

948
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:38,874
Mine ain't
the only one.

949
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:41,577
A lot of people came
through that district.

950
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:44,964
If you were gonna do me,
I'd already be done.

951
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:48,801
But there ain't nothing you
fear more than a bad headline,

952
00:49:48,836 --> 00:49:50,086
now, is there?

953
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:51,453
You'd rather
live in shit

954
00:49:51,472 --> 00:49:53,889
than let the world
see you work a shovel.

955
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:56,959
You can order warrants,
and I'll serve them.

956
00:49:56,978 --> 00:50:00,146
But as long as I have days
left on those dead wires,

957
00:50:00,181 --> 00:50:02,515
this case goes on.

958
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:16,979
Yo, look at these Delta
Force, motherfuckers, man.

959
00:50:16,998 --> 00:50:19,615
- I mean, look at them.
- All right.

960
00:50:21,169 --> 00:50:22,451
<i>What's up with Levy?</i>

961
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,286
He said he gonna
meet us down there.

962
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:27,006
Damn. I still didn't get
this safe outta here yet, man.

963
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:28,174
How much money
in it?

964
00:50:28,209 --> 00:50:29,542
150.

965
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:31,160
- 150.
- Yeah.

966
00:50:31,179 --> 00:50:32,795
Well, open it up, man.

967
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,797
No sense in ruining
a good safe.

968
00:50:53,618 --> 00:50:55,868
This isn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

969
00:50:55,903 --> 00:50:58,988
The SWAT guys do love
to break out their
toys, don't they?

970
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:00,706
They think it's
Tony Montana up there?

971
00:51:00,742 --> 00:51:02,291
These guys probably haven't
touched a gun in years.

972
00:51:05,546 --> 00:51:07,362
Aw, fuck this shit.

973
00:51:07,381 --> 00:51:09,665
You and me,
Lieutenant.

974
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,755
<i>What units are</i>
<i>in the alley?</i>

975
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:19,592
<i>Any sight line</i>
<i>to the rear door?</i>

976
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:22,561
<i>10-four,</i>
<i>who has the roof?</i>

977
00:51:23,648 --> 00:51:25,848
We're going to move in
on my command.

978
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:27,683
Everyone stand by.

979
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:30,853
We're not going
to need your men today.
Call 'em back.

980
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:33,239
- Now, just wait a minute.
- My case, back your men off.

981
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:32,681
Catch ya later.

982
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:50,793
Good.

983
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:55,965
Barksdale's
wearing bracelets.

984
00:53:57,385 --> 00:54:00,135
Still no Wee-Bey,
no Little Man?

985
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:02,588
No, nothing there.

986
00:54:12,984 --> 00:54:14,483
This is the best work
I ever did.

987
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:16,685
<i>I never did</i>
<i>a case like this.</i>

988
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,570
<i>But it's not enough.</i>

989
00:54:18,606 --> 00:54:21,440
<i>I gotta go back</i>
<i>to auto tomorrow morning</i>

990
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:24,893
and I just feel like
this just ain't finished.

991
00:54:24,912 --> 00:54:27,112
Detective.

991
00:54:28,305 --> 00:55:28,788

3
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:15,383
"Young man, you know

4
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,851
I'm like, "Unc,

5
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,553
Look around,

6
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:26,194
So, the old man,
he's like,
"The Poe House.

7
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:27,995
The Edward Allen
Poe House."

8
00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:30,164
Shit, you back

9
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,300
First of
the month, yo.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,269
I'm like, "I don't know

11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,306
The man look at me

I let him down.

12
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,943
I know you know you

13

14
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,413
Shorty,
I don't know you.

15
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:48,149
You know Miss Elaine
in the back room, right?

16
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:50,851
This her brother, Earl
from the VA hospital.

17
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,052
He supposed
to stay with her.

18
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:54,622
Can you help
me inside?

19
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,023

20

Thank you, young man.

24
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,292
Oh, shit.

25
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,660
Oh shit.

26
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,437
Nah, nah, nah...

00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,975
Hey, yo, Omar.

( theme music playing )

32
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:07,094
* When you walk
through the garden *

33
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:10,531
* You gotta
watch your back *

34
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,535
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

35
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,771
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

36
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:22,543
* If you walk
with Jesus *

37
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,479
* He's gonna
save your soul *

38
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,881
* You gotta
keep the devil *

39
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,388
* Way down in the hole

40
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,889
* He's got the fire
and the fury *

41
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,794
* At his command

42
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,433
* Well, you don't
have to worry *

43
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:48,769
* If you hold onto
Jesus' hand *

44
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:53,040
* We'll all be safe
from Satan *

45
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,577
* When the thunder rolls

46
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,281
* We just gotta
keep the devil *

47
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:03,717
* Way down
in the hole *

48
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,795
* Got to keep the devil

49
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,499
* Deep down in the hole

50
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,937

00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,540
* Way down in the hole.

52
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,583
You think this boy woke
up yesterday morning,

53
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:39,320
sat on the edge
of his bed and said,
"Today's my day to die"?

54
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,657
You don't think this
can happen to you?

55
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,360
Doc, hold that up.

56
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:53,667
Look at what that bullet
did to his heart.

57
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,703
That's his heart.

58
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,473
What was that,
scared straight?

59
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,409
More like
bored stiff.

60
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,411
What's the deal
with this?

61
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,779
I go down to MCI Jessup
hoping to pull up a fella

62
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,749
with some years on him,
see if he's ready
to share his feelings.

63
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,183
Turns out Barksdale,

64
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,620
D'Angelo got himself
rung up as a suicide.

65
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,622
DOD of 7-21-03.

66
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,624
Who worked it?

67
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:18,125
State police.

68
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,627
You want me to pull
the postmortem on this?

69
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,629
Yeah, he's kind of
our made guy down there.

70
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,898
I just want to make
sure that nobody did
the suicide to him.

71
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,336
Ain't nothing but dust
an' bricks over there now.

72
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:31,439
Shit, all that battlin'
we did to take them towers.

73
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,407
You're tryin' to tell me
we back on the street

74
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,842
with the rest of 'em.

75
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,111
Anyway, B, now that the towers
is gone everybody knows

76
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,447
how it gotta go down.

77
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,415
I say we send our people
over there early.

78
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,884
Corner chiefs like,
"Yo, we here now,

79
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,218
you know what I mean,

80
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,454
but we bringing
something to the table."

81
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:48,456
Lay it out like
it's their lucky day.

82
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:50,257
- Unh-hmm.
- No flexin', no threats.

83
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:51,792
Just be like,
this a good thing.

84
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,694
But you know we gonna
need good corners,

85
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,263
that's what
we're gonna need.

86
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:57,398
Close to downtown.

87
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,032
Get the workaday trade.

88
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,001
Come out
like Fremont--

89
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,269
Fayette.

90
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,904
Yeah, like 40,
$50,000 a day, easy.

91
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,140
Yeah, I'm on it.

92
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,876
You know everyone
watchin' us on this, man.

93
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,644
They wanna see if
we're gonna fuck this up

94
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:11,979
now that the towers
are down.

95
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,880
You know
what I'm sayin'?

96
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,415
They measurin' us up.

97
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,684
They wanna see if
we're gonna be weak or real.

98
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:19,387
If a fool step to us, man,
we gonna do what we gotta do.

99
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,422
But it's them bodies
that got you in here.

100
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,425
If we can do this without
the bodies, we should.

101
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,394
You know what I mean?

102
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:28,228
Especially now
we light on muscle.

103
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,431
Speakin' of muscle,
man, you heard from
that man I sent you?

104
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,732
Yeah, Cutty
from the cut.

105
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,634
He rang, we took
care of him.

106
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,102
Good, good.

107
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,837
How you fixed
for the hearing?

108
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,639
It's all good, man.

109
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,040
Shit.

110
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,243
Levy got everything
straightened up tight
for me, man.

111
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,945
I'll be home
before it get cold.

112
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:49,182
Towers came down.

113
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,451
So?

114
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,453
So, we're comin' in.

115
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,054
To my corners?

116
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,389
I don't think so.

117
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:56,657
Hold on now.

118
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,291
This is gonna be
good for you too.

119
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,460
Yeah?

120
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,128
Now, how you
figure that?

121
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:05,332
Yo, what you payin'
now, 37, 38?

122
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:08,335
Yo, we can go
31, 32 shots.

123
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:10,137
Man, this shit's
so John Blaze

124
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:14,041
you can step on it
seven, eight times
and still take the cake.

125
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,376
Man:
Spider bags!

126
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:19,046
Got those spider bags!

127
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,083
Damn!

128
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,686
Yo, y'all seen Marlo?

129
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,025
Y'all ain't
seen him?

130
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,661
Y'all know him?

131
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:36,029
Marlo?

132
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,466
Yeah, yeah,
he was here...

133
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,802
now, he ain't.

134
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:45,072
Get those spider bags.
Spider bags!

135
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,477
Jesus, Tommy,

136
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:53,246
I like to shit
when I looked up

137
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,015
and saw you on the news
givin' it to Erv.

138
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,485
( laughing )

139
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:00,788
You fucker, you're
up to something.

140
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,422
I'm up to nothing,
I'm telling you.

141
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,925
I can help him;
he can help me.

142
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,695
A little itch here;
a little scratch there.

143
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:11,298
This is a win-win
for you, ain't it?

144
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,433
He won't play?

145
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:16,136
You beat the shit outta him
because crime is up.

146
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,739
Press loves it
and you score.

147
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,675
The flip-side is that
if he caves,

148
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,112
you get yourself a snitch
in the mayor's inner-circle.

149
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,950
So, um...

150
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,319
what's my role
in your little drama?

151
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,655
I thought you might
broker a meeting.

152
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:38,458
You know, help your fearless
leader see the light

153
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,760
about his new friend
on the council.

154
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,829
And I should
tell him, what?

155
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:44,064
Make nice or invest
heavily in petroleum jelly?

156
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,436
Hey, his ass,
his choice.

157
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:51,071
( laughing )

158
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,976
You didn't
talk to him?

159
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,345
I couldn't find
the motherfucker.

160
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:01,915
Man, we just walk up,
we gonna bump.

161
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,223
There.
Middle of the block,
right there.

162
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:14,161
( rap music playing )

163
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,605
Yo, where
the whistle at?

164
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,180
Hold on.

165
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,684
Wait for Marlo.

166
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,233
Man:
Yo, Cheese.

167
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,101
Where you
been at, man?

168
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,277
Nigger, that ain't
nothin' but bait.

169
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,713
Just soap
your bitch.

170
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,719
Who my dawg?
You my dawg.

171
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,488
Who's my dawg?
Who's my baby?

172
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,659
You make Daddy
some money, alright?
Yeah.

173
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,235
25 large on dawg.

174
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,304
I'll take that bet.

175
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,505
Cheese!

176
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,741
Yeah.

177
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,927
Herc:
Anybody I want?

178
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,528
Anybody.

179
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,331
I want more
than one.

180
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,333
I want
the Olsen twins.

181
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,534
You got 'em.

182
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,069
Slaves.

183
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,005
All they live for
is to get you off.

184
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,507
But so now who
you gonna do for 'em?

185
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,210
One guy, one act,
one time.

186
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,246
Right. And the minute I name
a guy you're gonna be like,

187
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,247
"I knew you
were a cocksucker

188
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,982
from the first time
I laid eyes on you.

189
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,184
Steve McQueen, huh?

190
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,552
That's your fantasy?

191
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,255
You fuckin' closet-case
motherfucker."

192
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,556
Steve McQueen?

193
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,359
Fuck you,
it's a set-up.

194
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,228
Both Olsen twins.

195
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,262
Ashley. Kate.

196
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,166
Mary-Kate.

197
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,301
And, yeah, I admire
their body of work.

198
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,803
They're yours.

199
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,739
All you gotta
do is name a guy.

200
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,409
I'm not catching,
I'm pitching.

201
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,511
No problem.

202
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,281
( men shouting )

203
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,356
Cornermen out
of the pit...

204
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,398
release your dogs.

205
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:43,136
( men shouting )

206
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,787
I got that!
Yeah, I got that!

207
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,163
( dog whines )

208
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,705
Okay, hold it.
Break your dogs!

209
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:21,408
Look here.
Look, he killing him.

210
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,786
Man:
Aw, look at dawg.

211
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,994
Bait.

212
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,530
( gunshot )

213
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,532
Man:
Oh shit,
there it is.

214
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,768
Herc: Can't it
just be like...

215
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:24,337
like this
unbearable-looking woman?

216
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,740
You know like that old tune
from "The Golden Girls,"

217
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,477
the short one with
the Coke-bottle glasses.

218
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,579
A guy.

219
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:36,549
Hey, yo.

220
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,051
Huh?

221
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,752
Let me ask you
a question.

222
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,188
Where do you guys
get those hats

223
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,056
with the bills over
the ears like that.

224
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,225
I go into all the city stores
and the only ones I can find

225
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,261
are the ones with
the bills in the front.

226
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,362
Naw, it's the same.

227
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,265
Just turn it sideways
on your head.

228
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,567
Thanks.

229
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,169
Thank you.

230
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:03,010
That's a knucklehead from
the low-rises, right there.

231
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,345
Terrace's spreading out.

232
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,514
They got to go
somewheres, I guess.

233
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,322
Don't think you ought
needed to do that.

234
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,758
He turned cur
on me, man.

235
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,560
Nah.

236
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,329
I think
you got played.

237
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,910
* When I move, you move
just like that *

238
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,179
* When I move,
you move just like that *

239
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,614
* Hell, yeah, that DJ
bring that back *

240
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,785
* When I move, you move
just like that *

241
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,287
* When I move,
you move... *

242
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:51,624
So, I'm guessin' from
the Terrace being all cute

243
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,860
about the property line.

244
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,295
I just wanted
to wait and see

245
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,997
what you wanted us
to do about it.

246
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:01,468
So, what you
want us to do?

247
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,502
Get back to work.

248
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,940
Alright.

249
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,743
* Our time and our clothes
gotta coordinate *

250
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,513
* That's why they're spilling
drinks all over your dress *

251
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,117
* Got Louis Vuitton bras...

252
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,924
Burrell:
Your boy really jammed me,
that little prick.

253
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,094
It was all
over the news.

254
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:30,563
You did not look particularly
commissioner-like.

255
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,532
Mayor told me
the same thing.

256
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,303
You can't have
that shit every week,

257
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:40,807
not if you want His Honor
to give you the job permanent.

258
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:43,310
Tommy's a good kid,
usually.

259
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,778
An asspain when
he wants something,

260
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,314
but mostly
good people.

261
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,382
I don't give
a shit what he is.

262
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,385
Well, you can't have him
pounding on you, Erv.

263
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,621
Throw him a bone...

264
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,591
he'll take
care of you.

265
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,895
Alright, but
I draw the line

266
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,798
at going behind
the mayor for this guy.

267
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,335
You can't sit
where I'm sitting

268
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:11,071
and backdoor
the fucking mayor.

269
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,972
Sorry I'm late, guys.

270
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,975
My kid had
a little league game.
It started late.

271
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,945
Well, I'll leave
you boys to it.

272
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:20,513
And what I have
brought together,

273
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:24,184
let no man
tear asunder.

274
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,555
- He win?
- Who?

275
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,523
Your kid, his team.

276
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,592
Oh shit,
who keeps score?

277
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,965
Yeah, it's a little hectic,
but everybody steppin' off

278
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,167
at the right time.

279
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:41,634
These corner boys
we dealin' with?

280
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,371
I don't think they even
listen to their own people.

281
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,573
Yeah, I'm gonna
talk to peoples.

282
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,241
Where you at?

283
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:52,011
Marlo?
I can't find him.

284
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,247
And you told us
not to start nothin',

285
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,915
so I set-up in the middle
of the block.

286
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,617
You know, even
that got hard stares.

287
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,621
I don't know.
It ain't gonna hold,
I don't think.

288
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,291
This Marlo.

289
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,792
How hard you
lookin' for him?

290
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,129
Like, why ain't
you out there

291
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,897
looking for this
motherfucker right now?

292
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,599
'Cause you called
this meeting here.

293
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,609
Shut the door.

294
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,380
What's your
good news, man.

295
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,382
Omar right
inside the stash.

296
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:33,220
Couple ounces of raw
already vialed, 600.

297
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,654
Cocksuckers even
took my watch.

298
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,891
Second stash this month
they did got to.

299
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,760
I mean, he, um,

300
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,829
he called you
by name, String.

301
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,665
I mean, all due respect,
but do like unless you
step to him,

302
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,102
it's gonna
be like this.

303
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,174
Alright, man.

304
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:57,310
Double the muscle
on every stash we got.

305
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,045
And if the man comin',

306
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:01,548
make ready
for the man.

307
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,049
It's not personal.

308
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,453
I swear to God,
it is never personal with me.

309
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,358
Truth is,

310
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,161
I've been a councilman
for almost three years now.

311
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:17,364
And that's a long
fucking time to be ignored.

312
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,966
And this being Baltimore,
a white boy doesn't stand

313
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,368
much chance
running citywide.

314
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,736
Maybe the legislature,
if the right seat opens up.

315
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,139
But until then, I'm stuck
in a job with no power

316
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,275
except getting
potholes filled.

317
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,709
All due respect,
Councilman,

318
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:35,548
you're fucking with me
because, what, you're bored?

319
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,217
A little, yeah.

320
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,352
And what the fuck?

321
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,787
I mean, when it comes
to the crime thing,

322
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,089
this city can use all
the fucking help it can get.

323
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,892
If you're looking for dirt,
there isn't any.

324
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:46,826
There's always
fucking dirt.

325
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,395
But right now,

326
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:51,097
I'm just looking to know
how we could do better.

327
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,399
You give me
that much.

328
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:55,335
I can try and get you
what you need privately.

329
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,870
No hearings, no press,
no grandstanding.

330
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,306
And if I don't
play ball?

331
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,073
You're gonna
have my ass

332
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,376
every time I'm in front
of your committee, right?

333
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,882
One thing
comes to mind.

334
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,384
Shoot.

335
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,753
I can't get my marked units
back from Dickman Street

336
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,122
to save my life.

337
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,390
Cars that are
shopped for service

338
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,192
don't come back
for weeks.

339
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,627
You tell the mayor?

340
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:23,763
Not that you
heard it from me.

341
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,467
Of course not.

342
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,570
How much these?

343
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,273
10,000 a set.

344
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,775
Nigger show that on a ride,
he hangin' a sign on himself.

345
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,611
Lock my ass up.

346
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,413
No, shit.

347
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,982
So how you
gonna play it?

348
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,485
If they from
the Terrace,

349
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,053
that's Avon.

350
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:48,855
I know.

351
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:50,723
And Avon,
he comin' home, too.

352
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,663
Well, if you inclined
to work something out,
that's one thing.

353
00:19:56,763 --> 00:20:00,567
If not, Avon can
seriously handle up.

354
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,168
I know.

355
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,304
So if you want to hold
onto what's yours,

356
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,972
you best be ready.

357
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,311
You remember that
Barksdale kid?

358
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,645
The one who took
all the weight?

359
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,281
Mmm.

360
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,182
Tied his neck to a doorknob
in the prison library

361
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:18,651
and sat his ass down.

362
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,219
I dunno.

363
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,956
Men of color usually
don't do themselves.

364
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,994
I mean, take me,
for instance...

365
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:30,096
Yeah, I mean.
You got all the reason
in the world...

366
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:31,364
And yet here I am,

367
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,666
still standing.

368
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,535
Give or take.

369
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,474
You looked
at the scene photos?

370
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,376
Nah, there
ain't none.

371
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,945
State police
dogged it.

372
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:54,220
My turn, Bunk.

373
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:57,223
Come on, come on.

374
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:58,725
Go with
number three.

375
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,867
You gonna play
my song, darling?

376
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:10,437
Huh?

377
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:13,172
- You play
the right song--
- Hey, Bunk.

378
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,941
--I can make you hit
the high notes, baby.

379
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,243
- Hey, Bunk.
- Hey, look, I saw
her first, Jimmy.

380
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:18,778
Bunk, man,
what are you doing?

381
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:19,979
I got a place
right here in Camden.

382
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,280
Be a gentleman,
come on.

383
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,682
I'm bein'
a gentleman, man.

384
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,451
I'm really not
interested, okay?

385
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:27,086
- Come on, let's go.
- You're all pink, baby.

386
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:30,390
I'm really sorry,
he's had a bit too much
to drink, you know?

387
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,891
It's okay.
Thank you, thanks.

388
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,129
- You alright?
- Yeah.

389
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,065
You get
yourself home?

390
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah.

391
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,503
Knock it out.

392
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,810
- Naw, the baddest
nigger of all time?
- Who?

393
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,346
This nigger from New York
from the olden days,

394
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:54,881
- Bumpy something--
- Bumpy?

395
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,885
Yo, he do shit like, run up
to a police station by hisself.

396
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,487
- Nah.
- You know what I'm sayin'?
Shit like that.

397
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:02,121
Cops be like
hidin', like,

398
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,223
"Yo, Bumpy, we sorry,
man, we sorry.

399
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,659
Please go away,
please, please!"

400
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,562
Woof.

401
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,665
( dog barking )

402
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,875
And obtain
gainful employment

403
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,711
and refrain from associating
with known criminals,

404
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:26,446
and keep this office
informed of your residence

405
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,214
and any change
in that residence.

406
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,817
So I gather you're
not working at this
particular time.

407
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:33,720
They still doin' morning
shape-ups down at the market?

408
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,655
I don't know
and I don't care.

409
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:38,425
Just get a job,
any job.

410
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:42,194
- "Woof"?
- "Woof," like a dog.

411
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,464
Oh, shit,
it was like blaow!

412
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:46,699
It was
Cheese's boy, Tri.

413
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,706
So you gonna
hit back or what?

414
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,744
You got a better
shot of the ligature?

415
00:22:58,445 --> 00:22:59,979
Yeah, inside.

416
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,755
What he do,
hang himself twice?

417
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:10,222
He could have been
leaning straight forward

418
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,658
until he blacked out
then slid down

419
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,059
which would give you
the vertical.

420
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:16,262
Or how about I come up
at him from behind...

421
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:20,132
and then set him down, make it
look like goodbye cruel world.

422
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,268
What do the scene
shots show?

423
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,770
None taken.

424
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,238
The troopers really fucked
the pooch on this one.

425
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,074
All I have is
some half-assed report

426
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:30,910
reads like the investigator
went off his Ritalin.

427
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,245
What's a large eckee...

428
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,982
No, large ecchymotic
area, or mid-back.

429
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,384
Bruising.

430
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:41,688
What, mid-back
as in...?

431
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,723
Or he banged himself a few
days earlier in the shower,

432
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,692
but, yeah, maybe.

433
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,394
Nothing like
a definite maybe.

434
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:50,497
Man:
Tri finally
got that M, hmm?

435
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:51,931
Done it on foot
too, hmm.

436
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,033
Caroline?

437
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,903
Nigger lyin' in chalk,
but my boy Tri

438
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,571
got the dapple all
up his sleeve.

439
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,707
Looks like
polka dots.

440
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,274
But that's just something
you got to know from
experience,

441
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,342
you know
what I'm sayin'?

442
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,811
Woman:
Mmm-hmm.

443
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,746
I even had to school him
on the whistle,

444
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,447
still walkin'
around with it.

445
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:11,117
"Yo, Tri, stash that
shit up at Neesey's.

446
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:12,719
What's wrong
with you?"

447
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,688
Aw, you know them niggers
is gonna get mad busy

448
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,290
over this,
so we gettin' busy too.

449
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,926
Woman:
so what time
you comin' over?

450
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:23,462
Damn, bitch, ain't you
even listenin'?

451
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:26,599
A, A,
you still there?

452
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,009
Time-out!

453
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,486
- Do that again.
- Do what again?

454
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:49,488
Do that thing
with your hand.
Do it in my face.

455
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,423
Fuck you
talkin' about?

456
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:53,092
Ooh!
Ooh, man!

457
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,462
He didn't do nothing.

458
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:58,230
Got a lot of
room in here.

459
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,377
Fuck the police!

460
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:14,180
Naw, man, we was
just hangin'.

461
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,682
Just slingin'.

462
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:18,284
How'd you work it out
with the corner crews,

463
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,486
all you guys
from the Terrace
coming in like this?

464
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:21,821
I don't know
what you talkin' about.

465
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:23,322
Well, you best
watch your ass.

466
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,791
'cause the slingers
out here?

467
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:26,859
They're like
the crack babies' babies.

468
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,995
Man, every year
everybody's like,

469
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:31,898
"Yeah, these kids out here,
they're a new breed.

470
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:34,233
I ain't never seen
nothing like this before.

471
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,602
This the end
of the world now."

472
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:36,869
Look around you,
fuckhead.

473
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,504
This seem like the dawn
of a new day to you?

474
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:40,907
Can I go now?

475
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:43,309
Or you want to slap me
up some more first?

476
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:50,750
Get the fuck
out of here.

477
00:25:58,357 --> 00:25:59,892
How about
a handjob?

478
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,794
Huh?

479
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:05,464
Aw, man, you don't even get
Weezy Jefferson for a handjob.

480
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,466
- Come on.
- Dozerman.

481
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,101
Wanna call it
a day?

482
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,877
Man :
They came back
on us this time.

483
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:20,412
Dazz an' them.
They got Peanut.

484
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,114
Woman:
Oh, shit,
is Peanut dead?

485
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,750
Naw, he's okay.

486
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,585
His brains all over
the sidewalk, but he's okay.

487
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,287
What the hell
do you think?

488
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:31,190
Ah, shit,
I gotta call Tony.
I'll get back at you.

489
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,491
Alright.

490
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,493
Well, that's two
we heard about.

491
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,495
What the hell's
going on?

492
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,496
Drug war maybe?

493
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,331
Man:
S'up?

494
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,433
Cheese:
Nothing good, man.

495
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:44,136
I ain't sleep
since I capped his ass.

496
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:48,507
Close my eyes, see him layin'
there all bloody and shit.

497
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,209
Cheese, man, you did
what you had to do.

498
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:54,513
What I thought
I had to do.

499
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,514
That's Cheese?

500
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,383
He was my dog, yo.

501
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,185
Had much love
for me, even then.

502
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:03,455
I ain't never gonna find
another dog like that.

503
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,192
Well, they payin'
for it now.

504
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,695
Mos' def.

505
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,765
For months, these assholes
show perfect phone discipline.

506
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,901
Now, they're
talking up murders?

507
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,469
Cheese is only a level
below Proposition Joe.

508
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,039
All of a sudden,
this case has legs.

509
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:20,940
Man:
Homicide.

510
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,474
This is Freamon,
major-case.

511
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,410
Who's the OIC
tonight?

512
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,478
Hold on for Norris.

513
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,280
Man:
Yo, T. T, man.

514
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,249
- Man 2: What's up?
- I'm shot, I'm shot.

515
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:35,354
Aw, shit, shit,
they comin' back.

516
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:38,157
( screams )
Motherfucker!

517
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,026
( screaming )

518
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,299
- Who this?
- Damn.

519
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,902
- Detective Norris.
- Ed, this is Lester.

520
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,738
I hear you're catchin'
bodies on the East Side.

521
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:54,306
You "hear" it?
Like what, "probable
cause," hear it?

522
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,175
Like, "I got something
concrete," hear it?

523
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,777
Or just, "gas up
my head," hear it?

524
00:27:57,877 --> 00:27:59,245
Like, "I got all
the fucking time

525
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:00,780
in the world to jaw
with you," hear it?

526
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,481
How many bodies
you got, Eddie?

527
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:06,152
"How many you got,
Eddie?" Asshole.

528
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,022
You want me
to go up to homicide?

529
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,791
No, I got it.
I got it.

530
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:13,492
You're the early man
on tomorrow, so go home.

531
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:15,795
See your kid.

532
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:18,497
I'm telling you, this kid
Berman's a fucking wizard.

533
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:20,099
I mean check
it out, right?

534
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,301
Six reported auto thefts,
two of which state,

535
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,972
"Not impossible
car was borrowed"

536
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:28,808
making four auto thefts,
with two unfounded.

537
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:30,309
And the prizewinner?

538
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,745
Four armed robberies,
two of which complainants state,

539
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,113
"Too dark to ID weapon,

540
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:37,349
not impossible knife
wasn't a comb."

541
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:38,517
He mighta
groomed 'em to death.

542
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:41,353
- Yeah.
- Wine into water.

543
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,423
There he is.
Abbadabba Berman.

544
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,425
The Dr. Atkins
of crime.

545
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,995
Just doing
what I'm told.

546
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,533
God, what
a beautiful film.

547
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,102
I couldn't
understand a word.

548
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:58,037
Oh, honey, you gotta
read the subtitles.

549
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:00,940
Oh, shit.

550
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,075
Y'all go
to the movies?

551
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:07,847
And you must be
the lovely Mrs. Herc.

552
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:10,049
How'd you like
your movie?

553
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,884
Okay.

554
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,152
Herc and Carver here,

555
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,988
they try to snatch us up
everyday like...

556
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,057
"Where the shit?
Who got the shit?"

557
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,459
But they never
get nothing.

558
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,362
So y'all go
to the movies.

559
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:26,498
Damn.

560
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,200
Alright then.

561
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,936
See ya tomorrow.

562
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,340
Is everything okay?

563
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,851
On two.

564
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,954
Pick up!
Pick up!

565
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:50,556
- Ed, you gotta help me.
- I can't, now now.

566
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,111
( TV chatter )

567
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,582
( baby cooing )

568
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,123
So.

569
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:25,992
So?

570
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,162
Everything good?

571
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,268
How's that
fontanette?

572
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,571
Fontanelle.

573
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:45,477
Is it closing up?

574
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,480
Won't close
for a while.

575
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,550
Good.

576
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,086
Good?

577
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,593
I'm just--
I'm just sayin'.

578
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:19,478
Seis hombres,
seis dolares.

579
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,213
Seis hombres.

580
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:40,432
I ain't sleep
since I capped his ass.

581
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,401
Close my eyes

582
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:45,137
and see him layin'
there all bloody and shit?

583
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,073
Cheese.

584
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:49,608
Cheese on a platter.

585
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,477
He never talks
like that.

586
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,312
Now, why would--

587
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,482
Because all good things
come to those who wait.

588
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,484
Does McNulty know?

589
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,186
I'll raise his ass.

590
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:01,753
We'll keep our
ears to the wire,

591
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,190
keep gathering string,
no problem.

592
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,858
But if bodies keep falling
in the Eastern District,

593
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,295
we might have to give up
this wire tap.

594
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,500
Now you comin' around?

595
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,534
Been more
than a damn year.

596
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:20,072
Looks just
like his dad, huh?

597
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:25,411
( phone ringing )

598
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,383
Let me ask you.

599
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:35,221
When you heard Dee was
a suicide, what'd you think?

600
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,392
Hey, little fellow.

601
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,228
Come here.

602
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,270
Here's the thing:
we got a tip.

603
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,971
And the autopsy report,
it backs us up.

604
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:54,940
Can you put him
down please?

605
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,509
Sure.

606
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,885
You know, I'm sorry
about your loss.

607
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,588
He seemed like
a pretty decent guy,
all things considered.

608
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:15,227
So when I found out
about this,

609
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,364
I felt like I owed him.

610
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:22,834
The last thing I wanted
to do was upset you

611
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,205
if there was
no point to it, so...

612
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,180
If there's anything
I can help with

613
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,448
or any questions
you need answered...

614
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:37,616
or whatever.

615
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:51,597
Major, how many people
are under your command?

616
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,865
278, sir.

617
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,401
278.

618
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,636
And how many felony arrests
they make last month?

619
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:01,573
Don't bother.

620
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:03,309
You made 16.

621
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,577
16.

622
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:07,579
In a month.

623
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,381
Same time period.

624
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:10,916
How many handguns
you pick up?

625
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:12,918
All shifts,
all sectors.

626
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:16,155
Once again,
don't bother.

627
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:17,989
The answer is none.

628
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,591
None.

629
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:23,329
You had four bodies last
night in how many hours?

630
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,897
Shut the fucking book,
how many hours?

631
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,266
Seven.

632
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,103
Try five.

633
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:34,806
Tell me about
this kid.

634
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,611
I believe his name
is James...

635
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,012
James Toney.

636
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,781
When's the last time
he was arrested?

637
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:45,050
With who?

638
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:46,418
Where's he sling?

639
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:49,288
How about
this guy?

640
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,458
Or him?

641
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:53,725
Or him?

642
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,427
You know what?

643
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:58,330
You got four bodies, all within
two blocks of each other

644
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,200
and you can't even start
to connect the fucking dots.

645
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,369
You got eight hours
to get a grip

646
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,537
on this mess
or you're done.
You hear me?

647
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,173
Done.

648
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,874
Marlo?

649
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:50,882
You know I'm with
Avon, right?

650
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,353
Stringer Bell?

651
00:35:56,222 --> 00:35:58,657
Can we talk?

652
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,862
I need you to walk back up
there and pack up your people.

653
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,638
I'm being a gentleman
about it for the moment.

654
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:24,650
You offer up what
you have on this,

655
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,418
you start the clock
running on yourselves.

656
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,620
The wiretap has
to surface in court.

657
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,988
No way around it.

658
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:31,423
She's right.

659
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,058
We finally got something
worth listening to

660
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,125
and you're talking
about giving up the wire?

661
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:35,894
Makes no sense.

662
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:37,396
There's a war
going on.

663
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:39,731
We might have four
more bodies tonight.

664
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:42,468
This is Baltimore,
we might have six.

665
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,370
I watched Marvin Taylor
from the Eastern

666
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,972
get his asshole ripped today
because he has no fucking clue.

667
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,407
I don't believe this.

668
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:50,942
We got top lieutenants
talking about murders,

669
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,245
and we can't figure out just
to shut up and take notes?

670
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:54,446
We got bodies
on the ground, Jimmy.

671
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,348
That's gotta matter
for something.

672
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,850
No, if we're at Cheese
then we're close to Prop Joe,

673
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,819
and if we're close to Joe,
then we're close to Stringer.

674
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,388
That has to matter.

675
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:05,156
Look, I was right there
with you when we left Stringer

676
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:06,592
on the street
and it grinds me, too.

677
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:09,828
But the fact is,
we didn't create this unit

678
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,331
just to lock up
dope dealers.

679
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:14,400
There's a narcotics unit
downtown for that.

680
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,335
We're about
violence.

681
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:17,403
Have been
from the jump.

682
00:37:17,503 --> 00:37:19,405
Barksdale
was violent.

683
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:21,407
But right now,
Stringer's quiet,

684
00:37:21,507 --> 00:37:23,342
and over on the Eastside,
we got bodies.

685
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,243
Jimmy, we got enough
from the tap

686
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:26,845
to take a real
good shot at Cheese.

687
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:29,348
You put a murder
case or two together,

688
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:30,416
you may be able
to roll someone up

689
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:32,651
at Proposition Joe
or Stringer.

690
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,454
As far as bodies go,
four's a big number.

691
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:40,726
Okay, then.

692
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:44,330
As of now, we use the phones
to work these murders.

693
00:37:55,474 --> 00:38:00,145
Yo quiero mucho menos
pastillas de secoya en eso.

694
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:03,849
Y muy mas
ancho un poco.

695
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,318
Si? Gracias.

696
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,695
- Yo, we bracin' up, son.
- Huh?

697
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,097
Gather yourself, nigga.
We gotta bead on Dazz.

698
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:20,298
Be at Neesey's crib
in a hour.

699
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,733
Dazz be
with Neesey?

700
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,168
I thought
she was your girl.

701
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:26,405
Caroline:
Neesey, huh?
Got it.

702
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:30,008
Bring your whistle,
in a hour, one.

703
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:31,643
Mount up.

704
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:38,417
Caroline, call QRT with
that 20 and stay on the wire.

705
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:41,052
- We're on channel two.
- Alright.

706
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,632
Yo, Tri, what size
fries you want?

707
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:54,900
What?

708
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,035
- Go!
- Police!

709
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:59,070
- Search warrant!
- Freeze!

710
00:39:00,406 --> 00:39:02,941
Hands up!
Down on the ground!

711
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:08,279
Put your hands up!
Put your hands up!

712
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,449
Hands on
your head!

713
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,253
Okay, Mary Tyler Moore.
Buck-naked.

714
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,188
Open the door,
here I come,

715
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,224
drop my attaché
case down,

716
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:22,428
bend her over, give it
to her on the ottoman,
and she's like,

717
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:25,330
"Oh, Rob! Oh, Rob!"

718
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:26,832
Who's Rob?

719
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:28,567
From the show.

720
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:29,668
Done.

721
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:32,237
Mary-Kate and Ashley,
I don't want to say.

722
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,440
Just accept whatever pictures
are on my mind right now.

723
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,374
Anybody else?

724
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:39,210
Yeah, Dozerman's girl,
what's her name?

725
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,747
She's baking a cake.
Naked.

726
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:43,982
White flour splotches all
over her fine brown skin.

727
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:48,454
I come in in a chef's hat,
nothing else on,

728
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:50,456
Johnson out
to here and say,

729
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:51,990
"That's no way
to stir a batter.

730
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,960
Here, let me
try to get--"

731
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,929
Hey, Doze,
what's up?

732
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,031
Done, now the guy.

733
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,301
This is a hard one for
anybody to understand.

734
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,003
I mean it's got
nothing to do with sex.

735
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,073
It's about...

736
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,407
sympathy.

737
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,076
It's about giving
a guy a break.

738
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:13,712
Yeah, okay, okay.

739
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,849
Gus Triandos.

740
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,918
Who's Gus Triandos?

741
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:22,387
He was a catcher with
the Orioles back in the day.

742
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:24,255
My brother
had his card,

743
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,257
sorry lookin'
motherfucker.

744
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,359
I mean, he looked
like this little kid

745
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,396
who got left at a bus
station by his parents.

746
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:34,500
You know why?

747
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,668
Because he had to catch
Hoyt Wilhelm's knuckleball.

748
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:40,038
Five fucking years,
the worst gig in baseball.

749
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:42,307
It was like trying to catch
a greased pig with wings.

750
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:45,043
He even told a reporter once
"Wilhelm nearly ruined me."

751
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:48,514
Gus Triandos.

752
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:50,281
Big slow guy.

753
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,117
Good choice.

754
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:53,351
Go ahead, say it.

755
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,820
I know you want
to say it.

756
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,655
Say what?
There's nothing to say.

757
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:57,523
Nothing?

758
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,024
You put a lot of
thought into it.

759
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,258
It's cool.

760
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:01,993
Okay.

761
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,895
Okay.

762
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:05,497
Tonight, three things.

763
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:06,832
Number one.

764
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,934
Keep your incident
numbers sequential

765
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:10,301
or it's gonna be
a stone mess tomorrow.

766
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,803
Number two.

767
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:14,272
We'll be photographing
evidence at the scene.

768
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:17,075
That means don't bag anything
until you get the shot off.

769
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,781
And number three,
don't embarrass yourselves.

770
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:26,251
Make sure your camera's
loaded with film.

771
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,988
Okay, mount up.

772
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:34,459
So Cheese,
who's your dawg?

773
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,195
You my dawg.

774
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,797
( chuckles )

775
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:41,432
I just wanna know
who's your dawg, dawg.

776
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:43,735
What's this,
some psychology, huh?

777
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:47,739
Yeah, okay, uh,
"Yo, please stop, stop.

778
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,941
I'll tell you
everything I know."

779
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:53,511
C'mon, Cheese.

780
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,747
Who's your dawg?

781
00:41:58,283 --> 00:41:59,751
Oh, hell, no.

782
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,220
Y'all ain't layin'
no bodies on me, man.

783
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,655
Lawyer time.

784
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,891
"He was my dawg, man.

785
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:09,494
I ain't sleep since
I capped his ass.

786
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:11,129
Lookin' up at me
all bloody and shit?

787
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:17,903
Had much love
for me even then.

788
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:20,739
I ain't never gonna
find another."

789
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:28,013
Man, y'all some cold-ass
motherfuckers, man.

790
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,683
We got you on tape.

791
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:38,323
So what happened,
Cheese?

792
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,927
I thought he punked me,
alright?

793
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:43,528
So I did what
I had to do.

794
00:42:43,629 --> 00:42:46,965
Which was?

795
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,767
Lit him up.

796
00:42:51,637 --> 00:42:54,072
Well, he's
talking anyway.

797
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:01,412
Well, what's
done is done.

798
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,148
But, maybe we can
help you on this.

799
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:04,950
How?

800
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,484
You gonna
bring him back?

801
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,486
No, on the consequences.

802
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,488
Help us help you.

803
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,124
- What?
- Maybe we can trade up.

804
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:15,293
Trade up for
what, man?

805
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:16,695
For this?
The fuck...

806
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:18,296
Proposition Joe.

807
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:21,332
You give us Prop Joe and maybe
we look at this whole thing

808
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,968
with dawg differently.

809
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:25,203
Now, why would I be talkin'
about Prop Joe behind--

810
00:43:26,171 --> 00:43:27,706
you know what, man?

811
00:43:27,806 --> 00:43:29,507
I don't even
know no Prop Joe.

812
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,878
Okay, dawg...

813
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:34,112
which one of
these is he?

814
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,314
Where's that body?

815
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:37,816
Where I left it
most likely.

816
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:39,217
Warehouse
on the East Side.

817
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:41,319
And he still there?

818
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:42,788
Far as I know.

819
00:43:42,888 --> 00:43:45,123
Unless the SPCA
come around.

820
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:49,360
What?

821
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,496
Looks like
they broke him.

822
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:53,531
I got to say.

823
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,234
You really showed me
something on this.

824
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:01,807
What can I possibly
add to that

825
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:04,409
except I owe you
one, Cedric.

826
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,484
You ever have
one of those

827
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,021
have-your-cake-
and-eat-it-too days?

828
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:18,924
I believe this
could be my first.

829
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,329
Tell me something good.

830
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:26,431
We're charging him.

831
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:28,033
Improper disposal
of an animal.

832
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:30,168
Discharging a firearm
in city limits.

833
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:33,739
Animal cruelty, if you
wanna run wild with it.

834
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,246
Go ahead.
Call me a cocksucker.

835
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,680
You know you wanna.

836
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:44,249
Excuse me?

837
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:47,518
You know, I actually looked
up the stats on Gus Triandos.

838
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,520
Power hitter, right?

839
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,490
( laughs )

840
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,992
Fuck the both of you.

841
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:09,307
Later, dawg.

842
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:12,043
Kiss my ass.

843
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:16,081
- Night, Bunk.
- Night.

844
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:21,319
Funny day.

845
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:24,222
I'm the new departmental pet
for shutting down a drug war,

846
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:27,325
but I blew my wire
for a dead terrier.

847
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:35,733
You remember how you said

848
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:37,302
you hoped today
would be your first

849
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:41,339
have-your-cake-
and-eat-it-too day?

850
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,209
What about it?

851
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:58,089
( honks )

852
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:04,229
( laughing )

853
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,302
Okay, gents.

854
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:13,104
You see the brake
lights pump twice,

855
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:15,540
you know we got
a clean hand-to-hand.

856
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:24,749
So I get in this
morning and I'm looking
at three phone messages

857
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:26,684
from Buddy Ferraro
over at DPW

858
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:31,756
all assuring me
that I'll have 20 radio
cars back in service

859
00:46:31,857 --> 00:46:33,158
at the end
of the week.

860
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:35,293
Buddy and my old man
go way back.

861
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:38,563
Made their first communion
together at St. Leo's.

862
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,035
So...

863
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,004
what else
do you need?

864
00:46:46,104 --> 00:46:49,374
You didn't go
to the mayor with it?

865
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,009
Did you get
your cars?

866
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:53,344
Did anyone get
fucked over it?

867
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:56,581
Or did your job just
get a little easier?

868
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:03,855
I got 70 cops retiring
at the end of the year

869
00:47:03,955 --> 00:47:05,190
that I know of

870
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,525
and no money for
an academy class.

871
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,027
The mayor fucked you

872
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:11,062
'cause I know that money
was in the budget.

873
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,331
The mayor delayed it
till next summer.

874
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:15,433
Less troops, less salary,
less Bennies.

875
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:18,904
Even a six-month delay

876
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:20,438
saves the city
two, three million.

877
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:24,009
Let me talk
to some people.

878
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,163
( baby cooing )

879
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:22,200
( gunshot )

880
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,373
( phone ringing )

881
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,112
Yeah.

882
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:36,347
- Major Colvin?
- Yeah.

883
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:40,285
This is the com center.
I'm sorry to call you, sir,

884
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:44,555
but we have an officer
down in your district.

885
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,258
Which hospital?

886
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,133
I, uh,

887
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:56,601
just got
the lease, so...

888
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:09,847
Fucking solo cars!

889
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,882
I shoulda teamed him.
I fucked up.

890
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:14,219
Dead-ass
motherfucker's dead.

891
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,388
We catch up to him,
he don't come in alive.

892
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:20,058
Right?

893
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:31,569
Nicked jugular,
shattered jaw.

894
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,174
He'll live.

895
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,584
Give me one of those.

896
00:49:50,455 --> 00:49:54,359
I just got back
from shock-trauma.

897
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:57,362
You guys saved his ass getting
him down as fast as you did.

898
00:49:59,264 --> 00:50:01,832
So who we got
for a suspect?

899
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,568
Number one male,
white t-shirt,

900
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,603
baggy jeans,
tennis shoes.

901
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:08,373
In the wind, but we're
locking it down out there.

902
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:12,077
So what's this
I hear about the gun?

903
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,381
Doze tried to return fire,
he dropped his piece.

904
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:19,150
Some fuck picks it
up and books.

905
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,619
I mean I can't
believe this shit.

906
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,523
I'll take it.

907
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:35,166
No, no, no...

908
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:41,272
( music playing )

909
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:06,063
( sirens wailing )

910
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:10,768
It'll be nicer when
I fix the place up.

911
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:13,104
Cedric...

912
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:15,273
I don't care.

913
00:51:25,983 --> 00:51:27,252
No, tell him
I'm cooked.

914
00:51:27,352 --> 00:51:29,220
I just got done at
the hospital, I'm all in.

915
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,756
Well, he was asking
if you could maybe talk
to the reporters.

916
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:33,958
No, he doesn't want me talking
to reporters right now.

917
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:36,161
- Alright.
- That would truly be unwise.

918
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:37,628
Alright, alright,
I'll tell him.

919
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:39,530
Alright.

920
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:42,933
Bunny.

921
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,969
You look hellacious.

922
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:47,672
You got any coffee
going in there?

923
00:51:49,474 --> 00:51:50,708
You know what
I was thinking?

924
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,479
Tonight's
a good night.

925
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,214
Why?

926
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:58,683
Because my shot cop
didn't die.

927
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:03,154
Then it hit me...

928
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:06,824
this is what makes
a good night on my watch:

929
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:09,827
absence of
a negative.

930
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:12,263
That was
a good night.

931
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:15,366
Here's the thing.

932
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,835
Six months
from now?

933
00:52:17,935 --> 00:52:19,937
I'm gone.

934
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:23,274
I put in my 30
and the only thing

935
00:52:23,374 --> 00:52:25,410
that'll be left of me
on that job is an

936
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:29,247
eight-by-eleven
framed picture in
the Western hallway.

937
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:31,882
But you know what?

938
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,552
The shit out there,

939
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,621
the city,

940
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:39,056
it's worse than when
I first came on.

941
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:42,393
So what does that
say about me?

942
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:46,997
About my life?

943
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:49,400
Aw, c'mon, man.
You're talking about drugs.

944
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,969
That's a force
of nature.

945
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:54,004
That's sweeping leaves
on a windy day

946
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,406
whoever the hell
you are.

947
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,642
You fought
the good fight.

948
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,392
Not a call since
we gave it up to Cheese.

949
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:16,627
What did you expect?

950
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:20,865
Attention.

951
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:32,443
Be seated.

952
00:53:40,251 --> 00:53:43,454
Regarding
Officer Dozerman,

953
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:47,658
his condition
has been upgraded
to guarded.

954
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:49,460
'Till he can
receive visits,

955
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,397
he's been moved
to the recovery unit.

956
00:53:54,098 --> 00:53:55,666
As of this tour,

957
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:57,835
all hand-to-hand
undercover buys of CDS

958
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:01,839
Are suspended
in the Western District.

959
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:05,242
( murmuring )

960
00:54:07,044 --> 00:54:09,079
Somewhere

961
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,149
back in the dawn
of time,

962
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:15,953
this district had
itself a civic dilemma

963
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:19,089
of epic proportions.

964
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,426
The city council
had just passed a law

965
00:54:21,526 --> 00:54:23,861
that forbid alcoholic
consumption in public places.

966
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:26,864
On the streets
and on the corners.

967
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,102
But the corner is,

968
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:34,439
and it was
and it always will be

969
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:36,874
the poor man's lounge.

970
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:39,777
It's where a man wants to be
on a hot summer's night.

971
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:42,980
It's cheaper than a bar,
catch a nice breeze,

972
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,915
watch the girls go by.

973
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:48,453
But the law's the law

974
00:54:48,553 --> 00:54:49,887
and the Western cops
rollin' by,

975
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,057
what were
they gonna do?

976
00:54:53,157 --> 00:54:55,726
If they arrested
every dude out there

977
00:54:55,826 --> 00:54:58,062
for tipping back a High Life,
there'd be no other time

978
00:54:58,162 --> 00:54:59,964
for any other kind
of police work.

979
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:01,899
And if they looked
the other way,

980
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:06,904
they'd open themselves
to all kinds of flaunting...

981
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:10,007
all kinds of disrespect.

982
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:15,413
Now, this is before
my time when it happened,

983
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:19,850
but somewheres back
in the '50s or '60s,

984
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,919
there was a small moment
of goddamn genius

985
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:26,424
by some
nameless smokehound

986
00:55:26,524 --> 00:55:28,058
who comes out
the Cut-Rate one day

987
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,960
and on his way
to the corner,

988
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:33,431
he slips that just-bought
pint of Elderberry

989
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:36,667
into a paper bag.

990
00:55:38,202 --> 00:55:42,172
A great moment
of civic compromise.

991
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:45,443
That small
wrinkled-ass paper bag

992
00:55:45,543 --> 00:55:49,013
allowed the corner boys
to have their drink in peace

993
00:55:49,113 --> 00:55:52,049
and gave us permission

994
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:56,421
to go and do police work.

995
00:55:57,555 --> 00:55:59,457
The kind of police work

996
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:03,093
that's actually
worth the effort,

997
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,430
that's worth actually

998
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,665
taking a bullet for.

999
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,836
Dozerman,

1000
00:56:11,936 --> 00:56:14,639
he got shot last night
trying to buy...

1001
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,173
three vials.

1002
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:18,075
Three!

1003
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:29,987
There's never been
a paper bag

1004
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:32,089
for drugs.

1005
00:56:39,263 --> 00:56:41,699
Until now.

1006
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:51,909
If we ain't
doing hand-to-hands,
then what the fuck?

1007
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:54,979
And that shit
with the bag?

1008
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,081
What the fuck
is that?

1009
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:22,072
( theme music playing )

1009
00:57:23,305 --> 00:58:23,774

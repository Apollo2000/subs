1
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:15,846
- Yo, J, what up, son? Where you been?
- l ain't been nowhere, T.

2
00:00:17,053 --> 00:00:21,444
You gonna see Darnell's little brother
come on out with that laundry basket.

3
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:25,486
- And the take's in the basket?
- Once in the afternoon and one at night.

4
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:27,922
Always the same laundry basket.

5
00:00:28,973 --> 00:00:33,683
- How you know?
- That money got to come out somehow, man.

6
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:39,205
So we ain't got to blast our way to the top floor.
We wait till they're in the street with their shit.

7
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:44,446
Yeah, we gonna do 'em tonight. You heard?
After it get dark.

8
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:51,564
Just like you say.

9
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:56,323
Put the basket down now! Put it down!
Fuck, l said put the basket down!

10
00:00:56,373 --> 00:01:00,082
- Easy girl, whoa, chill.
- Y'all niggers, you got caught slipping.

11
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:04,888
Sorry it had to go down like this, baby,
cos your ass is cute. Keep your hands up.

12
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:07,891
Nice, very nice.

13
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:17,881
- Bitches!
- That's somethin' you don't see every day.

15
00:03:22,573 --> 00:03:26,566
Kunta Kinte...yabba dabba dabba doo.

16
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:32,445
Mishy gishy gushy gushy mishy meshy mushy,
mothertucker!

17
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:41,012
You cannot travel halfway around the world
and not speak any mothertucking English.

18
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:45,764
English, mothertucker!

19
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,685
Two missing and the rest
ain't sayin' shit we understand.

20
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:53,123
Tried to tell you.
With the questions you all are asking.

21
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:58,201
- Off the ship, English is once again heard?
- Pretty much, yeah.

22
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:03,843
Here's what's left of Osman.
He was with us since Trieste.

23
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:07,929
Choksey took all his gear when he jumped.

24
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:11,010
- You get a lot of guys jumping ship?
- Some.

25
00:04:11,053 --> 00:04:13,931
Usually after a pay, which we made in Nortolk.

26
00:04:13,973 --> 00:04:17,568
Choksey asked for an advance,
which we did using ship's scrip.

27
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:23,210
Well, nothing here in the way of lD papers
or money. He grabbed that at least.

28
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:27,690
- Anybody else ask for any advances at sea?
- More than usual.

29
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:31,521
- Yeah?
- A few were coming back day after day.

30
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:35,771
Scripting more and more cash.
We figured they were gambling in the holds.

31
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:37,565
Maybe not, right?

32
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:44,970
The can with the girls was in Bay 9
on the bottom outside.

33
00:04:45,013 --> 00:04:47,208
- Did you check that bay?
- l did.

34
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:50,051
lt's full of cans for export,
loaded in Hampton Roads.

35
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:52,846
No sign of anything
but a fresh stack of containers.

36
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:58,286
lf you hold us another day and bring in
interpreters, they still won't say a damn thing.

37
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:03,691
The unwritten rule is that what happens
below decks stays below decks.

38
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:13,725
Sit up, Nicky, we got paying customers waiting.

39
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:18,964
Ashley, sit down.

40
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:22,924
You think l cut it too short?

41
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:25,924
Just don't make me look funny.

42
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:32,370
- Ashley's pre-school called.
- They want more money?

43
00:05:32,413 --> 00:05:35,689
Just what we owe 'em. And her teacher says...

44
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:38,770
Teacher? They ain't nothing but baby-sitters.

45
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:43,807
Whatever. Ashley's talking in class about
how Mommy and Daddy don't live together.

46
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:49,246
- Who asks them about that?
- No one asks, she just talks.

47
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:53,844
Kids notice stuff like that.
ln elementary school, it's gonna be an issue.

48
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:57,772
By the time she gets that far,
we'll be under the same roof.

49
00:05:57,813 --> 00:06:03,012
- You said that last Christmas.
- Christ, Aimee, you pulling it out or cutting it?

50
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:08,207
Listen, Nicky, you wanna go get
to someplace better, l'm with you.

51
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:14,283
You wanna keep on like this,
then l gotta rethink stuff.

52
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:18,484
Do what you feel.

53
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:23,766
As soon as l start getting more hours,
first thing l do is get my own place.

54
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:26,532
You wanna move in with me, great.

55
00:06:26,573 --> 00:06:30,771
You don't want to,
at least l did my goddamn best.

56
00:06:40,893 --> 00:06:44,647
Want a streak or something?
l could put a little purple in it.

57
00:06:46,253 --> 00:06:51,247
Yeah, and right after that, l'll just go ahead
and stick my tongue up some guy's ass.

58
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:23,364
Got you good, huh?

59
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:28,651
You think?

60
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:33,005
No, l mean... Well, not really. lf Evidence
Control is the posting you want, then...

61
00:07:36,493 --> 00:07:39,291
- Sorry, Lieutenant.
- Fuck it, right?

62
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,689
We brought in the case.
Heard you were on the boat.

63
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,848
Ain't so bad.

64
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:50,768
How's Kima?

65
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:55,728
She's inside. Asset Forteiture.
And she's second year pre-law.

66
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:58,571
House cat. That ain't her.

67
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:06,363
- This comin' back?
- Yeah. lt's the Gant case right there.

68
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:10,406
Nathan told me to go find Omar this week
or she drops charges.

69
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:12,444
- Got a line on him?
- Haven't a clue.

70
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:16,088
Last thing l did was put him on a bus
to New York.

71
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:26,244
You keep your head low, Lieutenant.
A year or two, you'll be back in favour.

72
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:29,410
Year or two and l'll be a lawyer.

73
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:32,445
l got 22 years in.
l'm putting the papers in this week.

74
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:35,482
You're gone, huh?

75
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:39,082
What the hell am l doing down here
with a law degree?

76
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:44,570
- You take care, McNulty.
- You too.

77
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:15,012
Kimmy, all l'm saying is, if you'd stop lightin' up
all the damn time, you'll understand...

78
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:17,248
- l'm gonna light up...
- lt took us too long.

79
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:22,651
Mothertucker, you know l love you,
but if your ass don't get to finishing counting...

80
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:26,368
- Shit, you know l love you, but damn.
- Almost five.

81
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:28,802
We got them mothertuckers good.

82
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:35,369
Let's see them mothertuckers slip next time...
Who the fuck is you?

83
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:39,326
- Omar come a-calling.
- Omar? Shit.

84
00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:42,968
Ain't that nigger dead?
l heard them project niggers lit him up.

85
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:45,846
l heard they ran his ass outta this town.

86
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,843
Spread the word, darlin', Omar back.

87
00:09:56,493 --> 00:10:01,692
Look! Look at the way Crutchfield
spelled ''prostrate''. Look at it.

88
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:04,930
''The above referenced victim
was prostate on the floor.''

89
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,964
Prostate on the floor!

90
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:11,682
''Prostate on the floor.'' That's a victim, all right.
That hurts bad!

91
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,644
- l love this job.
- Wanna hear about Philly, sarge?

92
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:20,890
- Just the dirty parts.
- The ship's a dead end.

93
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:25,165
The cargo bay that held our container
is full of new boxes. Nothing to recover.

94
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:30,162
The sailors lied to us in every language
past English. Gibbering mothertuckers.

95
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:34,604
- Sailing up the coast right now, laughing at us.
- ls that it?

96
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:39,124
Two jumped ship. We'll put out teletypes
in case that has anything to do with anything.

97
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:41,528
One left his gear. We kept that.

98
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:45,248
- Sounds like some weak-ass shit to me.
- Cos it is.

99
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:49,889
But your suspect had to be on the boat, right?
And your boat has sailed.

100
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:53,403
Jay, what the fuck were we supposed to do?

101
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:57,844
Hold the ship while we chat up a crew of 40
in 53 dialects? Come on.

102
00:10:57,893 --> 00:11:00,327
Well, if that isn't the plan, what is?

103
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:13,088
- Officer...?
- Russell.

104
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:20,446
l am informed that you are detailed to this case
as a liaison with the Port Police.

105
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:27,406
l also understand that you are the only help
that your department is sending.

106
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:32,527
- That's so.
- There is some charm to a woman in uniform.

107
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:36,248
But the fact remains we work plain clothes
in Homicide.

108
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:38,761
Not to say that the clothes need be plain.

109
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:42,328
For you, l would suggest some pantsuits
muted in colour.

110
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:46,971
Something to offset Detective Moreland's
pinstriped, lawyerly affectations

111
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:50,562
and the brash, tweedy impertinence
of Detective Freamon.

112
00:11:51,453 --> 00:11:53,842
Rawls is watching on this one.

113
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:57,373
Let's at least pretend we got a fucking clue.

114
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,244
Tweedy impertinence?

115
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:07,481
l like that, know what l'm saying?

116
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:12,649
- lt's not here, Major.
- l can see that. Where is it?

117
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:14,968
The Flex Squad used it last Tuesday.

118
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:20,007
The vehicle log says they parked it
at 2200 hours, returning the keys to the OlC.

119
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:23,011
- And?
- We have the keys.

120
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:25,044
But not the van.

121
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:33,170
Are you telling me that
a fully-equipped $120,000 surveillance van

122
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:37,331
assigned to the Southeastern District
cannot be located?

123
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:57,010
Around the world in 880 days.

124
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:18,483
- Do we have a plan?
- A plan?

125
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:21,127
For targeting this guy Sobotka.

126
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:23,004
l don't know.

127
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:26,329
Maybe find out where his union hangs.

128
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:29,171
Go there with a Cl or two,
make some hand-to-hands.

129
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:32,649
- How about some DNRs on his phones?
- DNRs?

130
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:35,446
See who he's calling, look for a pattern.

131
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:38,212
Hand-to-hands for now, l think.

132
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:13,049
600 shares.

133
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:18,804
- That's right.
- This is too nice a block for a prison guard.

134
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:21,845
You couldn't pay me enough to work
in no prison.

135
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:24,930
Yeah, right.
l want you to drop all the cellular joints.

136
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:28,249
Yeah, all of 'em. Nokia, Motorola.

137
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:30,966
Listen to Stringer play Wall Street.

138
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:32,571
All right, call me.

139
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:36,970
Yo, String, why are you so down
on the phone companies, man?

140
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:39,811
A while back, l took a stroll through the Pit.

141
00:14:39,853 --> 00:14:44,051
l saw that kid we got runnin' things
down there - Poot.

142
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:47,403
He got the cell phone l gave him
for the business on his hip,

143
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:51,731
but the nigger got another cell phone
that only ring when the pussy call.

144
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:54,162
lf this no-account nigger got two cell phones,

145
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:57,762
how the fuck you gonna sell
any more of them mothertuckers?

146
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,324
That's market saturation.

147
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:07,932
Lookee here. Lookee here.

148
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:11,727
- That Tilghman right there.
- Dressed like a prison guard and all?

149
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:13,570
l see him.

150
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:20,805
Steel door. The boy on the step is all, though.

151
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,163
Stump is sitting in the front room window
staring at the damn TV.

152
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:28,001
- Y'all could see that from the step?
- There in his damn drawers.

153
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,452
Rat make that trash, he home free.

154
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:45,690
Junk better get in closer
if he want a shot at him.

155
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:53,005
l got 20 on Mr Rat. Anyone fade me?

156
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:57,447
Move along. Come on, get there.

157
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:03,091
- 100 says it ain't over.
- Shit, l got to take easy money.

158
00:16:04,773 --> 00:16:06,764
What the fuck?!

159
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:11,684
- Mothertucker!
- Sounds about over now, though.

160
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:18,443
- How the hell did he know what the rat'd do?
- Junk do know his varmints!

161
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:42,641
What's wrong with you, boy?

162
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:49,243
Look, l done told you before, man,
them two babies don't move me that way.

163
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:53,730
lf l come up with a plan to do Stump
without 'em, you'd cut 'em loose?

164
00:16:53,773 --> 00:16:56,845
Now you gone and got strategic on me, huh?

165
00:16:56,893 --> 00:17:00,568
We do like last time
and wait for him to come out.

166
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:04,322
Only problem is
Stump live in that rat hole, baby.

167
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:11,004
So he ain't got to bring the cash out.
See what l'm saying?

168
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:13,772
Then we charge in, guns a-blazing.

169
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,924
Steel door, right?

170
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:24,492
Look, Dante, what's it gonna take for you
to be convinced, man? l don't bag no babies.

171
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:30,564
What you think?

172
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:55,331
You gonna have to do better than that.

173
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:58,010
Oh, indeed?

174
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:09,765
l'm thinking, maybe do a quarter this time
if it's not too much.

175
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:12,122
That a problem?

176
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:17,452
No, no.
l'm just sayin', you back right quick with it.

177
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:22,729
Well, it ain't like them mothertuckers
got anything else to do up in there, right?

178
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:27,082
- The shit is everyday, man.
- Sound right. lt count right?

179
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,611
Boy'll bring it to you outside.

180
00:18:37,973 --> 00:18:39,964
There's Tilghman.

181
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:51,932
So, his shit comin' from Butchie, then?

182
00:18:53,653 --> 00:18:56,451
- All right.
- Lyin' Butchie.

183
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:03,441
- Santa's elves are short.
- Santa's elves aren't real.

184
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:06,166
The elves in Lord Of The Rings
are real elves.

185
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:08,807
- Real elves?
- They should be short.

186
00:19:08,853 --> 00:19:13,927
Dwarves are short, Hobbits are short.
Elves are tall and immortal.

187
00:19:13,973 --> 00:19:17,807
lf you weren't too scared to watch the movie,
you'd know all about it, doofus.

188
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:20,811
- Bite me, dick-breath.
- Sean, knock it off.

189
00:19:20,853 --> 00:19:22,969
He started it.

190
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:27,370
OK, upstairs right away, brush your teeth,
pyjamas. lt's a school night.

191
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:31,404
Can l tuck 'em in?

192
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,325
My lawyer will be sending you something
in the mail.

193
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:42,049
- You're kidding?
- lt's not a divorce, it's a separation agreement.

194
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:46,883
- A separation agreement?
- Just read it. OK? lt's for the both of us.

195
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:49,811
- lt's to protect the both of us.
- This is about what?

196
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:52,845
lt's just...

197
00:19:53,853 --> 00:19:56,811
You should just read it, OK?

198
00:19:59,693 --> 00:20:00,921
OK.

199
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:22,003
Another goddamn day we put our cards up
and get nothin'.

200
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:26,524
- Zig, l don't know why l fucking bother.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

201
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:28,962
One ship today, nothing yesterday.

202
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:34,167
Wait for Thursday, a couple RO/ROs come in
and congratu-fucking-lations, you grab a day.

203
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:36,169
Friday's quiet again.

204
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:39,489
Well, look at it this way,
at least you get the day off.

205
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:41,922
Days off is the fucking point, Zig.

206
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:49,284
l can't keep waking up in the morning
not knowing if l'm gonna get paid.

207
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,767
l got a kid, right? l got a fucking kid

208
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:54,805
and a girl that wants to get married,
for Christ's sake.

209
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,845
What the fuck do you wanna get married for?

210
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:03,723
Not saying l do, but fuck if l even could
without no pot to piss in.

211
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:08,730
Aimee's, like, ''What's the plan?'' you know?

212
00:21:08,773 --> 00:21:12,607
And l'm down here wondering
if l'm gonna get a day or two.

213
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:17,050
Hey, Aimee's sister broke up with Petie, right?

214
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:24,802
That's your problem, Zig. One of 'em.
You let that thing of yours lead you around.

215
00:21:24,853 --> 00:21:27,890
- You know me. Whisky, cock and five o'clock!
- Get off.

216
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:32,768
Nicky, look, if it's money that
you're worried about, shit, you know...

217
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:39,405
Let's pool a few dollars together.
l'll get us hooked up with a little llello.

218
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:43,844
Turn it around, we'd make more money
than we can down here all week.

219
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:47,090
l ain't standing on no corner
like some fucking project nigger

220
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:49,852
so that l get popped for pocket change.

221
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:53,488
Fuck that shit, Zig. Seriously.

222
00:21:54,653 --> 00:21:57,725
- What are you gonna do?
- l'll think of something.

223
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,291
1 1900 on that one.

224
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,769
We're looking for 1 4580 by the manifest.

225
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:12,008
Can't be. The numbers don't go that high.

226
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:15,250
You had to figure it'd be this way,
the way the port works.

227
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:21,289
Why have anything other than fake companies
and addresses if you're moving contraband?

228
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,642
And on the other end, too, right?

229
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:27,442
You could work it back through Customs,

230
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:32,442
but chances are this box wasn't picked up
anywhere near this Rue de Rivoli address

231
00:22:32,493 --> 00:22:34,484
in Le Havre, France.

232
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:38,606
Hell, there might not even be
a Rue de Rivoli in that town.

233
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:46,366
A can full of dead girls
sent to nowhere from nowhere.

234
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:15,325
- He been good business for me, though.
- Yeah?

235
00:23:15,373 --> 00:23:19,764
Two, three quarters a week. Mr Tilghman's
money always right, always on time.

236
00:23:19,813 --> 00:23:22,611
That's why we comin' to you for the set-up.

237
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:24,723
- You the man to him.
- l'm just saying...

238
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:28,083
l know, the money.
We'll find a way to make that right.

239
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:33,924
But, like l said, l'm not askin' for myself,
l'm asking for my man.

240
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:40,086
- Avon's call, huh?
- Wouldn't be here otherwise.

241
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:44,846
- Avon is Avon.
- Always.

242
00:23:50,573 --> 00:23:53,292
He probably gonna roll past tomorrow.

243
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:56,890
That'd work.

244
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:08,332
lt makes no sense to bring the girls
all this way and then kill them.

245
00:24:08,373 --> 00:24:12,082
You dump 'em on your old boss
and here you are worrying the case.

246
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:15,728
- lt's got me thinking, is all.
- lt's a little late for that, McNulty.

247
00:24:15,773 --> 00:24:19,561
What connects the one girl in the water
with all the others in the can?

248
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:23,208
- lf you're right and she isn't local...
- She's definitely not local.

249
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:27,963
The low level of mercury viscosity in the
amalgam restorations says Eastern Europe.

250
00:24:28,013 --> 00:24:31,210
- lf you say so.
- Trust me, she's not from Dundalk.

251
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:34,962
Eastern Europe, huh?
Can you narrow it down some?

252
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:39,723
How's this? Three of the dead girls were
in Budapest, Hungary, some time last year.

253
00:24:39,773 --> 00:24:42,970
- How'd you know that?
- They bought tits there.

254
00:24:44,053 --> 00:24:48,331
Three girls had breast enhancements.
We looked at the bags during the post.

255
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:54,130
We pulled the serial numbers and they trace
back to a plastic surgery clinic in Budapest.

256
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:56,971
Did you call 'em?
Might pull an lD from patient records.

257
00:24:57,013 --> 00:25:01,165
The best they could tell me is
that the implants were used this fall.

258
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:05,206
Three girls, three surgeries, same clinic, right?
What else?

259
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:08,848
- Fuck you, Jimmy McNulty.
- OK, you're a fucking god.

260
00:25:08,893 --> 00:25:12,852
There's no one in the game
who can stand in your light, Dr Frazier, sir.

261
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:16,363
You have to admit
that whole Budapest thing was a helluva pull.

262
00:25:16,413 --> 00:25:20,326
- Hey, where's the paperwork on this guy?
- l got it over here.

263
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:22,409
- Go on, what else?
- Not much.

264
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:28,449
The swabs show that at least seven girls had
vaginal intercourse within 24 hours of death.

265
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,087
Two had anal, six came back positive on oral.

266
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:34,728
Whoa. You tell Cole about all this?

267
00:25:34,773 --> 00:25:38,607
l sent the preliminary findings up to Homicide,
but Cole ain't on the case.

268
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:43,124
- No? Who is?
- Your man Bunk and his partner. They ate it.

269
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:48,650
Thanks.

270
00:25:57,533 --> 00:26:00,525
Hey, l told you l'd buy you a soda.

271
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,085
That better?

272
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:07,524
Now, look at me.
Don't let those mean boys see you crying.

273
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:09,564
- OK?
- OK.

274
00:26:10,093 --> 00:26:12,084
l'll take care of you.

275
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:33,132
Mr Stump!

276
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:44,122
Mr Stump.
Them boys been teasin' Chantelle again.

277
00:26:54,373 --> 00:26:56,091
You know it.

278
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,444
- Morning.
- Morning.

279
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:17,123
- Hey, Bobby, how you been?
- Not bad.

280
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:21,132
- Working the tier today?
- Yeah, on J.

281
00:28:26,213 --> 00:28:28,807
- Have a good one.
- Yeah, you too.

282
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:31,249
Oh, you happy now, bitch?

283
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:35,366
How was l gonna know Landsman
would pull Cole and stick you guys?

284
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,450
- You here with 'em?
- What did he call Cole?

285
00:28:38,493 --> 00:28:42,611
- Collateral damage.
- l'm feelin' pretty damn collateral myself.

286
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:46,043
Which is why l went to see Doc Frazier
and worked some things out.

287
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:48,653
McNulty could've paid this thing no mind.

288
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:52,527
But, no, when his friends are suffering,
he bleeds, too.

289
00:28:52,573 --> 00:28:58,091
Did you see the preliminary?
Positives for oral, vaginal, anal.

290
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:03,491
No lDs, no passports, no visas, no real money
and they're coming across the water like that.

291
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,764
- McNulty has a theory.
- Does he now?

292
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:12,331
- You deductive mothertucker, you.
- So he'll wander in here with some bullshit

293
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:15,968
about how these girls
all coming over here as prostitutes.

294
00:29:16,013 --> 00:29:19,449
How, if they ain't got the cash to travel better
than a container ship,

295
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:22,166
they don't have the money
to pay a plastic surgeon.

296
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:26,047
Then he's gonna say something
about that one in the water

297
00:29:26,093 --> 00:29:29,881
being tossed off the ship
after she's already dead from a beat down.

298
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:33,403
But why has she got beat?
He'll ask us that like we don't know.

299
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:40,404
He'll answer his own question. Her swabs are
negative. Fuck or fight with them sailor boys.

300
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:45,527
- And she fought.
- So it got a little rough. She comes up dead.

301
00:29:45,573 --> 00:29:50,363
Somebody panics, tosses her in the harbour
overnight before the ship ties up.

302
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:55,567
- But the other girls saw.
- So they get told to get back in that can.

303
00:29:55,613 --> 00:30:01,643
And our man, to cover this shit up, he gets
up on top and bangs down the air pipe.

304
00:30:04,573 --> 00:30:08,566
- Anything else you want to tell us?
- When did you guys get there?

305
00:30:08,613 --> 00:30:12,083
Yesterday, when the first mate told us
while the ship was at sea,

306
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:15,170
half the crew asked for advances
on their salary.

307
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:19,604
They had one helluva dice game going on
or they popped them girls out of that can.

308
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:22,121
- You talk to the crew?
- ln what language?

309
00:30:22,173 --> 00:30:24,050
- Crime scene?
- Nope.

310
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:26,482
- Anybody missing?
- Two guys jumped ship.

311
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:32,085
One in Philly, one in Nortolk.
But that shit happens all the time, apparently.

312
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:36,126
- Got yourself a hell of a case.
- Fuck you very much.

313
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:41,887
You know what happens to the girls if you don't
lD them. Anatomy Board as medical cadavers.

314
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:44,925
Then a crematorium,
then a mass grave at Crownsville.

315
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:48,170
- That bothers you?
- Yeah, a little.

316
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,726
Me too.

317
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:00,805
- Thanks for hosting this, Father.
- Hope it helps.

318
00:31:00,853 --> 00:31:06,052
This is more presence than the port unions
have shown in years.

319
00:31:06,093 --> 00:31:10,211
- But is the Governor listening?
- lt's now or never for us.

320
00:31:10,253 --> 00:31:12,813
Not just the grain pier, but with the dredging

321
00:31:12,853 --> 00:31:15,925
cos, whatever the engineers' study says,
the fact is...

322
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:18,168
Excuse me. l'll bring him right back.

323
00:31:18,213 --> 00:31:21,205
- l need him to work the other side of the room.
- No problem.

324
00:31:22,853 --> 00:31:27,881
You're wasting time here.
Bobby's District 7, which is Middle River.

325
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:33,246
Most of his votes have a port connection.
He's a good vote, no matter what we do.

326
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:38,526
The guys to work are those who wouldn't have
shown up if we hadn't thrown money at 'em.

327
00:31:38,573 --> 00:31:41,645
- Like who?
- John Carney from Anne Arundel.

328
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:47,404
Liz Tobin from Montgomery. Clay Davis.
Keep hold of them, some of your stuff stays.

329
00:31:47,453 --> 00:31:50,331
- They're with us?
- Carney's pretty firm.

330
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:53,206
Liz will stay solid
if the environmentalists don't get to her.

331
00:31:53,253 --> 00:31:57,451
Clay Davis - you wanna make sure
you're the last man out of the room.

332
00:31:57,493 --> 00:31:59,211
What do you mean?

333
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:02,450
We gave 40 large
to the Westside Democratic Organisation.

334
00:32:02,493 --> 00:32:06,884
- This mothertucker still has his hand out.
- We spent $40,000 on that guy?

335
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:10,323
Worth it, if he lets your project
sail through committee.

336
00:32:10,373 --> 00:32:14,651
- 40 fucking thousand?
- Am l your lobbyist? Are you paying me?

337
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:19,244
Trust me. With the players in this room
and a little help from the Governor's office,

338
00:32:19,293 --> 00:32:23,684
we might just squeeze some things
out of this session. Go and make nice.

339
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:31,531
- Senator Davis.
- Excuse me.

340
00:32:33,093 --> 00:32:34,890
Hey, partner.

341
00:32:36,093 --> 00:32:38,687
l hear it might be a good year for the port.

342
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:43,124
Might be. You all have been steppin' up
in a lot of ways.

343
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:47,883
Hope it continues like that.
Y'all makin' friends in a lot of places, right?

344
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,685
We're friendly guys.

345
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:05,922
So they came back murders, huh?
l admit, l didn't see that coming at all.

346
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:08,362
Who could've seen that?

347
00:33:08,413 --> 00:33:12,406
For whoever had these girls brought over,
the net loss is in the millions.

348
00:33:12,453 --> 00:33:15,365
- That much?
- One of these girls on the circuit,

349
00:33:15,413 --> 00:33:19,611
going up and down the East Coast
can bring in half a million in a couple of years.

350
00:33:19,653 --> 00:33:23,202
- That's just for club work and prostitution.
- Somebody messed up.

351
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:28,566
- ln a big way.
- You called it. No such address in Le Havre.

352
00:33:28,613 --> 00:33:31,173
Or, for that matter, anywhere in Brittany.

353
00:33:31,213 --> 00:33:34,125
The lD of the driver
who signed the bill of lading over there

354
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:36,971
doesn't correspond
to their motor vehicle database.

355
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:39,686
Dead ends either way.

356
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:43,043
- The girls know what they're coming over for?
- Some do.

357
00:33:43,093 --> 00:33:46,563
Some get told they're just gonna dance
or be secretaries.

358
00:33:46,613 --> 00:33:51,289
They come from places that don't have much.
Romania, Moldova, Russia, Albania.

359
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:55,042
40,000 or 50,000 undocumented women
working in the US alone.

360
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:57,482
50,000? Jesus!

361
00:33:57,533 --> 00:34:00,525
They need a new agency just to police 'em.

362
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:02,768
What they need is a union.

363
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:08,163
- To Stan and Kate.
- Stan and Kate.

364
00:34:10,413 --> 00:34:12,608
Happy anniversary!

365
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:16,401
Thanks a lot.

366
00:34:18,453 --> 00:34:20,444
- Good time here, huh?
- Yeah, Pop.

367
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:25,487
How's my detail coming? Lieutenant Grayson,
he's on top of things, right?

368
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:30,129
Burrell recommended him.
Said he was really good at property crimes.

369
00:34:30,173 --> 00:34:32,926
We... lt's gonna take a while.

370
00:34:32,973 --> 00:34:35,965
You think? Why? What are you doin'?

371
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:41,161
Not much.

372
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:44,808
We got no DNRs up.
We're not looking at any union assets.

373
00:34:44,853 --> 00:34:48,846
We're not collecting tag numbers.
We're not looking for patterns.

374
00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:52,283
That's what l've been trying to tell you
about the Barksdale thing.

375
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:56,485
lf you just eat around the edges,
you never get a meal.

376
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:59,969
Daniels and Freamon
had us pulling all kind of stuff.

377
00:35:00,013 --> 00:35:04,723
DMV records, phone logs, corporate charters,
political campaign contributions.

378
00:35:04,773 --> 00:35:06,968
lf Burrell didn't break the case down so fast,

379
00:35:07,013 --> 00:35:10,608
we'd have brought back three or four million
in real estate,

380
00:35:10,653 --> 00:35:14,248
not to mention the money
those guys gave to political campaigns.

381
00:35:14,293 --> 00:35:16,409
We were deep, really deep.

382
00:35:17,373 --> 00:35:23,846
l've been trying to tell you, if it wasn't
for Burrell, that would've been a major case.

383
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:35,569
- Hey.
- String.

384
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:41,204
You know, l just came to check up on you,
see how you holdin' it down.

385
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:43,608
- l'm all right.
- Where the little man at?

386
00:35:43,653 --> 00:35:45,644
l just put him down.

387
00:35:50,293 --> 00:35:52,443
You want somethin' to drink?

388
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:58,645
Do D'Angelo know what he's missing?

389
00:35:58,693 --> 00:36:00,968
l'm sure he do.

390
00:36:04,293 --> 00:36:07,012
You just reminded me about something.

391
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:24,766
Tag's still on it.
He bought it before he got stopped in Jersey.

392
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:31,007
Never been worn. You know,
it's a shame to let things go to waste.

393
00:36:35,613 --> 00:36:40,607
You can give away the man's clothes,
but that don't make him gone, right?

394
00:36:41,253 --> 00:36:44,051
- l ain't forget him.
- You ain't been to see him much.

395
00:36:44,093 --> 00:36:48,211
- lt's been hard.
- lt's been hard? lt's been hard on him, too.

396
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:51,563
Lot of bad things caught up in a man's head
when he's on lock-down.

397
00:36:51,613 --> 00:36:55,288
Man need to see his baby mama and his child.

398
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:59,087
Only one thing he needs to be secure about
and, if not,

399
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:04,332
he might start thinking he can't do that time
and then we all got problems.

400
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,801
Do you understand me?

401
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:13,246
How you set here? The apartment,
the car, the money's all right?

402
00:37:13,293 --> 00:37:16,205
- lt's good.
- lt's good?

403
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:19,924
l know it's good.

404
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:23,362
You know what l'm talkin' about.

405
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:27,929
We all got a job to do and your job is
to let D'Angelo know we still family.

406
00:37:30,253 --> 00:37:32,244
lt's important.

407
00:37:40,613 --> 00:37:42,604
l'm an XL.

408
00:37:46,693 --> 00:37:48,684
No doubt.

409
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,922
- Your round, Jimmy.
- Jesus.

410
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:53,205
l'll owe the babysitter half my salary
if l don't throw myself out of here now.

411
00:38:53,653 --> 00:38:55,803
- You got kids?
- Two.

412
00:38:55,853 --> 00:38:59,163
- Daddy working late, too?
- Not a day in his goddamn life.

413
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,773
No, no, no, you barely made a dent.

414
00:39:06,573 --> 00:39:08,768
- Night, gents.
- Night.

415
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:13,012
- What's that about?
- l don't know.

416
00:39:14,173 --> 00:39:17,609
Here... l'll tell you what l'm gonna do.

417
00:39:17,653 --> 00:39:20,850
- Solve the fucking case?
- Not a shot.

418
00:39:23,893 --> 00:39:26,612
- l'm gonna give this one a name.
- A name?

419
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:32,765
She's not going out to Crownsville, this one.
Not on me, she's not.

420
00:39:32,813 --> 00:39:38,126
What are you gonna do with her? Pay for a box
and a mortician and ship her back to Europe?

421
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:41,961
- No, l'm gonna find where her people are at.
- How does that matter?

422
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:49,124
You see, this is that Catholic shit, Jimmy.
This is that little altar-boy guilt talking.

423
00:39:49,173 --> 00:39:53,644
- What the fuck l gotta feel guilty about?
- Let me count the ways.

424
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:59,124
Good morning, Major.

425
00:40:22,613 --> 00:40:24,604
What the...?

426
00:40:28,573 --> 00:40:31,292
''Wilmington''? Son of a bitch!

427
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:39,404
Frank?

428
00:40:39,453 --> 00:40:41,444
Hey, Ring, how's it hanging?

429
00:40:43,253 --> 00:40:44,971
Not so good.

430
00:40:45,013 --> 00:40:47,607
- Not right now.
- Yeah?

431
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:52,526
l'm late on my dues. You know that, right?

432
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:54,882
You're late, yeah.

433
00:40:54,933 --> 00:41:00,963
l'm parking that piece-of-shit Buick two blocks
from the house, hoping for a lazy repo man.

434
00:41:01,013 --> 00:41:06,212
That bad? l know you ain't been getting hours.
lt's been slow.

435
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:10,647
- Five days last month. That's all.
- ls that all?

436
00:41:11,253 --> 00:41:16,532
Look, l got to shit or get off the pot here.

There's 60 checkers above me

439
00:41:24,933 --> 00:41:28,403

451
00:43:05,973 --> 00:43:08,931
My man'll pick it up there. Thanks, Horse.

452
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:03,533
Code is 1 098, OK?

453
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:09,524
Wrong box, misdelivery.

454
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:22,490
No need to count, Butch. My shit always right.

455
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:25,001
Hearing. Hearing is believing!

456
00:44:30,253 --> 00:44:33,529
Boy'll meet you outside when you ready to roll.

458
00:44:38,853 --> 00:44:41,651
No, dog, not from me you don't.

00:44:44,813 --> 00:44:46,610
Later, Butchie.

460
00:44:51,093 --> 00:44:53,561
Your man Avon ain't got no flex.

461
00:44:54,373 --> 00:44:56,091
'Fraid not.

462
00:45:06,693 --> 00:45:10,606
Who do you like better?
Ultimate Spider-Man or regular Spider-Man?

463
00:45:10,653 --> 00:45:14,123
- What's the difference?
- l'll have to teach you everything.

464
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:26,051
Excuse me, gents.

465
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,888
What's up? How you liking the library?

466
00:45:33,933 --> 00:45:35,924

lt's easy on you. l know a lot of people

469
00:45:49,493 --> 00:45:55,045
Ain't gotta say shit, but take heed of what can
be done for you if you keep your head straight.

470
00:45:55,093 --> 00:45:57,288
You just full of favours, ain't you?

471
00:45:59,093 --> 00:46:02,802
You shut your mouth and you open your mind

472
00:46:02,853 --> 00:46:06,323
and you ain't gonna be doing
but a small piece of this 20.

473
00:46:06,373 --> 00:46:10,366
Just like l'm only gonna do a year or two
on this seven, feel me?

474
00:46:10,413 --> 00:46:14,201
l got priors. Best l can do is half.

475
00:46:14,253 --> 00:46:16,767
That's 10. l can count to 10, yo.

476
00:46:17,613 --> 00:46:20,332
Yo, some shit is comin' down, Dee, OK?

477
00:46:20,373 --> 00:46:25,527
You need to think, you need to trust,
and you need to get your head right.

478
00:46:25,893 --> 00:46:29,681
- Man, my head is where l want it.
- You look dusty lately.

479
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:33,646
So what? So what?
What, you my mom up in here now?

480
00:46:33,693 --> 00:46:38,926
Yo, man, that's the weak man's road
you're taking.

481
00:46:38,973 --> 00:46:41,362
l ain't never seen you as weak.

482
00:46:43,933 --> 00:46:47,528
l'm just... You know, every now and again.

483
00:46:47,573 --> 00:46:50,770
That's all l got to get my head up
outta this shit hole.

484
00:46:50,813 --> 00:46:55,603
Ain't no more than that? lf so, you should
be able to give it a rest for a few days.

485
00:46:55,653 --> 00:46:59,532
- Cos it ain't no thing, right?
- Yeah, it ain't no thing.

486
00:46:59,573 --> 00:47:01,643
Then you gonna do that?

487
00:47:05,453 --> 00:47:08,650
l'm askin' you, man, out of love.

488
00:47:10,573 --> 00:47:12,564
There's always love, Dee.

489
00:47:18,173 --> 00:47:21,210
All right. Yeah.

490
00:47:21,253 --> 00:47:24,245
A few days. Sure, a few days.

491
00:47:25,533 --> 00:47:27,330
Right.

492
00:48:14,653 --> 00:48:17,121
All right, what have you got?

493
00:48:18,413 --> 00:48:23,533
All digital. 4 megapix, 16 megs of memory,
3-time optical, 4-time digital zoom.

494
00:48:23,573 --> 00:48:26,087
- New on the market.
- The Cadillac of cameras.

495
00:48:26,133 --> 00:48:27,964
- How many?
- 400.

496
00:48:29,093 --> 00:48:33,371
- You are talking a big number.
- lt's show time, baby. This ain't the WNBA.

497
00:48:34,093 --> 00:48:39,611
l'm thinking with these features, this brand,
l can get maybe 350 each at retail.

498
00:48:39,653 --> 00:48:43,441
- All right, cool.
- Nope, not cool. 500.

499
00:48:44,813 --> 00:48:49,091
l've been calling some of the local chain stores.
Best Buy, Circuit City.

500
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:54,082
This model goes for 550.
500 when they're on sale.

501
00:48:54,133 --> 00:49:00,288
- OK, 500. Times 400 units, that comes to...
- 200,000.

502
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:04,088
- What are you looking for?
- 20 percent.

503
00:49:05,973 --> 00:49:07,964
There's three of us.

504
00:49:08,013 --> 00:49:12,962
l want a woman with thin ankles, but l'm going
home tonight and there's going to be my wife.

505
00:49:13,013 --> 00:49:16,483
Eight per cent. 16,000.

506
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:21,163
That's over $5,000 apiece
for you and your friends.

507
00:49:21,973 --> 00:49:24,885
$20,000. Upfront.

508
00:49:28,253 --> 00:49:30,050
Because l like you.

509
00:49:30,853 --> 00:49:33,651
Look at that, it's a Kodak moment in the house!

510
00:49:38,733 --> 00:49:43,523
l got to run this by my people.
They OK it, l'm going to give you a call.

511
00:49:44,933 --> 00:49:46,969
All right, cool.

512
00:49:53,933 --> 00:49:56,493
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

513
00:49:56,533 --> 00:50:00,526
You gonna insult my ace,
you check-and-raise piece of shit?

514
00:50:00,573 --> 00:50:05,249
- Fuck you, Augie, see it or fold.
- l'll see it and raise you back.

515
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,761
- Talk to me.
- 'tenshun!

516
00:50:12,173 --> 00:50:17,327
- Where's the lieutenant?
- He's...on the street.

517
00:50:33,973 --> 00:50:38,046
l'm not a politician.
l wouldn't even know how to count the votes.

518
00:50:38,093 --> 00:50:40,243
Maybe they know it's our time.

519
00:50:42,533 --> 00:50:44,330
Hey, Tony.

520
00:50:46,373 --> 00:50:48,967
Too soon to call you Commissioner?

521
00:50:50,053 --> 00:50:52,044
Excuse me one sec.

522
00:50:54,293 --> 00:50:56,488
- You sent me humps.
- Major?

523
00:50:56,533 --> 00:50:58,888
You sent me a detail of humps.

524
00:50:58,933 --> 00:51:03,529
- We can discuss this tomorrow.
- No, l think we discuss it now,

525
00:51:03,573 --> 00:51:09,443
or l'm gonna walk in there and tell Santoni
to vote against this goddamn coronation.

526
00:51:09,493 --> 00:51:15,489
And l'll talk to some of my friends about what
happened at the end of the Barksdale case.

527
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:20,209
- Do you hear me on that?
- That case was a successful prosecution.

528
00:51:20,253 --> 00:51:22,721
Up until our people tried to chase the cash.

529
00:51:22,773 --> 00:51:27,164
We have a quorum, l believe.
Council members can take their seats now.

530
00:51:30,373 --> 00:51:36,369
Tell you what, you probably got enough votes,
but l can make it uglier than you want it.

531
00:51:36,413 --> 00:51:37,846
What do you want, Stan?

532
00:51:37,893 --> 00:51:42,489
l want a real detail
with real police and a real unit commander.

533
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:46,492
- Fine, done.
- Gimme that lieutenant that did Barksdale.

534
00:51:46,533 --> 00:51:49,411
Daniels put in his papers.
He's gone, out the door.

535
00:51:49,453 --> 00:51:52,490
Did he meet the Pension Board yet?

536
00:51:52,533 --> 00:51:55,605
- l suggest you talk to the man.
- l'll do what l can.

537
00:51:55,653 --> 00:51:59,805
Don't fuck with me, Erv. l got as many friends
here in the hall as you do.

538
00:51:59,853 --> 00:52:05,564
With what l'm learnin' about the Barksdale
case, l got all kind of shit l can throw.

539
00:52:21,373 --> 00:52:23,682
- Lock-down in 20.
- All right.

540
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,884
Yo, what's up, lce?

541
00:53:11,893 --> 00:53:16,284
- You done with that ''Green Lantern''?
- You can read it, but l want it back.

542
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:19,052
- You hit Dee?
- Dee ain't up.

543
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:25,168
400 good cameras, Spiros.

544
00:53:28,213 --> 00:53:31,410
- Who brought them in?
- The young stevedore Niko.

545
00:53:31,453 --> 00:53:35,446
And that idiot cousin of his.

546
00:53:40,373 --> 00:53:42,364
And l think he uses, too.

547
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:45,650
Stefanos.

548
00:53:48,013 --> 00:53:50,732
l don't give a damn nothing about him.

549
00:53:50,773 --> 00:53:54,209
l'm paying 10 cents on the dollar
for the cameras.

550
00:53:54,253 --> 00:53:57,370
We're going to clear, what, 180,000.

551
00:53:57,413 --> 00:54:00,086
- What about Niko?
- He's smart.

552
00:54:02,733 --> 00:54:04,724
Make the deal.

553
00:54:11,013 --> 00:54:14,005
- What the hell's wrong with you tonight?
- What?

554
00:54:14,053 --> 00:54:16,328
You're acting normal.

555
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:19,731
You know what, Dolores?

556
00:54:19,773 --> 00:54:23,368
- l made money today.
- Yeah? What ship was in?

557
00:54:25,733 --> 00:54:27,132
Hey, Zig.

558
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:31,571
Shot and a beer, Dolores.

559
00:54:33,133 --> 00:54:35,169
Frank Sobotka says l needed it.

560
00:54:54,893 --> 00:54:58,363
- What's this?
- Your change. Or so says Frank Sobotka.

561
00:55:03,373 --> 00:55:05,568
- Sure?
- lt ain't mine, for Christ's sake.

562
00:55:05,613 --> 00:55:08,047
lf you don't take it, someone else is gonna.

563
00:55:19,253 --> 00:55:21,244
Your pop's a good man, Zig.

564
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:06,722
Yo, up here!

565
00:56:22,133 --> 00:56:25,125
Hey, TC? Yo, TC, what's up?

Yo, what the fuck is going on?

569
00:56:40,493 --> 00:56:42,529
Bad package, yo. Hot shot.

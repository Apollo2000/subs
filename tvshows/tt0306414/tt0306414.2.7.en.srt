OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Something in particular?

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,200
-Funeral.
-I'm sorry.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,700
No, funeral, you know?

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,900
No, I mean, I'm sorry for your loss.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,400
Yeah.

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,400
That's a popular one.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,100
-Who was it that passed, a relation?
-No, we worked together.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,100
-I see. A professional relationship.
-Yeah, professional.

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,000
I mean, we wasn't all that tight,
but he was still my nigger.

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,100
I think I'm on it. Follow me.

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,100
Hell, yeah, this what I'm talking about.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,500
That gat and grip thing
over there sells a lot.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,900
We can do that in white,
or red, or pink carnations.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,100
-Pink?
-Your boy was too fierce for the pink?

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,000
No, he wasn't all that.

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,600
But when you stand with a nigger,
you stand with him to the end...

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,700
otherwise you ain't nothing yourself.

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,200
True that. How did your boy fall?

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,500
Hung himself.

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,900
Over at The Cut, strung himself up.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,700
Judge ran wild on his ass, gave him 20.

23
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,900
I guess he couldn't handle
all those years, you know?

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's a weak-ass nigger
when you think about it.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,100
But it ain't no reason to drag
his name down no further, you know?

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,900
I'll tell you what.
Let me get something in strong colors.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,100
Red, black, whatever.
But make it look like one of the Towers...

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,800
down on Franklin Terrace.
You know, the high-rises.

29
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,100
You want the arrangement
to look like a high-rise housing project?

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,700
Hell, yeah.

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,700
And put the numbers 221
in big-ass numbers on the front.

32
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,100
All right? He used to have that
Fremont Tower for a while.

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,000
221, all right.
Anything else you want it to say?

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Like what?

35
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,500
"Rest in peace," "In Remembrance,"
something like that?

36
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,700
Something that says
how you feel about the loss.

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Look, man, fuck it, all right? Just....

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,500
Just make sure the Towers
look like they do, all right?

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,100
All right. Thanks.

40
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,600
-You cloned a what?
-A computer.

41
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,800
We can watch how the cargo
comes off the ship in real time...

42
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,000
try to follow the contraband,
see where it leads.

43
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,000
We're running a 25-murder-a-month
MASH Unit here...

44
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,700
and you guys wanna slow things down a bit,
and do a bit of brain surgery.

45
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,400
If Rawls comes walking through here
and sees the two of you hunched over...

46
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,900
playing video games on 14 open murders,
he's gonna blow!

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,400
That is exactly why we asked Lt. Daniels...

48
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,100
to set us up at his off-site,
over in the southeast.

49
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,000
They're looking at the dock boys
for other shit, drugs mostly.

50
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,700
-Daniels, who used to be in Narcotics?
-Yeah.

51
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,300
If Daniels has a detail set up already,
maybe he takes the murders, too.

52
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,200
He ain't no fool, Jay.
He's just giving us a room with no view.

53
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,400
That was approval, right?
He gave approval to go ahead with this.

54
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,000
I don't know.

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
What's next?

56
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,200
Next is for us to get them dock boys
back to thinking that we've gone away.

57
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,800
I mean, we spooked them right good
with that grand jury shit.

58
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,400
If we're gonna set up on them,
they need to think...

59
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,300
we ain't gonna be a problem no more.

60
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,600
How are they gonna think that?

61
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,600
No, see, that ain't the way it works.

62
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,900
It ain't.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,700
'Cause I'm the one out here all day
taking the chance, right?

64
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,500
Police roll up into this bitch,
it ain't gonna be you that catch no charge.

65
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,900
So, least-wise, the thing you need to do...

66
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,300
is lay all that good shit
down on an even split.

67
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,200
Come Friday, me and my niggers
done sold all that shit off...

68
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,600
you come past and get paid.
That's how I'm at with it.

69
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,000
Hey, Frog.

70
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,800
Come here.

71
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,200
No, seriously. Come here.

72
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,200
First of all,
and I don't know how to tell you this...

73
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,400
without hurting you deeply...

74
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,700
first of all, you happen to be white.

75
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,300
I'm talking raised-on-Rapolla-Street white...

76
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,100
where your mama used to drag you down
to St. Casimir's...

77
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,600
just like all the other
little pisspants on the block.

78
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,400
Second, I'm also white.

79
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,000
Not hang-on-the-corner-
don't-give-a-fuck white...

80
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,600
but Locust-Point-l.B.S.-Local-47 white.

81
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't work without no fucking contract...

82
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,200
and I don't stand around
listening to horseshit excuses...

83
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,200
Iike my cousin Ziggy, who, by the way...

84
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,700
is still owed money by you
and all your down, street-wise whiggers.

85
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,100
You go in your pocket,
come up with $500 in advance...

86
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,700
and the $210 that you owe to Zig...

87
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
you can work my package.

88
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,200
This is the shit you had out here last week.
The dimes that Moochie was slinging?

89
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,700
The shit was good. Moochie sold out quick.

90
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,500
All right.

91
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,400
I'm saying, I'm gonna send
my man around with the dollars.

92
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,200
-Keep it real.
-Whatever.

93
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
-Everything to your satisfaction?
-Yeah, you on it.

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,800
Prison people taking it that
that boy hung his own self, right?

95
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,200
Seems so.

96
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,800
My cousin always works clean.

97
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,600
None of my business, I know...

98
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,600
but did your man Avon even know about it?

99
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
You're on your own here?

100
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,300
You're right. It ain't none of your business.

101
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,500
And if I were you...

102
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,300
I wouldn't want a word of this mess
up in Avon's ear.

103
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,100
Baltimore niggers off the hook. I swear.

104
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,100
All y'all.

105
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,900
You better get up in this before it get cold.
This shit is good.

106
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,900
My man, that bullshit ain't on you.
It ain't, man.

107
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,400
Up in here, D knew he had to stand
on his own. You know this.

108
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200
Man, fuck him.

109
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,900
He knew when he hung himself
how we was gonna carry it.

110
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,000
He knew when he did that, that we were
gonna be in a moment like this, right now.

111
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,400
He knew that.

112
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,800
That nigger did that shit to hurt me, man.

113
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,300
But, you know, man,
D was just fucking weak.

114
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,500
I tried to crimp him along
since he was a shorty, nigger.

115
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
I tried to bring him up, bring him along--

116
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,000
-You were real good to him.
-I was.

117
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,800
Man, it's sad, what happened.
That shit is sad.

118
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,700
But the boy almost
rolled on you that one time.

119
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,300
You know, he get to thinking
he can't do the years in here...

120
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,300
he might've could've rolled again.
Who knows?

121
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,300
I'm just saying...

122
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,000
it might've been for the best, you know?

123
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,200
His name is Head. Dick Head.

124
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,400
Check this out. Put your finger right there.

125
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,100
-Nice.
-Nice, right?

126
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,300
-Fellows.
-We need a bug.

127
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,700
Something that can stand up
to the pressures...

128
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,900
of the modern urban crime environment.

129
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,600
Let me show you.

130
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,100
Okay, fellows, this is the real deal.
Smaller than a 22.

131
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,700
And it's got a clear channel. Sturdy as hell.

132
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,400
You get this bad boy
within 10 feet of any conversation...

133
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,200
it sounds like Chuck Thompson
doing play-by-play.

134
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,300
-How much?
-$1,500.

135
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,700
But seeing as you're sworn officers,
the police discount drops it to $1,250.

136
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,000
-You in?
-Am I in?

137
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,500
The man just said $1,250, Herc.

138
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,600
Can we give it a test run?

139
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,000
A test drive in the modern
urban crime environment?

140
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Yeah, leave me your credit card
and take it for 48 hours.

141
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,200
Change your mind, bring it back.
No problem.

142
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,900
-Let me consult my partner.
-Of course.

143
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,600
You got a credit card?

144
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,600
-Don't you?
-It's maxed to the max, man.

145
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,600
We've been doing
hand-to-hands for a while now...

146
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,400
and we ain't no higher up
on the ladder and on those corners.

147
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,300
We're just gonna use it for a couple days,
get what we need, and bring it back.

148
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,400
I gave your man some room, that's all.

149
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,300
You gave him a home.

150
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,400
Det. Moreland's target
looks to be the same as yours.

151
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,900
-No.
-Yes.

152
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,000
You could take these 14 homicides...

153
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,800
and turn that half-assed detail
you got going into something that matters.

154
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,400
I'll be honest. You solve the murders,
I'll love you for the stats.

155
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,100
And if you don't,
I've made it so the Homicide Unit...

156
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,600
doesn't have to bear the whole brunt
of a lower clearance rate.

157
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,700
It's win-win for me.

158
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,100
-No.
-Come on, Lieutenant.

159
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,700
A good turn here will not be forgotten.

160
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,900
I'm trying to dig myself out of the basement
with something simple and clean here.

161
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,800
Drug arrests,
maybe a prostitution bust if I get lucky...

162
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,400
and I'm out from under with Burrell.

163
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,400
Sorry, Colonel.

164
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,600
You keep the murders,
and my ass stays covered.

165
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,100
Smarter than he looks.

166
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,300
-Where's your friend?
-Who's that?

167
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,100
-The black fellow, the Homicide guy.
-Case is done, for all I know.

168
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,600
Yeah?

169
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,800
You all didn't go for nothing,
and no one on the ship did either.

170
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,800
So, he sent me back
and moved on to new business.

171
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,900
-So you back to the usual then?
-Yeah, the usual.

172
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,000
Except I won't be around Patapsco
or North Point much.

173
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,200
Starting tomorrow,
I'm down at the Fairfield Terminals.

174
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,400
Fairfield?

175
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,600
Yeah, bosses want another car
patrolling the chemical plants.

176
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,900
Because of terrorism, I guess.

177
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,800
You're too pretty
for the Fairfield Piers, darling.

178
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,400
You need to be uptown here with us.

179
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,500
You got stripes in the Southeast...

180
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,000
and can't pull Valchek's spy van
to work his own detail?

181
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,400
Man, I've never seen that thing.

182
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,600
-Snug.
-As a bug.

183
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,700
In a rug.

184
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,200
Let's go.

185
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,500
-This shit is hypnotic.
-Boring, too.

186
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,300
You make a show of it?

187
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Let everyone working see me
in that radio car.

188
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,700
Is that the Valparaiso?

189
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,200
It ain't a Talco Line ship,
doesn't have Horseface working.

190
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,700
Probably wasting half a day
watching it offload.

191
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,400
-Yeah, we should be at the bar by now.
-Nothing's wasted.

192
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,700
I've been getting a feel for this shit.
How it plays and works without the dirt.

193
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,700
-So when they lose a can--
-I see it go.

194
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,900
Gentlemen. Ladies.

195
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,100
The future is now.

196
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,400
To bring goods
to an exploding global economy...

197
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,400
and to deliver those goods faster,
cheaper and safer...

198
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,200
modern robotics do much of the work
in the world's largest seaport, Rotterdam.

199
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,900
Moving cargo is a traditional
strength of the Dutch...

200
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,100
who shuttle more freight in fewer man-hours
than any port in the world.

201
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,700
And now, the Dutch have modeled
the future of cargo management.

202
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Completely containerized cargo
arrives and departs...

203
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,200
on ships a third of a mile long,
24 hours a day, with short turnaround.

204
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,200
Smart card technology
provides greater security...

205
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,900
and improved accountability, with no need
for unreliable human surveillance.

206
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Frog, man, we light five caps is all, man.

207
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm saying, you getting all ridiculous
over bits and pieces. You feeling me?

208
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
Nigger, it's the principle of the thing.

209
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,700
It's like you in a store working the register...

210
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,000
and at the end of the day,
the shitjust add up.

211
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,200
Mad Dog gonna roll through here tomorrow
with the re-up...

212
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,800
and I want to have the package
right for once.

213
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,600
Hey, Carver.

214
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,100
Isn't technology the fucking bomb?

215
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,800
...and global positioning systems
guide each container...

216
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,200
to its proper spot,
on board or on the docks...

217
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,400
while state-of-the-art-computers
track shipments in every part--

218
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,400
Some of the systems you're seeing
have already been upgraded.

219
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,700
Rotterdam now works
350 million tons of cargo annually...

220
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,600
Ieaving Singapore a distant second.

221
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,700
What kind of man-hours
are the stevedores clocking over there?

222
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,000
I don't have those figures handy. I'm sorry.

223
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,700
But Rotterdam does employ 4,000 people.

224
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,700
4,000 people to move
350 million tons a year?

225
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,100
-That's right.
-That's efficiency, Nat.

226
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,600
By eliminating
some of the more dangerous work...

227
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,100
the Rotterdam technologies have reduced...

228
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,100
employee work-related accidents
and injuries by 60%.

229
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,800
I think we can all be happy
with that, can't we?

230
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Question? Yes?

231
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,000
The GPS readings, are they exact....

232
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,600
You can't get hurt
if you ain't working, right?

233
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,800
No, they work with all kinds of cargo,
in all kinds of weather.

234
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,200
Coming.

235
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,800
-Hey, Jackie.
-String. You, too?

236
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,300
We got enough food
for three weeks right now.

237
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,200
How's Brianna? ls she back there?

238
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,000
What's up, little man?

239
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,200
How you holding up?

240
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Bri.

241
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,500
-Nicky boy, you get days this week?
-No.

242
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,400
Four ships on Thursday.
You could've pulled a day for sure.

243
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,600
That's your half on the last two packages,
plus what Frog owed you on your own shit.

244
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,100
It's all there, cuz.

245
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,700
-What the fuck is wrong with you, smiley?
-Nothing.

246
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,700
What did Frog say?

247
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,700
"Here's a couple of hundred extra,
make the little goof happy"?

248
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,100
The packages were my thing, Nick.

249
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,700
Fuck, if you ain't handle
that business better, too.

250
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,400
Zig, we're making money.

251
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,600
It's your move, Nicky.

252
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,600
Fuck it. I got other issues right now.

253
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,500
Paternity?

254
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,400
Priscilla Katlow.

255
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,500
Jesus, Zig. You knocked up Prissy Katlow?

256
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,000
I only fucked her once.

257
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,700
Christ, everybody down the point
fucked her the once.

258
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,400
How do you know it's yours?

259
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,000
You call this lawyer?

260
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,900
Figured I'd get drunk first.

261
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,200
That's a good plan.

262
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,100
-Russians?
-Lot of girls. Pretty ones.

263
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,400
Most of them had
some kind of accent anyway.

264
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,100
Shardene's friend hooked us up good.
Who's in charge?

265
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,600
You got the club people, I guess.

266
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,400
And there's some woman
I've seen go into the back room.

267
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,000
She looks a little bit older.

268
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,500
I couldn't get close enough
to say much about her.

269
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,400
She looks about 40.

270
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,900
Grab any ass, Prez?

271
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,900
What I'm saying is, I've sorted it out for us.

272
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,100
-I have.
-For us?

273
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,400
When I was in the basement,
it made sense to quit. It did.

274
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,200
But once Burrell reached out--

275
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,100
But Burrell is the one that you crossed.
He's not likely to forget that, is he?

276
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,400
Not to mention what he knows
about you from the bad old days.

277
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,000
Fools half your age
are gonna be Major and Colonel...

278
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,400
and you'll still think that
scratching out a case or two will save you.

279
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,300
It isn't about the casework, I know that.

280
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,900
Just today, Rawls calls me up to CID...

281
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,900
asks me to take his homicides from
the dead girls on that shipping container.

282
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,100
I told him, no shot. That case is a loser.

283
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,200
If I'm looking out for number one...

284
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,800
I'm gonna bring Burrell
exactly what he asked for...

285
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,100
and exactly what he needs
to make Stan Valchek go away.

286
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,300
No more, no less.
I'm playing their game this time.

287
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,100
Look, it's one thing you taking a run
at this dredging thing.

288
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,500
Fucked-up as you are,
we can let that slide for a while...

289
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,700
but now, you're asking too much.

290
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,200
One more year, Nat.

291
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,500
-Not for me, for the fucking union.
-The election's been scheduled.

292
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,000
You knew last year,
when we gave you the votes...

293
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,700
that this time would be Ott's turn.
You knew that.

294
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,800
So Ott runs next time.
He'll take that year and the next.

295
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,700
It's our turn, Frank.

296
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,000
Black, White, what's the difference, Nat?

297
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,700
Until we get that fucking canal dredged,
we're all niggers, pardon my French.

298
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Or Polacks, pardon mine.

299
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,700
You know what I'm saying,
this ain't about Ott.

300
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,400
I just want one more year
to finish what I started here.

301
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Then Ott stays Secretary-Treasurer
for the next two, no problem.

302
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,700
Think about it.

303
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,200
-Hello?
-Brucie, baby.

304
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,000
-Frankie Sobotka, how's it hanging?
-You talk to the presiding officers yet?

305
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,800
Lot of girls. Lot of muscle.

306
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,500
Zig, Jesus, get off me, you jerk.

307
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,900
-When did you get served with these?
-I got them in the mail this morning.

308
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,500
-In the mail?
-Yeah, this morning.

309
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,400
When Pokey Barber got hit with paternity...

310
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,300
a sheriff had to come to his house
and serve him with papers.

311
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,700
Dolores, can I use the bar phone?

312
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,000
-Who are you calling?
-The lawyer on this piece of bullshit.

313
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,700
What? Ain't no fucking law firm open
in the middle of the goddamn night.

314
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,000
Shyster, Shyster and Shyster.

315
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,500
-He got you, Zig.
-Who got me?

316
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,000
Maui?

317
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,900
Love child, never meant to be

318
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,500
Love child, born in poverty

319
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,700
Love child, never meant to be

320
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,000
There's no restroom in the lobby,
and if you're not an approved visitor...

321
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,600
I just don't have the authorization.

322
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,100
Okay.

323
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,300
Tell me something.
When you have to go, where do you go?

324
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,100
Excuse me, sir? Are you a resident?

325
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,400
Sorry. Wrong building.

326
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Sixth floor, all of them.

327
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,100
Thomas "Horseface" Pakusa.

328
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,900
Slated to be the ship-runner
on Talco Line's Esmeralda.

329
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,100
ETA, noon tomorrow,
Berth 6, Patapsco Terminal.

330
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,300
-So we're on.
-We're gonna need help with surveillance.

331
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,500
On the docks especially,
since our faces are known down there.

332
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,300
I can reach out to Greggs and Prez, maybe.
Bring them in on it.

333
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,600
Should we tell the Lieutenant?

334
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,500
Right now, the less he knows
he's involved in the murder investigation...

335
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,500
the happier he'll feel.

336
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,100
New truck?

337
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What the fuck,
we're making money here, right?

338
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,900
-Hell, yeah.
-For real.

339
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,700
This guy's some kind of supplier.
Snap some shots of the truck tags.

340
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,800
-You got more for me?
-I got ifyou got for me, right?

341
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:25,400
Got to say, your thing is tight.
Best around here in a long while.

342
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Fuck!

343
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,300
I'm with you on this, man....

344
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,400
All right, dawg.

345
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,800
Come on, asshole,
what the fuck's wrong with you?

346
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,800
Keep it fucking moving.

347
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,300
Jesus Christ!

348
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,500
No!

349
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,100
I cleared it with KGA,
we'll be working off of Channel 6.

350
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,200
I cleared it with KGA,
we'll be working off of Channel 6.

351
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,600
Prez, you got the eyeball
on the outbound truck gate.

352
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,300
Need you to set up so you can move
in either direction on Broening Highway.

353
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,900
Bunk, you set up on Newkirk and Broening.

354
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,100
Me and Russell will be on the computer.
That leaves the terminal itself to Kima.

355
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,900
They might not know my face,
but I sure as shit can't hang down there.

356
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,400
I'm thinking I should borrow
that CG&E truck from Narcotics.

357
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,300
Slap on a hard hat, pick up a clipboard.

358
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,400
What if they're not sneaking anything off
this time? What then?

359
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,400
Tragically, you will have wasted another day
in a life you've already misspent...

360
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,500
in the service of the city of Baltimore.

361
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,300
-Nothing's alive in these, right?
-If they don't go hot to a truck...

362
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,400
you go back in the stacks
and bang on them to make sure.

363
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,800
I trust these Greek fucks with nothing.

364
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,700
-How you hanging?
-Good. I'm good.

365
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,400
You ain't been working much.

366
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,600
Stay close, Nick.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

367
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Jesus on the main line

368
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,300
Tell him what you want

369
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,500
Oh, Jesus on the main line

370
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,700
Tell him what you want

371
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,300
Jesus on the main line

372
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Tell him what you want

373
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,500
Call him up and tell him what you want

374
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,800
Ifyou want salvation

375
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,500
Tell him what you want

376
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Oh, ifyou want salvation

377
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,800
Tell him what you want

378
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,200
Ifyou want salvation

379
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,300
Tell him what you want

380
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,000
Call him up and tell him what you want

381
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,300
Oh, call him up, call him up

382
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,900
Tell him what you want

383
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Oh, call him up, call him up

384
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,200
Tell him what you want

385
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,700
Call him up, call him up

386
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,700
Tell him what you want

387
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,900
Jesus on the main line

388
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,500
You did the 221?

389
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,900
Shit look tight.

390
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,500
Sorry for the loss.

391
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,900
You all sent him off right, though.

392
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,400
As good a homecoming as I been to.

393
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,700
-You been to your share, man, I know.
-No doubt.

394
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,900
Of course, this is neither the time
nor the place...

395
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,900
but I thought I might
get at you for a moment.

396
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,400
-Got a proposition here.
-Go ahead to the car, man.

397
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,900
Ain't exactly talking out of turn when I say...

398
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,700
that, uh, Westside dope
been weak for a while now.

399
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,700
Every dope fiend in the city knows that
Avon been putting out piss, calling it shit.

400
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,300
The thing is, y'all sitting on
some of the best real estate in the city.

401
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,000
The Terrace, the low-rises,
the avenue corners.

402
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,600
Respecting the fact that you're known
to have a way with your words...

403
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,400
when are you gonna tell me
something I don't know?

404
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,300
Let me put a point on it.
My shit is right, String.

405
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,400
I got dope coming straight into Baltimore,
and the shit is raw.

406
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,200
85, 90%. And you know it's true.

407
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,400
You got half the Westside coming over
to Fallsway twice a day...

408
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,900
because Eastside dope be kicking the shit
out of Westside dope.

409
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,300
-You connected?
-This shit is straight off the damn boat.

410
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,100
I ain't even going to New York
except for my coke. Ain't no need.

411
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,000
Thing is, y'all got the best territory,
and no kind of product.

412
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,500
I got the best product,
but could stand a little more territory...

413
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
so you see where this thing needs to go.

414
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,000
Now you know Avon fought real hard
for them Towers.

415
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,700
We took down the Rayford brothers,
Big Dennis Woodson, I mean--

416
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,000
This shit is just business, String.
Buy for a dollar, sell for two.

417
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,900
That's all it need be. You got the Towers,
I got what goes in them.

418
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,100
Later for all that bullshit.

419
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,000
-I'll talk to Avon.
-You do that.

420
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Come on, I can read a budget summary.
There's nothing in there for dredging.

421
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,700
Shortfall in revenues.
The governor's looking to limit bond issues.

422
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,000
-But the grain pier is still in there.
-And the rest is just talk?

423
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,200
Talk is good, Frank. Talk is a start.

424
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,900
Talk is your fucking job description.

425
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,600
Yak. Yak. Yak. Blah. Blah. Blah.

426
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,300
That's like saying all the checkers do
is punch numbers into a computer.

427
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,900
Your son, the oldest one,
he goes to what school?

428
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,700
-Jason's at Princeton.
-Princeton.

429
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,400
And after he graduates,
he's gonna do what?

430
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
-Whatever he wants.
-Right.

431
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,900
You sent him to Princeton
to do whatever the fuck he wants.

432
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,000
You know, back when we were kids...

433
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,200
Danny Hare's father stole
a couple cases of cognac off a ship.

434
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,800
Except when he gets it home,
it ain't cognac, it's Tang.

435
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,700
-Tang?
-Just invented.

436
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,600
TV said it's what the astronauts drank
on their way to the moon.

437
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,000
-You drink it....
-You could be an astronaut, too.

438
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,600
All summer long,
that shit was all the Hare kids drank.

439
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,200
Tang with breakfast, Tang with lunch...

440
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,600
Tang when they woke up scared
in the middle of the night.

441
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,300
What do you think they grew up to be?

442
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,700
Stevedores. What the fuck you think?

443
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,900
Something tells me
Jason DiBiago will grow up...

444
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,800
and squeeze a buck
the way his old man did.

445
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,300
You're out of line, Frank.

446
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,500
My great-grandfather was a knife sharpener.

447
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,100
Pushed a grinding stone up
Preston Street to Alice-Ann...

448
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,800
one leg shorter than the other
from pumping the wheel.

449
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,700
Since he didn't want his sons
to push the goddamn thing...

450
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,300
he made sure my grandfather
finished high school...

451
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,100
and my old man went to any college
that would take him.

452
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,000
You're talking history, right?

453
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,400
I'm talking now.

454
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,600
Down here, it's still: "Who's your old man?"
'til you got kids of your own.

455
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,800
Then it's, "Who's your son?"

456
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,400
But after the horror movie I've seen today....
Robots!

457
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,500
Piers full of robots!

458
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,400
My kid will be lucky if he's
punching numbers five years from now.

459
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,700
While it don't mean shit that I can't take
my steak knives to DiBiago and sons...

460
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,400
it breaks my heart that there's no future
for the Sobotkas on the waterfront.

461
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,200
Here, Brucie. I think they're your size.

462
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,400
I'm operating under the assumption that
because of your relentless diligence...

463
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,100
the funding for the grain pier
is gonna pass the assembly.

464
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,800
But I'm also talking about the canal.
So you're gonna talk about the canal...

465
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,000
the Muldoons who run the old line state
are gonna talk about it...

466
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,000
until some day, some way,
that motherfucker gets dredged...

467
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,300
and we get some ships in here.

468
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,700
Bring it down!

469
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,000
-Got one that disappeared.
-Get the container number?

470
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,100
-1 1-37 to 1 2-14.
-Go ahead, Lester.

471
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,200
-We got one, you prepared to copy?
-Send it.

472
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,500
Zulu, Tango, Golf, Romeo...

473
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,800
9, 7, 3, 2, 6, 5, check digit 9.

474
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,900
Copy that, I've got it in the yard.

475
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,600
-1 1-99.
-11-99.

476
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,400
We got a live one. Be up.

477
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,100
-What am I looking for?
-Stand by on that.

478
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,500
Be advised, I've got a White male,
orange safety vest...

479
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,100
blue overalls.

480
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,700
He's hooking the truck onto the....
What do you call it?

481
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,100
Copy that. What next?

482
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,700
One of two things.
The driver takes it through checkout...

483
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,400
in which case it may be that Horseface
entered the wrong container number...

484
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,200
and they find it there.
Or it goes out to Bobtail Lane.

485
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,900
If it does that, they're doing the dirt.

486
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
1 1-37 to 1 2-14.

487
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,800
Kima, keep the eyeball
until it clears the yard.

488
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,100
Advise if it stops at the checkout point,
or goes straight out.

489
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,300
Copy.

490
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,500
1 2-14. He went around the checkout. Copy.

491
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,500
-11-37 to 11-99.
-99.

492
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,500
Target's coming at you, you see it?

493
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,800
I got him on Broening,
heading west towards the city.

494
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,100
Copy, 11-37 to 11-34.

495
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,500
-Target approaching your 20.
-1 1-34, copy that.

496
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,500
I got him going straight on Newkirk.

497
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,200
-He's all yours, Bunk.
-Copy.

498
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,900
-1 1-34, you got the eyeball.
-Copy.

499
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,300
-1 1-34.
-Go ahead, 34.

500
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,300
He went to ground off of Newkirk.
Some kind of warehouse.

501
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,500
Wait one. I'll swing back, get a 20.

502
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,700
Be advised, it is a warehouse.

503
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,600
Pyramid lnc. 5605 Newkirk.

504
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,300
Copy that.

505
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,800
Brianna, man, she putting it on you?

506
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,900
Avon, you knew he was using?

507
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,300
I seen it, but I didn't see it.

508
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,000
I mean, he came up off that shit...

509
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,500
then we did our thing with the guard,
and I thought....

510
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,500
Fuck.

511
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,500
We did our thing with the homegoing, man.
I mean, it came off nice.

512
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,200
-Yeah?
-Yeah, everybody showed.

513
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,800
-How did Brianna do?
-Rough.

514
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,500
Don't nobody want shit like this
to happen, man.

515
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,600
If I'd have known the boy was
gonna be doing shit like that...

516
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,800
-you know what I mean?
-What are the prison people saying?

517
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,400
That he just hung himself like that?

518
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,200
Just tied a rope around a knob,
and sat his ass down.

519
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,800
How the fuck you gonna stop a man
from doing some shit like that?

520
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,800
What are you gonna do?

521
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,400
Stay with him every damn minute,
every day you can?

522
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,200
He gonna find a way if he wants to.

523
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,500
It ain't on you.

524
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,100
It ain't on you. I would tell you if it was.

525
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,400
What's up with that other thing, man?

526
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Still shit, man. Your man in Atlanta
don't know what raw is.

527
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,200
-We gonna discount it.
-Do I look like Kmart to you, man?

528
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,400
-I'm saying, I mean--
-What are you saying? That's ridiculous.

529
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,700
Re-package it and sell it off.

530
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,100
You know, Proposition Joe
came to the funeral.

531
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,000
Pulled me aside. He's got a smoker.
Everybody knows he's got a smoker...

532
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,800
and he wants to share,
if we cut him a slice of the Towers.

533
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,000
-You know, it's a thought--
-It's not even a thought, man. No.

534
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,800
Let me tell you something. We're gonna
get through all this, you hear me?

535
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,100
-I know.
-All of it.

536
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,300
Anything come out?

537
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,600
If there were girls in that can,
they're still inside.

538
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,200
-Your DNRs go where?
-Phones for dockworkers local.

539
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,400
Offices, personal phones
for a couple of union officials.

540
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,200
Look here, 9581737
is listed to Thomas Pakusa.

541
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,200
On February 4th, and March 16th...

542
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,800
our Mr. Pakusa received a call
from Frank Sobotka's cell phone.

543
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,900
And both times, he works
a Talco Line ship the next day.

544
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,600
And both times,
a can goes missing in the computer.

545
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,900
Pretty good argument for a conspiracy case.

546
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,700
-Conspiracy to do what?
-Smuggle shit.

547
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,400
Smuggle what?

548
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,900
For starters, how about bringing girls
here for purposes of prostitution?

549
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,900
-That one we know about.
-You need to do better for a wiretap.

550
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,900
Read your annotated code.
Wiretap Statute, Subsection 10, 406...

551
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,400
designates crimes where telephonic
communication can be intercepted...

552
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,500
in the great state of Maryland. Prostitution?

553
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,500
You mean, you can tap a guy's phone
if he's selling drugs...

554
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,900
but if he's selling women,
he's out of bounds?

555
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,400
That's the law.

556
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,000
Honey, I'm home.

557
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,800
Start looking at the two-bedroom joints.

558
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,300
-We can pay.
-How?

559
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
-Got a new job.
-Off the docks?

560
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,700
Three, four days a week.
Warehouse foreman for this Greek guy.

561
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,800
He owns an appliance store
down the avenue in Highland Town.

562
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,600
I can work it around the hours
that I pick up at the docks.

563
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,200
How much, Nick?

564
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,500
Come here.

565
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,600
Like $500 a week. Maybe more.

566
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,900
But steady. You know, we can count on it.

567
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,300
Between what you make
with them scissors and this...

568
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,400
we can pay down the truck
and still have enough left over...

569
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,100
for someplace nice out in the county.

570
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,300
$1,500.

571
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,100
$1,250, with the police discount.

572
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,200
It just couldn't stand up to
the modern urban crime environment.

573
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,800
All right, slow up. This is it.

574
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,200
It's listed to Nicholas Andrew Sobotka,
1485 Reynold Street.

575
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,500
-Sobotka?
-That's what it says here.

576
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,200
That mean anything to you?

577
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,300
Beavis, that's the name of the guy
we're supposed to be working.

578
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,900
Frank Sobotka.

579
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,100
But we got Nicholas.

580
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,500
How many fucking Sobotkas can there be,
even down here in Polack town?

581
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,900
-You know what this means?
-What?

582
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,700
It means old fuzzy Dunlop here
is somewhat worse for wear, I admit...

583
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,300
it's really gonna start paying off
as a confidential informant.

584
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,400
-No fucking way.
-Are you out $1,250?

585
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,300
Because linking a street-level drug connect
to our main target...

586
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,700
has to be worth $200 for starters.

587
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,300
Listen, if I try to register him,
Daniels will smell a rat.

588
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,600
He trusts you, Carv.
You got that trustworthy look.

589
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,600
It's you, Lester. Got to be you.

590
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,700
-Me?
-We need to bring in the Lieutenant...

591
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,100
his detail and all the manpower
and toys that go with it.

592
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,800
And Daniels listens when you talk.

593
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,800
You got the smell of wisdom
on you, brother.

594
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,200
-We all got roles to play.
-What's your role?

595
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,300
I'm just a humble motherfucker
with a big-ass dick.

596
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,600
You give yourself too much credit.

597
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,500
Okay, then. I ain't all that humble.

598
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,900
I'll be goddamned.

599
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:14,100
I swear to God, if he plays
that goddamn song one more time...

600
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,100
I'm gonna clock his ass good.

601
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,800
You can take him, Zig. He just looks big.

602
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,500
Who the fuck is he? All pussy.

603
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,400
You're a legend of the docks, Zig.
A fucking legend.

604
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,600
You think I can take him?

605
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,000
You can take him.

606
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,000
-Man down, berth five.
-Who?

607
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,500
New Charles.

608
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,200
-Ambo's on the way.
-Jesus Christ.

609
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,700
Night work with break-bulk. I hate this shit.

610
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,600
-You guys gonna move this thing or what?
-Jesus. Fuck.

611
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,600
Ain't supposed to move a guy
when he's hurt.

612
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,900
We'll remember that
when you hit the number.

613
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,200
Quit pulling your dicks
and get this thing off of me.

614
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,900
One, two, three.

615
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,500
Charlie, here. Take a drag.

616
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,200
That's the ambo you're hearing, Charlie.

617
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,500
Right over there.

618
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,800
Don't worry, kid, you're still on the clock.

619
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,800
Frank, how does the leg look?

620
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,900
-Which leg is that now?
-Sir, can you hear my voice?

621
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,000
Squeeze my hand.

622
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,300
Let's get him into the ambulance.

623
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,900
You need to clear the way for us, guys.

624
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,700
-And you followed the can?
-Right to the warehouse.

625
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,900
-Surveillance set up?
-Kima is on it tonight.

626
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,500
This case needs to be worked, Lieutenant.

627
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,000
I know it began for you as a bullshit detail...

628
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,500
but this Sobotka's into some shit
that needs to be worked by good police.

629
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:14,400
The DNRs, the cloned computer.
We've got the pattern.

630
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,000
Rawls came to me.

631
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,900
-Asked if I would take the homicides.
-You should.

632
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,900
Those girls in the can really suffocated.
They really died in that fucking box.

633
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,400
You pick this case up,
you might eat those open murders.

634
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,400
But you let it pass...

635
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,500
you got to ask yourself
how you want to live your day-to-day.

636
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,200
you got to ask yourself
how you want to live your day-to-day.

637
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,500
From the guys in 15-14.

638
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,300
He should be all right.

639
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,200
You know how he got the name
New Charles?

640
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,800
First day of work was the same day...

641
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,200
the Paceco dropped a hatch cover
on Charlie Bannion.

642
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,200
Had to clean up old Charlie with a shovel.

643
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,800
Ever since then, New Charles.

644
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,200
He's gonna lose the leg.

645
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,200
Where's the money from?

646
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:22,300
I got your murders.
But what I need from you, I get.

647
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,000
No bullshit, no arguments.

648
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,000
No arguments.

649
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,000
-You're wasting all the batteries.
-So?

650
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,600
Mom, he's wasting all the batteries.

651
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:50,400
You two get along
or I'm gonna take that tent down right now.

652
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,000
-Snitch.
-Punk.

653
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,000
-Squirrel.
-Mope.

654
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,600
-Shut up.
-Who teaches them this stuff?

655
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,800
It's my turn, you just had it.

656
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,500
Elena.

657
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,500
No.

658
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,200
I don't trust you.

659
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,500
I can care about you...

660
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,900
and I can want us to be friends...

661
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,000
and if you give me enough time, Jimmy...

662
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,100
maybe I will actually want you to be happy.

663
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,700
But how the hell
am I supposed to trust you?

664
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,100
Mom, quick, it's a spider.

665
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,300
It's a big, hairy one.

666
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,600
-Oh, my gosh.
-Come on, Mom.

667
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:09,800
But if the case does come together,
I would at least have Rawls as a rabbi.

668
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,200
It could still work for me.

669
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,500
Listen to yourself.

670
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,200
I love the job, Marla.

671
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,000
-I can't help it.
-The job doesn't love you.

672
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,300
You know what I love?

673
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,700
The mind that's always a step ahead of me...

674
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,400
the person who never stops
thinking it through.

675
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,100
That's what I fell in love with first.

676
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,400
Do you know what I fell in love with first?
Do you?

677
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,700
Your ambition.

678
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,800
Where did that man go?

679
00:56:50,305 --> 00:57:50,498

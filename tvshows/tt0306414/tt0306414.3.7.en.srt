2
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,116
All quiet today ?

3
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:25,889
Keepin' it like that, boss.

4
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,128
We rule where we stand.

5
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,317
Police sittin' on all
the corners over these parts.

6
00:00:38,577 --> 00:00:40,560
Likely because
we been droppin' bodies.

7
00:00:41,178 --> 00:00:42,257
Yeah, they do like that.

8
00:00:42,773 --> 00:00:45,247
But you know tomorrow
some other nigger stop a bullet

9
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:47,703
somewhere else and then they
go stand on a new spot.

10
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:49,638
Boy Marlo closed up shop.

11
00:00:50,705 --> 00:00:53,748
Word is he wholesaling
his packages for now.

12
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:56,692
He ain't got no crews
out here at all ?

13
00:00:57,162 --> 00:00:58,779
How 'bout his avenue corners ?

14
00:01:00,188 --> 00:01:01,891
Nigger give up quick, didn't he ?

15
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:06,795
Damn, I was just beginnin' to respect
the little motherfucker for showin' heart.

16
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:08,249
A-ight, listen.

17
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:11,451
When the police roll out,
y'all step in there an' take my corners.

18
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:12,436
I'm on it, B.

19
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:15,020
Cheesesteaks from Bill's.

20
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,165
Nah, I did that tuesday, man.

21
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:18,941
Fuck it then, you pick.

22
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:31,003
Naw, fuck me.

23
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:32,340
What ?

24
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:34,009
Mope in the truck.

25
00:01:34,747 --> 00:01:35,580
What about him ?

26
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:36,894
I think I locked him up.

27
00:01:38,137 --> 00:01:39,369
Avon whatshisface.

28
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:41,328
Big player from the projects.

29
00:01:41,996 --> 00:01:44,795
He was the target on that detail
I worked a couple years back

30
00:01:44,877 --> 00:01:46,261
the one I told you about.

31
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:52,446
Motherfucker's out already.

32
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,426
Why, what'd he pull ?

33
00:01:54,473 --> 00:01:56,936
Six, eight years.
Who the fuck can remember ?

34
00:01:57,592 --> 00:01:58,929
An' he's out in two ?

35
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:02,155
Maybe I got the years wrong.

36
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:05,919
Point is guy's an asshole.
Locked him up is all.

37
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,731
Pit beef, from the market.

38
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,749
See ? Now you thinkin' like police.

39
00:03:42,898 --> 00:03:44,427
Back Burners

40
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:50,352
Change in plan.

41
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:53,873
Bell you recognize.

42
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:58,178
Second target is a Marlo Stanfield

43
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:01,156
who is apparently warring
with Bell for Westside corners.

44
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,895
What about Kintel Williamson ?

45
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:04,796
That case is on hold for now.

46
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,921
On hold ?

47
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:09,490
We just managed to I.D. the cell
phones on two of his people.

48
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:10,601
Be that as it may...

49
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,985
why not take
a few more weeks

50
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:14,519
and we can put together what
we got on Kintel, you know ?

51
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,802
We send the case to grand jury
and then we start up this Westside case.

52
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:19,762
Otherwise, we wasted
more than two months...

53
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,837
change of target comes to us from
the Commissioner and the Deputy Ops.

54
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:24,410
The department is
in a reactive mode

55
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,920
trying to get the murder rate down
by any means necessary.

56
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:29,383
Kintel was dropping bodies
two months ago.

57
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:32,691
Today, it's the Westside
that's got the bosses spinning.

58
00:04:32,863 --> 00:04:35,995
Look, I know y'all thought
it was nothin' for me to sit on that roof

59
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:39,505
day after 90-degree day,
dodgin' swarms of cicadas

60
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:41,381
and shit, but damn.
This is fucked up.

61
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:44,193
And all the assets
work I did on Kintel.

62
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:46,092
His cars, his cash flow...

63
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,695
I just put that in a drawer ?

64
00:04:56,906 --> 00:05:00,132
Some day I wanna work
for a real police department.

65
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:03,005
Just to see how the fuck
they do it, you know ?

66
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:07,967
McNulty.

67
00:05:09,462 --> 00:05:10,283
In my office.

68
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,675
Hey, Prez, can you
run something out for me ?

69
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,367
What ?

70
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,724
I need to know
who reed this room

71
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:25,886
in the downtown Hilton,
thursday before last.

72
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,089
Who rented the room ?

73
00:05:27,897 --> 00:05:30,360
Address, credit card details,
whatever you can pull.

74
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,624
How's it fit with the case ?

75
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:35,463
Hard to say just yet.

76
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:39,556
Hey, my man.

77
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:40,685
I'm done mowin'.

78
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:46,657
So I figured I'd use this
to edge the weeds around the fence.

79
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,553
- It's gas-powered.
- Means I got to prime it.

80
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:51,982
You ain't got  school me but once.

81
00:05:52,638 --> 00:05:54,897
Get some water
before you go back out there.

82
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:59,194
You been goin' hard at it.

83
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:02,137
You keep showin' up at the spot,
I'll keep puttin' you on.

84
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,459
Good, 'cause I ain't
got nothin' else.

85
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:08,468
You walked back through
them old doors, didn't you ?

86
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:10,956
Tried to.

87
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:13,832
I took you for gone.

88
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:18,941
Man, parole officers,
employment agencies...

89
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:22,941
shit, I just felt like I was
an interruption to their lunch break.

90
00:06:23,446 --> 00:06:24,255
No family ?

91
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,834
None besides my grandmother.

92
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:29,969
She put me up in the basement.

93
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:32,867
That's plenty to ask
of the old girl right there.

94
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,360
You could use someone to talk
to 'sides your grandmoms.

95
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,741
What about one of them
social worker types ?

96
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:39,973
I hooked up with one dude.

97
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,105
He was cool, but I wasn't ready.

98
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:46,579
You look like you ready now.

99
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:50,268
I mean, you found an ear to bend,
you wouldn't have to talk to me.

100
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,400
Shit, I know you gonna get tired
of lookin' at my ugly-ass grill.

101
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:57,504
Drink that too fast,
you'll cramp up.

102
00:07:03,311 --> 00:07:04,833
- You're asking ?
- I am.

103
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:07,090
Lieutenant, I didn't...

104
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,907
Because I got no problem
changing targets

105
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:10,756
if that's what the bosses
tell me to do.

106
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:12,869
Unless it's personal.

107
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:14,687
Like when Kima got shot...

108
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:17,497
I don't care where
we spend our time and money.

109
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:21,121
Bell, Williamson, whoever.
It's all just police work to me.

110
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:24,066
And I understand that people
above my pay-grade have the right

111
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:25,825
to make decisions
that are theirs to make.

112
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:26,764
And if they're wrong ?

113
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:28,999
Then they're wrong
and time will tell, won't it ?

114
00:07:30,312 --> 00:07:32,247
Now, I'm asking you for the truth.

115
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:35,555
You went to Colvin. Behind my back.

116
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,325
I'da gone to the devil himself.

117
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:39,519
Which way you were standing,
Lieutenant

118
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,208
had not a fucking
thing to do with it.

119
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:42,588
You piece of shit.

120
00:07:44,326 --> 00:07:45,946
I did it because it had to be done

121
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:48,345
just like it had to be
done two years ago

122
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:49,704
when we were first detailed.

123
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,985
Stringer was the target then,
he's still the target now.

124
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,154
Lieutenant, you know,
as bosses go

125
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:01,615
you're better than most

126
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:05,486
and I know you went out of your
way to get me off that boat.

127
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:07,010
I know that.

128
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:09,990
But now we're back
on the right man.

129
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:27,358
Detective McNulty.

130
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:32,921
When the cuffs go on Stringer,
you need to find a new home.

131
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,571
You're done in this unit.

132
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:49,614
Count right ?

133
00:08:49,683 --> 00:08:52,006
Yeah, went almost to Richmond
for this here batch.

134
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:53,413
Yeah, I'm holdin'...

135
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:56,309
- You did like we say, right ?
- Yeah.

136
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,423
Give him that.

137
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,776
We're gonna need another
60 more in a couple days.

138
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:02,598
60 more ?!

139
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:04,969
You know how we do.
So don't be cryin', Bernard.

140
00:09:14,616 --> 00:09:16,060
You musta left something out.

141
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:19,206
Fuck no. I got the part ones
from every sector, every post.

142
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:20,554
We're down about two percent.

143
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:22,511
Now where exactly are we down ?

144
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:24,398
Larcenies and burglaries are steady

145
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,944
but shootings and agg
assaults are both down.

146
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:29,982
Drug arrests, too, but I guess
that won't look so good.

147
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:32,736
I mean, where geographically
are we down ?

148
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:34,016
In the district ?

149
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,632
Well, the posts near the
designated drug zones are up

150
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,297
almost all of them.

151
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:41,814
That ain't pretty.
But everywhere else is down.

152
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:43,971
In some places
as much as four percent.

153
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:47,902
Bosses are gonna love you.

154
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,875
It's too soon to take any credit.

155
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:53,054
This might be, whatcha call that

156
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:54,403
statistical aberration.

157
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:56,580
You ain't gonna let them know

158
00:09:56,592 --> 00:09:58,551
that your little experiment
might be working ?

159
00:09:58,562 --> 00:09:59,489
Not yet, no.

160
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:02,620
But I'll tell you
what we are gonna do:

161
00:10:02,642 --> 00:10:03,722
Starting next week

162
00:10:03,863 --> 00:10:05,822
I want you to pull one car
out of service on

163
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:08,544
the quiet posts in every sector,
all three shifts.

164
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:10,761
We'll take those nine guys

165
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:13,349
gonna use 'em and double up
on the high-crime posts.

166
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,728
If we handle less of it

167
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,850
we ought to do better with
the crime we've got, right ?

168
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,359
Can I get two
Trac disposable phones.

169
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:29,221
They on special. Four for 180 ?

170
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:30,147
Just the two.

171
00:10:40,696 --> 00:10:42,895
Last show out at Westview is 8:45.

172
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,687
We could make that if we don't
make the whole damn run today.

173
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:48,840
Seem to me one phone
is as good as the next.

174
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:52,020
Only a fool drive all over the
world when there ain't no need.

175
00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:54,834
Keep on with that shit an' I'ma
leave your ass in Baltimore.

176
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:57,086
I don't trust no man
on the road by hisself, okay ?

177
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,154
I'm not stupid.

178
00:11:04,323 --> 00:11:05,226
Stupid ass fucker.

179
00:11:05,895 --> 00:11:06,611
Commissioner !

180
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:09,800
How goes it ?

181
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:13,494
It went a lot better before
the Mayor's cabinet meeting

182
00:11:13,518 --> 00:11:14,479
I can tell you that.

183
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:15,371
He rip you ?

184
00:11:16,205 --> 00:11:19,924
Says we need to finish under 300
for this year regardless of how it happens.

185
00:11:20,677 --> 00:11:22,643
- I tried to tell...
- Erv, lemme ask you...

186
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,983
where do you guys stand on this
witness assistance thing ?

187
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:29,710
What ?

188
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:32,944
Overhauling the city's
witness assistance program ?

189
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:37,286
Nobody from the Mayor's office
called you regarding

190
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:39,141
this problem of witnesses
getting killed ?

191
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:42,835
I got a call from the chief
of staff a week ago, yeah.

192
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,201
But all he said was
I should try not to have

193
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:46,608
any more witnesses get killed.

194
00:11:47,243 --> 00:11:48,696
But overhauling the program ?

195
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:51,221
Unless someone wants
to spend a lot more money

196
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:53,424
there's not a whole
helluva lot my people can do.

197
00:11:53,494 --> 00:11:55,841
And you haven't talked
to the Mayor directly on this ?

198
00:11:57,921 --> 00:11:59,528
You're not gonna fuck me on this ?

199
00:11:59,798 --> 00:12:02,178
As it is, I got
the Mayor's teeth in my ass.

200
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:03,845
Your name does not get mentioned.

201
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:08,328
Mayor didn't say a word to me.

202
00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:11,097
Thanks.

203
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:30,906
Where the fuck we at now !?

204
00:12:32,982 --> 00:12:34,400
Just buy four or five, Bernard.

205
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:36,465
Do it like that
and it'll go twice as quick.

206
00:12:37,453 --> 00:12:40,022
I want a Shrek Slurpee, Bernard.
And some Krispee Kreme.

207
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:46,866
All this from one disposable
cell phone ?

208
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:48,402
And a dead one, too.

209
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:53,315
It was used by Marlo's people
and picked up off the ground by Kima's C.I.

210
00:12:53,678 --> 00:12:55,451
Problem is it's just raw data.

211
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:58,231
We need to firm up what we know
about Marlo's operation

212
00:12:58,265 --> 00:12:59,966
with surveillance and C.I. info.

213
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:01,563
On the other hand

214
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:04,213
if we had a burner
that we knew was used

215
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:05,833
by one of Stringer's players...

216
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,848
we could use what we know
about that origination to make

217
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,963
all kinds of connections.

218
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:13,302
Get us one good phone,
we'll give you the network.

219
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:15,426
That's the good news.

220
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,517
What's the bad ?

221
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:18,605
It's all historical.

222
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:21,209
We can give you
the network no problem

223
00:13:21,726 --> 00:13:24,954
but by then it's a week old
and they've dumped their phones.

224
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:27,430
And how we get a wire up on that...

225
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:29,670
I haven't figured out yet.

226
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:32,333
Well, see that you do, detective.

227
00:13:43,338 --> 00:13:46,517
Oh, yeah. You keep this job.
I'ma gain some serious weight.

228
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:48,475
- Just the two ?
- Just the two.

229
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:50,998
Nigga, you ain't never
hearda buyin' in bulk ?

230
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,085
You could be savin'
them people all kinda money.

231
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:54,635
Or better still, spendin' it on me.

232
00:14:11,462 --> 00:14:13,198
Why you got a gun, Bernard ?

233
00:14:13,444 --> 00:14:15,954
You ain't heard ?
Avon's home, so we toolin' up.

234
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:18,465
You ain't the only one on parole.

235
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,611
Girl, you ridin'
my last good nerve.

236
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:22,799
That's not the only thing
I can ride.

237
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:24,466
Just get me back to the Interstate ?

238
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,939
<i>Big white bag,
got the big white bag !</i>

239
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:30,825
Which one is he, again ?

240
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:33,346
Broadus, street name of Bodie.

241
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:35,327
He used to bein the low-rises.

242
00:14:35,563 --> 00:14:37,122
Had a tower later on.

243
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:44,318
<i>Big white,
got the big white !</i>

244
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:50,349
How many more minutes you think
he's got on that phone ?

245
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:55,602
Fuck this, let's hit the bar.

246
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:57,656
Lester needs a phone, man.

247
00:14:57,961 --> 00:15:00,061
There's an easier way.
I'll show you tomorrow.

248
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:02,561
C'mon.

249
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,800
<i>Got the big white.</i>

250
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:05,360
I'm buying.

251
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:18,810
<i>Big white bag,
got the big white bag !</i>

252
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:24,361
She just wants
me to be happy, you know ?

253
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:28,093
An' I mean, I do the same for her,
when I can.

254
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,977
Like this thing
with the police detective ?

255
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,504
Brianna says she wants me
to go downtown with her, and...

256
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:38,259
I dunno,
hear the man out about Dee...

257
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:42,988
and I know there ain't nothing to it,
but she's all upset you know.

258
00:15:43,718 --> 00:15:45,512
And I tried to tell her
what you told me

259
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:50,535
but she says she wants to go down there
and talk to him herself I guess.

260
00:15:50,546 --> 00:15:51,790
You told her about the cop ?

261
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:53,419
What ?

262
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:54,686
About the detective.

263
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:56,411
What you told me, you told her ?

264
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:57,619
It's her son, right ?

265
00:15:58,688 --> 00:16:00,941
I mean, she got a right
to know what's goin' on.

266
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:05,242
- Look, I just thought...
- What ?!

267
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:10,662
Why the fuck you gonna get her
all upset over some bullshit ?

268
00:16:11,072 --> 00:16:13,742
Here we are, fuckin' year later,
everybody forgot about the shit

269
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:15,736
you go runnin' your
mouth about nothin' at all.

270
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:16,647
But, String...

271
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:18,502
What, an' she gonna
believe that shit, too.

272
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,999
What mom is not gonna believe
her son didn't kill hisself ?

273
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:21,879
String...

274
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:24,753
How she gonna take to that shit,
go half-crazy with it.

275
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,455
- I just...
- You just what ?

276
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:29,378
Sorry.

277
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:49,327
When you tell her that ?

278
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:51,145
'Bout a week ago, I guess.

279
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,068
When she gonna go see the cop ?

280
00:16:54,758 --> 00:16:56,504
Think she gonna
talk to a lawyer first.

281
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:58,218
- Ask him how to play it.
- Who Levy ?

282
00:16:58,535 --> 00:16:59,882
I guess, whoever.

283
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:01,230
- The lawyer.
- Levy ?

284
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:04,070
- I guess.
- Oh, you didn't ask that ?

285
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,896
And this fucking Royce
just lets it slide.

286
00:17:20,477 --> 00:17:21,627
I mean, I go to him, right ?

287
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,773
Not to make points,
just to do the right thing

288
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:25,615
what does he do
but blow smoke up my ass.

289
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:28,664
"I'm glad you came
to us with this, Tommy..."

290
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:31,434
"Oh, I'll light a fire, don't you worry.
We gotta move on this."

291
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:36,349
I never thought he'd have the balls
to just fuck the dog on it.

292
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:38,492
And you were doing the right thing.

293
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,184
Fuck yeah.

294
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:41,296
What ?

295
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,545
You went there hoping
that Royce would disappoint.

296
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,670
You want to know that you're better,
that you deserve his chair.

297
00:17:47,787 --> 00:17:50,438
If I lie down on this couch,
do you charge by the hour ?

298
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:52,082
Thanks.

299
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:54,944
You're not naive.

300
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:56,339
Neither am I.

301
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,171
A man doesn't run for office
without being a bit self-righteous first.

302
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:01,463
Self-righteous ?

303
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:03,094
Me ?

304
00:18:03,856 --> 00:18:05,216
So what are you gonna do now ?

305
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,816
Call a reporter or two,
rip the Mayor.

306
00:18:07,841 --> 00:18:10,068
Maybe on background,
maybe go on the record. I dunno.

307
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:10,832
Rip him now ?

308
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,013
With the primary next september ?

309
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,581
Tommy, no one's gonna remember
a dead witness a year from now ?

310
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:18,448
Better if you go to Royce

311
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:20,946
confront him, not angrily

312
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:23,981
give him a chance to explain.
Or maybe take action.

313
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,066
If he does do something,
then a problem got fixed

314
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,826
and you can feel
special for helping.

315
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:31,160
If he doesn't, you sit tight.

316
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:32,710
I don't know.

317
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:34,997
Maybe you document
your meeting in a letter

318
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:36,934
expressing your concern and regret.

319
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:39,703
Then you're set
if the next witness gets killed.

320
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:42,998
Win-win.

321
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:44,892
Unless you're the witness.

322
00:18:45,243 --> 00:18:46,546
I know, you're right.

323
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,434
But he's taking
on a two-term incumbent.

324
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:51,908
It's all gonna be ugly from here.

325
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:04,872
Yeah, it's cool.

326
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,306
Need another 30 by monday, a-ight.

327
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:10,068
A-ight.

328
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:19,414
Bitch, everything I say
you hear backwards.

329
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,361
Stupid little fucker.

330
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:27,195
Got them tees, bright white !

331
00:19:28,438 --> 00:19:30,174
One for three, two for five.

332
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,556
<i>Blue Tops, got them Blue Tops !</i>

333
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:35,299
I got them tees.

334
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,214
Bright white,
one for three, two for five.

335
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:52,483
I got this, man, five dollar.

336
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:54,172
- New.
- No thank you, man.

337
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,921
- It's only five dollars.
- No thank you.

338
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:57,656
Fuck you, man, fuck you.

339
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:58,430
Fuck you.

340
00:20:11,685 --> 00:20:12,706
I got them, uh...

341
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:16,541
I got them tees.

342
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:27,030
<i>Red Tops, Red Tops,
got them Red Tops !</i>

343
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:32,508
<i>Rockefeller,
got them Rockefeller here !</i>

344
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:42,829
Hey, seller man, what you got ?

345
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,639
Got the long white tees
for the young ones.

346
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:49,009
You ain't got candles ?
I'm lookin' to buy candles.

347
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:51,166
And toilet paper
for the shitbucket, too.

348
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,433
You be back here tomorrow ?

349
00:20:53,455 --> 00:20:55,684
I can't leave.
I leave, somebody grab my stake.

350
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:58,626
I'll be back tomorrow.

351
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:26,459
Yo, Johnny.

352
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:36,244
Was' up, Bubs.

353
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:42,699
Shit, Johnny, man.

354
00:21:44,115 --> 00:21:46,062
Just been chasin'
that pipe, you know.

355
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:49,827
Shit got me all diggin'
and scratchin' in my arms.

356
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:52,219
You know, it's cool.

357
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,227
Alright, come on, man,
you need a break. Alright ?

358
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,174
I'm serious, you need a break.
Come on, man.

359
00:21:58,209 --> 00:21:59,501
Naw, man, look around you.

360
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:03,665
Soldier's paradise, man.

361
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,786
I'm a viking, Bubs.

362
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:22,082
You a viking ?

363
00:22:38,674 --> 00:22:39,931
Fuck, not again.

364
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:43,188
You two coming ?

365
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:44,830
Major said to get 'em down here

366
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:46,837
he didn't say shit
'bout playin' nursemaid

367
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:48,163
to a bunch of goddamn animals.

368
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,942
Watch your back, watch your back.
Watch your back.

369
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:02,432
Should we cuff 'em, sarge ?

370
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:03,715
Naw, cut 'em loose.

371
00:23:05,373 --> 00:23:07,525
The fuck we tell you about
fighting down here ?

372
00:23:07,993 --> 00:23:10,734
Only rule is no fighting,
no cutting, no shooting !

373
00:23:10,905 --> 00:23:12,141
An' y'all still fuck it up.

374
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:16,172
Next time you make me come down here,
see if I don't call for a ten-thirty-eight.

375
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:19,349
So you know, dickhead,
that's an ambulance.

376
00:23:20,428 --> 00:23:22,619
Break it up,
break it up, break it up.

377
00:24:04,141 --> 00:24:05,454
Did I wake the baby ?

378
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,035
You would know if you did.

379
00:24:09,162 --> 00:24:11,446
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Nice of you to check in.

380
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,061
I went out after work to unwind.

381
00:24:14,124 --> 00:24:15,396
Yeah, you look unwound.

382
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:19,370
Well...

383
00:24:20,496 --> 00:24:23,297
I figured you had everything
under control on the homefront.

384
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:25,430
What the fuck is wrong with you ?

385
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:27,887
What's with the sarcasm ?

386
00:24:27,903 --> 00:24:30,156
How come you can talk
to everybody else but me ?

387
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:32,158
You really want to know ?

388
00:24:33,895 --> 00:24:34,628
I'm listening.

389
00:24:37,397 --> 00:24:38,397
I miss us.

390
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:41,870
Do not blame that baby.

391
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:44,188
Do not do it.

392
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,502
I'm not blamin' anybody.

393
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,552
I didn't do this by myself.

394
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,351
We discussed it, all of it.

395
00:24:49,678 --> 00:24:51,244
We talked about it, yeah.

396
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:52,480
But...

397
00:24:57,443 --> 00:24:59,604
I didn't have as much
to say about it as you.

398
00:25:00,418 --> 00:25:01,419
And why not ?

399
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,077
Because you...

400
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,301
you wanted this.

401
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:13,244
I didn't want
to disappoint you on it.

402
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:22,017
I don't think I could be more
disappointed than I am right now.

403
00:25:29,268 --> 00:25:30,019
You need to go.

404
00:26:02,991 --> 00:26:03,758
Quiet overnight ?

405
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,730
Midnight shift had to toss a crew
that was casing the place.

406
00:26:07,685 --> 00:26:08,702
But other than that...

407
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,925
Too many damn children.

408
00:26:14,968 --> 00:26:17,676
Whaddaya need lookouts and runners for
if the shit is legal ?

409
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:19,961
A lot of them have been cut
loose by the dealers.

410
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:22,167
It's like one of those nature shows

411
00:26:22,495 --> 00:26:24,097
where you mess
with the environment

412
00:26:24,112 --> 00:26:26,193
some species gets
fucked out of their habitat.

413
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,383
Did you just use the word
habitat in a sentence ?

414
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:28,884
I did.

415
00:26:38,837 --> 00:26:40,479
You let your lookouts go ?

416
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:41,700
My runners, too.

417
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:43,170
Shit, what's the point ?

418
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,787
So here you are
making money hand over fist

419
00:26:45,818 --> 00:26:48,338
and you're too damn greedy
to take care of your work force.

420
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:49,075
I don't need 'em.

421
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:51,077
But they need you, right ?

422
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:53,908
You was all they had
when you couldn't work a corner

423
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,136
except for touts and runners

424
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:57,436
then it was cool to have them
cut school and work out.

425
00:27:02,132 --> 00:27:03,805
Okay, new tax initiative,
my brother.

426
00:27:04,275 --> 00:27:04,995
Say what ?

427
00:27:05,051 --> 00:27:07,038
If you wanna sling
in Hamsterdam after today

428
00:27:07,054 --> 00:27:10,262
you an' every other knucklehead
you each gotta kick in a hunnert a week.

429
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:11,982
Oh, so you tryin' to get paid, huh.

430
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,298
Not me, not for me.

431
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,260
Get the cash up, I'll be back.

432
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,491
But it ain't something I'm gonna
go to jail for, right ?

433
00:27:42,523 --> 00:27:44,509
I mean, it ain't nothing
like that is it ?

434
00:27:53,979 --> 00:27:54,448
That one ?

435
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:56,783
No, it was more black than silver.

436
00:27:57,832 --> 00:27:58,676
This one, I think.

437
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:08,151
I can see y'all got some real
ugly shit planned for me.

438
00:28:08,497 --> 00:28:09,372
I can see it.

439
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:15,834
You just bumped up against
a clever police is all.

440
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,852
Course he's gonna try
to shame you with the dead girl

441
00:28:18,884 --> 00:28:22,672
or some mess about children lookin' up
to Omar an' his sawed-off.

442
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:24,662
All he can do

443
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:28,005
especially since you backed down
what he had for a witness.

444
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,297
He workin' you with guilt, boy.

445
00:28:32,408 --> 00:28:35,387
Yeah, but that fat man gave me
an itch I can't scratch, Butchie.

446
00:28:35,418 --> 00:28:38,687
Everybody in this world does
what they gonna do.

447
00:28:39,172 --> 00:28:41,316
Me, you, that police.

448
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:44,469
Everybody in this world
got their own place.

449
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:47,945
An' a man in your line of work

450
00:28:47,946 --> 00:28:50,399
start worryin' about how other
people see you

451
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,706
playin' the other people,
instead of to hisself, he gonna get dead.

452
00:29:03,228 --> 00:29:05,153
I still feel like
I owe somethin', Butch.

453
00:29:07,735 --> 00:29:12,210
I had an uncle down Carolina,
he dead now

454
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:16,094
but I remember he was
grieving real hard

455
00:29:16,095 --> 00:29:19,374
real hard over chasin'
his lady friend away.

456
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,839
So he put himself to punishment.

457
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:26,141
Took a knife to his little finger
then his ring finger.

458
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:30,084
With them all bloody on
the table, he pulled up short.

459
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,760
For the rest of his life

460
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,961
I remember him sayin' the bitch
weren't worth more than a pinkie.

461
00:29:40,354 --> 00:29:41,637
But it was too late then.

462
00:29:42,544 --> 00:29:44,265
You can try that
if you have a mind.

463
00:29:45,764 --> 00:29:46,907
I dunno, Butchie.

464
00:29:48,268 --> 00:29:49,800
A little somethin' less dramatical.

465
00:29:50,896 --> 00:29:51,694
Ya feel me ?

466
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,894
You told Brianna she could go
downtown with this ?

467
00:29:56,927 --> 00:29:58,944
D'Angelo's her son,
how was I gonna stop her ?

468
00:29:59,977 --> 00:30:01,275
Look, look there's no harm done

469
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:03,482
if she just keeps
her mouth shut and just listens.

470
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:04,748
Naw, naw.
It's fucked up.

471
00:30:05,266 --> 00:30:07,927
There ain't no call messin'
with Brianna with this bullshit.

472
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,055
What can you do ?

473
00:30:09,148 --> 00:30:09,727
I dunno.

474
00:30:09,742 --> 00:30:12,590
File a kinda complaint against
the detective or some shit. I dunno.

475
00:30:12,605 --> 00:30:13,200
Harassment ?

476
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,361
This the same motherfucker
that had Avon's case.

477
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,759
Same motherfucker that's comin' at me
in my print shop talkin' shit.

478
00:30:19,775 --> 00:30:22,435
An' now he's comin' up
at Brianna with this bullshit ?

479
00:30:22,716 --> 00:30:24,549
A complaint's
not going to do anything.

480
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:26,410
And the fact is

481
00:30:26,864 --> 00:30:29,250
if the cops are saying
her son might not be a suicide

482
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:31,221
Brianna's gonna
hear this out regardless.

483
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:35,415
I suppose Avon
should know about it, though.

484
00:30:37,715 --> 00:30:39,035
Yeah, well, I'll handle that.

485
00:30:52,842 --> 00:30:54,501
Not much slinging going on here.

486
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:56,707
Western boys are sittin'
on the real estate.

487
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,443
Yeah... a-ight, a-ight.
That'll work, too.

488
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:06,024
A-ight.

489
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:09,407
Yo, Shamrock says we should
take some of our people down

490
00:31:09,408 --> 00:31:10,801
to Hamsterdam and sell off there.

491
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:13,742
At least until these knockos
roll up off some of these corners.

492
00:31:14,462 --> 00:31:14,869
C'mon.

493
00:31:21,503 --> 00:31:22,442
Car stop, maybe ?

494
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:23,553
Why not ?

495
00:31:49,438 --> 00:31:50,861
Not yet, you fuckin' rodent.

496
00:32:04,524 --> 00:32:06,949
You all can't do this, man.
We headin' to Hamsterdam.

497
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:08,216
You come off that car again

498
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:10,625
an' you goin' to Bon Secours
emergency room. You hear me ?

499
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:12,440
Yo, officer,
we got immunity from y'all.

500
00:32:12,454 --> 00:32:13,894
We goin' to the free zone.

501
00:32:13,956 --> 00:32:15,303
What the fuck's the free zone ?

502
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,304
Ho shit.

503
00:32:18,306 --> 00:32:19,244
Packaged for sale.

504
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,041
Hey, straight up.

505
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:22,389
Why you think we headed
there in the first place ?

506
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:24,126
Headed where ?

507
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,079
Hamsterdam.

508
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:26,499
Suck my dick !

509
00:32:33,147 --> 00:32:35,415
Hey, y'all wanna see a wagon !

510
00:32:35,524 --> 00:32:36,251
Fuck y'all !

511
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:38,598
You just shut the fuck up
and cut this shit out now !

512
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,041
Like you said.

513
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:51,703
That's your receipt.

514
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,223
Two-forty-four for
the hoop comes back to me

515
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,806
rounding to two
and a half for my gas money.

516
00:32:58,761 --> 00:32:59,715
This repays me.

517
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:02,406
The rest of this ?

518
00:33:02,922 --> 00:33:04,784
Use it to pay
them hoppers for the week.

519
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:07,194
Whether you use 'em or not,
you pay this money out.

520
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:09,608
Shit is like
unemployment insurance.

521
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,485
Every employer got to pay in.

522
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:13,301
And if I find out anybody holding out

523
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:16,164
he's out of here and back on the street
gettin' his head busted.

524
00:33:16,545 --> 00:33:19,250
Least y'all can do is look after
your own people a little bit.

525
00:33:21,097 --> 00:33:22,646
What are you a fuckin' communist ?

526
00:33:23,053 --> 00:33:26,229
<i>23 o' four. Need a couple of 10-16s,
to Fayette west of Vincent.</i>

527
00:33:26,394 --> 00:33:28,179
That's right around
the corner from here.

528
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:29,823
<i>Ten-four, units responding.</i>

529
00:33:39,342 --> 00:33:40,234
The fuck happened ?

530
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:41,392
Car stop.

531
00:33:41,737 --> 00:33:43,788
I got a g-pack from beneath
the passenger seat.

532
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:47,307
Yo, we was on our way to Hamsterdam
an' the man say we don't get hassled

533
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:48,809
comin' in or goin' out.
Was' up ?

534
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:50,421
What the fuck is Hamsterdam ?

535
00:33:50,437 --> 00:33:51,798
<i>Lyin' ass poh-leece !</i>

536
00:33:52,423 --> 00:33:53,645
I can't let you do this.

537
00:33:53,753 --> 00:33:55,256
Carv, they got a g-pack.

538
00:33:55,507 --> 00:33:57,932
On the way to the free zone, they did.
You know the rules.

539
00:33:57,946 --> 00:34:00,124
Yeah, man, and I was tryin'
to tell these people...

540
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:00,890
Shut the fuck up.

541
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:03,823
<i>700 to any unit at the scene
at Fayette and Vincent.</i>

542
00:34:03,854 --> 00:34:04,589
Yeah, boss.

543
00:34:05,372 --> 00:34:06,687
<i>You got a situation there ?</i>

544
00:34:07,189 --> 00:34:08,658
I can't believe this bullshit.

545
00:34:08,784 --> 00:34:10,177
Yeah, bullshit is right.

546
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:11,664
I told you to shut the fuck up.

547
00:34:11,694 --> 00:34:14,370
Yo, man, y'all gave your fuckin' word.
You know you did, man.

548
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,764
This is so fuckin' bullshit.

549
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,240
Y'all some fuckin' liar'y man.

550
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:20,009
Carv, will you please tell me
what the fuck is going on here ?

551
00:34:21,776 --> 00:34:23,044
Major said he's on his way.

552
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:26,531
Carv ?

553
00:34:31,288 --> 00:34:32,149
Oh, man.

554
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:47,139
Sure that's the one ?

555
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:49,153
Reesie say that was the one.

556
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,311
Who am I to say different.

557
00:34:54,706 --> 00:34:57,149
Tell him I ain't gonna pay
'til it proves itself though.

558
00:34:57,164 --> 00:34:58,368
I told him that already.

559
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,979
He say 1500 for his trouble.

560
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:02,622
Damn.

561
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,829
Conscience do cost.

562
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:28,799
I seen him, Bernard.

563
00:35:28,846 --> 00:35:32,290
You hadn't even gone past the damn door
and he threw all the papers in the trash.

564
00:35:32,305 --> 00:35:33,510
You lyin' now, I can tell.

565
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:35,481
You is the only one
who gives a fuck.

566
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:37,531
An' if you hadn't been
the stupidest mothercker

567
00:35:37,545 --> 00:35:39,882
that I ever gone out with,
you'd just would have bought

568
00:35:39,897 --> 00:35:41,477
a whole bunchaf them
things at once.

569
00:35:41,493 --> 00:35:44,045
Only need like six more.
We be done in, like, half an hour.

570
00:35:44,106 --> 00:35:47,738
How 'bout we make one more
stop you get six of them shits

571
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:50,179
and I suck your dick
for the next 20 minutes.

572
00:36:10,451 --> 00:36:11,030
Gotcha.

573
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:13,783
Fuck.

574
00:36:15,316 --> 00:36:16,505
Fuck y'all.

575
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,261
Shit. I worked a double, man.

576
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:22,100
<i>Bunk, line three.</i>

577
00:36:27,012 --> 00:36:28,200
Detective Moreland.

578
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,182
Heard you lookin' for something.

579
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,345
Lemme get some of them
Trac phones activated.

580
00:36:37,407 --> 00:36:38,299
Eight of 'em bitches.

581
00:36:49,694 --> 00:36:50,883
This one for sector two.

582
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:54,997
Sector one, I'm using the empty
low-rise housing on Winchester.

583
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,032
Sector three, the old Koppers plant.

584
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,643
And it's legal to sell here ?

585
00:36:58,938 --> 00:36:59,629
It's not legal.

586
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,210
We just look the other way is all.

587
00:37:03,508 --> 00:37:04,480
How ? How can you ?

588
00:37:04,871 --> 00:37:06,764
I know it hurts your heads
to think about it

589
00:37:06,778 --> 00:37:08,844
but before you decide
to lose your minds on this

590
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:11,837
take a moment, ride around to my corners,
my worst drug corners.

591
00:37:12,322 --> 00:37:15,796
Edmondson and Brice.
North and Pulaski. Hollins and Payson.

592
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:17,189
They're empty.

593
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:18,925
All of them.

594
00:37:20,509 --> 00:37:22,534
District-wide, my crime
is down five percent.

595
00:37:22,886 --> 00:37:23,951
But do the bosses know ?

596
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:26,173
No, the bosses
don't know shit about it.

597
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:29,473
This is just a district commander,
taking an initiative on his own.

598
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:30,687
Jesus christ !

599
00:37:32,766 --> 00:37:35,159
I knew it was only a matter
of time before I bumped into

600
00:37:35,176 --> 00:37:36,648
somebody from downtown about this.

601
00:37:36,664 --> 00:37:38,994
And I know your natural
impulse is to take what you saw

602
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:41,045
back downtown with you,
but I gotta ask you...

603
00:37:41,076 --> 00:37:42,120
You legalized drugs ?

604
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,515
Look, this is a tactical deployment.

605
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:48,144
We just wait for everything
to get settled down here

606
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,975
in these three zones
and then we move.

607
00:37:52,117 --> 00:37:54,261
Look, we make a big show
of lockin' everybody up

608
00:37:54,278 --> 00:37:55,482
and then we shut it down.

609
00:38:00,456 --> 00:38:02,460
I'm sorry I had to
fuck you up on that arrest

610
00:38:05,127 --> 00:38:07,758
and I'm sorry you had to see us
give that runt back the g-pack.

611
00:38:07,774 --> 00:38:08,758
That was ugly, I know.

612
00:38:11,028 --> 00:38:13,504
But I'm just tryin' to save
what's left of my district

613
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,146
anyway I can, if I can.

614
00:38:15,805 --> 00:38:18,308
And the longer I have before
I have to brief the bosses

615
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:19,497
about this deployment...

616
00:38:19,528 --> 00:38:21,562
We got all we needed
from the car stop, major.

617
00:38:21,578 --> 00:38:22,320
Don't sweat it.

618
00:38:25,902 --> 00:38:27,732
Let me get a word
with my old commander.

619
00:38:33,974 --> 00:38:34,709
I dunno, Major.

620
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:39,247
Whenever you bust this place up,
they'll go back to their same corners.

621
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:42,188
Besides, you were never
much on making a big show.

622
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,615
If this doesn't work, Jimmy,
we're back to the usual

623
00:38:49,771 --> 00:38:51,712
and I'm out the door
on a pension anyway.

624
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,108
But, Jimmy, I need more time.

625
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:59,206
I need to be able to rely on you
and your people to keep this close.

626
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:03,869
The bosses don't know, huh ?

627
00:39:08,618 --> 00:39:09,650
Fuck the bosses.

628
00:39:25,412 --> 00:39:26,570
You the man who called ?

629
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:31,144
I did.

630
00:39:36,386 --> 00:39:37,805
You witnessin' or what ?

631
00:39:42,594 --> 00:39:44,048
I'm afraid I'm blind.

632
00:39:45,394 --> 00:39:46,239
Legally.

633
00:39:50,902 --> 00:39:52,451
Something you need to see though.

634
00:40:05,724 --> 00:40:07,116
Glock 40, I believe.

635
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,583
I suppose you ain't going to tell me
who brought this here, right ?

636
00:40:18,598 --> 00:40:19,584
Like I say

637
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:21,569
I'm blind.

638
00:40:24,634 --> 00:40:26,123
I thought you might know, though.

639
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,465
You tell him for me

640
00:40:39,483 --> 00:40:41,879
I'm hopin' he might need
this in court some day.

641
00:40:56,369 --> 00:40:57,793
Knockos might come back.

642
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,671
They might.

643
00:41:00,437 --> 00:41:03,317
But until they do,
this your corner to hold.

644
00:41:03,698 --> 00:41:05,091
What about Marlo's crew ?

645
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:08,393
Look, Avon's home,
and you on a Barksdale corner.

646
00:41:08,408 --> 00:41:09,440
Ya feel me ?

647
00:41:10,238 --> 00:41:11,507
Avon ain't here now.

648
00:41:11,649 --> 00:41:12,650
You got muscle.

649
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,131
Don't worry about that, little man.

650
00:41:24,827 --> 00:41:25,234
Hey...

651
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,648
the burner of young Bodie Broadus

652
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:32,120
it still has minutes left.

653
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:35,484
Speed dial ?

654
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:43,048
Caroline.

655
00:41:43,705 --> 00:41:46,255
You wouldn't have an extra room
at your place, would you ?

656
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:50,426
Jus' for a night or two,
'til I can get my shit together.

657
00:41:50,802 --> 00:41:51,819
Ain't no fixin' it ?

658
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,761
It's fixed pretty good, I think.

659
00:41:58,964 --> 00:41:59,464
Thanks.

660
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:08,507
Credit card was a business account
listed to a Theresa D'Agostino.

661
00:42:08,748 --> 00:42:09,923
Yeah, that's her.

662
00:42:11,455 --> 00:42:12,535
What kinda business ?

663
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,025
Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.

664
00:42:15,806 --> 00:42:17,871
Billing on the card goes
to a business address

665
00:42:17,872 --> 00:42:18,952
in northwest Washington.

666
00:42:19,927 --> 00:42:21,836
I called the switchboard
and she's listed.

667
00:42:26,468 --> 00:42:29,958
D'Agostino doesn't sound much
like a west Baltimore name to me.

668
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:31,135
Me either.

669
00:42:36,001 --> 00:42:38,551
Truth is, I don't know what I want.

670
00:42:39,365 --> 00:42:40,914
I'm know I'm lookin' for somethin'

671
00:42:41,414 --> 00:42:43,625
but I can't even
tell you what it is.

672
00:42:45,051 --> 00:42:46,646
I understand you found work.

673
00:42:47,366 --> 00:42:49,853
Ain't no payroll job, but it'll do.

674
00:42:52,685 --> 00:42:54,015
You ain't here for a job.

675
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,487
Or the G.E.D. program.

676
00:42:57,238 --> 00:42:58,960
So you lookin' to join the church ?

677
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:04,141
I, um...

678
00:43:06,034 --> 00:43:07,067
I just...

679
00:43:09,038 --> 00:43:11,399
I've had this feelin'
for a long time

680
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:16,948
and it's like
I'm standing outside myself

681
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,625
watching me do things
I don't wanna do, you know ?

682
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,908
Jus' seein' me like
I'm somebody else

683
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,836
but never ever bein' able
to stop the show.

684
00:43:32,438 --> 00:43:33,266
I'm tired.

685
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:36,469
It's Cutty, right ?

686
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:39,363
Naw, man.

687
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:41,491
Dennis.

688
00:43:42,743 --> 00:43:43,697
She's left, huh ?

689
00:43:45,043 --> 00:43:47,620
I figured that because, ah,
I'm supposed to meet her actually.

690
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:50,139
Tonight, yeah...

691
00:43:52,704 --> 00:43:53,816
right, exactly.

692
00:43:56,131 --> 00:43:58,153
I was going to pick her up
and take her to that

693
00:43:58,185 --> 00:43:59,172
but I'm running late...

694
00:44:00,189 --> 00:44:02,192
Yeah, yeah, I know...

695
00:44:03,788 --> 00:44:04,774
Where is that exactly ?

696
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,760
I'm not really familiar
with that part of...

697
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,930
Too many damn scheduling
conflicts, unfortunately.

698
00:44:16,103 --> 00:44:18,425
But we have put it
on the agenda for the next meeting

699
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:20,944
of the coordinating council
on criminal justice.

700
00:44:21,852 --> 00:44:23,510
You're sentencing it to committee ?

701
00:44:24,511 --> 00:44:27,752
Mr. Mayor, we're probably only talking,
like, a few hundred thousand to start.

702
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:30,397
I'm not saying we should create
new identities for these people

703
00:44:30,412 --> 00:44:32,196
and send 'em to New
Mexico like the feds.

704
00:44:32,258 --> 00:44:34,154
We just need to get them
out of harm's way.

705
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:35,718
Lemme tell you something,
Councilman.

706
00:44:35,733 --> 00:44:38,104
I can't lay my hands on several
hundred thousand dollars

707
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:39,449
that is not already spoken for.

708
00:44:39,465 --> 00:44:42,265
- Mr. Mayor, I was not...
- What would you have me do, Councilman ?

709
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,615
Should I divert the money
that's already been budgeted

710
00:44:44,631 --> 00:44:46,931
for snow removal from
the first district this winter ?

711
00:44:46,947 --> 00:44:49,343
How 'bout I reduce trash pickup
to once a week citywide

712
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:52,985
put the witnesses up
at the Hyatt Inner Harbor ?

713
00:44:53,927 --> 00:44:56,579
I'm not trying to be difficult,
Tommy. Come on...

714
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,874
the city in the
financial situation it's in

715
00:45:00,191 --> 00:45:01,881
very few friends in Annapolis

716
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:05,062
we've done all we can do
with this matter for now.

717
00:45:06,188 --> 00:45:06,951
Okay, then.

718
00:45:10,822 --> 00:45:11,958
Thanks for your time.

719
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:12,991
Gentlemen.

720
00:45:41,523 --> 00:45:42,427
Nah, what the fuck.

721
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:57,007
I dunno, boss. If there weren't
so many fucking kids down here

722
00:45:57,018 --> 00:45:58,074
I might be okay with it.

723
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:09,836
Baltimore police.

724
00:46:10,633 --> 00:46:11,275
Baltimore ?

725
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,822
Baltimore, Maryland.

726
00:46:25,348 --> 00:46:26,404
Can I get a Jameson's ?

727
00:46:26,438 --> 00:46:27,318
Bushmills, okay ?

728
00:46:27,706 --> 00:46:28,842
That's protestant whiskey.

729
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:31,014
The price is right, ain't it ?

730
00:46:31,271 --> 00:46:31,845
Make it neat.

731
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:03,565
Excuse me.

732
00:47:11,237 --> 00:47:11,671
Hey.

733
00:47:12,822 --> 00:47:13,208
Hey.

734
00:47:13,983 --> 00:47:15,084
What are you doing here ?

735
00:47:15,452 --> 00:47:17,200
I was just asking myself
the same thing.

736
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,733
You drive all the way
down here to look at me

737
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:22,174
from across the room and then leave ?
That's kinda creepy.

738
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:23,056
You looked occupied.

739
00:47:23,138 --> 00:47:24,662
Him ?
Honey, that's just business.

740
00:47:26,234 --> 00:47:27,548
This ain't my kind of crowd.

741
00:47:27,782 --> 00:47:28,475
Definitely not.

742
00:47:28,522 --> 00:47:30,456
Yeah, well, I made a mistake,
so I'm gonna go.

743
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:32,720
Four-twenty-eight.

744
00:47:34,128 --> 00:47:35,113
You live in this town.

745
00:47:36,193 --> 00:47:37,296
Why book the room ?

746
00:47:37,378 --> 00:47:38,405
I live across town.

747
00:47:38,851 --> 00:47:41,104
As late as these things go,
that's a D.U.I. away.

748
00:47:42,253 --> 00:47:43,496
Give me two hours, McNulty.

749
00:47:44,107 --> 00:47:45,608
What am I gonna do for two hours ?

750
00:47:46,452 --> 00:47:47,262
Dream on it.

751
00:47:53,964 --> 00:47:54,891
Water's fresh ?

752
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,354
You keepin' them cool ?

753
00:48:00,727 --> 00:48:02,686
You got squeakers nestin' squabs.

754
00:48:04,985 --> 00:48:07,707
Takin' care of the younguns,
I like seein' that.

755
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,747
Yeah, Marlo, he's real loyal.

756
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:13,300
You can't kick him off that nest.

757
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:14,332
Good work.

758
00:48:15,776 --> 00:48:16,913
That's really good work.

759
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:19,118
Police comin' off them corners.

760
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:20,901
I seen.

761
00:48:23,506 --> 00:48:25,770
I'm gonna keep my name off
the package for a time

762
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,096
keep wholesalin'.

763
00:48:28,376 --> 00:48:29,583
You know, step back a bit.

764
00:48:30,767 --> 00:48:32,304
Barksdale gonna think we weak

765
00:48:33,336 --> 00:48:34,932
not comin' out
to claim what's ours.

766
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:39,662
The police leave them corners,
he's gonna be back out there.

767
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:40,624
I know he will.

768
00:48:46,354 --> 00:48:47,139
Your turn, girl.

769
00:48:47,795 --> 00:48:48,980
It's a bout time.

770
00:48:49,555 --> 00:48:50,071
For real.

771
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,186
For starters

772
00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:58,306
its memory holds the last 10 calls
made and received by the user.

773
00:48:58,447 --> 00:49:00,183
That's enough
to give us a signature.

774
00:49:00,581 --> 00:49:01,250
Signature ?

775
00:49:01,308 --> 00:49:03,290
The phone numbers
unique to an individual.

776
00:49:03,444 --> 00:49:06,545
That way we can identify the user
when he switches to another phone.

777
00:49:07,847 --> 00:49:09,923
Sorry, I'm late.
Woke up in the wrong town.

778
00:49:12,437 --> 00:49:14,557
Anyway, we ran the tolls
on those numbers

779
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:17,407
and we came up with
a rather interesting pattern.

780
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,673
Check this out.

781
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:21,101
This is the pattern of a clod
communication network.

782
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,608
Something you would expect
from a drug organization.

783
00:49:24,054 --> 00:49:29,418
This particular one so far
involves 15 distinct burners.

784
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:30,273
15.

785
00:49:31,377 --> 00:49:34,107
And none of them list
subscriber information.

786
00:49:34,177 --> 00:49:34,928
You can do that ?

787
00:49:34,951 --> 00:49:37,180
With these burners,
with this particular company

788
00:49:37,215 --> 00:49:38,987
you don't need
subscriber information.

789
00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:45,471
Our data shows that over 92% of the calls
are made within this network

790
00:49:45,647 --> 00:49:47,934
with the average call
lasting less than a minute.

791
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:50,713
Again, suggestive
of drug trafficking.

792
00:49:51,675 --> 00:49:55,215
This user here,
he serves as a clearing house.

793
00:49:55,275 --> 00:49:57,622
He receives calls,
and initiates interactions.

794
00:49:57,623 --> 00:49:58,949
He coordinates the show.

795
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,450
Be nice if that was Stringer.

796
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:04,164
Now this is the best part,
this is something that Prez discovered

797
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:05,361
when he was playing with it.

798
00:50:05,396 --> 00:50:07,449
It has a speed dial feature.

799
00:50:12,151 --> 00:50:16,422
Meaning, someone took
the time to program the phone.

800
00:50:16,575 --> 00:50:18,956
Hell, that's probably
the only way these corner boys

801
00:50:18,967 --> 00:50:20,234
can remember all the numbers

802
00:50:20,305 --> 00:50:22,838
what with these phones being
dumped every few days or so.

803
00:50:23,792 --> 00:50:26,702
I'll bet all the other phones
in the network are set up the same way.

804
00:50:26,725 --> 00:50:27,760
Well I've heard enough.

805
00:50:27,912 --> 00:50:29,542
We should start writing for the wire.

806
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:30,562
When can we get up ?

807
00:50:30,645 --> 00:50:31,501
Get up on what ?

808
00:50:31,536 --> 00:50:33,796
They're dumping phones
every couple weeks on average.

809
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,412
By the time you get a wire up
on that, the phones are dead.

810
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:39,357
The whole network
shuts down simultaneously.

811
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,123
Do we have a plan ?

812
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:44,400
Not yet we don't.

813
00:50:44,893 --> 00:50:47,532
But for now, if I could get a couple more
of these dead phones

814
00:50:47,567 --> 00:50:50,195
it'll probably help corroborate
the theory for the affidavit.

815
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,690
Kima, maybe you could ask
those western boys to pick up

816
00:50:52,737 --> 00:50:54,922
what they find on the ground
for the next few days.

817
00:50:54,977 --> 00:50:55,633
Yeah, sure.

818
00:51:00,473 --> 00:51:02,901
Damn boy, you smell like sex.

819
00:51:03,134 --> 00:51:05,199
You didn't take a fucking shower ?

820
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:06,266
Late for work.

821
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:14,265
You forgot my Newports,
didn't you ?

822
00:51:14,277 --> 00:51:16,458
Aw shit, man. I did, yo.

823
00:51:17,103 --> 00:51:19,543
Lemme do up these chips
an' then I'll go get your cigs.

824
00:51:51,703 --> 00:51:52,172
Fuck.

825
00:52:00,677 --> 00:52:02,811
<i>Three one, shooting
at the number one Mayo.</i>

826
00:52:02,975 --> 00:52:04,748
<i>We're gonna need
some suits down here.</i>

827
00:52:05,328 --> 00:52:07,310
<i>For investigation ? I'm on my way.</i>

828
00:52:08,377 --> 00:52:09,222
<i>Roger, 10 hundred.</i>

829
00:52:09,245 --> 00:52:09,961
Back so soon.

830
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,081
I thought you guys had enough
of our happy district yesterday.

831
00:52:13,386 --> 00:52:14,462
Just need a favor.

832
00:52:14,778 --> 00:52:17,327
Lester wants you to scoop up
any discarded cell phones

833
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:18,874
you find on Barksdale corners.

834
00:52:19,074 --> 00:52:20,610
You want Barksdale license plates.

835
00:52:20,821 --> 00:52:22,757
- Tag numbers and all ?
- Whatever, sure.

836
00:52:23,011 --> 00:52:25,497
'Cause I saw the big man
riding in a truck the other day.

837
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:27,374
Missed the tag,
but if I see him again...

838
00:52:27,467 --> 00:52:28,067
Stringer ?

839
00:52:28,794 --> 00:52:30,718
- Naw, the other guy.
- What other guy ?

840
00:52:30,999 --> 00:52:32,385
Big boy, the one we locked up.

841
00:52:33,304 --> 00:52:34,851
- Avon.
- Avon Barksdale ?

842
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,487
Jesus, Herc. He's at Jessup,
down for four or five at least.

843
00:52:38,898 --> 00:52:40,364
What, we all look alike to you ?

844
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:42,162
If you don't believe me fuck it.

845
00:52:42,452 --> 00:52:43,567
No fuckin' way...

846
00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:46,017
but the fact remains

847
00:52:46,345 --> 00:52:50,125
we would not be returning
this service weapon to this officer

848
00:52:50,723 --> 00:52:53,714
without help from the citizens
of Baltimore as well.

849
00:52:54,577 --> 00:52:58,319
And on that note, I think our Mayor
would like to say a few words.

850
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:05,084
Thank you, Commissioner Burrell.

851
00:53:05,131 --> 00:53:08,111
I just want to take this opportunity
to commend our department

852
00:53:08,134 --> 00:53:10,504
on successfully resolving this case

853
00:53:11,008 --> 00:53:15,368
and to wish officer Dozerman
a speedy return to duty.

854
00:53:18,726 --> 00:53:19,640
<i>Officer Dozerman</i>

855
00:53:20,779 --> 00:53:22,777
<i>the citizens want you
to have this back</i>

856
00:53:24,865 --> 00:53:28,431
<i>and to thank you for your
service in defense of our city.</i>

857
00:53:31,065 --> 00:53:34,659
<i>and I especially want to thank all
of our concerned residents</i>

858
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:38,412
<i>who called into the hotline.
We would not be here today...</i>

859
00:53:56,242 --> 00:53:56,992
Lester.

860
00:53:57,695 --> 00:53:59,737
Lieutenant, you gotta see this.

861
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:12,699
Big joke.

862
00:54:13,305 --> 00:55:13,467

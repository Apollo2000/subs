2
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,000
Fucking-A.

3
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, shit is good.

4
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,300
Here. Next time we re-up, though...

5
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,800
tell Moe man we need about 700,
800 more of them dimes, all right?

6
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,100
I ain't even seen shit like this
since I don't know when.

7
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,900
-Same with the jumbos?
-Yeah, better get more of those, too.

8
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,900
What the fuck is up now?
String, what's up, man?

9
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,900
What up? Can't call it.

10
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,500
-How's our package?
-How's it look? Shit is good.

11
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,500
See these Eastside motherfuckers
over here?

12
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,700
I want you to extend
to these motherfuckers...

13
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,400
all the hospitality that
West Baltimore is famous for.

14
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,100
-You heard?
-You want us to fuck them up?

15
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,400
No, dawg.

16
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,700
We're giving them 221, 734, and Saratoga.

17
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,700
We keep the rest. If anybody start any shit...

18
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,500
they'll have to answer to me,
all right? Directly.

19
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,900
You heard me, right?

20
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,000
All right.

21
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,400
What are these off-brand niggers gonna do
with a project tower?

22
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,800
Fall back, young 'un.

23
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,700
We're gonna show y'all motherfuckers
how to grind out here, all right?

24
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,400
Hey, String.

25
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
I heard you, man, I did.

26
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,400
But this shit right here,
it don't make no sense.

27
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
You like the new product we selling?

28
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,600
It make sense now?

29
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,100
-Where are we at with our Boss Man?
-We should be up on his phone soon.

30
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,100
-The PC is there, no question.
-We get up on his cell phone, he's done.

31
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,500
We'll ID him, no problem.

32
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,100
I don't know. They came down on that
warehouse phone when we spooked them.

33
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,600
Sobotka's cell phone, too.
We might be going up on a dead line.

34
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,800
This is the other way to go.

35
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,000
Compared to the wiretap,
it's the longer way around.

36
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,200
But still, if he's changing up
on his cell phone....

37
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,700
Over the last week or so...

38
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,400
we've not only confirmed the identities
of some of the key players...

39
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,100
we've also got GPS trackers
on all their cars.

40
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,800
First of all...

41
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,200
Eton Ben-Eleazer.
He's the drug Lieutenant in the warehouse.

42
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
-E-ton.
-Whatever.

43
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,300
Our madam, Miss llona Petrovna.

44
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,500
George Glekas, who runs
the appliance store over in Highlandtown...

45
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,600
and the probable fence for the organization.
We followed some of them in real time.

46
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,200
With this little toy here,
there's something else we can do.

47
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,600
That's seven days
of where our targets have been, sped up.

48
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,600
And lookit. Two locations only...

49
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,300
where three or four cars stopped
at the same time for more than five minutes.

50
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,800
One "X" is a dive of a diner
down on South Clinton.

51
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,300
The other is on the western shore
of Fort Howard down past Edgemere.

52
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,000
We get up on these locations,
maybe we get a photo of the Boss Man.

53
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,900
-Or a tag number.
-It's totally cool.

54
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,500
-Where did you even get this stuff?
-DEA for the trackers.

55
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,400
McNulty pulled the software
from his pals at the FBI field office.

56
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,100
We can pull Herc and Carver
off the warehouse and give them the diner.

57
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,100
McNulty, Bunk, you guys take Fort Howard.

58
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,200
What the fuck, Frank?

59
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,300
You might as well
start posting them things, right?

60
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,600
I mean, shit, if you're gonna run,
you might as well come out and say so.

61
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,400
It ain't personal, Ott.

62
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,400
I want to finish what I started
with the dredging issue.

63
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,400
And you don't think I'm good enough
to handle it.

64
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,700
It ain't about that, kiddo.

65
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,400
Ott, listen to me!

66
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,100
What the fuck do you want me to do?
Tell him where the money comes from?

67
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,300
I.B.S.?

68
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,900
Not to brag, but union racketeering
is one thing the Bureau does well.

69
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,800
That is exactly what I wanted to hear.
This case needs closure, boys.

70
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,200
And in my heart of hearts...

71
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,000
I know you're the kind of bastards
to put Sobotka where he needs to be.

72
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,500
One other thing
you Federals can help me with.

73
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,200
And if you don't mind,
a little discretion is called for.

74
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,300
That, right there,
is the district surveillance van...

75
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,300
which was fully equipped
when it disappeared.

76
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,500
A surveillance van?

77
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,700
Sobotka stole it.
Now it's l-don't-know-where.

78
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,200
The last picture was from Seattle...

79
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,800
but I got prints...

80
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,200
from two other places, see?

81
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,100
You reported the van stolen, right?

82
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,800
It was my feeling that the theft
of a vehicle from a departmental lot...

83
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,500
would reflect poorly on the department.

84
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,500
The thing is, I know you boys
have got enough reach...

85
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,300
to maybe get the van back
without no big dustup.

86
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,000
As a favor for me
having brought you the whole case.

87
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,800
Motherfucking Eastside
need to get their asses...

88
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,000
back across town where they belong.

89
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,800
Yo, man, we run them off,
we run off the good dope so....

90
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,900
I'm just saying
they all the time hustling around...

91
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,800
cutting prices and doing shit. It ain't right.

92
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,800
Walk, nigger.

93
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,300
Yo, what's up, soldier?

94
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,300
-Looking maybe to do something here.
-With him? This motherfucker?

95
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,200
-Looking maybe to do something here.
-With him? This motherfucker?

96
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,000
I saw him over on Ashland last week
selling burns.

97
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,300
-Fuck y'all, nigger.
-Look, what did he say?

98
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,600
$25, two dimes and a coke kicker.

99
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,100
I'll give you two dimes for $15,
plus the ice on top for free. What?

100
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,600
That'll work.

101
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Take it in the lobby. I'll be right behind you.

102
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,100
That's what's up, see?

103
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,800
The game now is that we gotta sell
more of this good shit than they do.

104
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,200
What? Get the fuck out of here!

105
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,400
You mean to tell me
there's a Westside nigger...

106
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,900
who knows how to sell shit
without sticking a pistol in a fiend's face?

107
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah, dawg. And you better get used to it...

108
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,300
'cause y'all ain't selling shit
until we bone-ass dry.

109
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,500
-Believe that.
-All right, nigger. Whatever, man.

110
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,800
All right, cottage-cheese,
chest-ass motherfucker.

111
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,800
-Where do you want it?
-There's good.

112
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,300
Easy.

113
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,300
-We could help you set it up.
-You have a surveillance to cover?

114
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,800
-I got that feeling again.
-Like they don't think we're potty trained.

115
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,800
-Can I help you?
-FBl. Lt. Daniels?

116
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,800
He's in his office.

117
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,300
Without that billboard in my face,
I wouldn't have known.

118
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,100
How could you have known?

119
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,500
-There was the wingtips.
-And the beady eyes. Definite giveaway.

120
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,500
-Tight asses.
-Definitely.

121
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,300
Lt. Daniels? Agents Settles and Mason.

122
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,900
Maj. Valchek said you'd be expecting us.

123
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,700
You listening to this fool?

124
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,000
Saying that the Eastside
is wilder than Westside...

125
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,300
'cause of some shit
about Eastside folks drinking port wine...

126
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,500
while the Westside do sherry?

127
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Port make a man do crazy shit,
I'm telling you.

128
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,900
-Butchie, talk to this fool.
-For me, leastways...

129
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,400
the difference between East and West
goes back to one man:

130
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,700
-Frank Matthews.
-Pee Wee Matthews?

131
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,800
Yeah, the brother went up New York
and got in bed with them ltalians.

132
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,200
The only one from this town
got a piece of that French Connection.

133
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,300
What the hell Pee Wee
got to do with anything?

134
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,600
'Cause Frank was Westside. How do you
like that? The dope flowed West.

135
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,800
When you got a steady supply,
you run shit like a business.

136
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,500
Somebody gets hurt, there's a reason.
Not like this foolishness we got today.

137
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,900
Excuse me.

138
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,300
What say, Omar?

139
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,700
Ain't no thing.

140
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,000
You know I got something for you, right?
Wouldn't come around unless I did.

141
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,500
What up, Butch?
How you holding up, baby?

142
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,200
Except for fretting on you, I'm good.

143
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,900
It's for my people.

144
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,700
A little something for a rainy day.

145
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,800
You built up a right nice-size nest
these past couple of years.

146
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,800
Might be time you maybe think
about backing off some?

147
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,400
Back off to what?

148
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,000
Later, Butch.

149
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,600
Stay, boy.

150
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,200
Damn, Zig, I ain't got it cut yet.

151
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,700
And turn that shit down, for Christ's sake.

152
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,900
Nicely done.

153
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,100
Like I always say,
it pays to go with a union card every time.

154
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,000
-Turn the fucking radio down, Zig.
-Will you get in the goddamn car already?

155
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,200
For Christ's sake,
we ain't got all night. Jesus!

156
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,900
You could drive a tank through there,
it wouldn't take a scratch.

157
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,400
Where the fuck you going with this?

158
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,900
Greece. Athens, Greece.

159
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,400
The hole is so they don't think
it's an inside job.

160
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,000
So they don't look at the union.

161
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,900
Welcome aboard, chief.

162
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,000
Is that you?

163
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,800
I thought you were gonna go shopping.

164
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,600
-Me?
-Yeah.

165
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,400
We round-the-clock with surveillance.

166
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,700
When do we get to the part
where you do all kind of shit for me?

167
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,000
When do we get to that part?

168
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,000
So you past the point
of lifting a grocery bag or two?

169
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,900
You try being me like this.

170
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,300
Something wrong?

171
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,100
The baby's kicking. Wanna feel?

172
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,600
-Almost $4,000.
-I know it is.

173
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,700
The Greek guy, the one with the warehouse,
pays me in cash.

174
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,400
Keeps it off the books,
so he don't have to pay taxes and benefits.

175
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,300
-And you saved all that?
-He gave me a bump, too.

176
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,800
I'm pulling down $700 a week.

177
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,200
You don't believe me?

178
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,700
Christ.

179
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,800
I was saving that up to give to you
for the new apartment.

180
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
You know what I'm saying, dawg?

181
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,100
But I don't understand how these hoes
be acting sometimes and shit.

182
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,000
If I tell a bitch, I'm like,
"Bitch, either you suck dick or you don't."

183
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,500
-Gentlemen.
-What's up, my brother?

184
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,000
Are you slinging bean pies up in here?
You know what I mean?

185
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,700
You with the nation, homey?
'Cause either you're a Muslim...

186
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,600
or your momma need to stop
laying your clothes out in the morning.

187
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,800
I'm here to represent the interests
of a Mr. Barksdale.

188
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,400
-Are you familiar with Mr. Barksdale?
-That name ring out, but so do mine.

189
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,100
And you are?

190
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,200
Cheese, man.

191
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,200
Mr. Cheese. I see.

192
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,700
-And who do you work for, Mr. Cheese?
-Who do I work for?

193
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,200
Am I correct in assuming that
you are not employed by Mr. Barksdale?

194
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,400
Hell, yeah.

195
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,100
If that is the case,
then I have to insist that you leave.

196
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,600
-This nigger serious?
-Let me be emphatic.

197
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,100
You need to take your black ass
across Charles Street to where it belong.

198
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,000
-What?
-Hold on now.

199
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,100
He don't know what this is. It ain't
what he think, you know what I'm saying?

200
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,500
First of all, we got permission
to grind in these here towers.

201
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,200
Second of all, I don't give a fuck....

202
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,100
Get off me, get off!

203
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,500
Pellets in plastic. Rat shot.

204
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,800
What you need to be concerned about
is what's seated in the chamber now:

205
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,500
a copper-jacketed, hollow point...

206
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,900
1 20-grain hot street load
of my own creation.

207
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,100
So you need to think for just a moment
and ask yourself:

208
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,400
What do I have to do
before this man raise up his gun again?

209
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,100
Let's go.

210
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Good day to you, sir.

211
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm in agreement
with the agents' assessment.

212
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,400
As far as I can see...

213
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,200
this case is an ideal candidate
for RICO prosecution.

214
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,700
My agency agrees RICO is the way to go,
so we'll be in your courthouse, not mine.

215
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,500
But I want one thing on record.

216
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,200
As of 9l1 1,
the Bureau has one priority in this case:

217
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,100
it's waterfront corruption.

218
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,800
It's a new world
and the ports are vulnerable.

219
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,400
This case is bigger than the union.

220
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,000
We're agreeing to take on
the whole case, Lieutenant.

221
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,100
But the union is why
we're in the room with you.

222
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,700
If you're okay with that,
we can work the case together.

223
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,600
We'll copy all the Bureau's 302s
to the Lieutenant and Miss Pearlman.

224
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Your paperwork should CC Squad 6
and my office, as well.

225
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,300
I'll start pumping your casework
into our system.

226
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,900
See what leads that might generate.

227
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,200
Oughtn't you be laid up resting?

228
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,100
A gunshot ain't nothing to trifle with.

229
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,200
Shoulder do hurt.

230
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,300
But this here work just fine.

231
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,200
Tell Stack to polish it up good
and put $7.50 on it.

232
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,200
Shame to let a good toaster get away
over a frayed cord.

233
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
First off, ain't nobody running
up in them projects.

234
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,500
Them Westside boys are hurting over this
more than even you.

235
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,200
Trust me,
soon as our good shit run out, they fucked.

236
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,300
Second, a whole passel of hard-ass hitters...

237
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,100
took a go at Brother Mouzone,
and ain't lived to say shit about it.

238
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,100
We go at the boy,
no telling what might get stirred up.

239
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,900
If Stringer takes a shot,
he crosses Avon on it.

240
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,400
Put a bounty on him.

241
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,100
Let some bushwacking fiend
back-shoot his ass.

242
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,100
I pin money on him,
and first thing he come at me?

243
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,300
Shit. Might as well just shoot myself now
and get it over.

244
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,500
There is one boy
who might could just pull this off.

245
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,100
Only, he won't take contract money.

246
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,600
Aim for center mass.
Make sure the man goes down.

247
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,100
No problem.

248
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,900
I got the three on the left.

249
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,900
Fuck you, assholes.

250
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,800
-How you doing?
-How you doing, buddy?

251
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,100
The Samsung S221 . You got that?

252
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,600
I don't see it.

253
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,700
Doing the old inventory, are we?

254
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,800
I hope there ain't been no thieving going on.

255
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,700
Not like the problem we got
down at the docks.

256
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,700
-You get the cars off?
-Sailed two hours ago on the Caspia.

257
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,700
Listed as scrap aluminum.
I got the bill of lading right here.

258
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,200
Not here.

259
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,000
In my office.

260
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,800
Forgive me, but how am I to know...

261
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,500
you did not ship them empty?

262
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,700
I just don't know. Let me see.

263
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Maybe if I had a 4.0 Megapix,
three time optical, fully digitalized camera...

264
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,900
I could've taken some quality photos
of them Benzes in those cans.

265
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,600
But oops. I forgot my camera got busted.

266
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,600
Or you know what I could do?

267
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,500
I could get old Boris
to skulk around them docks...

268
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,900
keep the old commie red eye
on them containers.

269
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,200
Make sure the dock boys
are playing me straight.

270
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,900
-They are what I order?
-Yes.

271
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,900
I got you the S series
in the colors that you wanted.

272
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,100
I even got one parked outside.
You wanna see?

273
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Outside? Now?

274
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,600
I'm just taking her out for a spin, chief.
I'll put her back tonight.

275
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,900
Wait one.

276
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,400
Them cars list out
at better than $60,000 each.

277
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,100
20% was last week. Today, the quote is 10%.

278
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,700
Still, it's good money for a few hours' work.

279
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,500
No!

280
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,400
No fucking way!
We had a deal, motherfucker. A deal.

281
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,800
You listen to me.

282
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,600
It was my fucking ass out there
on the line. Mine.

283
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,100
This piddling shit
is the best that you come up with?

284
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,700
You don't play me like that. You don't.

285
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,600
Fuck you, you thieving, Greek cunt.

286
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,900
Malaka!

287
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,600
You don't know that one, chief.
But you know "malaka, " yes?

288
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,000
Now you know malaka with dress.

289
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,100
Please.

290
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,400
Malaka.

291
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,000
Can you hear me?

292
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,700
Ifyou can talk, please stay on the line.

293
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,000
Get in the boat first,
then put the preserver on.

294
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,300
-It's easier that way.
-Yeah?

295
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,600
Y'all trying to drown my ass for sure.

296
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,700
-Come on.
-Don't push me, man.

297
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,900
Rod.

298
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Got it.

299
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,300
Here. Hold on to that.

300
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,100
I know this one.

301
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,400
Stringer Bell will come at me with this.

302
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,300
Says he's got something with Omar
he need to make straight.

303
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,400
Didn't say what that might be?

304
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,000
Wouldn't tell me.
And to be truthful, I didn't want to know.

305
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,300
No. It don't feel right.

306
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,300
You know them Barksdale people
ain't to be trusted.

307
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,900
No denying all you say is true.
But Stringer talking parley.

308
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,300
So your boy needs to think
long and hard on this.

309
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,900
'Cause if Omar is living his day-to-day
in the street...

310
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
there ain't no telling what their next step
might be if there ain't no sit-down.

311
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,100
-"Parley"?
-That's all he says he's looking for.

312
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,900
I'll talk to him.

313
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,100
But if it feels funny to him
the way it does to me...

314
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,800
I got a better chance
of putting a leash to the wind, you know?

315
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,400
If you think it might help,
I can go protection.

316
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
-They're the one got hurt the last time.
-Then there was a reason to meet.

317
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,100
-This time feel different.
-I hear you.

318
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Maybe Stringer's still trying
to settle that beef...

319
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,000
behind the fact
that he got to live in this city, too...

320
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,900
Omar being Omar.

321
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,400
If it ain't putting you out none...

322
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,400
I'd feel a powerful lot better
if my nephew took over protection.

323
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,700
Hayward.

324
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,800
Typed and ready for your John Hancock.

325
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,100
-Thanks.
-Sure.

326
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,100
You just have to initial each page
and then sign at the end.

327
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,200
I'm just checking.
This is the official record, right, chief?

328
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,300
It's what's gonna play in court.

329
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,800
Can I change something?

330
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,100
Yeah.

331
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,000
Just put your initials next to your changes.
It's no problem.

332
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,600
Yeah, it's only one.

333
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:42,100
-You know, you typed "said" here, see?
-"Said"?

334
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,000
He wasn't saying, "Please don't shoot me."

335
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,600
It was more begging.

336
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,700
You know? Double G, he's begging me.

337
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,400
But that's not gonna mess you up,
though, right?

338
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,900
No, it's more descriptive like that.
It's good. Thanks.

339
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,200
Quiet. No one in or out of there.

340
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,000
It's kind of nice out here.
Moonlight on the water.

341
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,700
Waves lapping gently against the boat.

342
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,400
I'm working my regular eight.
I can handle it, you know?

343
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,000
But a detail like this....

344
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,000
That's what I'm asking.

345
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,700
If something comes up on the job,
how would you handle it?

346
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,800
I mean, at home with the kids.

347
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,000
Until now, not much came up.

348
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,500
But now, say something comes up.

349
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,300
I mean, say we do a raid or something.
What would you do?

350
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,700
I guess I'd try to get the sitter to stay.

351
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,400
Maybe call my folks, like I did tonight.

352
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,200
You know how it is with kids.
You gotta be there.

353
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,500
But you wouldn't miss it?

354
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,200
I mean, with everybody rolling out
and you having to head home?

355
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,500
If it keeps going like this,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

356
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,900
-Thanks.
-It's no problem.

357
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,000
You wanna make a phone call to someone?

358
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,400
If you get over to Madison,
it might be some time before you can.

359
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,000
Ain't a chance I get a bail, right?

360
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,700
How about family?

361
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,400
All right, to bring you up to speed,
we've got agents in Le Havre...

362
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,400
shagging leads from the manifest
of the Talco ship due here in a few days.

363
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,600
To see if we can't pinpoint the origin
for the illegal containers.

364
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,400
That's a lot of cans.

365
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,000
A hundred and ten, actually.

366
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,300
How many agents you need to track back
to where all those cans came from?

367
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,100
As many as it takes.

368
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,200
We may be assholes, but on the upside,
there's an awful lot of us.

369
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,200
Let me get this into the computer
for the boys overseas.

370
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,400
Anything from that shithole of a diner?

371
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,100
Herc and Carver had nothing overnight.

372
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,400
The feds took over this morning
and it's still quiet.

373
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,600
I'm going back on the water.

374
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,400
One meet and we're on this guy.

375
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,500
The Talco line's in Wednesday.
I'll send Nick for a number.

376
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,700
-The Greeks again?
-Who else?

377
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,200
They sure do stir up the shit,
them Greeks do.

378
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,600
-Uncle Frank.
-Nicky boy, just in time.

379
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,600
-Uncle Frank.
-What? What happened?

380
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,300
-What the fuck is it this time?
-He shot....

381
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,300
They're saying he shot two of the Greeks.

382
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,000
-Last night, they're saying.
-Shot?

383
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,100
-He shot?
-Fucking Christ!

384
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,200
He's locked up.
He's fucking charged with murder.

385
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,500
-The Greeks?
-Double G.

386
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,300
And one of the kids that works
down the store on the avenue with him.

387
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,600
They're saying he walked in there.

388
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,000
-He went in.
-Why was he there?

389
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,100
-Where the fuck were you?
-Uncle Frank, I didn't know.

390
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,700
What didn't you know?

391
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,100
-What is Ziggy doing near the Greeks?
-I don't know.

392
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,200
You don't know? You're supposed to.
You're his fucking cousin!

393
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:10,900
You don't know? You're supposed to.
You're his fucking cousin!

394
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,200
You're his father.

395
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,000
1,1 25 kilograms.

396
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,800
Not that drug enforcement's my cup of tea...

397
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,400
but I'm told
it was the largest crack seizure on record.

398
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,600
I just wish I had good news for you.

399
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,000
You told me this was a local effort.

400
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,600
It's sprawled. Now the Bureau's involved.
We're looking hard at the port unions.

401
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,300
My hands are tied.

402
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,000
They're on you with wiretaps.

403
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,800
Several phones, several addresses.

404
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,000
Stefanos.

405
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,700
Have the boy go to Eton.

406
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,100
Tell him to come right away
to the other place.

407
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,400
-You're not calling?
-No phones. No more phones.

408
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,500
Adieu, my friend.

409
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,600
They forgot your fries.

410
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,100
No, they forgot your fries.

411
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,500
-My fries are right in here.
-Those are my fries.

412
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:58,100
Bitch, everything I say, you hear backwards.
The fries are mine, boy.

413
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,000
Go ahead.

414
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,100
Eat the fries, you fat fuck.
See if I fucking care.

415
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,000
What? You think I'm fat?

416
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,800
There's our boy.

417
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,200
-Lester, Eton's on the move.
-We got it.

418
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,500
-No need for an eyeball follow, right?
-No need.

419
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,200
A fine fucking kettle of fish.

420
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,000
I heard it,
but I had to come see it for myself.

421
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,900
-And sure enough....
-Major?

422
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,000
You know,
I put my faith in you fucking feds.

423
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,600
You let me down.

424
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,200
-Major, we can talk in my office.
-Lieutenant.

425
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,300
It's Lieutenant, right?

426
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,100
I gave you a simple assignment:

427
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,300
that fellow, the one in the corner.

428
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,200
And to make it happen, I gave you all this.

429
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,900
Good digs, people...

430
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,500
everything you needed.

431
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,900
And what did you give me?

432
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,600
Right up the fucking ass, Lieutenant.

433
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,200
-Major, you're going to get--
-Roland, get your shit.

434
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,600
You want to do it your way, fine.

435
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,700
But you ain't gonna use my people
to fuck me.

436
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,700
-Get your gear. I'm pulling you.
-I got.... There's work....

437
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,600
-You said--
-Get your narrow ass back to the district...

438
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,500
before I slap you with insubordination.

439
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,800
Move, shitbird!

440
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,700
Jesus!

441
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,300
Detective, my office.

442
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,300
Base to 1 1-34.
Target number two is coming at your 20.

443
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,700
Copy that. We're on it good.

444
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,700
We're on the Boss.

445
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,900
My God.

446
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,800
-He shoots both?
-He kills George, right there in the store.

447
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,400
-Leaves the boy to bleed.
-For what?

448
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,600
An argument over a few cars?

449
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,100
-That little Polack?
-He's crazy, that one.

450
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,000
The police have him now.

451
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,300
The police still there?

452
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,700
Go to the store.

453
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,000
Whatever the police did not take,
papers, pictures, everything...

454
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,800
you clean it up.

455
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,400
The warehouse, too.
Everything gets clean now.

456
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,600
Everything.

457
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,100
And the phones are dead.

458
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,800
Did you see that?
They just threw the phones.

459
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
1 1-34 to Surveillance.

460
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,300
-Standing by.
-We got our man.

461
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,100
Target number one
is a white male, 40s, short...

462
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,000
wearing a tan shirt and a gray tam.

463
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,700
Copy your description.

464
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,700
1 1-34 to Surveillance,
both targets are on the move.

465
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,400
We can't make the vehicle from here,
but you sure can.

466
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,500
Copy.

467
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,200
What was he doing
with that thing in his hand?

468
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,000
Same thing you always do.

469
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,200
Probably sending a text message.
My kids are crazy over that.

470
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,500
That's our guy, right?

471
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,200
What's his face Sobotka
from the drug corner?

472
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,900
I need to get with Vondas.

473
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,900
Who's that?

474
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,400
Spiros. Where is he?

475
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,400
I don't know no Spiros.

476
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,500
-No shit.
-He just up and clocked him?

477
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,900
-Daniels had everybody write what they saw.
-Even us suits.

478
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,100
That was smart. Daniels is sharp.

479
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,900
-Where's Prez now?
-Daniels took him home.

480
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,100
-I don't think he'll come back to this detail.
-You never know.

481
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,700
He might have one of those psychological
bullshit things in his jacket...

482
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,100
gives him immunity or something.

483
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,000
Valchek gave him immunity,
and he just put Valchek on his ass.

484
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,700
-Nothing since the Fort Howard meet.
-They're definitely dumping phones.

485
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:24,000
When you use a cell phone and
press "send," where does the call go to?

486
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,800
-Why are you asking?
-The Boss Man at Fort Howard.

487
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,200
He tosses the cell phone we're up on, right?

488
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,100
Then he pulls out another thingamajig,
and he types a message.

489
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,700
Text messaging.

490
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,000
It starts at one of those towers
they got up all over the place, right?

491
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,800
And ends up in a computer
at a wireless provider.

492
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,200
If you knew when the call was made,
could you trace the call back to that tower?

493
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,900
'Cause if you could,
mightn't you get a phone number?

494
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,500
You get that,
then you got the billing details, right?

495
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,700
Fool, do you have any idea
how many people use cell phones?

496
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,300
There must be thousands,
hundreds of thousands at any time.

497
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,700
What you need is another variable.

498
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,000
Another bit of data that's gonna help you
isolate your call from all the others.

499
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:10,300
What if you knew where the call was made?
I mean, exactly where it was made.

500
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,900
We were out in the middle of nowhere.
Does that help narrow it down?

501
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,300
The Fort Howard sea wall. It ain't exactly
Charles and Baltimore Streets.

502
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,600
You've got another problem.
Which wireless company?

503
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:26,800
There must be Verizon, MCl, AT&T, Sprint....

504
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,100
Shit, tin cans and a string.
You got dozens of them.

505
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,900
Lamar?

506
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,200
-Where's my Harper's?
-Say what?

507
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,900
Harper's. The new issue.

508
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,100
You didn't say that one.
You said The New Republic and Atlantic...

509
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,300
-and a new something else.
-I did not forget to tell you Harper's.

510
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,900
Every week I tell you the same shit,
and every week you forget half of what I say.

511
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,600
Tomorrow, first thing, you go
to the newsstand and you get Harper's.

512
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,200
And The Nation, too,
which you also managed to forget.

513
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,400
You know what the most dangerous thing
in America is, right?

514
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,600
A nigger with a library card.

515
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,600
All damn day, he just sit there reading.

516
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,700
And damned if them Eastside bitches
don't stay away.

517
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,600
-That's real muscle, right there.
-True that.

518
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,300
What are we gonna do
when we start running out of good product?

519
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,700
That's what we need to ask ourselves.

520
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,300
Yo, Bodie,
if Stringer want the Eastside up in here...

521
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,600
then why Barksdale got a man
running them off?

522
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,800
This is getting us nowhere.
We got nothing under Pyramid lnc...

523
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,500
or any of the targets
at any other cellular company.

524
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,100
It's on McNulty then.

525
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,000
11-35, you got the 20?

526
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,000
-I'm on the spot right now.
-Go.

527
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:09,100
10-4. Latitude first:
North, 39 degrees. 1 1 .727.

528
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,700
Longitude: West, 76 degrees. 26.628.

529
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,100
Now, this was a neat trick.
No one ever did it before.

530
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,300
Identified a cell phone using time and GPS.

531
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,200
We got everything on the phone
that was text messaging...

532
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,200
from those coordinates at 04:45 p.m. today.

533
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,200
Just a subpoena?

534
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,000
With this, you can get account information
and a phone number.

535
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,700
With a search warrant...

536
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,400
you can get two months of text messages.

537
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,100
You got two months of text messages
in this file?

538
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,300
I do, if you've got a warrant.

539
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,600
Tell you what, friend.

540
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,900
We're gonna go back and
start typing that warrant tomorrow morning.

541
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,400
But right now,
we wouldn't mind taking a peek...

542
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,900
at what my man's been up to
in the last 24 hours.

543
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,800
Exigent circumstances.

544
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,700
Thanks, brother.

545
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,000
Fuck me.

546
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,200
Nothing's easy.

547
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,600
-What's up?
-They've dumped their phones.

548
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,500
We're trying to get onto
the Boss Man's text messaging.

549
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,400
They sent that Greek mess over as email.

550
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,100
After he inputs,
the computer will translate it.

551
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,200
Got it.

552
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,700
Shit.

553
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,500
Hey, Prissy.

554
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,100
Thought you'd be here.

555
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,000
Fucking Ziggy.

556
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,000
When didn't he do dumb shit?

557
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,300
Remember when he forged
that Age of Majority card?

558
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,700
We all pooled our money.

559
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,600
You drove us over Brooklyn Park
to the cut-rate.

560
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,800
My mom's puke-yellow Chevy.

561
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,900
We told him specifically:

562
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,500
two bottles of Pikesville Rye and....

563
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,200
Southern Comfort for me.

564
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,100
What did fucknuts get?

565
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,000
Fucking Boone's Farm.

566
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,500
He said that's what the college kids drank.

567
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,000
But we did it up. Right here.

568
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,000
He stood up there, a bottle in each hand...

569
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,200
screaming loud enough to wake the nuns.

570
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,400
What the fuck did he say?

571
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,000
"College kids ain't shit!"

572
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,400
Goddamn, Zig.

573
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,200
-Yeah?
-Beadie, it's Kima.

574
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,600
We're gonna take the Boss out.

575
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,700
-Raids? Tonight?
-You got somewhere to drop the kids off?

576
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,300
No, no problem.
I can take them over to my parents'.

577
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,700
All right, we'll see you soon.

578
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,000
Kima, thanks for the call. Bye.

579
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,600
The judge wants to know how much longer.

580
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,900
We're close.

581
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,800
Dump this row. Dump the computer.
Dump this.

582

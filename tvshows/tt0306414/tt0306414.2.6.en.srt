2
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,789
Ain't workin' out
for y'all, huh?

3
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:25,259
Mars is the god
of war, right?

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,929
- Planet, too.
- I know it's a planet.

5
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,266
But the clue is
"Greek god of war."

6
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,734
"Ares."

7
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:36,970
Greeks called him
Ares.

8
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:39,640
Same dude,
different name is all.

9
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,577
"Ares" fits.
Thanks.

10
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,679
It's all good.

11
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,149
See, back in
middle school and all,
I used to love them myths.

12
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:52,220
That stuff was deep.
Truly.

13
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,157
You're up.

14
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,602
Nathan:
State calls Omar Little,
Your Honor.

15
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,207
Faggot.

16
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,317
Bailiff:
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth,

17
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,354
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

18
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:28,456
I surely do.

19
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:31,091
State your name
for the record.

20
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,294
Omar Devon Little.

21
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:35,196
Mr. Little,
how old are you?

22
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,165
About 29,
thereabout.

23
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,167
And where
do you live?

24
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:40,634
No place in
particular, ma'am.

25
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,703
You're homeless?

26
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,172
In the wind,
so to speak.

27
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:47,074
And what is
your occupation?

28
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:48,742
Occupation?

29
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:52,613
What exactly do you do
for a living, Mr. Little?

30
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,048
I rip and run.

31
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:56,584
You...

32
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,286
I robs drug dealers.

33
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:00,288
( spectators murmuring )

34
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,357
And exactly
how long

35
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,260
has this been
your occupation,
Mr. Little?

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,329
I don't know, exactly.

37
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,132
I venture to say maybe
about eight or nine years.

38
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,402
Mr. Little, how does
a man rob drug dealers

39
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:18,172
for eight or nine years
and live to tell about it?

40
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:26,714
Day at a time,
I suppose.

41
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,217
( theme music playing )

42
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:36,490
* When you walk
through the garden *

43
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,593
* You gotta
watch your back *

44
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:44,232
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

45
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:48,336
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

46
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:51,705
* If you walk with Jesus

47
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,608
* He's gonna
save your soul *

48
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,979
* You gotta
keep the devil *

49
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:03,217
* Way down
in the hole *

50
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:07,288
* He's got the fire
and the fury *

51
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:11,191
* At his command

52
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:14,328
* Well, you don't
have to worry *

53
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:18,532
* If you hold onto
Jesus' hand *

54
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:19,900
* We'll all be safe
from Satan *

55
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:25,573
* When the thunder rolls

56
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:26,907
* We just gotta
keep the devil *

57
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,613
* Way down
in the hole... *

58
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,685
- ( siren wails )
- ( glass cracks )

59
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,824
* Down in the hole

60
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,328
* Down in the hole

61
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:53,901
* You gotta help me
keep the devil *

62
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,270
* Down in the hole.

63
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,044
What do we know?

64
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,513
On Sobotka,
very little.

65
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,415
He seems to live
within his means.

66
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:10,918
House in Glen Burnie,
paid-off truck,
modest savings,

67
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,086
credit history
is okay.

68
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,323
There's no flash to him,
nothing dramatic.

69
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,224
Doesn't sound much
like a money man to me.

70
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:19,293
Or maybe
he's hiding it.

71
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,228
The union is also
a little threadbare.

72
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,731
They paid the taxes on
Union Hall almost a year late

73
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,133
and that was only after
they got hit with liens.

74
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,735
Looking at
their books...

75
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:30,571
- You subpoenaed their books?
- You don't need to.

76
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,673
I.B.S. books are open
to the Justice Department

77
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,742
under the terms of
a federal racketeering case

78
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,844
that came out of New York
five years ago.

79
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,746
We just called Washington,
they sent us a copy

80
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,814
of everything
the Baltimore locals
have filed.

81
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:44,217
The books show that there's
less than 100 checkers

82
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,487
still paying dues
to 15-14.

83
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:49,390
And that's down from
about 300 in the '70s.

84
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,024
They're hurting.

85
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,160
So where's all this money
that Valchek is talkin' about?

86
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,664
The I.B.S. hired
Bruce DiBiago to lobby
Annapolis this session.

87
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,367
And through
individual officers
and union members,

88
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:02,370
they've paid about
70,000 to various PACs

89
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,339
and Democratic organizations
in the last eight months.

90
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,007
They show any of that
on their books?

91
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,510
No, we pieced that together
from the campaign finance
reports.

92
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,812
And that's just what was in
the names of the union officers

93
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,113
that we cross-referenced.

94
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,182
So, where's the cash
coming from?

95
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,884
Drugs?

96
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:21,121
So far, D.N.R.'s
on the union hall phones
don't show much.

97
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,525
Union business
and personal calls,
but no beepers.

98
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:28,462
And not much
in the way of cell numbers
or payphones either.

99
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,263
What's with those hand-to-hands,
anything connect?

100
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,533
We're buyin' from
a lotta white boys.

101
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:36,303
O'Donnell Heights, Greektown,
Highlandtown above the park.

102
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,038
But any port connections
feel random.

103
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,675
Well, the money
comes from somewhere.

104
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:45,613
Maybe it's what
the checkers do.

105
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:48,048
I mean, they monitor what
comes in and out of the port.

106
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,086
That's what they do,
that's their value.

107
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,288
They're bringing
the shit in?

108
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,290
Or they're
letting it happen.

109
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,693
Like that can
full of dead girls.

110
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,862
They kept that
outta the computer.

111
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,597
Daniels:
Which is why
we're gonna quietly

112
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,065
do some work
on that side of things.

113
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,701
Kima, Prez,

114
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,237
I want you to start
lookin' at girls.

115
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,573
No problem.

116
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,275
If they're coming
into Baltimore,
who's workin' them?

117
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,844
Are they club dancing,
whoring?

118
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,780
We need to plug
into that circuit.

119
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,450
As for the rest of you,
Lester is gonna stay

120
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,851
with the paper trail
and with the D.N.R.'s,

121
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,454
looking for connections
to the union money.

122
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,288
Herc and Carver,
you guys keep workin'

123
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,791
the drug corners
near the port.

124
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,594
Officer Russell here
and Bunk Moreland are
assigned to Homicide,

125
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,763
but for the time being
they'll be with us,

126
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,465
running the port database
through a computer,

127
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:40,067
looking for any pattern
involving contraband.

128
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,102
Questions?

129
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,482
Excuse me?

130
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,817
- I'm Thomas.
- Beadie.

131
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,952
Would you like to go
to Royal Farms,

132
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,921
maybe get
a cup of coffee?

133
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,858
Right.

134
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,062
Yo.
"I'm Thomas.

135
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,698
You want
a coffee?"

136
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,700
Hey, listen, I was gonna
ask her for her panties

137
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,635
to make some soup with,

138
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:17,204
but I was afraid
she'd take it the wrong way.

139
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,309
Nathan:
So you're saying you
were at the opposite end

140
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,512
of the parking lot when
the assailant drew his gun?

141
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,013
Little:
Thereabout.

142
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,415
And do you see the gunman
who killed Mr. Gant

143
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:29,750
anywhere in
the courtroom today?

144
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,720
Hey, yo,
what up, Bird?

145
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,788
Nathan:
For the record,
you are identifying

146
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,456
the defendant,
Marquis Hilton.

147
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,959
It's just
"Bird" to me.

148
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,796
And Mr. Little,
you had seen him many
times before, had you not?

149
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,665
Yeah, we jailed together
down the cut--

150
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,601
Objection, Your Honor.
May we approach?

151
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:55,242
Quite a witness,
ain't he?

152
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,380
Word on the street
is Omar ain't

153
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,083
nowhere near them rises
when the shit pop.

154
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,086
Street said
little cocksucker
was on the east side,

155
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,421
stickin' up some
Ashland Avenue niggers.

156
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:12,826
That's the word
on the street, huh?

157
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,563
Trouble is, String,
we ain't on the street.

158
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:18,265
We in
a court of law.

159
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,467
Your Honor--

160
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:24,371
Objection is noted
and preserved for the record,
Mr. Levy. Move on.

161
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,006
Thank you,
Your Honor.

162
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,042
Jurors will disregard that
last comment from the witness,

163
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,510
in which he explained

164
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:33,246
where he had last
encountered the defendant.

165
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,248
Yes or no,
Mr. Little?

166
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,185
Prior to the shooting,
did you know the defendant?

167
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,053
I mean,
I knew the man,

168
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,989
but wasn't like he was
no friend or nothin'.

169
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,592
So you would have
no trouble recognizing him

170
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,359
from a moderate
distance,

171
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,462
say 20, 25 yards,
in daylight?

172
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:50,864
Aw, naw,
no problem.

173
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,232
Mr. Little,
do you recognize

174
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,604
this particular
weapon?

175
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,505
Yeah, that's Bird's gun,
the 380.

176
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:01,174
- You've seen it before?
- Bird always flashin'
that thing.

177
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,410
So you'd actually seen it
before the day in question.

178
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,713
And on the day
in question?

179
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:09,182
It was in
Bird's hand.

180
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,250
When he shot
at Mr. Gant?

181
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,486
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,255
Bird covet them
shiny little pistols.

183
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,025
Objection,
Your Honor.

184
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,760
And the boy too triflin'
to throw it off

185
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,595
even after
a daytime murder.

186
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,163
You're a lyin'
cocksucker, man!

187
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,998
I'll rip your heart out
your goddamn chest.

188
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,267
Judge:
The defendant
will regain control

189
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,869
or he will be
forcibly restrained

190
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,638
and I will
clear the court.

191
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:33,373
The witness's last answer
is to be stricken

192
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,175
and disregarded
by the jury.

193
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,348
Niko.

194
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,986
Eton is
my friend.

195
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,189
It's good to have
friends meet, no?

196
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,659
Eton, huh?

197
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,161
That's from the Greek,
meanin' what?

198
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,864
No Greek.
Israeli.

199
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:59,566
Oh, yeah?

200
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:03,403
'Cause you look Greek.
I mean, no offense.

201
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,939
- Either way, I mean.
- ( chuckles )

202
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,814
You have
the chemicals?

203
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:16,149
I can get 'em,
as much as you want.

204
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:18,952
When?

205
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,620
I was gonna do
something this week,

206
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,956
but there's been
a problem though.

207
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,391
What problem?

208
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:27,127
My cousin, Ziggy.

209
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,030
He got into a beef with
these East Baltimore guys.

210
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,033
Drug dealer by the name
of Cheese took his car,
burned it,

211
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,303
now he's sayin'
he's gonna dust Zig
if he doesn't pay.

212
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,438
( speaking Greek )

213
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:39,973
Yeah, "malaka,"
right.

214
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,341
Zig fucked up
the package.

215
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,546
So, you bring us
the chemicals, we pay.

216
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,082
Then you
pay your debt.

217
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:55,188
It was $2,700,
right?

218
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,624
Now, this asshole
is sayin' it's double.

219
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,626
54, you believe that?

220
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,294
First he takes
the car,

221
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,463
and now he's jackin' us
around on the money.

222
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,933
You want,
we kill him.

223
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,035
No.

224
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,270
That ain't it
either, no.

225
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,172
Why not?

226
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,674
'Cause first of all,
Zig fucked it up.

227
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,877
He owes 27.

228
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,546
And second,
you kill Cheese

229
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,182
and we're
gonna have a fight
with his people, right?

230
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,684
A year down the road,
some nigger sees my cousin

231
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,486
comin' out
the burger shop,

232
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,955
puttin' gas in his car
on Central Avenue--

233
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,689
no questions,
puts a cap in his ass.

234
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,759
He's smart, eh?

235
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,194
Niko, smart.

236
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,166
Look...

237
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,601
we don't have the muscle
to go talk to this guy,

238
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,871
make things right.

239
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,139
I was hoping
maybe you do.

240
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:52,645
Mr. Little...

241
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,448
can I ask why you came
forward in this case?

242
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,951
I told the police
what I know.

243
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,287
Were you offered
anything in exchange?

244
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,790
Like what?

245
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,457
Were you arrested?

246
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,127
Were you going to be
charged with a crime
and by testifying,

247
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,998
did the police agree
to drop those charges?

248
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,100
Naw, man, it ain't
even about that.

249
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,402
How many times have
you been arrested

250
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,404
as an adult,
Mr. Little?

251
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:18,438
Shoot, I done
lost count.

252
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,775
Enough though not
to take it personal.

253
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,544
Possession
of a handgun,

254
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,346
possessing
a concealed weapon,

255
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:30,083
assault by pointing,
robbery, deadly weapon,

256
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,152
possession of
a handgun again,

257
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,122
followed by violation
of parole on weapon charges,

258
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,391
followed by one count
of attempted murder

259
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,428
and use of a handgun
in commission of a felony.

260
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:44,064
That wasn't
no attempt murder.

261
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,067
What was it,
Mr. Little?

262
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,937
I shot the boy Mike-Mike
in his hindparts, that all.

263
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,104
( jury chuckling )

264
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:54,041
Fixed it so he
couldn't sit right.

265
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:57,377
Why'd you shoot
Mike-Mike in his...

266
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,478
his hindparts,
Mr. Little?

267
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,648
Let's say we had
a disagreement.

268
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,083
A disagreement
over...?

269
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,584
Well, you see, Mike-Mike
thought he should keep

270
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,119
that cocaine
he was slinging,

271
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,755
and the money he was
makin' from slingin' it.

272
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,958
I thought otherwise.

273
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,494
So you rob
drug dealers.

274
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,464
This is what you do?

275
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:18,999
Yes, sir.

276
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:22,135
You walk the streets
of Baltimore, with a gun,

277
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,504
taking what you want,
when you want it,

278
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,540
willing to use violence
when your demands aren't met.

279
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,944
This is
who you are.

280
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,613
Why should we believe
your testimony then?

281
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,615
Why believe
anything you say?

282
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,985
That's up to y'all,
really.

283
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:41,221
You say you aren't
here testifying against
the defendant

284
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,390
because of any deal
you made with police.

285
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,058
True that.

286
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,627
That you are here because
you want to tell the truth

287
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,996
about what happened
to Mr. Gant

288
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:50,763
in that housing project
parking lot.

289
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,599
Yep.

290
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,435
When in fact you
are exactly the kind
of person who would,

291
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,137
if you felt
you needed to,

292
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,272
shoot a man down
on a housing project
parking lot,

293
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,108
and then lie to the police
about it, would you not?

294
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:05,178
Hey, look, I ain't never
put my gun on no citizen.

295
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,616
You are amoral,
are you not?

296
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,018
You are feeding
off the violence

297
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:12,920
and the despair
of the drug trade.

298
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,222
You're stealing from
those who themselves

299
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,324
are stealing
the lifeblood
from our city.

300
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,592
You are a parasite
who leeches off...

301
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,661
- Just like you, man.
- ...the culture of drugs--

302
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,663
excuse me, what...?

303
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,799
I got the shotgun.

304
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,769
You got
the briefcase.

305
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,639
It's all in the game,
though, right?

306
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,178
And with the economy
what it is,

307
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,813
you can really consider
coming in 10 or 20%

308
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,282
below asking and
still feel competitive.

309
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,917
Even on the Hamburg Street.
address?

310
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,485
Absolutely.

311
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:48,088
Woman:
I have to admit,
I like the house at 1501,

312
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,690
although I didn't like
the color of the whirlpool tub

313
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,225
in the master suite
bathroom.

314
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,760
- Magenta?
- Oh, that's cosmetic.

315
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,662
If they want
to make the sale,

316
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:58,698
they should at least
have some amount of couth
to change the color.

317
00:14:58,798 --> 00:14:59,799
I know it's such
a tiny point to harp on.

318
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,568
Well...

319
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:05,072
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we should
just keep looking.

320
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,773
We shouldn't settle
for just anything.

321
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,708
And you think
there'll be some

322
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:11,378
new open houses
this Sunday?

323
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,046
I'm sorry,
what were you saying?

324
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,414
We think we're
gonna keep looking.

325
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,249
You'll take us around
again on Sunday?

326
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,717
Oh, definitely.

327
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,420
Okay then,
see you Sunday, early.

328
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,621
Great.

329
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,090
( phone ringing )

330
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,358
Elena:
Thank you.

331
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,395
I'll see you then.

332
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,434
You are a child,
you know that?

333
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,868
What do you want?

334
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,470
Dinner
and a movie.

335
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,406
C'mon, stop it.

336
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:42,575
- Why not?
- This isn't going
anywhere, Jimmy.

337
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,611
Dinner and a movie.
Then I'll walk you
to the door,

338
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,446
you shake my hand
and tell me to go
fuck myself,

339
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,148
like you should've
done way back when.

340
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:51,284
How 'bout I tell you to
fuck yourself here and now

341
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,620
and then you can save
that money for someone else?

342
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,887
Come on, Elena.

343
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,956
Come on, I signed
all your damn papers.

344
00:15:57,057 --> 00:16:00,127
Gimme another shot.

345
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,795
Friday.

346
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,998
You pay
for the sitter.

347
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,910
So how that
D.C. game, man?

348
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,113
Same as it ever was.

349
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,016
Chocolate City.
I ain't been there
in a while.

350
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,185
Call it "Drama City"
nowadays.

351
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:29,689
Otherwise,
same ol' go-go,
same ol' bamas.

352
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,458
Same soup,

353
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,493
just reheated,
know what I'm sayin'?

354
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,195
If you need anything
to make this happen,

355
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,929
you gotta get it
yourself.

356
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,166
I can't go
through my people.

357
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:42,469
If Stringer Bell
reachin' all the way
past Baltimore

358
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:43,970
with this kinda work,

359
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:46,673
then we got a real mystery
going on, don't we?

360
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:47,707
Don't worry,
no mistakes.

361
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,079
Nothin' that might
come back on ya.

362
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,081
You sure of
your people?

363
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,783
My cousin up in there,
he on it.

364
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,485
All right.

365
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:02,089
I can't stand that
go-go shit, anyhow.

366
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,624
Ain't heard it
live, then.

367
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,294
I know a club in Oxen Hill
that would wreck y'all.

368
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,396
A'ight.

369
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,333
If I'm 'round the way.

370
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,769
So, how you doin'?

371
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,106
Nursing school,
right now.

372
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,307
Good, that's good.

373
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,442
Lester's been
pushing me, you know.

374
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,379
He does it kinda
without you knowin'
that he's doin' it.

375
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,115
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

376
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,217
So anyway, he said
that you would be by today

377
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:31,651
to talk about
the clubs.

378
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:32,752
About some girls,
Russian.

379
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:35,255
Or from that part
of the world.

380
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,956
The ones on
the circuit, yeah.

381
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,360
You should try this place
called "Nightshift" down
off of Holabird.

382
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,794
I have a friend
who works there

383
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,264
and she worked with a bunch
of Russian girls last year

384
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,899
- for about three months.
- Think she'll talk to me?

385
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,068
Only if I ask her.

386
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,871
Thank you, Detective,
nothing further.

387
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,906
Anything more on redirect,
Ms. Nathan?

388
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,575
No, Your Honor.

389
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,178
Let's take 10 minutes and then
run the closing arguments.

390
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,880
I have every intention
of beginning tomorrow
with jury instructions.

391
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,682
( raps )

392
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,287
How'd Omar do?

393
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:10,056
- You didn't see it?
- Not the cross.

394
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:12,725
That bad?

395
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,730
- ( thumps )
- ( rap music playing )

396
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,214
You have no problem.

397
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:09,148
Nick:
No?

398
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,650
To start, he wants you
to pay 54.

399
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,852
Then we talk.
He says no, you pay
just the 27.

400
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:17,224
Yeah, I saw
how you "talked."

401
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,392
But you will not
pay the 27.

402
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,695
Instead you will get
the money for the car
that burned.

403
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:26,165
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

404
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:27,734
Him, we don't know.

405
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,101
But the one
he calls boss...

406
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,371
him we know.

407
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,409
( TV tuning )

408
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,880
You gonna sit there
and pout?

409
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,885
I know you don't think
I'm going down to that club

410
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,520
just to look at pussy.

411
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,823
I know you know me
better than that.

412
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:55,127
I ain't even lookin'.

413
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:57,063
Everybody's lookin'.

414
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,131
Most of them
women are dykes.

415
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,667
Cheryl,
it's police work.

416
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,702
What, so that's supposed
to make me feel better?

417
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:06,205
Kima's out on the street,
doin' her detective thing?

418
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,909
All that hospital shit,
all that rehab,

419
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,146
all them promises--

420
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:17,049
- We talked about this.
- No, you talked.

421
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,520
I didn't get
a word in edgewise
once you made up your mind.

422
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,399
( TV off )

423
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,167
Where you goin'?

424
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:36,736
With you.

425
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,905
- Excuse me?
- Who knows?

426
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:42,975
I might see
a little something
I happen to like.

427
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,477
So all of that's
on the table?

428
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,878
Right now, there's money
in the transpo budget

429
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,280
for the grain pier.

430
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,248
Also, a bond issue that pays
for maintenance dredging

431
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,717
on the main
shipping channel.

432
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,920
- Ott: But not the canal?
- Nope, not the canal.

433
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,588
For that we're gonna have
to fight a little longer

434
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:58,325
- and dig a little deeper.
- So says Frank.

435
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,726
I gotta say
for my money,

436
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,394
we lucky if we pull
out the grain pier.

437
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:02,762
Be that as it may,

438
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,564
we spent the money
and took our best shot.

439
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:07,600
Hired a couple lobbyists,
made some smart contributions,

440
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,836
paid for a consultant's
report to argue

441
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,538
against some of
the environmental stuff.

442
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:13,940
It cost, but we're
startin' to see it.

443
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,342
So where y'all find
the cash?

444
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,344
I been robbin'
liquor stores, two a week.

445
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,879
- ( laughing )
- Seriously.

446
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,148
Seriously,
we got some help from
the national office on this,

447
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:23,650
and there been
some timely donations

448
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,418
from a few friends
here and there.

449
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,720
The point is,
at the very least,

450
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,022
we're likely
to see the grain pier
back up by next year,

451
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,591
which means maybe
a couple hundred

452
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,393
more ships a year,
at least.

453
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,261
- If...
- And it's a big
fuckin' if...

454
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:36,896
If that Polack
motherfucker--

455
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,230
Whoa, whoa!

456
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,766
Hey, hey, hey,
no offense.

457
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:41,668
If Krawczyk don't
fuck us by throwin' up

458
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:43,536
waterfront condominiums
first, right?

459
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,904
Nat's right.
The back door threat

460
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:47,139
is that Andy Kraw
or some other developer

461
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,577
gets enough last-minute votes
to sink the rehab money
for the grain pier.

462
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,712
'Cause those guys are lookin'
at that location, too.

463
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,047
So we need everybody
makin' phone calls,

464
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,950
let your legislators know
that we watching on this.

465
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:02,254
The money only goes so far.
Now, we gotta make some
noise, right?

466
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:04,824
- Make some noise!
- Frank: Okay, enough talk.

467
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,693
Some of you's got ships
to work in the morning.

468
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:08,461
The rest of you's
need to be drunk.

469
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:10,663
I'll drink to that.

470
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:20,540
"Help from the
national office," huh?

471
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,142
"Timely donations
from friends"?

472
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:25,712
Watch your ass, Frank.

473
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:32,051
- This is it?
- Uh, yeah.

474
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:34,286
Bunk:
Just picked it up from
the port administrator.

475
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:35,555
So what am I
looking at?

476
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:37,490
The Atlantic Light
on the day the can

477
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,691
with the women
was off-loaded.

478
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,059
The boxes
are containers.

479
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,597
This one's being off-loaded
and set on a chassis.

480
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,066
Here's the time--
10:31 hours.

481
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:51,671
See?
It was moved to lane "L",
stack six, row three,

482
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:53,072
by an R.T.G.
at 10:37 hours.

483
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,711
- "R.T.G."?
- Rubber tire gantry.

484
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:01,714
So from ship to stack
took six minutes.

485
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:04,484
That's the way it's
supposed to work, but...

486
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:06,753
A-Q-Q-Z, as in zebra,

487
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,688
three, nine,
six, five...

488
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:12,892
nine, four.
Check digit, seven.

489
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,495
Bunk:
That's the container number of
the can with the women in it.

490
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,597
See that?
It was never entered
by the checker.

491
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:20,232
So as far as
the computer is concerned,
it no longer exists.

492
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,769
Sobotka says that
that can happen

493
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,871
when the radio waves
get knocked down

494
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:27,139
or when a checker inputs
a bad serial number.

495
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,478
Russell:
It came off the Atlantic Light
at 11:26 hours.

496
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,480
And doesn't show up
in the computer again

497
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,347
until 15:12 hours.

498
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,950
I find it
two hours after that.

499
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,220
So for nearly four hours
it's out on the docks,

500
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,855
unaccounted for.

501
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:45,124
Sobotka says cans
get lost all the time.

502
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,694
When they get found,
they get put back
into the computer.

503
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:50,863
- You believe him?
- Humph.

504
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:53,432
No, not this can.

505
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,568
So what's the plan?

506
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:58,505
The database on this computer
has records for every ship

507
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:01,440
that berthed at Patapsco
over the last two years.

508
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:04,143
We gotta go back through
and find what other cans

509
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,945
might've disappeared
like that.

510
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,146
See if there's
a pattern.

511
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:09,181
How many ships
we talking about?

512
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,752
Hundreds.

513
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:18,658
It ain't like I got
a prayer of bringin' this
case in otherwise.

514
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:21,127
( music playing )

515
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:26,533
- Kima: That's what
I'm talkin' about.
- Cheryl: All right.

516
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,968
- What the hell
is your problem?
- Prez: Nothin'.

517
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:32,271
Yeah? You look like
you about to be sick
or somethin'.

518
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,974
I just can't
look at 'em.

519
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:38,477
Prez, you ain't never
been to a titty bar?

520
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:42,414
Yeah, sure.
But not with women.

521
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:44,917
You're sure you're not
gonna have a problem
for talkin' to us here?

522
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,653
I don't give a shit.

523
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:48,755
You friends
with Shardene,
all that matters.

524
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,524
'Sides, I'm from Westport,
and I told them club owners

525
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,760
straight-up, I was here
before them ho's got here,

526
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,828
and they better make sure
I'm here after they leave.

527
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,565
So how long ago
did they come through?

528
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,900
Six months back
was the last batch.

529
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,134
Russians, I think.

530
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,736
But shit all
sound the same

531
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,572
when you
can't understand
a damn word, right?

532
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,173
Who brought 'em?

533
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:09,542
Club owner pays
extra for 'em.

534
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:10,977
There was a woman--

535
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:12,779
she was like the madam,
who handled the cash.

536
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:14,313
But I ain't get
a name.

537
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:15,548
She Russian, too?

538
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:17,216
She was somethin'.
She had an accent.

539
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,688
So it's like, one day,
all Baltimore girls

540
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:24,023
are at the bar,
and the next, what?

541
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,693
- All foreign girls?
- Mm-hmm. That 'bout right.

542
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,728
They was makin' so much money
with them new girls

543
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:31,097
they start lettin' some
of their regular dancers go.

544
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,600
Not me, 'cause, I mean,
I got clientele here.

545
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,101
But some of the others.

546
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,736
Where'd the girls stay?

547
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:39,939
Where they told.
Shit, they ain't here
legally.

548
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,274
They don't know shit.
They ain't got no family.

549
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,077
The men
they got handlin' them
are always with 'em.

550
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:47,680
Right there to take
them from whatever
motel they using

551
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,115
to the club and back.

552
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,083
Right there when
they need to go get food,

553
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:52,484
or go to
the Rite Aid.

554
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:54,020
Right outside
the fuckin' motel door,

555
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,688
when they up there
in the motel rooms
with the johns.

556
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:56,989
Anyone try
to get away?

557
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:00,326
Shit, I seen one
of 'em get lit up

558
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:01,728
with one of
them stun guns

559
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:03,029
just for going
down the block
to get some dinner.

560
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:04,897
I mean, they barely
let them girls

561
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,799
go to the bathroom
by themselves.

562
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,068
And if they see one gettin'
too close to the johns,

563
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:11,871
that's when they move
the whole crew to another
town, you know?

564
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:15,341
Keep it so they don't
get no help.

565
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:18,110
You up after
the next song.

566
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,646
Push my numbers then.

567
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,247
I gotta go
get paid, honey.

568
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:22,514
You need anything else,

569
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:25,317
you can call me.
Help if I can.

570
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,787
I'll tell Shardene
you said hi.

571
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:29,288
Ooh, she must be
doin' good, huh,

572
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:31,824
to be out
for so long?

573
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,260
She must've landed
a rich one, right?

574
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,163
You her girl?

575
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,931
Yeah.

576
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,801
Hm. I wouldn't
let mine come in here
either without me.

577
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:45,137
These bitches in here,
are no joke.

578
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:51,644
( faint voices
overlapping )

579
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,367
( voices stop )

580
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:18,838
( crackling )

581
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:40,126
( flushing )

582
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:48,100
( printer whirring )

583
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,879
( yawns )

584
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,984
13 of 'em.

585
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,652
They had about
a third of that space,

586
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:08,988
hidden behind
the fake wall.

587
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:13,492
A few flashlights,
some junk food, some water.

588
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:17,263
A portable toilet
they had to share.

589
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,233
And not enough air.

590
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,986
Judge:
I'm going to schedule
sentencing

591
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:42,421
for the third
week of next month.
Anything else today?

592
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:45,024
Your Honor, my client,

593
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:46,993
having preserved
the necessary grounds

594
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:49,661
for appeal in the record,
wishes me to state
unequivocally

595
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:52,131
that regardless
of this jury's verdict,

596
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,699
he is the victim
of wholesale perjury

597
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,534
on the part of
the state's key witness.

598
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,870
And we ask that
an appeal bond be set

599
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,239
so that he can participate
fully in this investigation.

600
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,842
An appeal bond on a conviction
of first-degree murder?

601
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:05,211
- Mr. Levy, get
a grip on yourself.
- Your Honor--

602
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:08,014
Not only will there be
no bond pending sentencing,

603
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:10,082
but as far as
I'm concerned,

604
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,718
the pre-sentencing report
is a mere formality.

605
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:14,921
Mr. Hilton
has been found guilty

606
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,923
of killing
a state's witness

607
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:19,091
who testified
in this very courtroom.

608
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:23,362
He did so in cold blood
and for pay.

609
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:25,998
Unless the pre-sentence
report indicates that
he is, in fact,

610
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,834
the Messiah come again,

611
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,402
he will very likely be
sentenced to life, no parole,

612
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,805
by a Baltimore judge
who for once in his life

613
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:36,375
gets to leave his office
feeling that his job
actually matters.

614
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,644
Mr. Hilton, are you
the second coming
of our Savior?

615
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,279
Excuse me?

616
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,181
Are you Jesus Christ
come back to earth?

617
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,783
- Um...
- ( raps )

618
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:46,986
See you
at sentencing.

619
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,727
Was it good
for you, too?

620
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:58,097
- ( chuckling )
- Mr. Little,

621
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:00,066
this is good
to get-out-of-jail-free,

622
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,501
one time only,
on anything up to
aggravated assault.

623
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:07,606
- Why, thank you, ma'am.
- No, thank you.

624
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:10,142
A rare pleasure.

625
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,681
Now for the
ceremonial eyefuck.

626
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:18,084
Come see me down the cut,
you punk-ass snitch.

627
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:20,519
I'll shove a shiv down
your cocksuckin' throat.

628
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,088
You think
on it, Bird.

629
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:24,290
You think on Brandon while you
doin' that time, you heard?

630
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,425
I'm gonna see you, man,
I swear to God!

631
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,161
Bird:
Fuck that, I'll
do you like a dog!

632
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,564
You really see him
shoot the man?

633
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,968
You really asking?

634
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:41,307
But it's fucked
because the man got

635
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,542
to where he needed to be
and she wasn't even worth it.

636
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:49,148
Daisy wasn't nothin'
past any other bitch
anywhere, you know?

637
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:51,783
And he did
all that for her

638
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:54,921
and in the end,
it ain't amount to shit.

639
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,323
Fitzgerald said that
there were no second acts

640
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:58,857
in American lives.

641
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,459
Do you believe that?

642
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,860
Man, shit,
we locked up.

643
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:05,064
We best not believe
that, right?

644
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:08,767
He's sayin' that the past
is always with us.

645
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,970
And where we come from,
what we go through,

646
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,741
how we go through it,
all that shit matters.

647
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,576
I mean, that's what
I thought he meant.

648
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,979
Go ahead.

649
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,580
Like at the end
of the book, you know?

650
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,785
Boats and tides
and all.

651
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,854
It's like you can
change up, right?

652
00:31:28,955 --> 00:31:30,789
You can say
you somebody new,

653
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,925
you can give yourself
a whole new story,

654
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:37,096
but what came first
is who you really are,

655
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:41,367
and what happened before
is what really happened.

656
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,335
And it don't matter that
some fool say he different

657
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,071
'cause the only thing
that can make you different

658
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:47,639
is what you really do
or what you really go through.

659
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:52,644
Like, you know, like
all them books in his library.

660
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,847
Now, he frontin'
with all them books,

661
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:58,084
but if we pull one
down off the shelf,

662
00:31:58,184 --> 00:32:00,719
ain't none of the pages
ever been opened.

663
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:02,721
He got all them books

664
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:06,192
and he ain't read
nary one of 'em.

665
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:11,130
Gatsby, he was who he was
and he did what he did

666
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:16,168
and 'cause he wasn't ready
to get real with the story...

667
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:20,339
that shit
caught up to him.

668
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:24,376
I think, anyway.

669
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:27,379
( ball thumps )

670
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:30,616
( phone ringing )

671
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:33,052
( modem beeping )

672
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:38,024
( ball thumps )

673
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,128
Sorry, homie.

674
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:49,068
You done with
your trial?

675
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:52,171
All right then,
let's take 'er on out.

676
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,973
Tomorrow.
I'm back with you
tomorrow, Diggsy.

677
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:56,642
You got something
else to do today?

678
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:58,077
Yeah, last bit
of business.

679
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:01,047
This is
your business.

680
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,582
Nah, this is
retirement.

681
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:06,085
And after today,
I'm retired.

682
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:11,490
( motor rumbles )

683
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:20,066
Serge:
Talk when I say,
not before.

684
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:26,338
( music playing )

685
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:29,641
Tovarisch.

686
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,577
Serge,
my nigga.

687
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:35,081
- ( chuckles )
- You're losing weight.

688
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,216
- Shit.
- You are down
to nothing,

689
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:41,053
and in this country,
supermarkets are
cathedrals.

690
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,488
I worry
for you, buddy.

691
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:45,791
- How your peoples, dawg?
- Same, good.

692
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:48,494
You talk to the man about
that other thing, right?

693
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:51,163
Because I can get
behind that business
in a big way.

694
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,832
We will talk, later.
Now, another business.

695
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,901
Right, right.

696
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:58,404
This the man with
the raggedy-ass Camaro?

697
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:00,839
Wasn't mine,
it was my cousin's.

698
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:04,076
It wasn't all
that raggedy.

699
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:11,150
Sorry.
Nicky is with us.
His cousin--

700
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,886
- but family
cannot be helped.
- Who you tellin'?

701
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,089
I got motherfuckin'
nephews and in-laws

702
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:19,525
fuckin' all my shit up,
all the time.

703
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,560
And it ain't like I can
pop a cap in their ass

704
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,130
and not hear about it
Thanksgiving time.

705
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:28,700
For real, I'm livin' life
with some burdensome niggers.

706
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,670
So what the fuck?

707
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,275
You ain't paid
my boy Cheese

708
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,244
and Cheese ain't
payin' me, right?

709
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:40,546
I ain't talkin'
about all the money
in the world,

710
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:43,482
but it ain't like
Cheese be in a position
out on that corner

711
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:47,319
to let your cuz
exemplify shit,
you feel?

712
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,121
The man cut you
some slack

713
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,423
and soon every fuckin'-up
white boy be on his titty.

714
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,559
We wanna pay
what we owe.

715
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,227
The 27, anyway.

716
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:56,328
And we're
gonna have it,
soon enough.

717
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,896
Your man doubled it,
though.

718
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,632
He also
burned the car.

719
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,269
Now the Blue Book
on that Camaro was 51.

720
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:05,771
Now let me understand.

721
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:09,475
You gonna come up in here,
havin' fucked up a package,

722
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:12,711
askin' me to tell Cheese,
who you fucked it up on,

723
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,447
to pay you out 2,400.

724
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:19,285
He gets to keep
the Camaro.

725
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:22,554
Just how good a friend is
this motherfucker to y'all?

726
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:29,728
The Cheese ain't gonna be
happy havin' to pay me back,

727
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:34,366
so I would advise y'all
to give him some distance.

728
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,736
Just so he don't
come back on my cousin.

729
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:43,175
Anyway, thanks for
bein' straight on this.

730
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,611
Fool, if it wasn't
for Serge here,

731
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:49,448
you and your cuz both
would be cadaverous
motherfuckers.

732
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,790
I went through I.N.S.,
Customs, even the State
Department.

733
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,125
There was nothing.

734
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:02,994
It's time, Jimmy.

735
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,597
You did what
you could, right?

736
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,675
Yeah, fuck it,
let her go.

737
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,877
This one to the anatomy
board in the morning.

738
00:36:20,446 --> 00:36:23,181
Jane Doe
on the paperwork.

739
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,117
Ain't right, Doc.

740
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:28,620
What the fuck
ever is?

741
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,128
You leave it
to Avon,

742
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:39,365
he's gonna get some years
off your sentence.

743
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:42,334
No doubt,
knowin' Avon.

744
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:45,404
It's all good, Dee.

745
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:49,541
Just show up and say
what Levy tells you to.

746
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:52,911
What the hell
is wrong with you?

747
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:58,517
- I'm asking you.
- Those hot shots...

748
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,919
that was Avon.

749
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:06,157
I want you home, Dee.

750
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:07,993
You asked me
to carry this.

751
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:09,461
I'm carryin' it.

752
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,297
This is mine,
right here, right now.

753
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:12,798
Boy, you ain't
listenin' to me.

754
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,266
- I am tellin' you--
- Ma!

755
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:17,303
Ma, remember we used
to live on Linden Avenue?

756
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:20,171
Remember
that house?

757
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:24,175
I was about six,
seven years old.

758
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:26,678
I was playin'
on the porch.

759
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:30,148
Them twins came by,
started pickin' on me,

760
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,918
messin' with me.

761
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:36,254
Remember that?

762
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:38,256
I'm bangin' on the door,
tryin' to get inside

763
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:41,527
and you standin'
right there
to open the door.

764
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:44,262
'Cept you ain't
lettin' me inside.

765
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:47,132
You told me to go back
out there and fight 'em,

766
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:50,302
whether I lose or not.

767
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:52,704
Remember?

768
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:54,973
They beat the shit
out of you.

769
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,176
Yeah.

770
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,611
Then you say to me,

771
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:03,749
"Boy, I might've brung you
into this world,

772
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:08,186
but you the one who
gonna have to live in it."

773
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,822
Well, Ma,
I'm still here.

774
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:12,591
Me.

775
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:16,362
You gotta let me live
like I need to live.

776
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:17,996
You tell Avon,
Stringer and Donette,

777
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:24,770
all of 'em--
to leave me be.

778
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,762
( man speaking on P.A. )

779
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,666
( ball thumps )

780
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:01,740
All right, look,
fuck y'all.

781
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,974
I need a drink.

782
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,176
Russell:
C'mon, we're almost
through 2002.

783
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,245
Naw.

784
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,047
Tomorrow is another
goddamn day, right?

785
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:13,018
Yeah.

786
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:15,020
( thumps )

787
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,197
They look thirsty,
a round on me.

788
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,467
Young Mr. Sobotka,
friend of the workin' man,

789
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,702
master of the game.

790
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:33,439
How many votes we get down
in Annapolis tonight, Frankie?

791
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:34,873
Been here long?

792
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,642
Since my hair
was brown.

793
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:39,010
I was tellin'
Chess about Benny.

794
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,580
- Benny with the harelip?
- That's a good one.

795
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,849
See Benny was working the hole
and he got hit with a shackle.

796
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:46,518
Chunk of steel clocked him good,
but he didn't tell nobody.

797
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:48,386
Not till
he came in here.

798
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:51,490
That's when Little Nose
told Benny to call
the union lawyer.

799
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,258
- Paul Sevel.
- Yeah.

800
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,227
- God rest his soul.
- So Benny calls Paul.

801
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,096
"Me been 'it wit
a 'ackerel," Benny says.

802
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:00,532
"A mackerel, Benny?

803
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,734
You working frozen foods
again?" Paul says.

804
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,102
"No, 'ot'amit.
A 'ackerel."

805
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,074
Then he slams
the phone down.

806
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:11,477
"'udder'ucker on
'is way over 'ere,

807
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:14,680
says he don't
udder'tan' me."

808
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,516
Little Nose says,
"Why he'd wanna do that?

809
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:20,085
Benny don't talk
no fuckin' better
in person."

810
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:22,120
( laughing )

811
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:27,358
So that's it?
Me and Cheese are straight?

812
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:29,360
Yeah, you're straight.

813
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:31,630
And that there's
$2,400 for Princess.

814
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,100
She was worth
more than that.

815
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,104
Hey, Dolo.
One for the bar, hon.

816
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:41,840
You win the lotto?

817
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,643
Hey, if my
old man can do it,
who the hell says I can't?

818
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:49,247
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

819
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:52,283
Nick, when I'm flush,
I'm flush.

820
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:55,120
We ain't gonna
live forever, right?

821
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,455
Next round's on me.

822
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,393
Not for me,
I'm gonna head out.

823
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:05,531
Aw, come on, Frank,
belly up.

824
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,899
Take a rain check.

825
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,674
And that one
as well, huh?

826
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:18,076
Makes 22.
All on the
Talco line.

827
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,345
All with
Horseface Pakusa
working the ship.

828
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,948
We're on it, then.

829
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:25,684
You gonna call Bunk?

830
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:29,087
Eh, Detective Moreland
is indisposed.

831
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:37,629
You with Daniels
and them?

832
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:38,764
Naw.

833
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:41,466
We just parked
the computer down there.

834
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:44,169
- We're orphaned, man.
- Orphaned?

835
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:47,138
Yeah.

836
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,608
Rawls is talkin' like

837
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:53,478
if I don't come home
with 14 clearances,

838
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:56,114
I can't
come home at all.

839
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,383
Lester too.

840
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:00,986
Where's
the love, Jimmy?

841
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:06,157
Where is
the motherfuckin' love?

842
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,226
Whoa, man.
Hey, hey--

843
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:14,265
Bam!
( laughing )

844
00:42:16,602 --> 00:42:18,403
Yeah.

845
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,138
Yeah.

846
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:24,442
( laughing )

847
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,944
So what's up
with you, man?

848
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,113
Nothin'!

849
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:31,683
Nothin', huh?

850
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:34,252
I'm done, Bunk.
Bird was my last piece
of old business.

851
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:38,356
I got nothing new.

852
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:41,893
I was tryin' for
an I.D. on this one...

853
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:47,899
but I can't even
tell you why.

854
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:51,903
Just a way
to pretend I was still
a murder police, I guess.

855
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:57,743
Who gives
a fuck, right?

856
00:42:57,843 --> 00:43:00,445
Oh!

857
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:02,413
Elena and I are
gonna try again.

858
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:06,417
Oh! Oh, shit.

859
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,286
Yeah.
I'm done fuckin'
myself up, Bunk.

860
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:11,923
I am done.

861
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:15,827
( sighs, moans )

862
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:19,264
Come on, man,
let's go home.

863
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:21,667
All right, man.

864
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:24,770
( faint music playing )

865
00:43:31,677 --> 00:43:34,312
Over here, shitbird.

866
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,689
What the hell
happened to you?

867
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:45,724
I fell down.

868
00:43:45,824 --> 00:43:47,826
How many times?

869
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:52,530
Let's walk.

870
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,300
- Pop, I'm--
- Walk with me, Zig.

871
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:03,608
Votes break for us,
that pier comes back
online by next spring.

872
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:06,311
More ships,
more work.

873
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:08,747
Yeah, great.

874
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,318
The fuck
are you about?

875
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:15,186
What?

876
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:18,456
Is that my son
lightin' hundred dollar
bills like an asshole,

877
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:20,726
in a bar full
of workin' stiffs?

878
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:22,694
What the fuck
is that?

879
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:25,463
- Ziggy: Just a smile.
- A smile?

880
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:29,434
Yep, a smile.

881
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:32,537
( sighs )
You wanna hit me again,
Pop, go ahead.

882
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:35,741
Take a shot.

883
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:37,809
Where you come by
that kinda cash?

884
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,745
You know you ain't
had the days.

885
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:41,747
Oh, definitely not.

886
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,381
It's 'cause my father's
in the union.

887
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:46,284
Fuck that.

888
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:47,886
Seniority
prevails, Zig.

889
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:49,888
It's the only way
to keep it halfway honest.

890
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:52,490
I know,
I ain't complainin'.

891
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,760
I wish I could
give you more.

892
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,527
You don't think
I want to throw
you more?

893
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:58,229
Oh, you throw plenty.

894
00:44:58,329 --> 00:44:59,430
It's just,
Christ, Zig.

895
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,632
Maybe if I'd listened
to your mother

896
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:03,902
- 'cause she's the one
always talkin' about...
- Pop, it's cool.

897
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:06,037
...you should do
the community college
like your brother.

898
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:08,774
Pop, Pop, don't.

899
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:13,111
You wanna know
what I remember?

900
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:17,148
Do you?

901
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,650
I remember you,

902
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:24,489
and Uncle Jerry,
and Uncle Walt,
Pe-Pop...

903
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:26,624
all sittin' around
the kitchen table

904
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,127
talkin' shit about
this gang and that gang.

905
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,262
Who's better
with the breakbulk.

906
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:33,431
Who could turn it around
faster, who's lazy.

907
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:37,535
Always a fucking
argument, right?

908
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:41,739
Four Polacks,
six opinions.

909
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,442
I remember
when you's all went
down to picket them scabs

910
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:46,945
at Covington piers,

911
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:50,949
how Jackie Taylor got
run over by the police car

912
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:53,318
in the middle of that
whole goddamn mess.

913
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,221
I remember
when the Paceco fell

914
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:58,589
durin' that windstorm.
You remember, right?

915
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:01,692
Killed Fat Rick dead.

916
00:46:01,793 --> 00:46:03,561
Yeah? What else
you remember?

917
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:07,332
Everything,
everything.

918
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:23,548
So tell me,
"Mr. Back-in-the-day,"

919
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:26,251
what the fuck are we doing
down here with the wharf rats

920
00:46:26,351 --> 00:46:28,586
in the middle
of the goddamn night?

921
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:31,222
Beats the fuck
outta me.

922
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:40,999
Russell:
Every one of those
Post-Its is a can

923
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,001
that disappears
when it's being offloaded.

924
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:45,170
The yellow slips,
they show up again

925
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,238
with legitimate cargo intact
and are re-entered,

926
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:49,540
so you figure
those are honest mistakes.

927
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,210
But the pink and the green,
those cans never come back.

928
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,145
They stay out of
the computer for good.

929
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:56,481
Russell:
And the pink one, like
the can full of dead girls,

930
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:58,749
they're all from the same
shipping line-- Talco,

931
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,887
and on all of them,
the same checker,
this guy Thomas Pakusa--

932
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:05,723
he goes by "Horseface"--
he's the one working.

933
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,092
You went at him
already, right?

934
00:47:07,192 --> 00:47:09,160
We grand juried
his ass,

935
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,729
but that motherfucker
didn't blink.

936
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,498
( groaning )

937
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:22,107
You wanna
hit the head?

938
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:24,442
Get yourself right,
Detective?

939
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:27,879
( groans )
Naw, I'm good.

940
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:32,717
Ahem.
The point is,

941
00:47:32,817 --> 00:47:34,519
we have
a pattern here.

942
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,956
What they're doing
eliminates almost
all of the paper trail.

943
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:40,325
As long
as they can get a truck
past the outbound lanes

944
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:42,327
and there's a dozen ways
to do that,

945
00:47:42,427 --> 00:47:43,962
the only thing
they leave behind

946
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:45,931
is a little tell-tale
in the computer.

947
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:47,999
A box comes off
the ship,

948
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:50,535
flashes for a few
moments, and blip,
then it's gone.

949
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:53,238
( heaving )

950
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:58,443
Freamon:
Our target is supposed
to be Sobotka, right?

951
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:01,346
I mean,
on paper anyway.

952
00:48:01,446 --> 00:48:03,581
What you're tellin' me
is that it's better
than a fair bet

953
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:05,783
that he actually is
a target in Bunk's murders.

954
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,453
( heaving )

955
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:17,062
Maybe we can
fold our investigation
into yours, Lieutenant.

956
00:48:17,162 --> 00:48:18,563
And put my ass
in the air

957
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:20,932
with 14 open homicides
that might never clear?

958
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:22,867
The bosses wouldn't
blame you for that.

959
00:48:22,968 --> 00:48:24,535
I wouldn't shine either.

960
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,337
I'm trying to use what
we do with this detail

961
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:28,306
to get a major case
squad going.

962
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,874
I come up outta here
with all those open files,

963
00:48:29,975 --> 00:48:32,710
it doesn't smell
as sweet.

964
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,147
- So what's the
next move on this?
- We clone the computer

965
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,482
and start watching
what's happening

966
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:40,085
on the docks
in real time.

967
00:48:43,888 --> 00:48:46,157
( moans )
Oh-hh.

968
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:51,162
( retching,
spitting )

969
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:55,967
( groans )
Oh, shit.

970
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:02,807
Dee.

971
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:04,509
Yo, Dee.

972
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:31,869
Just wine, huh?

973
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,772
I'm not drinking
much anymore.

974
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:37,242
No Jameson's?

975
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:40,811
Maybe a quick fuck
of the waitress, then.

976
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,580
Okay, I deserve
that one, too,

977
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,416
even though I'm not
doing much of that
anymore either.

978
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:47,152
Anything else?

979
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:50,255
I'm sorry.
I don't know where
it still comes from.

980
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:51,722
I mean, it's been
a year, right?

981
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,191
You deserve
to be angry.

982
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:56,361
What's the point,
though?

983
00:49:57,862 --> 00:50:01,266
How's work?

984
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:03,501
What, just so we talk
about everything in my life

985
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:04,869
that pisses you off?

986
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:06,804
Drinking, women,
the work.

987
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:09,607
Just trying to make
conversation.

988
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:13,478
Well, I retired.

989
00:50:13,578 --> 00:50:15,413
Excuse me?

990
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:19,650
Yeah.
It's boats,
not bodies.

991
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:23,454
On a good day,
I catch crabs and
count seagulls.

992
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:25,590
That's not you.

993
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,059
It wasn't me.

994
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:31,729
It wasn't me
not to drink,
or dog around either.

995
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:36,601
A lot of things
weren't me.

996
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:42,107
I want another chance.

997
00:50:47,312 --> 00:50:49,980
How about a fuck
for the road instead?

998
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:53,484
( moaning )

999
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:57,222
( laughing )

1000
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:04,495
( grunting )

1001
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:28,853
- How are you doing?
- Spiros: Okay.

1002
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:30,188
You unload this shit,

1003
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:31,589
you gotta ditch the trucks
and the trailers both.

1004
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:34,392
Make it look like it was
a hijack, all right?

1005
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,796
Niko.

1006
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:41,999
If you want,
I will pay you straight,

1007
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:47,638
or Eton can pay
in heroin.

1008
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:50,141
Wholesale.

1009
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:57,782
Turn it around,
you can make 60, 70,000.

1010
00:51:57,882 --> 00:52:00,451
Nicky, he's offering

1011
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:03,188
like, three, four times
the value.

1012
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:07,192
I'm out on this.

1013
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:10,795
Nick, even if we
walk it up to White Mike,

1014
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:13,231
we can make 30, 35,000.

1015
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:18,169
Nicky, come on, man.

1016
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,612
Half in cash,
half in dope.

1017
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,755
( claps )

1018
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:40,625
Nicky, I can turn that
package around no problem.

1019
00:52:40,725 --> 00:52:42,660
- No, Zig, I got it.
- Nicky, you don't know--

1020
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,663
You hear me?
I said I fuckin'
got this one.

1021
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:47,765
Why don't you stay at home
and watch cartoons,

1022
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:50,501
let me handle this shit
for the both of us,
all right?

1023
00:52:58,042 --> 00:53:00,345
You fuckin' walkin'
home or what?

1024
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:04,282
( sighs )

1025
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,991
Hey, girl.

1026
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:15,693
What do we do
with the day?

1027
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:17,127
Me?

1028
00:53:17,228 --> 00:53:18,929
Oh, I gotta pick up
the boys from the sitter.

1029
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,300
- Okay, great.
- They're gonna be
coming back here,

1030
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,834
Michael has piano
this afternoon.

1031
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:27,137
No problem, we'll do
somethin' after that.

1032
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:30,375
Maybe we go by my place,
pick up some things.

1033
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:35,846
I don't want
the boys to know
that you were here.

1034
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:36,914
It's gonna get them
hoping,

1035
00:53:39,116 --> 00:53:41,752
so...

1036
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:44,221
you need to leave.

1037
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:00,538
Look at this
sorry shit.

1038
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:03,408
Motherfuckers
not appreciate nothin'
that comes to 'em free.

1039
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,679
I'll take it in the back.
Maybe they got some
duct tape will fix it.

1040
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,681
- Dee, right?
- Yeah.

1041
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,783
Yeah, you can't be
in here now, man.

1042
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:48,353
Yo, man, y'all
didn't get any final
calls this week, yo?

1043
00:54:48,453 --> 00:54:49,854
Yeah, we got some.

1044
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,556
I didn't see
any out there.

1045
00:54:51,656 --> 00:54:53,090
All right, man,
give me a minute.

1046
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,291
Let me finish up
right here real quick

1047
00:54:54,392 --> 00:54:57,027
and I'll go
and get one for you.

1048
00:54:58,195 --> 00:55:01,499
( grunting )

1049
00:56:32,457 --> 00:56:33,624
- Hey, yo.
- What's up?

1050
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:36,461
I know you got
my motherfuckin' cigs, yo.

1051
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:39,564
- You tryin' to curb me?
- Naw, man.

1052
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:55,179
( instrumental music
playing )

1052
00:56:56,305 --> 00:57:56,512

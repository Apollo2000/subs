00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,376
( man on the radio )
...the Big Fat Morning Show.

2
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,111
Now, do you want to play
the brand-new big fat game,

3
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:11,945
"Big Fat Match Game,"
call us now...

4
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:14,115
( phone ringing )

5
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,784
Chantay:
Hello?

6
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,520
Hello?

7
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,124
Avon:
Who was that?

8
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,393
They hung up
without saying.

9
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:28,028
They hung up
without saying?

10
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,968
Chantay:
What you care?

11
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:37,538
You never use the damn phone
in here no how.

12
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:44,712
( running down stairs )

13
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,326

00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,281
( pager beeps )

15
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,351
Shit.

16
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,420
What's up, baby?

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,922
I need you to get
them phone lines
up out that house.

18
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,192
Out the apartment?
Why?

19
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,726
I'm saying,
what Chantay
gonna say

20
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,363
about not
havin' a line
in her own place?

21
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,499
All right.

22
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,368
Got you.

23
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:42,603
Wee-Bey:
What's up, man,
you got a problem?

24
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,472
Good.

25
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:46,274
I'm just sayin' though,

goin' past careful,

26
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:47,841
man, with all
of this, man.

27
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,177
Like we buggin'
out or something.

28
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:51,445
You know, like
we paranoid and shit.

29
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,788
Naw, I don't wanna
use this phone.

30
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:01,989
We used this
phone yesterday.

31
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,491
Shh.

32
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,626
What you blowing out
your mouth for, man?

33
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,528
You act like ain't nobody
out to get me, man?

34
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,630
Or got no
motherfucking enemies.

35
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,665
Naw, man.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,335
We all right.

37
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,873
( theme music playing )

38
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:24,512
* If you walk
through the garden *

39
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,682
* You better
watch your back *

40
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,621
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

41
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:36,257
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

42
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:41,295
* If you walk
through Jesus *

43
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:45,065
* He'll save your soul

44
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,836
* You gotta
keep the devil *

45
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:52,139
* Down in the hole

46
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,909
* All the angels sing

47
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,780
* About Jesus' mighty soul

48
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,617
* And they shoot you
with your wing *

49
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:07,321
* Keep you close
to the Lord *

50
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:11,191
* Don't pay heed
to temptation *

51
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:15,128
* Oh, your hands
are so cold *

52
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:18,866
* You got to
keep the devil *

53
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:22,503
* Way down in the hole

54
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,980

* Way down in the hole

( dog barking )

59
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,802
A'ight, this is
going to be so easy,

60
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,170
them east side chumps
ain't nothing like
Avon's people.

61
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,407
Watch, y'all
gonna see.

62
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,343
A'ight, now y'all gonna
be here, all right?

63
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,778
Hold up, hold up.

64
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,547
Hey, yo, Boo!

65
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,749
I'm gonna slide
up through here.

66
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,752
Bailey, you gonna
cover the alley.

67
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:12,986
Yo.

68
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,424
( music playing
on headphones )

69
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,361
Yo!

70
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,330
Yo, Maurice short, man.

71
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,664
- How short?
- Three.

72
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,435
Tell him to grow
a couple of inches.

73
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,407
Where you gonna be at?

74
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,277
That be the trap,
right there, homes.

75
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:40,848
You figure
they roll through
the alley for sure?

76
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,452
Man, rats
always run to holes
in time of danger.

77
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,520
Brandon:
And you him,
ain't you?

78
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,022
- Omar: Who?
- Danger.

79
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,092
Naw, man,
I'm just a nigger
with a plan, that all.

80
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,261
And a shotgun.

81
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:56,296
Omar:
For sure.

82
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,767
Sorry I'm late.

83
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:03,003
Got myself lost
down the other hallway.

84
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,339
That leads
to the loading dock.

85
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,708
Yeah, and deep storage.

86
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,210
- So, this is
where they put you?
- Mm-hmm.

87
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,679
Quite a message
they're sending.

88
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,113
Yeah, and that
message is...

89
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:14,382
"Out of sight,
out of mind."

90
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,684
Spoken like
a true troglodyte.

91
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:22,356
Whole lot of dead trees
behind this nonsense.

92
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:23,824
The foundation
of your case,
detective.

93
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,393
You lay it
in right, you
can build on it.

94
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:26,627
You lay it wrong,

95
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,463
everything
on top falls.

96
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,999
- We ready?
- Um-hmm.

97
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,934
Do you solemnly
swear and affirm

98
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,335
that the
affidavit is true

99
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,537
and accurate to the
best of your knowledge?

100
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,138
- I do.
- I do.

101
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:41,008
Then by the power vested in me,
I now declare you man and wife.

102
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,844
Did he swear already?

103
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,847
- The state's attorney?
- Yeah. I see it.

104
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,149
Second copy is
sealed for the court

105
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,718
and the police
get the others.

106
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,252
How's this work?

107
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,255
Same frequency as
the one carried by
D'Angelo Barksdale.

108
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,625
He's gets a page,
we get a page.

109
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:58,826
Ah.

110
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,293
So, we up now?

111
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:03,163
It's official.
You're up.

112
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,032
Then let the game begin.

113
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,800
( pager beeping )

114
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,172
Phalen:
Celebrities always
seem much smaller

115
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,141
when you meet them
in person.

116
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,746
( whistling
"The Farmer in the Dell" )

117
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,318
Yo, yo!

118
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,087
Hey, yo!

119
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:31,224
Check it out,
here he come.

120
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,993
Somethin'
ain't right, yo.

121
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,195
Man:
Watch out, man,
here come that fool.

122
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,797
He's packing.

123
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,231
Here he come.

124
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,968
Yo, yo, come on.
Omar's coming, man!

125
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,471
Oh, shit!

126
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,983
( continues whistling )

127
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,094
Mm, yeah,

128
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:10,163
the cheese
stands alone.

129
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,233
How you know?

130
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,735
'Cause if you could,
I'd have been had.

131
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:18,205
Yo, he sayin'
you can't catch
the bug

132
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,907
just by getting
yo' dick sucked.

133
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:23,777
Dumbass, you gotta
be in some pussy t
o get it, all right?

134
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,646
Man, wear a coat
if you want,

135
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,681
don't nobody like
suckin' on a rubber.

136
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,918
- How would you know?
- ( laughing )

137
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:37,491
Who you trying
to fuck anyway?

138
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,860
Arletta Mouzone.

139
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,361
Treenee's cousin.

140
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,296
Damn, man,
in that case

141
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,365
use a big-ass
condom, all right?

142
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,300
Use a trash bag.
Fuck that.

143
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,604
I wouldn't run up
in that bitch with
D'Angelo's dick.

144
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,058
Ahh!

145
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,061
Easy to see why niggers coming
around here stealing our shit!

146
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,598
Yo, you know what?
You know what, nigger?

147
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:20,901
- What?
- ( pager beeping )

148
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,008
Forget it.

149
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,912
( computer beeping )

150
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,148
Freamon:
One-four-two isn't a working
telephone exchange.

151
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,085
Six intercepts so far,
and five aren't
working numbers?

152
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,688
Something wrong
with the recorder?

153
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,422
We're getting
what you'd expect,

154
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,124
seven digits of
a telephone number

155
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,860
and a two-digit add-on
to identify the caller,

156
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,197
- like here, 13.
- McNulty, line one.

157
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,700
All right.
Yeah.

158
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,401
McNulty:
Did you just get
a one-four-two exchange?

159
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,069
Freamon:
Yep, that's what
we got too.

160
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,270
McNulty:
It's fucked up.

161
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,739
Freamon:
All right, later.

162
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,844
He's got the same
numbers on the readout
of the cloned pagers.

163
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,545
So, it's not the recorder.

164
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,380
These mopes are using a
code to cover their calls?

165
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,749
Uh-huh.

166
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,150
That's pretty
damn sophisticated.

167
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,819
What is?

168
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,454
Well, they've coded
the telephone numbers

169
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,856
in their pager messages.

170
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,591
How you know?

171
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,492
Every time the
Barksdale kid's
pager goes off,

172
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,394
this machine gives us
a message and time.

173
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,796
McNulty's carrying
a cloned pager,

174
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,197
but this is what
we use in court.

175
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,766
Same with those
pin registers.

176
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,500
Every time someone
uses either

177
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,369
the pay phones
in the low-rise court,

178
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,938
we get the telephone
number,

179
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,006
the time and the duration
of the call.

180
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,407
Incoming calls too.

181
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,577
Spy shit. Very cool.

182
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,680
You say they're using
some kind of code?

183
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,048
Yeah, they got to be.

184
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,183
These numbers don't
make no fucking sense.

185
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,690
You rang?

186
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,392
Omar's ride.
Bubbles spotted it.

187
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,527
Different tags,
no stolen report,

188
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,063
these come back
right for the van,

189
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,431
but Bubs makes it by the
cargo rack on the roof.

190
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,100
Good scope.

191
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,169
You wanna take him?

192
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,436
Can't hurt to try.

193
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,605
We pop Omar,
get a gun...

194
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,407
he might let
us work him.

195
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,643
Anything coming through
on the pager?

196
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,846
Eight hits so far,

197
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,316
most of them
in some kinda code.

198
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,820
These ain't Baltimore
exchanges, that's for sure.

199
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,822
Three weeks to get
Daniels to agree,

200
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,223
a week to write out
the affidavit,

201
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,092
and then
this bullshit.

202
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:29,496
How complex a code can
it be if these knuckleheads
are usin' it?

203
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,399
Then again, what's
it say about us if
we can't break it?

204
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,836
You wanna run Bubs
back downtown,

205
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,370
I'll sit here
and wait for you.

206
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,406
All right.

207
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,377
What I miss,
girlfriend?

208
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,213
Not a goddamn thing.

209
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,381
Yeah, boring,
ain't we?

210
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,885
How y'all do
what you do every day
and not wanna get high?

211
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,321
That's what
I be askin'.

212
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,264
It's been a little hectic
down here, right, cuz?

213
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,067
String, man, I can't lie.

214
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,669
Them stickup
boys they caught
us dead up.

215
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,739
And the knockers--

216
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,907
shit, I don't know
what the fuck that was.

217
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,476
Boy: Five-O.
Five-O, coming up.

218
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,211
Five-O,
coming up, y'all.

219
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,479
Woman:
Time-out.

220
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,314
Bell:
C'mon, man, what is that?

221
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,682
Dee:
What?

222
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,217
You gotta get
your crew to
understand that

223
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,586
it's the stick-up
crews and the creepers

224
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,088
that be giving us
the most trouble.

225
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,990
As soon as they start
thinking like that,

226
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,992
you're not gonna have anymore
surprises, you feel me?

227
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:35,128
'Cause you know,
your uncle and me,

228
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,630
we think you got
a snitch up in the shop.

229
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,599
- ( beeper beeps )
- What?

230
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,035
Someone who
tips off the
stick-up crew.

231
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,504
And you gotta
be on that, right?

232
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,439
You gotta
be on that.

233
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,108
I'm gonna tell you
what you do.

234
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,311
What day is it
today, Friday?

235
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,980
What happen
on Friday?

236
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,514
Payday.

237
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,316
- Not this Friday.
- Why not?

238
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,218
No, no, what you gonna do
is you gonna call them

239
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,488
like you gonna
pay them and then
you crack 'em.

240
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:02,856
You tell 'em you're
not happy

241
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,025
with what
they fucking pass
as work down here.

242
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,195
And when you not happy,
they ain't getting paid.
You feel me?

243
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,830
Yeah, but String, man,
you don't pay a nigger,

244
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,631
he ain't gonna
work for you.

245
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,634
What you think a nigger's
gonna get a job?

246
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,037
You think these
niggers gonna be
like fuck it,

247
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:19,539
let me quit this
game here and go
to college?

248
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,676
Naw, man, they gonna
buck a little, but they
not gonna walk.

249
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,980
And in the end,
you gonna get respect.

250
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,115
Yeah.

251
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,017
And when that
money run out,

252
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,484
they'll come up to
you and roll on you

253
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,887
and ask you for an advance
and shit,

254
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,389
when they flat-ass broke.

255
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,692
Them the niggers that
you strike off your list.

256
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,762
But that nigger
that stay-eating,

257
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,531
the nigger that
steady-rollin',

258
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,766
ain't asking
you for shit...

259
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,369
that's the nigger
I want to hear about.

260
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,471
Understand?

261
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,975
Yeah, man, shit, you know
how to play a nigger

262
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,844
into a corner, String.

263
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,645
Yo, take care
of this right here.

264
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,080
You my favorite girl.

265
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,083
Shit, let me
handle this, man.

266
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,453
Hey, yo, Poot.

267
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,288
- Yeah, I--
- Come here, man.

268
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,489
What's happening?

269
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,690
What the fuck
is that?

270
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,892
What the fuck is that?

271
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,560
You know
the fucking rules.

272
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,109
( copy machine whirring )

273
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,220
What the fuck
are you doin'?

274
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,522
Copying.

275
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,193
A telephone?

276
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,829
This fucking detail
is too much.

277
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,340
Greggs:
It's after 3:00.

278
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,142
So, where
the boys at?

279
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:05,278
Maybe they only
come out at night.

280
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,782
McNulty:
I used to have a guy
like Omar working for me.

281
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,752
Guy named Reuben Terry.

282
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,254
Is he good?

283
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,856
Saw the street
like we wish we could.

284
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,593
Ain't nothing
like a good CI.

285
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,365
School's out.

286
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,534
Greggs:
Hmm.

287
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,236
Can I use your cell phone?

288
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,907
( dialing )

289
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,914
( knocks )

290
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,218
Yeah, I got that.

291
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,287
I did.

292
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,989
Mm-hmm.

293
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,259
I know.

294
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,362
You don't know-- what do you
mean, you don't know?

295
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,897
For Christ sakes, Elena,
I'm their father.

296
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,733
You think I'd let 'em
sleep on the floor?

297
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,370
Yes, I got them.

298
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,006
Sheets, pillows,
comforters, pillowcases.

299
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,041
I fucking got them.

300
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,377
Color, what the fuck do you
care what color they are?

301
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,479
Hello?

302
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,286
Lost her.

303
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:20,720
I bet.

304
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,989
You know something?

305
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,923
My ex-wife, the way
she acts sometimes,

306
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,093
the way she deals
with shit...

307
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,729
you would think--

308
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,631
a less enlightened
man than myself,

309
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,400
cruder man
than myself,

310
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,202
a man less sensitized
to the qualities

311
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:36,836
and charms
and value of women,

312
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,871
a man like that, not me,
but a man like that,

313
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,041
he just might
call her a cunt.

314
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,077
You just called the mother
of your children a cunt.

315
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,512
No, I did not
call her the--

316
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:48,015
- Yes, you fucking did.
- No, I did not!

317
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,117
Let's just leave this, okay?
I got some stuff to do.

318
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:58,425
Man:
Five-O, running low,
yo, man, get out there.

319
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,101
Not much
fighting this time.

320
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,702
You getting
tired, asshole?

321
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,904
Still draggin'
from the whuppin'
Kima put on him.

322
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,773
Fucked you up like
a cop should, didn't she?

323
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,142
That's one thing
about Kima,

324
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,977
she put a hurtin'
on you like a man.

325
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,114
Get your
monkey ass up.

326
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,685
You're gonna want your
business card back, right?

327
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:28,155
Come on.

328
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:37,164
( McNulty singing )
* From Bantry Bay
to the Derry Cay *

329
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:40,767
* From Galway
to Dublin Town *

330
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:44,671
* Well, I've never seen

331
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,773
* My brown Colleen

332
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:50,677
* Like County Down

333
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,446
( humming )

334
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:06,059
* There's a man in
the County Down... *

335
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,027
First I go
in, play nice.

336
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,696
Then you come
in, play bad.

337
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:12,299
I ain't gonna
be playing.

338
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,615
Bracelet too tight?

339
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,200
You rackin' up all
kinds of points, ain't you?

340
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,102
First, you put a cop
in the hospital,

341
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,571
damn near kill his ass
with that punch.

342
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,174
Now, you on the wing
from Boys' Village.

343
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,976
Man, I'm 16,
all right?

344
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,311
What the fuck
they gonna do to me?

345
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,648
That's the least of
your worries, my friend.

346
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:06,052
I got a partner outside
who can't wait to get in
here and fuck you up.

347
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:09,589
Cop you banged
was Herc's uncle.

348
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,891
Herc wants off the leash
on this one.

349
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,327
And, uh,

350
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,464
I suppose you at the other
end of that leash, huh?

351
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,536
See,

352
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,473
I don't want
to play it that way.

353
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,109
I know about comin' up
hard and all.

354
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,646
Why, you...

355
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,215
you came up hard?

356
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,016
Flag House projects.

357
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,818
Eastside.

358
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,322
Yeah, Flag House?

359
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,528
You know,
you remind me of me.

360
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,466
I'm thinkin'

361
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,835
we should work
somethin' out.

362
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,173
What do I get?

363
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,747
What you want?

364
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:17,757
I want...

365
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,194
for you
to suck my dick.

366
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:31,170
I'll beat your fucking
monkey ass.

367
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,439
Come on, take it easy.

368
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,106
You supposed
to be the good cop.

369
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:37,210
- Dumb motherfucker.
- Herc: What, what?

370
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,788
Hello, may I help you?

371
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,257
Yeah, we'd like
a table.

372
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,924
And you have
reservations?

373
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:56,263
Naw, I thought,
you know, we could
just walk in.

374
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,565
Let me see what I got.

375
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,601
That's two?

376
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,740
Well, follow me, please.

377
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,819
Your coat, ma'am?

378
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,423
Uh, can we get that one
over there?

379
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:24,824
Ah, it's Friday night,

380
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,959
those are for patrons
who made reservations.

381
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,728
Let me get your chair
for you, ma'am.

382
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,900
It's okay, man.

383
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,203
Here you are.

384
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:39,406
Here you are, sir.

385
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,475
Your waiter will
be with you shortly.

386
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,548
You should of
pushed him, Dee.

387
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,972
Oh, bastards.

388
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,925
Sarge, nobody answers
at juvenile intake

389
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,561
and we've been callin'.

390
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:36,763
Well, clearly, they're
not as dedicated as
you two detectives.

391
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:40,367
So, what time does
the duty intake
consultant get here?

392
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,634
You missed
the 8:00.

393
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:43,570
You got another one
around midnight.

394
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:46,906
Midnight?

395
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,875
You think maybe
if we left you
the paperwork,

396
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,977
you could put him
in the box till
intake gets here?

397
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,780
( phone rings )

398
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,092
Hemorrhoid.

399
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,709
For the crumbs.

400
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,911
Yeah, right.

401
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,418
- You like
your dinner?
- Yeah.

402
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,685
That shrimp
was right.

403
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,687
Yeah, it was
good, right?

404
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,122
Mm-hmm.

405
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,029
Think they know?

406
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,297
Do they know what?

407
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:46,499
You know.

408
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,134
What I'm about.

409
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,403
What you mean, Dee?

410
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:54,641
Come on, you know,
it's like,

411
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,576
we get all
dressed up, right?

412
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,578
Come all the way
across town.

413
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:00,713
Fancy place
like this.

414
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,815
After we finished, we gonna
go down to the harbor.

415
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,517
Walk around a little bit,
you know?

416
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,318
Acting like we belong down here,
know what I'm saying?

417
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,287
So?

418
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,623
Your money
good, right?

419
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,726
Dee, we ain't the only
black people in here.

420
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:15,728
It ain't about that.

421
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,129
It ain't what
I'm talkin' about.

422
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,931
It's about where we...

423
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,166
come on, you know.

424
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,368
I'm just saying,
you know,

425
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:24,904
I feel like some shit
just stay with you.

426
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:28,475
You know what I'm saying?
Like, hard as you try,

427
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,409
you still can't go nowhere,
you know what I'm saying?

428
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,144
Can I interest you
in dessert?

429
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,681
Uh, yes,
thank you.

430
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,116
Can I have some
chocolate cake?

431
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,951
I'll bring the cart.

432
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:45,492
Boy, don't nobody
give a damn about
you and your story.

433
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,360
You got money, you get to
be whatever you say you are.

434
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,162
That's the way it is.

435
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,003
Oh, sir, I'm sorry.

436
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,138
These are
the samples.

437
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,246
And for you, sir?

438
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:08,915
Very good.

439
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:19,492
Herc:
Don't be a bitch,
admit it.

440
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,529
Go ahead.

441
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,365
Admit you're wrong,
be a man.

442
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,668
Yeah, I gotta confess.

443
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:31,804
This sub beats
chink-ass Bob's
by a mile.

444
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:35,407
'Course, you might
be all that when it comes
to thumpin' on niggers,

445
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:38,144
but you can't do shit
with that stick, man.

446
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,279
Oh, you do better.

447
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:41,548
I play.

448
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,215
Says he plays.

449
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:45,885
He might.

450
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,521
I'm even better
with two hands.

451
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,859
Bell:
I checked it out, man.
Stinkum true on this one.

452
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:55,862
'Cept for that nigger
Scar from New York,

453
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:58,230
Edmondson Gulley
is wide open.

454
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,566
What about Tee-Tees' crew?

455
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,800
Ah, naw, them niggers
dried up

456
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,569
when they took
that federal charge.

457
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,236
Most of 'em laid up
somewhere, gettin'
high and shit.

458
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,607
I'll tell you what.

459
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,642
You holler at the boy Scar.

460
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,544
Let him know, man, it's time
for him to take a stroll.

461
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:13,379
If he give you
any beef at all,

462
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,447
- we gonna put Wee-Bey
and Bird on it.
- All right.

463
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:16,749
And then once
we got him outta there,

464
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,417
we'll send in the smokers.

465
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,720
They can run out all the little
poop butt locals and shit,

466
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,723
or, if you think, it's some
cats in there who got game,

467
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,257
then we put 'em
on our team.

468
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,859
All right, who you want
to run it?

469
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,095
- Send Stinkum up here.
- All right.

470
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:32,298
He the one who saw the shot,
so, he gets a shot.

471
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,709
All right, okay,

472
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,076
not bad, not bad.

473
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:47,179
Can't let the duty
officer see that.

474
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,015
You wanna give it
a rest, man?

475
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:50,082
You down 60.

476
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:52,318
Pssht, that might be
your whole damn salary,

477
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:53,753
but I clock
that shit in minutes.

478
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,487
Rack 'em an'
break 'em, man.

479
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:57,724
You the guys waiting
for juvenile intake?

480
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:59,792
He's in the squad room.

481
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:03,295
If I had more time,
I'd run you.

482
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,897
Mm-hmm.

483
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:07,634
Give you a tip,
Preston.

484
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:09,535
You gonna
run a hustle,

485
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:12,171
you best stay
with what you know.

486
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:16,208
Hey, man, fuck you
and your tired-ass
advice, all right?

487
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,113
But...

488
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:24,016
that sammich
was good.

489
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:35,227
You gonna move our little thing
down to Edmondson Avenue.

490
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,730
Take the Gulley.

491
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,933
What about, uh, Scar?

492
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,136
Who?

493
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:48,074
Listen, I'm givin' you
points on the package,

494
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:51,577
so you make a go of it,
you hear me?

495
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:53,079
You working
for yourself, too,

496
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:56,082
so you gonna put out
the strong product.

497
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,750
You gonna get
the locals behind it.

498
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,085
It's as simple
as that.

499
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,720
You get your team together,
you feel me?

500
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:03,489
So go on and wait for me
downstairs.

501
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:04,724
I'll be down
in a minute, man.

502
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:07,326
We gonna make this money
run in a few.

503
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:09,729
Smile or
something, nigger.

504
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:10,963
Bell:
Whoo.

505
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,999
Made that
nigger's night.

506
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,534
Yeah, he
deserved it, though.
He deserved it.

507
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,269
( pager beeps )

508
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:21,708
Ah, it's Wee-Bey.
We got one.

509
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,475
Oh, you think
it's Omar?

510
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,979
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
It's one of the young'uns,
I think.

511
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,580
Oh, one down,
two to go, right?

512
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,416
Yeah, motherfuckers.

513
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,852
Try to rob me, baby.

514
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:36,155
( muffled music playing )

515
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:03,682
( keypad beeps )

516
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,970
One, two, three.

517
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:53,299
A winner.

518
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,401
Ah, a match?
Which case?

519
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:56,969
The one you just
brought me, Bunk.

520
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,704
Casing in that girl
shot up in Northeast.

521
00:28:58,805 --> 00:28:59,906
Kresson?

522
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:01,673
Diedre Kresson,
right, yeah.

523
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:03,542
She matches up
with two other cases,
both from last year.

524
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:04,743
Which ones?

525
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:06,545
Toreen...

526
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,915
Boyle, some other
fucker named Ligget.

527
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:11,483
- It's there in the report.
- Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett.

528
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,819
Yeah, them.

529
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,354
Casings from all three
killings go to a .45,

530
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:16,823
probably Colt Classic.

531
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:19,826
Fuckin' Landsman,
how's he do it?

532
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,593
You like Landsman
for these three?

533
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,829
I don't know, Bunk.

534
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,696
As sergeants go,
Jay's a sociopath and all,

535
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:26,899
but I'd have to go with
an actual gangster.

536
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,703
Hey, Jimmy,
you sittin' down?

537
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:34,841
Man on TV:
I said it was hot, but if you
got these barbecue gloves.

538
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,775
Bubbles:
You got a Johnny Weeks
up in here?

539
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:38,777
- Who?
- Johnny Weeks.

540
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:40,412
Over in the
game room.

541
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:43,182
- Obliged.
- Any smokes?

542
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,884
I'm out.

543
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:47,019
Man:
You gotta give
the medication

544
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,255
a chance to work
in your system, man.

545
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:00,299
Hey.

546
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,567
Brought you something.

547
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,969
Hey.

548
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:06,873
Yeah, some chicken pieces
and some fries.

549
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:08,374
Bought you a
shake, but I...

550
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,877
I dropped it
on the bus.

551
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,083
It comes in a bag,
goes out in a bag.

552
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:24,924
How long you
have that for?

553
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,496
I fucked up, man.

554
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:32,131
Yeah, I saw.

555
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,533
There was nothin'
I could do, you know?

556
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:40,406
It's like first
I got beat, right,
then I get this.

557
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,642
( chuckles )

558
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:46,245
What are these for, huh?

559
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:50,616
They say I got the bug.

560
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:56,889
The bug, huh?

561
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:58,824
They checked me when
I was in the hospital--

562
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,927
Are they sure?

563
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,637
Where you been at?

564
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:15,474
Here and there,
I'm at it.

565
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,944
I'd have come past
sooner, but I been on
kind of like a mission.

566
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:19,611
- A mission?
- Yeah, yeah.

567
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,014
Them hoppers
that beat you down,
they got problems now.

568
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,216
Yeah, them and the people
that sling for 'em even.

569
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:25,884
What?

570
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:29,088
I put the police
on their ass.

571
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:31,723
Police?

572
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,359
What you get locked
up or something?

573
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,794
No, come on.
No, I'm not workin' for 'em.

574
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,163
I'm workin' with 'em.

575
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:39,065
They don't give me
the badge soon enough,

576
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:42,368
- I keep doin'
like I do.
- Why?

577
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,705
What do you mean why?

578
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:48,240
How you going to ask
me why?

579
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,142
Why the fuck are you
in here, man,

580
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,743
with all these fallin'-out
motherfuckers?

581
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:54,413
Why you passin' shit
through a bag?

582
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,382
Why they beat you down?

583
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:59,051
Why I couldn't
do nothin' about it?

584
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,888
It's all part of
the game, right?

585
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:04,456
I mean,
you taught me that.

586
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:19,972
What you up to
in here, man?

587
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,475
Doin' the meetings.

588
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,344
NA?

589
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,545
Yeah.

590
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:29,081
Twice a day.

591
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:30,516
That's good,
man, that's good.

592
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,884
It's good, Johnny.
Give the body comfort.

593
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:34,520
Yeah.

594
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,455
No, you needed
a change.

595
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,991
Guess so.

596
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,861
I'll be getting out of here
the end of the month.

597
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,264
It's all right, man, you know,
they got meetings everywhere.

598
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:47,133
You ain't gotta
worry about that.

599
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:51,703
Bubs?

600
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,042
Who's got the best
package now?

601
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,177
Get the fuck
out of here, man.

602
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:00,146
I'm comin'
home, right?

603
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,751
A'ight, well, shit is weak
all over, you know?

604
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:09,255
Got some boys
up at Baker and
Calhoun, though.

605
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:10,656
They had a smoker out
the other day though.

606
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:12,391
Yeah?

607
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,026
Knocked a couple
niggers out.

608
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:16,462
Ain't you a trip?

609
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:18,464
Beat down, bagged up.

610
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:20,199
Still ready
to rip and run, huh?

611
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:24,536
I'm a Viking, homes.

612
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,605
"I'm a Viking, homes."

613
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,614
Hey, McNulty.

614
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:39,218
There's something here
that needs kissing.

615
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:42,488
Yeah, speak again,
oh, toothless one.

616
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:46,024
I guess you know now
why I wear the stripes
in the family.

617
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,693
A good call, Jay.

618
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,128
'Course, if Keeley
hadn't fucked
the scene up,

619
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:50,862
you'd a had that casing
months ago, right?

620
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,565
Keeley. Let Keeley
be Keeley.

621
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:56,502
We all can't be princes
of the city, now can we?

622
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:57,869
Speaking of which...

623
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,539
sit down.

624
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:05,877
May I ask you a question
that is essential
to your career?

625
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,113
What?

626
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,647
Who do you serve?

627
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:12,318
I am asking
you to identify,
for the record,

628
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:13,819
your commanding
officer.

629
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,354
- Major Rawls.
- Excellent.

630
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:17,256
Now with that
thought in mind,

631
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,658
I advise you to go
immediately into the
major's office,

632
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,060
carrying the break
I've given you in
the Kresson case,

633
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:23,895
and kiss
the man's ring.

634
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,265
Because, Jimmy,
I have talked you right
out of the shithouse.

635
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:27,933
- Yeah?
- Here's the deal.

636
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:31,137
You wrap up
this thing with
narcotics in two weeks.

637
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:33,139
You put yourself
back in the rotation

638
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,107
when we go back
to night work.

639
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:38,110
You do that
and you're back
in the fold.

640
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,412
Thanks, Jay.

641
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,114
No problem.

642
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:44,983
Shit ain't right.

643
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,186
You work,
you get paid.

644
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:49,020
That's what
I'm sayin'.

645
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:51,022
I'm gonna say somethin'
to him, a'ight?

646
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:53,359
But, you should,
truth, truth.

647
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,563
What's up, Dee?

648
00:34:57,663 --> 00:34:59,365
What's up, shorty?

649
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:04,970
530, the count
is right, man.

650
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,638
Good.

651
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,907
Re-ups on the way down.

652
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:11,210
Go tell Sterling
be ready for it.

653
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,945
A'ight,
yo, Dee, man.

654
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,482
You know, me and Poot,
we be steady workin'
it, you know?

655
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:19,485
Nothin' sloppy,
no troubles, right?

656
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:21,086
No.

657
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:22,821
And we was wondering,

658
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:26,057
if maybe you could let
a little something
go till payday?

659
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:29,361
'Cause you know
right now, we some
broke-ass niggers, man.

660
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:44,643
Right now, whoever
did our girl

661
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:47,446
also did Boyd and
Leggett a month earlier.

662
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:48,980
"Legg-ett."

663
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,083
And those two are
definitely straight-up
drug executions.

664
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:53,652
No mention of Dee
in either file.

665
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:58,624
But, I did get a fresh
number on Tywanda.

666
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,426
Who?

667
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:01,927
- You know, the girl
who called in on Kresson.
- Oh, right.

668
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:03,128
She put Dee
up for that.

669
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:04,563
Have you seen this?

670
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,267
Hey, Jaybird.

671
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:09,901
Jay:
...and the bear said,

672
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,771
you didn't really
come here to hunt
now, did you?

673
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,406
( laughing )

674
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,243
You see
Saturday's 24s?

675
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:18,644
Sunday morning.

676
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:20,479
Did you see
the one Worden got
on the west side?

677
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,382
John Bailey in a
Kevlar vest lit up by
three separate shooters.

678
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:26,352
Uh, Carey Street, yeah.

679
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:28,387
Yes, you made the
connection with Kresson,

680
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:29,988
you didn't think Bailey
might tie in with the
Barksdale crew?

681
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:32,123
Worden's
on the other shift.

682
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:33,892
I'm trying to work
my murders,

683
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,527
Jesus Christ.

684
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,996
Man:
Tony, line three.

685
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,765
What took you so long?

686
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,200
You might've heard,
we get a few murders
here in Baltimore.

687
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:43,402
Sometimes we
just get backed-up.

688
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:44,936
You weren't followed here?

689
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,472
Why would
we be followed?

690
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:49,741
Diedre was playing
with scary people.

691
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:52,244
Who might
that be?

692
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,683
You know,
you called this in

693
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,518
after the murder
and you told
the detective

694
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,887
that you talked to her
the night she was killed?

695
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:03,722
Tywanda:
Yeah, she called.

696
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:07,025
It was late.
She didn't talk long,
she said she had to go.

697
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,494
Dee was at the door.

698
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:10,228
And that was the last time
you spoke with her?

699
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,831
Yeah, she was
killed that night.

700
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,600
Dee was
her boyfriend?

701
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,537
No, Dee was his
nephew or something.

702
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:21,172
Dee would be
D'Angelo Barksdale?

703
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:23,575
And the boyfriend,
Avon Barksdale?

704
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,611
You know Avon?

705
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,446
The question is
how do you know him?

706
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:29,315
You out there running
the street with the players?

707
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:32,518
I used to be,

708
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:34,953
but not after this
thing with Diedre.

709
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,722
I mean, damn.

710
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:39,358
We used to go to O'Dell's
for ladies nights,

711
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:42,561
and one time he was there
with all his people

712
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:44,463
in one of those big booths,
ordering drinks,

713
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,465
acting like he was
king of everything.

714
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:48,800
And Diedre
ate that shit up.

715
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,002
And you?

716
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,738
I ain't gonna lie.

717
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:56,475
I did the club thing
for a while, but...

718
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:59,478
some of those places,

719
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:01,847
everybody in there's
on some kinda game.

720
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,549
But Diedre went with Avon?

721
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:05,917
She was with Avon
for like a year...

722
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,553
and something happened.

723
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:09,821
Toward the end,
she started to get
real possessive

724
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:12,023
and that didn't sit
with Avon, 'cause he
has other girls, too.

725
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,060
Anyway, she started
bitchin' on him one minute,

726
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,528
cryin' to him next minute,

727
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,096
threatenin' to do
all kinds of things.

728
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:19,398
She threatened
Avon Barksdale?

729
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:21,567
Girl was
off the hook.

730
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:23,835
One time, she threatened
to write a letter on him.

731
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:26,171
A letter?

732
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:28,139
A letter to
the state's attorney.

733
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,176
Supposed to be some
sort of kin to her.

734
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:33,779
She said that
if he dumped her,

735
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:36,382
she was gonna
tell about the drugs.

736
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:37,916
Did she write this letter?

737
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,618
I don't know.

738
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:41,653
I tried talking
to her about the
way she was acting,

739
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:44,623
but she wouldn't
let it go.

740
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:46,291
She even had it out
with him in his club
one night

741
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:47,659
in front of all the people
that were there.

742
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:51,430
- What, Avon has a club?
- Orlando's, a titty bar.

743
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,932
- Does he own it?
- That's what Diedre said.

744
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:57,102
She said he owned
a whole mess of stuff.

745
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:03,341
( music playing )

746
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,721
- Dee: Tell me
something, man.
- Orlando: What's that?

747
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:19,825
How can you run this place
and not just OD on pussy?

748
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:21,159
Shit.

749
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,628
You try dealin'
with all these bitches

750
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:24,095
and they problems
for a few days.

751
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,898
Get so you'd
rather be runnin'
a goddamn laundromat

752
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,067
out this motherfucker.

753
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,169
Heard you doin'
okay in the pit.

754
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:33,271
Yeah, well.

755
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,741
What, you ain't
gettin' it like that?

756
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:38,777
Man, my uncle
still got me
working on salary.

757
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,779
Damn, boy.

758
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,914
You ain't the only one
your uncle keeps close.

759
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,450
What?

760
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,585
Come on, man, you
ain't makin' no ends?

761
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,587
I know you getting
a little something
on this by now.

762
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:51,389
No, man.
I'm just a front,

763
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,692
clean name
for the liquor board.
I'm sayin'--

764
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,661
- Man: What the fuck?
- Woman: Is there a problem?

765
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:57,963
That was for the
drink before.

766
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,831
Man:
It was for this one.

767
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:01,600
I'm saying, it ain't
like I'm callin' your
uncle out or nothin',

768
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,469
but damn,
give a nigger a chance.

769
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:06,137
- Plenty of pie out
there for everybody.
- Believe.

770
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,640
You heard Stinkum
gonna be comin' off
the clock, right?

771
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,141
Gettin' a percentage.

772
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,409
What?

773
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,911
Gonna open up
fresh territory.

774
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:16,748
Take over the corners down
near Edmondson and Brice.

775
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,884
And my uncle
gave that to Stink?

776
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:21,953
- Woman: Orlando.
- Figured you knew.

777
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,590
Orlando!

778
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,892
Excuse me, Orlando, can you
help me down here, please?

779
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,694
Hey, I already paid
for that last drink.

780
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:30,796
Well, that was
for the drink before.

781
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:32,397
Hell, no,
that was for this one.

782
00:40:32,498 --> 00:40:34,332
Orlando: Hey, hey,
what's up here?

783
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,502
Look, he ain't paid for
that drink and I took
$20 off the bar.

784
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:39,004
Look she took 20,
then 20 more.

785
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,071
Hell I did.

786
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,273
Come on, now, why you
gonna do me like this?

787
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,543
I been sittin' here with
you for an hour and a half
buyin' drinks.

788
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:46,377
Look, man,
this ain't right.

789
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:49,414
I just spent $120 in
drinks, $40 in tips.

790
00:40:49,515 --> 00:40:50,616
Now, you gonna
take all that

791
00:40:50,716 --> 00:40:52,484
and still try to sneak
into my pocket?

792
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:54,052
- Shardene: I didn't take...
- Shit, girl.

793
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,654
You got to go.
Get him the fuck
outta here.

794
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:57,388
I ain't done so much
as touch your kneecap.

795
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,791
Tryin' to treat her
with a little bit of respect

796
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,893
and this is
the way you do me?

797
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:04,029
Wait, wait!

798
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:12,771
Okay, now I'm going.

799
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,644
Why you do that?

800
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:22,113
Did you
take his money?

801
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,549
No, I didn't
take his money.

802
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:37,996
You buyin' me
a drink?

803
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,366
Can I see you sometime?

804
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:44,035
Like, you know,
not in here.

805
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,547
I don't usually see men
that I meet in here.

806
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:05,023
Usually.

807
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:13,565
Greggs:
What kinda strip joint has
a video camera looking out?

808
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:16,467
More to it
than the girls, maybe.

809
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:20,171
So, he's got the club,
he's got the warehouse,

810
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,841
he's got the apartment
building by Druid Hill Lake,

811
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:24,743
he's got the
tow truck company.

812
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:26,978
And that's just what
she knew from what
he bragged about

813
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:29,147
to the dead girl.

814
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,849
Major likes assets.

815
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,684
The deputy, too,
I imagine.

816
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:34,485
Nothing like a few
property forfeitures

817
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,221
to swell the departmental
operation budget.

818
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:38,824
Check city assessments
to see who owns the club.

819
00:42:38,924 --> 00:42:40,325
You get a company name,

820
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:41,960
run it through the state
corporate charter office.

821
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,562
Also, homicide picked up
one Saturday night.

822
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:46,097
Might be one of ours.

823
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:48,466
John Bailey,
he's a stick-up artist

824
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,602
I used to know
from the Murphy Homes.

825
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:52,771
He's found wearing Kevlar,
but it didn't help.

826
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:55,440
39 casings on the scene
from three different guns.

827
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,909
Overkill for
a burn bag,

828
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:00,578
but about right if
he was running with Omar.

829
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,247
Look it, our buddy.

830
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:04,215
( pager beeping )

831
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:08,153
( pager beeping )

832
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:17,763
Greggs:
Just once, I wish they'd
use a right number.

833
00:43:23,168 --> 00:43:25,704
Omar:
Ain't like him to be late.

834
00:43:31,677 --> 00:43:35,213
Bailey's a fucking
dope fiend.

835
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:37,148
I'm tellin' ya,

836
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:38,884
them fuckin' people
ain't to be relied on.

837
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:41,586
Hey, yo, why you always
gotta talk like that, man?

838
00:43:41,687 --> 00:43:44,890
- What?
- F-this and f-that.

839
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:46,892
If I give it up,

840
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:50,361
I lose half of
what I mean to say.

841
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:54,099
Don't nobody want to hear
them dirty words, man.

842
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:58,003
Especially coming from
such a beautiful mouth.

843
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:13,752
Brandon:
Wait for Bailey?

844
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,989
Early bird
catch the worm, dog.

845
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:27,332
( baby crying )

846
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:30,068
( dog barking )

847
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,246
( music playing )

848
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,351
- I beeped you.
- I didn't get it.

849
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:47,819
Let me see.

850
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:49,620
You want
to see my pager?

851
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:51,890
Yeah.

852
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,793
Sure, Prez, you want
to see my pager?

853
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,195
I beeped you too.

854
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:58,463
You all right, Prez?

855
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:01,733
7-1-4-3-4-3-2?

856
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,003
I got that.
That was you?

857
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:06,271
You try it?

858
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:07,773
Yeah, I tried it.

859
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:10,108
Twice.
Non-working number.

860
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,443
Would've worked
if you knew the code.

861
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:20,285
Shit,
I'm as surprised as you.

862
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,322
I like
word-search puzzles.

863
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:27,225
You know, where you
gotta find the
hidden words?

864
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:28,693
So, I thought

865
00:45:28,794 --> 00:45:31,729
I could do the
same thing with
the numbers.

866
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,233
Take the number
I sent you.

867
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:37,535
Now, take the seven

868
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:39,337
and jump it over the five.

869
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:40,538
You get three.

870
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:42,273
Jump the one over the five,

871
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:44,542
you get nine.

872
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:46,912
With four
you get six.

873
00:45:47,012 --> 00:45:50,615
Three, that's seven,
four is six,

874
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:52,583
a three again,

875
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,686
and two is eight.

876
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:57,789
Zero switches
with the five.

877
00:45:57,889 --> 00:45:59,690
So, seven, one, four,

878
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,526
three, four, three, two

879
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:03,995
is three, nine, six,

880
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,264
seven, six,
seven, eight.

881
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:08,033
Our number.

882
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:11,469
And that's the code?

883
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,071
Yeah, and it works

884
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:16,241
because it's all about where
the buttons are on a phone.

885
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:18,576
If it was a code
that involved math

886
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:20,812
or algebra or whatever,

887
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:22,047
these little
yo's in the projects

888
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:24,615
wouldn't be
able to follow along.

889
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:28,086
But with this, all you gotta
do is jump the five button.

890
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:30,856
Ain't no math to it.
It's just...

891
00:46:30,956 --> 00:46:32,390
how a phone looks
when you look at it.

892
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,560
Prez,
you little genius!

893
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,063
Jesus.

894
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:40,331
I could kill you,
that's so good.

895
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:46,204
Your mother keep raggin'
at me to take him out of here

896
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,805
and put him in
a private nursing home.

897
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:50,008
Yeah, well,

898
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:52,310
you know, she ain't
never gonna let that go.

899
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,712
I keep telling her, man,
hey, we can't show

900
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:55,981
this legit
money yet, man.

901
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:57,715
Especially since he
ain't got no insurance.

902
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,318
- ( pager beeping )
- Soon, though, soon.

903
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:01,319
Yeah, well...

904
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:04,555
So, you ain't big
on comin' here, right?

905
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,357
Naw.

906
00:47:07,893 --> 00:47:09,360
Tell you somethin', man,

907
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,129
you about to see your uncle,
you understand me?

908
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:13,298
- This family.
- I know.

909
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:15,433
Family is what count,
family is what it's about.

910
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:18,870
Family gonna always be there
'cause it's blood.

911
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,272
( man screaming )

912
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:34,886
Man.

913
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:47,065
You never figured
on this, did you?

914
00:47:50,135 --> 00:47:51,769
Live the life,
lead the life.

915
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,538
Ain't no big thing.

916
00:47:53,638 --> 00:47:56,041
He used to talk
that shit all the time
and he believed it,

917
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:57,308
you know what
I'm sayin'?

918
00:47:57,408 --> 00:48:00,311
What's up, baby?
Talk that shit now.

919
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,449
You know,
you're right.

920
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:08,486
It's kinda hard to be
in here right now.

921
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:10,121
He scare you,
don't he?

922
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,958
You know,
I'm just sayin'...

923
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:16,361
He scares me.

924
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:20,898
Yeah.

925
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:24,469
See, if he dead, you know,
I could carry it better.

926
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:27,238
Comin' up the way we did,
you kinda expect that.

927
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:30,775
You waitin' on it.

928
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,978
See,

929
00:48:33,078 --> 00:48:35,981
the thing is, you only
got to fuck up once.

930
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:40,651
Be a little slow,
be a little late,

931
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,553
just once.

932
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:47,325
And how you ain't gonna
never be slow,

933
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,294
never be late?

934
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:53,764
You can't plan for no shit
like this, man.

935
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,933
It's life.

936
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:01,639
Yeah.

937
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,645
Scares me.

938
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:23,028
Greggs:
They're still using it.

939
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:24,996
I was by on Saturday night
and it was gone.

940
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:27,398
On your own time?

941
00:49:29,034 --> 00:49:31,136
You still
gettin' your boys?

942
00:49:31,236 --> 00:49:34,339
Yeah, tonight
for a sleep-over.

943
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:36,207
We're on.

944
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:52,657
What the hell?

945
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:54,659
Call for backup?

946
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:56,361
Not yet.

947
00:49:56,461 --> 00:49:59,530
Let's see
how it plays out.

948
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,384
An invitation.

949
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:22,320
- Feel a little
lonesome for backup.
- Yeah, me, too.

950
00:50:24,089 --> 00:50:26,057
That's nice.

951
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:28,359
- I'll check the van.
- I'll watch the boys.

952
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:41,739
Afternoon,
gentlemen.

953
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,575
Omar: Sayin' if you were
gonna use that you would've
been done using it by now.

954
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:51,982
Greggs:
It's clean.

955
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,418
Omar:
Got to keep it clean.

956
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:56,121
Sayin' we having one of
our little parlays like this,

957
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:57,922
got to keep it
clean, right?

958
00:50:58,022 --> 00:50:59,957
Omar with no gun
on the street?

959
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,559
Must be
a first.

960
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:04,262
Yeah, sometimes
who you are is enough, dog.

961
00:51:04,362 --> 00:51:06,764
But being as y'all
sitting on my ride so long,

962
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:08,499
I thought I'd save
y'all some time.

963
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:11,102
Come straight on out.
I ain't takin' no charge.

964
00:51:11,202 --> 00:51:12,437
And y'all ain't putting me
back up in no cage.

965
00:51:12,537 --> 00:51:14,939
We're not here
to bury you, Omar.

966
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:17,708
We're pulling you
up because we got
a problem in common.

967
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,610
- Problem?
- Barksdale.

968
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,078
Naw, he ain't no problem.

969
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:22,913
I don't know.

970
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,615
Avon's been chalking up
a lot of bodies.

971
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:26,217
And you being you...

972
00:51:26,317 --> 00:51:28,519
Put it that way, I guess
he could be a little problem,

973
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,989
but, uh, I just can't really
come out and help y'all.

974
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,024
You know what I mean?
Snitchin'?

975
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:35,826
Just rubs me wrong.

976
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,996
Personally, I don't think
the game is played like that.

977
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,866
We respect that.

978
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:44,935
If you do happen
to take a charge though,

979
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,571
I'm McNulty,
that's Greggs.

980
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:47,805
You give us a call,

981
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:49,039
we'll sort
something out.

982
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,142
Fair enough.

983
00:51:52,177 --> 00:51:53,444
You know, I used
to work the Homes

984
00:51:53,544 --> 00:51:56,847
back when your brother
was up there.

985
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:01,219
You get a chance,
let him know they blew up
John Bailey last night.

986
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,623
Good man.
Lot of enemies.

987
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:08,359
Mm-hmm.

988
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,928
I'm saying you trying
to catch up with Bird?

989
00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:14,064
Word is he dropped
a working man.

990
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:16,301
Hey, wait, hold up.

991
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:18,303
C'mon, don't play me.

992
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:20,371
What working man,
what Bird?

993
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:22,707
C'mon, now, ain't but one
working man, now is there?

994
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:25,042
And Bird?

995
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,945
I think your snitch
can handle that.

996
00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:30,181
Shit, Bubbles know Bird.

997
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:49,200
( doorbell rings )

998
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:06,817
( birds chirping )

999
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:15,993
- ( knocking )
- You workin' late?

1000
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:17,795
- A little.
- Got a minute?

1001
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:19,964
Sure, have a seat.

1002
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:23,668
No, this is better
said standing up.

1003
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:26,070
You know, I've been
13 years on the shelf.

1004
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:29,173
I ain't bitched.
It was me that
put me there.

1005
00:53:29,274 --> 00:53:33,344
But I'm here now,
and I gotta say a peace.

1006
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:35,913
We should've
had a tap

1007
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:38,283
on the project
pay phones by now.

1008
00:53:38,383 --> 00:53:40,551
A wire there will
get us the drugs.

1009
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:43,354
Keep pushing, we'll get
a whiff of the money, too.

1010
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:46,657
Now, I know you're serious about
climbing that career ladder,

1011
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:49,694
and I know how slippery
it gets the higher you go,

1012
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:51,496
but for me,

1013
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:55,566
I don't want to go
to no dance unless
I can rub some tit.

1014
00:53:56,434 --> 00:53:58,803
I appreciate your honesty.

1015
00:54:00,305 --> 00:54:02,673
Goodnight,
Lieutenant.

1016
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:29,166
So, what you say
to make Dee pay out?

1017
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,337
I told him to give it up
or I'm gonna take it
out of the count.

1018
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:33,638
- Shit.
- Yo, look.

1019
00:54:33,738 --> 00:54:36,874
I'll punk niggers
when I got to.

1020
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,445
Damn.

1021
00:54:46,817 --> 00:54:48,719
- Hey, yo, that's him.
- That's who?

1022
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:50,455
One of the ones
that robbed us.

1023
00:54:50,555 --> 00:54:52,457
That light-skinned boy.

1024
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:55,893
That's him?

1025
00:54:55,993 --> 00:54:57,762
All right, c'mon.

1026
00:55:03,668 --> 00:55:05,736
Brandon:
I'm the king of this shit.

1027
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:22,887
( phone ringing )

1028
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,092
Wallace:
So you want us to wait?

1029
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,428
Yeah.

1030
00:56:03,528 --> 00:56:04,995
Wallace:
A'ight, we on him, man.

1031
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,431
All right.

1032
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:15,072
( computer beeps )

1033
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,009
( dog barking )

1034
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:23,180
There goes Scar
right there.

1035
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,982
Bird:
Right there
in the blue?

1036
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:26,216
Number 80?

1037
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:27,685
- Yup.
- I'm on him.

1038
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:35,426
( computer beeping )

1039
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:46,236
- ( pager beeps )
- All right, you got,
you got him?

1040
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:47,972
Hey, yo, find a phone
real quick.

1041
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:49,474
What's up?

1042
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:51,141
It look like my man Dee
got himself an emergency.

1043
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,177
What, he been
stuck up again?

1044
00:56:53,277 --> 00:56:54,712
( laughing )

1045
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,649
( dog barking )

1046
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:03,888
( phone ringing )

1047
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:06,423
Bell:
Yo, what's up?
What you need?

1048
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:08,959
My people on one of Omar's
boys down the Greek's.

1049
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,028
Bell:
Oh, word?

1050
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:13,831
- All right, sit tight,
I'm gonna take care of it.
- All right.

1051
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,900
( computer beeps )

1052
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,375
Ain't nobody coming.

1053
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:27,311
Yo, Dee said wait.

1054
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:29,113
Dee said wait.

1055
00:57:42,092 --> 00:57:43,794
Told you.

1056
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:52,537
Yo, he still
in there?

1057
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:54,839
Yeah, he in there
playin' the games.

1058
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:57,407
All right.
You sharp, son.
What's your name?

1059
00:57:57,508 --> 00:58:00,077
- Wallace.
- Wallace? All right.

1060
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:03,213
This nigger
gonna point him out
to us, all right?

1061
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:21,398
( phone ringing )

1062
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,400
- Yeah.
- Bell: Yo, it's done.

1063
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,135
Nice work, cuz.

1064
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,071
All right.

1065
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:42,052
( computer beeping )

1066
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:53,197
( theme music playing )

OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,000
What's up?

3
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,100
Great view.

4
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,300
Harbor, I mean.

5
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,300
It's fucking picturesque, is what it is.

6
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,500
Every morning I ask myself,
"Is today the day I drive down...

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,700
"to Fort Armistead, stare out at the harbor?"

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,500
No, I figure eventually,
if I mind my own business...

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,500
Uncle Frank will wake my ass up
at 7:00 in the morning...

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,500
tell me to get my ass down there
for some mysterious fucking reason.

11
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,300
Good anchorage, good cranes...

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,300
good railroads, close to l-95.
Lot of people ready to work, right?

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,400
That's my fucking town.

14
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,400
Except, the thing is,
we're another 1 10 miles...

15
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,400
for any ship coming up
from Hampton Roads. An extra day.

16
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,900
So why come?

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,900
Unless you know your cargo's
gonna move...

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
fast and clean through the port.

19
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,900
Why offload in Baltimore,
except that a Baltimore gang...

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,800
can turn your ship around
faster than any other port...

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,700
and will make sure your cargo...

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,400
all your cargo, gets where it needs to go
faster than anywhere else.

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,900
Like you guys never stole nothing
back in the day.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,300
We ain't back in the day, Nicky.

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
When was the last time
you saw trucks backed up for three miles...

26
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,800
outside Patapsco terminal?

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,800
If it wasn't for the car-ships,
we would be starving.

28
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,400
The cameras come back.

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm serious.

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,600
They come back today, we tell the shipper
we lost the can in the stacks.

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,500
They're gone. We turned them over already.

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
To who?

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,100
You know the Tasco line's a cunt hair away
from taking their business down to Norfolk.

34
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,700
-I don't need this shit right now.
-I do, Uncle Frank, I need the money.

35
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,700
-You ain't hearing me!
-What? You think this shit is easy?

36
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,300
You think it's fucking easy?
You try living on five or six days a month.

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,000
See how fast it puts you on your ass.
I am on my ass, Uncle Frank.

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,800
You need money, you come to me.

39
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,100
Frankie Sobotka is
Father fucking Christmas...

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,600
on the docks lately.

41
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,800
-No doubt, his pockets are full.
-You think it's for me?

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,500
Is that what you think?

43
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
It ain't about me, Nick!

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I know, I'm sorry.

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,800
You got Ziggy mixed up in this.
Jesus, Nick, what the fuck are you thinking?

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,100
Me and Zig are gonna talk on this
long and hard.

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,900
Come on, let's go to work.

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,500
How much?

49
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,600
Twenty.

50
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,000
-Three-way split.
-Who's the inside man?

51
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,200
You don't know?

52
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,600
Fuck you then, I ain't no snitch.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,400
Nobody should flash too much money.
You know that much, right?

54
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
Yeah.

55
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,700
Toxicology's coming back positive
for strychnine.

56
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,300
10%, 12%. It's pretty well laced.

57
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,900
This was intentional?

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,400
That's the ME's call, but I've seen
street packages cut all the time...

59
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,700
with all kinds of chemicals.

60
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,700
You don't use too much,
you give a weak package some kick.

61
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,700
People start thinking you're high-grade,
when what you got is...

62
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,500
stepped-on trash
with a little bit of rat poison mixed in.

63
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,300
Too much rat poison,
you got people falling out, like we got.

64
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,800
Be nice to have a few answers
for those reporters.

65
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,000
What do they wanna know?

66
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,400
How it got in, what we're doing, the usual.

67
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,100
It got in like everything gets in.

68
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,900
If you can't win
the war on drugs in a prison...

69
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
where the hell you gonna win it? I ask you.

70
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,800
Listen, if it were one or two dead,
it would fade.

71
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,700
But five in one night,
and eight more in the infirmary?

72
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,300
We need to show the flag on this.

73
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
What I'm gonna need is for you all
to wheel and deal.

74
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,200
What do you mean?

75
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,500
If this case gets made from an informant...

76
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,100
and you're gonna have
a couple dozen of them...

77
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,500
if you're ready to shave some years.

78
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,800
Colonel.

79
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,700
-Jimmy.
-Winona.

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,900
Gilligan, little buddy.

81
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,700
Don't you have a job?

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Ouch!

83
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
I smell fresh police work.

84
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,500
Okay, be like that.

85
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,700
You got some paper from inside the can?

86
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,100
A letter, couple of envelopes,
some scraps of stuff?

87
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,400
Yeah, everything's down
in your evidence control.

88
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,200
-You got the submission slips?
-He does.

89
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,500
-Lester.
-You want to pull all of it?

90
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,000
Hold it.

91
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,200
Before you start dancing
with your Jane Doe...

92
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,100
I'm gonna need a little something from you
on the Gant case.

93
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,300
I got a full set of llene Nathan's teeth marks
on my hind parts.

94
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,800
-No problem, I got you covered.
-You found Omar?

95
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,000
I never lost him, my friend.

96
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,100
-He's got Omar?
-Bullshit.

97
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,500
Who's Omar?

98
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,700
My papers are in.

99
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,800
They are.

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,300
You want out, you're out.

101
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,700
But I'm offering to clean the slate here.

102
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,000
-You and me.
-Why?

103
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,700
The council vote is next week,
after which I'm upstairs.

104
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,200
Now, if I'm gonna give myself a chance...

105
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,600
to make my mark on this place,
I'll need good people.

106
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,200
People you can trust.

107
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,300
And you ain't that?

108
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,900
All right. You're a snake.

109
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,500
But you seem to know your business.

110
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,100
I'm taking the bar exam in a month.

111
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,600
Why not put it off for a year or two...

112
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,600
Ieave the department
with a major's pension?

113
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,800
Scalise is gonna retire this summer.

114
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,100
You do me a good turn
on this detail in southeast...

115
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,500
and you'll have that posting.

116
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,400
Why would you do that?

117
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,200
I value you, Cedric.

118
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,600
You're arrogant and disloyal.

119
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,400
But maybe, given time,
you'll find a way to shine.

120
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,500
-What's the detail?
-Drug case, probably.

121
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,400
My sense of it is that Stan Valchek has got...

122
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,700
some personal issues with somebody
in one of the port unions.

123
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
He thinks they've got too much money.

124
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,900
And so, being Valchek, he gets a detail.

125
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
That it? Pretty thin.

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,700
I don't care if you make a case
for Valchek or not.

127
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,000
I do care that the old Polack
comes away from it...

128
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,500
feeling he got his money's worth.

129
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,000
Valchek asked for me by name, didn't he?

130
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,200
You two are trading horses
and you need me in the corral.

131
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,200
How about this?

132
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,100
If I bring in the case...

133
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,500
you make the detail permanent
as a major case unit...

134
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,100
within CID.

135
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,500
Fair enough.

136
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,300
Just keep Valchek stroked
and make sure you bring in...

137
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
-a drug case or two.
-One other thing.

138
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,900
A promotion and the promise
of a specialized unit isn't enough?

139
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,500
I choose my own people.

140
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,700
Fuck me once, shame on you.

141
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,300
-Fuck me twice--
-Make a list.

142
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,500
Give it to Rawls. He'll pull who you want.

143
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,700
The shit do not make sense.
Some of them wasn't about nothing.

144
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,600
I mean, Tae? Lizard? lf it was a hotshot...

145
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,500
they were after
some real lightweight motherfucks.

146
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,000
Yo, Dee, you want any Silver Surfers?

147
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,600
They tossing shit Tae had in his cell, man.

148
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,200
Whoever load that shit up
didn't know what he was doing.

149
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,400
My boy down the infirmary say the shit
was more rat poison than it was dope.

150
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,400
Fucking-A right.

151
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,600
Jane Doe, number five.

152
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,400
Five.

153
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,400
What's up, baby?

154
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,600
Not here, put it away.

155
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
Shot and a beer, darling.

156
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,800
Kept one for yourself, did you?

157
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,600
Them Japs, they make a nice little camera,
they do.

158
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,000
-You even got film in that bitch?
-No, it's digital.

159
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,100
I know it's digital, so what?

160
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,600
So, no film, look,
there's a computer chip inside.

161
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,800
You take that off,
you load the pictures onto the computer.

162
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,000
Thanks.

163
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,300
Ziggy.

164
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,500
Don't spread no cash around
for a while, all right?

165
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,200
Hell, no.

166
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,700
I might get a new clutch plate
put in Princess is all.

167
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,000
-Also, your father knows.
-How does he know?

168
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,800
Horse saw us, right?

169
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,200
Fuck me, he told?

170
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,300
How long has Horse been tight
with your pop? Of course he told.

171
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
He's pissed, Zig. He ain't happy.

172
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,000
What did you say?

173
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,900
I told him we already
turned the cameras around...

174
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,400
and after a while, he stopped yelling.

175
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,200
At you, maybe.

176
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Anyway.

177
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,000
It's low profile for a while, all right?

178
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,300
All right.

179
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,000
You take a picture on that,
you don't have to take it to photomart...

180
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,200
-to get it turned around?
-No, it goes on a computer.

181
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,600
I got to take a leak.

182
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,900
I go next, all right?

183
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,300
Pretty boy. Hey, there.

184
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,500
Christ, Ziggy.

185
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,000
Jimmy, just a scheduling thing.

186
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,100
Sean was invited to Mark Lohrman's
birthday party on Saturday.

187
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,000
So you can pick him up there after 2:00.

188
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,500
I realize it's your weekend,
but Sean would be upset if he missed it.

189
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay? Great.

190
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,200
Omar by the end of the week, Jimmy.
Ilene is on the warpath.

191
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,600
Motherfucker, I am serious.

192
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,300
Mr. McNulty, this is Dr. Halpern's office.

193
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,500
You missed your six-month cleaning
on Tuesday...

194
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,800
and we haven't heard from you.

195
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,500
Give us a call, please.

196
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,900
McNulty, this is your dear friend
llene Nathan.

197
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,900
I indicted this piece-of-shit case...

198
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,800
because you swore to me
we had an eyeball witness....

199
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,100
Drive time is 6:38 in the a.m.
and we have reports of a....

200
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,700
-Go around, asshole.
-What'd you call me?

201
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,900
I'm sleeping on this side.

202
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,800
Because you got to get up, everybody does?

203
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,900
Yup.

204
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,800
Wipe off the seat, Nick, I know you hit it.

205
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,900
-If I could fart now, I would.
-That's a surprise.

206
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
No chance for breakfast?

207
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,100
No. I'll stop by the bar.

208
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,400
No, you won't. You ain't got time.

209
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,800
You got to run me past my ma's
to pick up Ashley.

210
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,100
Shit, hurry up, then.
You know I got a ship to work today.

211
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,300
Your ma knows you got a ship, too.

212
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,200
Don't go upstairs. Just head out the back.

213
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,300
I'll pick you up at the back
of the alley, all right?

214
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,200
Jesus, Nicky, we got a kid together.

215
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,400
What's the big deal we spend the night
in your folks' basement?

216
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,400
They're decent people.

217
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,400
-We ain't got time.
-I know.

218
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,300
-So, why you grabbing?
-They were staring right at me.

219
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,600
I'll meet you out back.

220
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,200
So how do you get the container
off the ship, off the dock?

221
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,800
I guess if you wanted
to make sure your cargo...

222
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,000
isn't messed with, you'd want to get
with one of the checkers.

223
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
-Who are they?
-Local 1514.

224
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,400
They monitor
all the loading and offloading...

225
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,100
they match the manifests,
they tally the cargo.

226
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,000
Nothing goes in or out
without them putting it down somewhere.

227
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,700
-Or not.
-Or not.

228
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
So we need to talk to a checker.

229
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,300
What?

230
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Black, white, Polish, lrish, ltalian,
it doesn't matter.

231
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,600
No one talks to police.

232
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,600
How do you make a case then?

233
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,900
I patrol.

234
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,800
I write traffic tickets.

235
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,900
If we got an open container,
or a damaged container...

236
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,300
I take a report.

237
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,700
We got something stolen,
I take another report.

238
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,300
Someone gets something dropped on him
or gets run over by a front-end loader...

239
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,500
-I keep writing.
-That's the job?

240
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,300
How long you been on?

241
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,400
-Two years.
-What did you do before that?

242
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,400
I took tolls from people
at the Fort McHenry tunnel.

243
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,700
Which, I'm happy to say,
wasn't nearly as much fun.

244
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,400
Made $22,500
and went home tired every night...

245
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,000
until I walked by the office bulletin board
one night...

246
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,600
read the MDOT job posting.

247
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,800
Port Authority officers, Schedule one,
starting at $33,000 with benefits.

248
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,500
Toll-taking days were over?

249
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,600
Father of my two kids
went to Houston in '99...

250
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,500
hasn't so much as called in three years.

251
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,400
I wasn't gonna make it on $22,500.

252
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,200
Not with kids, I wasn't.

253
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,400
Did you want to be a police?

254
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,600
-Could've been me the other night.
-True.

255
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,300
Except for all of a sudden,
you up and tell me to stop doing that.

256
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,900
Avon to the rescue. How did you know?

257
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,300
I figured you were gonna be
bringing your ass in here...

258
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
to thank me for pulling you off of that shit.

259
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,300
Five dead. More in the infirmary.

260
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,600
-How did you know?
-I did as your uncle should...

261
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,800
because I'm concerned about
you fucking yourself up.

262
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,700
You knew.

263
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,100
Look, man, I ain't had nothing to do with it.

264
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,600
I might know who did, though.

265
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,300
You practically running this place.
Who else could it be?

266
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,300
It ain't about what happened,
you understand?

267
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,200
It's about using what happened
to our advantage.

268
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,000
Play or you gonna get played.

269
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,200
I need to know that you ain't do that shit.

270
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,500
That's what I need to know.

271
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,800
I already said it.
You ain't gonna believe it, fuck it.

272
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,000
You can tell yourself that I spiked it,
but be grateful that you still standing.

273
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,600
Once you done with all that...

274
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,700
we can talk about how we start
shaving some of these years off.

275
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,500
And not just for me, for you, too.

276
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,600
They looking for the motherfucker
who brought that shit in here.

277
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,500
They need him to fall. And you know what?

278
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,600
I can give you a name.
I can give you the right name.

279
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,500
We can take that name
down to the assistant warden...

280
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,100
and we can get some of our lives back.

281
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,100
You dig?

282
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,900
So, stay close.

283
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,400
This play on the inside,
this play on the outside...

284
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,400
we got it all covered.

285
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,200
I don't want no part of what you do no more.
You hear me?

286
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,800
So you can just leave me
the fuck out of that.

287
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,400
Whatever it is.

288
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,900
Anyone seen Omar?

289
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,500
We're back in!

290
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,600
Six ships in one day.

291
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,400
Ain't seen the terminal this busy in months.
Feels sweet.

292
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,700
Shit, look at this pretty bitch.

293
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,700
-What the fuck are you wearing?
-Italian leather, all right?

294
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
In the middle of winter?
On the goddamn docks?

295
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,500
-How much does that shit cost?
-$2,000.

296
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,600
For a goddamn jacket?
Are you out your fucking mind, Zig?

297
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,300
Fuck it.

298
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,800
$2,000 for a single goddamn jacket.

299
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,500
Jesus, Zig, you need therapy and shit.

300
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,300
I figured an African-American
such as yourself would understand...

301
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,700
how a player such as myself
needs to take heed in the latest fashion.

302
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,000
But apparently,
you ain't got no fucking style neither.

303
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,900
-I'm gonna walk, all right?
-See you.

304
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
What?

305
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,100
What did I tell you about
not spreading no cash around?

306
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,100
Jesus Christ, Nicky, it's a fucking coat.

307
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,000
I can tell people I'm paying for it
on installments or whatever.

308
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,100
But you got to admit, I do look pretty today.

309
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,300
I do.

310
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,400
The Greeks wanna talk to us.

311
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,900
What about?

312
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,300
We did good by them.

313
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,900
Yeah?

314
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,600
But, for Christ sakes, Zig,
keep your shit quiet...

315
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,600
before half the fucking waterfront's
talking about us.

316
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,400
All right, no problem.

317
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,500
-All right. See you later.
-See you.

318
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,300
Yo, quit it.

319
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
Gentlemen.

320
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,900
We don't need that now.

321
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,200
-Say what?
-I don't give a shit about drugs.

322
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,600
Littering pisses me off, though.
You can pick that up when I'm gone.

323
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,300
I'm looking for a stick-up boy,
name of Omar.

324
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,700
Dark-skinned, thin guy
with a scar right down his face.

325
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,500
You boys would definitely know him
if you saw him...

326
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,900
because he's got a shotgun about yea-long.

327
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,500
He'll put it to your head
and steal your shit without thinking twice.

328
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,300
Does anyone know where he hangs?

329
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,200
Who he's running with?

330
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,900
What he's driving?

331
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,200
Fuck you, Officer.

332
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,000
The second package came
even weaker than the last.

333
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,900
It won't take the cut like it did before.

334
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,100
Fucking Atlanta shit cost more
and still not as good.

335
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,700
Came in at 25.

336
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
All we can do is sprinkle it and bag it.

337
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,200
And lose my money?

338
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,100
I lose my money.

339
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,900
Step on that motherfucker.

340
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,200
How hard?

341
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,100
Make it 10.

342
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,300
-It's shit now.
-I know.

343
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,600
So the container itself leads us nowhere.
Fake addresses on either end.

344
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,000
Which leaves us the port itself.

345
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Because whatever went wrong
on that ship was known to whoever...

346
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,300
was supposed to pick that container up.

347
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Which is why it stays on the dock.

348
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,200
Bottom line is, we need to know more
about cargo moving off that terminal.

349
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,300
How to do dirt.
And how to hide when you're doing dirt.

350
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Bottom line for me is different.

351
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,000
Bottom line for me is,
you guys should've held that ship.

352
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,400
For your crime scene, for your witnesses,
for the whole damn case.

353
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,600
Sir, the witnesses--

354
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,200
I don't care if they were
speaking Mandarin Chinese...

355
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,700
with a cocksucker's lisp.

356
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,300
They needed to see the inside of
an interrogation room. They were the case.

357
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,900
We were in Philadelphia,
with no real jurisdiction...

358
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,800
dealing with foreign nationals
and no real probable cause.

359
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,300
I can only tell you
what it looks like from where I sit.

360
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,800
And from here, the view is
two of my detectives fucking the dog.

361
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,400
Thirteen homicides, 14, if we connect
the floater, and all of them red.

362
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,600
So what can I tell you?

363
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,000
If this case doesn't fall,
we're all gonna be stepping on our dicks...

364
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,700
trying to explain what happened.

365
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,600
So, work it as you see fit...

366
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,100
but understand...

367
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,400
if I have to throw Burrell
a scapegoat or two...

368
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,200
I got one to throw.

369
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,700
Fuck me.

370
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,500
What did you want to talk to us about?

371
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,100
If you are able to do like you did,
we have other things we can use.

372
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,100
Like what?

373
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,700
Fact is, we shook things up down there
snatching all them cameras.

374
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,500
It comes to expensive shit like that,
we got to lay back for a while.

375
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Stuff we need is not like that.

376
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
No?

377
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,400
Acetone, sulfuric acid,
potassium permanganate.

378
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,400
-Chemicals?
-It's like paint thinner, shit like that.

379
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,900
What do you need with those?
Just go get them at the hardware store.

380
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,300
No. We need much.

381
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,300
Metric tons. Five or ten tons.

382
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,100
Check and you'll see,
they make these things here.

383
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,600
Send them from here.
Tanks and tanks down at your docks.

384
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,400
Good money for those.

385
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,900
How much?

386
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,500
How much chemical? Two tons? Four?

387
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
-Eight?
-I'll look into it.

388
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,500
Yo, Bubbles!

389
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,100
McNulty.

390
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,200
My meanest man.

391
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,000
Get in the car.

392
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,300
Where you been at, brother?

393
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,600
What did you get? Walkman.

394
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,700
You know how it works, Bubs.
You're going to pay taxes on this shit.

395
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,100
Taxation without representation, you know?

396
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,500
I don't want much. I need Omar.

397
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,800
Wild Omar?

398
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,000
You want us to wander around town...

399
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,800
Iooking for a crazy motherfucker
with a shotgun?

400
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,100
Him and me go way back,
it's a friendly thing.

401
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,900
If he's a friend,
you can find the motherfucker without us.

402
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,700
No problem. Show me the receipt
for this shit, you're off the hook.

403
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,000
-Here.
-Keep it, part of my tax.

404
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,500
Your tax is Omar.

405
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,200
I need a line by Friday, Bubs.

406
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
Fuck!

407
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,000
My client will provide accurate information
as to the source of the tainted narcotics.

408
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,100
My client will provide accurate information
as to the source of the tainted narcotics.

409
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,100
He can identify the method
by which contraband is smuggled...

410
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,800
into this institution,
as well as the people responsible.

411
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,500
Cellblock talk is cheap.

412
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,600
He'll give you what you need
to make a case...

413
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,600
-if that's what you're interested in.
-Your terms?

414
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,500
Mr. Barksdale is due
for a first parole hearing at 28 months.

415
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,400
We'd like to trim that to a year...

416
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,900
and have your assurances
of institutional support...

417
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,100
for work release and early parole.

418
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,000
One year on a seven-year bit?

419
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,000
We are offering extraordinary cooperation
in this matter.

420
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,300
Mr. Barksdale's placing himself at risk...

421
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,900
by offering information
implicating other prisoners...

422
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,600
and staff at MCl.

423
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,100
And I would only add that
Mr. Barksdale's extant conviction is his first.

424
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,000
He has no priors whatsoever.

425
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,900
It's my recollection that a city police
got shot behind Mr. Barksdale's business.

426
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,400
-No, sir.
-You don't remember that?

427
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,800
I remember the officer got shot.

428
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,700
And I remember being upset about that,
not only because the officer got shot...

429
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,800
but because I knew it meant
there was gonna be more police on me.

430
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,500
I remember thinking, "Any time any fool
do something like shoot a police...

431
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,800
"it's bad on everyone."

432
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,200
I know that you know
that my name ain't nowhere...

433
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,600
on what happened to your friend.

434
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,700
I think what we're asking is reasonable
under the circumstances.

435
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,600
After all, until someone identifies the source
of the tainted heroin...

436
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,400
you could have
another five overdoses tomorrow.

437
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,900
Or the day after.

438
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,400
Consider the offer.

439
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,500
But the next time we talk...

440
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,500
an assistant attorney general
has to be in the room.

441
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,200
Tuna surprise?

442
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,600
Christ sakes, Ma,
I climbed all over two ships today.

443
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,700
How about a meal for that kind of day?

444
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,000
-Where's Pop?
-He's at the bar with the horses.

445
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,100
Go tell him it's dinner.

446
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,400
-We winning, Pop?
-Nicko.

447
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,500
You up today?

448
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:11,500
I was doing good,
but this year Gulfstream is killing me.

449
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,100
Go easy. That's my inheritance.

450
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,700
After 25 years, I'm still ahead almost $7,000.

451
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,600
You ought to let me take you up to Pimlico
when it opens.

452
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,600
Try your system out for real.

453
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,200
Too tempting.

454
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,000
Just once.

455
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Saw that the Cape Spruance
is over at Point West.

456
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,400
Yeah, we offloaded her today.

457
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,700
You know we double-hulled her
down at number four.

458
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,200
Maybe two years before
the dry dock closed up.

459
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,900
She still floats?

460
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,200
Of course she still floats.

461
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,100
You ever miss it, Pop?

462
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,400
You ever miss it, Pop?

463
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,600
Wouldn't do no good.

464
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,000
What's for dinner?

465
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,400
Tuna surprise.

466
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,600
You're loyal to your people.
I respect that, at least.

467
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,600
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

468
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,100
Burrell wants you on this detail,
so I want you, too.

469
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,600
I need your approval
for Freamon, Greggs, and Hauk.

470
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,500
-They're all CID.
-Correction.

471
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,000
You need my approval for everyone.
This may be Valchek's creation...

472
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,100
but the detail is investigative
and comes under CID.

473
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,100
If they work for me, they need my okay.

474
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,300
Good news is, I got no problem
with anyone on your list.

475
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,500
Except McNulty. No McNulty.

476
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,600
Nothing that even resembles
the son of a bitch.

477
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,700
-That bad?
-He quits or he drowns.

478
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,100
That's the only two things get him
off the fucking boat, so help me God.

479
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,800
You even know what
this detail's about, Lieutenant?

480
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,700
Some kind of beef that Valchek has.

481
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,500
Two fucking Polacks
pissing on each other's leg.

482
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,200
I heard.

483
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,700
Anything to get you
out of the basement, Lieutenant?

484
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,800
Girl.

485
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,400
No! Kima, who cares?

486
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,600
We're gonna be there in five minutes
and they'll still be dumbass frat boys.

487
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,400
You got to start thinking,
what would a lawyer do?

488
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,400
What would a lawyer say?

489
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,700
Shakima Greggs, Esquire.

490
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,800
That's what I'm talking about.

491
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,000
-Get your ass down, fool.
-Fuck you, lady.

492
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,800
Ain't no lady.

493
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,700
-Bitch, drive it or lose it.
-Oh, my God, let's get out of here.

494
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,400
Only the finest breeds can perform this well,
with this much heart and obedience.

495
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,000
Obedience that brings out the champion
not only in show dogs....

496
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,700
Look at that tiger go. A third generation
champion from Glassport.

497
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,700
Even house pets that never knew
they had the blood of champions in them.

498
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,600
To perform at this level...

499
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,300
an animal has to follow orders
without question.

500
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,500
It is not instinct.

501
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,800
Come on upstairs.

502
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,700
All dogs have instinct.

503
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,200
Jesus Christ.

504
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,300
Nothing's on this side. Most chemicals
are over at the Fairfield terminals.

505
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,200
Who do we know at Fairfield?

506
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,700
Ott's brother-in-law works there.
You might try and touch him.

507
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,900
What do they want with those for, anyway?

508
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Beats the fuck out of me.

509
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,700
-Jesus, I'm sorry.
-Fuck, man, shit.

510
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,900
I didn't see you standing there
in all that sweet leather.

511
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,500
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-Clumsy, I guess.

512
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,600
You can just go out
and steal a whole can full of baby wipes...

513
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,500
and just clean yourself up.

514
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,600
You fucking goof.

515
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,600
Dick.

516
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,000
Shit, Lieutenant, I promised.

517
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,100
Think my woman's gonna give
a great big cheer when she hears about it?

518
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,800
-I was out the damn door.
-You don't know Cheryl.

519
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,500
You don't know Marla.

520
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,300
If you want...

521
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,100
I could use you inside,
like we did Prez last year.

522
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,400
If I hear the music, I'm gonna dance.

523
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,100
I'll tell your wife, if you tell mine.

524
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,900
In the car, but not out in the open.

525
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,400
Yo, Rock.

526
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,000
Be subtle with it, man.

527
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,900
-You know what subtle means?
-Laid back and shit.

528
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,900
-Good tunes, Pop?
-Yeah.

529
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,300
Thanks for the phones.

530
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,000
I don't know, Bubs. I mean...

531
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,400
if you go rolling over rocks...

532
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,200
then you're gonna get bit by a snake, right?

533
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Got to pay that tax, Johnny.

534
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,200
You got to give a working police his due.

535
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,900
-So, Bee's working for Lamar?
-All of them work for Lamar.

536
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,300
He got that whole corner to hisself.

537
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,600
You saying the stash is across the street
in the low-rises?

538
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,000
In the second court.

539
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,600
They got it up in this one place
that got the boarded-up windows.

540
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,200
How many doors down from the end?

541
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,400
Three.

542
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,500
Yo, Pops.

543
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,900
Anyone got a line on that wild boy
who likes to pop the shotty?

544
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,400
-Omar?
-Yeah, I need Omar.

545
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,400
What do you want with Omar?

546
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,900
Just want a word with him.

547
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,000
Just a word.

548
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,100
You want to get with Omar...

549
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,000
you need to stand out
on one of them corners...

550
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,000
with a big-ass package.

551
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,500
You be talking to that nigger soon enough.

552
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,500
You feel anything?

553
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,100
Let's go.

554
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,600
Come on.

555
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,900
As agreed, the price of cooperation is
an agreement by the state parole officials...

556
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,300
to move Mr. Barksdale's
first parole hearing forward by 12 months...

557
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,500
and to credit him in the file
with cooperation in this matter.

558
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,300
You can't make a case
on just some con's say so.

559
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,000
We need the dope on the table.

560
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,300
Of course you do.

561
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,200
If, before the end of business today,
you effect a search...

562
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:22,100
of Correctional Officer Tilghman's vehicle,
locker, and person...

563
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,800
we are confident
sufficient evidence will be recovered.

564
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,300
"We are confident"?

565
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,400
As far as D.O.C. is concerned,
this is a fair deal...

566
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,200
if it takes the overdoses off our plate.

567
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,600
But if we come up empty on this....

568
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
You won't.

569
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,300
Five will get you ten...

570
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,700
that's the motherfucker
that spiked the packages.

571
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,400
You have proof of this?

572
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,500
Then we make the case
that's there for us to make.

573
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,800
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. New Orleans.

574
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,200
Lieutenant.

575
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,500
-Welcome to the southeast.
-Major, I understand you asked for me.

576
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,900
My son-in-law can't say enough
in your favor.

577
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,200
And, of course, you did him
a good turn last year, right?

578
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,300
-You want to tell me about this target?
-Frank Sobotka.

579
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,700
A union man down at the port.

580
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,800
The motherfucker's showing a lot of money.
My gut says a drug connection.

581
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,100
I can also tell you for a fact
that his people...

582
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,400
will up and steal anything
that isn't nailed down.

583
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,300
-You seen the off-site?
-Not yet.

584
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,700
I told my people to meet up here,
at the district.

585
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,600
Pretty good digs. Come on, I'll show you.

586
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,600
It's from a young woman to her mother...

587
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,200
or at least an older woman.

588
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,500
She mention any names?

589
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,300
There is an Anya here.

590
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,100
And from the way she writes,
I'm guessing it is a child.

591
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,800
It's almost ready, Father. Excuse me.

592
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,100
-So who's she writing to?
-There is no name.

593
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,800
The letter is for the whole family.

594
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,900
But...

595
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,300
she signs, "Nadya." Her name is Nadya.

596
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,900
-Nadya.
-Is she in trouble?

597
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,200
She's dead.

598
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,100
Anything in the letter to indicate
as to where these people live?

599
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,600
If you had an envelope, I could....

600
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,800
The only thing specific she mentions,
is a church...

601
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,400
St. Volodymyr, or St. Vladimir, and a priest.

602
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,800
St. Volodymyr, or St. Vladimir, and a priest.

603
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,200
-Father Vasyl, it says.
-There's no names or places or....

604
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,500
Across the water,
Father Vasyl is a common name...

605
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,500
and there are many St. Volodymyrs.

606
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,200
But leave the letter. I will try.

607
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,900
Thank you.

608
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,200
I'm saying, if there isn't enough work,
then you could do something else, that's all.

609
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,100
There's enough work.

610
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,100
Fact is, I came into
some back pay I was owed...

611
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,000
from about a month ago.

612
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,800
A couple thousand from
the vacation fund.

613
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,500
Stop, Ash.

614
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,100
I was thinking...

615
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,300
maybe this'll be the time
for us to get a place.

616
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,500
You could cover that?

617
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,100
And maybe we don't rent.

618
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,600
Maybe we try and buy something
in the neighborhood.

619
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,400
Nothing too big, just....

620
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,500
I heard Aunt Treesey's
old place up in Covington...

621
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,600
has been fixed up real nice.

622
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,500
Like with wood floors and all.

623
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,000
Ash, what's that ship right there?

624
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,900
-Cable ship.
-And what's the gray one next to it?

625
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,500
Military Sealift.

626
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,800
Attagirl.

627
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,500
You cold?

628
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,700
-Dwight?
-What's up?

629
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,300
We're gonna have to
search your vehicle. Sorry.

630
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,700
Search? What the fuck?

631
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,500
Open it, or I'm gonna shim the lock,
maybe damage your ride.

632
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,700
You got no call to be doing me like this.

633
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,000
-No call and no damn warrant.
-You drive onto a D.O.C. facility...

634
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,200
you acknowledge the vehicle's
subject to search.

635
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,300
Where's the key, Dwight?

636
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
He's gonna be back
from lunch any minute, Zig.

637
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,100
You hear me? He sees you on that thing...

638
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,900
he's gonna break you down
and sell you for parts.

639
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,100
Here it be.

640
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,700
You all planted that shit.

641
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,800
You fucking know you did.

642
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,300
-What's with the whistle squad?
-It's for us.

643
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,900
They marked us the moment
we stepped out of the car.

644
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,200
-That's him.
-That's Horseface?

645
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,800
-How did he get the name?
-You need a close-up?

646
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,800
Thomas Pakusa.

647
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,800
We need to talk to you about something.

648
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,000
What?

649
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,300
You were working the Atlantic Light
when it docked, right?

650
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,600
If you say so.

651
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,800
You remember that container
that came off that day?

652
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,000
-With all the dead girls.
-No.

653
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,500
You don't remember
all them dead girls in a can?

654
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,000
Come on, Horse.

655
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,300
I remember when you found them all
in the stacks.

656
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,900
I don't remember
they came off the Atlantic Light.

657
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,700
Let's take a ride downtown,
clear this mess up.

658
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,800
No.

659
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,700
Get the fuck in the car.

660
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,300
-Am I locked up?
-Get in the damn car.

661
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,500
You want me in that car,
you need to lock me up.

662
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,400
If that's the way it'll be,
I wanna talk to my shop steward...

663
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,000
and he can have an IBS lawyer go with me.

664
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,000
Dad, what--

665
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,700
Jesus, Pop, what's that for?

666
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,700
Say cheese.

667
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,700
You pull another stunt like that, Zig,
I'll have your damn card.

668
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,000
I don't care who your mother is.
Get the fuck out of here!

669
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,500
Kind of smart for a fat man, isn't he?

670
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,000
All right.

671
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,500
Goddamn it, Ziggy, you sick fuck.

672
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,900
Get your dick out of my computer!

673
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,000
Where are the detectives
who were first assigned?

674
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,400
Dead. To me, anyway.

675
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,000
I shipped them humps back to Burrell
as fast as I could.

676
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,800
What kept you?

677
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,600
That's the beautiful thing
about this department.

678
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,500
Every brain-dead
somehow manages to land on his feet.

679
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,500
-How's it hanging, Prez?
-How're you doing?

680
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,800
I'm all right.

681
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,300
Where's Lester? We got him, too, right?

682
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,900
He was out on the street
today with Homicide...

683
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,400
but Rawls promised to give him
the bad news tomorrow.

684
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,600
Not McNulty though.

685
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,300
McNulty they really hate,
not that I blame them.

686
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,400
You, of course,
have Roland for the duration.

687
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,700
Anyone else from the southeastern
you need, you got.

688
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,600
I'll leave you to it, then.

689
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,600
Carver's in the southeast, now.
I think he's got Sector Two.

690
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,200
It'd be great to have Carver on this, right?

691
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,700
On what?

692
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,000
We don't even know what the hell
we're supposed to be chasing here.

693
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,700
No offense to your father-in-law,
but it's real thin.

694
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,400
We're here, right? Whatever happens,
we run with the program for a few weeks.

695
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,600
Maybe make a drug case or two
down by the port.

696
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,900
Beats the hell out of E.C.U. anyway.

697
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,900
Him and this lady have this daughter.
The daughter's born a mute.

698
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,500
The wife doesn't like that at all,
so she breaks out.

699
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,200
So this guy's raising his daughter,
she has her period...

700
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,000
freaks out, goes to him,
he thinks she was raped--

701
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,400
Jackpot.

702
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,500
That's about $10 worth
of bulk metal right there.

703
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,600
We just have to haul it down
to the scrap yard and we're good.

704
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,700
We'll break our fucking backs on this thing.

705
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,200
Keep your eye to the ground, okay?
I'm schooling you.

706
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,500
Okay?

707
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,800
This is good, right here.

708
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,600
This is $10 right here.

709
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,200
Snitching Bubs.

710
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,500
You be asking for me?

711
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,900
These headphones are great.
I'm gonna use them at the gym. Thanks.

712
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,600
-You hear the boys?
-No, it's quiet up there.

713
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,200
A little too quiet.

714
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,800
That means they're probably
playing video games.

715
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,800
Or with a book of matches.

716
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,300
So, did you have a lawyer
look at the papers yet?

717
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,200
I did.

718
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,200
-And?
-He says I shouldn't sign it.

719
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,700
Says I'm giving away too much.

720
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,200
I would never, under any circumstances...

721
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:46,100
pay that kind of support and alimony
if we went to court.

722
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,600
That's what he says?

723
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,100
Signed and notarized.

724
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,300
I don't wanna argue about the money.

725
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,700
I wanna get back together.

726
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,300
Yeah.

727
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,300
Yo, String, I was subtle with that.

728
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,600
...has led to drug distribution charges
against three inmates...

729
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,700
one who was, himself, incapacitated...

730
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,700
by the tainted narcotics
and the correctional officer...

731
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,800
a 10-year veteran.

732
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,400
I've been instructed
by the Corrections Commissioner...

733
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,800
and the State Public Safety Secretary...

734
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,100
to announce that the maximum penalties...

735
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,700
will be sought against this officer....

736
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,200
I got a midterm. I got to study.

737
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,000
-So this is their joint?
-What's the plan?

738
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:25,300
Time to make it clear to these people
that we're not gonna go away.

739
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,800
You ain't gonna play
that country shit, right?

740
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,100
I hate that country shit.

741
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,400
Not even Ray Charles
can save that mess for me.

742
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,000
No, sir.

743
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,700
Big Daddy Lipscomb was right tackle.
Your brain's gone to shit, Jessy.

744
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,700
Left tackle.

745
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,300
You was too busy pissing in your drawers
to learn left from right.

746
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,800
Take your ass down to Schula's Steakhouse
and get an education.

747
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,100
Darling.

748
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,800
What's the deal?

749
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,600
Just dropping in for one or two
and then we take ourselves out of here.

750
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,700
How about you?

751
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,800
I'm leaving after this one.

752
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,300
You guys Port Police?
I don't recognize either one of you.

753
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,400
-City Homicide.
-Homicide?

754
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,400
-Who got killed?
-Those dead girls in the can.

755
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,700
That was an accident.
That was a fucking accident.

756
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,100
That's what I heard, anyway.

757
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,200
Excuse me.

758
00:56:17,305 --> 00:57:17,754

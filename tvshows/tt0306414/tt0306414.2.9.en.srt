2
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,700
WMD. Got that WMD here.

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,700
I'm looking for what you had the other day.

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,000
-This shit right here?
-The other day you was calling it bin Laden.

5
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,700
But now it's WMD.
It will mass destruct your ass.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,600
So this the hi-test?

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,600
Same shit, new name.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,600
You be all right.

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,300
Okay, get dressed.

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,000
I pressed you some clothes
and laid them out upstairs.

11
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,200
And don't forget that book bag neither.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,700
You got your chrome, young one?

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,500
I'll take mine.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Y'all mind the crossfire, you hear?

15
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,200
Let's go.

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
They coming up the alley!

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,400
They coming back!

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,100
Aim for the chest, brother, you hear me?

19
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,600
Slide up.

20
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,800
You get down on that floor and stay there,
you hear?

21
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,000
-You hear me, boy?
-Okay, Mama.

22
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,100
Come on!

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Fuck!

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,100
Shit!

25
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,900
-Why you running?
-What the fuck?

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,100
Oh, shit!

27
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,600
Hit that nigger cold.

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,600
Bitches!

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,800
Why you hiding?

30
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,900
Drama done with, boy.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,300
You gotta get your bags
and get yourself to school.

32
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,300
Get in, damn it!

33
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,800
T.T., you hear me?
Come on now. The drama's done.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Get your bags and get yourself to school.

35
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,400
I told you, you gotta get ready....

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
No!

37
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,100
They're changing up?

38
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,600
Looking for my La-Z-Boys.
Five of them you got for me, right?

39
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,100
-That shipment is tomorrow.
-Got it.

40
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,200
That's what the Newkirk warehouse
was giving us a few days back.

41
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,500
Straight, to-the-point drug talk.
No muss, no fuss.

42
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,300
Now listen.

43
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,200
Pyramid, lnc. May I help you?

44
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,900
-You got them Davinas or what?
-I'm told we no longer carry that line, sir.

45
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,700
Between me, Kima, Herc and Carver...

46
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,000
we been sitting on that warehouse
every minute...

47
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,900
since we followed that truck off the docks.

48
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,100
No players coming in or going out.
No drug-related traffic at all.

49
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,700
To top it off,
Sobotka hasn't used his cell phone since.

50
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,400
-We tipped our hand somewhere.
-That second can, maybe.

51
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,000
The port police making a traffic stop
on their cargo must've spooked them.

52
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,900
If that's what did it,
we fucked ourselves over nothing.

53
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,600
They dumped that can as a misdelivery.

54
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,600
-What?
-They probably changed that up, too.

55
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,300
If they think we're onto them...

56
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,700
they switch the can themselves,
just to be safe.

57
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,300
And it goes off the docks
with some bullshit inside...

58
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,900
-just to see if we pull them up.
-Which we did.

59
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,700
Which I did.

60
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,200
No, they're not on us completely.

61
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,800
If they were, they'd be shutting
that warehouse down and rolling out.

62
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,300
Instead, they're just sitting inside that place,
turning away calls...

63
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
waiting us out.

64
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,400
I, for one, am a patient motherfucker.

65
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,200
Don't waste film.

66
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,500
I been here so fucking long
that you're starting to look good to me.

67
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,600
Anything?

68
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,900
The drugs go in, they gotta come out, right?
I mean, what the fuck?

69
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,000
Little late.

70
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
When a 9-year-old kid hit the pavement...

71
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,500
a district commander would be there
within minutes.

72
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,800
I guess we're living in a brave new world.

73
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,100
I was in Washington with Burrell
when I heard.

74
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,900
D.C.? What for?

75
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,100
Burrell took some district commanders
down to DOJ with him...

76
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,100
pimping ourselves for a little grant money.

77
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,900
So what do we got?

78
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,900
Nine-year-old in his bedroom...

79
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
catches a seeing-eye stray
through the window.

80
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,400
-Dead?
-Pronounced at University.

81
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,800
-Witnesses?
-No one offering a name...

82
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,800
but the general theme
is two crews arguing over the real estate.

83
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,600
We got casings from at least
three different calibers on the ground.

84
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,200
We're gonna canvass hard,
but your people and Tactical...

85
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,000
should hit the area drug corners
and collect bodies.

86
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,800
Fucking pointless.

87
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,600
We jack up enough shitbirds,
this case can fall.

88
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,600
I ain't talking about that. I know the drill.
I'm talking about this whole mess.

89
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,000
Been chasing this shit
from one corner to the next like it's a plan.

90
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,800
Hit the corners, Howard. Take scalps.

91
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,400
You'll feel better when you do.

92
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,200
You told us about WorldCom
and the name change-up, right?

93
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,300
-You said that--
-I said change the name of our product.

94
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,900
I didn't say nothing
about taking people off a corner.

95
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,700
We done changed the name
of that weak shit so many times...

96
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,100
that don't nobody come down
to the Towers no more.

97
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,000
And them Carrollton boys had it going on.

98
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,400
Who shot the young one?

99
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
I don't know. I don't think it was us.

100
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,800
Them other niggers was going wild, though,
I mean--

101
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,700
You know, the cops are gonna have to
bang some heads on this one.

102
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,200
They got to.

103
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,200
That means we gotta shut everything down
until this shit pass.

104
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,300
That means the Towers, the low-rises.

105
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,300
Everything gotta take
a long fucking time-out!

106
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,100
I know, String.

107
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,100
I'm sorry, man.

108
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,500
Let me tell you something, man.

109
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,000
This here game,
it's more than the rep you carry...

110
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,300
the corner you hold.

111
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,500
You gotta be fierce, I know that.

112
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,200
But more than that,
you gotta show some flex.

113
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,400
Give and take on both sides.

114
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,400
-You hear me?
-Yeah.

115
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,200
All right, anything that fired a bullet
out on that corner...

116
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,000
has gotta disappear, you understand me?

117
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,900
I'm not talking about the storm drains.

118
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,900
Call that nigger Shamrock
and drive all that chrome over to the harbor.

119
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,600
All right.

120
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,000
Coming up.

121
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,700
I got people waiting on a package from me...

122
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,500
but Sergei says
that until we're sure about the police....

123
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,800
We're not going to be doing that business
for a few days.

124
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,300
Your uncle, he is right to be careful.

125
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,800
But, Niko...

126
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,800
if you are going to be doing this,
you should not be talking to us about it.

127
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,000
Why not?

128
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,700
We are more, what you call, wholesalers.

129
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,900
I'm kind of small-time, huh?

130
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,900
You are not so big,
but you're among friends.

131
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,400
Call that number.

132
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
-Talk to him.
-Mike?

133
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,800
This White Mike?

134
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,200
-You know him?
-From Curtis Bay.

135
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,300
I went to Southern High School
with the guy.

136
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,400
You are with us now,
so he will be fair. No problem.

137
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,600
Now, for the rest of our business....

138
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,000
We will disappear these containers.
All of them clean.

139
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,400
Take them to Newkirk Street.

140
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,800
If there is a problem,
they will stop the trucks...

141
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,700
or we will see the police.

142
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,300
If not, no more worries.

143
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,700
All right.

144
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,900
We are off the warehouse phone now?

145
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,800
All day yesterday,
I was giving the new number to our people.

146
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,500
This is bullshit.

147
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,300
If they were onto the truck,
then they would've searched it, no?

148
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,000
Five-O!

149
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,400
Where you guys going?
Come on, you know the deal.

150
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,200
Get the fuck up against the wall! Hurry up!

151
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,400
Come on, keep moving.

152
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,700
Get him. Down.

153
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,600
This is bullshit, man.
You know I ain't did nothing, man.

154
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,900
Everybody gets the special
downtown at central booking:

155
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,800
one baloney sandwich and one white milk.

156
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,300
-Just shut the fuck up.
-Man, I'm clean, you hear me?

157
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,300
-What are you doing in the Pit then?
-Saying no to drugs.

158
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,300
Don't just say no to drugs, motherfucker.
Say, "No, thank you."

159
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,800
Put your fucking head down,
step up and get in.

160
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
Sit down right here, stupid.
Watch your head going in.

161
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,900
Slide over, asshole.

162
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Shame a kid had to get killed
before we got around to doing this.

163
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,200
What exactly is it that we're doing?

164
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,700
Young boy killed over bullshit.

165
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,300
Now you got the police
crawling all the way up your ass.

166
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,400
It's a good day to be an Eastside nigger,
I gotta say.

167
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,100
Thing is, it ain't gonna happen like that
if I take you up on your offer.

168
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,600
I'll be out there selling that real.

169
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,600
My boys ain't gonna be scuffling.

170
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,300
They ain't gonna be scuffling or standing
on nobody's else's corner, starting no shit.

171
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,500
You're Westside.

172
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,700
You must've heard of Charlie Sollers, right?

173
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,100
No.

174
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,800
Goes all the way back
to Franklin and Fremont.

175
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,700
I mean, all the way back to the '60s and shit.

176
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,900
-Sollers?
-Sold heroin like it was water.

177
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,800
I mean,
the motherfucker made himself some money.

178
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,800
I don't know who the fuck you talking about.

179
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,900
I know you don't.

180
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,200
And the police don't.

181
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,100
And the stick-up boys
wouldn't have a fucking clue either.

182
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,800
'Cause Charlie Sollers just sold dope.

183
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,200
No profile, no street rep.
Just buy for $1, sell for $2.

184
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,900
Sometimes, when your back up
against the wall, you go to the gun.

185
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,900
I know. I been there.

186
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,100
But you ain't gotta live by it.

187
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,600
Avon's a soldier.

188
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,400
That's who you want with you
when the shit fly.

189
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,700
But as far as business go....

190
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,200
-You still got that connect?
-Right off the boat, String.

191
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,900
All right.

192
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,600
I'm gonna buy from you
at the price you paying...

193
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,700
and I'll let you walk that shit
straight in the Towers.

194
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,500
You can have 734, 770 and 221 .

195
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,000
I keep the other three.

196
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,900
How you gonna tell it to Avon?

197
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,100
It makes sense, don't it?

198
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,500
He gonna hear something
when it makes sense.

199
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,500
Right?

200
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,100
No shit.

201
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,400
-I thought you was in with Nicky.
-Fuck Nick.

202
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,700
He said you was his other half.

203
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,600
I don't want his fucking money.
I mean, that's drug money.

204
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,300
And fucking drugs are bad, right?

205
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,400
I mean, you gotta consider
what that shit does to the community.

206
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,200
You spent all last year with White Mike.
You remember that?

207
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,600
A man can grow.

208
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,900
Besides, I got a caper in mind
that is gonna put that horseshit to shame.

209
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,400
I'm telling you.

210
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,400
You want in?

211
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,200
-What do I gotta do?
-What a longshoreman does best, Johnny.

212
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,600
Zig, your duck won't touch
the Pikesville rye?

213
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,900
He drinks mid-shelf.
He don't like that rail shit.

214
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,400
Fuck if I wouldn't give my right leg
for a shot and a beer.

215
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,700
New Charles in the house.

216
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,700
-Moving pretty good.
-Waiting on a prosthetic.

217
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,900
You got a decent lawyer?

218
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,800
Nat Coxson hooked me up
through the union.

219
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,200
What's with the duck?

220
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,300
-You know you gotta let go of your name.
-Say what?

221
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,800
Yeah, New Charles don't work no more
for a one-legged fuck.

222
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,600
Yeah, maybe "Stump."

223
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,800
You know what? "Peg."

224
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,100
"New Peggy."

225
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,800
-How about "Tilt"?
-Tilt?

226
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,800
Tilt. Just like a pinball machine.

227
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,300
Tilt. I like that.

228
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,900
Yeah, I called a couple of nights ago.

229
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Told you I might be in town tonight,
remember?

230
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,400
-So, this is your first time?
-Yep, first time for me.

231
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,400
What do you do, Jimmy?
Are you the police?

232
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,200
-Do you work with the police?
-No. Christ, no.

233
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,900
No, I'm a traveling salesman.
I travel and, you know....

234
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,300
-Where do you live?
-I'm not gonna tell you that.

235
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,600
I live out of town.

236
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm sorry.
I don't think we can help you tonight.

237
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,200
Thank you.

238
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,300
You sucked. I mean, really.

239
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Fuck if I thought
I was gonna be interrogated.

240
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,200
I mean, Christ,
I'm just a guy looking to get laid, right?

241
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,300
Hey, fucknuts.

242
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,100
What the fuck is wrong with you?

243
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,800
Christ, Ziggy.

244
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Jesus, Zig. What the fuck?

245
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,100
What's up with my cousin?

246
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,000
Don't even talk to me about that asshole.

247
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,100
-Drank himself to death.
-Oh, shit.

248
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,500
What kind of fool
would give a duck whiskey anyhow?

249
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,400
That boy ain't right.

250
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,300
And his fucking bird
couldn't hold liquor for shit.

251
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,600
La-Z-Boys?

252
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,700
And Davinas. Male and female.

253
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,500
Dope and coke.

254
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
-What the hell is a Davina?
-It's like a love seat, kind of.

255
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,400
-Any line on weight?
-All whole numbers.

256
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,800
-No halves, quarters, eight-balls?
-Ounces?

257
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What kind of numbers
they putting on the furniture?

258
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,000
Nothing much above five.

259
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,400
Proposition Joe has Ashland
all the way up to North.

260
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,300
Ten corners, easy.
Five ounces wouldn't last him past lunch.

261
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,300
It's kilos. We're on the main stem.

262
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,000
It's kilos. We're on the main stem.

263
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,300
-What was coming and going last night?
-Not much.

264
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,800
No trucks in, some cars in and out...

265
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,600
but none of the drug players
we saw rolling up there before.

266
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,900
Whatever was in that last truckload
probably went out in car trunks.

267
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,300
They're doing their distribution
somewhere else for now.

268
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,700
Which is why job one
is to get back to a good phone.

269
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,000
The same PC
that got you on that warehouse phone...

270
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,200
will get you anywhere else you want to go.

271
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,500
All we need is the new number.

272
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Verizon running
any new lines in there lately?

273
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,000
We talked to the phone security people.
They say no.

274
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,500
Probably going to a cell phone.

275
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Best bet is to get the new number
off the Russian's cell phone.

276
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,100
Okay, then.

277
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,400
Freamon and Prez,
stay on one shift in the wiretap room.

278
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,600
Bunk and Russell, man the other.

279
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,000
Herc and Carver,
you guys are on Newkirk Street...

280
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,600
waiting to see
if the warehouse traffic picks back up.

281
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,400
McNulty and Greggs
have a line into the prostitution ring.

282
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
But so far, the people handling the girls...

283
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
have been a little cautious
about fresh johns.

284
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,100
So we're gonna need a new angle there.

285
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,500
Questions?

286
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,100
What was your play with those girls?

287
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,400
Out-of-town salesman.

288
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,600
-How far out of town?
-What do you mean?

289
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,700
The farther out of town,
the more they believe.

290
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,400
Less like a cop you sound.

291
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,700
You do any accents?

292
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,900
English, British, Scottish,
something like that?

293
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,200
Crikey!

294
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,000
I was looking to get a little hanky-panky...

295
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,600
and this one bloke gave me this number
to call when I got across the pond.

296
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,200
Work on it, son.

297
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,400
$200,000?

298
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,400
That isn't a quarter of what they owe.

299
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,500
They say they will pay another $200,000
once their shipment clears the docks.

300
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,900
-And then?
-That is all.

301
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,400
These Colombians
are without honor, Spiros.

302
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,100
They are cheats.

303
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,400
-The chemicals we sent are good, no?
-No complaint.

304
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,600
They say they want more, even.

305
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,600
And they understand that we can guarantee
their product gonna clear Customs?

306
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,100
Right.

307
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
-And still, they try to chisel.
-Why?

308
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,700
What are they thinking?

309
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,600
That it is all profit for us.

310
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,800
That we will settle
for half of what we agreed...

311
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,700
because $400,000 is still a lot of money.

312
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,800
The Greek will be angry.

313
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,100
This is business, Eton.

314
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,400
The Greek? He will be smart.

315
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,400
Jesus.

316
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,400
You accidentally shoot one 9-year-old
in his bedroom...

317
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
and the whole city gets its undies
in a bunch.

318
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,400
To err is human, that's what I like to say.

319
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,800
The mayor went to the scene
for the cameras last night.

320
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,200
Said the crime will not stand.

321
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,100
Tell the mayor we're still working
without an eyeball witness.

322
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,500
How about the street talk?

323
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,500
I got some mentions of a 17-year-old
with the streetname Bodie.

324
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,800
Narcotics has him as Preston Broadus.

325
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,800
And why is young Preston
not being hurled with great abandon...

326
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,800
around one of our interrogation rooms?

327
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,700
We got cars on his grandma's as we speak.

328
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,600
What the fuck you think
you're dealing with here? Amateurs?

329
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,600
Fuck Nick. This is my thing.

330
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,700
You want in, you gotta deal with me.

331
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,000
All right, I got S-Class and SL-Class Benzes.

332
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,600
Roadsters, sedans, cabriolets.

333
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,000
I got them brand new,
with the keys in the ignition.

334
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,200
Nothing stripped.

335
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,600
-Off the docks?
-No shit, off the docks.

336
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,500
What the fuck do I look like,
a fucking car dealer?

337
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,800
Twenty on the dollar.

338
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,200
But if we're gonna do this, I'm gonna
need you to order a minimum of three.

339
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,800
Or else it ain't worth it for me.

340
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,900
Now, base price on an S430
starts at $73,000.

341
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,300
You round it,
I get $15,000 for each car that you want.

342
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,400
A stolen car is a stolen car.

343
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,200
Without title,
who is going to pay even $10,000 for it?

344
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,400
Sure, in Baltimore, maybe.
But where you're from...

345
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,200
I'll bet you got family
that don't give two fucks...

346
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,000
whether or not an American car
got a title on it.

347
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,700
Man, it would be a sad state of affairs...

348
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,100
if an international entrepreneur
such as yourself...

349
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,500
didn't know what to do
with a couple of extra Mercedes.

350
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,900
Big night for Jimmy McNulty.

351
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,900
Or should I say
James Cromwell of Knightsbridge...

352
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,100
Stepney and Mersey.

353
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,400
Excuse me?

354
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,600
Cromwell was the English fuck
who stole my ancestors' land...

355
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,700
and the other ones
are all from rock 'n' roll songs.

356
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,500
Anyways, 10:00 tomorrow night...

357
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,500
the shuttle comes for me
on the parking lot off Russell Street.

358
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,900
Good work.

359
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,800
We'll get Greggs to wire you up
and set the surveillance.

360
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,300
Shame we're not up
on a good phone right now.

361
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,100
Be nice to tickle the wire
when we raid the brothel.

362
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,300
A little luck,
maybe we get back up before then.

363
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,800
One other thing.

364
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,600
I'm bothered that a Russian immigrant
this deep in dirt...

365
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,500
doesn't have anything
in a law enforcement computer.

366
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,500
You still got that friend over in Woodlawn?

367
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,000
I'd like to know what the FBI has
in its database.

368
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,000
After that meeting on the Barksdale case...

369
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,600
I made a point of pissing him off,
remember?

370
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,700
So what? You do that to everybody.

371
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,700
This is George Glekas.

372
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,100
He's the cat who owns the appliance store
where that second can landed.

373
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,400
Run his ass, too.

374
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,100
Why not just cut another guy in
and run them out the bobtail lane?

375
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,200
These babies start disappearing
and everybody on the terminal...

376
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,300
is gonna suspect an inside job.

377
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,400
We're gonna need bolt cutters
for the fence...

378
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
and then we're gonna need
enough wood beams...

379
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,500
to make a track across the grass
onto the road.

380
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Why bother?

381
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,700
We can run them cars
over that little patch of grass, no problem.

382
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,600
That ain't the plan.

383
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,700
I just saw a can disappear.

384
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,200
-Talco line?
-Pakusa working it?

385
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,200
-It's him. Do we try to follow?
-We know where it's going, right?

386
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,900
1 2-08, you copy?

387
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,100
1 2-08, what's up?

388
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,500
We got a can that might be coming to you
off the port.

389
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,900
Can number: Paul-Mike-Quebec-Victor...

390
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,100
4-0-0-7-6-5, check digit two.

391
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,100
-What do you want us to do with it?
-See if it arrives.

392
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,800
And if it does?

393
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,900
See what happens then.

394
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,100
You wanna know something, Carv?

395
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,900
I'm starting to think
that as criminal investigators...

396
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
we're not really respected.

397
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,600
That ain't necessary, Jimmy.

398
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,100
I knew we were fucking the dog
on that Barksdale thing.

399
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,700
Who do I tell?

400
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,800
We got this new ASAC,
thinks it's all about loyalty and ass-kiss.

401
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,800
And believe me, this ain't like your agency.

402
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,600
You piss them off, you ride the boat.

403
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,700
Here...

404
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,200
you come into work one morning,
you find yourself assigned...

405
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,100
to some fucking dustbowl
lndian res in Arkansas.

406
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,300
-Still, I was out of line, Fitz.
-Fuck it.

407
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,500
What you got there, brother?

408
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,800
White boys. A different look for you.

409
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,700
Funny thing is, they're all showing clean.
What's the chance of that?

410
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,100
Anyways, NCIC and NADDIS are a dead end.

411
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Customs had a little intel
on this guy, Glekas.

412
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,700
You said Customs had intel on him?

413
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,100
Should show here.
Let me try something else with it.

414
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,200
This'll give us any contact your boy
might have had with us, agency-wide.

415
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,500
Got something out of San Diego.

416
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,500
-On Glekas?
-We'll see.

417
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,100
I make a long distance call to Hyattsville...

418
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
I need three forms
and a lieutenant's approval.

419
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,600
Yes, Agent Ernest Koutris, please.

420
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,900
Believe me,
we ain't short on paperwork here either.

421
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,800
Agent Koutris?

422
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,600
Not much to it.

423
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,900
We pulled his chain in a stolen goods case
I worked in '95, '96.

424
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,300
He was just crumbs, so no charges.
But I did an interview.

425
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,700
The guy struck me
as just a mope playing it slick.

426
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,500
Yeah, if you want, I can send you what I got.

427
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,800
All right.

428
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,400
If you need it, let me know.

429
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,900
We need to talk.

430
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,400
Anyone following?

431
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,100
Run up and down the street.
Take tag numbers from cars.

432
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,600
-All week I've done it. Nothing.
-Again.

433
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,600
The truck is here.

434
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,600
Lester, it's here.

435
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,900
They offload anything?

436
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,300
Not yet.

437
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,100
Okay, wait on it.

438
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,100
See, the thing about it, Preston,
is that you're unbelievably stupid.

439
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,400
You are.

440
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,700
I don't say it to upset you.
Just to state a fact.

441
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,700
He doesn't think so.

442
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,400
Nobody ever thinks they're stupid.
It's part of the stupidity.

443
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,900
You don't need to tell us
what happened on that corner.

444
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,400
We know what happened.

445
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,300
We got you, we got your guns,
we got the whole fucking story.

446
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
Where that lawyer at, man?

447
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,100
See, you just fucked up.

448
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,100
Way you looked at the bag,
you know what's in there, don't you?

449
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,800
That's you, right there, fucking up.

450
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,500
-I don't know what you talking about.
-No, you fucked up.

451
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,500
We even got your prints on one of the guns.
We even got that.

452
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,900
Which one?

453
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,500
That's you right there.

454
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,800
Lawyer.

455
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,900
They were asking about me?

456
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,100
San Diego.

457
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,800
San Diego was a long time ago.

458
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,500
Our friend in Washington
does not know why.

459
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,700
Only that the people asked.

460
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,000
You told me the police
looking into the women were local.

461
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,400
They were.

462
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,900
No FBl.

463
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,700
We've been running only clean containers?

464
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,500
Yes. And no one watches, no one follows.

465
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,600
No one stops anything.

466
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,500
And we changed the warehouse phone?

467
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,600
A day or two more,
and we are back to business.

468
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,200
We watch, we are careful.
But we are back to business.

469
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,600
You will have to do a favor
for our friend, no?

470
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,200
Fair is fair.

471
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,500
The Colombians, I think.

472
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,000
They take our chemicals
and pay less than promised.

473
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,400
Down there,
I understand everyone is a terrorist now.

474
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,100
Judges are killed.
Bombs go off in the street. It's very bad.

475
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,100
The Colombians who cheated us,
they're not with the guerrillas.

476
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,600
They're trash.

477
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,500
The world is a smaller place now.

478
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:32,100
And the FBI cares very much
about such things.

479
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,200
Fair is fair.

480
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,300
Sergei's making a call.

481
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,300
If there is no problem,
then bring in the La-Z-Boys.

482
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,200
I will meet you there.

483
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,800
Recognize that voice?

484
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,000
That's the man
from the warehouse phone, right?

485
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,900
-That's the same guy?
-Same guy, new number.

486
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,400
-Who you calling?
-Pearlman, at home.

487
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,500
Another affidavit,
and we're back on the main stem.

488
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,600
Shit is raw, String.

489
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,500
I mean, you can stomp on this motherfucker.

490
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,100
All right.

491
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,300
So, when them police stop
busting heads up in them Towers...

492
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,900
you all let Prop Joe's people
take hold of three of them.

493
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,200
All right.

494
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,000
Okay, add the DNR stuff to the boilerplate,
and you're there.

495
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,600
Start connecting the dots...

496
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,900
and you have to start asking yourself
what these guys aren't into.

497
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,800
Drugs, women, stolen goods. All of them.

498
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,500
FBI didn't have much.

499
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,700
A little something out of San Diego
on Glekas...

500
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,900
-in a stolen goods case that was closed out.
-San Diego?

501
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,300
These guys move around.

502
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,600
-What's with the suit?
-Date night.

503
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,200
The undercover at the brothel.

504
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,100
Run like hell, ma'am.

505
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,700
We wanna be up on that phone,
so we hear what we hear after tonight's raid.

506
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,500
Who's the affiant?

507
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,500
Can you get the SL-series in Pacific blue?
That would be best.

508
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,600
Whatever you need, chief.

509
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,800
I don't give a damn
about the color of this one.

510
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,200
Whatever you have.

511
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,500
Ain't a problem.
They all just gotta have sunroofs.

512
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,800
It's a long story.

513
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,800
Next Tuesday would be good for us.
A ship comes Wednesday early, so....

514
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,800
Listen...

515
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,600
you think I can get an advance on this?

516
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,100
I got some expenses right now,
and I'm a little tapped.

517
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,700
-I'm just asking.
-Payment on delivery.

518
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,400
Don't worry about it, chief.

519
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,200
I would never even dream of cheating
a smart businessman like yourself.

520
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,900
It ain't enough that I gotta be the one
thinking this whole shit through.

521
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
That I gotta be the one
looking out for this shit and that shit.

522
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,900
Checking up on this,
making sure this shit is done.

523
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,900
No, that's not enough.

524
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,300
That's why they be paying
them fucking CEOs so much damn money.

525
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,100
Because when the shit fall bad,
it all fall bad on them.

526
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Everybody else can be ducking and hiding,
doing what they fucking wanna do.

527
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,500
But when push come to shove...

528
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,900
I'm the one
who's got to take that responsibility...

529
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and y'all are leaving me
very little to work with right now.

530
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,900
-Hold up, String--
-No, that's a very simple thing, my nigger.

531
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,400
You drive the guns to the water.

532
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,900
You look around, you ain't see anybody,
you throw the guns.

533
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,100
In the water.

534
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,600
Splash.

535
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,800
Now, get the fuck out of here, man.

536
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,300
Except you, young one.

537
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,400
You ain't say shit back there?

538
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,300
No, they fucked up when they told me
my prints was on one of them guns, right?

539
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,500
And I wiped them shits down myself.

540
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,100
And the one they said was mine
wasn't even.

541
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,400
If they would've had anything past my name,
they would've kept me, right?

542
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
-All right.
-All right, String.

543
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,000
Lock that door.

544
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,900
You got a bolt cutter?
'Cause I'm gonna need a good one.

545
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,400
Got two in the window there.

546
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,100
Got two in the window there.

547
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,900
You hung this on a duck?

548
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,200
Of course.

549
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,000
$1,200.

550
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,100
Fair enough.

551
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,000
-Nick.
-It's been a while, Mikey.

552
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,700
Yeah, it has.

553
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,600
But your name
has been ringing out in my mind lately.

554
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,800
Yeah?

555
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,100
My man called.

556
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,100
Said you was gonna take a re-up from me.

557
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,400
Yeah, that's what they told me, too.

558
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,400
Nicky Sobotka, living the life.

559
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,500
Who fucking knew?

560
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,400
-So how much you looking for?
-Two or three G-packs a week.

561
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,000
I was getting that shit
from the Greek's people.

562
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,600
-Four each.
-Four?

563
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,900
I wholesale for five, man.

564
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,600
I don't know.

565
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,800
They told me
you were gonna be straight with it.

566
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,700
Sergei. What up, dawg?

567
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,100
I got a friend of yours here
says we're giving Gs at four.

568
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,200
Yeah?

569
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,000
All right, fuck it. Yeah, it's fine.

570
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,100
Another thing.

571
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,100
I wanna know it wasn't your people...

572
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,500
dropped that body over on Potee Street
the other night, you know?

573
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,700
I'm asking 'cause it was someone
with some Greek-ass name...

574
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,600
and fuck if he wasn't dumped
in front of a house I was using.

575
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,000
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

576
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,000
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

577
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,800
Idiot.

578
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,500
You got friends in high places, Nicky.

579
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,400
-Four a pack for you.
-All right, cool.

580
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,400
Thank God for the Russian's cell phone.

581
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,600
They might be laying off the warehouse line,
but at least he ain't changing that up.

582
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,200
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

583
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,200
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

584
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,000
-What the fuck is that?
-It's a man's purse.

585
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,800
European men like yourself
sometimes carry one.

586
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,600
Them people ain't right over there.

587
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,100
The mike has to go somewhere.

588
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,400
Besides, you might have hands all over you
before we get what we need.

589
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,100
Indeed I might, luv.

590
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,000
It'll be your call
when we come through the doors.

591
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,700
You want us in, you say.... What was it?

592
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,300
"Spot on." It means "exactly."

593
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,200
And remember, they have to bring up
the money and the sex first...

594
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,800
then an overt attempt to engage.

595
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,300
Spot on.

596
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,400
Detective Freamon with Baltimore Homicide.

597
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,000
Listen, what do you guys have
in VICAP for male victims...

598
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,700
headless or faceless,
and missing both hands?

599
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,800
Middle Atlantic region probably.

600
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,300
$4.5 million in the capital budget
that's set to pass House and Senate both.

601
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Money'll be allocated
for the fiscal period next year.

602
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,500
Congratulations, Frank.

603
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,600
What kind of stevedore drinks champagne?

604
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,800
So, Nat, about the election.

605
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,700
I just need one more year
to bring the dredging home.

606
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,500
That's what I need.

607
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,500
Ott's turn, Frank.

608
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,100
This is Agent Koutris
of the FBI down in Washington.

609
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,400
He's with the counterterrorism people
down there.

610
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,300
-Terrorism?
-He needs our help tonight.

611
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,400
1 1-34, what's your 20?

612
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,700
I'm at the overpass on Wicomico.

613
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,800
Copy that.

614
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,300
Okay, we're on here.

615
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,200
Good evening.

616
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,000
Paint pigments.

617
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,500
They ship them in
for the SCL plant down at Fairfield.

618
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
It's in there somewhere.

619
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,400
Run it.

620
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,700
Same consistencies on all the barrels.

621
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,100
-Nothing else in there, really.
-Nothing but the pigments.

622
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,100
-Nothing else in there, really.
-Nothing but the pigments.

623
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,200
-What's going on?
-I don't know nothing, Horse.

624
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,500
Swear to God.

625
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,900
Tonight, I'm just a dumb white boy
from Locust Point.

626
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,600
You know,
I'm saying this out of respect, Brie.

627
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,300
I love the man like my brother,
but when it comes to something like this...

628
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,300
he gonna listen to you
more than he listen to me.

629
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,800
You think so?

630
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,000
All I put in his ear about my son
didn't do a damn thing, now, did it?

631
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,400
All them times I told him
that he needed to do more for D'Angelo...

632
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,100
and what happened?

633
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,900
He feel for that.

634
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,600
He feel for you.

635
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,900
I know he didn't see it coming.

636
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,900
-None of us seen it coming.
-I did.

637
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,800
I swear, I saw it.

638
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,900
He ain't listen to me then.
Why the hell you think he gonna listen now?

639
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,900
'Cause we got a weak product...

640
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
and we holding on to prime real estate
with no muscle.

641
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,500
I don't got Wee-Bey, Stinkum, Bird.

642
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,600
Now look, I know that your heart is heavy.

643
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,900
I know.

644
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,800
But them wolves is at that door.

645
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,700
As long as them Towers are still standing,
I am, too.

646
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,200
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let
everything we fought for go to shit.

647
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,500
So I'll talk to him.

648
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,800
Mr. Cromwell.

649
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,900
Decisions, decisions.

650
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,100
Would it be wrong to take two?

651
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,200
Attaboy.

652
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,200
We should get upstairs.

653
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,400
Nothing but paint pigments.

654
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,900
Trust me, old friend. It's there.

655
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,900
Son of a bitch!

656
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,300
Okay, then.

657
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,800
Right.

658
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,600
Maybe, we could talk about this first?

659
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,100
Any time you guys want.

660
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,200
The money changed hands, right?

661
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,900
Sounded that way.

662
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,100
-And they talked about sex?
-Definitely.

663
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,000
Any time you guys want.

664
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,300
Hang on.

665
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,200
Oh, God.

666
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,400
Is it soup yet?

667
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,500
Spot something. Spot on it.

668
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,700
Let's go.

669
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,000
-Whoa.
-Why?

670
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,300
We're supposed to take the door
and get in quick.

671
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,500
Calm the fuck down.

672
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,900
It ain't like they gonna flush
a half dozen whores down the toilet.

673
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,000
-Who is it?
-Baltimore police.

674
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,600
-What do you want?
-To lock your ass up.

675
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,900
Hands. Let me see them.

676
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,400
-Two more in the back.
-Come on, ladies.

677
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,400
You're late.

678
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,400
He okay?

679
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,000
He'll live.

680
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,400
...estimated at 1, 125 kilograms
ofprocessed crack cocaine...

681
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,800
is estimated to be in excess of $45 million.

682
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,600
Federal officials have confirmed
to Channel 6 News...

683
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,500
that their investigation is ongoing...

684
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,600
and that while no arrests
have yet been made...

685
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,200
the seizure itself has severely disrupted
the operations of a group...

686
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,300
believed to have ties
to Colombian narco-terrorist--

687
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,700
Now, that, gentlemen, is a case.

688
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,600
God forbid you two should put something
like that on my friend, Frank Sobotka...

689
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,800
I would die happy.

690
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,200
Our case is progressing.

691
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,100
-Great, what can you charge?
-We're not at that point.

692
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,100
We've got wires into a smuggling operation
that we've linked to drugs and women.

693
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,900
Likely, they're the people
who were bringing in the girls...

694
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,100
who turned up dead in that can
two months ago.

695
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,200
Now, we're on one location that we believe
is a transshipment point for narcotics.

696
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,500
And last night, if you check the 24s...

697
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,100
you'll see that we hit a brothel
we also think ties in.

698
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,100
A month or two more
on the taps and DNRs...

699
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,700
and we will be able to identify
the top-end players.

700
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,600
-You hit a brothel?
-Waterfront condo, high-end.

701
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,400
Jesus.

702
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,300
If you find anything that looks
like a list of steady customers, flush it.

703
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,000
I mean, half the names
in the Maryland Manual are probably on it.

704
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,400
Any problems on the raid?

705
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,100
A complication or two.
Nothing we can't write around.

706
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,000
Immigration is holding the girls.

707
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,600
And the madam, who has legal residency,
we cut loose after she posted bail.

708
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,800
You try to interview them?
See if any will roll?

709
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,100
Not while the taps are up.

710
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,700
Better to let them think it was a random raid
and see what's said on the wire today.

711
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,300
Better to let them think it was a random raid
and see what's said on the wire today.

712
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,100
Cut to the chase.
You any closer on my murders?

713
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,700
If these are the people
who were importing those girls...

714
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,300
then, yeah, we're closer.

715
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,900
The more we learn, the more chance
we have to clear those cases.

716
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,100
What about Frank Sobotka?

717
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,900
I'm not hearing his name in here anywhere.

718
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,900
The union may be involved
in the smuggling...

719
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
but we're not getting a sense
that it goes past that.

720
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,400
This is about Frank Sobotka.

721
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,700
The case is bigger now.

722
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:32,800
Look, missy, this is my detail. I started it.

723
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:38,300
Now, I'm asking,
do you have charges on Frank Sobotka?

724
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,900
Charging Sobotka at this point
would lose us the wire...

725
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,600
and a chance at the real targets.

726
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,100
-He is the real target.
-Patience, Stan.

727
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,400
-I'm sure if they bring the case--
-You owe me on this, Erv.

728
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,000
You asked for a detail, I gave you a detail.

729
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,500
You asked for Daniels, I gave you Daniels.

730
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,900
Okay.

731
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,100
Now the votes are in...

732
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,200
and you're moving your damn golf trophies
upstairs to the commissioner's office...

733
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,400
now you're freezing me out, huh?

734
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,700
Fucking rat fuckers, all of you.

735
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,200
This is my case.

736
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,800
Mine!

737
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,500
And now you're gonna tell me
who the target is?

738
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,000
Not fucking likely.

739
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,200
He's saying no.

740
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,200
He's saying we fought for
every one of them Towers...

741
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,800
and to give them up now
would mark us as weak.

742
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,900
He's saying if we do this,
Prop Joe would have it over us...

743
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,400
and we might never get out from under.

744
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:52,100
-We don't have the product or the muscle.
-I told him.

745
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,100
I did.

746
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,300
He say he still trying to find us
a better connect.

747
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,100
And for muscle...

748
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,100
he's saying he sending us
the best he can find.

749
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,900
Brother Mouzone.

750
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,900
He sending in Brother?

751
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,300
From New York.

752
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,900
Coming down to work on retainer,
for as long as we need.

753
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,700
-Brother Mouzone?
-Yep.

754
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,600
"At which point
the officer was unable to resist...

755
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,400
"the ministrations
of the aforementioned suspect...

756
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,700
"and found himself
brought to the point of a sexual act."

757
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,300
You're famous behind this, you know that?

758
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,600
As a pervert,
this report is gonna make you a BPD legend.

759
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,100
I can't perjure myself.
I gotta explain it somehow.

760
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,600
Motherfucker, you have violated
a half dozen departmental regs right there.

761
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:59,600
Not to mention that no state's attorney
is gonna even bring this thing into court.

762
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,200
We're not going to court.
The girls are being deported.

763
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,400
We did the raid
just to tickle the wire, remember?

764
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,200
There were two of them. I was outnumbered.

765
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,600
You fucking with me, right?

766
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,700
Brother Mouzone, from NYC?

767
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:34,000
I went to Avon, told him I didn't have
enough muscle to hold down them Towers.

768
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,300
-Played it like that.
-Yeah, and he reached out.

769
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,300
Joe, I'm still holding on to this deal.

770
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,400
Know what I'm saying?
This is just some shit we gotta deal with.

771
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,200
Deal with how?

772
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,900
My nigger, I would take
the motherfucker out if I could...

773
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,400
but Avon can't know
it came from his own people, right?

774
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,500
You don't think I'm gonna send
any of my people up against Brother?

775
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,800
Shit.

776
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,100
That nigger got more bodies on him
than a Chinese cemetery.

777
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,200
True.

778
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:02,800
Look, I'm just saying,
this your problem, not mine.

779
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,700
You want my product,
you need to deal with it.

780
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,400
All right, so listen, we got some time here.

781
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,700
Avon gotta send up word
and wait for word to come back...

782
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,200
set up a price, talk to Brother Mouzone,
I mean, set up the whole shit.

783
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,000
And that's like a week or maybe two.

784
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,700
And by that time,
your people's gonna be in the Towers...

785
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,800
and if the money's right,
then that is what it is.

786
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:27,700
Ain't no nigger from New York
gonna change the facts from the ground.

787
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,900
All right?

788
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,300
1 2-08 to 1 1-37, you there?

789
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,700
1 1-37, what you got?

790
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,100
That last truck is on the move.

791
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,000
It sits there for two days
and they don't offload a thing.

792
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,300
-10-4.
-They're testing us.

793
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,500
They been moving clean cans.

794
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,100
-The trash hasn't drawn any flies.
-No?

795
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,300
-Wejust took out the last of it. No problems.
-Okay, then we go.

796
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,200
-What about llona?
-She is home. They kept the children.

797
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,800
There are always more children.

798
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:23,700
Why don't we tap that cell phone,
even if we don't know who we're tapping?

799
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,200
That call might just be our PC.

800
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,700
And this here is the little king of everything.

801
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,000
So how many we got in the sector?

802
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:51,100
Double shift, plus the Flex Squad, DEU...

803
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,700
and a dozen guys Tactical sent us.

804
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,600
We're on every corner.

805
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,500
Pretty damn quiet today.

806
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,300
Today.

807
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,200
Let's go.

808
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,000
Officer.

809
00:56:52,305 --> 00:57:52,933

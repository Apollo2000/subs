00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,032
Can you take care of our friend?

168
00:07:16,057 --> 00:07:17,574
No problem.

169
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:20,413
- Maggie?
- Yes.

170
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:23,346
Let Dr. Charles know
that Jamie's down here.

171
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:24,846
Sure thing.

172
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:26,998
Deep breath.

173
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:29,947
[Jamie inhales, coughs]

174
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:32,047
Hey, Jamie.

175
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:37,181
Maybe today... wasn't
such... a good day to drop in.

176
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,587
Oh, we always got time for you.

177
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:43,082
Let's get a CBC, a CMP, Coags,
a chest X-ray, and an ABG.

178
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:46,118
Now, Mr. Dilson, I see that
you're use inhaled antibiotics,

179
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,614
Tobramycin, Albuterol.

180
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,962
You wear a vibration jacket
at night and use a humidifier.

181
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:54,026
- Yeah.
- That's all good.

182
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:57,363
- I caught... a cold.
- A whopper.

183
00:07:57,365 --> 00:07:58,931
Well, we got to make sure

184
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:00,399
that it doesn't turn into pneumonia.

185
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:01,633
You've had a few episodes.

186
00:08:01,635 --> 00:08:04,236
A few means... three.

187
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:06,958
[labored breathing] I've had... more.

188
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,951
Well, we're going to take
good care of you here, okay?

189
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:10,519
- You're at Northwestern?
- Yeah.

190
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:11,822
Well, we better get you out of here quick

191
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:14,052
so you don't miss those mid-terms.

192
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,810
Make a fist.

193
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:19,033
Hey, who's my next patient?

194
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:20,763
The Red Tags have all been handled.

195
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:22,254
Why don't you sit down for a minute?

196
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,079
You know, exercise is
good for pregnant women.

197
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,104
Come on. Next patient.

198
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:28,705
- All right. Treatment 1.
- Thank you.

199
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,643
- Crib party Sunday.
- Crib party?

200
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:31,767
Maggie and I are gonna come by,

201
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:33,302
help you put the baby's crib together.

202
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:37,136
I'll bring the Allen wrenches
and deep dish from Kitchen 17.

203
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:38,972
You guys do not have to do that.

204
00:08:38,997 --> 00:08:40,986
Not if you think that you're gonna do

205
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:42,844
the single-mom thing all by yourself,

206
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:44,479
not with us around.

207
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:46,048
Takes a village.

208
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,749
Thanks, guys.

209
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:50,436
I don't know what I'd do without you.

210
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:54,950
Why am I putting in this bolt?

211
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:56,416
Where's my good-for-nothing resident?

212
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:58,841
Put in her 12 hours. Had to knock off.

213
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:03,627
These new rules... ridiculous,
and bad for medicine.

214
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:07,787
"Oh, I'm so tired. Oh, I can't work."

215
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:10,362
Everybody's so damn spoiled,
the whole generation.

216
00:09:10,387 --> 00:09:13,354
Gina? Gina! Oh, my God.

217
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:14,794
- Mrs. Donahue...
- What happened to her?

218
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:16,230
Dr. Abrams, Dr. Halstead,

219
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,856
this is Mrs. Donahue, the baby's mother.

220
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:23,432
Thanks, Maggie.

221
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,740
You're the baby's mother?

222
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:29,332
Biological mother.

223
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,533
My husband Joel and I,
he's... he's at work.

224
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:34,158
He's on his way here. We're the parents.

225
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,060
Gina's our surrogate.

226
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:39,757
Opening pressure's 18. I'm done.

227
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:42,578
Look at her. [sniffs]

228
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:47,199
Is she going to be okay... and the baby?

229
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:49,357
- Baby checks out fine.
- [gasps] Oh!

230
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:50,722
Healthy heartbeat.

231
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:53,469
Amniotic sac and placenta are intact.

232
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,186
Gina, though, I'm afraid,

233
00:09:56,211 --> 00:10:00,368
suffered a traumatic head injury
and so far, she's unresponsive.

234
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,000
We need to contact her family,
if you have any information.

235
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:07,924
My husband and I are
pretty much her family.

236
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:10,259
She... she's been living with us since

237
00:10:10,284 --> 00:10:11,929
before the embryo was implanted.

238
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:13,130
Okay.

239
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:15,800
She's gonna get better, isn't she?

240
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:16,911
She's gonna be okay?

241
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:18,402
I can't promise anything.

242
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:20,521
[cries]

243
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,120
No, I can't believe this.

244
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:26,626
What about the baby?

245
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:28,746
It's too soon to deliver, isn't it?

246
00:10:28,748 --> 00:10:30,281
She's only 24 weeks.

247
00:10:30,283 --> 00:10:31,949
Yes, the baby needs more time.

248
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:33,611
What does that mean?

249
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:35,939
Are we gonna lose our child, too?

250
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:37,613
- Oh, my God.
- No, Mrs. Donahue.

251
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:41,514
I'm not saying that, and
I'm not giving up on Gina,

252
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:43,832
but if the worst did happen,

253
00:10:43,857 --> 00:10:46,707
it might be possible to
keep her on life support

254
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:49,907
long enough for the fetus to become viable.

255
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:54,407
So... so what, Gina just becomes...

256
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:57,292
a human incubator?

257
00:10:57,317 --> 00:10:59,684
We're not there yet.

258
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,739
Dr. Rhodes, I thought you could use these.

259
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:21,649
Thank you.

260
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,332
How'd that happen?

261
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:25,757
Must have snagged it on the wreckage.

262
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:29,106
You know, we do have a
couple of doctors around here.

263
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:30,340
I could hook you up.

264
00:11:30,365 --> 00:11:33,010
I don't need one, but I
could use a nurse though.

265
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,533
Come be my other hand.

266
00:11:35,558 --> 00:11:37,391
Oh, nice.

267
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:39,567
You closed that like a plastic surgeon.

268
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:40,825
Where'd you pick that up?

269
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,192
Riyadh.

270
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:45,078
Spent a year there after my residency.

271
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:48,492
Saudis paid me well not
to leave unsightly scars.

272
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:51,365
Could you pinch those two sides together?

273
00:11:51,471 --> 00:11:52,903
- There we go.
- What about a tetanus shot?

274
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:56,897
No, I am current, April, uh...

275
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:59,070
April Sexton.

276
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:00,377
English? Irish?

277
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:02,302
My family's from Brazil.

278
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,536
Our real last name is Sanguessuga,

279
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:07,927
but my parents thought
Sexton sounded more American,

280
00:12:07,952 --> 00:12:10,109
and people could actually pronounce it.

281
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:11,380
Where're you from?

282
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:12,780
Chicago.

283
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,768
Born and bred.

284
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,560
Been away for a while.

285
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:18,284
Welcome home.

286
00:12:22,212 --> 00:12:24,646
Two and four. Three is headed to the OR.

287
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:25,585
All righty.

288
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,297
Who's young Rambo over there?

289
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:28,687
Hmm?

290
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:32,929
Oh, that's Connor Rhodes,
the new trauma fellow.

291
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:33,780
Mm-hmm.

292
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:36,534
He's gonna light up some
estrogen receptors around here.

293
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,130
I'll say. He lit mine.

294
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:39,454
Well, that's all I need.

295
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:42,412
- Where's Jamie again?
- Treatment 5.

296
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,405
[murmurs] a dream.

297
00:12:48,803 --> 00:12:50,255
Your daughter's stable.

298
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,903
She has a pretty serious leg fracture,

299
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:54,182
but she's okay, just a little shaken up.

300
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:56,651
The orthopedic resident is on
his way to put a cast on her.

301
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,487
And what about my husband?
I can't get any information...

302
00:12:58,489 --> 00:12:59,688
We made some calls.

303
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,456
Your husband's down the road at Sinai.

304
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,373
They were able to stabilize him,
but his injuries are serious.

305
00:13:04,398 --> 00:13:06,498
The last word I had, he
was headed into surgery.

306
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,397
How is this happening?

307
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,132
They were just going on a
father-daughter day trip.

308
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:11,500
She wanted to go to the zoo. What...

309
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:14,372
Ms. Lewis, the best
thing you can do right now

310
00:13:14,397 --> 00:13:15,974
is just be there for your daughter.

311
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:18,199
We'll keep checking on your husband, okay?

312
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:20,402
All right.

313
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:23,028
[machines beep]

314
00:13:23,257 --> 00:13:26,239
There. You can see her feet and a hand.

315
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,880
Everything looks good,
Mr. and Mrs. Donahue.

316
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:31,273
Oh, thank you for doing this.
We just needed to see her again.

317
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:38,762
She... she just squeezed my hand.

318
00:13:38,787 --> 00:13:40,468
I swear, I felt it.

319
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:41,897
Her reflexes are still intact.

320
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,297
Movement can occur,
but it's not purposeful.

321
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,512
No, she... she just did it again,

322
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:49,793
right when you wiped her stomach.

323
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:51,498
She responded.

324
00:13:58,293 --> 00:14:00,271
Tell me that wasn't purposeful.

325
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:03,508
Dr. Troy, let's get a repeat CAT scan.

326
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:07,474
You haven't seen... even one?

327
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:10,300

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

I got a lot of catching up to do.

- Well, the last one's the best.
- How about this?

336
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:32,447
I'm gonna start with the

00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,417
Big mistake. Beats me every time.

Jamie, I've got your test results back.

350
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,320
I wish they were a little more encouraging.

351
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:07,896
You're pancytopenic, which means
that your cell counts are low.

352
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:11,199
You've got a blood pH of
7.14, which means that you...

353
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:13,524
I know.

354
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:16,846
I'd like to intubate you, put you to sleep,

355
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:18,237
get you on a ventilator.

356
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,639
You're getting fatigued.

357
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:20,907
This would just allow you to rest

358
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:22,808
so that the antibiotics can do their job.

359
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,571
I've been intubated eight times.

360
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:28,796
I think I'll skip it.

361
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:33,355
All right. I'll check back in later, huh?

she's exhibiting movement,
and she's improved to a 6.

- Yeah.

You said that she was getting better.

00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:36,602
Well, she is, in that her
function was improving,

but the swelling of her
brain is getting worse.

444

We're gonna try to
control it with medication.

445
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,225
And what if the medication doesn't work?

446
00:19:44,227 --> 00:19:46,443
Then she'll require surgery.

447
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,207
The procedure's called a
"decompressive craniectomy."

448
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:52,143
Would that be dangerous to the baby?

449
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:54,963
There is always a risk for the fetus,

450

and for the mother as well, so, yes.

him? A week? Ten days?

It could be six months, a year, more,

and in that time, anything could happen.

New treatments are coming along every day.

Now, is he on the list?

00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,520
Right at the top, but a
match is highly unlikely.

470

He has HLA antibodies from
an islet cell transplant.

476
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:06,707
you know what's gonna happen.

477
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:08,652
Jamie will lose consciousness,

478
00:21:08,677 --> 00:21:10,968
and as his doctor, I'm gonna
put him on a ventilator,

479
00:21:10,993 --> 00:21:13,753
but by then it may be too late,

480
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:16,128

- What?

491
00:21:59,672 --> 00:22:02,272
No, no. He's okay. He's still in surgery.

492
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:03,863
The OR nurse says it's going well.

493
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:06,150
As soon as we hear
something, I'll let you know.

494
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:08,982
Rachel?

495
00:22:09,656 --> 00:22:11,773
Rachel, can you hear me? What is wrong?

496
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,564
What's happening?

497
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:16,349
- I can't find a pulse.
- Oh, my God.

You're not compressing the heart, Sarah.

504
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:38,391
- You gotta go harder.
- But she's so small.

505
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,343
- I don't want to...
- Harder! Do it, let's go!

506
00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:45,368
Come on, Sarah! Harder!

507
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,591
Hold!

508
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:51,425
There we go. Back in sinus. Get a BP.

509
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,789
What happened?

510
00:22:52,814 --> 00:22:55,348
She arrested. We got her back.

511
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,568
I can't get an IV.

512

- [saw whirs]

All right, let's get her a

515

Mom, you can come with us.

516

Good job.

I-I just...

518
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:22,498
I just broke a little girl's ribs.

You know more about CF than most doctors.

522
00:23:43,926 --> 00:23:45,525
I'm an expert.

523
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,338
So you know what will happen

No, no, no. Jamie, look at me.

00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:14,305
It's me, your corner man.

533
00:24:16,357 --> 00:24:19,145
You got a lot of fight left in you.

534
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,008
I'm not ready to throw in the towel.

535
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:24,070
One more round.

536
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,681
For you?

537
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:33,034
Yeah. For me.

538
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,440
Yeah, okay. Okay.

00:24:45,857 --> 00:24:47,672
Mariana?

540
00:24:48,006 --> 00:24:51,274
Hi. I'm Maggie.

541
00:24:51,518 --> 00:24:55,420
This... this is Jorge's.

542
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:57,764
- <i>Entiendes?</i>
- Yes.

543
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:03,273
Inside... I found this.

"From J.M. to M.A."

545
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:21,020
You're not his girlfriend.

546
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:25,514
You're his fiancée.

547
00:25:25,743 --> 00:25:31,948
- Prometida.
- Prometida.

548
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,490
Jorge.

549
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:01,855
[elevator bell rings]

550
00:26:03,454 --> 00:26:07,222
Natalie, what happened
with the little girl?

551
00:26:07,247 --> 00:26:09,292
She had a cardiac contusion.

552
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,650
Bruising caused her to arrest.

553
00:26:10,675 --> 00:26:13,224
She's good now, but it was a real scare.

554
00:26:13,249 --> 00:26:14,615
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

555
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:24,725
Your comatose guy...

556
00:26:24,994 --> 00:26:27,695
seems like you'd want to put
him on the hypothermic protocol

557
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,886
and protect his brain.

558
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:31,573
Well, I just gave him 20 units of blood.

559
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:33,768
His pH is only 7.2,

560
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:35,826
and he's too cold to make a clot,

561
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:38,729
so I didn't see how
the hypothermic protocol

562
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,597
would help him.

563
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:42,922
Hey, you're the fellow.
I'm just a resident.

564
00:26:42,947 --> 00:26:45,541
Heard you're local. Me, too.

565
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:47,532
Where'd you grow up?

566
00:26:47,557 --> 00:26:48,856
Lake Shore Drive.

567
00:26:48,881 --> 00:26:51,949
[whistles] Nice.

568
00:26:51,974 --> 00:26:54,973
Well, I doubt we have
any friends in common.

569
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,820
Canaryville. Oh.

570
00:26:58,845 --> 00:27:01,990
Where'd you go to med school?
Johns Hopkins? Stanford?

571
00:27:02,015 --> 00:27:03,748
No. I went to UAG.

572
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:06,165
- Where's that?
- Guadalajara.

573
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,770
Didn't see that coming. [phone beeps]

574
00:27:10,377 --> 00:27:12,634
Got to go.

575
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,449
Her ICP is unresponsive?

576
00:27:24,474 --> 00:27:26,225
Her CPP is 40.

577
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,216
Sherry, get me Dr. Abrams.

578
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:30,441
You... you're planning to do the surgery?

579
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:31,565
What about our baby?

580
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,723
The meds we've been giving Gina

581
00:27:32,748 --> 00:27:33,950
haven't been effective.

582
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:36,121
Her intracranial pressure,
the brain swelling,

583
00:27:36,146 --> 00:27:37,496
is getting to a dangerous level,

584
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:38,520
and we shouldn't wait any longer.

585
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:40,255
I'm not sure we can consent to that.

586
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:41,873
It's not really a matter of consent.

587
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:43,997
Well, actually, Doctor, it is.

588
00:27:44,022 --> 00:27:46,188
We have a surrogacy contract with Gina.

589
00:27:46,296 --> 00:27:49,031
A rider to that is a
Medical Power of Attorney,

590
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:50,394
giving us the right to make decisions

591
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,458
on Gina's behalf.

592
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:53,250
I don't see how we can
sign off on a procedure

593
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:54,927
knowing it will endanger our child.

594
00:27:54,952 --> 00:27:57,686
Mr. and Mrs. Donahue,
Gina needs this surgery.

595
00:27:57,711 --> 00:27:59,080
It's her only hope.

596
00:27:59,105 --> 00:28:01,372
But it's not a guarantee
she's gonna recover.

597
00:28:01,397 --> 00:28:04,598
No, but without the surgery,
I can guarantee she won't.

598
00:28:09,074 --> 00:28:11,274
You would just allow
her condition to worsen?

599
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:12,843
This is our child!

600
00:28:12,868 --> 00:28:15,769
What would you do to save your child?

601

00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:26,880
I'll take over!

605
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,764
Ma'am, I'm sorry, we need some more room.

606
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:31,231

- Hold compressions.

607

- No pulse.

Amp of Epi, max of Dopamine, max of Vaso.

610
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:43,729
You're gonna max him on pressors.

611
00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:47,280
Don't have a choice. Pads.

612
00:28:58,024 --> 00:28:59,492
That contract's obscene.

613
00:28:59,494 --> 00:29:01,346
I mean, the Donahues control everything,

614
00:29:01,371 --> 00:29:03,118
what Gina can eat, drink,
how much she sleeps,

615
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:04,095
even what she wears.

616
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,753
We have to perform this operation.

617
00:29:05,755 --> 00:29:06,908
Well, I'd advise against that

618
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:08,618
because this is really comprehensive,

619
00:29:08,643 --> 00:29:10,524
and nicely drawn up, I might add.

620
00:29:10,526 --> 00:29:12,315
The lady probably didn't even
know what she was signing.

621
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,067
We can't prove that.

622
00:29:14,092 --> 00:29:15,925
We can't just stand by and let her die.

623
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,083
I guarantee if we perform this operation,

624
00:29:18,108 --> 00:29:19,253
regardless of the outcome,

625
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:21,011
we'll be sued, and they'll likely win,

626
00:29:21,036 --> 00:29:22,265
and millions.

627
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,922
And that's how we make our decisions?

628
00:29:23,924 --> 00:29:25,224
By how much it's gonna cost us?

629
00:29:25,226 --> 00:29:27,906
All right, get off the
high horse, Dr. Halstead.

630
00:29:28,064 --> 00:29:30,098
How about we call the Ethics Committee?

631
00:29:30,475 --> 00:29:31,974
Be faster to call a judge,

632
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:33,706
but I'm not gonna burn a favor on this.

633
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,097
This is ridiculous!

634
00:29:35,122 --> 00:29:36,912
Why aren't you trying to help us?

635
00:29:36,937 --> 00:29:39,858
He is, and you need to back off!

636
00:29:44,213 --> 00:29:47,104
So much easier to run a
hospital without doctors.

637
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:48,996
Please.

638
00:29:51,912 --> 00:29:56,393
Jorge's brain was without
oxygen for too long.

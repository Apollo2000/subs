1
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,296
<i>It's a simple game.</i>

2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,376
You have 15 players.
Give one of them the ball,

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,016
get it into the net.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,616
Very simple.
Isn't it?

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,016
Oh, what?
Oh.

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,160
Brilliant.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,136
How's it going, Rachel?

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,616
Talking tactics, there, for the game.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,296
We're getting a master class.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,336
How incredibly boring of you.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,297
Yeah.

12
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:39,880
- Did you get your hair done?
- I did, yeah.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,816
It's very pretty.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,336
Thanks.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,720
Can I use my locker, by any chance?
Yeah.

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,256
Yeah, I sort of need you
to move, Connell.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,536
Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

18
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:55,256
"Uh, sorry. Ex‐squeeze me."

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,296
All right, relax, will ya?

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,736
But you know that's important.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,376
Because it's turned up in the exam twice
out of the last three years.

22
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,600
Marianne?

23
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,216
Yeah?

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,200
Something outside caught your attention?

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,416
I suppose so.

26
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,000
Eyes forward, okay?

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,656
I wasn't aware my eye line fell under
the jurisdiction of school rules.

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,656
Here we go. Jesus.
Trying to impress your classmates?

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,336
They don't look too impressed to me.

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,856
I'm pretty sure I was just
looking out the window.

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,496
Come on, Sheridan.

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,536
If you're staring
out the window daydreaming,

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,616
then you're not learning,
are you, Marianne?

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,096
Don't hurt yourself.
I have nothing to learn from you.

35
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,856
Okay, in that case, principal's office.

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,560
Yeah. I might go there.

37
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,256
Or I might just head home.

38
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,160
It's not really your business what I do,
is it?

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,976
Don't worry, sir.
She's a psycho to everybody.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,056
Do you want to follow her, Folan?

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,280
- Hey.
- Hey.

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,640
Come on in. Your mum's in the kitchen.

43
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,320
Hey, love.

44
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,456
Marianne was telling me
you got your mock results back today.

45
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,680
Uh, just English.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,456
They come back separately.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,816
I hear you did very well.

48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,000
- He did.
- Yeah, well...

49
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,920
Marianne did pretty good, too.

50
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,736
Can we go?

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,280
Didn't realize we were in a rush.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,976
Just put these away,
and then we'll be off.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,720
- Immediately, okay?
- Mm‐hmm.

54
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Do you want some?
N‐no thanks.

55
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,200
Didn't you get French back today?
Yesterday.

56
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Yeah.

57
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,680
Got an A1.

58
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,136
What'd you get in German?

59
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,256
Are you bragging?

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,776
Got an A1.

61
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,176
Ah, you're gonna get 600,
are ya?

62
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,336
You probably will.

63
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,056
Yeah, well, you're smarter
than me, so...

64
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,480
Smarter than everyone.

65
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,840
Ah, well, you're not
top of the class in English.

66
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,840
Maybe you should
give me grinds, Connell.

67
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,096
- Good to go?
- Yeah.

68
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,440
Oy.

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,376
Thanks for everything, Lorraine.

70
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,040
Tell your mum
I'll clean upstairs tomorrow.

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,056
Did you rob the place?

72
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,256
What?

73
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,960
The quick getaway.

74
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,896
You could have said goodbye.
I did.

75
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,856
She doesn't exactly have
an easy time of it, Connell.

76
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,896
You could try being a bit nicer to her.

77
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,056
I am nice to her.

78
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,096
She's actually a very sensitive person.

79
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,240
Oh, look. Can we talk about
something else, please?

80
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,216
You enjoying your book there, Marianne?

81
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,920
I said,
are you enjoying your book?

82
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,536
You're not getting distracted
by the fuckin' window, are you?

83
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,520
That is absolutely tragic.

84
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,040
That's it, that's it, Connell. That's it.

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,560
Right. Let's focus it. Yeah. Here.

86
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,560
Beautiful. Keep it going, boys.
Fast, fast, fast.

87
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,256
Sorry. Am I disturbing you, Marianne?

88
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,680
No.

89
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,696
If I knew what I wanted to study,
I'd obviously tell you.

90
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,856
Well, you must have some idea.

91
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,416
No. I know what I don't want to study,
but that's about it.

92
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,056
Jesus, how long is that list?

93
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,056
Fairly long.

94
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,176
That's a great way to decide, Connell.

95
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,456
Rule out marine biology and astrophysics,

96
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,496
and all the rest
till you're left with one.

97
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,080
I could be a marine biologist.

98
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,696
Yeah, that sounds like
your area of interest, all right.

99
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,720
You've not got long. Forms are due soon.
Yeah. I'm aware.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,840
Is this just out?

101
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,976
About five minutes ago.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,640
Made some salad.

103
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,800
Could you not have drawn the curtains,
Marianne?

104
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,936
It's literally only just getting dark.

105
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,736
You've got the heating on full
and the curtains wide open.

106
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,616
Did you have a good day?

107
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,696
Depends on what you mean by good.

108
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,616
You can get rid of one client
and another one arrives.

109
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,080
Isn't that good business?

110
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,080
Yes.

111
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,056
Where's your brother?

112
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,496
Don't shrug, Marianne.

113
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,480
I don't know. I haven't seen him.

114
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,760
And how was school?
Okay.

115
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,296
Got some results back.

116
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,456
- Mocks.
- And?

117
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,616
Good.

118
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,576
Good.

119
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,256
Is there any food?

120
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,416
Your sister's reheated a lasagne.

121
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,520
Oh, good effort, Marianne.

122
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,136
How was your day?
All right.

123
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,696
Not too busy.

124
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,816
You out this evening?

125
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,816
Yeah.

126
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,176
'Cause I got this thing called
a social life.

127
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,480
Right.

128
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,680
You know, like, actual friends.

129
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,920
Lucky you.

130
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,376
<i>Fermanagh now
completing the list of qualifiers.</i>

131
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,336
<i>Draw for the next round
will be held on Thursday.</i>

132
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,336
<i>Finally, at the Cricket World Cup today,
it's the semi‐final clash, as India...</i>

133
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,376
Hello? GER:
<i>Alan, it's Ger. How's it going?</i>

134
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,856
Good, yeah.
<i>Uh, listen, I'm after missing the bus,</i>

135
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,136
<i>and I hate to ask you,
but any chance of a lift in?</i>

136
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,216
Yeah, no bother at all, man.
You at the house, eh?

137
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,376
I'll swing around for you now.
<i>Oh, thank you so much.</i>

138
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,496
Sound. Stall it there. I'll see you
in a few. <i>Yeah, oh, you're a star.</i>

139
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,256
What are you doing?

140
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,576
Uh, did you not hear
that entire call?

141
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,880
I have to go pick up Ger out in Garryduff.
You hop out here.

142
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,096
Are you serious? I'll get drenched.

143
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,896
Right. Shit buzz for you, pal.

144
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,976
Maybe you should learn to drive.

145
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,200
Go on.

146
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,016
"It was sliding beneath
the big, black wave."

147
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,296
"Another and another.

148

Then I was back in it. The war was‐‐".

149
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,656
Class begins at nine, Marianne.

150
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,440
Yeah.
Thanks for that.

151
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,520
Excuse me?

152
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,136
Can you just give me a detention
and move on?

153
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,360
Quiet.

154
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,896
"Then I was back in it.

155
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,936
"The war was on outside,

in Worcester, Massachusetts..."

157
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,616
I'm having people over Friday,
after the match.

158
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,736
Come celebrate, or drown your sorrows.

159
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,336
Whatever.

160
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,296
Yeah. Sounds good.

161
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,296
What happened to you
this morning, Marianne?

162
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,416
You're looking a bit
on the drowned rat side.

163
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,376
Thanks, yeah. It was raining.

164
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,920
You should have brought an umbrella.

165
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,576
Good advice.

166
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,256
You strip off in the toilets
to dry yourself again?

167
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,616
Not this time. No. Why?

168
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,176
Would you like an invitation next time?

169
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,176
<i>"Just give me detention,</i>

170
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,296
<i>and move on."</i>

171
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,640
- That was a good one.
- Glad you enjoyed it.

172
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,256
The shit you get away with
'cause you're smart.

173
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,016
I understand you're at
a disadvantage there, Rob.

174
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,736
Fuck off.

175
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Hey.

176
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,040
You're not heading home, no?

177
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,560
I did actually get a detention.

178
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,136
Sorry.

179
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,200
Technically, I requested it.

180
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,720
You were fairly harsh
on Kerrigan the other day, as well.

181
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,656
He's actually pretty decent.

182
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,640
I don't know why you had to have
such a go at him.

183
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,296
I object to every thought or action,
or...

184
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,496
feeling of mine being policed
like we're in some authoritarian fantasy.

185
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,616
Well, it's not that, though, is it?
It's just school.

186
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,696
It's the same for everybody.
It's not unique for you.

187
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,336
You try to act like we're friends,

188
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,680
but you know you're
not that kind of person.

189
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,480
I'm not acting.

190
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,400
Maybe I am that kind of person.

191
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,776
Why are you talking to me, then?

192
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,840
Yeah.

193
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,456
What was Ms. Neary
talking to you about after class?

194
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,536
Oh, don't know. Uh...

195
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,056
getting out of class early for training
or something.

196
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,656
She must find training
highly amusing, then.

197
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Well.

198
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,160
Does she fancy you or something?

199
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,800
Why'd you say that?

200
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,496
God, you're not having
an affair with her, are you?

201
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,800
Please. You think it's funny joking
about stuff like that, do you?

202
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,816
Sorry.
People going at me like I fancy her. I‐‐

203
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,880
I don't fancy her.

204
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,896
Well...

205
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,856
maybe it's because you blush a lot
when she talks to you.

206
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,136
Aah.

207
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,016
But you know, you blush at everything.

208
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,336
Thanks.

209
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,136
Guess you have one of those complexions.

210
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,240
Great.

211
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,736
You're blushing right now, actually.

212
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,720
Yeah. I'm aware.

213
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,680
Sorry.

214
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,056
I don't want to get into a fight
with you or anything.

215
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,936
We're not fighting.

216
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,440
I know you... probably hate me.

217
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,456
But you're the only person
who actually talks to me.

218
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,040
I never said that I hated you.

219
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,696
Well...

220
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,040
I like you.

221
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,880
Oh.

222
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Got to head to training, so, uh...

223
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,016
Good luck at the match tomorrow.

224
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,120
Thanks.

225
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,480
Marianne, you gonna join us?

226
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,320
Come on, lads. In you go.

227
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,520
Keep going, keep going.

228
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,520
Come on, sink his ass!

229
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,640
Fuck!

230
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,176
Push through it, Kiernan!
Come on!

231
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,400
Come on!
Score!

232
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,320
Yeah!

233
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,976
Yeah!

234
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,216
Fuck, we did it!

235
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,840
Fuck!

236
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,160
Come on!

237
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,920
Grand.
Good lad.

238
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,560
Woo!

239
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,616
You're early. Come on in.

240
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,816
Have a bit do, yet.
Grand.

241
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,376
Quick as I can.

242
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,696
No, not in there.

243
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,336
I've just finished mopping.

244
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,016
And well done, man of the match.

245
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,376
Marianne told me.

246
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,480
Did she?
She did.

247
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,240
You played well today.

248
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,536
Oh, thanks.

249
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,200
That's nice of you.

250
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,520
I can be nice.
I know you can.

251
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,000
You know, the way you are in school,

252
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,200
I don't think you're like that, really.

253
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,160
What am I like, really?

254
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,280
Ah.

255
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,656
You can borrow it, if you like.

256
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,296
Oh, I‐I actually read it already.
I don't know why I picked it up.

257
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,736
Any good?
Yeah. I liked it.

258
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,016
You‐You'd like it, actually.

259
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,200
It's got a lot about feminism,
and all that.

260
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,096
Do your friends know you read so much?

261
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,480
Yeah, they wouldn't really be interested
in all that stuff.

262
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,136
You mean they're not interested
in the world around them?

263
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,496
Eh, not in the same way
that we would be,

264
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,040
but they have their own interests,
I suppose.

265
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,656
Right. Like, uh,

266
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,240
bragging about
who they're having sex with.

267
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,760
Yeah. They can do a bit of that.

268
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,296
I'm‐I'm not defending it.

269
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,536
Doesn't it bother you?

270
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,456
Most of it wouldn't.

271
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,816
And then they do some stuff
that's a bit over the line,

272
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,776
and that would bother me,
obviously, but...

273
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,680
they're my friends at the end of the day.
It's different for you.

274
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,320
Why is it different?

275
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,560
You know, um...

276
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,880
You were saying the other day
that you like me.

277
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,960
B‐by the photocopier, you said it.

278
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,056
Yeah.

279
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,176
Yeah. Did you mean "like" as...

280
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,400
a friend, or what?

281
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,240
No.

282
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,976
Not just as a friend.
Yeah.

283
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,800
I thought that might be implied.
I just... wasn't sure.

284
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,656
See, I'm...

285
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,936
just a little confused
about what I feel, I think.

286
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,280
Uh, it'd be awkward in school
if something happened with us.

287
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,280
No one would have to know.

288
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,960
That was nice.

289
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,736
What, what are you laughing for?

290
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,416
Nothing.

291
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,416
Well, you're acting like you've
never been kissed before.

292
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,456
I haven't.

293
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,560
- Connell.
- Uh...

294
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,560
Don't tell anybody
in school about this, all right?

295
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,000
Like I talk to anyone at school.

296
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,696
Yeah, I'll pop in for a bit, all right.
See ya in there.

297
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah, busy. Yeah.
See you inside, all right?

298
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
All right?

299
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,600
How's things, boss? Keeping well, yeah?

300
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,720
All right. Thanks.

301
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,400
Come here to me. Fair play to ya.

302
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,216
- Man of the hour!
- Ah, no, not really.

303
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,656
Thought you'd change your mind.

304
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,160
Oh.
Well, I'm glad you're here.

305
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,040
Shots.

306
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,856
Go on, get that into ya.
Cheers. All right.

307
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,976
Cheers!

308
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,536
Cheers!

309
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,096
How's the craic, Waldron?
All right.

310
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,600
You were on form on Friday.

311
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,496
So you were feelin' it, were you?

312
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,496
He was almost as drunk as Rachel.

313
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,616
Fuck off, Rob.
You passed out in a hedge.

314
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,416
That, I did. It was a good night.

315
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,800
- From what I can remember.
- It was a good night.

316
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,616
Hey.
All right.

317
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,976
Waldron?
Yeah.

318
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,416
Have you got that French homework, there?

319
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,976
Yeah, I do. Yeah.
Can I get it off you before break?

320
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,560
Give it to you now. I have it handy.

321
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,736
You're a lifesaver, man.

322
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,680
Throw it back to me, yeah?
Yeah.

323
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,560
Hiya.

324
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,880
Your mum's not here.
Yeah, um...

325
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,120
Can I come in?

326
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,280
Thanks.

327
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,816
You're not busy or anything, no?

328
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,880
No, I'm just...

329
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,320
Are you going to start kissing me again?

330
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,856
Can we take our clothes off?

331
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,720
No.

332
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,600
Not here. It's...

333
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,600
Uh...

334
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,360
Uh...

335
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
Got a free house on Saturday.

336
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,520
You could come over then,
if you wanted to.

337
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,216
Will anyone else be there?

338
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,280
No.

339
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,176
Are you sure we can't
take our clothes off?

340
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,440
Oh, no. Yeah.

341
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,760
I said I'd take Lorraine to the shops,
and this is, uh...

342
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,696
You were tempted, though, for a second.

343
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,160
Not really.

344
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,576
You were tempted.

345
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,120
I tempted you.

346
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,600
So you'll come on Saturday?

347
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,680
<i>Everyone's a mystery, in a way.</i>

348
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,040
<i>I mean, you can never really know
another person.</i>

349
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,760
<i>Do you actually think that, though?</i>

350
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,136
<i>Do your friends know about us,
that we were together?</i>

351
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,576
<i>No.</i>

352
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,320
No one would have to know.

353
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,536
<i>I just like talking to you.</i>

354
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,576
<i>How do you know what you want?</i>

355
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,776
Most of the time, I don't have a clue.

356
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,160
What about now?

357
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,960
I feel nothing for you. Nothing.

358
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,240
Why are you saying this?

359
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,536
<i>It's funny.</i>

360
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,896
The decisions you make
when you like someone,

361
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,760
<i>and then your whole life is different.</i>

362
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,760
<i>It's not like this with other people.</i>

1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,386
You guys were the ones
calling out and making a racket.

2
00:00:02,388 --> 00:00:03,561
I thought you needed help,

3
00:00:03,563 --> 00:00:04,722
but now you're acting
like I'm the one

4
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:06,188
causing a problem here?

5
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,275
Damn. I haven't seen anyone
in over a year,

6
00:00:09,277 --> 00:00:13,036
and the first ones I find
seem like a bunch of meanies.

7
00:00:13,038 --> 00:00:14,947
You just caught us
off guard.

8
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:18,041
- We didn't know if you were attacking...
- Seriously?

9
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:20,803
If I wanted to attack,
I'd hold the gun like this...

10
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:23,289
with the dangerous part
pointed at you, see?

11
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,215
That's for attacking.

12
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:27,643
The other way,
that's for hello.

13
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:31,631
So, as we can all agree,
I wasn't attacking.

14
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:34,800
But now...

15
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:36,819
Now I'm not so sure.

16
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:38,487
Maybe that's up to you.

17
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,322
Are you gonna hurt me?

18
00:00:40,324 --> 00:00:41,857
Keep pointing the damn gun
at us, and you'll find out.

19
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:46,170
No one has any intention
of hurting you.

20
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:51,317
We were just admiring
your displays.

21
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:53,744
Are they yours?

22
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:55,763
Crap. Sorry.

23
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:57,431
Do you like 'em?

24
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:59,600
Yeah, not many rotters
left in the city,

25
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:02,085
so I put these up
as my decorations.

26
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:04,087
Pain in the ass
to put together,

27
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:06,423
but they make the place
feel more alive.

28
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:10,853
Although now that I've met
actual live people again...

29
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:13,522
Hold on.

30
00:01:13,524 --> 00:01:16,025
You guys are real,
right?

31
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:19,345
- Is that supposed to be a joke?
- I dunno.

32
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:20,771
I mean,
I never hallucinated before,

33
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:22,290
but there's a first time
for everything.

34
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:23,849
Uh, say something
I wouldn't know.

35
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,659
Like, uh...

36
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:27,703
what's the capital
of Pennsylvania?

37
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:29,297
Harrisburg.

38
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:30,856
Did I know that?

39
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,207
I think I knew that.

40
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:34,710
Ha!
Maybe I am hallucinating.

41
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:36,378
- This is... This is wild.
- Hey.

42
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,464
You certain
it's just you out here?

43
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:39,974
Didn't I already
tell you that?

44
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:41,884
I've been on my own
for over a year,

45
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:44,812
and it totally sucks.

46
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:47,373
Da... Damn.
I should be nicer.

47
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,875
Talking to
possibly real people again

48
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:50,967
is making me freak out.

49
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:52,728
You... I'm just...

50
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,238
I'm just gonna shut up.

51
00:01:58,661 --> 00:01:59,976
I'm Juanita Sanchez.

52
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:02,054
But I never liked
the name Juanita.

53
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,739
You can call me Princess.

54
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:05,499
Why "Princess"?

55
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,394
Because "Queen"
makes me sound old.

56
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:10,046
And pretentious.

57
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:16,344
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Princess.

58
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:19,180
I am... Ezekiel.

59
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:21,665
And these are my friends,
Eugene and Yumiko.

60
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,059
Wow!

61
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,977
Let me show
you guys around.

62
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,429
We got plenty of space
for you to chill out,

63
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:29,081
put your feet up.

64
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,709
Y'all need supplies?
You need food?

65
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:33,009
Hair dye?

66
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:34,937
I've got a neat place
for us to swim

67
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,772
a couple blocks away.

68
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:38,941
We appreciate the hospitality,
but we can't stay.

69
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:41,443
Oh. O-Okay.

70
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:42,945
We're on
a very important mission.

71
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:44,597
Ohhh?!
What sorta mission?

72
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,356
Uh,
that's our business.

73
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,434
Well, let me least show you
the best way through the city.

74
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,378
- No, thank you.
- Oh, come on. Why not?

75
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,955
Because we don't know you.

76
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:54,773
Of course you do.

77
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,292
Princess?

78
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:59,220
I'm great.
You'll see.

79
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:06,727
Watch how helpful I can be.

80
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,062
No, wait. Please!

81
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:09,346
Don't...

82
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:19,907
No! No!

83
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:31,401
Damn.

84
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:32,586
Uh...

85
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:35,314
Sorry about that.

86
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:18,044

87
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,382
At least
it's not a total loss.

88
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:29,551
And we can still find
the horses tomorrow.

89
00:04:29,553 --> 00:04:31,203
Not to be a naysayer,

90
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,797
but our rendezvous window
is tighter than a tourniquet.

91
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:35,632
I have doubts
that it'll be possible

92
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:37,042
to make the journey
by foot.

93
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:39,211
Any additional day
spent on an empty search

94
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,213
would place us on
the failure side of that window.

95
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:44,049
So, if it's possible to walk,
we start now.

96
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,902
Missing this meeting
isn't an option.

97
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:49,663
We've got way too many people
counting on us back home.

98
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:53,149
What about Princess?
She offered to help.

99
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:54,210
Why don't
we take her up on it?

100
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:02,459
Absolutely not.

101
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:04,153
- What could it hurt?
- Plenty.

102
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:05,571
Anyone alone for this long

103
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:07,163
ends up selfish, crazy...

104
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:08,891
in her case, definitely both.

105
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:11,835
We can't trust her.

106
00:05:11,837 --> 00:05:14,838
I'm not suggesting
that we follow her blindly.

107
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,749
But if she knows how to find
transportation...

108
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:17,650
Then she wouldn't

109
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:20,176
still be here, alone.

110
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:22,530
Look, if she had a ride,
why hasn't she left?

111
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,281
It's a trap.

112
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,941
Is Princess a few bananas

113
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:27,426
short of a bunch?

114
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,427
Possibly.

115
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:29,428
Does she have access

116
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,429
to automobiles and working fuel?

117
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,780
Unlikely.

118
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:33,615
But at present,
we possess limited options,

119
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:37,044
so even a slim possibility
is worth investigating.

120
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,363
Apologies, Yumiko.

121
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:41,674
My vote's with the king.

122
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,562
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

123
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:56,564
I feel really bad about
what happened.

124
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:58,624
Let me make it up
to you guys.

125
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:00,359
You mentioned you had access
to some transportation?

126
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:01,643
A whole garage full.

127
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:03,887
Tons of choices.
I'll take you there.

128
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,056
You want us to follow you,
you hand over your gun.

129
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,652
Really wanna spend time
with living people again,

130
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:12,654
but I'm not sure
I trust you, either.

131
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:14,656
I mean, I'm outnumbered.

132
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,558
I could probably take out
one of you,

133
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,185
two if I'm lucky.

134
00:06:18,187 --> 00:06:19,569
But then he'd still be left
to kill me anyways.

135
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:20,588
So why even try?

136
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,315
Unless I have a death wish,

137
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:24,908
which, clearly, I don't

138
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,501
because I have been living here
alone for so long.

139
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:27,511
See?

140
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:35,853
Fine. You can have it.

141
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:40,441
I know where to find
more guns, anyway.

142
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:43,611
So, then... the garage?

143
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:45,762
Right. Yeah. Of course.

144
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:48,115
All those in the market
for a new set of wheels,

145
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,341
follow me!

146
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,566
Selfish.

147
00:06:58,568 --> 00:06:59,743
And crazy.

148
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:29,973
<i>Wherrrre aaaaarrre theyyy...</i>

149
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:15,594
He's keeping
the cats away.

150
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,329
Mostly.

151
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:20,624
Your turn to watch.

152
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:24,286
How are you?

153
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:26,455
Everybody's counting on me.

154
00:08:26,457 --> 00:08:28,698
You'll come through.

155
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,177
- You think so?
- Yeah.

156
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,705
Hey, guys.

157
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:38,467
Uh, I need somebody
to run an errand for me.

158
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,063
I'll go.

159
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,640
Don't go home.

160
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:48,068
They'll only find us
if you answer me.

161
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,887
We got a plan to end this.

162
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:52,531
One I think you'd like.

163
00:08:55,393 --> 00:08:57,060
Man, being on the run
like this,

164
00:08:57,062 --> 00:08:59,972
barely scraping by...

165
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:04,309
reminds me
of the old gang.

166
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,495
Seems like ages now.

167
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:11,500
Michonne?

168
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:16,096
Can you hear me?

169
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,223
Michonne?

170
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:58,955
No sign of them.
They left quickly.

171
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:00,641
Couldn't have gone far.

172
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:03,644
Do we search elsewhere?

173
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,220
Where...

174
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:07,797
<i>They have nothinggggg...</i>

175
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,391
<i>Theyyyy fleeee...</i>

176
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:11,151
<i>theyyyy hiiiiide...</i>

177
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,395
Ocean.

178
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:51,341
Prepare the guardians.

179
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:53,343
We walk.

180
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:26,301
I thought
all the cats left.

181
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:28,478
Not this one.

182
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:32,649
I'm sorry about your mom.

183
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:39,698
You don't have to be.

184
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,912
You miss her?

185
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:47,397
No.

186
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:58,650
Not everyone gets to have
a mom like yours.

187
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,787
Hi.

188
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,196
Everything okay?

189
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:30,348
Yeah, running
to the road for Luke.

190
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,876
And give them
some exercise.

191
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:45,973
Judith.

192
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:47,790
- What're you doing?
- I'm fine.

193
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:49,217
Who you with?

194
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:50,185
No one.

195
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,795
Come on. We're going back.
Let's go.

196
00:12:52,797 --> 00:12:55,798
- Please, I wanna stay.
- No.

197
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,818
I left Father Gabriel
a note.

198
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,212
I swear, it's fine.

199
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,155
No, that wasn't a question.
Let's go.

200
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,774
No.

201
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:06,735
I hate it up there.

202
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:10,813
Smells like cat pee.

203
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:15,393
I wanna learn what you do,
how to keep us safe.

204
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,087
In case something happens.

205
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:23,159
I walk the perimeter.

206
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:25,012
I look for anything
that looks wrong.

207
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:26,921
If I find something,
I go somewhere safe,

208
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:29,516
and I radio it in.

209
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:33,020
There's no room for mistakes,
not right now.

210
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:34,563
I know.

211
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,673
All right.

212
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:38,933
If you do this with me,

213
00:13:38,935 --> 00:13:40,268
you're gonna do
everything I say,

214
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,603
you're gonna stay
right next to me.

215
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:42,887
All right?

216
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:43,938
Promise.

217
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,198
All right. Come on.

218
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,507
This is wrong.

219
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:08,446
They are not fools.

220
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:11,892
They expect us.

221
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:18,973
The path is not clear.

222
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:22,903
The pack believes
in your wisdom.

223
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,321
They follow the Alpha.

224
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,982
Beta, I mean.

225
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:29,484
Apologies.

226
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:30,652
We see her within you.

227
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,748
<i>Waaaaaaait.</i>

228
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:53,508
Show me.

229
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,328
Show me the path.

230
00:14:57,422 --> 00:15:00,348
<i>Patience...</i>

231
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:06,113
<i>Haaaave faith
in your strennnngth...</i>

232
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:09,341
<i>Watch...</i>

233
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:12,435
<i>Learnnnn...</i>

234
00:15:12,437 --> 00:15:15,347
We walk.

235
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:17,290
We wait.

236
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:45,986
Tower, do you copy?

237
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,213
<i>Yes, we copy.</i>

238
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:51,399
They're heading toward
Oceanside... as expected.

239
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:53,718
- <i>Any sign of slowing?</i>
- Not yet.

240
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,977
We'll stay on them.

241
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:56,571
If anything changes,
we'll send word.

242
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:58,406
<i>Copy that.
Be safe.</i>

243
00:15:58,408 --> 00:15:59,815
Same. Over.

244
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,175
How much longer
do you reckon?

245
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:09,734
Almost there.

246
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,569
If this is a waste
of our time...

247
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,722
It'll be worth it.
Don't worry!

248
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:18,593
Make sure you guys
stay close to me,

249
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:20,896
and please watch your step.

250
00:16:30,273 --> 00:16:31,865
<i>Tres...</i>

251
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:34,092
<i>Cuatro...</i>

252
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,285
<i>Cinco...</i>

253
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,204
Starting to wonder
if you were right about her.

254
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:57,115
Oh, I am.

255
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,267
But let's figure out
what she's up to first.

256
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:04,898
<i>Cincuenta y cuatro...</i>

257
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,307
<i>Cincuenta y cinco...</i>

258
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:08,068
Is there
a particular method

259
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,144
behind this
navigational technique,

260
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:12,113
or are you just
meandering about?

261
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,635
Holy crap.

262
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,162
I think I just
found your horse.

263
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:23,917
Did walkers eat it?

264
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,645
No, it probably just
stepped on one of the mines.

265
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:33,151
What do you particularly mean
by the term "mines"?

266
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,761
You know,
those things you step on

267
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:35,887
and then they go boom.

268
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,508
Are you saying you brought us
into a minefield?

269
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,585
Well, yeah.
But it... it's a small one.

270
00:17:42,587 --> 00:17:43,919
What's wrong with you?

271
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:45,921
Why would you keep that
from us?

272
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:47,265
I just didn't
want you to worry.

273
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:48,474
I told you
we couldn't trust her.

274
00:17:48,476 --> 00:17:49,943
I walk this all the time!

275
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:52,261
It's no big deal.
I got the route right up here.

276
00:17:52,263 --> 00:17:54,155
- So you can get us out?
- Of course.

277
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,782
As soon as I figure out
where we left off.

278
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,933
Excuse me?

279
00:17:57,935 --> 00:17:59,861
Well, I don't normally stop
in the middle,

280
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:02,013
so I kinda lost count.

281
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,364
I Just need a minute
to think.

282
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,374
Either you get us
out of here safely,

283
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,685
or I'll kill you
myself.

284
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:08,962
That's fair.

285
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:35,530
Ah. Guess not.

286
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:39,617
Anyone have
an extra canteen?

287
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,919
Damn it.

288
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:54,758
Almost have it.

289
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:10,264
Thanks.

290
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:11,649
You're welcome.

291
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:18,756
Thanks for coming.

292
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,683
You don't have to do that.

293
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:24,186
It's okay.

294
00:19:24,188 --> 00:19:25,580
No, it's not.

295
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:30,627
If I could go back...

296
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:35,197
I'm so sorry, Kelly,
for everything.

297
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:36,883
She's not dead.

298
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:42,538
She's not.

299
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,635
Maybe it's because
she's so... tough

300
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:50,355
to survive anything.

301
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,644
Maybe there's just
this part of me that...

302
00:19:56,646 --> 00:20:00,131
won't accept
that she's gone.

303
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,076
And, uh, so...

304
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:05,912
I understand you.

305
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,706
Why you did... all of it.

306
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,814
It doesn't mean
I should have.

307
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:24,322
When I started
losing my hearing...

308
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:28,584
my sister told me
that it wasn't my weakness.

309
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:31,438
It was my...

310
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,499
superpower.

311
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:43,933
And now look.

312
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:48,771
Everyone's learning sign
because of me.

313
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:52,959
You think that the way you are
is... is a weakness?

314
00:20:56,523 --> 00:21:00,616
I heard the stories about you,
in the old days.

315
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:02,527
We all have.

316
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:08,883
That you...
you'd just go off.

317
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:13,054
And do the thing
that only you can do.

318
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:18,042
Lone wolf.

319
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:21,062
That's your superpower.

320
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:24,899
You can't give up everything
about yourself because...

321
00:21:27,237 --> 00:21:30,571
...bad things happen.

322
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:33,891
I gotta believe that.

323
00:21:47,924 --> 00:21:49,407
Hey.

324
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,518
I, um...

325
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,078
I don't think you've eaten
anything today.

326
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,097
I'm good.

327
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:59,083
You know, I can't tell
if it's just one of those things

328
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:03,271
or the craziness of us all
moving to an abandoned tower...

329
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:05,281
or if you're just
avoiding me.

330
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:08,535
I'm avoiding you.

331
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:14,189
Well, shit, that...
that's honest.

332
00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:18,193
You want me to lie?

333
00:22:18,195 --> 00:22:19,796
Make you feel better?

334
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,050
No, I don't.

335
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,719
Okay. Well, you can give
someone else the rat stew.

336
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:31,132
It's not rat.
It's possum.

337
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:35,377
I mean, yeah, basically
a big rat, but I, um...

338
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:37,730
I just wanted to say...

339
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,290
that I liked her.

340
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:43,403
Your mom, I mean,
she did some horrible shit

341
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,630
that there's no excusing
any of it, but...

342
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,982
I liked...

343
00:22:47,984 --> 00:22:50,059
I liked a lot of things
about her.

344
00:22:50,061 --> 00:22:52,912
And I wish to God I didn't
have to do what I did.

345
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,147
But if there's something
that you wanna say to me,

346
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:57,625
then you should say it.

347
00:23:00,163 --> 00:23:01,880
Most of us wish
you'd died, too.

348
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,853
We never should
have followed her.

349
00:23:25,855 --> 00:23:27,505
This is exactly
the kind of thing

350
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:28,840
I was afraid
would happen.

351
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:33,453
I have been afraid
of many things.

352
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,437
But this one's new.

353
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:37,014
Just as an FYI,

354
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,274
we're running out of time
on multiple fronts.

355
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:43,296
Fence instability
being the most pressing.

356
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,373
But I'm also concerned
with improper mine placement,

357
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,674
which could lead
to a cascade.

358
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:47,759
What's a cascade?

359
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:53,789
Chain reaction.

360
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:55,224
You don't want to be
stuck in the middle

361
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,959
when more of these puppies
start popping off.

362
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:58,853
Maybe there's something
I can do.

363
00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:10,198
I'm kinda blowing this,
huh?

364
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,735
It's not ideal.

365
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:17,738
But leading us to safety
could go a long way.

366
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,240
Of course.

367
00:24:19,242 --> 00:24:22,484
I just wanna say
I didn't mean to.

368
00:24:22,486 --> 00:24:23,661
I'm sorry, y'know?

369
00:24:27,158 --> 00:24:29,083
Eeeny, meeny...

370
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:31,160
What is she doing now?

371
00:24:31,162 --> 00:24:32,845
...please no mine-ys...

372
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,472
Moe.

373
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:50,938
Whew!
I'm still here.

374
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,198
Cool.

375
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,409
We should be good
from here, guys.

376
00:25:14,205 --> 00:25:15,629
A hunter moves,

377
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:17,798
everything else
moves around it.

378
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,727
Try to spot things
that don't belong,

379
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:23,454
things that just don't
feel right.

380
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,023
Now take a look.

381
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,608
Tell me what you see.

382
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:37,034
Living or dead?

383
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:39,871
Walker.

384
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:44,233
They could be
roundin' more up.

385
00:25:44,235 --> 00:25:45,877
Stay behind me.

386
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:17,933
Come on.

387
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,685
Hey! You put our lives
in danger back there.

388
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:29,036
- For what?
- I didn't.

389
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:30,855
- Let's all just take a...
- No, no, no, no, no.

390
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:32,614
Our friends, our families,
are depending on us.

391
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:34,283
She may not have anyone
left to care about,

392
00:26:34,285 --> 00:26:35,468
but we sure as hell do.

393
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,785
I'm sorry.

394
00:26:36,787 --> 00:26:38,971
Fleetwood Drive.

395
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,365
What?

396
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:43,625
We passed Fleetwood Drive
earlier.

397
00:26:43,627 --> 00:26:45,294
Uh, must've been
a different Fleetwood.

398
00:26:45,296 --> 00:26:47,296
We've got like five of them
all over the city...

399
00:26:47,298 --> 00:26:50,041
streets, avenues, roads...
it's super confusing.

400
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:52,210
No, it was most certainly
Fleetwood Drive.

401
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:53,969
I remember seeing the sign
and saying to myself,

402
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:55,546
"Granddaddy used to drive
a Fleetwood."

403
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:58,140
You've led us
around all day

404
00:26:58,142 --> 00:27:00,051
when we could've
walked straight here?

405
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:01,268
Is that true?

406
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,662
Um...

407
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:05,647
- Yumiko...
- You better tell us what you're up to,

408
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:07,983
and maybe
I'll leave you here alive.

409
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:10,244
Okay, okay, okay.
I might've maybe sort of

410
00:27:10,246 --> 00:27:11,987
missed the turn
onto Fleetwood earlier

411
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:13,989
but only because I was
having too much fun!

412
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:16,008
And then I figured,
we could take the scenic route

413
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,402
instead of turning around
and keep the fun going!

414
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:21,347
- Into a minefield.
- Which looks bad... I know.

415
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:24,258
But I'd been through it
like a billion times before,

416
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,494
and I never thought
it was gonna to be a problem

417
00:27:26,496 --> 00:27:28,337
until it was.

418
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:30,523
All I wanted
was to show you the garage,

419
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:33,342
and then you'd be like,
"Princess, you're amazing!

420
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:35,920
We want to stay
and be friends!"

421
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:37,588
But, no...

422
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,440
I screwed it up.

423
00:27:39,442 --> 00:27:41,033
I see that now.

424
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,184
Yeah.

425
00:27:42,186 --> 00:27:44,095
Shit.

426
00:27:47,058 --> 00:27:48,616
When I was first here,
by myself,

427
00:27:48,618 --> 00:27:50,692
I figured somebody else
would show up eventually.

428
00:27:50,694 --> 00:27:51,936
Odds are, right?

429
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:53,621
And then days
turned into months.

430
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:57,032
And it was so empty.
But then I realized,

431
00:27:57,034 --> 00:27:58,217
this isn't that different

432
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,035
from how I felt
before all this.

433
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:05,207
This one time,
someone told me,

434
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:08,895
"You're hard to love."

435
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,212
So maybe it's me.

436
00:28:10,214 --> 00:28:11,805
Maybe I deserve this.

437
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:13,548
And all day,

438
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,568
I kept hearing that little voice
in my head...

439
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,886
"It's me."

440
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:21,574
And I know I should've...
turned around,

441
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:22,983
or told you guys the truth,

442
00:28:22,985 --> 00:28:24,535
but I didn't want that voice
to be right.

443
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:27,488
So...

444
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,307
I am sorry.

445
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:41,001
I have an all-too-familiar
sense of how you feel.

446
00:28:48,252 --> 00:28:51,011
I've made poor decisions.

447
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:53,847
Lied to folks.

448
00:28:53,849 --> 00:28:57,184
The inevitable alternative
meant being left alone.

449
00:28:57,186 --> 00:28:59,612
No one wants that.

450
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:01,906
Yeah.

451
00:29:05,528 --> 00:29:07,361
Just to clarify...

452
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:10,272
you do have access
to those wheels, correct?

453
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:34,054
Throw it over there.

454
00:29:34,056 --> 00:29:35,889
Now.

455
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:40,060
I will if you pull this
outta me.

456
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:42,637
I can't die like this.

457
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:44,306
It ain't natural.

458
00:29:44,308 --> 00:29:47,551
You drop the knife,
I'll think about it.

459
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:52,164
Where're your people?

460
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,149
A few miles east.

461
00:29:54,151 --> 00:29:56,985
Headed to the ocean.

462
00:29:56,987 --> 00:29:59,413
Are they with the horde?

463
00:29:59,415 --> 00:30:00,731
You a scout?

464
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:02,824
I was...

465
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:04,326
going off on my own.

466
00:30:04,328 --> 00:30:05,678
Why?

467
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,406
I had no choice.

468
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:12,184
I love those people,
but he's...

469
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:15,746
I couldn't stay there.

470
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:18,024
He's what?

471
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,750
Lost it.

472
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:22,920
After what you did
to her.

473
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:26,532
Will you take this out?

474
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:28,776
Does he know where we are?

475
00:30:28,778 --> 00:30:33,264
I don't know.

476
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:35,690
But he's gonna keep
coming for you.

477
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:38,786
You took too much.

478
00:30:38,788 --> 00:30:40,621
No, please.

479
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:42,940
Please.

480
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:45,217
I want to walk... after.

481
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,920
Does he know
where we are?

482
00:30:47,922 --> 00:30:50,130
I don't know.

483
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:52,049
I mean it.

484
00:31:08,225 --> 00:31:10,467
You didn't have to do that.

485
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:14,471
She didn't have any information
for us, anyway.

486
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,307
She was gonna die.

487
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:18,751
Better to be quick.

488
00:31:20,904 --> 00:31:21,979
We're gonna leave her?

489
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,006
Come on.

490
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:27,343
Maybe she has a family.

491
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:33,340
Look, if they're only
a few miles away,

492
00:31:33,342 --> 00:31:35,893
maybe we can spot something
from the top of the tower.

493
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:46,337
Faith. Faith.

494
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:50,841
Faith. Watch.

495
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:52,934
Learn.

496
00:31:52,936 --> 00:31:58,940
<i>Theyyy fleeee
beforrre youuuu...</i>

497
00:31:58,942 --> 00:32:01,627
Strength...

498
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:03,687
Strength...

499
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:11,779
<i>Waaaaatch...</i>

500
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:18,552
Faaaaith.

501
00:32:18,554 --> 00:32:20,813
<i>Yesssssss...</i>

502
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:22,815
<i>Faaaaaaith...</i>

503
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:28,136
<i>will beeeee rewarrrrrded...</i>

504
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,739
Still no sign of slowing?

505
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:40,741
You think this can work?

506
00:32:40,743 --> 00:32:42,559
This plan?

507
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:45,004
Has to, doesn't it?

508
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:46,672
I guess so.

509
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
Always thought,

510
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:54,663
once Alpha was dead...

511
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:56,757
it'd be easier
to see light.

512
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:59,000
Past what we lost,
y'know?

513
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:02,413
I don't know about
seeing past.

514
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:04,857
But I can fight here,

515
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,584
try to make sure
we don't lose again.

516
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:10,604
For Gracie, Adam.

517
00:33:10,606 --> 00:33:12,847
Whatever it takes.

518
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,518
Then, all this loss will maybe
add up to something...

519
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,537
Hold on.
Are they slowing down?

520
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:24,284
No.

521
00:33:24,286 --> 00:33:26,027
- They're changing direction.
- Toward the tower.

522
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:27,379
- Call it in.
- Yeah.

523
00:33:32,628 --> 00:33:35,036
It's no good.

524
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:37,614
We got to leave... now.

525
00:33:55,483 --> 00:33:58,202
You don't get to tell me
what to do.

526
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:01,730
You're right. I can't.

527
00:34:01,732 --> 00:34:04,566
Hey.

528
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:06,401
I think
that you should hit me.

529
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:07,878
And it will make you
feel better.

530
00:34:09,331 --> 00:34:11,164
I feel fine.

531
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:13,592
You have to mourn her.

532
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:15,744
You know,
you need to say goodbye.

533
00:34:15,746 --> 00:34:18,013
Otherwise, it's gonna
eat you up from the insides.

534
00:34:19,675 --> 00:34:21,992
Just...
Just trust me on this.

535
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:25,920
Look,
she was still your mom.

536
00:34:25,922 --> 00:34:29,182
You know?
And we only get the one.

537
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:32,169
So you...
you should hit me...

538
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:35,856
and just try
to let it out.

539
00:34:35,858 --> 00:34:38,358
Otherwise, you are gonna drift
further from these people,

540
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,119
and I know
you don't want that.

541
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,087
The hell do you know
what I want, huh?

542
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:43,847
Tell me.

543
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,533
You're a selfish asshole.

544
00:34:46,535 --> 00:34:48,018
You only killed her

545
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,429
so they'd think
that you're a hero.

546
00:34:50,431 --> 00:34:53,098
But nothing you do will ever
make you that here!

547
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,949
Because you only care
about yourself.

548
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:58,804
Even now,
trying to get me to do this?

549
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:00,622
You liked her?

550
00:35:00,624 --> 00:35:03,642
How the hell can you tell me
you liked her, huh?!

551
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:05,218
I hated her!

552
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,812
I want to hate her,

553
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:10,040
so screw you for telling me
I can't even do that!

554
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:11,875
It's okay, Lydia.

555
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:13,134
No!

556
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:14,878
It's not okay!

557
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,547
It's not okay!

558
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:18,139
It's not okay!

559
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:20,217
It's not... not...

560
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:28,392
It's okay.

561
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,305
It's okay.

562
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,334
Wheels.

563
00:35:46,336 --> 00:35:49,079
Yeah.

564
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:52,265
Not exactly the kind of ride
I was picturing, but...

565
00:35:52,267 --> 00:35:54,084
15 miles per hour
is a significant increase

566
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:56,086
over walking.

567
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:02,826
To be fair, she wasn't
lying about the garage.

568
00:36:05,614 --> 00:36:07,664
She came through.

569
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,937
Oh, man.

570
00:36:16,032 --> 00:36:19,218
- Listen, I...
- I'm not a bad person.

571
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,961
I want you to know that.

572
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:24,948
And you had every reason
not to trust me.

573
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,284
It's so hard to take a chance
on people in this world.

574
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:29,786
And when those people
lie to you, well ...-

575
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,622
Yeah. I know.

576
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:33,290
It sucks.

577
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,808
I blew it.

578
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,810
I know.

579
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:38,720
And I'm sorry.

580
00:36:38,722 --> 00:36:40,388
I guess...

581
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,965
I wish I had
done things better,

582
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,893
but I guess my people skills
are pretty rusty.

583
00:36:44,895 --> 00:36:47,487
Well, that's something we're
gonna have to work on, then.

584
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:52,142
I was coming over here to see
if you wanted to join us.

585
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,650
Wait. For real?

586
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:02,319
Yeah, as long as you don't
lie to us again, okay?

587
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:03,503
Yes.

588
00:37:03,505 --> 00:37:06,414
Yes, yes, yes!

589
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:07,641
- Yes, yes!
- Oh, okay.

590
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,626
Well,
you know the area, so...

591
00:37:11,421 --> 00:37:13,588
Do we have enough time to grab
stuff from my stash?

592
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,074
I-I-I've got food
and clothes

593
00:37:16,076 --> 00:37:18,669
and a cool spear
and some candy.

594
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:20,420
Does this mean
I get to have my gun back?

595
00:37:20,422 --> 00:37:22,096
Can I know
where we're going?

596
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:24,575
Is there a map?
Do I get to hold it?

597
00:37:35,946 --> 00:37:38,964
What is it?

598
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:41,708
I can't believe
we just left her.

599
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,594
In a ditch.

600
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:50,367
What if you were lost...

601
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,811
and no one could find you?

602
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:55,814
Or RJ was.

603
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:58,025
Or Mom.

604
00:37:59,712 --> 00:38:02,613
You gotta tell me
where this is coming from.

605
00:38:04,508 --> 00:38:08,719
I just want us to be
back together again.

606
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:10,220
At home.

607
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:12,331
That's all.

608
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,241
I radioed your mom

609
00:38:14,243 --> 00:38:17,002
so she knows not to go home,
so she's safe.

610
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:18,820
And that way,
she can find us.

611
00:38:18,822 --> 00:38:20,397
You talked to her?

612
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,307
No.

613
00:38:22,309 --> 00:38:24,751
But I'm gonna
keep trying.

614
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:30,182
It doesn't matter.

615
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:35,762
I talked to her
after the fire.

616
00:38:35,764 --> 00:38:37,748
And I'm worried...

617
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,842
maybe she won't
come home.

618
00:38:42,254 --> 00:38:45,922
What'd she say?

619
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:49,109
She went to go help
some people she met.

620
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:52,779
Who needed her.

621
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:54,447
I didn't wanna tell you.

622
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:56,433
Why's that?

623
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:03,348
'Cause maybe
you'd leave, too.

624
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,367
I won't.

625
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:08,461
You promise?

626
00:39:08,463 --> 00:39:11,039
I can't.

627
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:14,801
- Why?
- Because I can't lie to you.

628
00:39:14,803 --> 00:39:17,804
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

629
00:39:17,806 --> 00:39:19,806
And there ain't no one
that can tell you that they do.

630
00:39:21,977 --> 00:39:24,795
And there's one thing
I know.

631
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:26,146
There's a whole bunch of people
back there

632
00:39:26,148 --> 00:39:28,648
that'd do anything
for you.

633
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,409
And one day,
when you're older,

634
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:33,561
they're gonna need you to do
anything for them.

635
00:39:33,563 --> 00:39:35,730
You got
a whole lot of family.

636
00:39:46,835 --> 00:39:50,762
Nothing can take the place of
someone you love being gone.

637
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,839
But that doesn't mean
that everything that follows

638
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:54,766
is gonna break your heart.

639
00:40:08,523 --> 00:40:10,023
Hey.

640
00:40:10,025 --> 00:40:12,009
We gotta go, kiddo,
all right?

641
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:13,193
Come on.

642
00:40:15,697 --> 00:40:17,364
Gabriel?

643
00:40:17,366 --> 00:40:19,774
<i>Daryl...
where are you?</i>

644
00:40:19,776 --> 00:40:21,034
You're breaking up.
I can't hear you.

645
00:40:21,036 --> 00:40:22,202
Come back...

646
00:40:22,204 --> 00:40:23,536
they've...
surrounded the...

647
00:40:23,538 --> 00:40:24,855
Gabriel?

648
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:27,281
- <i>We need... wagon...</i>
- Gabriel!

649
00:40:45,894 --> 00:40:48,987
Faith.

650
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:51,639
Faaaaith...

651
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:54,551
Reward.

652
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:58,163
Rewaaaaaaaaard...

653
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:12,549

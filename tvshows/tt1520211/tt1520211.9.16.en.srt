1
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:13,796
Finally broke.

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,104
And we can't fix it.

3
00:00:19,889 --> 00:00:22,892
I kept trying to hold on.

4
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:26,026
We did.

5
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:31,596
But things fall apart.

6
00:00:37,428 --> 00:00:38,995
The cold set in.

7
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:42,085
Fires raged.

8
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:45,349
The rot spread.

9
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:53,531
It's knowing
when to keep fighting

10
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:56,969
and knowing when it's over.

11
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:06,327
If only for now.

12
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,247
We need help.

13
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,252
Shelter.

14
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,733
From the storms to come.

15
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:23,953
Make sure you eat something.

16
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:26,999
We gotta get these folks
to Hilltop.

17
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,969
But we'll never forget

18
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:42,450
the magic we felt in this place.

19
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,899
The love.

20
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:24,144
The acts of courage.

21
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:29,453
Cowards die many times
before their deaths.

22
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:40,464
The valiant never
taste of death but once.

23
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,212
They were the valiant.

24
00:03:57,062 --> 00:04:00,065
As we head into
an uncertain future,

25
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,417
we must be valiant, too...

26
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,419
All of us.

27
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,509
Together.

28
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:15,445
No one can agree on
what to do next.

29
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:18,492
And the Council cannot come
to any security resolutions?

30
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,496
Everyone's still reeling,

31
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,542
between Jesus, Tara,
and the others we lost.

32
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:28,240
And still nothing from Maggie.

33
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:29,894
The Council sent another letter,

34
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:32,941
but... we haven't heard
anything back.

35
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:35,726
Well...

36
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,745
Is that them?

37
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:57,357
People watching us now,

38
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:01,839
Well, we followed their rules.

39
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:03,624
Haven't they done enough to us?

40
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,321
Hey.

41
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,541
Why don't you lay off.

42
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:16,027
You don't have to protect me.

43
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,203
I know how they feel about me.

44
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:21,250
No. Don't mean they get
to talk to you like that.

45
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:26,995
Just I don't want to cause
any more problems.

46
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:33,305
It's their problem, not yours.

47
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:08,210
Henry wanted her here.

48
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:11,169
When no one else did.

49
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:16,392
She's a good kid.

50
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,439
Every time I look at her,
all I see is him.

51
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:27,142
Who do you see
when you look at me?

52
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:33,191
I see you.

53
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:38,936
Hey, boss?

54
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,983
Barometer's taking a nosedive.

55
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:45,247
We've got a mother of a storm
coming.

56
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,641
We'll have to travel
through the night

57
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:49,357
if we have any hope of making it
to the next way station

58
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:50,600
before it hits.

59
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,048
They're both dead.

60
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:06,616
Well...

61
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:10,315
We could keep each other warm.

62
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,883
The peanut's listening.

63
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:16,626
I did the systems check

64
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,498
on the state of the array,
as requested,

65
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,543
and the solar panels
are no bueno.

66
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,632
Best bet is to go old school
to keep toasty.

67
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:25,635
I'd advise initiating
winter one ice-storm protocol.

68
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:31,598
The meeting room,
Aaron's house, and Barbara's

69
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:32,923
have the largest
working fireplaces.

70
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:34,209
We'll divide into those.

71
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:35,602
I'll get the word out.

72
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,212
We'll gather up
dry firewood, stock up,

73
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:38,343
get cozy, and ride it out.

74
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,694
We can't leave Negan.

75
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:44,567
He'll freeze down there.

76
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,266
We have to let him out.

77
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:26,827
Keep going.

78
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,393
We'll catch up.

79
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:05,648
You given much thought to
your plans after this?

80
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:06,649
No, unh-unh.

81
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:08,042
Why?

82
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:09,609
The past few months

83
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:12,524
have been difficult
for Carol and I.

84
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:15,702
I'm hoping for a fresh start
with her at Hilltop,

85
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:18,661
and it'd be easier
if it was just us.

86
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:23,710
You think
that's what Carol wants?

87
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:26,495
Carol wants the same thing I do.

88
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,540
To hold our son again.

89
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,373
Shit.

90
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:38,420
I'm not trying to be
a bad guy here, man.

91
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:41,684
I just want to get back
a piece of what I lost.

92
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:43,904
What we lost.

93
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:50,084
After everything,

94
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:53,130
you think you could
give me that?

95
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,300
Weather's already kicking in.

96
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:45,781
Even if we hauled ass overnight,
we'd never make it.

97
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,174
We need to get off the roads,

98
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:49,567
find shelter between here
and the next way station.

99
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:54,050
You have a place in mind?

100
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:55,356
Yeah.

101
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:07,542
People actually lived here?

102
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:10,588
Welcome to the Sanctuary.

103
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:23,297
I swear to God,

104
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,343
I have memorized
every square inch of this room.

105
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:33,002
And it still feels like a party.

106
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,833
A never-ending party from hell.

107
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:40,053
I mean, sure, all right.

108
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:42,620
It smells like
a goddamn barn in here,

109
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:44,144
all bored shitless, but...

110
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:45,536
Language!

111
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,277
Sorry.

112
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:48,975
Sorry, kiddo.

113
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:50,933
But, I mean, we've got ourselves

114
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,936
this hot little
love quadrangle here

115
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,938
to entertain us.

116
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:58,114
It's like Christmas to me.

117
00:14:58,158 --> 00:14:59,942
Well, maybe
they're just as miserable

118
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,248
at Aaron's or Barbara's.

119
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,905
Gabe, your girl's doc

120
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:09,256
is also your girl's baby daddy,

121
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:11,388
which kind of
begs the question...

122
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:12,694
Do you ever wonder

123
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:14,652
what the hell
was going on in there

124
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:16,654
when she has her "appointments"?

125
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:20,136
You could try to be
a little less predictable.

126
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:23,618
That hurts, Gabe, truly.

127
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,750
You know,
we're all grown-ups here.

128
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,970
And none of us
would ever let that ruin

129
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:30,973
the longstanding friendships
and mutual respect we have.

130
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:34,803
You know what? You're right.

131
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:37,849
That is a very mature attitude,
Father "Not The Father."

132
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,550
Ha!

133
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:45,596
Is that unpredictable enough
for you?

134
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:50,993
Jude, don't sit so close
to the window.

135
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:59,132
Hey, kiddo, you still
worried about that mutt?

136
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:00,413
Daryl told me
to take care of him

137
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:03,353
while he helped the Kingdom
move to Hilltop.

138
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,575
I don't know where he is.

139
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:14,103
Does anybody else
smell something?

140
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:15,887
Can you stop being
such an asshole?

141
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,150
No, he's right.

142
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:19,021
Something does
smell funky in here.

143
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,460
Get away from there.

144
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:33,253
As I suspected.

145
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:35,211
The chimney flue
is completely gunkified.

146
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:36,996
What singed
your nostrils earlier

147
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,737
was no doubt a toxic mixture
of creosote and H2O.

148
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:46,242
Blizzard's done
some tearing and blaring.

149
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:47,895
And our chimney's
ventilation capabilities

150
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,182
are nil to none.

151
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:51,140
It'd be unwise
to spark up another blaze

152
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:53,882
lest we plan on ceasing
all respiratory functions,

153
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:56,058
a.k.a. smoking and choking.

154
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:59,105
God, I missed you, Eugene.

155
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,324
I can't say the same.

156
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:12,944
You know, without a fire,

157
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:15,295
we'll never get these people
warm enough.

158
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,340
Yeah, we should leave

159
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:18,796
before the temperature
drops any lower.

160
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:23,259
Okay, folks, contingency plan.

161
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:26,001
We're going to Aaron's house.

162
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,048
It'll be tight quarters,
but we'll make it work.

163
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:39,275
Seriously?

164
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,193
Not one of you assholes
is gonna untie me?

165
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:47,718
We could tell Michonne
it was an accident.

166
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:56,510
Okay, okay.

167
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:44,340
You okay?

168
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,130
Yeah.

169
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:56,222
We're gonna make it.

170
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:57,745
All right?

171
00:18:57,788 --> 00:18:59,138
We will.

172
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,096
Yeah.

173
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,494
Something happened back there
with you and Ezekiel?

174
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:09,148
No.

175
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:17,852
He only blames you

176
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:20,855
because he can't let himself
blame me.

177
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:31,039
I feel like
I'm losing myself again.

178
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,567
I'm really trying to hang on,

179
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:40,135
but I don't...

180
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,006
I don't know what I'm doing.

181
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:55,411
I could take her away from here.

182
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:58,022
I can keep her safe on my own.

183
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:00,416
You want to go?

184
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,377
No.

185
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:09,991
No, I don't.

186
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:13,255
What do you want me to do?

187
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:24,875
The snow's never hit this hard
this early.

188
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:27,356
Yeah.

189
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,490
It could last for days,
but we can't.

190
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:31,273
Not here.

191
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:33,188
We don't have enough.

192
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,668
Maybe if I head
to the way station,

193
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:35,712
bring back supplies.

194
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,975
Yeah, I thought of that, too.

195
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:39,803
But we might get
caught out there in this

196
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:41,892
and leave them worse off.

197
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:44,939
Let me see your map.

198
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,810
The next way station is here,

199
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:48,159
right across the river

200
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:49,944
that runs alongside
the old route B.

201
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:51,467
I thought the only crossing

202
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:53,271
was back along
the route we were on. Aaron It is.

203
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,446
There's no way we'll make it,

204
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,864
not in these conditions.

205
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,387
Rick's bridge would've saved us.

206
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:00,147
It could've cut half a day
off our travel time.

207
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:02,739
But we don't need a bridge.

208
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:04,350
The creeks and ponds
are frozen over.

209
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:06,439
As long as we don't
all go at once,

210
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,789
we could probably
just walk across.

211
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:11,444
There, through
our old hunting grounds.

212
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:12,706
It's a straight shot.

213
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:15,099
A straight shot through
Alpha's territory.

214
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:18,407
We didn't agree
to those borders.

215
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:21,192
Those borders are hers,
not ours.

216
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:24,065
That's cold comfort
if we trigger a war.

217
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:25,651
We don't even know
how to fight them yet.

218
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:27,416
It's only a couple miles...

219
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,524
Hey, we can cross at night.

220
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:30,289
They won't know
that we're there.

221
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:31,855
What if they already know?

222
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:33,964
They could've been watching us
in that field back there.

223
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:36,164
It's all the more reason
to move now.

224
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:38,862
We can do this.

225
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:39,950
With the elderly?

226
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:41,648
With the children?

227
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:44,390
We can't take horses and wagons
across the ice.

228
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:45,541
Then we'll have to go by foot.

229
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:48,219
Yes, it's risky,

230
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:50,134
but we're only carrying
enough food

231
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:51,875
to last us another day or two,

232
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,616
and this storm
could dump enough snow

233
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,402
to make these roads
impassable for weeks.

234
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:58,795
It's either we make it
to the next way station

235
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,536
or we die.

236
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:25,909
I'm sorry.

237
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:28,956
I wish there was another way.

238
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:32,220
I just want to do right by them.

239
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:37,138
The Kingdom fell.

240
00:22:37,747 --> 00:22:40,750
I should've seen it coming,
gotten us out sooner.

241
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:43,642
My people
wouldn't be here like this

242
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,015
if it wasn't for me.

243
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,844
No, they wouldn't be.

244
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:50,891
'Cause they wouldn't be here
at all.

245
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:57,376
All this time we spent apart...

246
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:02,772
I thought it made us stronger.

247
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:06,559
It didn't.

248
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:09,562
That... woman...

249
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:12,216
was able to walk amongst us

250
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,263
because we didn't know
each other.

251
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:21,443
We can never
let that happen again.

252
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,233
And we've come too far
to give up.

253
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:32,236
The Kingdom hasn't fallen.

254
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,238
It's right here.

255
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:37,285
And that charter we signed,
it means something.

256
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,854
It means that these people
aren't just yours anymore.

257
00:23:40,897 --> 00:23:43,117
They're ours.

258
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,466
And we're gonna get them home.

259
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,773
If they see us
crossing that border,

260
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:48,470
it could start something.

261
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:53,127
So we make sure that they don't.

262
00:25:30,703 --> 00:25:33,706
Dog!

263
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:35,577
Wait!

264
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:37,927
Dog! No!

265
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:39,755
Judith!

266
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:42,628
Judith!

267
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:44,760
No!

268
00:25:44,804 --> 00:25:45,892
Negan!

269
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:47,284
Do not let go!

270
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:48,416
Judith!

271
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:50,853
Keep going! Hold the rope!

272
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:52,812
Judith!

273
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,343
There's the river. We made it.

274
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:33,564
I'm gonna check the ice.

275
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:34,957
I'm right behind you.

276
00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:58,764
Yeah, I think we're good.

277
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:12,952
We have to assume they have eyes
on the borders.

278
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:15,824
Make sure the others
are ready to go.

279
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:17,521
Done and done.

280
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:24,354
Hey, where's Lydia?

281
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:25,747
I'm gonna go find her.

282
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,183
You get everyone across.

283
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:29,185
I'll be right back.

284
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:31,013
All right, let's move.

285
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:36,976
Hey!

286
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:55,429
Move!

287
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:01,391
Come on!

288
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:06,919
Come on!

289
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:24,850
Come on. Let's go.

290
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:26,765
Let's go. Let's get off this.

291
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,592
- One at a time!
- Nice and easy.

292
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:30,246
Nice and easy.
Not too many at once.

293
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,988
- Come on.
- Come on. Here we go.

294
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:34,468
- Watch it.
- There. There.

295
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,385
Daryl, incoming.

296
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:39,908
- Keep moving.
- One at a time.

297
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:41,190
We got to get across
to the other side now!

298
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:43,054
- Not too much weight on the ice.
- Stay alert!

299
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,830
- Stay together.
- Come on, come on.

300
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:50,963
Hold up. Not too many at once.

301
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:52,006
Not too many at once.

302
00:29:58,448 --> 00:29:59,928
Is it them?

303
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:02,017
No.

304
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:02,975
Not here.

305
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:05,455
Not in this.

306
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:13,115
Get them across.
We'll hold 'em back.

307
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,162
- Come on.
- Come on.

308
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:42,797
What the hell are you doing?

309
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,061
I don't know.

310
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,022
I just know
I can't cross that river.

311
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:51,675
Why not?

312
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,808
Because I know
what's on the other side.

313
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,899
It's the same thing
that's on this side.

314
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:00,051
Everyone's acting like
getting to Hilltop's

315
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:03,078
gonna make
all our problems go away,

316
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:04,926
like it's gonna make
everything better,

317
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,082
but it's not gonna change shit.

318
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:13,915
They're not gonna want me back.

319
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:15,830
If they hadn't taken me in
to begin with,

320
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,963
all those people
would still be alive.

321
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:23,969
Your son's dead 'cause of me.

322
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:32,499
Henry said I was a...
A good person.

323
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:34,631
But he was wrong.

324
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:37,678
As long as I'm one of you,
it's never gonna stop.

325
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,422
You know I'm right.

326
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:47,949
There's only one way
to fix this.

327
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:54,521
You see it.

328
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:56,088
It can be you.

329
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:00,353
No one else has to know.

330
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,741
Please, Carol,

331
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:43,004
everything's gonna be better
when I'm gone.

332
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,106
This is how you keep
from losing anyone else.

333
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:08,334
Please, Carol.

334
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:11,076
Please, just do it.

335
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,165
Do it for Henry.

336
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,518
I'm sorry it has to be you,

337
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,433
but it does.

338
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:23,479
I'm too weak.

339
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:26,047
Just like my mother said.

340
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:48,591
You're not weak.

341
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:52,595
Come on. We have to go.

342
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:57,339
Come on.

343
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:05,260
Judith!

344
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:06,522
Judith!

345
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:08,263
Judith!

346
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:11,049
Judith!

347
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:15,096
Judith!

348
00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:21,276
Aah!

349
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:23,931
Goddammit!

350
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:26,847
Judith!

351
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,240
Judith!

352
00:34:32,548 --> 00:34:34,985
Judith!

353
00:34:40,252 --> 00:34:43,124
Judith!

354
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:53,178
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

355
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:55,615
Okay.

356
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:58,661
I gotcha, I gotcha.

357
00:35:31,738 --> 00:35:34,828
Hey, hey, hey.

358
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:36,177
You okay?

359
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:37,918
I'm okay.

360
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,360
Here you go.

361
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:47,449
You know, I know why
you're doing this.

362
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:50,583
You're just trying to get
a little extra Negan time,

363
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:52,324
aren't you?

364
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:54,761
Can I tell you something, kid?

365
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:56,371
That dog,

366
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:58,808
he better poop
little golden nuggets.

367
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:01,855
You know what I'm saying?

368
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:08,122
Your leg looks like shit.

369
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,169
Language, Miss Grimes.

370
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:16,391
You noticed?

371
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:19,177
It doesn't feel great,
to tell you the truth.

372
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:23,137
It'll be all right.

373
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:27,794
I'm real glad I found you.

374
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:32,842
Okay, kiddo, we gotta
get out of this weather.

375
00:36:32,886 --> 00:36:35,976
All right?

376
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,897
Okay.

377
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,986
Dog, too. What?

378
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:47,248
We have to get him back.

379
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:48,684
The dog.

380
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:50,817
Okay. All right.

381
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,775
All right.

382
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:54,429
Come on, Dog.

383
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:47,221
It's like our new Kingdom,
only it's Hilltop.

384
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:48,831
Hey, if we call it "Kingtop,"

385
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,920
maybe we could
make that a thing.

386
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:56,317
You should try
to get some sleep.

387
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:59,320
We're gonna head to Alexandria
in the morning.

388
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:00,408
Okay.

389
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:03,716
Seems nice there.

390
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:06,066
Yeah, it is.

391
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:08,460
Why'd you leave?

392
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:13,378
One day.

393
00:38:13,943 --> 00:38:15,336
Try to get some sleep.

394
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,961
We made it.

395
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:38,054
Did we?

396
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:45,845
I'm going to Alexandria tomorrow
with the others.

397
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:52,417
I know you have to do this.

398
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:01,251
But I will never stop
loving you.

399
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,346
And I'll never regret
the fairy tale.

400
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:43,555
Hi!

401
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:47,602
How are you?

402
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:49,996
Are you good?

403
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,127
What happened?

404
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:53,173
It's cold.

405
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:10,538
Hey. R.J.

406
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:48,054
All right.

407
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:51,623
Well, look who's here.

408
00:40:58,412 --> 00:41:01,415
Thank you. For saving her.

409
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:07,421
You always did have
a flair for the dramatic.

410
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:11,251
Well, last time
we were here together,

411
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:13,949
Rick had just
slit my throat open.

412
00:41:13,993 --> 00:41:16,430
So this...

413
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,477
Hell, this ain't nothin'.

414
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:23,263
She's a special girl.

415
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:25,918
A damn spitfire.

416
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:28,964
And you...

417
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:32,490
You've been through enough.

418
00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:39,279
Get better.

419
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:40,976
You know, Dr. Babydaddy said

420
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,978
that you got caught in the storm

421
00:41:43,022 --> 00:41:46,112
with the Royalty Brigade.

422
00:41:46,155 --> 00:41:48,157
Is everyone okay?

423
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:55,251
Do you care?

424
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:59,517
Look, I don't know
any of those people from Adam.

425
00:42:01,214 --> 00:42:03,608
I do know what it's like
to lose a kingdom,

426
00:42:03,651 --> 00:42:06,262
see things fall apart.

427
00:42:06,306 --> 00:42:08,351
And it sucks ass.

428
00:42:08,395 --> 00:42:11,398
The Sanctuary's a shithole now.

429
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:14,836
Well, hell,
I could've told you that.

430
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,621
All you had to do was ask.

431
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,843
So, you cut through
their territory.

432
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:25,847
Ballsy.

433
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:39,861
We don't even know
if they were there.

434
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:43,256
The point is, we came together,

435
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:46,302
and we made it.

436
00:42:47,303 --> 00:42:49,784
Common enemy, common goal.

437
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:52,570
Or facing evil brings
good people together.

438
00:42:53,832 --> 00:42:56,617
Same thing.

439
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:59,533
It's just that
no one ever thinks

440
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,318
that they're the evil one.

441
00:43:23,383 --> 00:43:26,386
The time away
has been good for the pack.

442
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,172
And for you.

443
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:36,657
It has.

444
00:43:39,225 --> 00:43:41,531
But I've made mistakes...

445
00:43:41,575 --> 00:43:44,273
Mistakes I can't make again.

446
00:43:44,317 --> 00:43:46,972
And you won't.

447
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:48,626
You're strong.

448
00:43:51,498 --> 00:43:54,501
I'll need to be stronger
for what comes next.

449
00:43:57,939 --> 00:44:00,246
You will be.

450
00:44:31,843 --> 00:44:34,846
We'll come back from this.

451
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:37,979
Being here at Hilltop,

452
00:44:38,023 --> 00:44:41,026
amongst our family's a start.

453
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:45,683
We'll make it through
this winter of our discontent.

454
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:48,686
When the snow melts
and the winds quiet,

455
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:52,864
who knows what glorious summer
may bring.

456
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:57,129
Maybe you can even go back home
to the Kingdom someday.

457
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,786
Just because we left our house

458
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:04,832
doesn't mean we lost our home.

459
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:06,529
Roger that.

460
00:45:06,573 --> 00:45:08,880
I have to go do my homework now.

461
00:45:08,923 --> 00:45:11,143
I'll tell my mom you said hello.

462
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:13,798
Over and out.

463
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:15,277
Over and out.

464
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,913
Hello? Hello?

465
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:45,568
Calling out live
on the open air.

466
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:47,657
Is anybody out there?

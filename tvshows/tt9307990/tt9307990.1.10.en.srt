He threatened to take me outside.

1283
01:08:12,561 --> 01:08:14,697
Okay. So is there a place on a map

1284
01:08:14,731 --> 01:08:15,864
that Camden is afraid of?

1285
01:08:15,889 --> 01:08:18,435
Kid had no fear until the Bone
Collector came into our lives.

1286
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:20,037
The minute he saw his father

1287
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:22,271
chasing a serial killer
all over New York...

1288
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:24,908
Maybe it's that... the kills.
We know where those are.

1289
01:08:24,943 --> 01:08:26,287
Yeah. I can mark them off on the map.

1290
01:08:26,322 --> 01:08:28,421
I don't need them marked
to know where they are.

1291
01:08:29,506 --> 01:08:31,074
Give me a minute.

1292
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:47,564
I have seen Camden afraid:

1293
01:08:47,599 --> 01:08:50,167
when he came to the hospital
and saw me this way.

1294
01:08:50,201 --> 01:08:52,636
- What hospital?
- Not the hospital.

1295
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,204
Pull up the warehouse
where he did this to me.

1296
01:08:57,908 --> 01:08:59,775
- It should be right there.
- He erased it.

1297
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:01,478
Well, the clue wasn't what is on the map.

1298
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,456
It's what's not there.

1299
01:09:04,748 --> 01:09:07,167
He wants to take me back
to where this started.

1300
01:09:08,653 --> 01:09:10,020
That's where it ends.

1301
01:09:10,054 --> 01:09:13,090
- I'll call ESU.
- No. I have to go alone.

1302
01:09:13,123 --> 01:09:15,591
- You know that's a trap.
- Of course it's a trap.

I don't tell you how to do your job,

1379
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,550
that Sabin Baldridge was our man,

1380
01:13:05,585 --> 01:13:09,426
but you pushed right by me

1381
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,194
I'm hacking the remote.

1382
01:13:11,229 --> 01:13:13,095

I wanted to show how valuable I was,

1386
01:13:25,126 --> 01:13:31,264
but instead...
I got cut from the Academy.

1387
01:13:31,288 --> 01:13:33,511
The program was designed
to weed out students!

1388

We all knew that.

1389
01:13:34,909 --> 01:13:37,345

Sabin Baldridge first,

1390
01:13:37,369 --> 01:13:39,393
I wouldn't have been head of the class?

1391
01:13:39,427 --> 01:13:41,725
No, because if you had it in you,

01:13:41,759 --> 01:13:44,127
you would've gotten
the answer before I did.

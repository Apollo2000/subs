1
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:06,571
male narrator: Previously,
on "Lincoln Rhyme"...

2
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:07,877
- What is the Bone Collector

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,487
trying to tell us
about each new murder?

4
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:11,054
- Jane wanted to come by
and say hi.

5
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:13,100
She is fascinated
by what you do.

6
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:14,449
- You're not a very
nice person, Jane.

7
00:00:14,492 --> 00:00:16,407
You were a good friend
to Danielle.

8
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:20,063
But all good things
must come to an end.

9
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:21,195
- Our breaking story,

10
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:23,240
the return
of the Bone Collector.

11
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:25,112
- We beat the Bone Collector
at his game.

12
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:27,505
We're going to play
a new game.

13
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:31,248
So let me address
the Bone Collector directly

14
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:33,294
if he's watching.

15
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:36,514
For eight years,
we let you set the rules.

16
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:38,429
But now we're done.

17
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:41,650
We have a new game
with new rules.

18
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:45,088
And all you need to know is,
we're coming for you,

19
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:48,135
and we will find you.

20
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:50,702
We're coming for you,
and we will find you.

21
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:54,706
We're coming for you,
and we will find you.

22
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,101
We're coming for you,
and we will find you.

23
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:02,453
- Hey.
- Hey.

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,677
- Everything okay?
- I'm fine. Everything's fine.

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,420
- I got some coffee
and croissants.

26
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:13,812
- I'm not hungry.

27
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:15,379
- Okay, now I know
something's wrong.

28
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:18,382
- I told you, I'm fine.

29
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:23,474
A lot of things on my mind.

30
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:26,825
- Are you sure you're okay?

31
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:34,355
- I'm fine. Really, I am.

32
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:38,402
- All right, see you later.

33
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,147
- I was up all night
with the Bone Collector.

34
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:47,150
- Welcome to my world.
- I was going over his profile

35
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:49,761
thinking about
his very first kill.

36
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:51,241
Now, I don't care
how good he is now,

37
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:52,590
He would have made mistakes
then.

38
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:54,592
- He most likely made
plenty of mistakes.

39
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:58,770
- I think I found one.
Barry Rotko, 17,

40
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:02,165
Westchester County,
a missing persons case.

41
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:05,473
30 years ago,
Barry Rotko goes jogging,

42
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:07,301
never comes home.

43
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:10,347
Investigators find a pit dug

44
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:13,437
along the jogging path,
like a trap.

45
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:16,440
In it,
some of Rotko's blood.

46
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:20,357
- Oh, we know his M.O.:
kidnap, disable the victim,

47
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:22,359
kill them later somewhere else.

48
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:23,621
It's possible.

49
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:24,709
- I had Eric request
the original evidence.

50
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:27,451
We should have it by tomorrow.

51
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:31,194
Like you said,
new game, new rules.

52
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:33,805
- In the meantime,
Sellitto was on his way up.

53
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:37,200
I've got something else
for the team.

54
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:39,463
Her name is Kamala Patel,

55
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:42,205
murdered in her home
two nights ago.

56
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:45,295
- Any suspects?
- Her husband, Raj.

57
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:47,297
Witnesses heard them arguing.

58
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:49,473
The location of his phone
pings him to the house

59
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:51,649
at the time of the murder.

60
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:55,479
His prints are on
the murder weapon.

61
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:58,656
- Okay, I'll go out on a limb.
The guy did it.

62
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,877
- I'll co-sign that.
- He says he didn't.

63
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,185
- But the evidence
says otherwise, doesn't it?

64
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,882
- Yes, it does.

65
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:08,927
- Okay, I'm lost.

66
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:10,842
- Evidence reveals all.

67
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,409
What happened to that?

68
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:15,673
- Lincoln, I mean, you don't
usually bring us cases.

69
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:17,327
Why this one?

70
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:20,374
- The accused, Raj Patel,
went to Columbia with Naia.

71
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,506
She introduced him to Kamala.

72
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,855
- So you knew the victim.

73
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:27,468
- I did.
They were both friends of mine.

74
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:29,687
- I'm sorry.

75
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:31,689
- The four of us spent
a lot of time together.

76
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:35,345
I know him.

77
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,869
Raj didn't do this.

78
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:41,960
- Look, I'm very sorry
for your loss,

79
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:44,528
and I hate to play
Lincoln Rhyme here,

80
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:47,270
but just because you knew
the guy

81
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:48,445
doesn't meant
he didn't kill his wife.

82
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:49,968
- I realize that.

83
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,710
But something doesn't add up.

84
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:57,541
It's too neat,
too obvious.

85
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:00,718
- So we're taking the case

86
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:04,853
because the evidence
is too good.

87
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:06,463
- Exactly.

88
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:10,337
Raj is being held
pending arraignment.

89
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,599
Talk to him.

90
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:14,428
Get his side of the story.

91
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:17,257
Either find me something
to go on or convince me

92
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,695
that I don't know this man
the way I think I do.

93
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,305
- I didn't do it.

94
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:25,395
Please, you have to believe me.

95
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,834
- Why don't you start by
telling me about that night?

96
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:32,620
What happened?

97
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:35,927
- We had an argument.
- Oh, Raj, I'm sorry, okay?

98
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:38,016
I'm sorry.
Look, look, it's over, okay?

99
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,889
I ended it, I swear.

100
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:43,848
- Kamala had strayed away

101
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:46,373
from the marriage.

102
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,680
I was upset.

103
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:50,899
I'm done.

104
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:54,468
- No, Raj. No. Raj.

105
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,296
Raj.

106
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,298
- I stormed out.

107
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:11,615
And I realized
that I had forgotten my keys.

108
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:14,749
It was just a few minutes,

109
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:18,927
but when I came back in,
Kamala was...

110
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,022
Kamala.

111
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:30,808
No. No! Kamala!

112
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,073
It was awful.

113
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:40,775
- There was no sign anyone
had been in the room.

114
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,516
- No. None.

115
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:46,650
- Is there anything
you could remember

116
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:48,739
that might help us
figure this out?

117
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:53,440
- I wish there was.

118
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:57,966
I've lost everything.

119
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:01,535
My wife.

120
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:05,626
My life.

121
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:09,586
Naia always said Lincoln
can solve anything.

122
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,068
I need Lincoln's help, please.

123
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:16,550
- Lincoln, I can't believe it.

124
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:19,030
I just spoke
with Kamala last week.

125
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:21,076
She was gonna come out
and visit me.

126
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:24,166
- It's hit me hard too
knowing she's gone,

127
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,646
Raj being in prison.

128
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:28,475
- There's no way he did this.

129
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:30,651
You know that.
There's just no way.

130
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:32,522
He wouldn't.

131
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,045
- I know.

132
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:35,699
- You have to help him.

133
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:39,007
Lincoln, he needs you.

134
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,530
- I'll do everything I can
to try

135
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:42,445
and find out what happened.

136
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:44,186
- You'll get him out
of this, right?

137
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:47,450
I mean,
you'll find the evidence?

138
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:51,889
- Naia,
I'll do everything I can.

139
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:54,544
- I trust you, Lincoln.

140
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:57,025
I trust you to find the truth.

141
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:04,119
- It's not good, Lincoln.

142
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:06,034
We just came from the morgue.

143
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:07,949
There's no other traces
on the body,

144
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:10,212
no other prints on the knife.

145
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:12,693
- Amelia, you met him.

146
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:15,217
You sat with him.
What's your take?

147
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:18,873
- I think he's suffering.

148
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,571
He just lost his wife.

149
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:23,878
And when he says
he's innocent

150
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:27,795
- Do you believe him?

151
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:29,884
- I want to.

152
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:32,190
Someone's been training me
not to rely on my gut.

153
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:36,456
- Lincoln, all due respect,

154
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,240
I don't think we should be
on this case.

155
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:40,677
I think you're too
emotionally involved.

156
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:42,940
- I agree.

157
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:44,594
Look, I know he's your friend,

158
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:48,468
but he looks good for this.

159
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:52,036
- What do you think?

160
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:56,911
- I trust you, Lincoln.

161
00:07:56,954 --> 00:07:59,000
You're not sentimental,

162
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:02,569
and you're not
easily swayed my emotion.

163
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:05,702
So if you truly believe
the evidence is out there

164
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:08,879
to exonerate him,

165
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:10,533
then I say we have to
go find it.

166
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:25,983
.

167
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:28,682
- Okay,
I'm in Kamala's art studio.

168
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:32,903
There's a considerable
amount of blood.

169
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:36,994
I'm sorry, Lincoln.

170
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:38,996
I know she was your friend.

171
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,607
- I don't need a therapist,
Amelia.

172
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,565
I just need to see.

173
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:46,264
- Well, I see footprints.

174
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,092
- Yes.
The crime scene reports states

175
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:49,877
that it belongs to Raj.

176
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,793
He says he discovered her body,
so that's not unusual.

177
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:55,970
- The thing I can't
figure out is,

178
00:08:56,013 --> 00:09:00,627
Raj said he left the house,
realized he forgot his keys,

179
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,803
was back in three minutes tops.

180
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:04,761
- The killer had
a simple way in.

181
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,682
- Well, the door hasn't been
tampered with.

182
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:17,121
Maybe Raj left it unlocked.

183
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,296
- What about the windows?

184
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:32,920
Wait.

185
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:34,008
See that?

186
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,097
- What?

187
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,013
- Two distinct smudges
on the outside of the glass.

188
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:40,275
Get closer.

189
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:43,931
- Oh, yeah.

190
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:46,237
- Cup your hands to your face.

191
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,201
- Palm prints.

192
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:55,638
The outer edges.

193
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,684
- Collect that trace.

194
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,642
Oil from the hands
will give us DNA,

195
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:01,644
so we'll know
who was spying on the Patels.

196
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:03,211
- Or who was trying to get in.

197
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:08,042
- Why did we find your
palm prints on a window, Dave?

198
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,741
You know this woman?

199
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:14,962
- That's Kamala, my neighbor.

200
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:19,357
- Those prints make it clear
you were spying on her.

201
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,577
- Kamala and me,
we were friends.

202
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,709
Neighbors look out
for each other, you know.

203
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,014
I was checking on her.

204
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:26,190
- So why not knock on the door,

205
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:27,844
ring the doorbell,
give her a call?

206
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:30,673
- Because you were
creeping on her, hmm?

207
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,806
- I was worried about her.

208
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:35,243
Heard her fighting with
her husband a few nights ago.

209
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:37,593
I thought maybe
- You'd just swoop in.

210
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,771
Maybe she rejected you.

211
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:46,733
You got angry,
lost control.

212
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:49,083
- I was working the night
she died.

213
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,085
There are time logs,
security cameras.

214
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:52,956
You can check.

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,611
- You see anybody else?
A guy she was with?

216
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,961
Anything unusual?

217
00:10:58,005 --> 00:11:00,224
- There was an electrical van
idling the whole time

218
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:04,968
I was there,
seemed weird to me.

219
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:06,622
I don't know why you're wasting
your time with me.

220
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,104
It was obviously her husband.
That guy has problems.

221
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:16,240
- Dave Chen's alibi
checked out.

222
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:19,766
- He's a creepy perv,
but he didn't kill Kamala.

223
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,681
- And her boss,
the one she was sleeping with,

224
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,900
his wife confirms his alibi.

225
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:26,686
- Lincoln, I know there are
no dead ends, but

226
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:29,950
- There are no paths to follow.
I found one.

227
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:33,214
I started with the hypothesis
that Raj is innocent,

228
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:36,739
yet the evidence points to him.

229
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:41,962
Two similar cases
within the last six months.

230
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:43,877
Wives stabbed multiple times
in the torso.

231
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,705
Witnesses heard them fighting,

232
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:47,402
husbands tied
to the murder scene,

233
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:50,057
their prints
on the murder weapon.

234
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,754
- I hate to be
the naysayer here,

235
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:55,758
but husbands killing
their wives, it happens.

236
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:58,108
- And then there's this.

237
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:01,851
When you look at all three
victims, tell me what you see.

238
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:05,463
- No defensive wounds.
- Right.

239
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:07,161
With stabbings, you see wounds
on their hands and arms

240
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:08,771
from them
trying to defend themselves.

241
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:09,903
- Kamala was a fighter.

242
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:11,774
She would
have fought like hell.

243
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:13,994
- So you're saying
there's a connection

244
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:15,691
between these three cases.

245
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,388
- Let's talk to the husbands.

246
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:21,001
- I may have an answer to why
there are no defensive wounds.

247
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:23,220
Taser marks.

248
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:26,049
- Uh, not seeing it.

249
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:28,486
- Which is why
the M.E. missed it.

250
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,837
The killer incapacitated them
with a Taser

251
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,361
and then stabbed them over
the Taser marks to cover it up.

252
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:35,363
Look.
If you look closely,

253
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:40,020
you can see the fractional edge
of a superficial burn here

254
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:44,154
and small puncture wound
from the metal probe here.

255
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,809
He went through a lot
of trouble to cover his tracks.

256
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,768
- We're talking one M.O.
One killer.

257
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,335
- Which means Raj is innocent
and there's a serial killer

258
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,337
out there
planning the perfect murder.

259
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:04,131
- You've got to be kidding me.

260
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,291
Oh, my God.

261
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:53,615
.

262
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:55,791
- I know everything
points to me.

263
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,053
But I didn't kill her.

264
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:59,403
- I had a one-night stand,
and she found out.

265
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:01,014
But that's all I'm guilty of.

266
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:04,060
- We had our issues,
but what couple doesn't?

267
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:05,670
- I was angry.

268
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:09,544
- Yes, we fought.
- I said I wished she was dead.

269
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:11,633
- I was only out the room for,
like, five minutes.

270
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:13,417
- And I know that points
the finger at me,

271
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:15,419
but it's not so.

272
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:17,334
- She was gone.

273
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:21,599
I tried to stop the bleeding,
but it was too late.

274
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:23,471
- I had her blood all over me.

275
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:28,302
- It was awful.

276
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:31,958
I can't unsee her
just lying there on the ground.

277
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:34,830
- My prints were on the knife.
Any jury would convict.

278
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,442
- My lawyer said it would
be best if I took the ten years

279
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:39,966
than spend
the rest of my life here.

280
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,532
- You have to believe me.

281
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:43,491
I didn't do this.

282
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:45,449
- Someone else killed my wife.

283
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:47,930
- Please, you have
to believe me.

284
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:50,498
- Got to say,
these guys sound credible.

285
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,978
- Their stories are identical.

286
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,936
- Yeah, even I'm starting
to believe them.

287
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,070
- We're looking at three
murders, three innocent people.

288
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:58,767
- You know,
for somebody to do this,

289
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,856
to time it just right, how?

290
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,945
- Start by taking a new look
at the evidence.

291
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:05,992
- Evidence for all three cases
organized accordingly.

292
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:08,820
- Good. We look at every piece
of evidence,

293
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:12,737
every fingerprint, every hair,
fiber, and speck of dust.

294
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:15,610
- Got it.
Leave no stone unturned.

295
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,481
- Sounds like I should
make coffee.

296
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:20,789
The big pot.

297
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,053
- Can't believe
I'm saying this,

298
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:27,535
but I can't find anything.

299
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:29,885
- Hey, investigators
did their due diligence.

300
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,582
The evidence points
to the husbands.

301
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:32,801
- Yeah, I mean,
there's no connection

302
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:33,976
between these couples.

303
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,717
I mean,
they didn't know each other.

304
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,371
They didn't go
to the same places.

305
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:38,981
How would the killer know
to target them?

306
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,418
- I think I can help.

307
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,986
This is from Raj's house.

308
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,466
It's called a HomeStar.

309
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:47,729
- A server, right?
- Correct.

310
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:49,557
Now,
it runs your home's networks.

311
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,125
Well, I checked. The other
two victims had one as well.

312
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:53,691
- Which tell us what?

313
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:55,563
- How our killer
got information on the victims.

314
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:57,652
- By hacking the server,
he was able to gain access

315
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,175
to their phones,
their computers.

316
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:01,047
- Gave him the keys
to their personal lives.

317
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,831
- Exactly.

318
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:06,139
Look, let's say we want
to get information about Eric.

319
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:07,967
You know,
learn his dark secrets.

320
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,969
- Not a chance.

321
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,145
Got a security app on my phone,
my vault.

322
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:13,624
- Really?

323
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:18,499
Okay.

324
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:26,115
"I'm E. Die-hard Mets fan.

325
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,725
"Wiz in the kitchen.

326
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:31,033
Good listener.
Sundays are fun days."

327
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,775
- Swipe left.

328
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:37,083
- Profile's public.
Anyone can see that.

329
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:40,086
- Okay, E.

330
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,870
How about this?

331
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:47,963
Security cameras
inside your house.

332
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:52,924
- Oh. That's deeply disturbing.

333
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:55,014
And I was able to do that
in mere seconds.

334
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,973
Get me a sophisticated
metadata, I can get a lot more.

335
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,802
- How much more?
- Texts, emails.

336
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:02,978
Look, it's as simple
as a Google search.

337
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,806
Type a key phrase
into the search bar

338
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,242
of a
sophisticated program

339
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:10,986
"hate," "affair," "kill you"
you're gonna get hits.

340
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,815
- Like profiling, he knows
the key words to search,

341
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,643
the precursors to the fights.

342
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:17,862
- Wait for the moment their
fight's about to boil over.

343
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,864
- That's when he strikes.

344
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,868
- Sellitto.

345
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:28,656
- So the guy has to have left
some kind of digital footprint.

346
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:32,703
- With the search tools we have
now, no footprint at all.

347
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:35,532
Look, if this guy's as good
as I think he is,

348
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:37,882
we're not catching him online.

349
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:39,145
He's a ghost.

350
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:42,887
- Thanks.
Sorry to pile on with bad news,

351
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:45,542
but it looks like
our killer struck again.

352
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:49,851
Wife dead. No defensive wounds.
Husband in custody.

353
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:52,593
- This killer thinks
he's invisible.

354
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:56,075
But every move,
every step, every breath,

355
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,034
he makes himself visible to us.

356
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,167
So let's find him.

357
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,212
- Victim is Samantha Layton,
33.

358
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:06,737
Multiple stab wounds.
- Taser?

359
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:08,043
- Told the M.E. on site
to look.

360
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,176
I'll confirm at the morgue.

361
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:12,091
- Well, what do we know
about their marriage?

362
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:14,005
- Well, they owned this
real estate business together,

363
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:15,572
but it was failing.

364
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:17,313
- There's records
of arguments in emails, texts,

365
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:20,055
and the office manager
heard them argue a lot.

366
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,710
- Husband's in custody
telling everyone he's innocent.

367
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:23,928
- And they have a HomeStar.

368
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,758
We'll keep you updated
if we find any more info.

369
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:43,557
- House has been converted
into an office.

370
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,300
- Show me the windows.

371
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:50,085
- There's a thin layer of dust
on them.

372
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,739
I don't think
they've been opened.

373
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:53,784
- The killer got in somehow.

374
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:56,700
What about the front door?

375
00:18:56,744 --> 00:19:01,227
- Uh...

376
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,707
No sign of forced entry.

377
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:09,322
And the back door is
dead-bolted from the inside.

378
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,935
- Felix says all the victims'
security cameras were disabled

379
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:17,808
at the time of the murder,
including the door cam.

380
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:19,114
- So you think the killer

381
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,029
just walked in
through the front door?

382
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:22,248
- Bring me the lock.

383
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,903
If he did breach the lock,

384
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:28,123
I want to see
if he left us something.

385
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,081
- Hmm.

386
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,257
Want to know how they got in?

387
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,173
- Yeah.

388
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:37,393
- See this plastic splinter?

389
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:40,222
It's part of a 3-D printed key.

390
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:42,964
- Well, how did
the perp get a key?

391
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:44,792
I mean, I know
they have digital access,

392
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:47,186
but not actual access.

393
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,405
- If Felix was right,
all they would have to do

394
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:51,277
is get the security images
of the front door

395
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,235
from HomeStar,
zoom in on the key

396
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,803
when the targets came in,
take a screenshot,

397
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:59,633
and then make a 3-D
printed key from that.

398
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:01,417
- I really need to upgrade
my home security system.

399
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:05,160
Wow, so we were right.

400
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:09,033
The killer just walked through
the front door.

401
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:13,255
- And that is why the timing
of the murders was so perfect.

402
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,736
- Because these couples had
a killer in their midst,

403
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:17,303
and they didn't even know it.

404
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:34,711
.

405
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:36,931
- How'd it go?
- Met with the DA.

406
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:39,238
She's willing to wait
on a formal indictment,

407
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,413
but if we don't prove
this theory,

408
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:42,502
they're gonna hit Raj
with murder one.

409
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:45,200
- Are they still holding him?
- They have 72 hours.

410
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,681
- How's he doing?
- Last I talked to him,

411
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:51,554
he was trying to hold
on to hope...but losing.

412
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:54,949
- Mm.
- Well, I've got his back.

413
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:56,864
I was able to get a partial
print from the key fragment.

414
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:59,954
Not enough to run,
but if we land a suspect,

415
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:00,955
I'll be able to match it.

416
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:02,913
- Okay, got something.

417
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:06,656
I did a deep dive on the
electrical van Dave Chen saw.

418
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,441
Now, it could be nothing,
but it could be a cover

419
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:10,399
for the killer to be
in the neighborhood.

420
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:12,227
There were no photos of it
at the other crime scenes,

421
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,968
but there was a security camera
across the street

422
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:15,448
from the second victim's house.

423
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:17,014
- Tracked it down.

424
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:19,495
We got this.

425
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,584
Check out the lettering.

426
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:24,021
- E-L-E?
- If that says electrical,

427
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:26,807
that places the same van
at two crime scenes.

428
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,417
- Right, but we don't even know

429
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:30,027
if it's a real electrical van
or a cover.

430
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,029
- Oh, and that's why I pulled
all registered

431
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:34,945
commercial electrical vans
in the tri-state area.

432
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:36,904
Thousands.

433
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:40,386
- But...

434
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:43,040
maybe there's a way
we can narrow it down.

435
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,565
Dave Chen said the van
was idling the entire time

436
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:46,870
he was outside Kamala's house.

437
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:48,481
It was cold that night.

438
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:50,265
He was probably
running the heater,

439
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,355
which means it was likely
releasing some kind of fluids.

440
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,792
- You think we can get a trace
from the van

441
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:58,404
in a city full of cars
leaking fluid?

442
00:21:58,447 --> 00:21:59,579
- I think it rained
right before.

443
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:01,320
I think that narrows the odds.

444
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,799
If Sellitto and Eric
can find out

445
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:06,325
exactly where Chen thinks
it was parked, we can try.

446
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,979
- So we're looking for a needle
in an asphalt haystack.

447
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:11,330
- Mm, no more unlikely
than the parking ticket

448
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,809
that nailed Son of Sam

449
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:16,422
or Ted Bundy being pulled over
for driving a stolen car.

450
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:21,296
Every scrap of evidence
leads back to someone.

451
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,858
- Danielle?
- You need to come home.

452
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:03,860
- Why? What's wrong?

453
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:06,428
- I just need you
to come home now.

454
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:10,867
- Okay. I'll be right there.

455
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,867
- Eric and Sellitto
brought me asphalt

456
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,129
from where the van was parked.

457
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:56,696
- You can get
something from it?

458
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:59,089
- It's called a poultice.

459
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:02,702
Lay it on top of any granite,
marble, or asphalt surface,

460
00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:05,139
pulls all the oil out.

461
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:09,056
Makes for a great
homemade cleaner.

462
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:10,057
You good?

463
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:15,802
- I guess I'm still shocked at
Lincoln's emotional involvement

464
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:16,803
in this case.

465
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:21,590
I feel for him.

466
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,812
- He doesn't look like he cares
all the time.

467
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:29,424
But here's a little secret
about Lincoln Rhyme.

468
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,688
He cares all the time.

469
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,611
- Please tell me they found

470
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:44,091
more than
just potholes out there.

471
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:46,485
- The poultice pulled out
the oil from the asphalt

472
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:47,834
with a high concentration
of zinc

473
00:24:47,877 --> 00:24:50,576
dialkyl dithiophosphate.

474
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:53,579
An additive used to prevent
engine wear in older cars.

475
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:55,885
- Which tells us that the van
is at least six years old.

476
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:57,887
So that narrows the list.

477
00:24:57,931 --> 00:25:01,500
But get this, that particular
additive, it's an off-brand.

478
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,806
It's only sold at two repair
shops in the five boroughs.

479
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,504
I ran receipts
from the last year,

480
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,940
narrowed the listing further.

481
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:09,986
- By how many?
- Two electrical vans.

482
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,032
And one was a van
from Elmwood Electric.

483
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,207
So the company went
out of business.

484
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,774
They sold up their fleet
at an auction.

485
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:16,863
I got list of the customers,
ran the names,

486
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:19,039
got a hit on a guy
in the system

487
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:22,608
for a hacking charge.
Ran the prints. Guess what.

488
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:25,045
- Matched our partial prints.

489
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:28,918
- Garrett Harrison.
Tech support at HomeStar.

490
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:31,573
- Eric's putting a BOLO out.
- He was fired ten months ago.

491
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:34,576
- Fired why?
- Interpersonal conflict.

492
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,623
I dug into his background
and found the real kicker.

493
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:39,581
When he was a teenager,
his father killed his mother

494
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,975
right in front of him
after one too many fights.

495
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:44,499
Father went on trial,
beat the rap,

496
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,153
destroyed the family.

497
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:48,024
- Well, at least now

498
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:50,505
we know why
he targets fighting couples.

499
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,899
- He's acting out what he saw
his parents do.

500
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:54,683
- This happened
when he was a teenager.

501
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:56,642
Why has he
suddenly started killing?

502
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:58,513
- Anything could have triggered
him, really.

503
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,820
- I've got his address,
but be careful.

504
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:01,995
He's ahead of us.

505
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:03,692
- You're right, Felix.

506
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:07,566
Which is why
I want you to go with them.

507
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:11,787
- Right.
Yeah, II can do that.

508
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:35,158
- Okay, on three. One. Two.

509
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:37,291
- Wait.
I'm getting a Z-Wave signal

510
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,162
coming from inside the unit.

511
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:41,208
- What?
- Meaning Garrett's running

512
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:43,558
a smart lock
on the door itself.

513
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,255
He can control it
from anywhere.

514
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,127
- Yeah, but we're gonna bypass
that the old-fashioned way.

515
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,651
- Which would trigger an alarm.

516
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,218
He could remotely erase
the hard drive before

517
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:54,134
we have a chance to look at it.

518
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:56,658
I can bypass it the new way.

519
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:57,616
- Okay.

520
00:27:01,968 --> 00:27:04,579
- NYPD!

521
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:09,845
Clear.

522
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,856
- Clear.
- First floor's clear.

523
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,944
Check in the basement.

524
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:31,911
- Are you gambling again?

525
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:33,739
You promised that you'd stop.

526
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:37,090
- Basement's clear.
Look at this setup.

527
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:39,048
- Lincoln, are you seeing this?

528
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:42,312
He's got multiple camera angles
from inside their house.

529
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:45,228
- You lost all of it.

530
00:27:45,272 --> 00:27:48,884
- Looks like we just found
his next target.

531
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:53,323
.

532
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,108
- Their entire house is run
through a HomeStar.

533
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:56,762
Security cameras.

534
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:58,764
He's been watching for weeks.

535
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:00,461
- Yeah, this guy's sick.

536
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:03,725
- Continue playing that video.

537
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:06,597
- You lost all of it?

538
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:07,816
- I won't do it again.

539
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,644
I promise.

540
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,820
- We never should have bought
this house.

541
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:15,302
We can't pay our bills.
We can't pay our mortgage.

542
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:17,217
I could kill you.

543
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,567
- "I could kill you"?

544
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,222
Sounds like the kind of fight
that would trigger him.

545
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:23,658
- Yeah, for all we know,
he could be there now.

546
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,486
- We need names, address,
phone numbers.

547
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:27,401
We've got to warn them.
- On it.

548
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,319
- What just happened?

549
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:35,409
- He wrote a self-destruct code
to prevent unauthorized logins.

550
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:37,541
I can beat him.
It's gonna take time.

551
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:38,673
- There might be another way.

552
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,153
- What are you thinking?

553
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:42,808
- Rewind.

554
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:44,679
Stop.

555
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,812
The style looks
to be Medieval Revival,

556
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:48,596
pointed arch windows,
chandelier,

557
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:51,686
all original
and meticulously maintained.

558
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,861
It could be an historic home.

559
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:56,952
Zoom in on the husband's shirt.

560
00:28:56,996 --> 00:28:59,868
It's an emblem for the Bronx
Museum of Natural History.

561
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:02,697
He could live somewhere
in the vicinity of the Bronx.

562
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:07,354
There are a handful of historic
districts in the Bronx.

563
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:10,270
Wait.

564
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:13,490
Enlarge the right side
of the frame.

565
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:16,842
The book on the coffee table,
zoom in.

566
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:18,887
It's a book
on Dwight James Baum,

567
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:21,847
noted architect
of the early 20th century.

568
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,500
He did most of his work
in the Bronx,

569
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:25,198
where he built half the homes

570
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:28,375
in what would become the
Fieldston Historic District.

571
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:30,377
- Can you narrow it down
a little more?

572
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,815
- It's a small area,
about 250 homes.

573
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,991
But they were arguing that
they shouldn't have bought it.

574
00:29:36,035 --> 00:29:37,863
I'll check recent real estate
listings to see

575
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:38,864
if I can match the interior.

576
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:40,866
Give me a minute.

577
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:42,606
- We'll head there now to see
if we can spot the van.

578
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,651
- I'm gonna stay here
and see if I can

579
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:44,783
get this back up and running.

580
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:46,262
- I'll let the unis know.

581
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:50,919
- I've got it.

582
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:53,356
4400 Waldo Avenue.

583
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,576
The house is listed under
Richard and Michaela Garfield.

584
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:57,447
- Let's go.

585
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:01,234
- ESU is five minutes out.

586
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:03,889
Electrical van's
been spotted outside.

587
00:30:03,932 --> 00:30:08,328
- Exigent circumstances
if ever I saw it.

588
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:11,810
- Lincoln, we're going in.

589
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,508
- Door's unlocked.

590
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:30,393
- Hands up. NYPD.

591
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:32,569
- What's happening?
- Richard Garfield?

592
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:33,744
There's an intruder
in your house.

593
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:35,355
Is your wife home?

594
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:37,270
- Oh God, Michaela.
- We'll get her.

595
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:38,575
I need you to wait outside,
Richard.

596
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:40,273
- But my wife.
- We will find her.

597
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:44,364
I need you outside.

598
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:47,454
Husband's secure.
Wife's in the house.

599
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,024
- Felix says,
with his set up gear,

600
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,808
he can watch you
from his phone.

601
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,766
I want you all
to move carefully.

602
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,377
Take care of each other.

603
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,467
- Yeah.
I like the sound of that.

604
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,644
Okay.

605
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:06,038
I'm gonna move room to room

606
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:10,912
until we...Lincoln?

607
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:12,783
- He's controlling the lights.

608
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:19,312
- It's pitch black in here,
Lincoln.

609
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:21,618
- Felix engineered your rig
with night vision.

610
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:22,750
I'll help guide you.

611
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:24,839
Night vision mode.

612
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:29,061
I still can't see.

613
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:30,540
- You can do this, Amelia.

614
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:44,903
There's a hallway
in front of you with a door.

615
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:00,875
- NYPD. You're gonna be okay.

616
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:07,012
I need paramedics.

617
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:09,579
Got female victim,
stabbed in the chest.

618
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:13,757
Okay.
Hang on. I'm getting you help.

619
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:38,521
- She needs to hear your voice.

620
00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:42,699
- You're doing great, Amelia.

621
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:44,049
One step at a time.

622
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,485
I'm right here with you.

623
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:47,661
Breath. Just breath.

624
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:54,668
There's a door ahead.

625
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,671
It's slightly ajar.

626
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:14,949
- I'm checking the basement.

627
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,733
- Ambo's here.

628
00:33:16,777 --> 00:33:20,824
ESU is two minutes out.
I'm checking the perimeter.

629
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:34,534
- What is this?
- Some sort of storage base.

630
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:36,057
- Who are these people?

631
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,504
- Stop.

632
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:51,464
Amelia, be still.

633
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:53,770
Don't say a word.

634
00:33:53,814 --> 00:33:56,860
At 5:00 is a man hiding.

635
00:33:56,904 --> 00:33:59,646
Now,
we don't know what he can see.

636
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:02,562
Eric, get down there.
Felix, get those lights on.

637
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,956
- I know you're there.

638
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:10,570
Garrett?

639
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:12,572
We know who you are.

640
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:15,009
We know what
you've been through.

641
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:19,666
We know everything.

642
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:22,625
I know you've been hurt,

643
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:25,193
and I know you want
to hurt people back.

644
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:28,588
- You think you can
talk me down?

645
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:32,287
Lead me to some sort
of breakthrough, hmm?

646
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:34,768
- I want you to know
that I get it.

647
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:35,725
Look, I can help you.

648
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:41,296
You know
you're not walking out of here.

649
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,126
So it's up to you
how this plays out, okay?

650
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,214
This can end easily...

651
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,872
Or the hard way.

652
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:55,702
All you have to do is...

653
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:57,225
Ugh!

654
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:58,531
- Amelia!

655
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:00,576
Amelia.

656
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:06,147
.

657
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:07,583
- Amelia, talk to me.

658
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:08,715
Felix, we need those lights.

659
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:09,890
- Just a few more seconds.

660
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,413
- We don't have
a few more seconds.

661
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:44,403
- Amelia.
- Yeah.

662
00:35:52,454 --> 00:35:53,673
- Tell me you're okay.

663
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:55,109
- I'm good.

664
00:35:57,633 --> 00:35:59,418
Someone should call Lincoln.

665
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:06,207
Suspect in custody.

666
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:09,341
- Okay. What was the gunshot?

667
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:12,779
- Me firing at shadows.

668
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:14,302
- And hitting them.

669
00:36:15,521 --> 00:36:17,740
- She got him.

670
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:20,439
- Yes, she did.

671
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:22,571
Great job, Amelia.

672
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:33,147
- He's stable.
Medic thinks it was

673
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,672
a through-and-through and
didn't hit any major arteries.

674
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:39,240
Not bad for a blind shot.

675
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:41,242
- Well, I wasn't blind.

676
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:42,417
I had Lincoln.

677
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:47,553
He was my eyes for a change.

678
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:50,469
- What about Michaela?
- She's on her way to surgery,

679
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:52,645
but they say
she's gonna be okay.

680
00:36:52,688 --> 00:36:55,778
We must have stopped him
when we came in.

681
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:58,390
Felix is working the apartment.
He thinks he found the trigger.

682
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:00,261
Garrett's neighbor said
he had a girlfriend.

683
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:02,829
They had a huge fight.
She ghosted him.

684
00:37:02,872 --> 00:37:06,746
- Let me guess.
This was six months ago

685
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:09,792
right before the first murder.

686
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:12,491
- You know, Amelia, you really
should go to the hospital,

687
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:15,537
make sure you're okay.

688
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:17,800
- I'm okay.

689
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:20,890
Thank you.

690
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,457
I, uh,

691
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:24,459
I have somewhere else
I need to be.

692
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:27,506
- Mm.

693
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:33,816
- They're letting me go?
- By morning.

694
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,341
They're dropping the charges,
Raj.

695
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:38,952
Same with the others.

696
00:37:44,653 --> 00:37:46,742
- Thank you, Lincoln.

697
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:48,962
You saved Raj's life.

698
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,920
- It won't bring Kamala back.

699
00:37:50,964 --> 00:37:54,315
- No, but at least he has
a chance to heal.

700
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:55,621
- Mm.

701
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:57,927
Now we all can.

702
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:00,930
- I talked to Kamala's mother.

703
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:02,715
Her funeral is this Sunday
in New Hampshire.

704
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:05,195
I'm gonna fly out for it.

705
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:07,502
- I'd like to be there.

706
00:38:07,546 --> 00:38:10,244
- And I'd like to see you.

707
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,597
But I know you're...

708
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:16,990
busy.

709
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:23,692
- We're getting closer
to the Bone Collector,

710
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:27,696
hunting old cases,
taking a new approach.

711
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,438
I'm gonna find him
this time, Naia.

712
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:33,267
Put that fear to rest
once and for all.

713
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,921
- I hope so...for all of us.

714
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:42,015
- Tell Camden I love him.

715
00:38:42,058 --> 00:38:43,277
- I will.

716
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:00,294
Come in.

717
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:02,992
- You have a visitor.

718
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:04,907
- Oh.

719
00:39:04,951 --> 00:39:06,953
Don't you think you've earned
a good night's sleep?

720
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:09,390
- Ahh,
I earned more than that.

721
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:10,652
- Mm.

722
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:13,351
- But I seem to remember
you making a promise

723
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:16,005
to find the Bone Collector,

724
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:19,052
and the Barry Rotko boxes
have arrived.

725
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:24,405
Unless, you know,
you're too tired.

726
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,583
- Claire,
put on some coffee?

727
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:32,326
- One coffee and one
green smoothie coming up.

728
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,373
- I'd like to thank you.

729
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:39,072
- No need.

730
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,381
We did it for you.

731
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,518
Should we get started?

732
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:55,436
- Let's find
the Bone Collector.

733
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:12,061
- Hey.

734
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:21,680
Everything okay?

735
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:22,768
- We need to talk.

736
00:40:26,032 --> 00:40:29,992
I found these today.
They were hidden in the wall.

737
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:32,865
I couldn't even look
at them all.

738
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,829
- These are awful.

739
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:43,484
- I'm shaking.

740
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:45,834
I think these are real.

741
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:49,490
I think someone who lived here
before us might be

742
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:51,753
- A killer.

743
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:54,843
We should call the police.

744
00:40:54,887 --> 00:40:58,456
- Yes. Yes. I'll call 911.

745
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:02,024
- No,
911 is for imminent danger.

746
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:04,853
We'llwe'll call
first thing tomorrow.

747
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:07,769
- Tomorrow?
- It'll wait.

748
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:11,599
- No, honey, this is bad.

749
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:13,427
And this guy
could still be out there.

750
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:18,040
I thinkI mean, some of these
pictureslike, this is...

751
00:41:18,084 --> 00:41:19,912
Jane.

752
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,114
- Come with me.

753
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:49,115
Trust me.

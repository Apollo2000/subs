- There you go.

793
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:54,462
Will you do the honors?

794
00:38:54,506 --> 00:38:57,596
[soft music]

795
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:00,686
- To success.
- Success.

796
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:02,340
Salud.
- Salud.

797
00:39:10,217 --> 00:39:14,134
- So...tomorrow.

798
00:39:14,177 --> 00:39:18,399
Back to the Bone Collector?
- Why wait till tomorrow?

799
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:20,227
You know what Einstein
was doing when he came up

800
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:24,057
with the theory of relativity?
- Looking out the window.

801
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,538
You know, you told me that
story a thousand times.

802
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:28,714
Loves to compare himself
to Einstein.

803
00:39:28,757 --> 00:39:31,543
- I have better hair.
- [laughs]

804
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:33,283
- While we caught a bomber
today,

805
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:34,850
a thought rose
to the surface for me.

806
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:36,939
We didn't find the
Bone Collector's first kill,

807
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:39,289
but we may have something
equally useful.

808
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:40,595
- Which is what?

809
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,423
- I think we found
his hometown.

810
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,904
- And given his age--
- Age of the victim.

811
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:46,384
- He was quick to unearth
that crime,

812
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:49,822
which suggests you're right.
He made mistakes.

813
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:51,084
And that means
there's more mistakes,

814
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:53,478
likely mistakes
he hasn't even considered,

815
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:55,436
waiting for us
if we dig deep enough.

816
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,178
- I'm betting he knows it.

817
00:39:58,221 --> 00:40:00,485
He knows we're getting close.

818
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:03,879
- We got him on the run.
- Scour the area,

819
00:40:03,923 --> 00:40:08,449
talk to the people,
look into the past.

820
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:10,277
The answer is there.

821
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,975
It's only a matter of time.

822
00:40:14,977 --> 00:40:16,370
[knife clicks]

823
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,503
- [whimpers]

824
00:40:18,546 --> 00:40:21,680
[muffled yelling]

825
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:27,033
- Shh, shh, shh.
It's not what you think.

826
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:29,252
- [muffed scream]

827
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:30,689
- You're right.
- [strangled sob]

828
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:32,560
- I have been...
[grunts]

829
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:35,476
what's the word...
agitated.

830
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,132
You've been the one
who's held me together.

831
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:40,307
[tape rips]

832
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,395
- [panting]

833
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,484
- Still...

834
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:48,924
I can't help feeling this
might be the most foolish thing

835
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:50,622
I've ever done.

836
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:54,495
Freeing you.

837
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:57,716
- [sighs]
[groans]

838
00:40:57,759 --> 00:41:01,023
[sobs]

839
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:02,547
[gasps]

840
00:41:03,765 --> 00:41:06,464
[panting]

841
00:41:07,377 --> 00:41:10,032
[exhales]
Peter.

842
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:12,905
[bone cracks]

843
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:24,482
- [exhales deeply]

844
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,401
Requiem, requiem...

845
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:33,229
[exhales]

846
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:35,884
[whispers] Rest now.

847
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:38,757
[humming]

848
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,934

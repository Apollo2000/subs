You can thank

3
00:00:02,829 --> 00:00:04,596
Officer Sachs here
for saving that evidence.

4
00:00:04,631 --> 00:00:06,328
Do you know how the Bone
Collector got his name?

5
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:07,433
He wrote a letter saying

6
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:09,260
most people are just piles of bones.

7
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:10,536
What about the postmark?

8
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,137
Tracked it back
to Farmington, New Mexico.

9
00:00:12,172 --> 00:00:13,205
Going through security video

10
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:14,506
from the originating post office.

11
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,108
He'd avoid cameras at all costs.

12
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:18,744
I'd love to get in a sneak
of your secret lair

13
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:20,646
one day when you're not at home.

14
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,780
You're not gonna believe this.

15
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:24,049
Jane... she's gone.
I think somebody took her.

16
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:37,729
Decay is as natural to death
as death is to life.

17
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:41,767
Decomp fields like this give us
a humane way to examine remains

18
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:43,836
when affected by various elements.

19
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,539
Weather, wildlife, indoor, outdoor.

20
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:49,041
No crimes.

21
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:50,976
Each of the field's residents
died naturally,

22
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,511
donating their bodies to science

23
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:54,513
to show us what death has in store.

24
00:00:54,547 --> 00:00:57,282
Studying the process of decay
serves a crucial purpose.

25
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:59,618
To help solve murders
using forensic evidence

26
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:01,954
gathered from the remains.

27
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:04,289
By analyzing each stage
of the decomposition process,

28
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:06,278
we can help pinpoint the time of death.

29
00:01:07,894 --> 00:01:10,229
A process that, as you can see,

30
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:12,389
takes time to get used to.

31
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:15,667
How quickly does a body
start to decompose?

32
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:17,569
The process begins immediately

33
00:01:17,604 --> 00:01:19,605
after the heart stops beating.

34
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:22,908
Hey, guys?

35
00:01:22,942 --> 00:01:24,409
I think this one's moving.

36
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:27,012
That's impossible.

37
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,117
Is there an animal under there?

38
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:38,957
Oh, God.

39
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:40,726
Call 911!

40
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,028
Oh, my God.

Ready for some movie magic?

43
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:58,410
This is the first ever image
of the Bone Collector.

44
00:01:58,444 --> 00:02:00,879
You're really going to pause for fanfare?

45
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:02,514
Okay.

46
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,583
I was able to restore
the manager's cell phone video

47
00:02:04,617 --> 00:02:06,385
from the shipping center in New Mexico.

48
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:10,322
You'll be the first one to see
it along with me, right now.

49
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:13,425
- It's not him.
- No.

50
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:14,660
No, it's not.

51
00:02:14,694 --> 00:02:16,795
Why risk mailing a package on camera

52
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,063
when you can pay some junkie teenager

53
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,164
to do it for you?

54
00:02:19,998 --> 00:02:21,500
Wait, pause it.

55
00:02:21,534 --> 00:02:23,902
Go back to before the kid went in.

56
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:28,307
Hey, zoom in.

57
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,446
That's him.

58
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,182
A white male.

59
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:39,309
Reflection's not helping much
with the details.

60
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:42,921
Looks like he made a phone call.

61
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:45,123
Please tell me you can get
something with that.

62
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:46,158
It's gonna take some time,

63
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:47,392
but I've got a few tricks I can use.

64
00:02:47,427 --> 00:02:48,760
All right, use them all.

65
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:50,929
Lincoln? Fred Hawkins is here.

66
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:52,831
- Who?
- Sellitto's friend.

67
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:54,766
Firefighter, same injury as you.

68
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:56,435
I told you, I'm not interested.

69
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:58,804
And I ignored you and set it up.

70
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,525
Heads up, you're walking
into a firefight.

71
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,919
I've been warned.
I think I can handle him.

72
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:11,365
Lincoln Rhyme.
It's great to finally meet you.

73
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,933
Sorry you got dragged over here.

74
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:14,635
I'm actually tied up in a case.

75
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:16,270
That's great. You're back at work.

76
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:17,437
So if you'll excuse me...

77
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:19,239
Maybe just a quick cup of coffee?

78
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:22,142
Saw a great place by the corner.

79
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:23,456
Then I'll let you get back to it.

80
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,945
Despite what you might've heard, Fred,

81
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:26,647
I don't need a pep talk.

82
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:28,415
Last time someone told me to be hopeful

83
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:30,150
was the day my reawakened mobility

84
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:31,945
returned to its stubborn slumber.

85
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,489
I've been told that you've been creating

86
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:37,724
an amazing world for yourself up here,

87
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,426
and that's great.

88
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,461
I also think that the world out there

89
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:43,030
is still out there for you too.

90
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:46,220
That's truly motivational, Fred, but...

91
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:47,801
You had a deep love of this city.

92
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:51,171
No, I breathed this city.

93
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:52,906
It pulsed in my veins.

94
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,942
Every cobblestone path I walked,

95
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:57,110
every rickety stairwell I climbed,

96
00:03:57,145 --> 00:03:58,612
the parks, the tunnels...

97
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:00,515
Now it's all gone.

98
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:03,685
Sellitto said you used to play chess.

99
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:06,355
In the park?

100
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:08,956
Now I can't even lift the pawn.

101
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:12,125
You're right.

102
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:19,166
That's hard. Everything's harder.

103
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:25,916
Things you'll probably never do again.

104
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,776
But the ones you can do...

105
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:35,133
Do them, Lincoln.

106
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:39,888
I'll take a rain check on the coffee.

107
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,260
- You do know you work for me?
- I also care about you.

108
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:48,495
And you think I'm not doing enough?

109
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,831
You are. But I see how you look

110
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:53,066
when you're watching Amelia out there

111
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:55,235
where you used to go and walk.
I just think...

112
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:56,570
That I should get out there?

113
00:04:59,026 --> 00:05:00,827
How does that work for you, Claire?

114
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,220
Sellitto is on his way.

115
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,723
Tell me why I should love
this case so much?

116
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:19,192
Josh Marlowe. 17.

117
00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:20,527
Found with a 14 inch cut

118
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,396
of steel rebar drilled through his heart.

119
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,564
I'll go out on a limb. He was murdered.

120
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:27,034
It's not cause of death
that makes this our case.

121
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:28,635
It's where they found him.

122
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,737
Saranac College,

123
00:05:30,772 --> 00:05:32,973
their forensics anthropology site.

124
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:36,009
- Seriously?
- Forensics anthropology site?

125
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,178
A decomp farm.

126
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,348
It's like a playground of forensics.

127
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,183
We use them to study how nature

128
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,651
affects the human body post mortem.

129
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:47,220
A playground of dead bodies?

130
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:48,522
Mm.

131
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,724
They test the effects of everything.

132
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:54,428
Water, heat, sun, insects, time...

133
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:55,929
So that when it happens
to innocent people,

134
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:58,799
we have data to guide us.

135
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,601
Some of my happiest memories
from training were there.

136
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,037
Well, don't look at me like that.

137
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,741
Josh lived in the city.

138
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:10,944
He had no ties
to the university whatsoever,

139
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:12,412
except ending up dead there.

140
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:14,489
So the killers hid the body
amongst a bunch of other bodies.

141
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:17,050
Except there's no hiding
in a decomp farm.

142
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,886
Students and faculty do rounds
all day long.

143
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,689
Document every change and every cadaver.

144
00:06:22,724 --> 00:06:24,691
They know what bodies
are supposed to be there,

145
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:25,902
and what bodies aren't.

146
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:28,128
So either the killer didn't know that,

147
00:06:28,162 --> 00:06:30,297
or they wanted to show off
their handiwork.

148
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:32,599
Either way, we gotta figure out
how a live body

149
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:34,234
ended up in a field full of dead ones.

150
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,969
And by live, he means alive.

151
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:37,804
Took his last breath as they found him.

152
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,906
Now, the chief requested someone

153
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,742
who could investigate this

154
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,777
without harming
their delicate little, uh...

155
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:45,946
Science experiment.

156
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,782
Hey, we might already have
our first lead.

157
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:51,384
Victim's brother says
he might know who did it.

158
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:55,550
Hmm. If we're lucky,

159
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:58,360
the brother's right,
and it's our last lead.

160
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,727
Let's get justice for this family.

161
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,798
You have to get him. Arrest him.

162
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:07,267
- He killed my brother.
- Ray Coyne, your stepfather?

163
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,169
How many people
are you gonna let him kill?

164
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:11,404
Ben, I believe what you're saying.

165
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,173
Okay? And we're listening.

166
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:14,841
We just wanna be armed

167
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:16,143
with everything we know

168
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:18,378
before we talk to your stepfather.

169
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,799
Can you help us with that?

170
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:25,886
Okay, so you asked us,

171
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,807
"How many people
are we gonna let him kill?"

172
00:07:29,357 --> 00:07:30,757
Who else did Ray kill?

173
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:33,460
My mother. Eight go.

174
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,361
I should explain.

175
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:37,164
Ben's mother, Grace, was my best friend.

176
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:39,699
She died from complications
of a heart condition.

177
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:41,501
They said that, but Josh knew

178
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:43,069
Ray did something to her.

179
00:07:43,104 --> 00:07:46,449
- Josh knew based on what?
- He just...

180
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:48,775
Knew.

181
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,444
There were problems in the marriage.

182
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,480
The boy's father passed away
five years ago.

183
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,082
They never liked Ray, never accepted him.

184
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:59,653
When Grace died out of nowhere,
they blamed him.

185
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,054
Because he did it.

186
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:04,491
Ray has custody, but I try and help.

187
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,761
Ben, I wanna help you. You can trust me.

188
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:11,224
You've lost a lot, too much,

189
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:13,967
and I get that. Believe me, I do.

190
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:16,837
So can you tell us,

191
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,874
did Josh have any evidence?

192
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:23,410
He's been trying to get evidence.

193
00:08:23,444 --> 00:08:25,745
- Trying how?
- He wouldn't tell me,

194
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,091
but he said he was getting close.

195
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,683
Ray must have found out
and followed him there.

196
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,219
- To Saranac?
- To the body farm, yeah.

197
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:33,720
I don't understand.

198
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:38,225
Why would your brother
be going to the body farm?

199
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:40,427
That's where our mom's body is.

200
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:46,366
Mother and son dead in the same spot

201
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,268
eight months apart.

202
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:52,005
Interested now?

203
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:58,662
Meet Grace Marlowe, accountant,

204
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,431
dedicated mother of two,
and for the past eight months,

205
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:04,167
resident at the Saranac College
Decomp Farm.

206
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:08,104
Died from complications
of Eisenmenger syndrome.

207
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:10,173
It's brought on
by an atrial septal defect,

208
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,608
a hole in the wall

209
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:12,709
between the top two chambers
of the heart.

210
00:09:12,743 --> 00:09:14,845
Undiagnosed, it can lead
to cardiac arrest,

211
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,646
which is in our cause of death.

212
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,649
Well, alleged cause of death, right?

213
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,384
Official cause of death.

214
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:23,687
Let's not get pulled offsides by two kids

215
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:25,055
who don't like their mother remarrying.

216
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:26,456
Wouldn't be the first murder

217
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:28,325
to be labeled as natural causes,

218
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,893
but you knew that.

219
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:33,697
So Grace dies,
donates her body to science,

220
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:35,866
ends up a research cadaver

221
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,794
rotting in a field
for the better part of a year

222
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,704
until her son comes looking for her,

223
00:09:40,738 --> 00:09:42,405
trying to find evidence she was murdered

224
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,808
and dies 20 yards away from her.

225
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:46,810
What a tragic reunion.

226
00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:48,879
- Like that Paul Simon song.
- Hm?

227
00:09:48,913 --> 00:09:50,714
Paul Simon.

228
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:53,149
He named a song after a dish
at a Chinese restaurant.

229
00:09:53,184 --> 00:09:54,985
Chicken and eggs on the same plate.

230
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,053
Called it the mother and child reunion.

231
00:09:57,287 --> 00:09:58,854
That's clever.

232
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,125
I need you out on the decomp farm

233
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,195
while Sellitto and Eric
run down the wicked stepfather.

234
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,931
As much as I love spending
every day in here,

235
00:10:07,965 --> 00:10:09,933
the decomp farm is
my old stomping ground.

236
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:11,301
I could go with her.

237
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:12,966
She could go instead of me.

238
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:15,138
I need you here with me.

239
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:23,680
Fine. Go.

240
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:26,016
Knock yourself out.

241
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,651
This is gonna be awesome.

242
00:10:36,327 --> 00:10:38,428
I don't know if anyone's
ever told you this, but...

243
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:43,500
You've a mocking tone.

244
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,805
The way you talk to people.

245
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:59,349
You're not a very nice person, Jane.

246
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,986
But you were a good friend to Danielle.

247
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:13,406
Made her feel happy...

248
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,434
which made me feel happy.

249
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,472
We were all happy.

250
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,416
But all good things must come to an end.

251
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:42,726
Quite a before and after.

252
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,495
He was steps away from her.

253
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:48,198
20 yards from finding out
whatever answer he wanted.

254
00:11:48,232 --> 00:11:50,066
The question is:

255
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:51,968
what could Josh have possibly
retrieved here

256
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,169
that would help him?

257
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:54,704
In the elements like this,

258
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:57,033
Grace could've been fully
skeletonized for months now.

259
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:59,709
Amelia, Grace is in good hands with Kate.

260
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:01,111
- We need to examine...
- Josh's crime scene.

261
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:04,047
Yeah. On it.

262
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,856
Oh, rebar.

263
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,491
I think we can safely say

264
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,559
we know the origin of the murder weapon.

265
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:18,228
Which means this wasn't planned.

266
00:12:18,262 --> 00:12:20,196
Our killer had to improvise.

267
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:22,165
Seems like finding evidence

268
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,167
isn't gonna be a problem out here.

269
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,902
Too many needles,

270
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:27,704
not enough haystack.

271
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:30,373
You will find
extraneous evidence, tissue,

272
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:33,943
bone fragments, footprints,
but by process of elimination...

273
00:12:33,978 --> 00:12:36,279
Yeah, look for evidence
that doesn't belong.

274
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:37,514
I got it.

275
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:41,685
Look at the ground inside the site.

276
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,788
It looks damp,
but it doesn't look like blood.

277
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:47,557
Mm, let's sample it.
Check the tarp itself.

278
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:50,026
It's the one thing apart from the rebar

279
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,761
that we know the killer had contact with.

280
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:54,357
Okay.

281
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:57,600
Got something
on the underside of the tarp.

282
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:59,436
- Blood?
- Look, zoom in.

283
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,237
White hair stuck on blood.

284
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:02,772
Sticks out like a bloody thumb.

285
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:04,607
- I'll bag it.
- No.

286
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:07,711
Bring in the whole tarp.
I wanna test it for everything.

287
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,646
Hey, Coyne.

288
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:12,816
Detective Sellitto, Castillo, NYPD.

289
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,570
- I was expecting you.
- Is that right?

290
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,654
I haven't seen or heard from Ben

291
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:19,723
since I went to ID Josh's body.

292
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,459
Melissa told me he wants
to stay with her?

293
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:23,893
Figured it'd be a matter of time

294
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,729
before he told you
what he thinks about me.

295
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,231
What he thinks about you
is quite the accusation.

296
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,434
Oh. He's tragically misinformed,

297
00:13:31,469 --> 00:13:33,503
and it breaks my heart.

298
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:36,740
I loved his mother.

299
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,742
Watching her die,

300
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,678
suddenly, awfully... It nearly killed me.

301
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:45,482
I know they didn't like me
taking their father's place,

302
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:47,352
but to think I could have harmed her?

303
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:52,732
When Grace was sick at the very end,

304
00:13:53,274 --> 00:13:56,159
she didn't want the boys
to remember her like that,

305
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:59,363
so I tried to keep them
from seeing her at her worst.

306
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,075
Josh thought I was hiding something,

307
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,034
- but I got nothing to hide.
- Nothing?

308
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:07,403
Look, I was working
when Josh was murdered.

309
00:14:07,438 --> 00:14:09,272
I'm a security guard. There are logs.

310
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,640
There's video.

311
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:13,009
Very sorry about Josh's death.

312
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:15,211
If you have any information
you think might help

313
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:17,147
or any questions...

314
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:19,616
I have one question.

315
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,846
What Josh thought
about Grace being murdered...

316
00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:26,248
Could that really be true?

317
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:28,404
Is that why this happened?

318
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:33,463
You lock up the stepfather?

319
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,399
Seems there are two sides to every story,

320
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:38,434
which means we still have to do this.

321
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:41,337
- I hate morgues.
- Does anyone like morgues?

322
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:43,206
Kate.

323
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,575
Well, she'll have to enjoy remotely.

324
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:46,976
Lincoln summoned her back

325
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,378
when I interviewed the students.

326
00:14:48,412 --> 00:14:49,712
You get anything?

327
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:51,314
Just the eerie feeling

328
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,715
that they're teaching each
and every one of them

329
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,318
- how to get away with murder.
- Yeah.

330
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,986
I think the idea is to teach them

331
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,655
how to stop people
from getting away with murder.

332
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,924
Now let's get a look at our victim.

333
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,859
The sooner we get out of here,
the better.

334
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:04,695
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

335
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,330
Is it unusual for you, Dr. Wasden?

336
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,465
We never get murder victims here.

337
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,068
Uh, all of our bodies die
of natural causes,

338
00:15:12,102 --> 00:15:15,839
so this is quite exciting...
Professionally speaking.

339
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,073
Totally get it.

340
00:15:17,107 --> 00:15:19,175
And this one is unique.

341
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,377
Mr. Marlowe was impaled from behind

342
00:15:21,412 --> 00:15:23,246
between 2:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m.

343
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,949
The weapon entered
just below the right shoulder

344
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:27,750
before entering the right atrium

345
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:29,319
and rupturing the pulmonic valve.

346
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:31,154
But that's not what killed him.

347
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:33,523
The valve slowly leaked blood
into his lungs,

348
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,891
and he choked to death.

349
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:37,060
He must've suffered for hours.

350
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:38,528
The killer must've been in a hurry

351
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,129
if they left him alive like that.

352
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:41,929
Yeah, I thought the same thing.

353
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:44,701
However, the body was cleaned...
Meticulously cleaned,

354
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,369
swabbed beneath the nails

355
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,904
and on all the defensive wounds.

356
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:49,405
Defensive wounds?

357
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,773
Oh, yes, there was clearly a struggle.

358
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:52,442
He fought back.

359
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:55,411
But I found nothing
transferred from the assailant.

360
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:58,314
Covering up something like that
is no small feat.

361
00:15:58,349 --> 00:16:00,483
So you're saying whoever did this

362
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:02,218
knew exactly what they were doing.

363
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,587
Forensically speaking.

364
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:07,557
Don't like to speculate,
but it's a fair conclusion.

365
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,659
And how many people with
that kind of knowledge

366
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:12,128
also had access
to the decomp farm at night?

367
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:14,364
Well, that would be everyone here.

368
00:16:14,398 --> 00:16:16,432
Maybe a hundred people

369
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:17,867
every semester.

370
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:25,843
Officer Sachs,
someone's been waiting for you.

371
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:30,845
Did you talk to him?

372
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,300
Ben, what are you doing here?

373
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:35,850
I wanna know what Ray said.
I wanna know what you found.

374
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:38,152
Okay, well, we just started,

375
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:41,477
and yes, our people are talking to Ray.

376
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:42,821
- And what'd he say?
- Ben, come on, sit down.

377
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:45,090
No, I'm... I'm not gonna... I can't sit.

378
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,459
Look, Ben, I get
what you're feeling here.

379
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:49,328
No, you don't.

380
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:52,297
My brother's dead. My mother's dead.

381
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:56,457
You're right.

382
00:16:57,303 --> 00:17:00,272
What you're feeling, no one else knows.

383
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:02,608
Okay, no one can understand

384
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:05,778
what that kind of loss feels like.

385
00:17:05,812 --> 00:17:07,679
But here's what I need you to know:

386
00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:10,983
it is my job, Ben, to get you
the answers that you want.

387
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:16,288
Now look, if that means Ray,

388
00:17:16,322 --> 00:17:19,625
I don't know, but I can promise you

389
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:22,428
that I will not stop
until I find something.

390
00:17:23,563 --> 00:17:25,831
Okay? So just sit down.

391
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:31,170
You're not in this alone, Ben.

392
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:35,339
We got your back.

393
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:42,981
You're not gonna tell me what you found?

394
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:46,485
I am when this is done.

395
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,954
- I want to believe you.
- Well, you can.

396
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:51,523
I promise you, I'm telling you the truth.

397
00:18:05,738 --> 00:18:07,739
Wasden's fast.

398
00:18:07,774 --> 00:18:10,509
Toxicology report. Marlowe, Joshua A.

399
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:12,578
No volatiles, no illicits.

400
00:18:12,612 --> 00:18:15,321
Perfectly healthy kid
besides, you know...

401
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:17,883
The stake through the heart.
What about the tarp?

402
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:19,985
The only thing of note was
the hair Amelia found.

403
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:21,086
It's from an Angora.

404
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:22,187
Basically a house cat with white...

405
00:18:22,222 --> 00:18:24,056
I know what an Angora is.

406
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,092
Okay, normally,
this wouldn't be that helpful...

407
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,461
Because all manner of vermin
descend on decomp farms

408
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:30,796
to feast on bodies.

409
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,098
Well, cats aren't technically vermin.

410
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:36,368
Anyway, the position on the
tarp suggests that the hair

411
00:18:36,402 --> 00:18:38,504
was between the tarp and Josh's body.

412
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:40,472
Meaning it was there
before he was covered.

413
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:42,508
Which is why I asked Eric
to check in with Ben.

414
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:43,812
No cat.

415
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:45,099
I think it came from the killer.

416
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:48,280
So we're looking for a killer with a cat.

417
00:18:48,314 --> 00:18:50,015
- Seems to narrow it down.
- It's something!

418
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:51,822
Felix!

419
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:57,189
Could you please use
the button on your chair?

420
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:59,224
I have kind of a thing
about being yelled at.

421
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:00,626
Have you found any connections

422
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,194
between Saranac College and Josh?

423
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:04,096
I'm looking into everyone.
Faculty, staff, students.

424
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,797
You should've been done by now.

425
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:07,330
I'm working on
the Bone Collector footage.

426
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:08,811
I told you to drop that for now.

427
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:10,236
Yeah, you also told me to use
every tool at my disposal.

428
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:13,605
Felix, after you get me what I need.

429
00:19:34,112 --> 00:19:37,214
- He's not himself today.
- No, no, he is.

430
00:19:38,665 --> 00:19:41,767
He's always been Lincoln-y
even before was in that chair.

431
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:44,670
And that's fine.

432
00:19:44,704 --> 00:19:47,586
You know that's okay because he's good.

433
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:49,755
He's better than good.

434
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,578
I mean, I get to do things here
that I would never get to do

435
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:56,148
somewhere else, but sometimes,
it is just not worth it.

436
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,318
Honestly, I can't believe
you'd stick up for him

437
00:19:59,352 --> 00:20:00,719
after the way he talked to you
this morning.

438
00:20:00,753 --> 00:20:04,089
I was pushing him, and he wasn't wrong.

439
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:07,659
I have a condition.

440
00:20:07,694 --> 00:20:09,795
A panic disorder, really.

441
00:20:10,763 --> 00:20:14,233
I can't be in crowds, can't go in public,

442
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:15,968
can't even leave this apartment.

443
00:20:16,002 --> 00:20:18,537
- Agoraphobia.
- I wanna get out.

444
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:21,006
I just can't.

445
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,275
He can, but he doesn't want to.

446
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:26,478
And that sets me off, which sets him off.

447
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:28,213
My two cents?

448
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:29,715
It's got nothing to do with you.

449
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:32,684
His problem is that he lost
to the Bone Collector,

450
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:34,586
and he cannot accept that.

451
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:37,275
You're right.

452
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:40,058
He's not stuck in here,

453
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:42,127
he's stuck in the same place in his life

454
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,801
ever since that night.

455
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:48,100
That's it. Of course.

456
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:51,603
- What?
- Stuck in the same place.

457
00:20:51,638 --> 00:20:53,305
I've been looking at this all wrong.

458
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:54,606
Uh.

459
00:20:58,111 --> 00:21:00,646
Claire, we just might find
the Bone Collector after all.

460
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:08,253
The beauty of chess is, you
never know how many moves ahead

461
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:09,755
your opponent is thinking.

462
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:12,824
So your point is, the same
is true in catching murderers.

463
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:14,459
If Ray Coyne killed his stepson,

464
00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:16,128
was it because he also killed Grace?

465
00:21:16,162 --> 00:21:17,396
He feared exposure?

466
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,031
There's two problems there.

467
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:21,767
There wasn't much left of her
to be exposed,

468
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:24,436
and Sellitto doesn't think Ray
looks good for it.

469
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,038
You wanna know how many
people I've arrested

470
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:27,372
who didn't look good for it?

471
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:29,241
Mm.

472
00:21:29,275 --> 00:21:31,009
You're in high spirits today.

473
00:21:31,044 --> 00:21:32,678
No different than any other day.

474
00:21:32,712 --> 00:21:35,247
No, usually your
mild disdain and impatience

475
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:37,071
are part of your charm.

476
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:40,385
I come in here, and Claire's
walking on eggshells.

477
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,688
Felix is grumbling...

478
00:21:42,722 --> 00:21:45,557
Maybe people should just do their jobs.

479
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:48,226
Maybe they'd do them better
if the work environment

480
00:21:48,261 --> 00:21:50,042
was a little more...

481
00:21:50,797 --> 00:21:52,864
- harmonious.
- Look.

482
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:55,167
I care about catching this killer.

483
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:57,102
I care about finding
what happened to Josh.

484
00:21:57,136 --> 00:21:58,670
If I get impatient...

485
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:02,638
Fine.

486
00:22:03,142 --> 00:22:05,110
I'll try not to get impatient.

487
00:22:05,144 --> 00:22:06,850
Fine.

488
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:09,201
We may have found our man.

489
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:11,850
Stepfather was all broken up
about his wife's death,

490
00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:13,885
only guess what he failed to mention.

491
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,220
A secret girlfriend.

492
00:22:15,254 --> 00:22:17,522
- One of the other great
motives: money.

493
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:19,958
Grace took out a $1/2 million policy

494
00:22:19,992 --> 00:22:21,727
on her life a year before she died.

495
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:23,161
She didn't leave anything to her kids?

496
00:22:23,196 --> 00:22:25,197
She did entrust,

497
00:22:25,231 --> 00:22:27,332
and guess who the trustee is
until they come of age.

498
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:29,735
Josh was about to turn 18.

499
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:32,237
So Ray's share of the money
was about to go away.

500
00:22:32,271 --> 00:22:34,473
Problem is, his alibi holds up.

501
00:22:34,507 --> 00:22:36,808
Maybe because
he's not the one who did it.

502
00:22:36,843 --> 00:22:38,261
This is the file Saranac College

503
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:41,413
gave us on Grace Marlowe.
Seemed pretty thin on evidence,

504
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:43,014
so I decided to check out
a couple of other ones.

505
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:46,151
This one and this one.

506
00:22:46,185 --> 00:22:48,487
All the other files
on decomp farm corpses

507
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:52,357
include reams of info.
Detailed notes, photos...

508
00:22:52,392 --> 00:22:53,692
You're saying someone
was trying to cover up

509
00:22:53,726 --> 00:22:55,026
everything about Grace.

510
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:58,330
No, not just someone. Someone we met.

511
00:22:58,364 --> 00:23:00,499
Autumn Bestin,

512
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:02,323
the TA of the class.

513
00:23:02,358 --> 00:23:04,736
- The one who found the body?
- Yep.

514
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:06,371
She checked out the file three days ago

515
00:23:06,406 --> 00:23:08,440
and emptied it of almost every
single piece of evidence

516
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:09,870
on Grace,

517
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:12,411
then suddenly finds her son's
body two days later?

518
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:15,947
I interviewed Autumn.
She said she didn't know Josh.

519
00:23:15,982 --> 00:23:17,883
Sounds like Autumn lied to you.

520
00:23:28,688 --> 00:23:30,201
I was scared. Who wouldn't be?

521
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:31,918
So you did know Josh Marlowe.

522
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,787
Yes... I mean, barely.

523
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:35,388
I'd known him for a week,

524
00:23:35,423 --> 00:23:37,590
I helped him find information
about his mother,

525
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,559
and there he was. Murdered.

526
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:40,980
And you didn't think mentioning
that would be relevant?

527
00:23:41,014 --> 00:23:42,436
I was freaked out.

528
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:44,864
I've seen bodies, but never a murder.

529
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:47,567
Well, that may seem more plausible

530
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:50,804
if we didn't know you
emptied out his mother's file.

531
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:52,852
No, that's how I found it.

532
00:23:52,886 --> 00:23:55,175
Why were you trying
to get it in the first place?

533
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:57,644
Josh found out his mother
had donated her body here.

534
00:23:57,678 --> 00:23:59,746
He went around to a bunch of faculty.

535
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,181
No one would give him anything.

536
00:24:01,215 --> 00:24:03,216
I mean, they're really not supposed to.

537
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,652
- So why did you?
- I felt awful for him.

538
00:24:05,686 --> 00:24:08,221
His mother had been murdered.
He kept saying her name.

539
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:10,957
I'd overseen her case
when she arrived at the farm.

540
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,192
I remembered the name,

541
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:14,060
so I told him
I would see what I could find.

542
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:16,319
So what did you think
when you found the file?

543
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:20,567
It was unusual,
so I went to the computer.

544
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:22,168
There should've been backups, copies...

545
00:24:22,203 --> 00:24:23,303
Mm-hmm.

546
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,205
Grace Marlowe's file was empty.

547
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,806
Someone erased it.

548
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:29,075
You told Josh this?

549
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:31,978
I did, and I sent him copies
of what little I had,

550
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,546
my personal notes from the time.

551
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:35,815
- Do you still have them?
- I do.

552
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,584
It's not much.

553
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:40,086
A couple of photos,
handwritten descriptions...

554
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:43,799
You think Josh was right.

555
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,176
She was murdered?

556
00:24:46,961 --> 00:24:49,696
And someone killed him
because of what I gave him?

557
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:51,931
Autumn's story checks out.

558
00:24:51,966 --> 00:24:54,434
So Ray has motive, but also an alibi.

559
00:24:54,468 --> 00:24:56,069
Autumn lied to us,

560
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,637
but seems like she wanted
to help find the truth

561
00:24:57,671 --> 00:25:00,206
- about Grace's murder.
- Alleged murder.

562
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,676
Oh, God.

563
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,079
I guess that's what becomes
of us all at some point.

564
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:07,814
Standard Y-shaped incision,

565
00:25:07,848 --> 00:25:10,049
which means they confirmed
the cardiac arrest.

566
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:11,284
Autumn said she took notes.

567
00:25:11,318 --> 00:25:12,919
What else did she observe about the body?

568
00:25:12,953 --> 00:25:16,422
Skin inflammation,
deep creases in the palms,

569
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:18,258
excessive white on her fingernails.

570
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:20,293
Huh, Eisenmenger's syndrome
should have caused

571
00:25:20,327 --> 00:25:22,762
a blue tint in the skin,
not red inflammation.

572
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:24,423
Show me a more recent photo.

573
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:28,167
Zoom in on the sternum.

574
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:40,280
No evidence of bone disease.
And only one chemical

575
00:25:40,314 --> 00:25:42,115
affects skeletal discoloration
post mortem.

576
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:43,650
Arsenic.

577
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:45,518
Changes the bone even after you're dead.

578
00:25:45,553 --> 00:25:47,320
Josh was right.

579
00:25:47,354 --> 00:25:49,289
His mother didn't die of a heart defect.

580
00:25:49,323 --> 00:25:51,691
- She was poisoned.
- And that's not all we pulled.

581
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:53,493
Grace's medical history...

582
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:56,329
She had celiac disease,
which is hereditary.

583
00:25:56,363 --> 00:25:58,074
Even if Josh didn't inherit the disease,

584
00:25:58,108 --> 00:25:59,679
he would've had the antibody deficiency,

585
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:03,770
but in Wasden's tox report?
His numbers are normal.

586
00:26:03,804 --> 00:26:05,939
You're saying the medical
examiner assisting us

587
00:26:05,973 --> 00:26:08,107
on this case falsified
Josh's autopsy report?

588
00:26:08,142 --> 00:26:10,577
I'm saying what I see in the numbers.

589
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:14,414
So, what was Dr. Wasden
trying to hide and why?

590
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,767
What are we not seeing?

591
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,560
Mm.

592
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:20,332
Right there.

593
00:26:20,357 --> 00:26:21,957
We're too busy staring at the results,

594
00:26:21,982 --> 00:26:24,650
we weren't focused on
the signatures at the bottom.

595
00:26:24,858 --> 00:26:26,092
Look who performed

596
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,694
Grace Marlowe's autopsy last year.

597
00:26:27,728 --> 00:26:29,462
Dr. Arthur Wasden.

598
00:26:33,307 --> 00:26:35,642
Detectives! How can I help you?

599
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:38,435
Do you happen to own a cat, Dr. Wasden?

600
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,227
Allergic, I'm afraid.

601
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:42,041
What does this have to do with the case?

602
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:44,677
Why didn't you tell us
that you performed autopsies

603
00:26:44,712 --> 00:26:45,979
on Josh and Grace Marlowe?

604
00:26:46,013 --> 00:26:48,882
Josh Marlowe's mother, Grace.

605
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:50,997
Eight months ago,
you performed the autopsy,

606
00:26:51,022 --> 00:26:53,857
and ruled it death
by congenital heart condition.

607
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,981
I perform a great number of autopsies.

608
00:26:56,006 --> 00:26:58,474
A mother and son.
That didn't strike you as odd?

609
00:26:58,499 --> 00:26:59,870
I wasn't aware.

610
00:26:59,895 --> 00:27:02,025
Well, that's
an interesting detail to miss,

611
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:05,419
considering you're so meticulous.

612
00:27:05,538 --> 00:27:07,839
I'm not sure I appreciate
the tone of this conversation.

613
00:27:07,864 --> 00:27:09,998
Well, you're gonna have
to forgive our impoliteness.

614
00:27:10,023 --> 00:27:13,559
We're just adding up all these
very strange coincidences.

615
00:27:13,584 --> 00:27:15,485
You're the county medical examiner,

616
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,811
but you also run the entire
decomp farm facility,

617
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,403
don't you?

618
00:27:19,428 --> 00:27:22,063
Which gives you access
not only to the entire grounds,

619
00:27:22,088 --> 00:27:24,689
but every single cadaver
that enters those grounds.

620
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:26,748
And all the files kept on them.

621
00:27:26,793 --> 00:27:28,494
We're gonna have a second examiner

622
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:29,986
perform an autopsy on Josh Marlowe.

623
00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:31,812
Which requires a court order.

624
00:27:31,837 --> 00:27:35,440
Or a request from the next of kin.

625
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:40,133
Josh's brother would like us
to take another look.

626
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:42,435
Well, I'm sorry. That's not possible.

627
00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:43,936
It was apparently

628
00:27:43,971 --> 00:27:45,738
a terrible miscommunication
with my staff.

629
00:27:46,356 --> 00:27:48,074
Josh's body has been cremated.

630
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,122
Last one.

631
00:28:03,157 --> 00:28:04,857
Have you seen my journals?

632
00:28:06,593 --> 00:28:08,795
- Really?
- Really.

633
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:10,563
- You jerk.
- Hmm.

634
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,333
Why does packing
always take twice as long

635
00:28:14,368 --> 00:28:15,668
as you think it's going to?

636
00:28:15,703 --> 00:28:18,071
Yeah. Just think,

637
00:28:18,105 --> 00:28:20,506
a few days from now,
we get to do it all backwards.

638
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:22,975
Mm, don't pretend you're not excited.

639
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,644
I am.

640
00:28:24,678 --> 00:28:25,978
Yeah.

641
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:27,513
Why don't you check on the movers?

642
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:29,048
Okay.

643
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,683
I'm gonna take one last look around,

644
00:28:30,718 --> 00:28:32,318
make sure we're not forgetting anything.

645
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:33,720
You are being paranoid.

646
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,155
- I'm being...
- Thorough.

647
00:29:01,885 --> 00:29:05,451
Wait, how is it even legal
for an ME to examine a body

648
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,819
near his own office?

649
00:29:06,853 --> 00:29:09,154
He's the county medical examiner.

650
00:29:09,189 --> 00:29:10,689
Most counties don't even have one.

651
00:29:10,724 --> 00:29:12,024
They rely on local physicians.

652
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:13,826
Well, they're gonna have
to find a new one.

653
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,294
Listen, if I were a betting man,

654
00:29:15,328 --> 00:29:16,762
all my chips would be on Wasden,

655
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,664
but we can't arrest him.

656
00:29:18,698 --> 00:29:19,998
He took our only potential evidence

657
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:22,501
and stuck it in an 1,800 degree furnace.

658
00:29:22,535 --> 00:29:24,369
Well, listen to this.

659
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:27,372
In 2004, Dr. Arthur Wasden
was forced into rehab

660
00:29:27,407 --> 00:29:28,774
for opioid abuse.

661
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,543
2006, filed for bankruptcy.

662
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:33,825
Then gets sued
because of a deceased woman

663
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:36,348
whose organs were, I kid you not,

664
00:29:36,382 --> 00:29:38,552
mistakenly removed for donation.

665
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:42,114
Settled out of court.

666
00:29:42,139 --> 00:29:43,740
So he doesn't have glowing Yelp reviews.

667
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:45,065
Doesn't give motive.

668
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,424
But he does have the skills
to hide evidence

669
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:48,883
on both bodies.

670
00:29:48,908 --> 00:29:50,609
Yes, but why kill Josh at all?

671
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,330
Why kill his mother?

672
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:53,822
Apart from doing their autopsies,

673
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:55,882
Wasden has no connection to them at all.

674
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,195
He might.

675
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,821
Grace was an accountant, remember?

676
00:29:58,846 --> 00:30:00,246
The firm she worked for,

677
00:30:00,271 --> 00:30:01,771
they took on extra work
during the tax season,

678
00:30:01,796 --> 00:30:04,964
and one of the accounts
they worked... Saranac College.

679
00:30:11,785 --> 00:30:14,620
So what? The coroner's office
just accidentally cremated a body

680
00:30:14,654 --> 00:30:15,788
in an unsolved murder case?

681
00:30:15,822 --> 00:30:17,089
Doesn't that sound weird to you?

682
00:30:17,123 --> 00:30:19,158
It does, it does,

683
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,493
and we are going to figure out
what happened,

684
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,895
I promise you,

685
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:25,724
which is why I have a few more questions.

686
00:30:25,898 --> 00:30:30,034
Did Josh ever mention a Dr. Wasden?

687
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,838
He was the man who did
your mother's autopsy.

688
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,274
Why?

689
00:30:34,534 --> 00:30:36,735
He had something to do
with this, didn't he?

690
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,677
Right now, we just don't know.

691
00:30:41,414 --> 00:30:43,115
- Ben!
- He'll be okay.

692
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,255
And what about you?

693
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,224
I'll be fine.

694
00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:53,959
I'm just worried about Ben.

695
00:30:53,993 --> 00:30:55,420
I mean...

696
00:30:56,363 --> 00:31:01,100
does the name Arthur Wasden
mean anything to you?

697
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:04,803
Not that I can recall. Why?

698
00:31:04,838 --> 00:31:06,271
Well, you and Grace worked together

699
00:31:06,306 --> 00:31:07,772
for Saranac College, right?

700
00:31:07,797 --> 00:31:09,164
You both did the books for them?

701
00:31:09,189 --> 00:31:10,523
Yeah, that's why she chose the program

702
00:31:10,548 --> 00:31:12,182
to donate her body to.

703
00:31:12,312 --> 00:31:14,648
Obviously, she didn't think
it would happen so soon.

704
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,255
So if Grace had any old notes or files,

705
00:31:18,518 --> 00:31:20,052
any idea where they may be?

706
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,545
Any way to log in to her accounts?

707
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,772
No, I'm sure they shut down
access when she died.

708
00:31:27,026 --> 00:31:29,161
I'm really sorry. I wish I could help.

709
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,801
I'll be damned.

710
00:31:35,835 --> 00:31:37,736
The one clue we're looking for

711
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,605
literally just walked right up to us.

712
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:41,974
- You have a cat?
- Oh.

713
00:31:42,008 --> 00:31:44,576
Not really.
It's just a neighborhood stray.

714
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,882
I fed her once,

715
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:48,109
and now she comes in and out
like she owns the place.

716
00:31:48,134 --> 00:31:50,469
Wait, are we really saying
she killed her best friend

717
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:51,761
and her best friend's son?

718
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,480
- Everything okay?
- Mia, get out of there.

719
00:31:55,505 --> 00:31:56,906
Yeah, no, I'm a... um...

720
00:31:56,931 --> 00:31:58,932
Let us get enough evidence for a warrant.

721
00:31:58,957 --> 00:32:00,391
I just realized something.

722
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:04,085
You worked on
the Saranac College accounts

723
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,008
with Grace, didn't you?

724
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:08,634
Amelia, what are you doing?

725
00:32:08,668 --> 00:32:09,834
What do you mean?

726
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:11,803
Your company's records will show

727
00:32:11,838 --> 00:32:14,973
that you do know Dr. Wasden.

728
00:32:15,008 --> 00:32:17,210
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

729
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,471
So whatever you
and Dr. Wasden were doing...

730
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:24,082
You and Grace must've been
really good friends,

731
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:27,310
because she confronted you
instead of turning you in,

732
00:32:27,335 --> 00:32:32,573
and you repaid that kindness
by poisoning her?

733
00:32:32,598 --> 00:32:34,899
Then you must've regretted it.

734
00:32:34,924 --> 00:32:36,896
That's why you watch out for the boys.

735
00:32:38,197 --> 00:32:40,832
Until, of course, Josh
got too close to the truth.

736
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:42,367
I want you to leave.

737
00:32:42,402 --> 00:32:44,303
Amelia, we don't have enough
to detain her.

738
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,305
You'd be better served
to look for that cat

739
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,606
so we can match the hair.

740
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,777
I am not leaving her here with Ben.

741
00:32:51,811 --> 00:32:53,378
Who are you talking to?

742
00:32:53,413 --> 00:32:57,149
Ben. Ben!

743
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,584
Weapon!

744
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:01,219
I am not counting to three, Melissa.

745
00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:04,174
Drop the knife.

746
00:33:04,757 --> 00:33:06,024
Drop the knife.

747
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,060
Don't make me have to shoot you.

748
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:09,561
Drop it!

749
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,297
Hands behind your head.

750
00:33:12,665 --> 00:33:14,766
Think we have enough to detain her now?

751
00:33:14,801 --> 00:33:16,201
Oh, my God.

752
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:27,451
Any sign of Ben?

753
00:33:27,476 --> 00:33:29,310
We just got off the phone with Ray Coyne.

754
00:33:29,335 --> 00:33:30,869
Ben was there 15 minutes ago.

755
00:33:30,894 --> 00:33:32,461
He told Ray he was sorry,

756
00:33:32,486 --> 00:33:34,020
said he found out it was
someone at Saranac College

757
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,512
that killed Josh.

758
00:33:35,537 --> 00:33:37,238
Ray went to call off work,
and when he came back,

759
00:33:37,263 --> 00:33:38,797
Ben was gone.

760
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:40,258
Took his truck and his gun.

761
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:43,428
Oh, God.

762
00:33:43,463 --> 00:33:45,097
I mentioned Wasden to Ben.

763
00:33:45,131 --> 00:33:46,732
I mean... he asked me
if he was a suspect.

764
00:33:46,766 --> 00:33:48,066
You didn't tell him
that we like him for it?

765
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:49,334
No, of course not.

766
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:51,036
Look, if he is headed to Saranac,

767
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,647
we need to get there before
Ben makes a huge mistake.

768
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:56,074
And another body ends up on that field.

769
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:04,439
That's Ray's truck,
and that must be Wasden's car.

770
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:07,108
- They're in there somewhere.
- Well, we have to find him.

771
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:09,211
We can't let Ben get to Wasden.

772
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:11,346
All right, fan out.
Backup will be here any minute.

773
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:19,387
Deep breaths. Stay alert.

774
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:32,634
Jeez.

775
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:35,670
You got anything?

776
00:34:35,705 --> 00:34:37,739
Nothing moving.

777
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,282
They're entering the
confined location area now.

778
00:34:47,316 --> 00:34:48,583
What does that mean?

779
00:34:48,618 --> 00:34:51,219
Decomp farms store bodies
anyplace they can.

780
00:34:51,254 --> 00:34:53,288
Submerged underwater, in car trunks,

781
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:54,687
stuffed in barrels.

782
00:34:54,722 --> 00:34:56,057
Lots of places to hide.

783
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,043
Great.

784
00:34:58,077 --> 00:34:59,228
Go back.

785
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,031
Blue car. Glass.

786
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:05,211
There's condensation
on the driver's side window.

787
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,337
Oh, someone's inside.

788
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,773
NYPD! Get out of the vehicle

789
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:13,175
and put your hands where I can see them!

790
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,077
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

791
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,015
- He's behind you!
- Ben!

792
00:35:19,049 --> 00:35:20,249
No.

793
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,096
Don't pull that trigger.

794
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,521
You don't wanna do this. Trust me.

795
00:35:29,526 --> 00:35:31,627
Okay. I'm putting my gun away.

796
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,195
- Amelia!
- See?

797
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,964
Out of the way.

798
00:35:34,998 --> 00:35:37,066
- He killed my brother.
- No!

799
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,202
No, Ben, Dr. Wasden
did not kill your brother.

800
00:35:40,237 --> 00:35:42,338
You're lying. You're just saying that

801
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:43,873
- so I won't shoot him.
- No, I promise you.

802
00:35:43,907 --> 00:35:46,175
He didn't kill your brother.

803
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:48,004
He didn't kill your mom, either.

804
00:35:48,645 --> 00:35:50,346
Then who did?

805
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,460
Just put the gun down.

806
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,117
Then we can talk about it.

807
00:35:55,845 --> 00:35:56,953
Okay?

808
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:58,888
I don't think you wanna shoot me.

809
00:35:59,518 --> 00:36:00,752
Come on.

810
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:02,325
Put it down.

811
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:03,859
Easy, Ben.

812
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:05,628
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Good job.

813
00:36:05,662 --> 00:36:07,129
Good job.

814
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:11,434
Okay, it's over now.

815
00:36:11,468 --> 00:36:13,603
Okay?

816
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:15,271
It's okay.

817
00:36:15,305 --> 00:36:17,740
Not very smart, doctor.
Put your hands up.

818
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:29,151
Melissa was the one who poisoned Grace.

819
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,553
Doesn't make any sense.

820
00:36:30,587 --> 00:36:33,556
Grace discovered Melissa and Dr. Wasden

821
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,891
were embezzling from the college.

822
00:36:35,926 --> 00:36:38,828
He talked her through how to do it,

823
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:42,565
and how to make it look
like she just died.

824
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:45,101
When Josh got too close
to figuring it out,

825
00:36:45,135 --> 00:36:46,787
Melissa had to stop him.

826
00:36:46,822 --> 00:36:49,105
She must've followed him
out there, they had a fight...

827
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:51,907
- That was her too?
- She panicked,

828
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:53,509
called Wasden.

829
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:55,488
He talked her through covering it up.

830
00:36:59,387 --> 00:37:00,754
I thought it was you.

831
00:37:02,537 --> 00:37:04,286
I'm sorry. I'm just...

832
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:07,923
Sorry.

833
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:10,359
All I ever wanted to do
was to be a father to you.

834
00:37:13,063 --> 00:37:14,897
I want you to come home, Ben.

835
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,801
I'd like that.

836
00:37:24,574 --> 00:37:26,254
What's that?

837
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:28,244
Your case, wrapped up,

838
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:29,545
with a bow on it.

839
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:31,781
- You actually put a bow on it?
- Yes.

840
00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:33,315
Yes, I did.

841
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,451
You actually went to a store,
bought a bow,

842
00:37:35,485 --> 00:37:37,086
and put it on a homicide case file.

843
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,698
I have bows at home.

844
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,785
Two homicides, by the way.

845
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:46,080
Sellitto finalized the
paperwork on both confessions.

846
00:37:46,622 --> 00:37:48,690
These are just the forensics
finally adding up.

847
00:37:48,715 --> 00:37:50,382
They always do.

848
00:37:50,493 --> 00:37:51,669
Eventually.

849
00:37:56,032 --> 00:37:57,533
Thank you, by the way,

850
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:58,934
for letting me go out in the field.

851
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:02,891
- Felt like old times.
- Of course.

852
00:38:11,014 --> 00:38:12,398
Claire?

853
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:14,996
Yes?

854
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,283
I don't do apologies well.

855
00:38:23,526 --> 00:38:25,127
You don't do them at all.

856
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,463
So we can skip to the part

857
00:38:27,497 --> 00:38:29,298
where you know I didn't mean what I said?

858
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:32,134
We could,

859
00:38:32,168 --> 00:38:34,236
or we could just jump to the part

860
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,638
where we realize that my job
is to take care of you

861
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:39,074
and not to push you.

862
00:38:39,592 --> 00:38:41,177
Sometimes...

863
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,313
those are the same thing, aren't they?

864
00:38:47,016 --> 00:38:48,484
Fred Hawkins,

865
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:51,420
our nauseatingly pleasant
firefighter friend.

866
00:38:53,156 --> 00:38:54,567
Still have his number?

867
00:39:05,235 --> 00:39:08,170
New York is famously inaccessible.

868
00:39:08,204 --> 00:39:10,572
Only half the subway stops
have elevators.

869
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:13,175
There's traffic, cobblestone streets.

870
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:17,479
Tourists.

871
00:39:19,215 --> 00:39:21,683
But everything can be navigated.

872
00:39:21,718 --> 00:39:25,888
And sometimes, you
just gotta ask for help.

873
00:39:25,922 --> 00:39:28,157
This may come as a surprise.

874
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:30,325
While I may be amazing
at a lot of things,

875
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,427
asking for help is not one of them.

876
00:39:34,397 --> 00:39:36,798
Yeah, that's not surprising at all.

877
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,519
How do we do this?

878
00:39:57,554 --> 00:40:00,255
Well, I could
painstakingly move each piece

879
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,857
with a pointer stick,

880
00:40:01,891 --> 00:40:03,926
or we could...

881
00:40:06,095 --> 00:40:08,530
- Ask for help.
- Right.

882
00:40:08,565 --> 00:40:10,065
Not your comfort zone.

883
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,836
William, do you think you
could move these pieces for us?

884
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,505
Of course.

885
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,899
Thank you.

886
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,577
All right.

887
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:24,746
How about pawn to E4?

888
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:30,619
It's your move.

889
00:40:42,098 --> 00:40:43,999
Felix.

890
00:40:45,134 --> 00:40:46,427
He's back.

891
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:49,153
- How did it go?
- I beat him in seven moves.

892
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,893
You said you have something
on the Bone Collector.

893
00:40:55,478 --> 00:40:57,813
So I looked into the phone
the Bone Collector used

894
00:40:57,847 --> 00:41:00,649
in the surveillance footage.
Even isolating the signal,

895
00:41:00,683 --> 00:41:02,460
I can't trace the number back
to a person.

896
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:04,820
But you're saying you were
able to isolate the signal?

897
00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:06,688
Um... all right.

898
00:41:06,723 --> 00:41:10,559
First hit? Farmington, New Mexico.

899
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,428
- Our man in the mirror.
- The mail drop.

900
00:41:13,463 --> 00:41:15,897
Next up, we got Norman, Oklahoma.

901
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:19,034
Chesterfield, Missouri.
Springfield, Illinois.

902
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:22,471
Columbus, Ohio. Quakertown, PA.

903
00:41:22,505 --> 00:41:24,406
I think we can safely extrapolate

904
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,575
where this path is heading.

905
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,278
To the greatest city in the world.

906
00:41:29,312 --> 00:41:32,047
And to start the game all over again.

907
00:41:42,725 --> 00:41:44,159
It's good to be home.

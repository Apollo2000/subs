1
00:00:04,178 --> 00:00:06,310
- Previously on
"Lincoln Rhyme"...

2
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:08,138
Maybe people should
just do their jobs.

3
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:09,922
- Maybe they'd do them better

4
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:13,404
if their work environment
was a little more harmonious.

5
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:15,189
- Lincoln, wait for backup.

6
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:16,494
- He's always been Lincoln-y,

7
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:18,409
even before he was
in that chair.

8
00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:21,021
His problem is that he lost
to the Bone Collector,

9
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:22,631
and he cannot accept that.

10
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:24,763
- Dad?
- If I go after him again...

11
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:27,288
- We're thousands of miles
away, Lincoln.

12
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:28,680
- Rachel's gonna find out.

13
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:31,205
Make sure she hears
it from you first.

14
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,729
- I looked into the phone
the Bone Collector used

15
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:35,035
in the surveillance footage.

16
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:36,036
I think we can safely
extrapolate

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,646
where this path is heading.

18
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:39,256
- To the greatest
city in the world.

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,084
- It's good to be home.

20
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:51,181
- Profile by
Laura S. Cutter, FBI.

21
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:54,358
Our suspect
is likely a white male.

22
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:56,491
30s to early 50s.

23
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:00,886
A uniquely organized killer.

24
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:06,457
- He's killed 15 victims,

25
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,329
both male and female,

26
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:11,071
across racial
and socioeconomic lines.

27
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:16,250
He sees victims
as unworthy objects.

28
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:28,566
- Even his name,
the Bone Collector,

29
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,614
is coined from his own
disrespect of humanity.

30
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:36,139
Unlike Bundy,
Dahmer, or Gacy,

31
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:39,055
he doesn't seem to derive
any sexual pleasure

32
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,623
or physical thrill
from the violence itself.

33
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:45,627
It's about the control.

34
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,150
He doesn't hide his crimes.

35
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:49,413
He displays them
with great effort

36
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:52,677
to engage the police
in the process

37
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:58,770
the game, whereby he will show
he is better than us,

38
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:01,251
that he wins...

39
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,035
that he's the best.

40
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,952
This...is about ego.

41
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:08,476
- What's about ego?

42
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:12,175
What are you doing up?
It's, like, 5:00 a.m.

43
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:14,482
What? You can't tell me?

44
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:16,832
- Nothing.

45
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,660
You know, it's...

46
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:22,446
just another one
of Lincoln's old cases.

47
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,534
- Okay.

48
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,057
Well, then tell him
it can wait.

49
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:26,537
- I'll try that.

50
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,800
If there's anything
Lincoln loves,

51
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:29,758
it's waiting.

52
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:33,109
- Kay.

53
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:41,857
- Hey. Everything okay?

54
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,641
- It's time.

55
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:44,990
He's back.

56
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:45,991
- Really?

57
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:47,079
I mean,

58
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:48,472
it's him for sure?

59
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:49,995
- A murder was reported
an hour ago

60
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,823
at a library across town.

61
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,651
Evidence displayed
deliberately.

62
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:56,567
Victim left in an apparatus
which led to his demise...

63
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:00,005
Holding a copy of my book.

64
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:03,574
Sellitto and Eric
are already there.

65
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:04,532
- I see.

66
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:06,490
- The first of three victims.

67
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:08,405
Which means if we don't
move fast,

68
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:10,277
two more
innocent people die today

69
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,409
and he disappears again.

70
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:14,498
- Right. Kill and retreat.

71
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:16,500
- He's in New York
for one reason:

72
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,633
to play his game with me.

73
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:20,504
You're my eyes and ears,
Amelia.

74
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:23,768
I need you out there right now.

75
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:25,814
- Lincoln...

76
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:29,034
if he's back
and he knows where we are

77
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:30,427
- I need your
head in the game right now.

78
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:32,473
Your full mind.

79
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:33,865
So a personal security guard
is already on his way

80
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:35,084
to your place.

81
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,172
He's Special Forces.

82
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,956
He's good.

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,871
And believe me,

84
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:42,178
no one is getting near
your sister today.

85
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,703
- Thank you, Lincoln.

86
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:47,705
- No. You can thank me by
getting to that crime scene.

87
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:49,490
- Yeah.
On my way.

88
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:53,233
- The game's already begun.

89
00:03:58,499 --> 00:03:59,978
- There's no ID.

90
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:02,198
We need to figure out
who this victim is.

91
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,373
- I know who he is.

92
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:04,461
- Wait. What?

93
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:05,549
- Dr. Robert Banks.

94
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:07,377
Professor of U.S. history
at CUNY.

95
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,336
My alma mater.

96
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,947
Only person ever
to flunk me in a class.

97
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,992
History, of all things.

98
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:15,864
Made me study out of spite.

99
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:18,083
Became my mentor.

100
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:19,998
Put me on a path to all this.

101
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:23,306
- I'm so sorry, Lincoln.

102
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,394
- Me too.

103
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:28,180
Make sure I speak to
his family when this is over.

104
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:30,574
Right now, there are three
clues left here for us.

105
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:32,446
We need them
to save the next victim.

106
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:37,625
I see a few of them.

107
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:39,627
- The victim regurgitated
something on himself.

108
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,106
Maybe that's our third.

109
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,065
- I'm gonna talk to
the building manager,

110
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:44,588
figure out how on Earth
someone managed

111
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:46,242
to get this body down here
to play mad scientist.

112
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,462
And nobody saw nothing?

113
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:02,258
He reeks.
- Vomit tends to.

114
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,390
- Of alcohol.

115
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:04,434
- Did your professor drink?

116
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:05,740
- Not like this.

117
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:08,482
He always liked
perfect control of his mind.

118
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:10,179
- I see why you
two got along.

119
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:15,271
- What's in the IV?

120
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,665
- Well, it's not your
typical saline solution.

121
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,842
It's something called
tetrodotoxin.

122
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,368
- It's a neurotoxin
found in pufferfish.

123
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:28,153
Intravenous injection
would have paralyzed him.

124
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:32,027
If liquor were poured down
his throat, he couldn't move.

125
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,289
- And without a gag reflex

126
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,552
or the ability to cough up
the alcohol,

127
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:36,988
he would gradually drown.

128
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:39,556
- He was paralyzed.
- We've established that.

129
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,386
- No. I mean this entire scene
is aimed at you, Lincoln.

130
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,475
Your professor.

131
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,042
Your book.

132
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:48,478
Paralysis.

133
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:50,306
- Like I said,
this gets personal.

134
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:58,358
Little early for video games.

135
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,185
- Naia, I have to ask you.

136
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,492
Where's Camden?

137
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:03,972
- At basketball camp.

138
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:06,627
- Since when is he
playing basketball?

139
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,369
- Since a few months ago
when he made the AAU team.

140
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:12,415
- Competitive basketball, and
no one thought to mention this?

141
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,418
- Maybe he was...

142
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:17,551
protecting your feelings?

143
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:19,291
Knowing he can't
shoot hoops with his dad.

144
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:21,293
- Naia,
please listen carefully.

145
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:22,686
I need you to pick him up.

146
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,472
I'm sending someone to
watch your place.

147
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:27,125
- So he's back.

148
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:28,605
- He's in New York.

149
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:30,259
He won't be anywhere near you,
at least not today,

150
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:32,043
but I'm not taking any chances.

151
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,916
Please get Camden?

152
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,787
- I will.

153
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:38,572
Be careful, Lincoln.

154
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:42,924
- I will.

155
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:01,638
.

156
00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:03,510
- The library.

157
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:05,250
Surveillance?

158
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:06,687
Witnesses?

159
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,776
I can't imagine he just
walked in the front door.

160
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,255
- Side door.

161
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:12,214
And there was a power surge
just before closing time.

162
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:14,782
All systems, including
the limited security footage,

163
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:17,306
went dark for ten minutes.

164
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:19,439
- And no witnesses, per usual.

165
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,876
Your professor was alone,
apparently.

166
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,399
Staying late grading papers.

167
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,315
- "There's always work to
be done," he used to say.

168
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,230
- I'll get the unis
to circle back

169
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:29,361
with the properties
on that block,

170
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:31,233
see if anyone
or their security cam

171
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:32,800
saw anything
before the blackout.

172
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:34,279
- I'll check with
the university,

173
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:36,064
get the professor's
schedule from yesterday.

174
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,022
- While you're at it, run
anyone I mentioned by name

175
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,502
in my book.

176
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:41,722
If they're in the city,
send a uni as a precaution.

177
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,201
- Let's go.

178
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,382
- Why do you think he
left a copy of your book?

179
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:52,776
- You said it.
This is about me.

180
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,735
- This time is different.

181
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:56,258
- Is it?

182
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:57,564
He's been playing
this game with me

183
00:07:57,607 --> 00:07:59,261
since I figured out
his three-clue pattern

184
00:07:59,304 --> 00:08:00,741
the night
of the very first murders.

185
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:03,178
- Maybe he's been playing
with you, but up until today,

186
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:05,659
the victims weren't about you,
the clues weren't about you.

187
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:06,747
- What are you saying?

188
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,444
- I am saying he's
changing the rules.

189
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,924
- Well, he doesn't
change the rules.

190
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:10,925
- Then why the book?

191
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:12,404
- I don't know.

192
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:14,189
What I do know is there are
two victims we can find

193
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:15,582
by triangulating the clues.

194
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,888
The dollar bill,
the stomach contents,

195
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:19,455
and whatever
that white fragment is.

196
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,544
Those are his rules.
That's what we focus on.

197
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,767
Amelia, you've got
a terrible poker face.

198
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,898
Just say what's on your mind.

199
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,118
- Okay.

200
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:33,382
Maybe the game itself
is the problem.

201
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,210
Hmm?
It's always the same.

202
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:36,603
He throws.
You swing.

203
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:38,343
- If we don't play
the game, people die.

204
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,302
- 15. I know.
16, if we

205
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:41,912
- I'm aware of the score.

206
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:43,479
- Look, I am sorry.

207
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,788
I'm just saying,
you are always on defense.

208
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,836
Have you ever thought
about going on offense?

209
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,317
- I've been thinking about
this for eight years,

210
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,319
three of them
stuck in this chair.

211
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:59,495
We've tried every way.

212
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,192
Playing his game
is the only way

213
00:09:01,236 --> 00:09:03,194
we've ever gotten close to him.

214
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:04,674
We just have to win.

215
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:05,719
- Okay.

216
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,680
I'm sure you're right.

217
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:19,646
- Agent Cutter?

218
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:22,605
Officer Lincoln Rhyme.
You asked to see me.

219
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,259
- So you're the
dog with the bone,

220
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,826
flooding my inbox every day

221
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:27,479
with your thoughts

222
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:29,438
on the FBI's approach
to the Tourist Killer.

223
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:31,005
- Not trying to step on toes.

224
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,094
I've just been
following the case.

225
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:35,052
Want to help.

226
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:37,054
- Well,

227
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,404
your instincts were correct.

228
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:42,103
The last victim had salt water
on the clothes and her luggage,

229
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:43,887
and so did this one.

230
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:45,062
How did you know?

231
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,281
- If they took the ferry
on the Hudson,

232
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:47,761
like I suspect,

233
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,589
the spray from the river would
track on their clothes.

234
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:53,723
All right then.

235
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,333
Can you explain these fragments

236
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:58,032
found on the victim's hair
and feet?

237
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,384
- The killer's hunting ground
could be

238
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:04,125
any one of a half dozen
tourist areas

239
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:05,779
by the Hudson.

240
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:09,217
Only one would explain
the Torrey's rush flower;

241
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,003
a leaf from New Jersey's
state tree, the red oak;

242
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,788
and what I'm guessing
is a feather

243
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:17,704
from the endangered
northern harrier.

244
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:20,097
Liberty State Park
in New Jersey.

245
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,578
Your killer could be a visitor,

246
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,189
even pose as a tourist himself.

247
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,104
- You think he selects
his targets there?

248
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,584
- Someone innocuous

249
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,586
who crosses paths with
hundreds of tourists a day,

250
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,588
willing to divulge
their vacation plans

251
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,764
to a complete but totally
harmless stranger,

252
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:37,114
then tracks them
to their hotel rooms,

253
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:38,507
where they're taken from.

254
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,163
But...that would
be speculating.

255
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:45,383
All the evidence says
for sure is...

256
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:48,299
this is where you'll find them.

257
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:52,086
- It's quite the theory,
Officer Rhyme.

258
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:54,044
But none of that
fits our profile.

259
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:58,527
- Got it.
- Music to my ears.

260
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,050
- Victim's vomit
is mostly whiskey

261
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,225
a New York rye

262
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:03,619
except for a few
undigested particles

263
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,099
of turtle meat.

264
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:07,057
- Turtle meat?
- How aristocratic.

265
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:08,711
- And inhumane.

266
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:10,452
Green sea turtles
are endangered.

267
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:12,149
It is illegal to eat one
in the United States.

268
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:13,281
- We'll be sure to add that

269
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:14,891
at the Bone Collector's
sentencing.

270
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,501
In the meantime,

271
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:18,765
I doubt Professor Banks was
dining on exotic reptile meat

272
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,244
while grading papers.

273
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:22,116
It's a clue.

274
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,117
What about that white tile?

275
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,205
- Not a tile.

276
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:25,467
It's ivory.

277
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,860
From a hippopotamus tusk.

278
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:28,383
- Hippos have tusks?

279
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:29,427
- And the dollar?

280
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,212
- It's just that.
One dollar.

281
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:32,822
Nothing telling
from the serial number.

282
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:34,955
Professor's prints are on it.
Probably came from his wallet.

283
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:36,304
- What about my book?

284
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:37,653
- It came from right
off that library shelf.

285
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,611
- Wiped of all prints,
of course.

286
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:43,790
- Let's take these clues
at face value.

287
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,836
One dollar bill,

288
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,838
turtle meat,

289
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:50,753
and ivory.

290
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:54,757
It's a common misconception

291
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,933
that Washington
had wooden teeth.

292
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,369
In fact,

293
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:00,894
his dentures were
made from hippo ivory.

294
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:04,506
In 1783, Washington hosted
a farewell turtle feast

295
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:07,204
for the officers of the
Continental Army,

296
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:08,597
removing his hippo dentures

297
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,251
so he could enjoy
a decadent meal

298
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:12,296
at what is now the oldest
operating bar

299
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,386
in New York City.

300
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,477
The next victim is
at Fraunces Tavern.

301
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,045
- All available units
to Fraunces Tavern.

302
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,798
- Hey.
How was the seminar?

303
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:37,452
- I did my four words
routine

304
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:39,584
you know, organize,
plan, commit, succeed

305
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,761
and I got a standing
ovation at the end.

306
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:44,676
- Because you organized
and planned it so well?

307
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,287
Cute.

308
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,334
But really,
it was invigorating.

309
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:52,032
How's your work coming?

310
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,642
- Oh, you know,

311
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:56,732
somewhere between committed
and succeeding.

312
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:02,477
Hey, I'm proud of you.

313
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,480
Why don't we do lunch
at the Weybridge?

314
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:08,396
Celebrate the life coach
who changed my life.

315
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:09,963
- I love it.

316
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:12,400
And just so you hear me
say it, you were right.

317
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:16,056
Coming back to New York
was a great idea.

318
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,884
- I think so too.

319
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,494
Love you.

320
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:21,888
- Love you, too, honey.

321
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:56,052
.

322
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,059
It was horrible.

323
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:05,714
His face was justoh, my God!

324
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:08,499
- Looks like we're too late.

325
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:09,892
- I can talk to her.

326
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:11,459
You're needed inside.

327
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,984
- Nobody's allowed in
without proper equipment.

328
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:16,203
It's not safe.

329
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:17,291
- What are you talking about?

330
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:18,640
- The kitchen's
a gas chamber.

331
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:19,902
Someone unscrewed all
the carbon dioxide tanks

332
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:20,903
from the taps.

333
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,123
- Let me guess.

334
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,907
You want me to
go in anyway.

335
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,300
- You set the bar high

336
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:28,998
by standing in front
of a moving subway train.

337
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:30,434
- Let's get you suited up.

338
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:35,004
Listen, if you feel a headache
or dizzy or confused

339
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,964
anything
you get the hell out.

340
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:39,443
- I work with Lincoln Rhyme.

341
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:41,532
When am I not confused
with a headache?

342
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,798
- Good luck.

343
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:03,337
- Amelia, relax.

344
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,078
Forget about
the stakes for a second.

345
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,950
Only think about what's
right in front of you.

346
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,691
- Are you seeing what's
right in front of me?

347
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:11,345
- You can do this.

348
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:13,434
Now, I need you
to turn around

349
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:14,826
and tell me
what's in the victim's hand.

350
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:20,528
- Uh...

351
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:24,967
it's your book...again.

352
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,229
Did you know this victim too?

353
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:29,493
- I don't, but just in case,
check his ID.

354
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:48,817
Hey.

355
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,253
He's not in your book.

356
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:51,646
- Collateral damage,
I'm afraid,

357
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:52,908
just like the rest.

358
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:00,133
Oh!

359
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,091
I found one of the clues!

360
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,139
- There should be two more.

361
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:07,967
Where are they?

362
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,753
Oh, wait a minute.

363
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:12,754
Look at his mouth.

364
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:15,757
- What do you want me to do?

365
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,150
- Very gently hold onto it

366
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:18,760
while you open his jaw.

367
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:23,417
Okay.

368
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:30,076
Okay.

369
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,654
Are you seeing this?

370
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:45,352
It looks like it goes
down his throat.

371
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:46,266
- Yes.

372
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:47,267
There should be two more clues

373
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,485
at the other end
of that string.

374
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:51,619
- Okay, so this'll be
a forensics thing,

375
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:52,794
to get it out?

376
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:54,056
- Yeah. Pull.

377
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,231
- Lincoln,

378
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:56,450
this is totally
against protocol.

379
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:57,973
A medical examiner
should be doing this.

380
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,279
- I agree with her
wholeheartedly.

381
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:01,150
- We can't wait on the M.E.

382
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:03,022
The gastric acid is eating
away at the clues.

383
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:05,154
If we lose those clues,
a third victim dies.

384
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:07,200
- So much for "relax and
forget about the stakes."

385
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:08,984
- Hurry. But do it carefully.

386
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,594
- You can't tell me to hurry

387
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:12,118
and do it carefully
at the same time, Lincoln.

388
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,342
- Good. Nice and easy.

389
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:20,865
- Ugh.

390
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:22,389
I see something.

391
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:26,045
Ugh.
It's stuck.

392
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,437
- What do you mean?
- It's jammed.

393
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,091
Wedged.
Not moving.

394
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,484
- Cut it.

395
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:32,007
- What? The string?
- His throat.

396
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,487
-  Are you insane?

397
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,097
- A tracheotomy on a dead body

398
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:37,056
is a hell of a lot better than
letting the next victim die.

399
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,145
- Lincoln,
this is borderline il

400
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:40,755
- We don't have a choice!

401
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:43,714
Amelia, your job is to do what
I would do if I were there,

402
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:45,325
and if I were there, I would
have been holding those clues

403
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:47,109
five minutes ago.

404
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:48,371
Now, take the knife and

405
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:57,641
- Atta girl.

406
00:17:57,685 --> 00:18:00,166
- We have the clues.

407
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,993
That's all that matters.

408
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:07,347
- Easy.

409
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:12,613
- What'd you say
about feeling dizzy?

410
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,876
- Nice work.

411
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,834
Yeah.
Take a minute.

412
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:19,620
Eric's still talking
to the surrounding businesses.

413
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,628
- Any witnesses?

414
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:30,021
- Like a ghost,
as usual.

415
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:33,721
All right. I'll go get you some
water, and we'll take off.

416
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:35,505
- This morning, there was
a carbon dioxide leak

417
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,290
in this establishment's
kitchen,

418
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,466
causing one fatality.

419
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:40,554
The police were called to the
corner of

420
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:42,425
- So we're lying
to the public now?

421
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,819
- After an employee...
- Omitting details.

422
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:47,648
The mayor wants a lid on
anything Bone Collector.

423
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,955
And you guys don't think
that might set him off?

424
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:53,088
- Identified as 25-year-old...

425
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,742
- We're depriving him
of credit.

426
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,178
- Right.

427
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,659
Wouldn't want him to do
anything crazy, would we?

428
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,232
- I can always tell when
you're lying, you know.

429
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:08,059
You're upset about something.

430
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:09,278
Honey?

431
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:11,846
- Sorry.

432
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:14,196
I was...distracted
by the news.

433
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,025
Horrible accident.
- No. That's not it.

434
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:19,941
You're carrying
so much tension.

435
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:21,986
You're not yourself.

436
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:28,079
Work is not going as I hoped.

437
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:29,298
- There.
See?

438
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:30,604
Now, was that so hard?

439
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:33,172
- It's just
- You're a perfectionist.

440
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:36,436
You worry about what other
people think about your work,

441
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:40,396
but the truth is,
recognition comes in time.

442
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,790
If you value what you do,

443
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,227
that's all the validation
you need.

444
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:50,276
- You're a gift, Danielle.

445
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,495
What have I done
to deserve you?

446
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:54,541
- Aww.

447
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:57,196
- Lincoln, you mention
the tavern in your book.

448
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,632
- I know.
I wrote it.

449
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:00,416
- Here: "I had once chased
a perp through a restaurant

450
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,592
"and lost him, only to
realize I'd failed to check

451
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,203
"the ladies' room
he was hiding in.

452
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,509
"This time, in Fraunces Tavern,

453
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:08,163
I didn't make the same
mistake."

454
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,991
"I knocked first
politely."

455
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:11,384
- "Then made my arrest."

456
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,128
Much as I love a recitation
of my words,

457
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:18,608
I gather you're working
a theory.

458
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,262
- I have been researching

459
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:22,046
the previous crime scenes
to this case,

460
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,485
and I read FBI agent Cutter's
profile on the Bone Collector

461
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:27,617
- I value your ambitions
as a profiler.

462
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,836
I do.

463
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:29,924
But Agent Cutter was never

464
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,273
in the same room
as the Bone Collector.

465
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:33,493
She speculates based
on statistics, and

466
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:34,972
- Let her finish, Lincoln.

467
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,281
- As Agent Cutter says,

468
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,675
"View each crime scene
as a conversation."

469
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:45,853
So what is the Bone Collector
trying to tell us

470
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:47,463
about each new murder?

471
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:50,074
- He's telling us he's
superior to me.

472
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:51,337
I've been in his crosshairs

473
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,687
ever since I found
his first hidden puzzle.

474
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,646
A worthy adversary he feels
compelled to prove unworthy.

475
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,518
He's read my book
and wants to tarnish

476
00:20:58,561 --> 00:20:59,562
my greatest achievements

477
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:01,521
by dropping innocent bodies
on them.

478
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:03,131
People I can't save.

479
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:05,307
People I knew.

480
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:06,613
Or do you see it differently?

481
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:08,310
- I do.

482
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:11,270
II mean,
just look at the tavern.

483
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,749
You didn't really know
that person,

484
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:15,839
and was it really one
of your greatest achievements?

485
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:17,232
- Everyone's a critic.

486
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,973
- That's not what I meant.

487
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:21,541
It's just, it's a random case

488
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:23,717
in a book full of huge,
incredible anecdotes.

489
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,893
Why that one?
I mean, you said it yourself.

490
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:29,853
Everything means something
to the Bone Collector.

491
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:31,986
Lincoln, I agree,

492
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:34,336
he is targeting
your career triumphs.

493
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,338
But just like
Agent Cutter said,

494
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:38,601
this is about ego.

495
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,081
- I've read every word
Agent Cutter wrote

496
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:41,561
about the Bone Collector.

497
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:43,302
I didn't hire you to
regurgitate research.

498
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,347
I hired you to be
my eyes and ears.

499
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:47,218
My brain works just fine.

500
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,787
Yeah, well, so does mine.

501
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:54,443
- I know.

502
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,402
So use it to come up
with something actionable

503
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:58,534
to help us catch
the Bone Collector today!

504
00:21:58,578 --> 00:22:00,406
Or else we're just
wasting time.

505
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:02,843
And every minute we lose
today is

506
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:04,540
Is

507
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:05,672
- Lincoln?

508
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:06,629
- Claire!
- Hey, hey.

509
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:08,283
- Claire? ClClaire!

510
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,371
We need you in here!

511
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:11,895
- He was talking one minute.
All of a sudden, he

512
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:13,462
- Give him some space,
please.

513
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:15,116
- What's happening?

514
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:16,596
- Call 911 now.

515
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:18,554
God, your heartbeat is
out of control.

516
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:19,947
Stay with me, Lincoln.

517
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,775
- Stay with me, Lincoln.

518
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,429
- Stay with me, Lincoln.

519
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,042
- Stay with me.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

520
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,001
.

521
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:32,263
- Of all days.

522
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:34,483
- I know.
I feel terrible.

523
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:37,399
I mean, we were arguing,
and then the next minute

524
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:38,835
- It's not your fault.

525
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,489
Just sometimes,
when he gets upset

526
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:43,623
it's autonomic dysreflexia.

527
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:46,190
It's when a paralyzed person's
brain receives alerts

528
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:48,279
from the body
that something is wrong,

529
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:51,108
but there's no way to pinpoint
the source of the problem.

530
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:53,937
Everything goes haywire.

531
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:56,113
To a quadriplegic,
an ingrown toenail

532
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:58,159
has the same urgency
as a heart attack.

533
00:22:58,202 --> 00:22:59,639
- This has happened before?

534
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:01,380
- Sadly, yes.

535
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,904
Look, they'll find the source,
and he'll be fine.

536
00:23:03,947 --> 00:23:05,732
It's just a little mystery.

537
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:09,605
High stakes.
Only a few clues to work with.

538
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:13,653
You have enough of that today
without worrying about this.

539
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:15,002
- That's the thing.

540
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:19,659
There's still a third victim
out there,

541
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:22,357
and I don't know how to find
them without Lincoln.

542
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:30,147
- Five minutes to air.
- Mr. Deerfield?

543
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,497
- Give me a minute, Leah.
- Hunter?

544
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,498
- What?

545
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:37,024
- You really need to
look at this.

546
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:55,129
- Guess we'll be changing
our lead story.

547
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,479
- I said I'm fine.

548
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:58,741
It's over.

549
00:23:58,785 --> 00:24:01,744
- I'm just doing
my job, Lincoln.

550
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:03,050
- Hey.

551
00:24:03,093 --> 00:24:05,835
- Where are we on victim
number three?

552
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:07,707
- Uh, Lincoln

553
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,709
- I'm fine.
Truly.

554
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:12,059
I I appreciate your concern.

555
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:14,409
Now, can we try
and save someone?

556
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,717
- Claire said you
could have died.

557
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,979
II mean the rest of us
can

558
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:20,023
- I get it.

559
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:22,112
Yes, I could have died.

560
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:23,505
That's what this man did to me.

561
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,594
He made it so that a damn
bugbite can take my life,

562
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:27,944
can prevent me from saving
someone else's life.

563
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:30,251
Let me do everything
I can to stop him.

564
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:33,863
Can we get back to work?

565
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:38,346
Okay.

566
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:39,695
Kate should be
here any minute, and

567
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:40,783
- Glad to see you're up,

568
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:44,265
but you're not gonna like this.

569
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:46,615
- Breaking right now:
the Bone Collector.

570
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:48,225
The serial killer
who plagued New York

571
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:50,663
for half a decade is back.

572
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:52,534
NYPD will not comment,
but we can confirm

573
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:55,058
that two victims have
been found dead today

574
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:57,017
here in New York City.

575
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,366
And if history is
any predictor,

576
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:00,368
that means there's
one more to come.

577
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:02,979
- Someone leaked this.
- Worse.

578
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:04,807
The Bone Collector sent
him Polaroids

579
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:07,984
of the first two victims.
Labs ran the envelope.

580
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:09,203
They got nothing.
- He's taunting us.

581
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:11,422
- He's gonna
panic the city.

582
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:13,816
- I heard.

583
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,602
I want to check
those envelopes myself, though.

584
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:18,038
In the meantime,

585
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,953
the colorful powder from
the second victim's stomach

586
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:21,868
is patina,
or corroded copper

587
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:24,000
that's been exposed
to sulfur and oxide compounds.

588
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:25,611
- Also known as verdigris.

589
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:27,743
Formed when bronze, brass,
or copper is weathered

590
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:30,441
or exposed
to seawater over time.

591
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:31,747
What else?

592
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:33,575
- Item two is a plant stem.
Quercus rubra.

593
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:35,664
Commonly known as
northern red oak.

594
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:36,970
- Where from, exactly?

595
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:38,841
- Hacked every field study,
environmental blog,

596
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:41,017
and your own notes
from General 14C;

597
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:43,759
cross-referenced it with
the Bone Collector sample.

598
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:46,109
Shows hints of Hudson grime.

599
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:47,154
Somewhere on the river.

600
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:48,285
- What about the knife?

601
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:49,678
- It's an oyster-shucking
knife,

602
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:50,723
which is relatively rare,

603
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:51,941
but can be purchased
at any store

604
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:53,160
that sells kitchenware.

605
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:55,205
Wiped of all prints.
No barcode.

606
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:58,208
- Copper patina, oak leaf,
and an oyster knife.

607
00:25:58,252 --> 00:26:01,647
- And this is gonna be
specific to you and your book.

608
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:08,523
- Felix, bring up a map
of New York and the Hudson.

609
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,481
Early 1800s.

610
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:16,270
Zoom in on Communipaw.

611
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:19,447
It's the Lenape name
for "other side of the river,"

612
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,145
or, as we know it, New Jersey.

613
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:23,930
The land that borders
the Hudson

614
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:26,193
was flush with oyster beds
until 1839,

615
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:28,717
when the central railroad
of New Jersey was built

616
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:29,979
and destroyed them.

617
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:32,329
Across the river,
60 years later,

618
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:34,070
Ellis Island processed
immigrants

619
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:35,898
greeted
by Lady Liberty herself,

620
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:37,639
dazzled in patina copper.

621
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:40,120
Nearly 2/3 of them
passed through

622
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:41,991
to the New Jersey
railroad terminal

623
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:43,906
now known
as Liberty State Park,

624
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,606
which hosts more than 750
trees, red oak among them,

625
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,869
as a living memorial
for the residents

626
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:53,394
of New Jersey who died
in the attacks on 9/11.

627
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:58,573
And you want the book
to mean something?

628
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,749
- Stop! NYPD!

629
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:19,550
- Stop moving.

630
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:22,118
- Hands behind your back.

631
00:27:22,162 --> 00:27:25,208
- Like I said,
follow the evidence.

632
00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:27,123
Liberty State Park
is the location

633
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,690
that launched my career,

634
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:30,431
where I told your idol
Agent Cutter how

635
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:31,693
to catch the Tourist Killer.

636
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:34,870
- Okay. Liberty State Park.
Let's move.

637
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:36,002
- Wait.

638
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:37,177
- We don't have
time to wait.

639
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,613
The clues are there.
It's in the book.

640
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,137
- I know that Liberty State
Park made you famous,

641
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:43,879
and I know the ending
to your book,

642
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:44,924
but it feels predictable.

643
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,839
Like, it just

644
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:48,231
Lincoln, it feels too easy.

645
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:49,885
- You think this was easy?
- Look, I don't know.

646
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:51,104
It just feels wrong.

647
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:52,409
I don't think he'd choose it.

648
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:54,411
- So based on your read
of his personality,

649
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:57,327
where should we go, Amelia,
before someone else dies?

650
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:06,423
- I don't know.
- So we follow the evidence,

651
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:08,599
because here's
what I do know.

652
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:11,472
Evidence informs the profile,
not the other way around.

653
00:28:14,344 --> 00:28:16,216
- Can we have a minute?
- We don't have a minute.

654
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,740
- That's what you said
to me three years ago.

655
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:21,047
Ten minutes before
you entered that warehouse,

656
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,744
you and I
had this very exchange.

657
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:23,745
- No.
- We did.

658
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:25,094
I said,
"Don't rush in there."

659
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:26,705
- I was right.
The victim was there.

660
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,271
- I was right!

661
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:29,751
I said he was setting us up.

662
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:31,927
I said we need to think
before we walk into a trap.

663
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,450
- You think I should have
let that victim die!

664
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:35,931
- I'm saying I had a feeling
something was wrong,

665
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:38,673
but you knew you were right!

666
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,674
And here we are.

667
00:28:41,676 --> 00:28:47,116
So if Amelia's gut is saying
something's wrong...

668
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,727
let's take a minute, okay?

669
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,686
Let's take a minute.
Get it right.

670
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:01,304
- What?
- Um...

671
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:03,654
- Okay.
The three clues.

672
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:07,049
We know they lead
to Liberty State Park.

673
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:10,313
Could they mean anything else?

674
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:11,967
- Copper patina.

675
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:13,273
Oak leaf.

676
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:14,927
Oyster knife.

677
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,363
- And the book.

678
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:22,412
- The roof over
Grand Central Terminal.

679
00:29:22,456 --> 00:29:23,674
Recently restored,

680
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:26,503
because the copper patina
was causing leaks.

681
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:30,681
Under that roof, the oldest
oyster bar in the city.

682
00:29:30,725 --> 00:29:33,641
The entire terminal accented
with oak leaf carvings.

683
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:36,252
A symbol of
the Vanderbilt family

684
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:39,081
who financed the construction
in 1871.

685
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:42,345
- Lincoln, you tracked
Hans Baker there.

686
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:44,391
The murderer you arrested
on the platform.

687
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:46,393
- The same three clues lead
to two different places.

688
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:48,047
- Which one is it?

689
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,876
- Uh...II don't know.

690
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,878
II mean, not for sure.

691
00:29:52,921 --> 00:29:54,967
- Go to Grand Central.

692
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,533
You and Eric go to
Liberty State Park.

693
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:58,535
- You won't have eyes.
- Talk me through it.

694
00:29:58,579 --> 00:29:59,928
Go.

695
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:01,190
- Thank you.

696
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:07,849
.

697
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:15,901
- Talk to me.

698
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:17,641
- No chaos.
No one seems to be

699
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:18,686
- Dead?

700
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:20,166
Good.
We're in time.

701
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,428
- All right.

702
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:22,690
Let's get all the tourists out
of the way.

703
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:24,170
Let's not cause a panic.

704
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:26,302
We'll corral them by the ferry,
and don't let 'em leave.

705
00:30:26,346 --> 00:30:27,826
- All right.
Let's divide and conquer.

706
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,001
I'm gonna check the north side

707
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:30,306
like when he first
saw the Tourist Killer.

708
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,655
- All right. Good.
I'll head into the terminal

709
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:32,918
where he caught him.

710
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,314
- Amelia, you there?

711
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:41,883
- Please evacuate
the terminal.

712
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:43,145
- I'm here.

713
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:46,366
- Please walk carefully
to the ledges.

714
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:49,673
Follow the directions
of law enforcement officers.

715
00:30:49,717 --> 00:30:52,807
- No, I see nothing,
except a commuter's nightmare.

716
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,114
Where do I go?
- Go straight.

717
00:30:55,157 --> 00:30:58,160
Head for the platform.
That's where I got Hans Baker.

718
00:30:58,204 --> 00:31:01,816
- Please evacuate
the terminal.

719
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,252
- Sellitto, what
are we looking at?

720
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:05,037
- Nothing yet.

721
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:09,911
It's just deserted.

722
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:14,916
It's not here.

723
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,570
- The clues lead here.
Keep looking.

724
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:18,398
There should be a passageway.
South side of the terminal.

725
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:20,574
That's the only place
you haven't checked.

726
00:31:20,617 --> 00:31:22,228
- I got it.

727
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:50,299
- Amelia, that's
where I got him.

728
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:52,519
- I know. I don't see anything.

729
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:06,533
- Sellitto, what do you see?

730
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:07,621
- It's your book.

731
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:09,014
- I knew it.

732
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:11,190
- No. I mean it's your book,
but there's no body.

733
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:13,061
It's got to be a misdirect.

734
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:14,715
It's got to be Grand Central.

735
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:15,672
- Amelia, it's got to be here.

736
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:17,631
- But it isn't.

737
00:32:17,674 --> 00:32:20,373
Unless the Bone Collector's
about to arrive on a train.

738
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:21,809
- Keep looking.

739
00:32:21,852 --> 00:32:23,811
I've been too late, but
I've never failed at this.

740
00:32:23,854 --> 00:32:25,508
We can't be wrong.

741
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:30,122
- Lincoln,
it's the wrong platform.

742
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:31,297
- No.
This is where I caught him.

743
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,081
- Yes, but it's not
the only time

744
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,778
you mentioned Grand Central
in your book.

745
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:36,128
- The suicide?

746
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:37,520
- The guy who jumped in front
of the train.

747
00:32:37,564 --> 00:32:39,566
Do you remember what else
you wrote about it?

748
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:42,569
- What I failed to notice
was the guy on the edge.

749
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:43,744
Too close to the edge,

750
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:45,528
and as the train came in,
he...

751
00:32:45,572 --> 00:32:47,052
jumped.

752
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:48,444
But that wasn't a case.
That was a story about

753
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:50,490
- Where you failed.
Your words.

754
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,144
You failed.

755
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:55,147
This was never about him
tarnishing your success.

756
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,671
He's reminding you
of your failures.

757
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:01,501
- Professor Banks.

758
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:03,329
He failed me
in his history class.

759
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:05,853
- Before you made the arrest
at Fraunces Tavern,

760
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,159
you failed to check
the ladies' room.

761
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:10,075
- And then the suicide.
I failed to save him.

762
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:11,990
Amelia, it's Track 19.

763
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,382
Go. Now.

764
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:21,260
- I'm here.
It looks abandoned.

765
00:33:21,303 --> 00:33:23,392
- Very end of the platform.
That's where he jumped.

766
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,623
Damn. We're too late.

767
00:33:39,843 --> 00:33:41,584
- Sorry, Lincoln.

768
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:47,199
We tried everything.

769
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:53,509
- She's alive!

770
00:33:57,774 --> 00:34:00,081
- Amelia, no!

771
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,431
- It's okay.
- It could be a trap.

772
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,129
- I don't see anything.
- She's still alive.

773
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:06,566
That means he could
be here watching.

774
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,355
- You'd do it.

775
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:15,096
Lincoln, you would do it
if you were here.

776
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,272
- I know, and look
at where it got me.

777
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,629
- Screw it.

778
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:30,851
I got you, okay?

779
00:34:30,894 --> 00:34:33,114
I got you. Okay.

780
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:36,987
I'm gonna push you back, okay?

781
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:40,643
I got you. I got you. Shh.

782
00:34:42,689 --> 00:34:44,517
- Okay.

783
00:34:46,823 --> 00:34:48,912
Okay. Okay.

784
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:50,871
Breathe. Breathe.

785
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:52,742
Okay.
It's okay.

786
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:54,788
- It's okay. I know. I know.

787
00:34:58,183 --> 00:34:59,619
- You did it, Amelia.

788
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:06,626
You saved her.

789
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:09,498
- We did it.

790
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:10,891
- The paramedics
are on their way.

791
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:12,066
- All of us.

792
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:16,679
.

793
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:18,507
- I've examined
every microscopic speck

794
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:19,943
of the photos.

795
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:21,380
Wiped clean of
any usable evidence.

796
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:23,382
- How about the woman?

797
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:25,035
- Anaña Ceru.

798
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,820
She's gonna make it,
but she can barely talk.

799
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:28,300
She doesn't remember anything.

800
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:30,650
She got off the train,
felt something around her neck,

801
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:32,260
passed out cold.

802
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:34,436
- And as far as we can tell,

803
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,482
no one saw him.

804
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:38,440
No one saw anything.

805
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:39,876
The track was closed
for repair.

806
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,576
Security cameras went dark.

807
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,056
- But it was a win, Lincoln.

808
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,276
I mean, for the first time,
we saved someone.

809
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,236
- It's not a win.
Two more people died today.

810
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:56,502
We're not closer to finding
him, and he played me again.

811
00:35:56,545 --> 00:35:57,981
I was wrong,

812
00:35:58,025 --> 00:35:59,418
and if you hadn't seen
through it

813
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:01,724
- But I did.

814
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:03,900
And then Sellitto convinced
you to listen,

815
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:06,816
and then you figured it out.

816
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,644
And now, he's gonna be
shaken up

817
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:10,559
because his game
didn't work.

818
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:13,258
We beat him.
- That's what worries me.

819
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:15,521
When he wins the game,
he goes dark for a year.

820
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:17,784
What happens when he loses?

821
00:36:17,827 --> 00:36:19,525
Does he have to play again?

822
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:20,613
Tomorrow?

823
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:22,397
- We can't let him play again.

824
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:24,312
- Yeah, but how do we stop him?

825
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,538
- Nice work,
Officer Rhyme.

826
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:34,061
- Thank you.

827
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:39,588
Something else?

828
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:40,676
- Yes.

829
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,679
You're smart and you're good,

830
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:45,986
but you're arrogant, Lincoln.

831
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:48,249
But may I remind you,
I had a team

832
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:51,339
and we spent a long time
tracking this guy.

833
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:53,950
You brought us the final piece,
and for that, I commend you,

834
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:56,214
but this wasn't you alone.

835
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:57,432
It was a team effort,

836
00:36:57,476 --> 00:36:59,521
and if you can't play
on the team,

837
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:01,349
you'll be good,

838
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:03,873
but you'll only be so good.

839
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:10,053
- You said the game is
he throws and I swing,

840
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:11,272
but he's not playing me
anymore.

841
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:13,187
He's playing us.

842
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,015
And you're right.
We had a victory today.

843
00:37:15,058 --> 00:37:18,236
Not a win, but a small victory.

844
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,325
What did we learn?

845
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:21,891
What helps us change the rules?

846
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:25,417
- Today was all about
your failures,

847
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,940
and he was throwing
them in your face.

848
00:37:26,983 --> 00:37:30,683
So what that says to
me is

849
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:33,251
he's got his own
failures that haunt him.

850
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:34,556
- Like what?

851
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,949
- Well, he hasn't failed
as the Bone Collector,

852
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:39,822
but nobody starts killing
three people in a day.

853
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:41,389
That's an escalation.

854
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:42,912
So where did he start

855
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:44,827
before he learned to get away
with everything?

856
00:37:44,871 --> 00:37:47,743
Before he learned not
to make mistakes?

857
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:49,354
- Well, don't you think I've
done that?

858
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:51,094
We went through everything.

859
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:52,922
Piled through unsolved cases
for years.

860
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:56,056
- Yeah, but now
you have a whole team here.

861
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:59,581
We change the parameters,
look in different places,

862
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,018
look at other crimes.

863
00:38:02,062 --> 00:38:04,673
We profile everything
that we know now

864
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:06,414
and we keep looking
until we find him.

865
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:08,634
- So we find his first kill
or his second,

866
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:09,765
where he made a mistake.

867
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,114
- It's a good plan,

868
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:12,551
but it doesn't change
the game for him.

869
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:13,769
He's gonna keep killing.

870
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:15,336
- And the city's
already in a panic.

871
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,252
- Well, let's see if we can
stir up a little panic

872
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,297
in the Bone Collector.

873
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,212
Play offense.

874
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,740
- I'm Hunter Deerfield live
with NYPD detective

875
00:38:27,783 --> 00:38:30,220
Lincoln Rhyme to talk
about our breaking story:

876
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:32,614
the return
of the Bone Collector.

877
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:36,139
So three years ago, your hunt
for the infamous serial killer

878
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:39,882
left you paralyzed
and retired from the force.

879
00:38:39,926 --> 00:38:43,146
Today, two more New Yorkers
have been murdered,

880
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,234
but not a third.

881
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:45,410
- That's right.

882
00:38:45,453 --> 00:38:47,063
Anaña Ceru is alive.

883
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:49,022
Tonight, we beat the
Bone Collector at his game.

884
00:38:49,065 --> 00:38:50,458
- Now, let me ask you this.

885
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:53,026
For three years, he went dark.
Why is he back now?

886
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:55,158
- I believe he's back
for one reason:

887
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:57,944
to taunt me,
because I'm back.

888
00:38:57,987 --> 00:38:59,249
But as of tonight,
he can't do that anymore.

889
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:00,425
I quit.

890
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:02,644
- You're quitting the case?
- No.

891
00:39:02,688 --> 00:39:04,472
I'm quitting the game.

892
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:06,256
Because he cheats.

893
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,867
His game is rigged.

894
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,216
It's an elaborate distraction,

895
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:11,914
so instead,
I've decided

896
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:13,829
we've decided.

897
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:15,048
My team and I,

898
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:16,484
we're going
to play a new game.

899
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:18,834
so let me address
the Bone Collector directly,

900
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:20,183
if he's watching.

901
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:23,796
For eight years,
we let you set the rules,

902
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,711
but now we're done.

903
00:39:25,754 --> 00:39:28,366
We have a new game
with new rules.

904
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:32,065
And all you need to know
is we're coming for you

905
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:33,283
and we will find you.

906
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:35,285
- Thank you,
Detective Rhyme.

907
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:37,723
And there you have it.
A new game with new rules.

908
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:40,856
The Bone
Collector better watch out.

909
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,728
- How long have you known?

910
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:52,781
- We've been after
him for a few weeks.

911
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:56,219
Rach, he knows
where we live.

912
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:59,397
He sent a human bone
to the apartment,

913
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,050
and I didn't tell you

914
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:03,226
because I wanted
to protect you.

915
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,881
Especially after everything
that you've been through.

916
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:08,318
But you deserve
to know what's happening,

917
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:13,062
even if it scares me
as much as it scares you

918
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:16,109
and even if I can't promise
it'll be okay.

919
00:40:16,152 --> 00:40:18,677
- Mmaybe you were
right to lie to me.

920
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,419
- Oh, come here.

921
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:24,596
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

922
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,120
- What Lincoln said...

923
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:31,559
aabout the new game
and the new rules...

924
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:37,130
Is that really gonna work?

925
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,449
- Hey, Dad. You're up late.

926
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:53,799
Don't old people have to go
to bed early?

927
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:55,975
- Funny man.

928
00:40:56,018 --> 00:40:57,498
How was basketball?

929
00:40:57,542 --> 00:41:00,588
- It was good.

930
00:41:00,632 --> 00:41:02,198
Sorry I didn't tell you.

931
00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:04,244
- It's fine.

932
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:06,507
You like it?
- I do.

933
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:10,163
-  Glad to hear.

934
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:13,775
- So...something you wanted?

935
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:18,519
- Just to...talk to you,

936
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:20,086
make sure you're good.

937
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:22,044
- Well, I'm good. You?

938
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:27,528
- Yeah.

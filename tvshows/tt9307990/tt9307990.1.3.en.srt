so scared of?

a witness,

Eric got a hit on the Cadillac.

Belongs to a guy
named Nick Popov.

333
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:42,256
He lives a block away
from here,

334
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:45,825
but the car is registered
to his sister in New Jersey,

335
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,696
which is why it took
so long to find.

- Officers said it's not
at his place.

- Witnesses lie all the time,
but the evidence never does.

340
00:13:57,749 --> 00:13:59,664
That car is another
potential crime scene

341

for us to examine.

342
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:03,712
It could take us right to Lucy.

343
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:05,627

344
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,368
Unfortunately, it was stolen.

345

Oh, that's too bad.

346

- Last night, from right out
of my driveway.

347
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:15,985
I had a date with a nice lady
from around the corner.

348

As we were walking home
from dinner,

349
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:21,034
we passed by my place,
and I saw the car was gone.

I was gonna make the report
today.

that you had dinner with,

does she have a name?

353

I, uh, dropped her off

355
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,307
just before 11:00.

356
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,787
She was gonna stay outside
for a smoke.

357
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,530
- And then what happened?

358
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:43,099
- When I was walking away,
I heard Natalya scream.

359

She said she'd seen a rat.

360

It was very loud.
Natalya, I said--

- Yeah, let me guess.

362

You said, "You're gonna wake up
the whole neighborhood!"

Why?

367

Because she's missing, Nick.

368
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:11,954
She was grabbed off the street
five years ago.

Maybe she's dead,
maybe she's alive,

She went missing
almost ten years ago.

Injuries to her neck were
consistent with strangulation.

When Jamie was kidnapped,
she was 16 years old.

- He held her captive
for five years.

to teenage girls.

Lucy was Jamie's replacement.

Max built a tomb

The girl with the black eye?

What if Max tried
to abduct her,

717
00:30:56,506 --> 00:30:57,812
but she fought him off?

718
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,901
- She tells her parents,
they round up a posse

But they didn't know
about Lucy.

They might have information.

They don't even know
it's important.

- Good luck getting them
to talk.

They're too afraid
of being arrested.

was at stake.

here today.

we'll deal with that later.

to help.

you spoke English.

740
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,688

I'm sorry.

to hurt anyone.

And...you were the woman
who screamed

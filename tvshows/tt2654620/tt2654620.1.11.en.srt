1
00:00:00,196 --> 00:00:01,556
Previously on The Strain...

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,197
Ah, mi hijo.

3
00:00:03,227 --> 00:00:05,497
So good to have two kids together again.

4
00:00:05,527 --> 00:00:08,450
How many times I have to tell?
No recycling in the hallway.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,581
Now we're talking about the way
you speak to my mother.

6
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:13,786
If she ever tells me you
talk to her like that again,

7
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:15,452
you're gonna find your body

8
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,554
in one of those recycling bins
you love so much.

9
00:00:17,622 --> 00:00:20,557
What was in that coffin? Soil...

10
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:22,708
Where's that cabinet?

11
00:00:22,738 --> 00:00:25,170
That box was 500 pounds;
nothing could lift it up like that.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,102
If you have the coffin,
then you still have him!

13
00:00:27,132 --> 00:00:29,152
Do not allow it across the river!

14
00:00:29,182 --> 00:00:32,472
Something evil has taken root.
Rats don't migrate like that.

15
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,426
Something's driving them
off from underground.

16
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:36,757
It's hiding down there in the dark.

17
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:39,330
I tracked the epicenter
of the rat-free zone.

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,628
We have to look at all
the decommissioned tunnels

19
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:46,043
- near the World Trade Center.
- Kill the Master and his spawn will die.

20
00:00:47,084 --> 00:00:49,085
They're coming.

21
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:52,204
Uh... alright.

22
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,471
UV light bomb test.

23
00:00:57,274 --> 00:01:00,582
Hey! No, no, no. Come on! Come on!

24
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:07,921
- Now I can't see anything.
- That's right.

25
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:09,433
It's better than burning out
your retinas looking

26
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:11,804
- at the UVC rays.
- No fair.

27
00:01:11,983 --> 00:01:14,361
This is a... good idea?

28
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:16,613
Uh...

29
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:19,184
Well, we're about to find out.

30
00:01:19,562 --> 00:01:21,981
Fire in the hole!

31
00:01:27,998 --> 00:01:30,443
You might want to put that out.

32
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:38,768
- What happened?
- In engineering terms, uh...

33
00:01:39,076 --> 00:01:40,699
You'd call that a fail.

34
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:42,824
An epic fail.

35
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:44,755
Well, light was strong while it lasted.

36
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,979
- Was it long enough to hurt them?
- Could be bigger.

37
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,870
Need to keep the bulbs bright
enough to do the job without

38
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,537
- burning them out so fast.
- Well if it were me, I would

39
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,320
make the lights cycle on and off,

40
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,751
strobe like a camera flash.
That might stop

41
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:59,925
the bulbs from burning out.

42
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:00,729
Huh.

43
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,671
I could rig up a fog machine too,
you know, crank some tunes,

44
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:05,876
really get 'em dancing.
Just boom, boom, boom.

45
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:09,538
- Forget I mentioned it. Do what you want.
- I'm just joking, Doc.

46
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:11,280
Hmm?

47
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:16,291
I'm not saying I disagree
because I do agree with you.

48
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:18,599
Don't fall off your high horse.

49
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,343
Problem is, is that...

50
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:24,972
Well, we can't do any more tests.

51
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:27,809
I could put the rest of our bulbs in...

52
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:31,168
Tinker with the circuit board,
put in an oscillator...

53
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:34,805
But we're gonna have to go
with what we end up with.

54
00:02:34,873 --> 00:02:36,143
Hope for the best.

55
00:02:36,173 --> 00:02:39,352
Mr. Fet, you've just described
my method of operation

56
00:02:39,382 --> 00:02:42,224
for the past six decades.

59
00:03:01,771 --> 00:03:03,869
Mama, what are you doing?!

60
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,601
I can't find anything
in this damn kitchen!

61
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:11,037
Apparently she's searching

62
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,533
for an ashtray she once owned

63
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:15,513
from the Alvear Hotel, Buenos Aires.

64
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:18,912
I know it's here somewhere.

65
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:20,695
Mama...

66
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:25,324
That broke years ago. Hm?

67
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:29,534
I'll clean it up.

68
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,824
This is not your kitchen.

69
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:43,603
An ashtray here.

70
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,060
Thank you.

71
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:47,564
Ah.

72
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:56,352
- I don't like him.
- Mr. Setrakian is our host.

73
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:58,555
He has a dark soul.

74
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:00,069
Mama, basta.

75
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:01,952
_

76
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:05,146
_

77
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:09,679
Toma.

78
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,287
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:19,593
I understand what she's experiencing.

80
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:22,557
She's wrong, what she said about you.

81
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:25,061
No, she's not.

82
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,532
Is your mother going to be OK?

83
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:32,669
She gets coused sometimes.

84
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,549
She mistakes memories for reality.

85
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:38,908
She must have really liked that ashtray.

86
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:42,516
It was from a hotel-restaurant

87
00:04:42,546 --> 00:04:45,282
where my father took her
on their first date.

88
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:48,584
He wanted a memento,
because he knew right then,

89
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:51,621
from that first night,
that he was gonna marry her.

90
00:04:51,651 --> 00:04:55,206
Well then, maybe it's good
that she still remembers it.

91
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:57,855
I think you're right.

92
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,821
Crispin, open the door.

93
00:05:12,704 --> 00:05:15,640
Crispin, open the damn door!
I'm not playing, bro!

94
00:05:26,798 --> 00:05:28,029
Mama?

95
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,724
Where's Mom?

96
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:58,215
Crispin, do you hear me?
Where is mom?

97
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:53,969
No!

98
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:58,792
No! No!

99
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:05,100
First, do no harm.

100
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:07,380
Things have changed.

101
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:09,792
Have they?

102
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:12,987
Take a remote village, say 200 years ago.

103
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:16,235
Residents are manifesting
strange symptoms.

104
00:07:16,265 --> 00:07:18,937
Dying, fear and superstition
rule the day,

105
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:22,595
and a curse is blamed until
someone like you or me shows up

106
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:25,385
and, through a scientific
process of elimination,

107
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:29,323
traces the disease to a
source and destroys it.

108
00:07:29,832 --> 00:07:32,859
The curse is lifted. People are saved.

109
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,561
Order is restored.

110
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:36,899
So you believe now?

111
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,188
If we slay the Master,
this plague of vampirism

112
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:42,540
- ends today?
- I have to believe it.

113
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,528
Otherwise, I can't justify
leaving Zack here...

114
00:07:47,204 --> 00:07:48,589
at the risk of...

115
00:07:49,044 --> 00:07:51,738
being orphaned or...

116
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:53,996
worse.

117
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:58,251
- We'll make it back here.
- What if we don't?

118
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:05,751
Maybe one of us should stay.

119
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,127
You mean me?

120
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:13,717
- I-I would never ask you that...
- You just did.

121
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,139
- The answer is no.
- I didn't mean it like that.

122
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:22,057
- I'm leaving my mother behind.
- I know, I know you are.

123
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:25,100
You and I are not assassins.

124
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:28,618
Fet, that kill-happy exterminator,

125
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:30,567
this kamikaze mission is his wet dream.

126
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:33,398
And the old man is consumed
by an ancient grudge.

127
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:37,056
No plan B, because they have
no one but themselves at risk.

128
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:38,976
I don't think we have any other choice.

129
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:12,993
This was the, uh...

130
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:15,333
Weapon Jim Kent chose to use.

131
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:17,938
You would honor him by taking it.

132
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:21,235
Thank you.

133
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,050
- When will you be back?
- Sundown, absolute latest.

134
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,047
- That's the whole day!
- Hopefully sooner.

135
00:09:33,252 --> 00:09:35,685
- What about Mom?
- I think the best thing is

136
00:09:35,715 --> 00:09:38,931
to, uh... take out that...

137
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:42,089
The thing that's causing all this.
Mr. Setrakian has a plan.

138
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:44,658
I understand, but why
can't I come with you?

139
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:48,142
I don't know what's out there. I...

140
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:51,331
I can't control that
environment, but here...

141
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,801
You've seen Mr. Setrakian's
basement, it's a fortress,

142
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:55,869
it's an armory. It's the most safe place

143
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,376
- I could imagine for you.
- You'll be careful, right?

144
00:09:58,601 --> 00:09:59,935
Of course.

145
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,710
I promise. In the meantime,
keep an eye on Mrs. Martinez.

146
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,712
Shouldn't that be the other way around?

147
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,072
Should be.

148
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:10,617
But you're in charge.
You stay in the basement.

149
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,054
Both of you. Don't let anybody see you.

150
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,556
OK.

151
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:19,061
Time to go.

152
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:22,163
You're brave.

153
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,310
I love you.

154
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:57,088
I love you too.

She went out with all the others.

I need my cigarettes.

Let's haul ass! Come on!

- Everybody's having fun now.
- Every man for himself.

185
00:13:03,178 --> 00:13:05,695
That's what the Master is counting on.

186
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:14,378
Don't stop! Run! Run! Run! Run!

187
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:23,752
C'mon, Mama, pick up.

188
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:27,478
Pick up, Mama, please.

189
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,325
_

190
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:48,503
Thank you for calling

191
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:51,191
Harlem's Hospital Center.
If you know your party's extension...

192
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,331
- Nurse's desk, 4B.
- Yeah, can I speak to

193
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,468
Guadalupe Elizalde, please?
It's an emergency.

194
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:03,112
- May I ask who's calling?
- It's Augustine Elizalde, her son.

195
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,937
- Yeah, hold on.
- OK.

196
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:09,674
Mr. Elizalde, Guadalupe's
shift isn't till 6pm.

197
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:12,030
It's totally crazy here. She
might have called in earlier,

198
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:14,101
Come in early, I don't know.
But I haven't seen her.

199
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:16,101
OK. Thank you.

200
00:15:29,203 --> 00:15:32,143
Somebody please! Help me!

201
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:35,180
I need to get out of here!

202
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:37,802
Help!

203
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:43,022
It's locked! Help me, please!

204
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:48,415
Help me!

205
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,886
Please.

206
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,585
Mrs. Martinez!

207
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:59,092
Oh, there you are, young boy.

208
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:01,778
The keys! Give me the keys.

209
00:16:01,808 --> 00:16:06,171
My dad gave me the keys.
Do you want to go back downstairs?

210
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,842
My daughter, my Nora,

211
00:16:08,872 --> 00:16:11,871
they've taken her. I must go to her!

212
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:14,302
No, she left on her own.
She's coming back.

213
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,938
- They're all coming back!
- They never come back! Never!

214
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:25,480
We must leave this place!

215
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,107
Please!

216
00:16:27,137 --> 00:16:29,373
- I need to get out of here!
- If I...

217
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:30,986
If I go get you cigarettes,

218
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:33,588
will you go downstairs and wait for me?

219
00:16:51,356 --> 00:16:52,908
Why the World Trade Center?

220
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:54,910
The Master is drawn to places

221
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,737
of great human misery.
He seeks out suffering.

222
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,017
Eau de strigoi.

223
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:04,726
I think we're in the right place.

224
00:17:08,183 --> 00:17:11,359
"The cave you fear to enter...

225
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:14,429
... Holds the treasure that you seek."

226
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:27,642
Oh, God!

227
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:30,433
With any luck, Dr. Martinez,

228
00:17:30,463 --> 00:17:33,064
it's gonna get a hell of
a lot messier than this.

229
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:36,577
Stay to the right!

230
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:39,408
The third rail.

231
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:42,809
I don't know if it's live
down here, but, uh...

232
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:47,257
That's 625 volts, we
don't want to find out.

233
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,201
It's everything that
defined these people.

234
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,451
Well, I hope I'm defined

235
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,834
by more than just my wallet
and my wristwatch.

236
00:19:12,864 --> 00:19:14,924
Everything you see represents
somebody's mother,

237
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,604
- father, son, daughter.
- Don't bother.

238
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:51,268
Following either a grey Ford 
or a Plymouth...

239
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,726
We're looking at two male
caucasians moving South...

240
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:00,102
Hey!

241
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:03,001
Does your phone work?
Can you get a signal?

242
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,321
No, mine doesn't work either.

243
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:19,162
The station was abandoned after 9/11...

244
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,753
Doubt anyone's been here since.

245
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,533
Anyone still human that is.

246
00:20:57,426 --> 00:20:59,357
They're nesting.

247
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:02,476
During daylight hours, always.

248
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:04,629
Especially when first turned.

249
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:06,831
The, uh, transformation,

250
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:09,734
it exhausts them.

251
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:12,537
That's a lot of necks to chop.

252
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:14,038
No.

253
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,955
Releasing them...

254
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:19,677
would alert the Master
to our presence. Switch off.

255
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:49,278
Kelly?

256
00:21:57,298 --> 00:21:59,417
Eph, it's not her.

257
00:22:03,784 --> 00:22:05,994
We must keep moving.

258
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:36,088
I should have been there for you, Mama.

259
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,956
Mr. Farrell...

260
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:14,407
You're here for the rent, puto?

261
00:23:20,247 --> 00:23:22,493
Look. The rails are clean here.

262
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:24,736
Ah, service cars.

263
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:28,610
They use the abandoned
stations for turnarounds.

264
00:23:30,163 --> 00:23:32,974
I know these tunnels like
the back of my hand.

265
00:23:33,004 --> 00:23:36,700
Now, this line was built
on top of the old original

266
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,984
1923 line.

267
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,013
Yeah, it's like, uh...

268
00:23:41,043 --> 00:23:43,701
Ancient Rome or the City of David.

269
00:23:43,731 --> 00:23:45,523
Shhh!

270
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:49,832
We were hearing that the whole time, Doc.

271
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,817
No, no, this is different.

272
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:54,999
These tunnels, they do

273
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,999
strange things to sounds. You know, 
like whispering chambers.

274
00:23:58,029 --> 00:23:59,643
You know?

275
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:02,800
If there's a train coming,
we're gonna know it, OK?

276
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,127
Come on.

277
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,947
- Go!
- Run!

278
00:24:19,944 --> 00:24:21,843
You were saying?

279
00:24:23,198 --> 00:24:25,671
"I know these tunnels
like the back of my hand."

280
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:27,498
For future reference, that's
the back of your hand.

281
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:31,206
- That's your ass. That's your elbow.
- You want to take lead, yeah?

282
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,004
Take point? Then go ahead.
Be my guest. Go for it, Doc.

283
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:37,381
I'm sick of this Brooklyn-pride shit.
Save it for somebody who cares.

284
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:39,410
You're used to having
the last word, huh, Doc?

285
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,614
How does it feel to know
that a pawnbroker

286
00:24:41,644 --> 00:24:43,897
and a rat killer know
more than you do, huh?

287
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:45,239
You've been waiting for this
your whole life, haven't you?

288
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:47,870
Congratulations on
the vampire apocalypse.

289
00:24:48,911 --> 00:24:50,555
The first will be last.

290
00:24:50,585 --> 00:24:53,410
- The last shall be first, Doc.
- Enough!

291
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,974
Both of you! Pay attention!

292
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:14,078
We cannot afford to be seen.

293
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,416
Not yet.

294
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:31,262
It's a shitty way to go, even for them.

295
00:25:32,942 --> 00:25:35,350
Now, I know another way to kill them.

296
00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:38,706
Next outing, you carry
the power transformer.

297
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:43,343
She was heading this way, so we're close.

298
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:45,035
Just be careful.

299
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:49,528
... they'll get any
better. Widespread looting.

300
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:52,758
- Emergency services stretched.
- Hello?

301
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:55,719
Infrastructure's crumbling,
and there are serious concerns

302
00:25:55,749 --> 00:25:59,188
that hydro and water services
are in imminent danger of collapse.

303
00:25:59,218 --> 00:26:01,869
Added to that, last night's events,

304
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:04,424
on the George Washington's
Bridge particularly,

305
00:26:04,807 --> 00:26:07,509
has sparked concerns over
a recent wave of vigilantism

306
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:09,846
that has spread panic
over law-abiding citizens.

307
00:26:09,876 --> 00:26:12,534
And many citizens have
actually decided to pull up

308
00:26:12,564 --> 00:26:15,156
stakes and get out of town.
We have one such gentleman

309
00:26:15,186 --> 00:26:17,245
on the line right now. Marcus...

310
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,662
Ohhh, jackpot!

311
00:26:22,692 --> 00:26:24,348
Sloppy seconds is more like it.

312
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,436
But food's food.

313
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:29,502
Check the cash register just in case.

314
00:26:29,532 --> 00:26:32,252
And grab another bag to fill.
We'll trade what we can't eat.

315
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:34,119
We might not find another
store like this again.

316
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:36,743
Ohhh... Damn!

317
00:26:37,035 --> 00:26:39,958
Hey, Val, the clerk, he, uh...

318
00:26:40,158 --> 00:26:42,894
Don't be such a pussy.
You want to eat, don't you?

319
00:26:43,077 --> 00:26:45,645
Check the backroom,
look for canned tuna.

320
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:53,100
- Oh, Jesus! Hey!
- Let go of me!

321
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,949
What are you doing here, kid? Hey, Belle!

322
00:27:58,862 --> 00:28:02,028
Where did you come from, kid?

323
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,625
Hey, uh...

324
00:28:03,846 --> 00:28:05,417
Somebody else here.

325
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:16,171
Hey, watch it, kid.

326
00:28:22,894 --> 00:28:24,156
Vamoose.

327
00:28:58,847 --> 00:29:00,815
- Dead-end.
- What the hell?

328
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:04,210
Where did all the vamps
go? Where'd they...

329
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,454
How did they get through?

330
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,591
If I were hunting rats,

331
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:22,033
this is exactly where
I'd assume they'd go.

332
00:29:22,063 --> 00:29:24,071
Or if this is a trap.

333
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:26,311
Goddamn it!

334
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,341
All clear.

335
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:35,576
Shit. Behind us.

336
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:37,331
Go.

337
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:39,692
Hurry. I'll hold them off.

338
00:30:39,722 --> 00:30:41,856
He knows we're here now.

339
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,386
Oh well, all the more reason to hurry.

340
00:31:03,872 --> 00:31:05,461
Eph?

341
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:09,019
Eph?

342
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,179
Doctor!

343
00:31:12,763 --> 00:31:14,590
Eph, are you there?

344
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:16,584
Give me a hand.

345
00:31:18,466 --> 00:31:20,187
Dr. Goodweather!

346
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:23,224
I'm so cold.

347
00:31:23,254 --> 00:31:25,434
Find me, Eph, I need you.

348
00:31:25,464 --> 00:31:27,699
- Kelly?
- Don't!

349
00:31:28,028 --> 00:31:31,506
- Listen to me!
- Don't let them hurt me.

350
00:31:32,401 --> 00:31:33,398
Doctor!

351
00:31:33,428 --> 00:31:34,713
No!

352
00:31:36,821 --> 00:31:38,720
Listen to me!

353
00:31:41,964 --> 00:31:44,661
- Doctor!
- Something's happening.

354
00:31:45,118 --> 00:31:47,904
Holding them off with the
light isn't gonna get it done.

355
00:31:56,885 --> 00:31:58,796
Go! Go now!

356
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:00,049
Go!

357
00:32:04,683 --> 00:32:06,053
Eph!

358
00:32:27,242 --> 00:32:28,158
Eph!

359
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:34,049
Eph?

360
00:33:01,949 --> 00:33:05,412
Gah! Gaaah!

361
00:33:12,026 --> 00:33:13,453
Gah!

362
00:33:13,854 --> 00:33:16,028
- Ah! I'm stuck!
- Go! Go!

363
00:33:21,462 --> 00:33:23,897
Aaah!

364
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,216
Where are they?

365
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:46,527
Let's go.

366
00:33:57,714 --> 00:33:58,882
Eph?

367
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:35,072
Eph, where are you? Hurry.

368
00:34:35,102 --> 00:34:37,037
Kelly, I'm here.

369
00:34:46,953 --> 00:34:50,533
Where is she? Goddamn it, come on!

370
00:34:50,864 --> 00:34:53,353
What are you waiting for?! Come on!

371
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,839
Aaah!

372
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:16,109
Ugh! Ugh!

373
00:35:20,982 --> 00:35:25,187
Have you come here to destroy me?

374
00:35:27,013 --> 00:35:30,257
The old professor...

375
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:32,226
has a new pupil...

376
00:35:34,316 --> 00:35:38,727
to fail... as he failed.

377
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:44,228
I have taken everything

378
00:35:44,258 --> 00:35:46,513
from him.

379
00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:49,180
And I...

380
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,179
will take everything...

381
00:35:52,669 --> 00:35:54,157
from you.

382
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:57,303
Your wife...

383
00:35:58,874 --> 00:36:00,646
your son.

384
00:36:02,749 --> 00:36:04,539
I...

385
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,160
am a drinker of men.

386
00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:18,893
Professore.

387
00:36:46,376 --> 00:36:49,169
Mrs. Martinez!

388
00:36:53,427 --> 00:36:55,175
Mrs. Martinez?

389
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:00,842
Mrs. Martinez?

390
00:37:08,448 --> 00:37:10,557
Mrs. Martinez?

391
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:15,456
I got your cigarettes.

392
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,529
Oh, thank you!

393
00:37:23,522 --> 00:37:25,739
Sweet young boy.

394
00:37:53,497 --> 00:37:56,942
Did anyone see? Which way did he go?

395
00:37:56,972 --> 00:37:59,882
- Which path?
- Eph.

396
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:03,181
- We had him.
- No, he had us.

397
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:04,926
Are you OK?

398
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:07,021
I think so.

399
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:10,250
- You saw him?
- Yeah, I saw him.

400
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:12,724
I heard her voice.

401
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,722
Kelly.

402
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:18,126
She was calling out to me.

403
00:38:19,094 --> 00:38:22,029
- He tricked me.
- Of course, he tricked you!

404
00:38:22,213 --> 00:38:23,948
How could you run off like that?

405
00:38:23,978 --> 00:38:27,551
Hmm? We ended up hunting
for you instead of that thing!

406
00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:30,893
Why did you ignite the light
bomb? It chased him away!

407
00:38:30,923 --> 00:38:32,674
- We had no choice!
- He was right there!

408
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:36,009
Right within my grasp! Now gone!

409
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:44,769
I'll not rest until the Master is destroyed!

410
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:48,112
And now, neither will he!

411
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,227
I'll break you, you...

412
00:38:54,295 --> 00:38:56,463
strigoi!

413
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:59,057
Kill you! Die, you!

414
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:02,038
Die, strigoi!

415
00:39:05,774 --> 00:39:07,180
Die!

416
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,572
This way!

417
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,047
How did you know he went this way?

418
00:39:21,077 --> 00:39:23,554
The Master is here somewhere.

419
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:26,070
We should think this out, regroup.

420
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,700
And let them regroup?
Why would we do that?

421
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,535
We may not get this chance again.

422
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,609
- Goddamn it!
- Tough choice here, huh?

423
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,773
That's basically a random choice.

424
00:39:50,803 --> 00:39:51,924
No.

425
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:54,079
Whoa, look... I get it,

426
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:55,851
I'm on your side, but this is crazy.

427
00:39:55,881 --> 00:39:59,392
We've got him on the run! We
must press on! Do what you like!

428
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,357
- Stop!
- Hold on!

429
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:03,273
Flashlights off.

430
00:40:03,303 --> 00:40:04,693
UV only.

431
00:40:04,723 --> 00:40:06,099
Huh?

432
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:11,583
You see?

433
00:40:11,613 --> 00:40:14,236
I was right! Now, let me go!

434
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:17,487
Stop! Wait. Nora.

435
00:40:17,517 --> 00:40:19,633
What are we waiting for?

436
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:42,802
That's a lot of monsters.

437
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:45,896
No way, Pops!

438
00:40:45,926 --> 00:40:48,143
He is here! Unhand me!

439
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:50,198
For God's sake, this is suicide!

440
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:53,285
No! No! No! No!

441

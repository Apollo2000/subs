- <i> Previously on</i> The Strain.
- Hello, Ms. Velders.

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:08,040
- An old, rich guy hired us
to crash most Internet traffic.

3
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:10,776
- Eldritch Palmer.
- I never wanted to hurt people.

4
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:13,379
- What the hell
happened to you?

6
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,357
- He is nesting somewhere
in the city. We could find him

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,326
<i>if we work together.</i>

8
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:30,362
- I am a drinker of men.

9
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:42,708
- Why did you ignite the light
bomb?! - We had no choice!

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,211
- He was right there!
Right within my grasp!

11
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:50,315
- No way, Pops.
- He is here! Unhand me!

12
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,151
- For God's sake,
this is suicide!

13
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:55,821
- No! No! No! No!

14
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:10,002
- Your pulse is slowing...

15
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:12,204
and your heart
is struggling, Eldritch.

16
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,273
I can hear it.

17
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,943
- Is he here now?

18
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,345
- Oh, no,

19
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,881
I came here on my own.

20
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:27,286
- I've kept my part
of the agreement;

21
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,621
the Master will keep his.

22
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:33,058
- He will not be compelled

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,060
or coerced.

24
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:38,430
He is the Master.

25
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,867
He does...

26
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,936
or he does not.

27
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,605
- I used every resource

28
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,607
at my disposal.

29
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,642
No one else could have done
his bidding

30
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,312
as I have.

31
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:57,449
- And if he denies you
what you want?

32
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,820
What if he sent me instead...

33
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:05,290
in order to offer you
your last rites?

34
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,460
- He will save me.

35
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,296
He still needs me.

36
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:15,000
I have faith.

37
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:55,174
- Zack, we're back!

38
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,211
Zack, we're back.
- Dad!

39
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,348
- Ah!

40
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,185
I'm so sorry we didn't come back
when I said we would.

41
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,356
- It's alright.
Did you get him?

42
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,293
- No. I got close.

43
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:18,297
I guess close
doesn't count, though.

44
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,635
- Finally.

45
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,539
- Everything OK here?

46
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,409
- Yep. Fine.

47
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,945
- Sure?
- Yep.

48
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,888
- Please,

49
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,124
give me strength.

50
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,539
- 500<i> lek.</i>
- Sir, no.

51
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,576
- 800<i> lek.</i> I'm just
taking her up the river.

52
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,378
- No, no.

53
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,713
- It's not the price, is it?
It's the destination.

54
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:45,417
The castle? The ruins?
Has anyone else

55
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,486
enquired about
Castle Drisht recently?

56
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:51,156
<i>Kalaja e Drishtit?</i> A German?

57
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,558
Well-dressed?
Only comes at night?

58
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,630
Are there any people
missing from the villages?

59
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,601
2000<i> lek.</i>

60
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,603
I buy her.

61
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:07,072
2000.

62
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,092
Miriam!

63
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:29,094
That farmer was terrified.

64
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:32,364
He could sense an evil presence.

65
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,466
We're so close
this time, so close.

66
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:37,636
- Abraham, you have said
these words before.

67
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,705
- He's here, I know it.

68
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:44,142
A victory here would validate
our lives' work

69
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,144
and avenge the deaths
of Frankel and Jurgis,

70
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,780
and shame those
who have denounced us.

71
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,452
The castle is a half-day's ride.

72
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,954
I'll be back before sundown.

73
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,323
- Promise me...

74
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,359
if you see signs of nesting,

75
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:03,061
you will get away.

76
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,197
You should not do this alone.

77
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,834
- I'm never alone, Miriam.

78
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:11,036
You're with me every step.

79
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,674
- Please, Abraham...

80
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,743
do not let vengeance cloud

81
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,845
your vision.
- I know your heart,

82
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:23,415
I know the toll my obsessions
have taken on our lives

83
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,977
and the sacrifices
you have made.

84
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,722
After this is finished,

85
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,858
we'll settle down in peace.

86
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,927
We'll adopt.

87
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:39,331
A boy and girl, yes?

88
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,400
Just like
you've always wanted.

89
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:49,508
- Until sundown.

90
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,743
No later.

91
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,130
- Next time.

92
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:15,233
- Do you know how long
I have hunted him?

93
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:18,703
My last encounter with him
was... decades ago.

94
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,473
There may be no next time.

95
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:25,243
- You should rest.
- Please,

96
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,712
Dr. Martinez, leave me alone.

97
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:34,085
- What is this?

98
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,421
Is this a vampire heart?

99
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:39,991
How did you... How old is it?

100
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,894
- I asked you
to leave me alone.

101
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,730
- You've kept it here, why?
- STOP with your questions!

102
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,789
- Mr. Alonzo Creem.
You remember me?

103
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,625
- Yeah, I remember you.

104
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:16,127
- Give me your gun.

105
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,296
You think I'm playing with you?!
Give me your gun!

106
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,665
Slowly.

107
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,005
Now, start the car and drive.

108
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,645
- Best approximation,
we were right

109
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,114
about here when we saw that
horde of vamps in the tunnel.

110
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,817
- A radius of half a block
in either direction.

111
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,319
- Yeah.

112
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,522
- OK, is nobody gonna
bring this up but me?

113
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,557
You guys saw what happened
with Setrakian back there.

114
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,160
- Oh... He was upset.
It's understandable.

115
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,162
- Upset?

116
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,164
He wanted the four of us
to take on

117
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,401
maybe a thousand vampires. That
did happen. You saw that, right?

118
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,904
- He's been on this hunt
for a long time, Doc.

119
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:02,407
- So, it was just
a senior moment?

120
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,576
Is nobody questioning this
but me?!

121
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:08,179
- I think you're overreacting.
- I hear you,

122
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,148
but what choice do we have?

123
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,250
- OK, good to know.
So it is just me.

124
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:20,592
- Would you look at that?

125
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,868
- Miss me?

126
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,337
- Now that you mention it.

127
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,344
Run out!

128
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:49,207
Nothing is working!

129
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,460
- What happened?

130
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,729
Is everyone OK?

131
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,898
- As good as can be expected.

132
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,234
Did you bring us some pizzas
in there or what?

133
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:06,571
- Better. I brought you a plan.

134
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:10,241
- We don't need any more plans;
what we need is a win.

135
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,644
- OK then.

136
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,813
I've brought you a win.

137
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:24,089
I'm gonna set up here, OK?

138
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,091
- Where did you steal
that stuff from?

139
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:29,127
- Look, I get it, yeah.
We're never gonna be best mates.

140
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,630
It breaks my heart, truly,

141
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,265
but you need me
even if you don't know it yet.

142
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,501
- Oh, is this the time where
I remind you that you broke

143
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,471
the Internet?

144
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,640
- Ever heard of
the Emergency Alert System?

145
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,309
- It's that thing that always
interrupts the radio

146
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,412
and television. Now,
"This is only a test," right?

147
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:50,148
- Established to allow the
president to address the nation

148
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,817
in a time of war
or national crisis,

149
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,787
for 50 years
throughout various incarnations.

150
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,789
It's never been used,
not once.

151
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,791
Not even on 9-11.

152
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,460
- Well, that's because we have
24-hour news stations now.

153
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:05,764
- Broadcasting bullshit stories
about strange influenzas,

154
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,932
random violence,
celebrity weddings...

155
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,001
- I can cut
through all that noise.

156
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,671
Broadcast, cable, satellite,
I can put you

157
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:16,441
on every television and radio
in this country, unfiltered

158
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,276
and uncensored.

159
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,851
- I'm an escaped fugitive
wanted for murder,

160
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,020
who's going to believe me?

161
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,022
- Use that notoriety, Doc.

162
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,024
People know who you are,

163
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,026
that you worked for the CDC.

164
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,362
Make some noise.
Get people talking!

165
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,364
- Hmm, with your charm,

166
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,466
the sky's the limit.

167
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:44,202
- It actually could work.

168
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,372
- Not could, it will.

169
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,709
Now, figure out what you can say
in about 30 to 40 seconds

170
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,911
to wake up the world.

171
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,653
What's your name again?

172
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,055
- They call me Gus.

173
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,725
- I'm just curious. Hmm.

174
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,561
Why take me off among all
the people you can go after?

175
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,563
- Well, I needed guns,

176
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,765
ammo, money;

177
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,668
you seemed like a safe bet.
- Whoa, what do you think

178
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,571
you know about me?
- I know enough.

179
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,941
- Here's the problem, "Gus,"

180
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,909
I have a lot of friends,

181
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,911
friends that want
to do me favors;

182
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,913
and once you steal from me,

183
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,915
a lot of people are going
to want to get on my good side

184
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,352
by finding you.

185
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:37,255
- You take a look
around the city, brah?

186
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,591
A plague broke out,

187
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:43,261
turning people
into killing machines.

188
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,263
There's about to be
a whole lot of chaos,

189
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,565
ain't nobody finding me.

190
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,969
You got a plan
in that head of yours?

191
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,071
'Cause it better
come out just as quick.

192
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:55,940
You feel me?

193
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,176
- No problem.

194
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,888
//

195
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,380
-<i> Profesoara.</i>

196
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,528
- Miriam!

197
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,532
- You have been
hunting too long, Jew.

198
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,768
I knew you would not be able

199
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,604
to resist such an inviting trap.

200
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,207
- Eichhorst!

201
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:32,443
- I leave you here
to ponder your mistakes.

202
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,679
- No! Eichhorst!

203
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,282
Eichhorst!

204
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,119
Come back and face me!

205
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,791
- That's gonna go

206
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,893
all the way up there, huh?

207
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:54,098
- Yeah.

208
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,634
I'm gonna fool the system
into thinking it's receiving

209
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,769
the weekly "This is only
a test" test.

210
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:02,006
And then it's lights,
camera, Dr. Serious.

211
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,108
- You can do
all that from here?

212
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,146
- Not here. This... hunk
of consumer electronics

213
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,648
is just a dumb
sending-receiving unit;

214
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,984
bypassing the satcom encryption

215
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,153
from my laptop, now that's
gonna be the tricky part.

216
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,221
That is an NSA-level hack.

217
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,152
- How did you get started
doing all this stuff?

218
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,762
- It's a long story,
some other time.

219
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:28,499
- I assume that you answered
an ad in<i> Misfits Quarterly.</i>

220
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,035
You know, some
correspondence course

221
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:33,037
for antisocial anarchists.

222
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,972
- Where?

223
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,542
My dad worked
for New York Telephone

224
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,677
tracing phone phreakers.

225
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,547
And then the phone
monopoly broke up,

226
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,650
and he moved
into cybersecurity.

227
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:48,653
Right about the time phreakers
were turning into hackers.

228
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:51,155
- You rebelled
against Pops, huh?

229
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,691
- No. No, I loved my dad.

230
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,461
He used to go undercover

231
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,530
to these hackathons
and take me along.

232
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,200
He saw that hackers

233
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:06,204
were more curious
than malicious.

234
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:09,006
Had he, uh,
been born a few years later,

235
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,075
he would have been one, too.

236
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:14,912
- Uh, well, wait a second.

237
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:18,382
What you did to the Internet,
that was, uh...

238
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,551
that was plenty malicious.

239
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,289
- Yeah, well, I lost my way.

240
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:30,695
- That's why you came back?
To fix things?

241
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,399
- That and...
I left a really good

242
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,902
pair of boots here.

243
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:41,606
- Ha! Hmm!

244
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,774
You know, I'm pretty good
at New York accents,

245
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,310
but yours, I can't
seem to place.

246
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:51,582
- I met a London girl,
moved across the ocean for her.

247
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,585
- It's love, I guess.

248
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,992
- My dad died when I was 12
of a heart attack.

249
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,463
My mom took it pretty hard,

250
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:09,233
married too quickly
to a pompous shithead.

251
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,569
Things were pretty bad
after that,

252
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:13,938
and I left home when I was 15.

253
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,307
So much for love.

254
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,846
More details you require?

255
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,651
- Only one.

256
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,622
Men or women?

257
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,593
- I specialize in passionate,

258
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:39,063
destructive relationships.

259
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:41,999
- The best kind.

260
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:50,341
- And we're up.

261
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:51,909
- Alright.

262
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,022
- You are preparing a speech?

263
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,191
- Yes, I am, Mrs. Martinez.

264
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,959
A very important speech.

265
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:12,663
- My Nora was first in her class
at public speaking.

266
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,800
She won every debate
at school.

267
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:18,369
And most of them at home.

268
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,371
- She still does.
- Mama?

269
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:23,541
- She's here in the kitchen.
- Why aren't you in bed?

270
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:27,278
I came to check on you.
- I couldn't sleep. The noises,

271
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,714
the sirens, it...

272
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:32,116
- No, no, no. No more smoking.

273
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,285
Come on, go to sleep.

274
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:39,457
I'll sleep with you tonight, OK?

275
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,533
The mother is the daughter;
and the daughter is the mother.

276
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,236
- It's how life goes, huh?

277
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,892
- Yeah, buddy.

278
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,838
Go easy, man! Easy!

279
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,673
You'll get your head knocked on.

280
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,880
- I got an AR-15,

281
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:39,450
MP-5 and a couple
of pistols. Now, take

282
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:42,420
and leave. Never ever
let me see your face again.

283
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,524
- Yo, who's that?
- Nobody.

284
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,659
- Creem, who's that?!

285
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,265
- Look, just a delivery
I'm expecting. I'll handle it.

286
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,400
He'll be in and out
in two minutes.

287
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:59,470
- Get him out of here.

288
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,608
- Greg, come on in.

289
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:11,816
Don't worry about him.

290
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:14,919
He works for me. Logistics.

291
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:17,087
- We dropped the container

292
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,123
this afternoon. Spot D-42.

293
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,593
- Yeah, good, good. It will be
shipped out in the morning.

294
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:25,229
- Any problem, let me know.
- Of course, my brother.

295
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:27,398
You have a good night.

296
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:34,872
- Yo-yo-yo! Yo-yo!
Let me see what's in the bag.

297
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:39,510
What's in the bag, brah?

298
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,655
Now, that's what
I'm talking about, Creem!

299
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,625
- Look, you got your guns.
Get that shit

300
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:56,627
and get the hell out of here
while you still got a chance.

301
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:59,096
- If that dude is willing
to pay you this much

302
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,098
to ship some containers,

303
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,100
then what's in there
has got to be worth

304
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,369
a whole hell of a lot more
than what's in here.

305
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:08,105
So I want to take a look-see.

306
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:16,480
- Ready for your close-up?

307
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:19,116
- Do you think we should maybe
do this in the morning

308
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,118
when people are awake?
- They can override

309
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,621
our feed in the TV-station
control booth. We want

310
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:25,623
to exploit the inexperience
of the overnight shift.

311
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,892
An extra 10 seconds
of airtime can be critical,

312
00:25:27,894 --> 00:25:31,328
so put the good stuff
at the top, yeah?

313
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,198
<i>- ...protect us.
- Where are they?</i>

314
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,500
<i>Here, they're all vulnerable.
They're not idiots.</i>

315
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:39,036
<i>Really? You think
more guns on our streets</i>

316
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,372
<i>is the answer? I can't think
of anything less likely</i>

317
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:43,374
<i>to curb the current crime spree
than decrease</i>

318
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,409
<i>the number of bullets in here,
but thank you...</i>

319
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:48,646
- 40 years ago,
I came to this country...

320
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:51,549
defeated.

321
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:54,385
I had dedicated my life
to hunting the Master

322
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:57,321
and his ilk,
but at that moment, I...

323
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,325
...I turned my back
on that quest.

324
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,863
The, uh... evil

325
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:07,898
that had presided
over this world

326
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,267
for so many centuries

327
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:14,772
had withdrawn into the shadows
once again, and I...

328
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:17,508
I felt I had missed my chance.

329
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,577
- But still...

330
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,879
we've been in your basement,

331
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:25,049
the weapons, your books...

332
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:27,384
you've prepared.

333
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,954
- I prepared, yes,

334
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:32,456
but I had resigned myself

335
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,592
to the reality that I would pass
from this world

336
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,928
without ever facing him again.

337
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,130
Seeing the Master

338
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,633
in the tunnels
after all that time, I, uh...

339
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:46,236
I lost perspective.
I realize that now.

340
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:49,540
I reacted with
raging impulses, and anger,

341
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:53,644
and emotion. I...

342
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:55,646
I apologize.

343
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:58,949
But...

344
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:03,487
...I have rested
and I'm ready to...

345
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:06,657
press ahead with the fight.

346
00:28:39,652 --> 00:28:44,321
Miriam!
Miriam!

347
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,948
- OK, get ready. And make sure
the volume's turned off

348
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,250
so it doesn't feedback.

349
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:30,367
- Oh, my God! Eph, it's working!

350
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,369
Go! Go, Eph!

351
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,571
- My name is
Dr. Ephraim Goodweather.

352
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:37,141
This is not a test.

353
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:40,410
I'm an epidemiologist from
the Centers for Disease Control.

354
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:43,113
I'm here to warn you
of an urgent danger.

355
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:46,083
There is a disease spreading
through New York City

356
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:48,085
and possibly beyond.

357
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:51,255
This plague is responsible for
the mysterious disappearances

358
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:54,792
we've been seeing.
These photographs show

359
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:57,594
an autopsy I performed
on one of the victims.

360
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,963
This strain,

361
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,065
this virus changes

362
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,301
its host body
through a violent,

363
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,771
corruptive metamorphosis.
You can see a bizarre growth

364
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:11,341
emanating from the throat
forming a kind of stinger

365
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:15,312
through which a worm parasite
passes from the carrier

366
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,648
to the victim. In fact,

367
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,850
your loved ones,
once they are turned,

368
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:22,586
once they are infected,
will come after you.

369
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:25,189
Sunlight kills these...
- That's it.

370
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,858
It's off. They stopped it.
- Woo!

371
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,460
We did it! Bloody hell!

372
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:33,197
- We did it, it worked!
<i>- Toaster oven, too!</i>

373
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:43,674
- Mama, I'm coming!

374
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,212
No! Mama!

375
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:51,048
Mama!

376
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,350
Mama!

377
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:58,021
- Get downstairs, now!

378
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,964
- Mama!

379
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:08,866
- Get down to the basement now!

380
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,942
Hurry up! Go! Go!

381
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:45,235
- Time is up, 8230385!

382
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,573
- Come on, keep moving, brah.

383
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,575
Ain't no walk in the park,

384
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,744
taking your time and shit.

385
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:56,513
Is this it?

386
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,582
So open it.

387
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,385
- I can't, man.
They don't give me a key.

388
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:03,687
All I do is ship it.

389
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:06,523
Damn!
- Now, open it.

390
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:13,030
- Shit! What the hell?

391
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:19,770
What is it, man?

392
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:22,539
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

393
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:25,842
Give me the gun!
Hurry! Hurry!

394
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,187
- Bitch! Oh, it's like that? Yo!
You wanna play like that, uh?

395
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:51,234
- Oh.

396
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,644
Grrr!

397
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,012
Damn it!

398
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:12,556
That's for shooting me.
- Ugh.

399
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:26,003
- Uh-uh! No, don't.

400
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,508
Not him! Him!

401
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,946
Who the hell
are you, huh? Huh?

402
00:33:35,948 --> 00:33:38,215
Get off me!
Get your hands off me!

403
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,517
Get off me!

404
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,854
Hey, get your hands off me!

405
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,856
Will you take your...

406
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,958
Oh! Hey!

407
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,526
- We need to go.

408
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:24,861
- You're not thinking
of taking them on?

409
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:27,664
- No, that will not work.

410
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,766
I prepared for this,
there's another way out.

411
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:32,202
Secret passage
through the meat locker.

412
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:36,073
- That sounds better.
- I have to agree.

413
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:38,275
Everybody, arm up.

414
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,608
- There will be a time
for condolences,

415
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,811
my dear, but...
now we must flee.

416
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,980
- I can't leave her here.

417
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:22,285
We could take her with us.

418
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,422
Maybe there's a chance.

419
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:27,657
- Go get Zack.

420
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,726
I'll be right there.

421
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:40,237
Go.

422
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:48,612
Give it to me.

423
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:51,681
Give it to me.

424
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:01,525
Go.

425
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,495
Go.

426
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:11,601
- Come on, let's go.

427
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,871
Come on!

428
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:36,026
- AAAAAH!

429
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,240
- It had to be done...

430
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,976
for her.

431
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:47,324
- 8230385!

432
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,062
I know you can hear me.

433
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:56,132
I am coming for you.

434
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,503
Ah.

435
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:35,031
Goodbye, Miriam.

436
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,367
Till we meet again.

437
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:36,526
- Fitzwilliam?

438
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:40,230
Are you there?

439
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:00,383
I knew you'd come.

440
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:02,552
I believed.

441
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:09,526
Save me.

442
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:16,199
- Behold.

443
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:40,256
- Yes!

444
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:42,992
Thank you.

444
00:42:43,305 --> 00:43:43,473

1
00:00:00,357 --> 00:00:04,343
- Previously on The Strain.
- 206 passengers are dead

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:07,011
and we don't know why.
Four passengers survived

3
00:00:07,027 --> 00:00:09,195
- and we don't know why.
- Seal off the perimeter

4
00:00:09,263 --> 00:00:10,703
- of the airport.
- Got it.

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,653
- I said let him through.
- I made a deal with Greg

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,356
to provide some information
and let a piece of medical cargo

7
00:00:15,423 --> 00:00:17,925
- through customs. That's it.
- Here is the rest of the money

8
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:20,394
- Greg promised you in return.
- Tell him that one of

9
00:00:20,462 --> 00:00:22,463
the survivors is very sick. Tell
him we need to corral the rest

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,999
of the survivors and anybody
they've had contact with. Now!

11
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,668
Do you have a complete
passenger manifest with you?

12
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,004
- Not right here. Why?
- Because you need to find

13
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,573
every last passenger and destroy the bodies

14
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:35,409
and anyone in contact with them.

15
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:37,978
- This is Gary Arnot.
- Thank you for sending

16
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:40,014
- my little girl home to me.
- Are you saying someone

17
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,750
- released her body to you?
- No, not her body..

18
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:44,785
Emma's alive. She showed up
on my doorstep this morning.

19
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:49,290
We need to get him into
surgery, find out what's

20
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:51,325
- happening inside him right now.
- Your patient... he's gone.

21
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:54,194
- OK I found him.
- Doyle, what are you doing?

22
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,397
Get away from me. Agh!

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,074

24
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:12,513
Oh my God.

25
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,550
What just happened here?

26
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,519
- You didn't have a choice.
- Did you hear him say my name?

27
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:21,088
- What? No.
- He didn't say anything.

28
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:23,090
- Wish he had.
- The old man said

29
00:01:23,158 --> 00:01:25,459
destroy the head and burn the body.

30
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:27,494
- Should we be doing that?
- What are you saying?

31
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:29,797
Are we burning corpses, now?

32
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:32,433
OK, we have to cut him open
before the whole hospital

33
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,468
- gets down here.
- Cut him open?

34
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:36,837
- We're all going to get arrested.
- It was self-defense.

35
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:39,139
- No one's getting arrested.
- L... let's move him.

36
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:41,275
We have to find a place to do this.

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,682
We gotta call this in.
This is way over our heads.

38
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,951
I just killed this thing, I need to explain

39
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:54,254
- why I did that, Jim.
- I'll go find a room.

40
00:01:58,026 --> 00:02:00,461
Help me move him.

41
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:02,663
Well I just want to go on record
- I do not think

42
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:04,832
that this is a good idea.

43
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:07,334
A monster just tried to murder us.

44
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:10,604
There are no records.

45
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,165
OK, we need a surgical kit,
specimen jars, and rubber bands

46
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:32,200
to seal the gloves.

47
00:02:32,268 --> 00:02:34,269
Jim, stay with the body.

48
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:36,271
- What if it gets up?
- Run.

49
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:38,840
- Funny.
- You run.

50
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,845
But it's not gonna get up, right?

51
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:54,422
Do you think Redfern knew
what was happening to him?

52
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,825
I hope not.

53
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:02,530
Hey, if you need time,
I can do this on my own.

54
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:06,735
No. I want to be there. Find some answers.

55
00:03:06,802 --> 00:03:08,870
Make his death mean something.

56
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,573
Good, 'cause I need you.

57
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:20,215
Ansel?

58
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:22,817
I'm taking the kids to your sister's.

59
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:25,353
Unless... you think I shouldn't.

60
00:03:27,923 --> 00:03:30,058
No. Take them.

61
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,994
Get them out of here as soon as you can.

62
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:39,634
Daddy's not feeling well.
Just go with Mommy, OK?

63
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:44,439
Please, let me call Dr. Barrett.

64
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:46,541
He knows our family,

65
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:50,645
he's not like these government people
- he cares about you.

66
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:54,115
- No. I'm going to rest.
- I'll be fine.

67
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:01,923
Go and wait by the door, please. Go on.

68
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:14,903
Is there anything I can do for you?

69
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,406
No, Annie. Just take care of the kids, OK?

70
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:21,242
Tell them I'm sorry
for being so grumpy, eh?

71
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,514
I'll put Gertie in the shed,
get her out of your way.

72
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:30,552
No. No, leave her.

73
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:33,221
She can keep me company.

74
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:43,391
- Cuz, where's my clock?
- Shut up.

75
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,994
Ha! Ha! Gusto! What up?

76
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:48,396
- _
- What up, bro?

77
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:51,199
- Smells good in here, man.
- I've gotta fatten you up, ×™se.

78
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,635
- I'm hungry.
- Chupo's got you all manorexic.

79
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:56,271
- He! He! He!
- Everybody can't be pretty

80
00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:58,640
- like you, brah.
- That's just the start though.

81
00:05:58,707 --> 00:06:01,075
- Yeah?
- I hear good things.

82
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:04,913
- Thank you, man.
- Cash flow things.

83
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,615
Keep it down, bro.

84
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:10,018
There's this dude in Queens, Alonso Creem.

85
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:12,620
- Mmhm.
- He buys cars.

86
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:14,422
Hear he pays up to a g a pop.

87
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,159
Him and these Nigerians.
This is a sure thing, homie.

88
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:21,229
- For real?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,464
'Cause a sure thing got
me locked up last time.

90
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:30,271
- _
- _

91
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:33,608
- _
- _

92
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:36,744
_

93
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:38,980
- _
- _

94
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:40,882
- _
- _

95
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,217
I got the sweet rolls you like.

96
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:45,520
- I stopped off at the bakery.
- Thank you.

97
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:48,656
- You know how I love this nino?
- Uh huh.

98
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:53,394
Everyday he call me or
came while you were away.

99
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:56,230
- I know.
- Tan lindo, tan lindo mi Felix.

100
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:58,466
Andele.

101
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:01,903
- He bring me groceries. Yeah.
- Stolen from my Pop's shop.

102
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:04,539
- Don't joke.
- I'm not joking.

103
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:06,941
No, no, no. Too much. I
have to watch my weight.

104
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:11,179
- _
- _

105
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:13,548
- _
- _

106
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:21,856
- Thank you, mama.
- DE nada, mi hijo.

107
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:25,426
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

108
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:42,877
Ah. Herr Eichorst.

109
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:45,480
Herr Palmer.

110
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:48,016
Mr. Fitzwilliam, now
that Mr. Eichorst is here,

111
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,119
will you show in our guest?

112
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:56,357
So.

113
00:07:56,425 --> 00:08:00,628
Dutch Velders. A self-described
internet freedom fighter.

114
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:03,564
Claims he can do all we need.

115
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:05,533
Eccentric, but comes highly recommended.

116
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:13,007
Dutch Velders, Mr. Palmer.

117
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:17,311
Hello, Miss Velders.

118
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:19,213
Sorry, nobody said you were a woman.

119
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:22,116
- I get that a lot.
- After the Regis Air

120
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:25,053
catastrophe, the stock markets plummeted.

121
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,522
Then, as we all know,

122
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:31,693
the CEO of Regis Air killed himself.

123
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,430
Now, the online community is
up in arms about corporate greed

124
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:38,966
and corruption
- all those people on that plane dying,

125
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:43,004
the stock market crash
- and the possibility

126
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:45,907
of the suspension of the
nation's air travel...

127
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:52,513
The online group, Citizens
for Liberty, is planning

128
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:54,982
a massive hacking campaign
to crash the websites

129
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,187
of New York City's largest corporations.

130
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:01,956
Is that believable, Ms. Velders?

131
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:05,093
Heh! Anything's possible

132
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,295
if it's motivated by
enough hatred, Mr. Palmer.

133
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,515
But it's gotta be someone really smart,

134
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:12,750
to figure out how to drown servers.

135
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:16,042
Takes time and patience.

136
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,691
But the story is
- the group came to me.

137
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:21,859
I'm the only one who could
slow the internet down

138
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,896
to worse than dial-up. If
there is someone else can,

139
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,932
- I taught them.
- She wants credit for it.

140
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,336
And, I also want money.

141
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:34,472
Must be so slow that sending
photos or instant anything

142
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,542
is impossible.

143
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,111
Sure.

144
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,780
It's much harder to hide evil
shit these days, isn't it?

145
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:51,923
- Are we doing this?
- Yes, you're hired.

146
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,692
Thank you for coming in.

147
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,265
Jim, record video. Use
my phone, but be careful.

148
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:02,300
- Don't get near the blood.
- There's not a chance

149
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,370
- of that happening.
- What happened to the worms?

150
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:08,306
I don't know but look at this.

151
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,709
These folds, they seem functional.

152
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,779
Vestibular folds. If
the body temperature rose

153
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,782
a lot of heat would be
released through there.

154
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:33,631
His uh, genitals are... gone.

155
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:38,269
Uh, his excreting organs
have fused into a cloaca.

156
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:42,240
- Do I even want to know?
- Uh, reptiles, birds

157
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,844
other lower animals... their
urine and feces are all expelled

158
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,881
- through the same opening.
- Oh, that's adorable.

159
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:52,817
It's efficient.

160
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,186
Let's open him up.

161
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,915
Jim, get closer. Film this.

162
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:28,152
Lungs have dried up.

163
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:41,599
Label that.

164
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:45,703
Label it as what?

165
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:52,744
Uh, the... heart is all shriveled up.

166
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:56,414
The arteries are necrotic but...

167
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:00,218
these tubular structures appear healthy.

168
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:03,988
It's a new circulatory system.

169
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:08,092
It's... brand-new flesh,

170
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,431
but it's symmetrical. It's
not random or cancerous.

171
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,168
This is a plaque cartilage.

172
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,871
A whole new set of organs

173
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:22,673
has generated to propel this stinger.

174
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,740
Ugh - is that the technical term
for it, is it? Stinger?

175
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:32,316
I feel like I'm choking just looking at it.

176
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,059
Oh god.

177
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,106
Christ! What is that smell?

178
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,445
- Ammonia discharge. Like guano.
- Same as on the plane.

179
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:02,647
- And Bishop's body.
- That's enough.

180
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:05,683
This is disgusting.

181
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:09,287
Just... just call it in, Eph,
goddamit, just call it in!

182
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:11,289
- Jim...
- No, this thing just shot

183
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:13,925
a six foot python out of
its mouth, its dick is gone

184
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:16,794
and it... it just
squirted a shitload of shit

185
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:20,231
all over the table and you've
got your hands everywhere.

186
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,266
I mean, God. What the hell is going on?!

187
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,402
It's a parasitic mechanism.

188
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,071
This is rewriting human biology.

189
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,274
- Why? Why is it doing that?
- So it can reproduce.

190
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:33,044
And consume its host.

191
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,434
Hi Mr. Farrell.

192
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:53,202
I'm gettin' a little tired
comin' up here, Gadaloop.

193
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,174
- I'm sorry.
- You always sorry,

194
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:58,457
but nothin' changes.
How many times do I have

195
00:13:58,481 --> 00:14:00,449
to tell you - don't leave
recyclin' in the hallway.

196
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:03,652
It's a fire hazard.

197
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:06,087
Gus. Hey, there. Didn't
know you were back in town.

198
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:08,123
I thought we were squared up this month.

199
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:11,059
No. Didn't get it...

200
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:22,070
Did you take the rent down?

201
00:14:22,138 --> 00:14:24,306
Yes.

202
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:26,641
I swear.

203
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:29,110
- 'Scuse me, mama. Please.
- OK.

204
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:31,379
If I don't deliver rent checks on time,

205
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:33,582
the owner beats my balls off
Everybody works for somebody,

206
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,584
- right or wrong...
- We're not talking about

207
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:37,919
the rent, now. Now we're
talking about the way

208
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:41,022
you speak to my mother
Yeah, that's funny, huh?

209
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,124
'Cause if she ever

210
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:45,961
tells me you talk to her like that again

211
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:48,930
they're going to find your body

212
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:50,899
in one of those recycling
bins you love so much.

213
00:14:52,568 --> 00:14:54,503
Now here's the rent.

214
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,638
And for next month.

215
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:59,274
You need me, Mano?

216
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,281
Yo.

217
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:09,117
You forgot somethin'.

218
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:15,991
Go green!

219
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:21,329
Now let's go meet that
guy with the Nigerians.

220
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:28,870
Ansel, I'm home!

221
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:33,708
I made it!

222
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:47,055
Ansel?

223
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:50,559
I left this shirt out for you, honey.

224
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:54,763
I thought...

225
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,757
maybe you could get out
of your pajamas today.

226
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:23,491
Huh... did your daddy take you for a walk?

227
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:26,027
That'd be nice.

228
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:28,163
Everybody getting in some air today.

229
00:17:57,186 --> 00:17:59,454
Of whom shall I be afraid?

230
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:05,860
No one.

231
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:07,862
No one. I'm not afraid.

232
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:52,607
Ansel?

233
00:18:56,746 --> 00:18:58,713
Ansel, is that you?

234
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:08,857
Are you alright?

235
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:11,726
Honey, are you hiding from me?

236
00:19:15,898 --> 00:19:18,900
Why did you do that?

237
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:40,522
Mother Mary walk with me.

238
00:19:45,127 --> 00:19:48,496
Ansel? Honey?

239
00:19:53,702 --> 00:19:56,671
What's happened to you?

240
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:59,707
I wanna help you.

241
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:02,544
Let me. Please.

242
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:09,117
- Raaaah!
- Run.

243
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:11,686
Go away. Please, Annie!

244
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,090
Go!

245
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:18,059
Don't come near me. Never come back.

246
00:20:21,831 --> 00:20:24,165
The voice in my head...

247
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:27,569
is telling me to rip your
throat and drink from you.

248
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:30,104
I need you.

249
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:32,807
Lock the door and run, Ann Marie.

250
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,076
No matter what I say.

251
00:20:35,144 --> 00:20:38,046
Please, Annie! Go FAR AWAY!

252
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:41,082
Ahhhh!

253
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:01,628
- I'm closed for the day.
- It's still morning.

254
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:04,931
Thank you for that profound observation.

255
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,900
- Got something for you.
- Not today.

256
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:13,940
Hm.

257
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:16,943
I'm not in the business of
buying my own property back.

258
00:21:17,011 --> 00:21:19,646
I'm returning it to you.

259
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:25,652
Well, I imagine that's the only good news

260
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,088
this day will bring.

261
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:30,590
Well, you're welcome.

262
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:33,860
Asshole.

263
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:37,097
I coulda listened to that old man.

264
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:40,247
Taken the cabinet. Destroyed it.

265
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:43,670
Now it's gone.

266
00:21:43,738 --> 00:21:47,641
There's a disease
spreading through the city.

267
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,444
- What now?
- Well, we get outta here

268
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:55,215
and we... stop this thing.

269
00:21:55,283 --> 00:21:58,251
Somehow. Even if nobody'll help.

270
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,887
How?

271
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:03,790
I don't know.

272
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:10,196
This is my fault.

273
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:13,767
- No, it isn't.
- No, Eph. It is.

274
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,802
I waved that van through

275
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,171
at the airport after you sealed it.

276
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:21,441
I was paid to do it. The box was inside.

277
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,012
What?

278
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,381
- I'm flat broke.
- What does that have to do

279
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:30,850
- with letting the box through?
- Go back.

280
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:36,189
This guy named Gregg Nelson
approached me at a medical

281
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:38,191
convention. I mean he
just wanted to sell the CDC

282
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:40,860
some equipment, some ideas
about government contracts.

283
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:43,196
I mean, I think I was
targeted. I'm... I'm sure.

284
00:22:43,264 --> 00:22:45,632
- Who targeted you?
- They knew about my debt,

285
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,667
alright? They knew about everything that

286
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:50,337
Sylvia was going through. I
don't know how, but they did.

287
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:52,572
I mean, I owed a lot of
money before she got sick.

288
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,541
- But after, with medical bills.
- You have insurance.

289
00:22:54,608 --> 00:22:57,677
Sylvia is dying. The cancer is everywhere.

290
00:22:57,745 --> 00:23:00,547
We ran every treatment they
offered and then we kept going.

291
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:02,615
We did anything that we thought made sense

292
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:04,784
- and the cost was insane.
- Are you saying this epidemic

293
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:06,987
was intentional? That
somebody planned this?

294
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:08,822
- Is that what you're saying?
- I don't know!

295
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:11,524
I don't know. Alright?
They paid me a little bit

296
00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:13,493
of money to do 'em a favour,
alright? And then the favors

297
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:14,894
- kept getting bigger.
- And you waited 'til now

298
00:23:14,962 --> 00:23:16,629
- to tell us?!
- They wanted me to clear a box

299
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:18,732
from the airport. A box!

300
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,769
It was soil. The readings were
negative. It was just soil!

301
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:26,573
I would never hurt anybody.
Come on, you know me!

302
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,675
We've been friends for 10 years
all of us. Come on, please.

303
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:31,511
Where did they take the coffin?

304
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:34,080
- I... I don't know.
- Who's behind all this?

305
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:36,116
Some scary prick this...

306
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:39,119
German guy. He threatened me.

307
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:43,656
Come on. I'm on your team.

308
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:46,559
You might not understand this Eph,

309
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:49,205
but I would do anything
to keep my wife alive...

310
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:54,567
Go to your wife.

311
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:56,536
Call Barnes. Call the police. I don't care.

312
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:58,838
Agh...

313
00:23:58,906 --> 00:24:02,142
You're dead to me.

314
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:12,647
There was nothing I could do.

315
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:19,459
No.

316
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:21,661
Give me the phone.

317
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,754
Nora, please.

318
00:24:49,257 --> 00:24:51,692
I don't know that guy back there.

319
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,727
Think of how desperate he must
have been to do something like...

320
00:24:53,795 --> 00:24:56,396
Please don't make excuses for him.

321
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:58,865
Just trying to imagine if
someone I was in love with

322
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:01,968
was dying. What I'd be capable of doing.

323
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:07,207
We need to find another victim.

324
00:25:07,275 --> 00:25:11,044
Setrakian said he knew
where the bodies were going.

325
00:25:11,112 --> 00:25:13,747
Back to their loved ones.

326
00:25:17,318 --> 00:25:20,520
Emma Arnot. Her father. Jesus...

327
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:22,656
We'll bring her to the
hospital. Run some tests.

328
00:25:22,724 --> 00:25:25,859
Then we'll have video
of both Redfern and her.

329
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:30,731
I'll never get used to this car.

330
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:32,699
You know I traded my Rolex for it back...

331
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:35,302
Yeah. I know. I know.

332
00:26:47,008 --> 00:26:49,042
- Missed you, fool!
- Ha! Ha! Ha!

333
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:54,815
I hope you didn't suffer.

334
00:26:54,882 --> 00:26:57,062
Ansel is sick.

335
00:26:59,587 --> 00:27:03,423
Something... is warping him.

336
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,425
Inside.

337
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:11,131
God only knows what he saw on that plane.

338
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:14,601
God damn airplanes!

339
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:17,971
Like missiles the way they
rip through everything.

340
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:25,178
I asked him. You heard me. But...

341
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:29,015
sometimes you can't...

342
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:31,384
speak about the things you see.

343
00:27:33,788 --> 00:27:36,890
Hello? Ann Marie?

344
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:39,192
Oh my God.

345
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,495
Yeah, hi. Hi. Trip Taylor, from next door.

346
00:27:44,632 --> 00:27:47,500
- Wow. Little winter gardening?
- What do you want, Mr. Taylor?

347
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:49,669
OK, I am officially fed up with this noise.

348
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:52,606
Either you let the dog out so she shuts up,

349
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:54,541
or, I don't know, maybe train her to behave

350
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:57,410
while she's locked in the
shed. This isn't rocket science

351
00:27:57,478 --> 00:28:00,947
It's shameful to own a
pet and not discipline it.

352
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:03,850
Oh, and speaking of filthy
animals, those press people

353
00:28:03,918 --> 00:28:06,586
parked out front used my
mimosa tree as a piss post.

354
00:28:06,654 --> 00:28:08,755
Thank you very much for that.

355
00:28:08,823 --> 00:28:10,790
I don't think you're going to have to worry

356
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:13,560
- about the dog anymore.
- That's what your husband said

357
00:28:13,628 --> 00:28:15,829
the first time your mutt tore up my yard.

358
00:28:15,897 --> 00:28:18,398
What do you mean?

359
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:21,501
She entered my property without permission.

360
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,904
- You hit my dog?
- I didn't say that.

361
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:27,274
OK. I'm calling the police.

362
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:31,011
- This is outrageous.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

363
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:34,381
Please forgive me.

364
00:28:34,448 --> 00:28:36,616
If you want to go in there

365
00:28:36,684 --> 00:28:39,185
and teach her a few things...

366
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:41,321
I don't have the heart for it.

367
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:44,157
You're right about that.

368
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:46,760
Good.

369
00:28:55,636 --> 00:28:57,704
Oh, God. Hey! Hey! Whoa!

370
00:28:57,772 --> 00:28:59,706
Whoa! What are you doing?

371
00:28:59,774 --> 00:29:01,775
What the hell?

372
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:04,544
Ahhh! No! No! Oh my God!

373
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:30,473
Gentlemen, sorry to interrupt.

374
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:36,937
- Does this look like we open?
- Got something to sell.

375
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:41,909
We hear you have a real nice showroom.

376
00:29:41,976 --> 00:29:44,578
- Like to add to it.
- That so?

377
00:29:44,646 --> 00:29:47,114
It's out back.

378
00:29:47,182 --> 00:29:49,483
Look, now's not a good
time, aight? Phones are down.

379
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:52,286
- Internet's not working, just...
- Yeah well we here now.

380
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:56,990
I mean if we ain't good enough
for you to do business with,

381
00:29:57,058 --> 00:30:00,494
- then we out.
- Wait.

382
00:30:00,562 --> 00:30:03,097
It's a brand new Mercedes SUV.

383
00:30:13,274 --> 00:30:15,309
Let's see what you got.

384
00:30:27,188 --> 00:30:30,390
It's colder than a goblin's
ass out here, huh? Ha! Ha!

385
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,894
Do your thang, home boy.

386
00:30:41,469 --> 00:30:43,403
(speaking in African)

387
00:30:43,471 --> 00:30:45,506
What?

388
00:30:47,408 --> 00:30:49,443
_

389
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:53,916
(They continue speaking in African.)

390
00:30:58,486 --> 00:31:00,554
Still got a baby seat in the back.

391
00:31:00,622 --> 00:31:03,257
- No extra charge for that.
- Ha! Ha! Ha!

392
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,228
- Here's 400.
- What's that?

393
00:31:09,564 --> 00:31:12,533
- We heard you pay a thousand.
- 400. You gonna take it or not?

394
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:14,735
- Yeah.
- Nah.

395
00:31:17,238 --> 00:31:19,273
We got other stops to make. Get in.

396
00:31:19,341 --> 00:31:21,508
Get a word with you?

397
00:31:27,282 --> 00:31:29,283
I should beat your big ass.

398
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:31,251
Why you always gotta bring up my ass, man?

399
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:33,954
- Leave my ass out of this.
- We're here, let's finish this.

400
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:36,790
That ugly silver toothed punk could murk us

401
00:31:36,858 --> 00:31:39,593
for 400 lousy ass dollars right now.

402
00:31:43,632 --> 00:31:47,101
- You got your ratchet on you?
- Always ready, homie.

403
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:53,774
We leavin'.

404
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,118
800.

405
00:32:06,254 --> 00:32:08,822
Get a full g next time you come around.

406
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,126
You can bet on that.

407
00:32:20,535 --> 00:32:22,736
Heh! Heh! Heh!

408
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:29,843
Forgive me or waking you,
sir. Your appointment's here.

409
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:34,648
I'm not asleep. It actually
hurts to keep my eyes open.

410
00:32:34,716 --> 00:32:37,518
Sorry.

411
00:32:37,585 --> 00:32:40,154
The delivery is right on
time. Should be here soon.

412
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:43,323
Most of the cell towers in the
city are reporting problems.

413
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:45,325
The top seven Internet
server farms have crashed.

414
00:32:45,393 --> 00:32:47,961
All the social networks have gone dark.

415
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:51,932
Mmhm? That girl is
surprisingly reliable. Huh.

416
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,869
Alright. Show Maggie in.

417
00:33:03,845 --> 00:33:07,548
Secretary Pierson, Mr. Palmer.

418
00:33:07,615 --> 00:33:09,983
Please forgive me, Maggie

419
00:33:10,051 --> 00:33:12,519
- Eldritch.
- I know. Don't worry.

420
00:33:12,587 --> 00:33:15,289
I'll be better soon. Please.

421
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:23,731
I had a phone call from
the White House today,

422
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:26,700
an urgent one. You need to understand

423
00:33:26,768 --> 00:33:30,804
what happened on that flight.
They will never tell you,

424
00:33:30,872 --> 00:33:33,607
but I feel it's imperative you know.

425
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,644
The United States
military removed the bodies

426
00:33:37,712 --> 00:33:40,114
from the morgue. In
the middle of the night.

427
00:33:40,181 --> 00:33:43,684
Why did they do that?

428
00:33:43,752 --> 00:33:46,086
A highly classified biological agent

429
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:48,622
got loose on that airplane.

430
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,359
It was a tragic mistake.
Of epic proportions.

431
00:33:52,427 --> 00:33:55,863
But now we must do what needs to be done.

432
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,266
Without cowardice. Without hesitation.

433
00:34:06,941 --> 00:34:09,276
Those poor people.

434
00:34:11,951 --> 00:34:16,150
What makes you powerful and formidable

435
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:19,586
is also what makes a decision
like this so painful -

436
00:34:19,654 --> 00:34:21,655
your decency.

437
00:34:21,723 --> 00:34:24,458
Maggie,

438
00:34:24,526 --> 00:34:27,394
we need you to put your country first.

439
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:30,464
Not the bullshit country we pretend to be,

440
00:34:30,532 --> 00:34:32,699
the one we really are,

441
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:35,747
the one you're getting to know very well.

442
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,275
I saw that in you from the start -

443
00:34:41,342 --> 00:34:45,512
the potential to get
the game behind the game.

444
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:52,719
I owe you my career, Eldritch.

445
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,458
- Now what about the
bio-agent? - Highly lethal,

446
00:34:58,526 --> 00:35:01,295
but it quickly dissipates;
designed so our troops

447
00:35:01,362 --> 00:35:05,032
can follow it into battle.
That's why no one found it.

448
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:08,669
It's gone. Done.

449
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:13,140
Will you stand with me on this, Maggie?

450
00:35:14,776 --> 00:35:18,412
Yes, I will. Whatever you need.

451
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:24,251
- Are you okay?
- I can't tell you how rare

452
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:26,920
and valuable...

453
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:37,097
- What's going on?
- Where's Maggie?

454
00:35:37,165 --> 00:35:39,366
You passed out, sir.

455
00:35:39,434 --> 00:35:42,035
Once she was certain you were
OK, Secretary Pierson left.

456
00:35:44,372 --> 00:35:46,740
Mr. Palmer. Your new liver is here,

457
00:35:46,808 --> 00:35:49,243
it's in great shape.

458
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,045
We need to prep you for surgery right now.

459
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:56,583
Does Eichorst know what is happening to me?

460
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:59,453
We haven't been able to reach him, sir.

461
00:36:01,656 --> 00:36:05,525
Have they already forgotten
how much they need me?

462
00:36:05,593 --> 00:36:09,429
Why are they doing this?

463
00:36:09,497 --> 00:36:12,933
I was promised a miracle.

464
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:16,011
We have a healthy liver
for you. That's the miracle.

465
00:36:17,538 --> 00:36:21,375
Eldritch, you are in
fulminant hepatic failure.

466
00:36:23,077 --> 00:36:26,179
Yes, yes
- you have my consent. Get on with it.

467
00:36:26,247 --> 00:36:29,378
Excellent. Let's get him into surgery now.

468
00:36:45,064 --> 00:36:47,665
Hello?

469
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:51,002
It's Ephraim Goodweather from the CDC.

470
00:36:53,572 --> 00:36:56,474
Mr. Arnot?

471
00:37:59,004 --> 00:38:01,039
Emma?

472
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:18,523
Arnot! Hey!

473
00:38:18,591 --> 00:38:20,625
Oh God!

474
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:24,662
Ahhh! God!

475
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,865
Move away. He'll be right behind her.

476
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:29,467
They need to find shelter
before the sunrise. Move!

477
00:38:29,535 --> 00:38:31,903
Get out of the way!

478
00:38:36,475 --> 00:38:38,743
Sabia mea fredoneaza de argint.

479
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:44,549
Are you OK? Are you OK?

480
00:38:44,617 --> 00:38:46,551
- Keep away from the bodies.
- The worms, don't let them

481
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:49,387
- touch you.
- What have you done?

482
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:51,856
Among other things, I just saved your life.

483
00:38:51,924 --> 00:38:55,860
- We have resources, protocols.
- Not for this.

484
00:38:55,928 --> 00:38:58,196
There's no other way.

485
00:38:58,264 --> 00:39:00,832
I can't stay down here.

486
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:10,575
There are two containers full
of gasoline in the garage.

487
00:39:10,643 --> 00:39:12,944
We have to finish this.

488
00:39:13,012 --> 00:39:15,647
Burn them.

489
00:39:20,686 --> 00:39:23,588
Nora.

490
00:39:23,656 --> 00:39:26,691
Just... just, no. Don't. Just let me go.

491
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:29,160
No, no, no. Please. Please.

492
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:32,130
We're not doing this.

493
00:39:32,198 --> 00:39:34,465
We were talking about finding a cure.

494
00:39:34,533 --> 00:39:36,668
That was before we knew
how quickly it spreads.

495
00:39:36,735 --> 00:39:38,670
We have to do this with
him. It's our only shot.

496
00:39:38,737 --> 00:39:40,672
- Oh, come on, Eph!
- We don't exterminate

497
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:42,774
our patients when there's an outbreak.

498
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:46,377
The Chinese culled the
bird population in Hong Kong

499
00:39:46,445 --> 00:39:49,414
after the avian flu hit. It
was the responsible thing to do.

500
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:51,883
We're not hunting down human beings.

501
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:54,385
They're hunting us!

502
00:39:54,453 --> 00:39:57,121
Where do you think that blood came from?

503
00:39:57,189 --> 00:40:00,491
Arnot was out there
killing innocent people.

504
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,594
Nora, please...

505
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:11,035
That was a little girl in there.

506
00:40:11,103 --> 00:40:14,105
I mean, how old was Emma? Eight, tops?

507
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:20,178
- She was sick but...
- No. She was gone.

508
00:40:20,246 --> 00:40:24,048
There was something inside her shell.

509
00:40:24,116 --> 00:40:27,885
That was a body controlled by a virus.

510
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:31,356
- This is what we do.
- The people of New York rely

511
00:40:31,423 --> 00:40:34,359
on us to investigate and eliminate

512
00:40:34,426 --> 00:40:37,829
threats to their health. And
now, when it finally means

513
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:40,765
something, we're gonna run?

514
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:44,102
I am not doing this. I'm not.

515
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:47,205
I'd rather die from
whatever this epidemic is

516
00:40:47,273 --> 00:40:50,375
than kill people!

517
00:40:56,749 --> 00:40:59,917
This, it's... not for everyone.

518
00:40:59,985 --> 00:41:02,053
Are you going to murder
everyone on that list of yours?

519
00:41:02,121 --> 00:41:05,990
Yes.

520
00:41:06,058 --> 00:41:08,926
I assume you're not staying with us.

521
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:18,670
No.

522
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:23,241
Please be safe.

523
00:41:25,411 --> 00:41:29,147
Promise me.

524
00:41:29,214 --> 00:41:32,283
There has to be another way.

525
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:43,528
Some brains... can't adjust.

526
00:41:43,595 --> 00:41:47,031
I can see you love her for that...

527
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:49,534
But you have to let her go.

528
00:41:52,705 --> 00:41:54,806
Get the gasoline.

529
00:42:01,747 --> 00:42:07,952

1
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:06,556
Hunger, a poet once said,

2
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:09,993
is the most important thing we know,

3
00:00:09,994 --> 00:00:12,028
the first lesson we learn.

4
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:17,500
But hunger can be easily
quieted down, easily satiated.

5
00:00:19,303 --> 00:00:22,973
There is another force, a
different type of hunger,

6
00:00:22,974 --> 00:00:27,377
an unquenchable thirst
that cannot be extinguished.

7
00:00:27,378 --> 00:00:32,816
It's very existence is what
defines us, what makes us human.

8
00:00:33,985 --> 00:00:35,952
That force is love.

9
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:42,292
Folks, this is your
captain up in the flight deck.

10
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:45,528
We are on our final descent into
New York for an on-time arrival.

11
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:47,764
We want to thank you for flying Regis Air

12
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:49,466
and encourage that you ask us

13
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,701
any connecting gate
information you may need.

14
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:53,570
We're looking at partly cloudy skies

15
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:56,039
and we may hit a little
turbulence on our approach.

16
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,208
Not again.

17
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:02,779
Yes?

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,547
Rose get back here now.

19
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:05,749
I need your help.

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,784
We're landing, whatever it is can wait.

21
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:09,352
Now. Come now!

22
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:11,655
All right, relax.

23
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:18,762
Sir, we're landing.

24
00:01:18,763 --> 00:01:20,997
Would you power off your device?

25
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,365
You call this a device?

26
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:23,933
You have to turn it off.

27
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:27,971
It's like when a cop
calls a car a "vehicle".

28
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:31,875
Or when he calls you sir
when he means "asshole".

29
00:01:31,876 --> 00:01:34,144
Having a little gig in New York coming up.

30
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:36,713
You give me three or four
of those little baby vodkas

31
00:01:36,714 --> 00:01:38,281
I'll get you a front-row seat.

32
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:40,216
Turn it off, put your seat up.

33
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:42,152
We're landing, sir.

34
00:01:45,923 --> 00:01:46,856
Ma'am.

35
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:50,260
Seat backs in the upright position.

36
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:52,128
Finally.

37
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:54,097
Flight attendants,
prepare for landing.

38
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:57,071

39

44
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:13,016
On behalf of the cabin crew,

45
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:15,318
I want to take a moment to say...

46
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,487
Peter, you haven't done anything back here!

47
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:19,122
This place is a mess!

48
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:21,558
There's something in the plane.
-What do you mean?

49
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,060
Something alive in the cargo hold!
-Shh-shh!

50
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,764
We'd like to
extend a special thank you

51
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:30,600
to any Black Platinum Award
mbers flying with us tonight

52
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,402
and encourage all our passengers...

53
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,270
What the hell do you mean, like a dog?

54
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:36,272
No, it's something really, really big.

55
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:37,440
I heard it move.

56
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:39,409
A thumping underneath the floor.

57
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,677
I heard it...

58
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:43,079
No, Peter, there are no
animals on the manifest.

59
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,614
It tried to open the latch.

60
00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:46,316
I heard a noise.

61
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:47,917
Then it moved away.

62
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,786
But you can feel it moving.

63
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:54,424
Flight crew prepare for arrival.

Did you see it?

66
00:03:30,694 --> 00:03:32,662
Nothing. I just think that you were...

67
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:35,665
Oh my God!

68
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,367
Go tell Captain Redfern!

69
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:39,135
Tell him to warn the landing crew!

70
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,570
And get emergency services!

71
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:42,505
There's someone down there!

72
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:45,608
It's gonna give!

73
00:03:56,587 --> 00:04:00,190
Private Delta 3-4-7,
you're clear for taxiway Foxtrot.

74
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:04,093
Private Delta 3-4-7,
clear for taxiway Foxtrot.

75
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:11,134
Regis Air 7-5-3, this
is Kennedy ground.

76
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:16,539
Regis Air 7-5-3, Kennedy ground.

77
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:20,143
Regis 7-5-3, Kennedy ground, over.

78
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:24,347
What the...?

79
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:27,717
Bishop...

80
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,586
a Regis Air flight out of Berlin,

81
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:31,020
the 767 widebody,

82
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,722
stopped on the service apron.

83
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:33,857
What's it doing there?

84
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:34,924
Apron's dead.

85
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:35,992
That's a blind spot.

86
00:04:35,993 --> 00:04:36,993
I don't know.

87
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:38,261
The plane just went dark,

88
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:39,629
shut down, flat-out quit.

89
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,231
No lights, no radio, no nothing.

90
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:43,132
Regis 7-5-3, Kennedy ground, over.

91
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:46,002
Regis 7-5-3- Kennedy
ground, please respond, over.

92
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,839
Okay, shut down Foxtrot.

93
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,908
Clear all the gates and advise reroute.

94
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:54,110
How many aboard?

95
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:55,879
Almost full flight, sir.

96
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,214
Passengers, crew, about 210 souls.

97
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,549
Holy Jesus.

98
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,851
Shouldn't we wait for
first responders, sir?

99
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:15,131
Bishop?

100
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,235
Bishop, wait!

101
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:22,372
Engines are shut down.

102
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:24,173
No lights.

103
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:31,414
Whoa, it's cold.

104
00:05:33,951 --> 00:05:37,453
It's like a dead animal.

105
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,457
There's something really wrong here.

106
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,728
It's like it never moved.

107
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,297
This looks so much bigger

108
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:49,132
from the ground than on the screen.

109
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,467
I mean, they're like buildings with wings.

110
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:56,573
All the window shades are shut, see that?

111
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:58,675
Bishop!

112
00:05:58,676 --> 00:06:00,443
Hey, fellas.

113
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:01,678
Bishop...

114
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,113
Not all of them...

115
00:06:13,524 --> 00:06:17,627
Scramble all emergency
vehicles to taxiway Foxtrot.

116
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,262
SWAT, Homeland Security?

117
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:21,631
Port Authority, FBI, TSA, CDC.

118
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,033
Robbie, no one on the tower calls home.

119
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:25,568
No one shares the news.

120
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:27,604
This is bad, real bad.

121
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:32,909
We've got ourselves a dead airplane.

124
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:12,690
Hey, buddy, you can't park there.
There's a fire hydrant.

125
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:13,991
It's a medical emergency.

126
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:15,425
Oh, is it really?

127
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:18,499
It will be if I can't
get this tie on right.

128
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,029
You know how to tie this?

129
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,064
I don't know, man, I wear a clip-on.

130
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:23,132
You're on your own.

131
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:24,333
You waiting for somebody?

132
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:25,434
Yeah, why?

133
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:26,903
Here's what I need you to do.

134
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,304
The meter maid comes by,

135
00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:30,506
you tell them it's
official CDC business, okay?

136
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:31,908
Yeah, sure thing.

137
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:35,077
Zach.

138
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:37,613
Hey, man.

139
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:44,987
Hey, dude.

140
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:46,155
You're late.

141
00:07:46,156 --> 00:07:47,790
Five minutes. It can't be helped.

142
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:48,891
Ten, Dad.

143
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:50,193
Ten? Okay.

144
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:51,194
That's wrong.

145
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:52,628
Maybe... maybe ten.

146
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:55,998
I got a good feeling about this.

147
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:57,533
Wish us luck.

148
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:01,070
Good luck.

149
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,311
Five minutes.

150
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:09,979
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

151
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,080
Ten.

152
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:13,482
I texted you five times.

153
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:14,851
I wouldn't have gotten that

154
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:16,419
'cause I don't text when I drive.

155
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,520
It's not safe.

156
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:18,754
Dr. Goodweather...

157
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:19,856
Eph, please.

158
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:21,390
She gets Kelly, my son gets Zach,

159
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:23,459
so Ephraim or Eph, please.

160
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,362
Dr. Goodweather, this is the last of six

161
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:28,531
court-appointed custody
counselling sessions.

162
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:30,132
You've been late for four of them.

163
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:33,202
Are you gonna say that I'm late
because I don't want to be here?

164
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:36,138
You might be onto something
but I have a really good reason.

165
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,974
There was this outbreak of Hantavirus

166
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,609
in this alphabet city pre-school.

167
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,911
Which is extremely rare
this far north and east.

168
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,813
Dr. Goodweather, every time you come in

169
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,348
you take over the session.

170
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:47,583
Because I have control issues, I know.

171
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:49,318
But I have to defend myself here.

172
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,821
Because this might be my last chance.

173
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:55,157
And I've thought long and hard about this.

174
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:57,994
And it seems like you two
have created this narrative

175
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,795
wherein I'm the bad guy.

176
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:00,997
But why?

177
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,766
Because I don't want out of my marriage.

178
00:09:05,202 --> 00:09:07,803
'Cause I want things
back the way they were.

179
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:10,706
But this isn't just about you, Eph,

180
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:12,808
what you want, not anymore.

181
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:26,489
I'm an epidemiologist.

182
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,593
You know, if I take time off,
if I go fly-fishing, people die.

183
00:09:30,594 --> 00:09:33,229
I get that you have an
important job, Ephraim.

184
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,231
And you're great at your job.

185
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:36,966
You get straight 'A's at your job.

186
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:39,468
But I'm flunking our marriage, is that it?

187
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:42,104
What are you writing? Please stop writing.

188
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:45,374
How horrible am I?

189
00:09:46,743 --> 00:09:48,277
You're not horrible.

190
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:51,314
You're just barely present.

191
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:55,284
I've done everything you've asked me to

192
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:58,154
in order to get us back together again.

193
00:09:58,155 --> 00:09:59,822
I quit drinking.

194
00:09:59,823 --> 00:10:01,791
You wanted time alone so I moved out,

195
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:02,925
against my own wishes.

196
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:04,493
I've jumped through every hoop.

197
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:05,828
Tell me what you need.

198
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:08,230
Our time apart has only
clarified things for me.

199
00:10:08,231 --> 00:10:10,700
It's allowed me to make
room in my life for Matt.

200
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:12,868
We're going to be living
together now and...

201
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:16,238
Matt, the Sears guy you were
talking about, at my house?

202
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:17,807
Matt is an operational manager.

203
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:19,008
At Sears.

204
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:20,276
Yeah, and you know what,

205
00:10:20,277 --> 00:10:22,178
he gets straight 'A's at his job, too.

206
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,612
But at home, he's present.

207
00:10:23,613 --> 00:10:26,482
Unlike you, he's always
here for both of us.

208
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:31,253
Does he drive a green Prius?

209
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:41,097
You want me to quit my job, I'll do it.

210
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,198
I'll quit my job.

211
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:43,699
I don't want you to quit for me.

212
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,167
I wouldn't be quitting for you.

213
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:47,136
I'd be quitting because of you for Zach,

214
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:48,804
so he isn't driving around Queens

215
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:50,039
in a green goddamn Prius.

216
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,307
Dr. Goodweather.

217
00:10:51,308 --> 00:10:52,975
It's too late, Eph.

218
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:54,710
I love you but...

219
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:57,446
How can you love me and it be too late?

220
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:59,949
You want a guy who's crazy about Zach?

221
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,983
Check.

222
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:03,819
A guy who's crazy about you?

223
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,254
Check.

224
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:07,323
Decent, employed.

225
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:09,625
Check, check.

226
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:24,640
Can't you see that this
is the problem, Eph?

227
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:28,644
This is who you are.

228
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:32,481
Go.

229
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,763
Nora, how bad is it?

230
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:49,098
It's crazy.

231
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:51,367
I have like 12 different agency officials

232
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:53,536
about to have a
dick-measuring contest here.

233
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:54,970
No.

234
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:57,440
It's an international
flight docking out of Berlin.

235
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:58,808
CDC gets the first call.

236
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:00,543
I can be there in 20 minutes.

237
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:02,978
Can you keep the measuring
contest going that long?

238
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:05,014
Don't worry, I'll show them mine.

239
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,849
It might just work.

240
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:11,487
Sorry.

241
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:15,091
I guess the meter reader didn't
see it as much of an emergency.

242
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,861
Matt, huh?

243
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:20,796
Yeah, that's me.

244
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:22,131
Interesting.

245
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:24,800
You know, it's too bad
I'm such a rush, Matt.

246
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:27,103
But I'm sure I'll see
you again in my house.

247
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,675
You drive safe now, you hear?

248
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:39,431
_

249
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:42,952
Hey, boss.

250
00:12:42,953 --> 00:12:44,153
Got my milk?

251
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:45,254
Uh, yeah, here.

252
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:47,456
Homeland Security is just desperate

253
00:12:47,457 --> 00:12:49,425
to push the button on a terror alert.

254
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:51,694
They're ready to get
on that plane right now.

255
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:53,462
Jim, terrorists usually crash planes,

256
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:55,064
not land them and shut them down.

257
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,665
So what are the 911 calls saying?

258
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,900
There haven't been any.

259
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:58,901
None?

260
00:12:58,902 --> 00:12:59,935
Uh uh.

261
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:01,036
Dr. Goodweather!

262
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:02,671
When we flew to Chicago last week

263
00:13:02,672 --> 00:13:04,507
we sat on the tarmac for half an hour.

264
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:06,575
People were freaking out, texting, calling.

265
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:09,178
There've been 200 people
sitting there silently for...

266
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,813
over an hour now.

267
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:11,847
Pilots?

268
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:13,048
Absolutely no movement.

269
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:14,583
Have you done heat readings?

270
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,152
Surface of the plane's too cold.

271
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:17,653
Blocks it all like a screen.

272
00:13:17,654 --> 00:13:18,954
We got Delsar mics attached

273
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:20,356
to the surface of the plane,

274
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:21,524
picked up mostly silence.

275
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:22,525
Mostly?

276
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:24,059
Well, cooling pings

277
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,394
from the sheet metal contracting.

278
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:27,062
Oh, and there's this.

279
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:40,009
What do you think that is?

280
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,410
Rustling of some sort.

281
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:43,712
Our experts think it's
the engine shutting down

282
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:44,813
or liquids settling.

283
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:46,682
How long between landing and shutdown?

284
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:48,083
Six minutes.

285
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:50,219
It's too short a window
for a contagious event.

286
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,955
So I think CDC should take
a back seat on this one.

287
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:54,223
I agree.

288
00:13:54,224 --> 00:13:55,391
Do you?

289
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:56,592
Absolutely, I do.

290
00:13:56,593 --> 00:13:58,427
How often do you touch your face?

291
00:13:58,428 --> 00:13:59,428
What?

292
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:00,663
In a day, how often?

293
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:02,598
I don't know, once an hour?

294
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:04,400
Every three minutes.

295
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:06,368
You have mouth/hand
contact every five minutes.

296
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:08,470
You touch somebody else every 20 minutes.

297
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:10,005
That's how contagion works.

298
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:11,273
You don't like terrorists?

299
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:12,708
Try negotiating with a virus.

300
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:16,378
A virus exists only to find
a carrier and reproduce.

301
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:18,814
That's all it does and it does it quickly.

302
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:20,416
It has no political views,

303
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:23,118
it has no religious beliefs,
it has no cultural hang-ups.

304
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:25,421
And it has no respect for a badge.

305
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:28,057
It has no concept of time or geography.

306
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:30,025
It might as well be the Middle Ages,

307
00:14:30,026 --> 00:14:32,228
except for the convenience
of hitching a ride

308
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:35,564
on a metal tube flying
from meal to meal to meal.

309
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:38,033
That's how a plague begins.

310
00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:42,471
So you still want to be the
first one through the door?

311
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:53,676
_

312
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,866
So we heard you buy silver
without a receipt, man.

313
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,134
Is that right?

314
00:15:17,173 --> 00:15:20,843
I'm always in need of good silver, yes.

315
00:15:20,844 --> 00:15:22,578
Okay, well...

316
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:25,814
Can I get, uh, 50 for this?

317
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:33,322
It's a very nice timepiece, indeed.

318
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:37,559
I see that the band links have snapped.

319
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,363
You must have been in
a hurry taking it off.

320
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:43,632
Can I... can I get 50 for it?

321
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:47,002
I can offer you maybe 25...

322
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:49,705
if the test is good.

323
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,479
Unfortunately, this is
merely silver-plated brass.

324
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,582
A cheap Eastern European knock-off.

325
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:02,918
Agh!

326
00:16:04,054 --> 00:16:05,120
Listen very carefully, son!

327
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:06,822
I know your little friend has a gun

328
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:08,991
and the hammer is cocked but I don't care.

329
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:12,394
I can control your entire body
weight from this pressure point

330
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:15,597
and this knife is pointing
straight at your radial artery.

331
00:16:15,598 --> 00:16:17,633
By the time he clears his coat pocket,

332
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:20,502
your artery will be
punctured and sliced wide open

333
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:21,537
from top to bottom.

334
00:16:22,772 --> 00:16:24,940
You fall down bleeding,
I go under the counter

335
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:27,376
and your friend starts
shooting at an empty space.

336
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:29,011
I can guarantee you this...

337
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:31,747
you will bleed out before the
911 operator answers the phone.

338
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:33,549
That is option one!

339
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,051
Option two is, you release the bills,

340
00:16:36,052 --> 00:16:38,120
your friend gives me the gun,

341
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:40,222
he can keep the bullets, I don't care,

342
00:16:40,223 --> 00:16:41,824
and you leave this store.

343
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:45,127
Now, son, you have a choice.

344
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:06,281
Is there anything else I can do
for you gentlemen this evening?

345
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:21,764
We have more
now on the developing story

346
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:23,766
out of JFK Airport tonight.

347
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:25,567
You're looking at live video

348
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:28,837
of the airplane identified
as a Regis Air widebody jet.

349
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:30,606
It originated in Berlin

350
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:32,708
and it shut down just
moments after landing.

351
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:35,577
We are told there has been no
communication from the pilot.

352
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:37,679
All attempts to contact the flight crew...

353
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,914
Berlin...

354
00:18:58,294 --> 00:18:59,628
He's back.

355
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:07,169
I, uh...

356
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:10,739
I don't know if I have the strength

357
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,407
to do it all over again.

358
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,918
This time...

359
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,520
I cannot fail.

360
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:35,030
Feeling hungry?

361
00:20:12,535 --> 00:20:13,835
Enjoy, dear.

362
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,748
_

363
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:40,700
I'm not looking forward to
what we'll see out there.

364
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:43,501
You with me?

365
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:47,638
Mysterious dead plane on the
tarmac not exciting enough?

366
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:51,208
Sorry, just another court-mandated,

367
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:54,211
happy family therapy day.

368
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,381
I noticed, you cut your hair.

369
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,116
You cleaned up nicely.

370
00:20:59,117 --> 00:21:00,518
Did you break out a tie?

371
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,186
It's in my jacket pocket.

372
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:04,708
Did it help?

373
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:06,610
Uh, no, in fact, it didn't.

374
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:09,179
She wants to take Zack away from me.

375
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,448
And there's a... man-child

376
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:13,817
living in my house with my son.

377
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:15,252
Careful.

378
00:21:18,723 --> 00:21:20,090
Stay focused.

379
00:21:23,528 --> 00:21:25,996
You and Kelly have been
separated for a year,

380
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:27,264
and things happen.

381
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:28,465
It happened to us.

382
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:29,766
Oh, that's different.

383
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:30,867
How is it different?

384
00:21:30,868 --> 00:21:31,902
It just is.

385
00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:33,403
I don't think Kelly would agree.

386
00:21:33,404 --> 00:21:35,439
She doesn't know. I never told her.

387
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,506
You didn't?

388
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:37,974
No, she...

389
00:21:37,975 --> 00:21:39,776
she filed so I didn't tell her.

390
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:41,311
She doesn't know.

391
00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:46,249
You really know nothing
about women, do you?

392
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:02,933
Okay, boss...

393
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:04,801
ready to go through the looking glass?

394
00:22:04,802 --> 00:22:06,436
Ready, Jim.

395
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:08,972
I got your milk.

396
00:22:10,141 --> 00:22:12,409
Keep it cold 'til I come back.

397
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:48,712
Oh my God...

398
00:22:49,914 --> 00:22:51,982
Jim, do you see this?

399
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:54,117
It's every passenger.
Everyone on the plane.

400
00:22:54,118 --> 00:22:55,752
Yeah.

401
00:22:55,753 --> 00:22:57,454
We're seeing it.

402
00:22:57,455 --> 00:22:59,456
They're all dead.

403
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:02,359
What is it, Eph? What killed them?

404
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,994
No signs of struggle.

405
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:07,564
No signs of blistering or chemical agents.

406
00:23:07,565 --> 00:23:08,999
No bruising.

407
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,839
Not seeing discoloration...

408
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,173
no markings.

409
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:19,809
Shit, what is it?

410
00:23:23,114 --> 00:23:24,881
Something sudden, painless.

411
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:33,156
All the window shades are
closed except for this one.

412
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:37,527
Is it a gas leak? Is it chemical?

413
00:23:37,528 --> 00:23:40,230
The Hazmat Cat's picking
up high levels of ammonia.

414
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:41,698
Nothing deadly, though.

415
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:44,234
There shouldn't be any
ammonia in the plane systems.

416
00:23:44,235 --> 00:23:45,769
Jim, check the cargo manifest.

417
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,903
Got it.

418
00:23:46,904 --> 00:23:48,471
I need a cargo manifest.

419
00:23:48,472 --> 00:23:49,673
What about the Geiger?

420
00:23:49,674 --> 00:23:51,374
It's negative, Jim.

421
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:14,431
No visible signs of trauma.

422
00:24:27,044 --> 00:24:28,378
No bloating.

423
00:24:30,881 --> 00:24:34,618
Tongue and soft palate
appear pale, almost white.

424
00:24:41,158 --> 00:24:42,659
Eyes are clear.

425
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:47,030
The skin is dry, it's inelastic.

426
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:49,532
There's no frothing or nosebleeds.

427
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:52,669
There's no signs of struggle.

428
00:24:53,771 --> 00:24:55,271
Almost peaceful.

429
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:01,211
Let's try the UV lights.

430
00:25:12,657 --> 00:25:14,691
My God, what is this?

431
00:25:18,763 --> 00:25:21,398
Are you getting this?

432
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:24,000
These patterns are everywhere.

433
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:25,902
All over the cabin.

434
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:28,371
They're only visible under UV light.

435
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:31,307
The pattern is biological.

436
00:25:33,811 --> 00:25:36,680
Probably where the ammonia is coming from.

437
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:39,516
I'm taking samples.

438
00:25:40,985 --> 00:25:44,187
You take the front
galley, I'll take the rear.

439
00:26:35,139 --> 00:26:36,506
Jimbo...

440
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:38,041
what is this?

441
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:42,412
No, "Jimbo, please"?

442
00:26:43,547 --> 00:26:46,049
Um, that's the cargo compartment.

443
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,450
Have it emptied.

444
00:26:47,451 --> 00:26:49,419
Take each piece of luggage

445
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,122
and check it for biological
agents and ammonia spectrum.

446
00:26:52,123 --> 00:26:53,389
Got it.

447
00:27:24,922 --> 00:27:25,889
Jim...

448
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,291
the cockpit door just opened.

449
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,628
It should be locked.

450
00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:34,731
Nora, that door's not supposed to be open.

451
00:27:34,732 --> 00:27:37,100
Just going to take a quick look.

452
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:40,069
Alright, I want you back
out of there right now, okay?

453
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,272
That door is supposed to be locked.

454
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:44,440
You shouldn't be in there alone.

455
00:27:46,277 --> 00:27:47,811
Nora, can you hear me?

456
00:27:47,812 --> 00:27:49,078
Eph!

457
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,647
The door to the cockpit is open.

458
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:52,048
Nora is inside.

459
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:59,422
Nora? Eph?

460
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:03,326
Come on, guys, somebody talk to me!

461
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:10,733
Nora, I'm coming!

462
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,537
Help me!

463
00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:17,106
Lady, get the light outta my face.

464
00:28:18,976 --> 00:28:20,476
I'm sending in SWAT!

465
00:28:20,477 --> 00:28:21,978
No, Jim, send paramedics!

466
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:23,780
We've got survivors!

467
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:33,664
_

468
00:28:55,257 --> 00:28:56,624
Mr. Palmer...

469
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:59,060
Shh! It's his dialysis session.

470
00:28:59,061 --> 00:29:00,928
He's asleep.

471
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:03,030
Well, then wake him up.

472
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:04,432
When he's ready.

473
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:05,666
Now.

474
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,168
In time.

475
00:29:08,603 --> 00:29:10,471
Dialysis complete.

476
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:14,008
How long have you worked for
Stoneheart, Mr. Fitzwilliam?

477
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:15,910
All my life, sir.

478
00:29:15,911 --> 00:29:18,512
Mr. Palmer aided me and my brothers

479
00:29:18,513 --> 00:29:20,414
after my father passed.

480
00:29:20,415 --> 00:29:24,218
Gratitude, what an effective leash.

481
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:28,289
Herr Eichhorst...

482
00:29:32,527 --> 00:29:38,165
Mr. Palmer, Herr Eichhorst
is here to pay his respects.

483
00:29:41,636 --> 00:29:43,471
I'll be outside if you need me.

484
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:50,077
You may notice how chilly it
has gotten in here, Eichhorst.

485
00:29:50,078 --> 00:29:52,980
Twenty full degrees cooler
than the rest of the building.

486
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:55,149
But not too cold for you, I trust.

487
00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:00,488
Of course, it can't be
too cold for you, can it?

488
00:30:00,489 --> 00:30:03,023
The cargo has arrived safely

489
00:30:03,024 --> 00:30:06,393
and all four survivors have been found.

490
00:30:07,796 --> 00:30:09,363
Throughout my life

491
00:30:09,364 --> 00:30:12,767
I've learned what it feels to cross a line,

492
00:30:12,768 --> 00:30:14,502
to do things.

493
00:30:14,503 --> 00:30:17,705
Things that cannot be undone.

494
00:30:20,742 --> 00:30:22,009
That line...

495
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:26,447
it has been crossed now, hasn't it?

496
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:29,717
Your breath...

497
00:30:29,718 --> 00:30:32,253
I'll never get used to...

498
00:30:33,922 --> 00:30:37,258
Yes, even I miss breathing sometimes.

499
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,731
Here we go.

500
00:30:48,804 --> 00:30:50,905
Leave it to me, it won't be long.

501
00:30:58,613 --> 00:30:59,547
Everett.

502
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:01,549
Eph.

503
00:31:02,851 --> 00:31:04,585
How bad is it?

504
00:31:07,856 --> 00:31:10,591
The NTSB has taken over a
refrigerated chemical warehouse

505
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,226
in the Bronx.

506
00:31:12,227 --> 00:31:15,162
They've turned it into a fully
contained mass casualty morgue.

507
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:16,664
That's not necessary, Everett.

508
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:18,098
These bags are triple-sealed.

509
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:20,167
I'm handing a dozen bodies over to the CME

510
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:22,002
four from each section of the plane

511
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:23,070
for autopsies.

512
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:24,538
And the four survivors?

513
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:27,007
I've secured the isolation
rooms at a local hospital.

514
00:31:27,008 --> 00:31:28,876
We need to move them there right away.

515
00:31:28,877 --> 00:31:30,744
Of course. I'm sure they'll comply.

516
00:31:30,745 --> 00:31:32,313
Comply? I'm not asking them.

517
00:31:32,314 --> 00:31:35,115
Invoking the Health Powers
Act, those four survivors stay.

518
00:31:35,116 --> 00:31:36,784
Quarantine?

519
00:31:36,785 --> 00:31:40,120
It's within the powers of the
CDC, Everett, you know that.

520
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:41,455
Look, if you quarantine

521
00:31:41,456 --> 00:31:43,490
I need you to meet with the next of kin.

522
00:31:43,491 --> 00:31:45,292
Reassure them the CDC's on the case.

523
00:31:45,293 --> 00:31:46,961
Fine.

524
00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:48,662
We're trying to figure out what happened,

525
00:31:48,663 --> 00:31:50,231
what caused this.

526
00:31:50,232 --> 00:31:52,700
Isn't that what's most important?
-Yes, of course.

527
00:31:52,701 --> 00:31:55,469
But it's also important we
don't have full-tilt panic.

528
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,005
These people need to hear
from someone in the field.

529
00:31:58,006 --> 00:31:59,406
We don't know anything yet.

530
00:31:59,407 --> 00:32:02,042
You two figure this out. I
don't have time for this shit.

531
00:32:02,043 --> 00:32:03,110
Jim?
-Yeah.

532
00:32:03,111 --> 00:32:04,545
When he talks to the families,

533
00:32:04,546 --> 00:32:06,380
I want no press, Everett.

534
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:08,482
No press, I promise.

535
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,099
Okay, you're telling me only four people

536
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,001
survived this plane crash?

537
00:32:27,002 --> 00:32:28,068
Ms. Luss...

538
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:29,436
It Mrs. Luss.

539
00:32:29,437 --> 00:32:31,138
Mrs. Luss, there was no crash.

540
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:32,673
An unidentified agent

541
00:32:32,674 --> 00:32:34,541
killed all of the remaining passengers.

542
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:37,177
Any information you can give
us would be of great help.

543
00:32:37,178 --> 00:32:38,545
Of great help to who?

544
00:32:38,546 --> 00:32:40,014
To us, ma'am, the CDC.

545
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:41,916
Okay, well, I'm no ordinary passenger.

546
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:43,284
I'm Joan Luss.

547
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:47,988
I'm an attorney... of
Matloff, Luss and Hayum.

548
00:32:47,989 --> 00:32:49,056
So all that information
that you're collecting

549
00:32:49,057 --> 00:32:50,858
you're going to need to get to me.

550
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:52,059
Personally...

551
00:32:53,528 --> 00:32:54,628
What are you doing?

552
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:56,797
Don't seal me in, I'm talking to you.

553
00:32:56,798 --> 00:32:59,300
Excuse me, little miss.
Don't you walk away from me.

554
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:00,434
I am Joan Luss.

555
00:33:02,037 --> 00:33:04,571
Captain Redfern, this is
my colleague, Dr. Martinez.

556
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:06,707
What happened on my plane?

557
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:08,642
That's what we came to ask you.

558
00:33:08,643 --> 00:33:11,545
Now, I want you to try to
recall, as best you can...

559
00:33:11,546 --> 00:33:14,381
fresh cut grass, garlic, green apple...

560
00:33:14,382 --> 00:33:16,550
do you remember smelling any of these odors

561
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:18,185
before you passed out?

562
00:33:18,186 --> 00:33:20,220
What? Grass? Apples?

563
00:33:20,221 --> 00:33:22,957
Mnemonic odors, the way
our brain reads chemicals.

564
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:26,360
Phosphine gas, colorless,
smells like garlic.

565
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:29,964
Or phosgene very toxic,
smells like freshly cut grass.

566
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:31,632
I remember landing the plane

567
00:33:31,633 --> 00:33:33,200
and turning onto the taxiway.

568
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:35,002
And then...

569
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:37,604
I don't remember anything else.

570
00:33:37,605 --> 00:33:39,873
Eph, can I get you for a sec?

571
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:42,142
Oh, thank God, you're here.

572
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:43,243
I was just telling him

573
00:33:43,244 --> 00:33:44,611
I have this noise in my head

574
00:33:44,612 --> 00:33:45,846
like a hum.

575
00:33:45,847 --> 00:33:48,082
Could you have someone
look at my ears again?

576
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,651
We'll have somebody perform
a full battery of tests.

577
00:33:50,652 --> 00:33:53,454
But for now you need to stay
inside this tent, Mr. Barbour.

578
00:33:53,455 --> 00:33:54,722
You don't understand.

579
00:33:54,723 --> 00:33:56,790
My wife is gonna panic
if I don't call soon.

580
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:57,958
I need to call home.

581
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:59,460
Hey, you.

582
00:34:00,762 --> 00:34:03,263
You're the guy I gotta talk to around here?

583
00:34:03,264 --> 00:34:04,898
Uh, yeah, I think so.

584
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:06,667
How about some Demerol, Doc, huh?

585
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:09,636
And what time's that
refreshment cart swing by, uh?

586
00:34:09,637 --> 00:34:12,473
Mr. Bolivar, what is the
last thing you can remember

587
00:34:12,474 --> 00:34:14,208
before landing?

588
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:15,642
I don't know, uh...

589
00:34:15,643 --> 00:34:17,845
flickering lights, maybe.

590
00:34:17,846 --> 00:34:19,680
I blackout sometimes.

591
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:20,914
Those cuts on your arm?

592
00:34:20,915 --> 00:34:22,716
Oh, these?

593
00:34:22,717 --> 00:34:24,284
Yeah, I cut.

594
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,321
For the fans.

595
00:34:27,322 --> 00:34:29,957
Tell me, these tattoos,
occult, satanic things

596
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:32,159
is this really part of your belief system?

597
00:34:34,963 --> 00:34:36,296
You're kidding, Doc?

598
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:39,066
My father's a Baptist minister.

599
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:40,768
I'm in it for the pussy.

600
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:42,236
Eph.

601
00:34:42,237 --> 00:34:44,605
There's something you have
to see in the cargo area,

602
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:45,672
right now.

603
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:46,874
Okay, let's go.

604
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,784
Who un-crated this thing?

605
00:34:56,785 --> 00:34:57,885
No one.

606
00:34:57,886 --> 00:34:59,553
This was how it came out.

607
00:34:59,554 --> 00:35:01,121
No straps, no containment wrap.

608
00:35:01,122 --> 00:35:02,156
Well, what is it?

609
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:03,724
What's inside of it?

610
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:04,892
No one's opened it yet.

611
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:06,860
But, what does it say in the manifest?

612
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:08,162
It's not on the manifest.

613
00:35:08,163 --> 00:35:11,398
You got golf clubs, kayaks, machine parts

614
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:13,801
40 generators, 10.000 condoms

615
00:35:13,802 --> 00:35:17,137
10 plasma TVs, but no box.

616
00:35:17,138 --> 00:35:19,173
Looks like a coffin, doesn't it?

617
00:35:19,174 --> 00:35:21,175
Coffin? It's nine feet tall.

618
00:35:21,176 --> 00:35:23,110
It's old.

619
00:35:25,013 --> 00:35:26,713
It's hand carved, it's not machined.

620
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:31,718
Hey, guys, over here.

621
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:45,165
Guys, look, we swabbed
it, we ran the Geiger,

622
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,501
we did samples of the air
and everything is fine.

623
00:35:47,502 --> 00:35:49,002
But the NTSB was crystal clear

624
00:35:49,003 --> 00:35:51,105
they didn't want us to touch anything.

625
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:52,406
Help me open it.

626
00:35:53,575 --> 00:35:54,475
Okay.

627
00:35:59,414 --> 00:36:00,380
Soil.

628
00:36:00,381 --> 00:36:04,118
Why would someone ship a box of soil?

629
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,787
What are the chances
of someone loading this

630
00:36:06,788 --> 00:36:08,755
unchecked and unlisted?

631
00:36:08,756 --> 00:36:11,358
Something this size in a
flight bound for the US?

632
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,526
Impossible.

633
00:36:12,527 --> 00:36:14,061
Not in today's world.

634
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:16,997
Jim, get samples from the top, mid, bottom

635
00:36:16,998 --> 00:36:18,332
plastic seal it.

636
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,566
No one goes near this,

637
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:22,002
not Customs, not Homeland Security, nobody.

638
00:36:26,174 --> 00:36:27,975
Eph, look.

639
00:36:27,976 --> 00:36:29,409
It's a latch.

640
00:36:30,845 --> 00:36:33,313
Why would anyone put a latch on the inside?

641
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:36,683
Call Berlin.

642
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:38,519
There's gotta be a record of this.

643
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,020
Somebody put this on the plane.

644
00:36:40,021 --> 00:36:41,522
We just have to find out who.

645
00:36:47,362 --> 00:36:49,596
A lot of
confusion here tonight

646
00:36:49,597 --> 00:36:51,832
at JFK International Airport, Nestor.

647
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:54,334
Officials with the Centers
for Disease Control...

648
00:36:54,335 --> 00:36:56,436
Any man who doesn't put your mom first

649
00:36:56,437 --> 00:36:58,539
is out-of-his-mind crazy. Right, Z?

650
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,574
... multiple casualties,

651
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:02,709
I repeat, multiple casualties

652
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:05,512
aboard the stalled airliner,
Regis Air flight 753.

653
00:37:05,513 --> 00:37:07,781
Tonight was a big step for you.

654
00:37:07,782 --> 00:37:09,249
Shh!

655
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,251
... what caused the fatalities.

656
00:37:11,252 --> 00:37:12,920
As you can see, behind me

657
00:37:12,921 --> 00:37:15,189
officials with the CDC are on the scene.

658
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,559
But whether this is any indication
of a biological contamination...

659
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,993
Terrorists, it has to be.

660
00:37:19,994 --> 00:37:21,628
What do you think, Z?

661
00:37:21,629 --> 00:37:24,298
Whatever it is, my Dad will handle it.

662
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:25,566
Good night.

663
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:27,434
Good night, sweetheart.

664
00:37:27,435 --> 00:37:30,003
... what
caused the fatalities...

665
00:37:31,387 --> 00:37:34,499
_

666
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:37,711
And I need the master list of passengers

667
00:37:37,712 --> 00:37:39,913
with their points of embarkation.

668
00:37:39,914 --> 00:37:42,249
Also every place where that plane landed.

669
00:37:42,456 --> 00:37:46,268
_

670
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:58,222
_

671
00:38:00,235 --> 00:38:02,102
Eph...

672
00:38:02,103 --> 00:38:04,204
the families are waiting.

673
00:38:09,477 --> 00:38:12,512
You know this is all about him
covering his own ass, right?

674
00:38:27,862 --> 00:38:31,031
Just talk to them like
you'd like to be talked to.

675
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:32,933
Tell them what you'd like to hear.

676
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:36,069
Whatever happens I'll be there.

677
00:38:46,814 --> 00:38:48,849
_

678
00:38:49,222 --> 00:38:51,545
_

679
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:53,988
_

680
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:55,828
_

681
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:57,701
_

682
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:01,157
_

683
00:39:14,642 --> 00:39:17,980
Hey, you hear that?

684
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:21,248
No. Sorry, nothing.

685
00:40:40,027 --> 00:40:41,495
What the...?

686
00:40:51,939 --> 00:40:52,939
Agghh!

687
00:41:42,137 --> 00:41:44,035
Gun hands won't work.

688
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:48,054
Knocking boys out every
day when I was locked up.

689
00:41:48,455 --> 00:41:51,824
Raised all the time like Mayweather.

690
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:55,494
When I go a pro

691
00:41:55,495 --> 00:41:57,930
and I get rich rich,
I'll let you wash my car.

692
00:41:57,931 --> 00:41:59,732
I'll let him be my driver.

693
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:01,133
Wooo!

694
00:42:01,134 --> 00:42:03,469
That was it, you gonna sleep for a week.

695
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,805
Greatest of all time,
baby, greatest of all time.

696
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:07,974
You are avoiding me, Gus.

697
00:42:07,975 --> 00:42:09,709
This guy...

698
00:42:10,878 --> 00:42:11,677
Just like that?

699
00:42:11,678 --> 00:42:13,479
Just appear out of nowhere?

700
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,049
Reminds me of my ex, huh?

701
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,686
Now I'm gonna tell you like I told her,

702
00:42:20,687 --> 00:42:22,622
how you find me, bitch?

703
00:42:27,194 --> 00:42:30,196
I'll catch up to you in a little bit, man.

704
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:31,931
We good.

705
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:34,800
Wassup?

706
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,970
As we agreed

707
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:40,606
you will pick up the
vehicle at the airport.

708
00:42:40,607 --> 00:42:41,974
The airport?

709
00:42:41,975 --> 00:42:43,376
The whole place is on lock.

710
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:45,411
You don't watch the news, white boy?

711
00:42:45,412 --> 00:42:47,813
You will enter through a service staircase

712
00:42:47,814 --> 00:42:49,048
get the vehicle.

713
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:50,850
When you get to a barricade

714
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:52,852
you will be let through.

715
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:55,021
It's all arranged.

716
00:42:58,091 --> 00:42:59,558
It's all arranged?

717
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:01,994
Calm down, double oh seven.

718
00:43:01,995 --> 00:43:03,629
I never let you down before.

719
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,164
This is different.

720
00:43:08,902 --> 00:43:10,703
I need to make sure

721
00:43:10,704 --> 00:43:13,472
you follow my instructions precisely.

722
00:43:13,473 --> 00:43:15,675
Your brother's criminal record

723
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:19,078
and your mother's immigration status.

724
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,381
If this is a threat

725
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:25,017
you just made a mistake, puto.

726
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:29,121
It is not a threat. It is more a reward.

727
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,558
The rest of your fee is in the glove box.

728
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:34,660
Destination is pre-programmed

729
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:36,862
on the GPS in the vehicle.

730
00:43:39,733 --> 00:43:42,234
I get picked up driving a
stolen van, that's it, bro.

731
00:43:42,235 --> 00:43:44,837
They gonna send me back to the bull pen.

732
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:47,373
I can't go back.

733
00:43:48,475 --> 00:43:49,842
Can't do it, man.

734
00:43:53,613 --> 00:43:55,548
It is not stolen.

735
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:58,117
You will be let through

736
00:43:58,118 --> 00:43:59,819
and at the end of it

737
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,556
your mother's immigration
status will be fixed.

738
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:07,360
Your brother's criminal record erased.

739
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,933
I do this for you, that's it, I'm done.

740
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:15,534
Lose my number and my address.

741
00:44:15,535 --> 00:44:18,037
I'm trying to do the right
thing by my mother now.

742
00:44:18,038 --> 00:44:19,905
'Cause if anything happens to her

743
00:44:19,906 --> 00:44:22,918
I mean, anything...

744
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,499
I'll kill your waxy ass.

745
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,283
Three rules...

746
00:44:29,596 --> 00:44:31,964
you will not examine the cargo.

747
00:44:31,965 --> 00:44:34,300
You will not make any stops.

748
00:44:34,301 --> 00:44:36,736
And you will cross the bridge

749
00:44:36,737 --> 00:44:40,172
back into Manhattan before daybreak.

750
00:44:40,173 --> 00:44:42,007
Do you understand?

751
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,479
In English then, the three rules.

752
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,317
Screw you.

753
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:54,053
Suck my dick.

754
00:44:55,555 --> 00:44:57,323
I'll get it done.

755
00:45:15,675 --> 00:45:17,427
_

756
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,585
urgent chatter)

757
00:45:29,656 --> 00:45:34,426
My
daughter was on that flight!

758
00:45:35,962 --> 00:45:39,165
Bolivar! Bolivar! Bolivar!

759
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:48,808
Sir, this area of the airport is closed.

760
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:51,076
You have to wait back
there with everybody else.

761
00:45:51,077 --> 00:45:52,678
Hey, settle down, will ya!

762
00:45:54,548 --> 00:45:56,549
Bolivar! Bolivar! Bolivar!

763
00:46:22,175 --> 00:46:24,677
Hey, sir! Sir!

764
00:46:27,214 --> 00:46:28,280
Sir!

765
00:46:29,616 --> 00:46:31,717
It's alright, sorry,
just go get a wheelchair.

766
00:46:31,718 --> 00:46:33,118
He's a medical.

767
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,286
You all right?

768
00:46:34,287 --> 00:46:35,754
Sir, what do you have here?

769
00:46:35,755 --> 00:46:37,223
You have... Coumadin.

770
00:46:37,224 --> 00:46:38,891
You got a heart condition?

771
00:46:38,892 --> 00:46:40,626
Are you all right?

772
00:46:42,963 --> 00:46:44,296
Are you in charge?

773
00:46:44,297 --> 00:46:45,631
What?

774
00:46:45,632 --> 00:46:49,001
I need to talk to someone about that plane.

775
00:46:53,139 --> 00:46:55,541
I recognize some of these
names in First Class.

776
00:46:57,143 --> 00:46:58,344
That never helps.

777
00:47:00,747 --> 00:47:04,116
Look, Eph, just introduce yourself

778
00:47:04,117 --> 00:47:06,218
and tell them we're on it.

779
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:07,820
You'll do great.

780
00:47:09,022 --> 00:47:10,055
Go on.

781
00:47:23,803 --> 00:47:26,906
When you said no press,
I almost believed you.

782
00:47:36,816 --> 00:47:38,684
I'm Ephraim Goodweather.

783
00:47:38,685 --> 00:47:40,319
I'm the Chief Medical Officer

784
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,155
for the Centers for Disease
Control here in New York.

785
00:47:43,156 --> 00:47:45,124
I have been asked to introduce myself

786
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:47,126
and to give you a preliminary update on...

787
00:47:47,127 --> 00:47:48,661
How many survivors?

788
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:52,765
Please...

789
00:47:54,868 --> 00:47:56,568
Please, please, please...

790
00:48:03,076 --> 00:48:06,211
I think I'm supposed to stand
here and somehow reassure you.

791
00:48:07,914 --> 00:48:09,281
I can't do that.

792
00:48:12,786 --> 00:48:14,787
Two hundred and six passengers

793
00:48:14,788 --> 00:48:17,456
on Regis Air flight 753 are dead.

794
00:48:17,457 --> 00:48:19,058
And we don't know why.

795
00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:23,262
Four passengers survived,
and we don't know why.

796
00:48:23,263 --> 00:48:24,830
What I can tell you

797
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,799
having been the first to board the plane

798
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,301
is that they all appeared
to have died peacefully

799
00:48:29,302 --> 00:48:30,836
without distress.

800
00:48:30,837 --> 00:48:33,572
That's the only comfort I
can give you at this time.

801
00:48:35,308 --> 00:48:36,775
You want answers

802
00:48:36,776 --> 00:48:39,378
real answers to what happened
on that plane and so do I.

803
00:48:39,379 --> 00:48:41,680
And I won't quite until
we're all satisfied.

804
00:48:43,249 --> 00:48:44,883
I don't care about your promises!

805
00:48:44,884 --> 00:48:46,719
I want my daughter back!

806
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,722
All you do is talk and
talk! That's all you do!

807
00:48:53,226 --> 00:48:54,860
This is my daughter.

808
00:48:54,861 --> 00:48:56,662
My daughter, Emma!

809
00:48:56,663 --> 00:48:59,832
And I want to see her again, dead, alive.

810
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:01,934
I'm her father!

811
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,237
Don't you have children of your own?

812
00:49:05,238 --> 00:49:07,673
Don't you have a heart?

813
00:49:16,149 --> 00:49:18,050
Forty-eight hours, I'll get your answers.

814
00:49:18,051 --> 00:49:19,451
It's the best I can do.

815
00:49:19,452 --> 00:49:20,519
No!

816
00:49:24,758 --> 00:49:27,126
Jesus! Goodweather, what
are you doing to me here?

817
00:49:27,127 --> 00:49:28,660
Just tell me what you have.

818
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:30,162
I'm just getting into it now.

819
00:49:30,163 --> 00:49:32,197
I haven't finished cutting all of them yet.

820
00:49:32,198 --> 00:49:33,932
Just give me anything you can.

821
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:36,535
Okay, top of the charts...

822
00:49:36,536 --> 00:49:37,836
is here.

823
00:49:40,807 --> 00:49:42,808
Can you see this here?

824
00:49:44,144 --> 00:49:45,744
Yeah, what is that?

825
00:49:47,147 --> 00:49:48,380
It's an incision.

826
00:49:48,381 --> 00:49:51,150
Deep enough to puncture one
wall of the carotid artery

827
00:49:51,151 --> 00:49:53,052
without rupturing it.

828
00:49:53,053 --> 00:49:56,422
Razor sharp, clean cut,
no bruising, no trauma.

829
00:49:56,423 --> 00:49:58,257
There's no instrument that can do that.

830
00:49:58,258 --> 00:50:01,226
Not that I'm aware of, anyway,
not with this precision.

831
00:50:01,227 --> 00:50:02,327
Anything else?

832
00:50:02,328 --> 00:50:03,762
Gets way more interesting.

833
00:50:03,763 --> 00:50:07,166
A spot check of six other
corpses revealed the same thing.

834
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:10,335
The exact same wound,
in the exact same place.

835
00:50:10,336 --> 00:50:11,837
Are you telling me

836
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:14,373
that the other passengers
have the same incision?

837
00:50:14,374 --> 00:50:15,574
Or puncture.

838
00:50:15,575 --> 00:50:17,943
Yes, all the ones I've looked at so far.

839
00:50:17,944 --> 00:50:20,979
There is one more intriguing abnormality.

840
00:50:34,394 --> 00:50:36,495
I don't... what
the hell am I looking at?

841
00:50:36,496 --> 00:50:38,564
On our screen that looks white.

842
00:50:38,565 --> 00:50:40,599
Because it is white and opalescent.

843
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,534
Blood proteins are separating.

844
00:50:42,535 --> 00:50:45,304
No, in fact, there's a
complete absence of hypostasis.

845
00:50:45,305 --> 00:50:47,072
No blood pooling anywhere.

846
00:50:47,073 --> 00:50:49,074
And an absolute absence of erythrocytes.

847
00:50:49,075 --> 00:50:52,077
I'll know more once I cut into
the liver and kidneys but...

848
00:50:52,078 --> 00:50:53,512
I'm sorry to do this to you

849
00:50:53,513 --> 00:50:56,014
but you're gonna have to
do the preliminary alone.

850
00:50:56,015 --> 00:50:58,317
I don't want any of this
leaking to the press.

851
00:50:58,318 --> 00:50:59,918
Okay, buddy, but you'll owe me.

852
00:50:59,919 --> 00:51:01,787
For the rest of my life.

853
00:51:01,788 --> 00:51:03,088
Shit.

854
00:51:05,692 --> 00:51:07,192
Eph! I'm sorry but I think

855
00:51:07,193 --> 00:51:09,595
you're gonna want to talk to this man.

856
00:51:13,366 --> 00:51:15,667
Dr. Goodweather, my name
is Abraham Setrakian.

857
00:51:15,668 --> 00:51:17,035
It's very nice to meet you.

858
00:51:17,036 --> 00:51:18,570
I can't talk right now.

859
00:51:18,571 --> 00:51:21,240
Eph, he says he has some
insight into the outbreak here.

860
00:51:21,241 --> 00:51:22,908
Great.

861
00:51:22,909 --> 00:51:25,677
Mr. Kent, here, can take
down your information...

862
00:51:25,678 --> 00:51:27,146
Time is of the essence, Doctor.

863
00:51:27,147 --> 00:51:28,347
It certainly is. Jim...

864
00:51:28,348 --> 00:51:29,448
Eph...

865
00:51:29,449 --> 00:51:31,083
You have to listen to me.

866
00:51:31,084 --> 00:51:33,552
I have seen this disease before.

867
00:51:33,553 --> 00:51:35,220
I have faced it before.

868
00:51:35,221 --> 00:51:36,688
You... you must contain it.

869
00:51:36,689 --> 00:51:38,190
You've seen it before?

870
00:51:38,191 --> 00:51:40,626
I assure you we're taking
every available precaution.

871
00:51:40,627 --> 00:51:41,960
You're not. You can't.

872
00:51:41,961 --> 00:51:44,429
And he is counting on that.

873
00:51:45,832 --> 00:51:46,865
"He?"

874
00:51:46,866 --> 00:51:50,035
It is too much to say all at once here

875
00:51:50,036 --> 00:51:52,971
without sounding crazy.

876
00:51:54,507 --> 00:51:55,407
No, of course not.

877
00:51:55,408 --> 00:51:57,176
Uh, Jim, we're going to the cargo hold

878
00:51:57,177 --> 00:51:59,278
please take care of this gentleman for me.

879
00:51:59,279 --> 00:52:00,279
Thank you.

880
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,680
It's okay.

881
00:52:01,681 --> 00:52:03,015
Just come with me.

882
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,217
The bodies!

883
00:52:05,218 --> 00:52:07,586
They're not decomposing normally, yes?!

884
00:52:07,587 --> 00:52:09,421
The tissues are still pliable.

885
00:52:09,422 --> 00:52:11,490
How do you know that?
-Nora, Nora...

886
00:52:11,491 --> 00:52:12,991
Listen to me now.

887
00:52:12,992 --> 00:52:15,794
What I am about to say
I do not say lightly.

888
00:52:15,795 --> 00:52:17,863
All the passengers on that plane

889
00:52:17,864 --> 00:52:19,698
dead and alive...

890
00:52:21,534 --> 00:52:24,102
they must be destroyed.

891
00:52:25,672 --> 00:52:26,939
Destroyed? Okay.

892
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,006
Here you go, fellas.

893
00:52:28,007 --> 00:52:29,274
Feel better.

894
00:52:29,275 --> 00:52:31,043
The heads must be severed!

895
00:52:31,044 --> 00:52:33,812
The bodies burned, destroyed!

896
00:52:37,217 --> 00:52:39,251
Doctor, did you find the coffin?

897
00:52:39,252 --> 00:52:42,154
If you have the coffin
then you still have him!

898
00:52:42,155 --> 00:52:43,755
It is not too late!

899
00:52:43,756 --> 00:52:45,324
Destroy the coffin!

900
00:52:45,325 --> 00:52:47,960
Do not allow it across the river!

901
00:52:52,526 --> 00:52:56,342
_

902
00:52:57,086 --> 00:52:59,406
As advised by Doctor Goodweather

903
00:52:59,441 --> 00:53:02,501
I will examine the doby under UV light.

904
00:53:29,413 --> 00:53:32,181
How did that old
man know about the coffin?

905
00:53:32,182 --> 00:53:33,883
You mean the cabinet?

906
00:53:33,884 --> 00:53:35,685
He called it a coffin.

907
00:53:35,686 --> 00:53:37,286
I know what he called it.

908
00:53:37,287 --> 00:53:40,623
He also told us to destroy 206 bodies.

909
00:53:40,624 --> 00:53:42,358
And he had a sword.

910
00:53:44,962 --> 00:53:46,128
Nora.

911
00:53:51,134 --> 00:53:52,235
What?

912
00:53:53,437 --> 00:53:54,871
What the hell is that?

913
00:54:01,311 --> 00:54:03,045
Looks like a horsehair worm

914
00:54:03,046 --> 00:54:05,648
or a Dirofilaria immitis.

915
00:54:07,284 --> 00:54:09,151
Body is simple. It's just collagen.

916
00:54:09,152 --> 00:54:12,154
Degenerate non-functional
digestive system.

917
00:54:15,492 --> 00:54:16,692
Look at that.

918
00:54:16,693 --> 00:54:18,261
It's beautiful.

919
00:54:18,262 --> 00:54:21,464
It's looking for a host, it's desperate.

920
00:54:33,777 --> 00:54:36,679
So it's not airborne.

921
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:39,515
That's the carrier.

922
00:54:46,924 --> 00:54:47,823
Eph, look.

923
00:54:59,636 --> 00:55:00,836
Soil.

924
00:55:18,322 --> 00:55:19,355
Hey!

925
00:55:19,356 --> 00:55:21,190
Where's that cabinet?

926
00:55:21,191 --> 00:55:22,291
What cabinet?

927
00:55:30,734 --> 00:55:32,101
There, right there.

928
00:55:32,102 --> 00:55:33,502
Rewind.

929
00:55:33,503 --> 00:55:35,504
Can you go slower, frame by frame?

930
00:55:35,505 --> 00:55:37,573
There must be a gap or a cut.

931
00:55:37,574 --> 00:55:39,075
No, there's not cut.

932
00:55:39,076 --> 00:55:41,010
Watch the time code.

933
00:55:44,014 --> 00:55:45,548
Two seconds. Go back.

934
00:55:47,618 --> 00:55:48,818
Start there.

935
00:55:48,819 --> 00:55:50,219
Wait, wait.

936
00:55:51,321 --> 00:55:52,355
There.

937
00:55:55,459 --> 00:55:57,159
What's that distortion?

938
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,195
I don't know.

939
00:55:59,196 --> 00:56:02,932
It grabs the box and lifts it off...

940
00:56:02,933 --> 00:56:05,301
up...

941
00:56:06,503 --> 00:56:07,503
That box was 500 pounds.

942
00:56:07,504 --> 00:56:09,305
Nothing could lift it up like that.

943
00:56:09,306 --> 00:56:12,775
The old man said, "If you have
the coffin, you still have him."

944
00:56:14,177 --> 00:56:15,177
Him.

945
00:56:18,782 --> 00:56:22,084
This footage is only seven minutes old.

946
00:56:22,085 --> 00:56:25,421
The box is still in the airport.

947
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:37,273
_

948
00:56:58,288 --> 00:56:59,622
Uh huh.

949
00:57:11,334 --> 00:57:13,402
What the hell is that?

950
00:57:14,571 --> 00:57:16,172
Crazy ass white boy.

951
00:57:27,818 --> 00:57:29,585
Come on, come on, pick up.

952
00:57:29,586 --> 00:57:31,020
Jim, where are you right now?

953
00:57:31,021 --> 00:57:33,289
At the main garage door
funnelling traffic out.

954
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:34,890
Stop it, stop it! Stop everyone.

955
00:57:34,891 --> 00:57:36,258
This is an emergency.

956
00:57:36,259 --> 00:57:38,761
You need to seal off the
perimeter of the airport.

957
00:57:38,762 --> 00:57:40,162
That box...

958
00:57:40,163 --> 00:57:42,198
Remember the box with the markings on it?

959
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:43,999
Yeah, yeah, the Berlin cargo omit.

960
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,067
That's the one.

961
00:57:45,068 --> 00:57:46,435
Now listen carefully, Jim.

962
00:57:46,436 --> 00:57:49,705
We need to stop all vehicles
big enough to hold it.

963
00:57:49,706 --> 00:57:52,308
No vans, no trucks, nothing.

964
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:54,810
No big vehicles. No exceptions.

965
00:57:54,811 --> 00:57:57,913
Okay, no big vehicles in or out
of the security zone. Got it.

966
00:57:57,914 --> 00:57:59,648
Right, everybody listen up.

967
00:57:59,649 --> 00:58:01,550
I want none of these trucks

968
00:58:01,551 --> 00:58:04,787
big-sized vehicles released
without my authorization.

969
00:58:08,258 --> 00:58:09,391
C'mon...

970
00:58:09,392 --> 00:58:11,427
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

971
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:29,945
Pull up there, sir, I'll be right with you.

972
00:58:29,946 --> 00:58:32,114
Shit! Shit, shit!

973
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:43,359
ID and permit.

974
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,127
Oh, yeah, man.

975
00:58:45,128 --> 00:58:47,496
Crazy what's happening, huh?

976
00:58:56,973 --> 00:58:58,908
What do you want me to do with this?

977
00:59:05,482 --> 00:59:07,750
Step out of the vehicle,
open the cargo area, sir.

978
00:59:08,919 --> 00:59:10,286
Step out of the vehicle...

979
00:59:10,287 --> 00:59:12,267
Get the light out of my face!
-Step out of the vehicle.

980
00:59:12,268 --> 00:59:13,528
Can I get my seatbelt?

981
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,900
Hey. What's going on here?

982
00:59:27,598 --> 00:59:29,999
I asked for ID, he gave me this.

983
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,808
Oh, well, this is one of our vehicles.

984
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:40,222
You can let him through.
-Sir?

985
00:59:40,223 --> 00:59:41,517
I said, let him through.

986
00:59:46,538 --> 00:59:48,306
You tell those sons of bitches I'm done.

987
00:59:48,307 --> 00:59:50,575
I came through for them but now I am done.

988
00:59:50,576 --> 00:59:52,076
You got it?

989
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,083
Okay, go.

990
01:00:06,158 --> 01:00:10,828
I have now removed the
chest plate of one of the subjects

991
01:00:11,997 --> 01:00:13,831
and found...

992
01:00:13,832 --> 01:00:19,337
abnormal neoplasms in the heart, liver...

993
01:00:22,074 --> 01:00:23,741
and kidneys.

994
01:00:26,512 --> 01:00:30,548
The growths do not seem
like oncological aberrations

995
01:00:30,549 --> 01:00:37,422
but almost like new,
fully functional organs.

996
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,025
What?!

997
01:01:48,227 --> 01:01:49,260
No!

998
01:01:50,496 --> 01:01:51,462
Ah!

999
01:02:04,376 --> 01:02:05,510
Agh!

1000
01:02:47,676 --> 01:02:50,438
Sorry, Eph. Nothing.

1001
01:02:50,746 --> 01:02:51,779
You got anything here?

1002
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:53,915
Just trying to figure out

1003
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:57,781
how a 500-pound, 9-foot tall
coffin got up and walked away.

1004
01:02:59,419 --> 01:03:01,220
You called it a coffin.

1005
01:03:01,221 --> 01:03:02,588
We'll get a break.

1006
01:03:02,589 --> 01:03:03,756
We always do.

1007
01:03:03,757 --> 01:03:05,758
We just gotta find some place to start.

1008
01:03:09,496 --> 01:03:11,397
This is where we start.

1009
01:03:11,398 --> 01:03:13,099
What the hell are those?

1010
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:14,734
Something new.

1011
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,416
S-E-T-R-A-K-I-A-N?

1012
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:29,606
Setrakian?

1013
01:03:29,607 --> 01:03:31,119
What is... what is that?

1014
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,354
Armenian.

1015
01:03:32,355 --> 01:03:33,855
Is that where you're from?

1016
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:35,323
At one time...

1017
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,327
How soon may I leave?

1018
01:03:39,328 --> 01:03:41,129
Well, nothing happens 'til Monday.

1019
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:42,597
The charges are filed then.

1020
01:03:42,598 --> 01:03:44,166
It's almost dawn now.

1021
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:49,927
_

1022
01:03:53,409 --> 01:03:54,976
Are you the librarian?

1023
01:03:56,779 --> 01:03:58,013
Oh...

1024
01:03:58,014 --> 01:04:01,249
That's some ancient ink
you got there, old man.

1025
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:03,118
What is it, numbers?

1026
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,653
Yeah, numbers.

1027
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,156
Mean anything?

1028
01:04:10,827 --> 01:04:12,360
Only to me.

1029
01:04:21,804 --> 01:04:24,005
Everything went as planned.

1030
01:04:26,476 --> 01:04:29,244
Love is going
to guide them all back

1031
01:04:29,245 --> 01:04:32,581
to their homes, to their loved ones.

1032
01:04:37,019 --> 01:04:38,320
Curious detail...

1033
01:04:38,321 --> 01:04:43,492
an old man with a sword
was arrested at the airport.

1034
01:04:46,295 --> 01:04:47,629
The Jew.

1035
01:04:49,031 --> 01:04:50,365
He's still at it.

1036
01:04:50,366 --> 01:04:52,667
After all these years.

1037
01:04:52,668 --> 01:04:54,269
You must admire him for that.

1038
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:56,438
I'll take care of him.

1039
01:04:58,274 --> 01:05:00,108
I look out upon this island

1040
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:03,478
and I savour what is to come...

1041
01:05:04,947 --> 01:05:06,314
purity.

1042
01:05:07,483 --> 01:05:10,552
Mr. Fitzwilliam...

1043
01:05:10,553 --> 01:05:12,254
a sentimental man

1044
01:05:12,255 --> 01:05:14,289
would venture out into the city tonight

1045
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:17,159
to walk these streets one last time...

1046
01:05:19,095 --> 01:05:21,096
before the fall.

1047
01:05:22,632 --> 01:05:24,166
Do you require anything else, sir?

1048
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:25,767
No.

1049
01:05:25,768 --> 01:05:27,636
For the first time in my life

1050
01:05:27,637 --> 01:05:30,405
I have everything I need.

1051
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:03,104
Hello?

1052
01:06:03,105 --> 01:06:04,396
_

1053
01:06:04,431 --> 01:06:05,587
_

1054
01:06:05,588 --> 01:06:07,225
_

1055
01:06:07,226 --> 01:06:08,414
_

1056
01:06:08,415 --> 01:06:10,230
Huh? No, mommy, no.

1057
01:06:10,231 --> 01:06:11,313
I'm not smoking. You kidding me or what?

1058
01:06:11,314 --> 01:06:13,114
I'm working.

1059
01:06:13,115 --> 01:06:15,116
Just called to check in
to see what you're up to.

1060
01:06:15,117 --> 01:06:16,384
Is Crispin home?

1061
01:06:16,385 --> 01:06:17,419
He is.

1062
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,088
_

1063
01:06:21,004 --> 01:06:22,738
Mama, one beer left.

1064
01:06:22,739 --> 01:06:23,940
Why do you do this to me?

1065
01:06:23,941 --> 01:06:25,608
How many times do I gotta tell you?

1066
01:06:25,609 --> 01:06:26,976
I'm making his breakfast.

1067
01:06:26,977 --> 01:06:28,678
I'm getting on the bridge now.

1068
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:29,620
I'll be home in an hour.

1069
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:31,473
_

1070
01:06:31,474 --> 01:06:34,360
_

1071
01:06:37,534 --> 01:06:40,269
I don't know what you are but
you're bringing me good luck.

1072
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:57,320
Love, you see, is the
one force that cannot be explained

1073
01:06:58,497 --> 01:07:02,066
cannot be broken down
into a chemical process.

1074
01:07:02,067 --> 01:07:05,837
It is the beacon that guides us back home

1075
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:07,805
when no one is there

1076
01:07:07,806 --> 01:07:12,577
and the light that illuminates our loss.

1077
01:07:12,578 --> 01:07:16,314
Its absence robs us of all pleasure

1078
01:07:16,315 --> 01:07:19,450
of our capacity for joy.

1079
01:07:19,451 --> 01:07:24,922
It makes our nights darker
and our days gloomier.

1080
01:07:33,932 --> 01:07:35,566
But when we find love

1081
01:07:35,567 --> 01:07:40,271
no matter how wrong,
how sad or how terrible

1082
01:07:40,272 --> 01:07:41,939
we cling to it.

1083
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:44,208
It gives us our strength.

1084
01:07:44,209 --> 01:07:47,044
It holds us upright.

1085
01:07:48,643 --> 01:07:52,815
It feeds on us and we feed on it.

1086
01:08:11,865 --> 01:08:15,501
_

1087
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:29,957
Emma... Emma...

1088
01:08:45,733 --> 01:08:48,234
_

1089
01:08:54,354 --> 01:08:58,325
_

1090
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:08,084
_

1091
01:09:12,529 --> 01:09:13,887
Emma...

1092
01:09:13,888 --> 01:09:17,244
Oh, baby...

1093
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:26,708
_

1094
01:09:27,416 --> 01:09:29,524
_

1095
01:09:33,533 --> 01:09:36,430
Love is our grace.

1096
01:09:38,861 --> 01:09:41,926
Love is our downfall.

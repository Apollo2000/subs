00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,149
Previously on The Strain...

2
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:04,379
Regis 753 Kennedy ground
please respond, over.

3
00:00:04,436 --> 00:00:06,638
- Oh my God.
- They're all dead.

4
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:10,346
We've got survivors.

5
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:12,618
206 passengers are dead
and we don't know why.

6
00:00:13,832 --> 00:00:16,935
Four passengers survived
and we don't know why.

7
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:19,871
These Regis Air documents
point to a systems failure

8
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:24,208
aboard flight 753. It's
not a CDC case anymore.

9
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:26,511
- There's that hum again.
- It's almost like an echo.

10
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,447
Doctor did you find the
coffin? It is not too late!

11
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:31,749
Do not allow it across the river!

12
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:33,751
Where is your master now?

13
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:38,056
- What's your use for me?
- I want you to watch it unfold.

14
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:41,159
Unable to do anything to stop it.

15
00:00:41,226 --> 00:00:43,127
I wanted to talk about
custody hearing tomorrow.

16
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:45,163
Mom says I should just say how I feel.

17
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,165
And that I want joint custody.

18
00:00:47,232 --> 00:00:49,734
This is Gary Arnot. Thank you for sending

19
00:00:49,802 --> 00:00:51,636
- my little girl home to me.
- Are you saying someone

20
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:54,505
- released her body to you?
- No, not her body.

21
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:56,774
Emma's alive, she showed up
on my doorstep this morning.

26
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:25,595
- I know...
- You know what?

27
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:27,563
- Where did they take the bodies?
- All 206 casualties are gone

28
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:31,300
and the medical examiner,
so far as I can tell.

29
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:33,302
Well what do you think?
Was it the government...?

30
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,605
We are the government,
Jim. We can barely tie

31
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:37,640
our own shoes sometimes.
My money is on the military.

32
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,575
Why would they take the bodies?

33
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:41,611
'Cause they don't want them autopsied.

34
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:43,179
Is there more that you know, Everett?

35
00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:46,282
No, and I don't want to know, really.

36
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,118
The story that they all died
from an air floatation problem?

37
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,287
Carbon monoxide poisoning?
We saw those bodies.

38
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:54,090
- There were no signs of that.
- It's ludicrous. Contemptuous.

39
00:03:54,157 --> 00:03:56,058
So be it, as long as
it's not our diagnosis.

40
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:58,094
We have a responsibility, Everett.

41
00:03:58,161 --> 00:04:00,029
If I remember correctly,
Ephraim, you no longer have any

42
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:02,398
responsibility here,
whatsoever. You make sure

43
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:05,101
- the press gets nothing.
- OK.

44
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:07,182
- Radio silence from us.
- So what do we do now?

45
00:04:07,182 --> 00:04:10,151
We do nothing. This is no
longer about disease control,

46
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:12,531
this is about damage control.
And as of this moment,

47
00:04:12,554 --> 00:04:15,892
the CDC is an interested
observer, nothing more.

48
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:19,128
Which I will be sure to stress
to the Secretary of Health

49
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:21,997
and Human Services over breakfast...

50
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,500
Why would the military leave
four surviving passengers?

51
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:37,658
Jesus. Jesus, what did I do?

52
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:43,131
You've reached Greg Nelson

53
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:44,406
- leave me a message
- Hey, it's Jim Kent.

54
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,720
We need to talk.

55
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,731
Gertie!

56
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:29,161
Ansel...

57
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,005
Ow!

58
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:47,494
Go play in the backyard.

59
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:51,364
You too, Benji. Go on.

60
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:04,077
How are you feeling?

61
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:08,081
Much better. Uh, my
throat still hurts though.

62
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:09,983
I took the phone off the hook.

63
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:12,686
They showed our house on the TV news.

64
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:14,788
They're interviewing
the neighbors about us.

65
00:06:14,856 --> 00:06:19,226
It'll pass. I'm home honey,
I'm fine. We're gonna be fine.

66
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:23,997
What if you have to go
back to the hospital?

67
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:26,166
I'm not going back to the hospital.

68
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:28,168
Well you told me that one of the doctors

69
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:29,520
- wanted to quarantine you.
- Ann Marie!

70
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,023
What if he finds out
that you're still sick?

71
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:40,297
They kept showing footage of
the plane just sitting there.

72
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:43,553
Dark dead on the tarmac
over and over again.

73
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:46,636
Like the Trade Centre, remember?

74
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:50,140
Why do they do that to us?
It's so painful to watch.

75
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:52,475
I knew you shouldn't
have gone on that trip.

76
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:57,180
- Ann Marie!
- I just... I get so overwhelmed

77
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:59,649
when you're gone.

78
00:06:59,717 --> 00:07:04,154
Gertie got out once. She
was missing all night.

79
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:07,958
She came back hurt, but I
just hate chaining her up

80
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:10,126
- in the shed.
- Wait Gertie came back hurt?

81
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:13,897
She was hit with something.

82
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:16,599
Ah!

83
00:07:19,203 --> 00:07:21,438
You came back hurt, too.

84
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:31,147
Do you hear that?

85
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:35,352
Please, Ansel. Go back to bed.

86
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,655
You have to get better, OK?

87
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:52,102
The documents that have
been haphazardly released

88
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,604
through the internet paints
an incomplete, distorted

89
00:07:54,672 --> 00:07:58,108
and untrue picture of
my airline's protocols.

90
00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:00,076
We're maintaining the highest level

91
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:02,312
of safety in our industry.

92
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,250
Pest control services, hold please.

93
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:10,320
I have made safety my
number one priority...

94
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:18,495
we must wait for the NTSB's full report...

95
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:20,897
The phone keeps ringing
but all I want to do

96
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:23,166
- is watch this airplane coverage.
- Any allegations...

97
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:25,735
I'm never flying again.

98
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:28,772
Of the aircraft being unsound
is categorically untrue.

99
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:33,209
I mean shouldn't this man
be arrested or something?

100
00:08:33,277 --> 00:08:35,578
He'll probably get a bonus.

101
00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:38,314
This is a week's worth
of rat calls in one day.

102
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:42,252
Why so many, huh? Why? Why so many?

103
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:44,254
It's not a "why" business, Vasiliy.

104
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:47,757
This is a "now" business. Rat
bite. First on your list today.

105
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:49,793
Mayor's office special request.

106
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,761
I don't work for the Mayor.

107
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:55,065
- I do, and you work for me.
- I got an elementary school,

108
00:08:55,132 --> 00:08:57,667
a hospital and a church and you
want me to go to this guy first?

109
00:08:57,735 --> 00:09:00,370
His daughter was bitten by a muncher,

110
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:02,972
and he's a hedge fund manager
and a major contributor.

111
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,975
So yes, you will go there
first and you will be

112
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:08,011
- on your best behavior. Got it?
- I'll wear my top hat

113
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:12,082
- and monocle.
- Just don't piss him off, alright?

114
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,921
Neck rigidity, sensitivity
to natural light,

115
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:20,824
mental disorientation.
All clinical features

116
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:22,826
of a central nervous system infection.

117
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:26,262
It could be a PAM, primary
amebic meningoencephalitis.

118
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,264
A very rare parasitic meningitis.

119
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:30,366
It's a bloodworm, and a nasty one.

120
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:32,435
I know I'm asking a lot of you but

121
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:34,404
I'd appreciate it if
you'd all hang in there

122
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:36,106
and develop a protocol for
Captain Redfern's treatment.

123
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:38,875
I need all hands on deck here. Thank you.

124
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:50,587
Doctor, I'm scared. Am I going to die?

125
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:55,058
Doyle, we're going to find
out what's infecting you,

126
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:59,775
and we're going to make you well again.

127
00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:02,311
You have my word.

128
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:16,125
- You can't promise him that.
- He's stuck in a plastic

129
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:18,961
containment tube, surrounded by
doctors who don't know anything.

130
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:21,197
He needs a little hope.

131
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:25,201
My hearing with Zack's in 45 minutes.

132
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,169
- Go, Redfern's covered.
- Alright, just let me know

133
00:10:27,237 --> 00:10:29,205
if anything changes. And we
have to check up on the health

134
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:31,207
- of the other survivors, too.
- And I want talk

135
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:34,043
- to that old man.
- Who?

136
00:10:34,077 --> 00:10:37,179
The one we had arrested at the airport.

137
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:39,148
He knew things, Eph.

138
00:10:39,216 --> 00:10:41,784
Fine. Anything, just...

139
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:44,620
Yes. I'll call you.

140
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:47,156
Where the hell is Jim?

141
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,320
Mr. Jim Kent.

142
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:07,789
I'm here to see Greg.

143
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:09,791
Yes, Greg could not be present.

144
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:13,828
But we got your call.
Urgent, from the sound of it.

145
00:11:13,896 --> 00:11:15,963
Well I'll come back another time, then...

146
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:18,733
You are a member of the Canary Project,

147
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:22,170
the CDC's rapid response
team of field epidemiologists?

148
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:26,040
- Who are you?
- I presume you're here about

149
00:11:26,108 --> 00:11:29,010
the airplane cargo. The box?

150
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:31,979
I don't know what you're talking about.

151
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:35,116
I refer specifically to
an ornately-carved cabinet

152
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:40,021
you allowed out of the
airport security perimeter.

153
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:44,826
I made a deal with Greg
to provide some information

154
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:48,529
and let a piece of medical
cargo through customs. That's it.

155
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:51,165
Yes, and here is the rest of the money

156
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:53,935
Greg promised you in return.

157
00:12:00,075 --> 00:12:04,011
What was in the box? Where are the corpses?

158
00:12:05,914 --> 00:12:08,182
I'm going to the police.

159
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,286
You must love your wife very much.

160
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,626
- What?
- To violate your terms

161
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:21,696
of employment and to break the law.

162
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:25,166
I understand there is a very
promising monoclonal antibody

163
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:28,138
trial for her form of cancer in Palo Alto.

164
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:33,167
30000 people applied but
only 100 were accepted

165
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:36,803
and your Sylvia was cruelly denied.

166
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:39,105
How do you know that? I
never said anything to Greg.

167
00:12:39,173 --> 00:12:42,508
Our company finances the
entire research program.

168
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:47,547
The decision can be reversed.

169
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:49,816
It is not too late

170
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:53,052
to see Sylvia admitted to the trial.

171
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:07,233
I'm only doing this to
pay for her treatment.

172
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:10,203
Not only do I think you
will not go to the police.

173
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,073
I feel confident that we may continue

174
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:17,400
to rely on your good services.

175
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:25,809
You have two bosses now, Jim Kent.

176
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:30,914
The ones you report to at the CDC, and me.

177
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,193
Criminal trespass

178
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:46,429
and interference with
a criminal investigation

179
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:52,335
Mister uh, is it
Set-rake-ian, Set-rack-ian?

180
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:57,274
- As you like, Your Honor.
- Mr. Set-rack-ian,

181
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:59,175
what in the name of John
F. Kennedy were you doing

182
00:13:59,243 --> 00:14:01,177
at the airport Saturday night?

183
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:08,184
I, uh, saw a story on
television about a plane

184
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:12,822
that landed, I... I guess I'm
not quite sure, Your Honor.

185
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,525
I'm old an uh, things are
not that clear anymore.

186
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:20,697
I have here that you own a pawn shop,

187
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:24,434
Knickerbocker Loans and
Curios on East 118th street?

188
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:29,439
Yes, sir. All licensed and, uh, registered.

189
00:14:29,507 --> 00:14:33,076
I... , I came here after World War II

190
00:14:33,144 --> 00:14:36,413
after the, uh, the camps were liberated.

191
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,418
Anybody live with you? Any family?

192
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:43,653
I'm a widower, Your Honor.

193
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:45,522
Children, grandchildren?

194
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:47,724
We were never so blessed.

195
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:53,663
Trespassing is a nuisance charge,

196
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:57,600
but what does concern me is this.

197
00:14:57,668 --> 00:15:01,871
This is a concealed weapon, Mr. Setrakian.

198
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:05,041
And we have strict laws in New York City.

199
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:08,611
I... it, it is an
antique piece, Your Honor,

200
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:12,015
th... that I use for my mobility only.

201
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,085
It is of great sentimental value, uh,

202
00:15:15,152 --> 00:15:20,090
a family trophy, you might
say. I... I will have the blade

203
00:15:20,157 --> 00:15:24,661
removed and melted, y... you have my word.

204
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:30,633
Trade it for a nice aluminum
cane with a rubber foot.

205
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:32,702
Case dismissed.

206
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,206
Thank you, Your Honor.

207
00:15:39,243 --> 00:15:42,012
How much of that was an act?

208
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,981
- Do I know you?
- I'm Dr. Nora Martinez from

209
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:48,218
the CDC. We met at the airport.

210
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:50,620
OK I get it. You're upset.

211
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:54,891
You're here because the
bodies have disappeared.

212
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,294
- Do you know where they are?
- I know where they're going.

213
00:15:58,362 --> 00:16:01,898
Going? Sir, please. Come with me. Help us.

214
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:05,735
- Already it may be too late.
- Too late for what?

215
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:08,338
What was in that coffin?

216
00:16:08,406 --> 00:16:12,175
A thing of enormous
power and terrible will.

217
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:15,945
A will to devour the world
and swallow the light.

218
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:18,148
Is the military covering it up?

219
00:16:18,215 --> 00:16:20,517
Do not be so easily distracted.

220
00:16:20,584 --> 00:16:22,719
He thrives on human self-interest

221
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:24,788
and bureaucratic complacency.

222
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:27,957
You and Dr. Goodweather,

223
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:30,427
you think that being good is enough?

224
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:34,330
Being good means nothing,
unless you are willing to do

225
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:37,267
what needs to be done,
when it needs to be done.

226
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:40,336
OK then tell me. What needs to be done?

227
00:16:40,404 --> 00:16:43,673
You have a complete
passenger manifest with you?

228
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:45,642
Not right here, why?

229
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:48,978
Because you need to
find every last passenger

230
00:16:49,046 --> 00:16:52,082
and destroy the bodies and
anyone in contact with them.

231
00:16:55,386 --> 00:16:58,621
This is pointless. You're not ready.

232
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:00,657
Explain to my why, if they're already dead,

233
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:03,460
we need to destroy the bodies?

234
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:05,962
Until you are willing to
do what needs to be done,

235
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,332
you're of no use to me.

236
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,569
I have a few questions for you, Zachary.

237
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,571
And it's important that you understand

238
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,607
that there are no right or wrong answers.

239
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:23,642
The court will make
all final determinations

240
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,912
but your input is important.

241
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,418
Zachary, what do you think
would be the best solution

242
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:37,490
for your mom and dad, regarding
custody and visitation rights?

243
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:41,160
Well, I guess I think that...

244
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,696
I know that they both
want what's best for me.

245
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:46,999
What do you think would be best for you?

246
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,974
I feel like, if my dad could visit

247
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,010
like one or two weekends a month,

248
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,246
that would be really good.

249
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,082
Because he has a really
important job, and this way

250
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,584
he wouldn't be too stressed
about being late or having

251
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,587
- something come up.
- Um excuse me, Your Honor,

252
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,213
I think there's been a mistake.
I think ah, what he means

253
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,082
to say is that...

254
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,864
- joint custody would be...
- Dr. Goodweather, you need...

255
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:18,509
No, no. It's the way
you asked the question,

256
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:18,937
- so just, ask it again.
- Dr. Goodweather!

257
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:22,735
I want what's best for my dad, that's all.

258
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:42,733
- Are you good?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

259
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,706
Just, give me a second, OK?

260
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,912
Hey...

261
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,849
Are you OK?

262
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,727
How could Zack not know
he's the most important thing

263
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:08,096
in the world to me?

264
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:17,698
Telling him is one thing.
Showing it, proving it...

265
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:21,438
it's the little things, day
in, day out, that's everything.

266
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:27,215
You can still have
that, Eph. Zack needs it.

267
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:30,090
Regardless of the ruling the judge imposed.

268
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:31,603
Anytime you want to see him,

269
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,708
so long as you give me some notice.

270
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:39,443
Oh you're loving this, huh?
You take Zack away from me.

271
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,513
I never thought you'd be one to gloat.

272
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,739
You coached Zack! You tried to coerce him

273
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,881
- into say what you wanted.
- I love my son and I will do

274
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:50,592
- anything for him.
- It wasn't enough that he had

275
00:19:50,593 --> 00:19:52,809
to get up there and choose
between his mother and father?

276
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,254
- I never asked him to choose.
- He spoke from his heart

277
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:58,705
in there and he did what he
thought was best for you, Eph.

278
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,718
Not him. You.

279
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,815
Hold up, hold up, hold up!

280
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,719
Ears, guys. Check it out. Hold on.

281
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:24,021
How 'bout another go at it?

282
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:32,066
Between that airplane
thing, and you taking a bite

283
00:20:32,134 --> 00:20:36,470
outta that girl, your
downloads are up ten-fold.

284
00:20:36,538 --> 00:20:39,373
And the YouTube video
has over 2 million views.

285
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:45,246
We just need you focused.
Timing is everything, Gabe.

286
00:20:45,314 --> 00:20:47,214
Your cash machine has a cold.

287
00:20:47,282 --> 00:20:53,254
Flu or something. No voice, no concert.

288
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:08,436
Hello?

289
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:13,107
Mr. Arnot?

290
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:27,288
It's Dr. Goodweather from the
Centres for Disease Control.

291
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:52,513
Mr. Arnot?

292
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:42,930
Hey, Nora. Have any of the
personal effects of the deceased

293
00:22:42,998 --> 00:22:45,566
been returned to the next
of kin, by any chance?

294
00:22:45,634 --> 00:22:49,336
What? What! When? OK, I'm on my way.

295
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,819
This thing was on her
pillow. When she woke up,

296
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:18,355
- bit her in the face.
- Hm.

297
00:23:18,422 --> 00:23:21,791
I want this rat found and killed.

298
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,394
I'm not here to rehabilitate it.

299
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:26,329
Can we speed this up, then?

300
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:29,366
This Regis Air fiasco's
crushing my portfolio.

301
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:31,368
Market opened down 600
points, we're already into

302
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:33,370
program selling, my phone's
blowing up and I'm stuck here

303
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:35,805
- waiting on you.
- Ah.

304
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:40,844
- Scary, huh, hun?
- Yes.

305
00:23:40,912 --> 00:23:44,681
Yeah. Seven times I've been bitten already

306
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:48,752
and I know it doesn't tickle, eh?

307
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:50,787
You know... rats, they have bad eyes

308
00:23:50,855 --> 00:23:53,156
but a very keen sense of smell and taste.

309
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:56,393
That's why they usually bite
children around the mouth.

310
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:02,299
Because that's where the
food smell is, you understand?

311
00:24:02,366 --> 00:24:05,635
You stick right here, I'll
be right back. Yeah? Alright.

312
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:40,036
Here, hold this.

313
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,905
No, I don't... I don't want this.

314
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:46,509
- What is that?
- Anesthetic.

315
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:51,948
Cubans, huh? Cohiba Maduro 5's.

316
00:24:52,016 --> 00:24:56,953
Like smoking coffee and cream.
50 bucks a piece though, eh?

317
00:24:57,021 --> 00:25:02,392
You know a customer of mine,
he gave me one of those once.

318
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:11,134
You know who else likes cigars? Do you?

319
00:25:11,202 --> 00:25:17,540
Rats. This neighborhood was
still a slum in 1931, yeah.

320
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:21,044
Put up this building and
knocked down a cigar factory.

321
00:25:21,112 --> 00:25:23,780
And they built right over
the original foundation.

322
00:25:23,848 --> 00:25:26,783
You paid what? 14 and a quarter million

323
00:25:26,851 --> 00:25:28,952
for this six bedroom duplex?

324
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,756
It's on Zillow. This place
has changed hands three times

325
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,058
in the past seven years
and now you know why.

326
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:37,093
Alright!

327
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:42,932
Hey hun, no more eating in
bed, alright? Is that a deal?

328
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,305
- Deal.
- Alright. Have a nice day.

329
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,350
Sylvia?

330
00:26:37,088 --> 00:26:40,490
- Hey, that was quick.
- Hey.

331
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:43,026
- You got my text?
- What text?

332
00:26:43,094 --> 00:26:47,964
Stanford called. There
was a clerical error.

333
00:26:48,032 --> 00:26:53,036
They are accepting me into the drug trial.

334
00:26:53,104 --> 00:26:56,439
I'm one of the lucky 100.

335
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:01,845
- That's great.
- You were right.

336
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:04,447
You said never give up hope

337
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:10,587
and good things happen to
good people, right? Right?

338
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:58,968
Ansel... drink.

339
00:28:14,885 --> 00:28:16,886
Ansel... drink.

340
00:28:16,954 --> 00:28:19,155
Ansel...

341
00:28:58,221 --> 00:29:00,155
So pre-tour jitters,
huh? I get that, totally.

342
00:29:00,223 --> 00:29:03,825
Tranquilizers'll take the edge off nicely.

343
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:06,061
You've heard of the "morning after" pill?

344
00:29:06,128 --> 00:29:08,730
Well Klonopin is the "night before" pill.

345
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:13,134
I'm hearing things, Doc. Strange things.

346
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:15,837
- Voices, right? Get that too.
- One voice, it's calling

347
00:29:15,905 --> 00:29:17,672
- my name. A distant pounding...
- Mmhm. Yep.

348
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,942
- I can't focus.
- Alrighty, all over that.

349
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,511
And we'll throw a little
Adderall in there to help you

350
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:26,448
remember those lyrics, eh?

351
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:30,518
Alrighty, any other
"performance" related issues?

352
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:33,088
Well, now that you mention it.

353
00:29:33,155 --> 00:29:36,725
Agh! Oh.

354
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:39,194
Yeah, that does not... look good.

355
00:29:39,262 --> 00:29:41,162
What I need for you to do right now

356
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,298
is to have somebody drive
you to the nearest hospital.

357
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:45,667
And I mean like, yesterday.

358
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,771
And what have these pictures
up on Gawker 10 minutes later?

359
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:52,841
No way, Doc. You need to do something.

360
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:55,543
No, we are way beyond that.

361
00:29:55,611 --> 00:29:58,480
This is so out of my bandwidth.

362
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,616
Look, I know a urologist
who might be persuaded

363
00:30:01,684 --> 00:30:04,019
to make an emergency house-call.

364
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:06,588
Trust me she's very discreet.

365
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:25,484
Next time, challenge me.

366
00:30:28,388 --> 00:30:31,257
Yes, very good.

367
00:30:31,325 --> 00:30:33,759
- Were all the names here?
- Every damn passenger.

368
00:30:33,827 --> 00:30:36,395
You want their social security numbers?

369
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:39,131
Email passwords? Facebook? Twitter?

370
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:42,501
Whatever you want, I can get it.

371
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:48,474
And here's your
video-gaming waste of time.

372
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:51,043
Why do you want that list anyway?

373
00:30:51,111 --> 00:30:55,481
I'm going to visit their
families. Pay my respects.

374
00:31:08,362 --> 00:31:10,997
This speed of progression
is medically impossible.

375
00:31:11,064 --> 00:31:13,132
We need to get him into surgery,
find out what's happening

376
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,967
inside him right now.
We'll prep him right here.

377
00:31:15,035 --> 00:31:17,737
We're getting the operating
room ready. It won't be long.

378
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:20,606
Doyle.

379
00:31:20,674 --> 00:31:23,142
Here. He's here.

380
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,748
Who, Captain Redfern? Who's here?

381
00:31:58,111 --> 00:32:00,146
What's happening?

382
00:32:03,016 --> 00:32:05,051
I don't know.

383
00:32:05,118 --> 00:32:08,454
Right now we just need to save his life.

384
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:12,825
Secretary Pierson announced today

385
00:32:12,893 --> 00:32:15,394
that the CDC is no longer
investigating a pathogen

386
00:32:15,462 --> 00:32:17,596
as the cause of the deaths
on Regis Air flight 753.

387
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,565
This is most certainly in
response to the recent leak

388
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:23,416
of documents containing records
of problems with Regis Air

389
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,822
- My daughter, Emma.
- Documents point

390
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,927
- to monoxide leak as the cause.
- I just want to see her again.

391
00:32:35,482 --> 00:32:37,516
Mom?

392
00:32:42,022 --> 00:32:43,923
Mom?

393
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:31,470
- Mom are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, come here sweetie.

394
00:33:34,841 --> 00:33:36,776
It's OK.

395
00:33:39,913 --> 00:33:42,181
Mom's OK.

396
00:33:44,551 --> 00:33:46,886
We're gonna be OK.

397
00:33:51,491 --> 00:33:54,393
- Just stay with me, OK?
- OK.

398
00:33:57,831 --> 00:34:00,800
The airline industry has been shaken

399
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:04,837
by the recent tragedy at JFK.
A sharp falloff in airline

400
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:09,041
revenues over the past several
days indicates customers

401
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:12,778
are nervous about traveling
after the mysterious deaths

402
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:16,182
of 206 passengers aboard
Regis Air flight 753.

403
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:18,984
As you can see, Regis' stock
is in a free-fall, plummeting...

404
00:34:19,052 --> 00:34:21,353
Who the hell are you?

405
00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:23,456
How the hell'd you get in here?

406
00:34:23,523 --> 00:34:27,093
- The door was open.
- No it wasn't.

407
00:34:31,763 --> 00:34:34,398
Would you like to write a note?

408
00:34:34,465 --> 00:34:38,668
- A note?
- Regrets? Repentance?

409
00:34:38,736 --> 00:34:42,005
Guilt?

410
00:34:42,073 --> 00:34:44,241
Wha...

411
00:34:44,308 --> 00:34:46,309
Ah! Ah!

412
00:34:50,915 --> 00:34:52,916
OK, uh. Uh.

413
00:34:52,984 --> 00:34:55,419
What are you doing?

414
00:34:55,486 --> 00:34:58,989
No. No! No! Wait!

415
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:02,025
D... Don't!

416
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:45,715
Hey guys, sorry.

417
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,723
Where the hell have you
been? We've been calling you.

418
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:50,844
We can't find any of the other
3 survivors or even Gary Arnot.

419
00:37:50,844 --> 00:37:53,145
Redfern's going into emergency surgery.

420
00:37:53,213 --> 00:37:55,647
Jim, what's the matter?

421
00:37:55,715 --> 00:38:00,018
Ah. You know the new, um,
monoclonal antibody trial

422
00:38:00,086 --> 00:38:07,186
they're doing at Stanford?
They accepted Sylvia, after all.

423
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:10,022
I... they must have made
some sort of clerical mistake

424
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,291
or something... I don't know.
But, it's insane, she's in.

425
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:14,827
That's great.

426
00:38:14,894 --> 00:38:16,662
Paging Dr. Goodweather.

427
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,298
Dr. Goodweather to the ISO unit, stat.

428
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:27,640
Dr. Goodweather. Your patient... he's gone.

429
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:29,675
- He coded?
- No, he's gone.

430
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:32,344
He was ready for surgery, I left

431
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:36,081
to make final preparations...
He was only alone for a minute.

432
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:38,751
Alright, spread out.
He's still here somewhere,

433
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:41,587
so is whoever took him. Jim,
conference us in on our phones.

434
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,191
Hey! Hey, did you see
a patient come by here

435
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:48,260
about five minutes ago?
Probably pushing a wheelchair,

436
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:50,329
bald, very sick?

437
00:38:50,397 --> 00:38:52,865
Nothing here. No sign of him.

438
00:38:52,932 --> 00:38:55,100
Is anybody up high? Anybody got a view?

439
00:38:56,803 --> 00:39:00,105
- Nothing, I don't see anything.
- I'm checking downstairs

440
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:08,047
- Jim, where are you?
- In the basement.

441
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,586
OK I found him. He's in the kitchen.

442
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:26,558
The kitchen in the basement,
Eph, you got... Eph?

443
00:39:39,572 --> 00:39:42,741
Captain Redfern?

444
00:39:49,582 --> 00:39:51,182
Jim...

445
00:39:52,752 --> 00:39:54,652
Jim.

446
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:58,022
Captain Redfern.

447
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,569
Jim?

448
00:40:11,637 --> 00:40:14,439
- Eph!
- Doyle, what are you doing?

449
00:40:14,507 --> 00:40:17,656
Stay away from him.

450
00:41:06,228 --> 00:41:08,363
- Stop it!
- All right!

451
00:41:14,003 --> 00:41:17,005
Oh God.

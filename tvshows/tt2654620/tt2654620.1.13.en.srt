1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:04,036
- (narrator): <i>Previously on</i>
<i>the strain...</i>

2
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:08,073
- (creem): What the hell?
What is it, man?

3
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:12,011
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

4
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,814
- (gus): Where you taking me?
Get your hands off me!

5
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,883
(tires screeching)

6
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:19,885
- He's nesting somewhere
in the city.

7
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:21,887
We can find him
if we work together.

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,823
- Have you come here
to destroy me?

9
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:28,560
(explosions)
(screaming)

10
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,629
- We've got him on the run.
We must press on!

11
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,531
(growling)

12
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:37,970
- Thank you!
(cackling)

13
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:49,214

15
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,470
- Sir?
- Come along, mr. Fitzwilliam.

16
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,266
I want all this boxed up

17
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:45,370
And brought back to my office.
- Right away, sir.

18
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:54,012
- That can stay.

19
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:12,297
Take special care
of this valuable item.

20
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,900
- Certainly, sir.

21
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,347
- Silver. How quaint!

22
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:36,255
- Eldritch. Look at you!

23
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,025
How are you feeling?

24
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,797
- I expected it
to be traumatic,

25
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:49,101
To say the least.
But I feel wonderful!

26
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,970
- Huh!
- Strong, energized,

27
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,206
No pain...

28
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,175
When does my, uh...

29
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:59,711
- Oh... Did you think
you had been turned?

30
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,947
The master
gave you

31
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:05,551
The white, yes,
but not the worm.

32
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,886
- He gave me health

33
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:11,123
But not immortality?

34
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,694
Ugh...

35
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:20,299
- He visited you
in your hour of need.

36
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:24,503
He spared you the way
of almost all flesh.

37
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,339
- How long will this last?
- I don't know.

38
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:30,309
- But not forever.
- Oh, no.

39
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:34,179
- You're turning people right
and left all across this town,

40
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,882
Yet I'm on some...
Some sort of

41
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,318
Waiting list?

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,587
- True, they are being turned,

43
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:45,891
But being turned
the way you seek, well...

44
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,860
That is a far
different thing.

45
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,730
- I've done too much,
come too far

46
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:55,934
To be treated this way.
- He chose you, eldritch!

47
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:59,638
He anointed you.

48
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:05,344
You will serve at his
right hand for eternity.

49
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:08,347
Eventually.

50
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,949
- "eventually"? When?

51
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:13,218
- Think of this
as another test

52
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,688
For your everlasting devotion.

53
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,863
(theme music)

54
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,048
- (kelly): Thanks, buddy.

55
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,050
- Oh, my god,
this is so cool!

56
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:49,187
Thanks, mom!
- It's from dad, too, okay?

57
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,893
Let's bring it on the street,
let's bring this down...

58
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,162
Oh, and I want to take some
video to send to your dad

59
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,730
While he's at his conference
in atlanta.

60
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,452
- I'll go around the corner
and circle back.

61
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:02,501
- Perfect. Watch out...
- for a car.

62
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:06,338
- For cars, you got it.

63
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,583
- Hey, dad, we miss you!

64
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,486
Thanks, mom, I love my bike.

65
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,822
- I love you too, honey.

66
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,326
(gunshots echoing)

67
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,161
(gunshots continue)

68
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:34,032
(men talking indistinctly)

69
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,510
- (eph): So why did we see
all those vampires in one spot?

70
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,546
- (abraham) safety.
Without the coffin,

71
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:51,283
The master needs to be protected
during daylight hours.

72
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:54,152
- So those 500 or 1,000
down there...

73
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:58,390
- They were his security. The
master will be nesting nearby.

74
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,228
- So, whatever's
aboveground here,

75
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,565
It's important to him. It's
gotta be dark or protected...

76
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,633
- Most likely both.

77
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:12,037
- Did you just agree with me?

78
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,339
- In this instance, yes.

79
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:18,543
(scoffs)
- you two are falling in love.

80
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:22,214
It's a beautiful thing, huh?
My vote:

81
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,217
Reconnaissance.
Now, doc and I, we go down

82
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,153
To vestry and washington
and see what's there, yeah?

83
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,322
And we should move.

84
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,257
We wanna burn as little
daylight as possible.

85
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,394
- Excellent idea.

86
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,429
- I heard you guys talking.
What's going on?

87
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,398
- Uh, we're just
discussing our plans.

88
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,001
- Are you going to try
to attack him again?

89
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,137
- We most certainly are.

90
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,409
- We're just, uh... Fet and I

91
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,711
Are going down to tribeca
to check some things out.

92
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:55,914
- What about me?
- You? Uh, get dressed!

93
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,083
We'll be back
before you know it.

94
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,285
- When can we go home?

95
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,990
- Zach, we can't go back.

96
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,706
I'd appreciate it
if you let me decide

97
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,809
What I want to tell my own son.

98
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:27,078
- Sheltering him will ultimately
only make things worse.

99
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,215
He needs to know the truth.
The whole truth.

100
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,717
Including what happened
to his mother.

101
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,253
- That's not your decision
to make. Keep your mouth shut.

102
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,924
- Shortest honeymoon
on record, huh?

103
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:42,527
Come on, doc.
We're burning daylight.

104
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,941
(metallic clang)

105
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,743
- (gus): Who's there? Huh?

106
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:05,650
You must be real scared
to have me tied up like this.

107
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,888
You scared to look a mexican
in his eye, you coward? Huh?

108
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,831
That's more like it.

109
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,067
What is this shithole?

110
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,606
What the hell are you?
(growling)

111
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,812
You planning on
eating mexican tonight?

112
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,448
You gonna choke,
I promise you that shit.

113
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,451
- I did not bring you
all the way down here

114
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,486
To drink you.

115
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:45,357
- Down here where, huh?
- Deep underground.

116
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,225
Somewhere safe.

117
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,561
- Safe from what?
(growling)

118
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,097
What are you gonna
do with that, huh?

119
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,308
- You be patient.

120
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,181
- So what do you
wanna do, huh?

121
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:13,485
Wanna just talk,
have a conversation?

122
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,390
(groaning)
- bad idea.

123
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,659
- Damn it!
- Come with me.

124
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,840
- This is the heart of one
who has been turned.

125
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:39,377
I thought it would make
a nicely ironic addition

126
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,514
To my collection
of my own failed organs.

127
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:46,017
- If you say so, sir.
- Apparently,

128
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:50,288
Dr. Goodweather made
an unauthorized broadcast

129
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,524
Last night, using
the emergency alert system.

130
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:56,027
Why was I not
made aware of this?

131
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:59,264
- You were dying, sir.
It didn't seem important.

132
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,399
- Well, it was important
enough that

133
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,369
The secretary of health and
human services, maggie pierson,

134
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:07,839
Is talking about quarantining
all of manhattan.

135
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,544
I need to have
a serious chat with her.

136
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:15,947
Bring the car around.
Contact eichhorst.

137
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,016
- No, sir.

138
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,890
- Excuse me?
- Won't do it.

139
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,626
Not anymore.

140
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,761
When people called you cruel

141
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,731
And selfish, I defended you.

142
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:36,434
I said they didn't know you
as I know you.

143
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,937
Then eichhorst showed up
and his ilk,

144
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,905
And I told myself it was them,

145
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,808
Manipulating you,
warping your judgment.

146
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,077
I was wrong.

147
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,280
- You've been by my side
the entire time.

148
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:52,417
- Yes, I am complicit,
because I served you loyally.

149
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:56,488
- This is the part where the
whore declares herself a virgin.

150
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,658
- You made a devil's bargain.
You pulled me into it with you.

151
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,760
Your sudden resurrection

152
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:04,295
Is an affront to nature
and to god.

153
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:07,766
- What a load of horse shit!
You self-righteous

154
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:11,803
Son of a bitch!
How dare you defy me!

155
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,639
- Part of me thinks
I should kill you right now,

156
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:18,009
Restore the natural
order of things.

157
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,978
But I can't.

158
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,015
Not after all you did for me.

159
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:28,386
Consider my debt to you
paid in full.

160
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,355
Never come after me.

161
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,624
- You fool!

162
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:35,293
Deserting me when we're
on the verge of triumph!

163
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,630
Where will you go?

164
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:41,433
What will you do
without me to protect you?

165
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,070
- The question is, sir,

166
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:49,240
What will you do
without me to protect you?

167
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,963
(men arguing indistinctly)

168
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,135
(sirens approaching)

169
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,776
- That goth douche bag.

170
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,015
- Uh, share the wealth, doc?
- Bolivar? The one who

171
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,217
Attacked nora's mother? He was
one of the four survivors

172
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:36,087
On the plane. He said he was
buying a theater in tribeca.

173
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,724
He's living there.
- He bought the vestry, huh?

174
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:43,294
Oh, this place goes
all the way back to vaudeville,

175
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:46,765
You know? And since then, it's
been a silent movie theater,

176
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:51,269
Yiddish stage, speakeasy,
uh, burlesque house...

177
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,973
This boulevard is one of
the master's favorite vamps.

178
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:58,543
- Then there's a high
probability the master's inside.

179
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,380
- Probability's not
gonna cut it, doc.

180
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:05,116
We need to know
for sure, you know?

181
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,719
(fet mumbling to himself)

182
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,656
- What?

183
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,328
- You know how I said that
theater used to be a speakeasy?

184
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,697
- Yeah, and...
- Yeah.

185
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:36,147
In the '20s, this place
was called hawk's tavern.

186
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,617
It was run by a gambler named
diamond jim o'brien

187
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:43,488
Who also owned the vestry hall
across the way.

188
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,958
But diamond jim,
he was a legend

189
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,127
During the manhattan
bootleg wars

190
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,796
Because his place had been
raided so many times

191
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,933
But never found any booze.
You know why?

192
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:57,268
- I don't need to,
you're going to tell me.

193
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,003
- They never found
any booze because

194
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,639
He built a secret tunnel,

195
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:05,643
A tunnel that he connected
to the sewer tunnel

196
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:09,047
That connected
to the theater, huh?

197
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:12,884
That's how they ran
the booze back and forth.

198
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:21,226
No vampires.
That's a good sign.

199
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,111
(feeling along wall)

200
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:46,951
He used to have, uh, secret
latches to unlock the door.

201
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,725
(loud clanking)

202
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,594
Not bad.

203
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,997
- Alcoholic's
sixth sense for booze.

204
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:02,767
- Huh.
(unpacking)

205
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:06,537
- What are you doing? We're not
going in there without backup.

206
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,741
- I'm your backup.
We got weapons.

207
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,076
- We have 30 bullets between us.
We don't know what's on

208
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,512
The other side of that door.
- It's just recon, doc,

209
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,981
You know? A little
sneak and peek. Come on.

210
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,820
(heavy door opening)

211
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,270
There it is.

212
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,006
The old sewer tunnel.

213
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:49,213
(door creaking)

214
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,652
Whoa.

215
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,322
Look, smell and listen, huh?

216
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,361
Look over this way.

217
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:09,300
Look at this! Wow!

218
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,103
To haul liquor up and down

219
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,839
During prohibition.

220
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:17,141
This is our stop.

221
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,852
Come on up.

222
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,921
Coast is clear.

223
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,523
- Coffin.

224
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:09,694
They're reassembling it.

225
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,964
- The master must be
around here somewhere.

226
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:16,901
Huh?
(vampires growling)

227
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,482
- Okay, that's
enough recon.

228
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,662
Let's get the others
while it's still daylight.

229
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,368
What the hell are you doing?

230
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,237
- "the secret to all victory

231
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,941
Lies in the organization of the
non-obvious." marcus aurelius.

232
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,903
We're gonna flood the sewer
tunnels with sunlight.

233
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:01,379
We don't want any more munchers
to get into the theater

234
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,648
Before we come back.

235
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,518
- Come on.

236
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,129
- Do not pull the plug on me!
Ugh, god!

237
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,768
I am trying to gauge the impact
of our pirate broadcast,

238
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,736
But all the channels are gone.

239
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,473
- Well, I think that's
your answer, right there.

240
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,788
- What...
- We've got work to do.

241
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,895
(singing in a foreign language)

242
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,660
- Tell me you found something.

243
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:26,030
- The master's at bolivar's
theater in tribeca.

244
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,299
The coffin is there -
at least, pieces of it.

245
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,635
- When do we leave?

246
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,336
- I can't go.

247
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,540
- Because of zach?

248
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,175
- Kelly's gonna find him
sooner or later.

249
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:40,378
I can't leave him alone again.
- So bring him.

250
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,380
- To bolivar's? Are you crazy?
We didn't go 30 feet

251
00:19:42,404 --> 00:19:45,216
Before we ran into vampires.
- Open your eyes, eph. Where

252
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:48,519
I grew up, people disappeared
in the middle of the night.

253
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:52,690
You do not have the luxury
of choice anymore.

254
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,460
All we can do now is fight.

255
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,298
If you want
to protect zach,

256
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,202
Just keep him
by your side. Always.

257
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,038
And we'll see
this thing through.

258
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,143
- (pierson): Every bridge
and turnpike.

259
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:15,246
Shut down all the airports,
the ferries, tunnels.

260
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,348
Nothing gets through.

261
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,317
- Something always
gets through.

262
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,520
We're gonna need every national
guard unit in the northeast.

263
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,755
(knocking on the door)

264
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,831
- Eldritch!
What are you doing here?

265
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,768
- Preventing you from making
a grave mistake, maggie.

266
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:44,508
- Where's mr. Fitzwilliam?

267
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,012
- On leave.

268
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:51,449
This is a colleague of mine,
thomas eichhorst.

269
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,217
Secretary pierson,

270
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,886
Everett barnes, with the cdc.

271
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:58,422
- A pleasure.

272
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,759
- Eldritch, you look
amazingly well. How did...

273
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,762
- Wonderful new medicine.
Soon to be all the rage.

274
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,964
Now, maggie...
- Eldritch,

275
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:09,967
Someone has lied to you.
Either that,

276
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,969
Or you've been less than
truthful with me.

277
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:14,805
- You think I lied to you?

278
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,275
- Whatever happened, the
situation was misrepresented.

279
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:21,812
Now, I have a call in one hour
with the president.

280
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,915
I am strongly recommending
that he declare martial law

281
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:28,586
In new york city and order
a complete quarantine.

282
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,955
- You're panicking, maggie.
It will mean the end

283
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,991
Of your career.
- (scoffs): My career?

284
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:38,629
Human beings are being converted
into these horrible monsters!

285
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:42,166
We have absolute proof.
I know it sounds preposterous.

286
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:44,902
- Preposterous, indeed.
- At the end of the day,

287
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,471
Eldritch, my loyalty is
to the american people,

288
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:51,108
Not to you. I'm sorry.
- Maggie,

289
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,811
Could you and I
have a private talk?

290
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:16,867
- Have you been in mr. Palmer's
employ for very long?

291
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:21,639
- Oh, I'm not in his employ.

292
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:25,376
(clearing throat)

293
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:28,346
- Your accent...
Are you from germany?

294
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,548
- Originally.

295
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:35,820
- Uh... I once was in munich
for a conference.

296
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:38,322
I didn't care for it.

297
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:41,058
- You wouldn't.

298
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,828
(chuckling)

299
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,498
Oh, looks like the
conversation's coming to an end.

300
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,701
(screaming)

301
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:55,806
- Oh, my god! Maggie...
Oh, my god!

302
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,721
- And this one?

303
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,860
- Dr. Barnes,
do you have any thoughts

304
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:18,662
On how to deal with
this so-called crisis?

305
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,531
- Crisis? What crisis?

306
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:24,034
- Well, say you were promoted
to secretary of health

307
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:27,738
And human services in the wake
of maggie's tragic suicide,

308
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,341
What do you think
should be done?

309
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,413
- I think we should
stay the course.

310
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:39,016
That is, if you want.

311
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,452
- Now, if I remember correctly,

312
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:44,455
Dr. Goodweather worked
under you at the cdc,

313
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:47,691
Did he not?
- Goodweather went rogue.

314
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:49,627
I told him to lay off.

315
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:53,564
I got him fired.
I had him arrested by the fbi.

316
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:55,866
I did everything I could do
to stop him.

317
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,808
- I think we'll keep him.

318
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:13,451
- Hey, zach.

319
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,953
Turn that off?

320
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,556
- What's up?

321
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,559
- We're leaving.

322
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:24,495
All of us, including you.

323
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:27,131
- Son, this is for you.

324
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,334
It is very sharp,
very dangerous.

325
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,837
Handle it with great care.

326
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,283
- This weapon
is forged from silver.

327
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:48,752
Silver burns vampires.

328
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:52,690
That's right,
you hold it with two hands.

329
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:55,659
Grip it tightly.

330
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:02,299
You want to show it
to them first.

331
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:06,270
They fear silver.

332
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:16,013
(voice breaking): Strike here,
if you can reach.

333
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:19,783
If you can't,

334
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,853
Strike here.
- Where there is no bone.

335
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,822
The blade goes deeper.

336
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:28,692
Quick thrusts: In and out,
in, out.

337
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,406
- You know why we're doing this?
- Yeah.

338
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,877
- Since the beginning
of creation,

339
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,879
Boys have hunted
beside their fathers.

340
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,751
This is no different.
- This is very different.

341
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:56,654
We're fighting
to protect each other.

342
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:59,423
We're going
to get through this.

343
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,725
And we're going to win.

344
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,752
- Remember, he will use whatever
advantage he can against us.

345
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,255
Whatever you see,

346
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,724
Whatever you hear,

347
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:37,161
Do not stop until
the master is defeated.

348
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:45,769
(door clanking)

349
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,041
(door creaking open)

350
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,961
- Ready?

351
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,997
(door opening)

352
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:17,201
(vampires growling)

353
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,742
I knew it!

354
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:29,146
Nice, huh?
(sizzling)

355
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,282
- They won't hold.

356
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:36,353
Now they've seen us, they'll
push through, sacrificing

357
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,856
However many it takes so
the others can get through.

358
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:40,924
- (fet): Remember when I, uh,

359
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:44,461
Went back to my place
that one time?

360
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:48,165
I grabbed a few things.
I've been saving these babies.

361
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,468
- Is that...
- dynamite, yes.

362
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,805
It's, uh, a common
exterminating tool.

363
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,607
- You flatter me, doc.

364
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:59,009
You guys might want
to get back in the tunnel.

365
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:02,846
Munchers are
going boom-boom.

366
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,550
Fire in the hole, vermin!

367
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:10,921
(growling and screeching)

368
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,359
(loud explosions)

369
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,309
Good. Come on,

370
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,712
We're good!

371
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:38,282
Cover your nose.
Ammonia overload.

372
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,656
(vampires snarling)

373
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,707
- (the master): <i>Woodcarver...</i>

374
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:07,911
- You're hearing him,
aren't you?

375
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,251
- Now it's his turn to hear me!

376
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,856
Let's finish this.

377
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:28,432
Spread out and attack!

378
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,201
(yelling)
(firing)

379
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,279
- Dutch!
- No, wait!

380
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,082
It's jaimie.

381
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:48,652
She works at
a gallery in soho.

382
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:52,289
(whispering): Oh, god!
(snarling)

383
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,658
Bloody hell!

384
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,362
Ahh!
(screeching)

385
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:12,576
- Keep moving!
- Go find him, professor!

386
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:14,778
You too, doc.

387
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,147
We'll handle these munchers.

388
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,949
Now, aim for the head!

389
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:21,018
- Like that!
- Dad!

390
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,087
- I got you, zach. Come on!
- That a girl.

391
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,829
(snarling)
- (zach): Dad!

392
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:34,765
- (eph): Zach!

393
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,282
- (abraham): Clear this level.

394
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,590
- (fet): Incoming!

395
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,794
(gun clicking)
shit!

396
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,167
- Ms. Velders!

397
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:13,303
So I'll drink you first.
- Yeah, try it, asshole!

398
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,441
(screaming)

399
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:32,556
(screeching)

400
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,951
(whispering voices)

401
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:04,621
- (miriam): <i>Abraham...</i>
<i>Abraham, come to me!</i>

402
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,024
<i>Abraham, I'm here!</i>

403
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:14,498
<i>Abraham, come to me, please...</i>

404
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,904
<i>Come to me!</i>

405
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:23,206
<i>Abraham!</i>

406
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:29,079
(thudding)
(snarling)

407
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:32,449
- You wanted to find me,
woodcarver?

408
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:40,123
Here I am.

409
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,067
- I have waited for this day.

410
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,207
- (eph): Break the windows,
let in the light!

411
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:03,480
(groaning)

412
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,840
(groaning)

413
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,944
- It's over, <i>strigoi!</i>

414
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:45,288
(sizzling)

415
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,528
(eph yelling)

416
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,137
- Come on!

417
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:13,950
- (master): <i>Come to me!</i>

418
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,535
(roaring)

419
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:35,305
- In the name of all
that is holy!

420
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,846
(screeching)

421
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,885
- Where is he?

422
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,357
- He ran down the building
and disappeared.

423
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:32,629
- (fet): In direct sunlight?
- In direct sunlight.

424
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:36,733
- I thought that
couldn't happen.

425
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,139
I thought sunlight
would kill him!

426
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:45,475
- What he did, I...

427
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:49,513
Did not know
he was capable of doing.

428
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:51,615
- But you injured him, right?
I mean,

429
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:55,585
That's why the others ran off?
- I was wrong.

430
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,700
- Well, if sunlight doesn't
kill him, what does?

431
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,108
- We're lost.

432
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,298
(grunting)

433
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,871
- Don't do that again.

434
00:36:56,981 --> 00:37:00,150
- What is this? I've seen you
kill other vampires,

435
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:03,587
And I know you've got a sting or
two. What do you want with me?

436
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:07,724
- You work for the german.
- I don't work for nobody.

437
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,826
I did a job
for him once

438
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:12,562
And I regret it.
- You transported a box

439
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,865
From the airport, across
the river, into manhattan.

440
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:18,835
- Yeah, and I
owe him for that.

441
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,907
He's number one on my list.

442
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,077
- Do you know what
was in the box?

443
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,046
- Whatever it was,
it cost me my mother.

444
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:34,084
It cost me my best friend.

445
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:36,052
It cost me everything.

446
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:39,756
- Maybe you would like
some revenge?

447
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:44,060
- Well, you know what?

448
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,997
Now that you mention it...

449
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,439
(running feet)

450
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,699
Oh, what's up?
You brought your homeboys?

451
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:32,375
(soft growling)

452
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,589
Holy shit!

453
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:56,933
- You are standing before
beings of great honor,

454
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,636
Dignity, power.

455
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:01,938
The ancients.

456
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:09,846
- Are they alive?
- In a way.

457
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:13,850
- I mean, can't they speak?
- I speak for them...

458
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,285
For now.

459
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,123
- Well, why is he
looking at me like that?

460
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:22,058
- They're not looking at you.

461
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,527
They're dreaming.

462
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,664
If we wake them,
we'll have to feed them.

463
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,733
I don't think
you'd enjoy that.

464
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:33,136
An ancient truce
has been broken.

465
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:35,739
An act of war
has been declared.

466
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:38,341
We need a human soldier,

467
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:41,077
Who can move freely
in the daylight.

468
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:43,913
Someone who can use
the power of the sun

469
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:46,816
To massacre the unclean.

470
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:50,487
- You know what it
sounds like to me?

471
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:53,523
Sounds like you got a vampire
turf war going on.

472
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:57,394
- You have proven
yourself capable.

473
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,362
- Why should I help them?

474
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:02,866
...Or you?
- Payback.

475
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:05,502
And a rich payday.

476
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:12,709
- I'm listening.

477
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:15,678
- We'll go to my place
to regroup.

478
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,081
I have tools.

479
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,450
(hyperventilating)

480
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:24,320
- Zach, where's your inhaler?

481
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,532
(dog barking)

482
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:41,204
- The extra inhalers
are in there.

483
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:45,208
Wait two minutes.
- Make it one, doc.

484
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,581
- Okay, zach, I got it.
Come here. Come on!

485
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:34,357
- You're not wheezing.
- You said we were

486
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:36,159
Never coming back.

487
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,096
- Did you do this just
to get this photo album?

488
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,535
- It's dangerous here.

489
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:47,470
- Where are we going?

490
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:49,539
- Right now,
we're going to fet's.

491
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:52,575
- How will mom find us?

492
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:01,351
- She'll find us.

493
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:07,690
I remember
that birthday party.

494
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,127
We had that... That pony.

495
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:18,635
And mom made that farm cake.
- Yeah, that was awesome.

496
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:21,538
- I'm surprised
she kept all this.

497
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,573
- She wouldn't just trash
all these pictures

498
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:26,042
Just because you two split up.

499
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,214
- Okay. Time to go.

500
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,583
(kissing zach)

501
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,843
(growling)

502
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,623
<i>- Zach...</i>

503
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:16,225
- No.

504
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:19,262
- Mom!
<i>- Zach...</i>

505
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,231
<i>Zach...
- Mom!</i>

506
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:25,868
- No. It's not her!
- Mom! Let me go!

507
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:29,939
- Stop it. Stop it, zach!
- No, mom!

508
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,842
No, don't shoot her!
- It's not her anymore!

509
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:38,281
- (zach): No!

510
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,119
Mom!

511
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:46,556
Mom!

512
00:43:46,558 --> 00:43:49,158
(whispering voices)

513
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,895
(crying): Mom...

514
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,470
- She was here?

515
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,672
- Why aren't there
any more coming?

516
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:05,775
- There will be. She won't stop.

517
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:09,812
Not until she gets
what she wants.

518
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,782
The master will use your wife,

519
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:15,752
Her love
for your boy.

520
00:44:15,754 --> 00:44:17,620
- Eph... Don't.

521
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:19,689
- (abraham): He'll use
your wife's love

522
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:21,824
For her son to pursue us.

523
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:26,095
To the ends of the earth,
if necessary.

524
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:43,246
- Let him try.

525
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,951
- (abraham): <i>Too long</i>
<i>I've lived,</i>

526
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:52,188
<i>Too much I've seen.</i>

527
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,857
<i>This planet, our host,</i>

528
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:59,028
<i>Once so wild and unknown;</i>

529
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,798
<i>We've mapped it, paved it,</i>

530
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,667
<i>Arranged it on a grid,</i>

531
00:45:04,669 --> 00:45:07,303
<i>Never imagining</i>

532
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:09,906
<i>That something else
was watching us,</i>

533
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:12,709
<i>A creature even more
ruthless and predacious</i>

534
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:14,911
<i>Than we are,</i>

535
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:17,747
<i>Eager to exploit
the very infrastructure</i>

536
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:20,550
<i>We so obligingly arranged.</i>

537
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:26,222
<i>Is the war already lost?</i>

538
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,592
<i>Are we destined to be
cattle for monsters?</i>

539
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:34,330
<i>Or, now that the enemy
has finally shown his face,</i>

540
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:38,234
<i>Do we have a fighting chance?</i>

541
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:46,409
<i>The world today is not
what it was one week ago.</i>

542
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:49,512
<i>What will it be
one week from now?</i>

543
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:51,447
<i>One month from now?</i>

544
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:54,851
<i>Nothing is written
that cannot be changed.</i>

545
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:57,286
It is a small world, after all.

546
00:45:57,288 --> 00:46:00,189
<i>We made it that way.</i>

547
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,927
(sirens)

547
00:46:05,305 --> 00:47:05,689

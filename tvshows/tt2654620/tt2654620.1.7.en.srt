1
00:00:00,238 --> 00:00:01,846
Previously on The Strain...

2
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:04,722
You've grown old, A230385.

3
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:07,917
It has been many years,
you look exactly the same.

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:10,698
We're organizing you all for assignments

5
00:00:10,728 --> 00:00:12,593
- to porters and johns.
- Skills?

6
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:14,830
- We are carpenters.
- This scourge

7
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:16,634
we're now witnessing has existed

8
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:18,858
for millennia. Ravages what is human

9
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:20,443
and instills a raging thirst.

10
00:00:20,473 --> 00:00:22,495
Are you saying this
epidemic was intentional?

11
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:23,854
That somebody planned this?
Is  that what you are saying?

12
00:00:23,884 --> 00:00:25,441
I don't know! They paid
me a little bit of money

13
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:27,895
to do 'em a favor, alright? Then the
favors kept getting bigger an bigger.

14
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:30,877
- And you waited now to tell us!
- You might not understand this, Eph,

15
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:33,637
but I would do anything
to keep my wife alive.

16
00:00:35,444 --> 00:00:37,946
No, Gusto! Gusto! Help!

17
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:43,462
What is that shit? Bro, get it out!

18
00:00:43,758 --> 00:00:46,649
Those we hold dear, if they are turned,

19
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,683
they come back home and destroy those

20
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:50,988
- they love the most.
- Where are we going?

21
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:52,663
Mama needs some rest,

22
00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:54,762
so we are going on an adventure.

23
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:59,456
You're both ready. Good. I have a new plan.

25
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:25,124
Would you like me to
carry it for you, Mr. Luss?

26
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,500
No. There should be somebody here.

27
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,830
- I got it. Thanks.
- Yeah.

28
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:48,940
Communications companies across the country

29
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:51,345
have been unable to
avert the dramatic failure

30
00:01:51,346 --> 00:01:53,826
of cell phone and Internet
communications, which began

31
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:56,122
late yesterday. The fringe hacker group

32
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:59,228
Citizens for Liberty claims
responsibility for the slowdown

33
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,454
which has paralyzed some
of wall street's major

34
00:02:01,484 --> 00:02:04,052
financial institutions.
The tragedy has already

35
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,144
generated a class-action
lawsuit filed Tuesday.

36
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:08,752
Attorney Joan Luss told reporters

37
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:13,261
at a press conference that 173
of the Regis passenger families

38
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,230
had joined in the legal action.

39
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,302
Over 200 people were killed on that flight.

40
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:22,575
Regis Air and the CEO bares...

41
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:26,449
Go, get 'em, girl.

42
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:29,198
- Neeva.
- Merci, bon Dieu, I reach you.

43
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:31,795
25 times I called you before I get through.

44
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:36,089
You must come home. Your wife isn't well.

45
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,575
There's something very wrong with her and

46
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:41,460
- she doesn't even know it. I...
- Whoa! Just slow down. What?

47
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,557
- I took the children.
- Took them where?

48
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:47,421
- My home.
- On my way from the airport.

49
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,335
I'll be at the house in 20 minutes.

50
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:52,454
- Just bring the kids back there.
- No, I cannot.

51
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:55,142
I've been on a plane for
19 hours. I'm not making

52
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:57,382
a side trip to yonkers tonight.

53
00:02:57,895 --> 00:02:59,757
They are already asleep.

54
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:02,092
Fine. In the morning.

55
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:06,065
First thing in the morning,
bring them to the house.

56
00:03:08,942 --> 00:03:10,643
Call Joan Luss home.

57
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:12,596
Cell service unavailable.

58
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,044
Connect to the Internet.

59
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:45,211
Neighborhood's a little deserted.

60
00:03:45,212 --> 00:03:48,118
Any idea what's going on?
They say it's from eclipse.

61
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:51,483
- How's that?
- $8.30.

62
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:59,846
Credit machine not
working tonight. Cash only.

63
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:03,950
Got to run inside and get cash.

64
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:06,198
I'll be right back.

65
00:04:14,452 --> 00:04:15,665
Oh!

66
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:21,502
Franco?

67
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,331
What the!?

68
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:30,795
Go, go, go! Just start the car! Go!

69
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:32,829
Move! Drive!

70
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:34,935
- Lock the doors! Drive the car!
- What are you doing!?

71
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:36,166
Drive the car!

72
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,392
Jesus Christ!

73
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:40,124
- Drive the car!
- What is this, man?!

74
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,050
Drive the goddamn car! Go!

75
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,052
No, don't! Ah! Ah! Holy shit!

76
00:04:45,297 --> 00:04:47,813
- What is this, man?!
- Go! Go!

77
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:49,460
- Oh!
- Oh, Jesus!

78
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:54,161
What are you doing?

79
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:56,548
Ah! What the shit!

80
00:04:58,285 --> 00:04:59,537
Ah!

81
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:11,911
Joan!

82
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:13,844
Joan, you got to call the cops!

83
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:15,882
Joan, honey, where are you?

84
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,588
Joan!

85
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:22,154
Come on, come on. Oh! Oh, thank God!

86
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:24,765
Services have been suspended for this area.

87
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:27,248
We value you as a customer
and hope to reestablish

88
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:28,738
service as soon as possible.

89
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:31,173
- This is a recording.
- Oh, my God!

91
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:55,639
Authorities just announced the
Brooklyn Bridge has been closed...

92
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,156
Silver bullets?

93
00:05:57,186 --> 00:06:00,495
They are susceptible to
silver, it burns them.

94
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:02,885
- I cast these bullets myself.
- OK.

95
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:04,716
I learned the legend of this creature

96
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:07,757
from my Bubbeh, my grandmother,
when I was 8 years old.

97
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:10,517
She's the one who told
me silver could harm them.

98
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:13,518
I have since verified this many times.

99
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:17,929
Silver is known to interfere
with sulfur bonds in bacteria.

100
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:20,887
- I suggest you fill up a gun.
- Look, before we do

101
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:23,205
any more killing, and especially
because I think it's clear

102
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:26,415
we can't stop this thing one
by one, I've got a better idea.

103
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:29,212
We've got video. We've got
ample proof to show people.

104
00:06:29,242 --> 00:06:31,998
Let's get this in front of the public,
let' s get it in front of everybody.

105
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:34,226
That will not work.

106
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,434
Whoever is behind this
has eliminated that option

107
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,894
with much calculation and to great expense.

108
00:06:39,924 --> 00:06:42,766
Oh, but your theory that you
pitched yesterday, that we kill

109
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:45,692
the leader of these vampires,
that's far more logical.

110
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:48,703
It's far more likely to
work. We kill the Master,

111
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:51,045
and its spawn will die. I promise you.

112
00:06:51,046 --> 00:06:53,917
OK, for convenience sake and
strictly as a semantic term,

113
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:55,556
we'll refer to him as "the Master".

114
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:57,946
You're saying we kill the
master and that's somehow

115
00:06:57,976 --> 00:07:00,376
- gonna stop this plague.
- Yeah.

116
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:02,389
That makes no biological sense!

117
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:04,456
You destroy one creature, and somehow

118
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,260
all the other ones die? How does that work?

119
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,642
I have verified the
observations of these authors

120
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:11,525
with my own experience.
Those that are inaccurate,

121
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:15,595
I have discarded. That is
your scientific method, no?

122
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:18,807
If you wish to defeat this
evil, you must trust me.

123
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:21,975
I understand this! You do not!

124
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,936
Aliens have infiltrated the highest levels

125
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:26,873
- of our government...
- Thanks, Howard.

126
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:28,408
At every turn, everything I have said

127
00:07:28,438 --> 00:07:30,543
has proven to be correct. Is that not true?

128
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:33,069
- Yes, but...
- This is no different.

129
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,269
Logic is not the issue here...

130
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,344
It's your desire to always be in control.

131
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,179
Alright, alright, if we were to do this,

132
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,468
ho... how do we find this Master?

133
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:45,097
Well, that is our first problem.

134
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:47,278
His nesting place will be well hidden.

135
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:49,448
We need to locate his human helpers.

136
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,042
What about Jim?

137
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,640
Those people hired Jim

138
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,401
to smuggle the coffin out of the airport.

139
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,070
- Jim? Who's Jim?
- He's the guy who betrayed me.

140
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,259
- I'm not going back there.
- We're running out of other options.

141
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:03,894
Please, Ephrem,

142
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:06,784
trust me.

143
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,514
We will prevail.

144
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:53,135
Achtung!

145
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,162
In line! Now!

146
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:07,344
Gentlemen... while you have been

147
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:10,598
contributing so diligently
to the war effort,

148
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,936
we conducted an inspection of your barracks

149
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:16,031
and made a surprising discovery.

150
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:20,285
A Jewish talisman.

151
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:26,771
I believe you people refer
to it as the Hand of Miriam.

152
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:33,776
We found it secured
beneath one of your bunks.

153
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,305
It appears to have been carved from the

154
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,732
very oak you work with in this shop.

155
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:41,966
Oak that is property of the Third Reich.

156
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,723
Now, who is responsible

157
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:51,865
for this fine piece of craftsmanship?

158
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:56,021
No one wishes to claim credit?

159
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,370
Very well.

160
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,958
I will shoot you one at a time

161
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:25,898
until the perpetrator steps forward.

162
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,847
I made it.

163
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,906
Where did you learn to carve like this?

164
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:43,845
My father.

165
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:46,395
Show me your hands.

166
00:10:53,382 --> 00:10:55,446
Yes.

167
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:05,426
"A230385."

168
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:11,851
Please... come with me.

169
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:14,151
If I recall correctly,

170
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:17,314
this totem is named after
the sister of Moses and Aaron

171
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,998
and is supposed to offer
protection from evil.

172
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:29,583
I have a special project for you.

173
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:47,653
Lots of detail work.

174
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:49,891
That shouldn't be difficult for you.

175
00:11:50,284 --> 00:11:52,997
You're excused from regular duties.

176
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,806
This will be your sole focus.

177
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:06,571
: Any contraband between your toes?

178
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,464
Let me see. Wiggle 'em for me.

179
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:11,424
- You know what I'm saying, bro?
- I'm not your bro.

180
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:14,379
- It was self-defense!
- Other foot, please.

181
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:16,352
Up! Toes.

182
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:17,880
You see that fat dude's body?

183
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,665
Do I look like a coroner to you? Arms up.

184
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:22,797
He had a 6-foot frog tongue!

185
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:25,753
He bled white! He had worms in his blood!

186
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:28,571
Sir, you need to chill out.

187
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:30,767
Get the light out of my face, man.

188
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:32,545
In a couple of hours, you'll come down off

189
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:34,015
of whatever shit you
took, but in the meantime,

190
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,879
you need to follow my instructions.

191
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:37,453
Now bend forward and expose your buttocks.

192
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:41,131
I didn't take nothing. I don't do drugs.

193
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:44,232
You better tell your bosses
there's some weird shit

194
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:47,295
- going down out there.
- This is New York City,

195
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:50,583
weird shit goes down
out there all the time.

196
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:01,707
- What did I forget?
- Your phone charger.

197
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:11,515
Alright, well, we better get going.

198
00:13:11,545 --> 00:13:13,429
Our flight doesn't leave for 4 hours.

199
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,892
Yeah, well, with
everything that's going on,

200
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:18,027
traffic is going to be a nightmare.

201
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,116
- Something wrong?
- You tell me.

202
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:25,359
You can't sit still. You
keep looking out the window.

203
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,892
- Don't want to miss the flight.
- Why?

204
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:30,349
You say this is the
most deadly outbreak ever

205
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:34,144
and suddenly you want to
run off to Palo Alto with me?

206
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:35,252
That's not you.

207
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:36,959
This is different.

208
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:39,312
This is about your health. It's about us.

209
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:40,516
I know when you're lying to me,

210
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:42,804
you always fiddle with your glasses.

211
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:44,742
Could we just talk about
this when we get there?

212
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:47,366
No. We're talking now.

213
00:13:47,655 --> 00:13:49,103
Why did Barnes sideline you?

214
00:13:49,104 --> 00:13:51,607
He sidelined all of us. He
doesn't want to acknowledge

215
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:53,159
what's going on.

216
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:54,770
- Eph...
- No, it's...

217
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,612
You helped him do whatever
got him into trouble.

218
00:13:56,642 --> 00:13:58,665
It's not Eph's fault. It's me.

219
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:00,478
- I don't understand.
- I know.

220
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:04,512
Jim, it's Eph!

221
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:13,763
I thought the FBI had you.

222
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:15,725
It did. Let us in.

223
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:20,895
- Sylvia, please.
- Let them though.

224
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:27,359
What don't you understand, Sylvia?
Your husband accepted bribes

225
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:29,780
and because of that, an
epidemic is now tearing

226
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,804
- its way through the city.
- Sylvie...

227
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:34,999
I was involved in a major way.

228
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:39,304
- Look...
- No, you're not actually

229
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:40,719
thinking of doing this.

230
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,026
I cannot believe that you are gonna let

231
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,549
this self-righteous prick
manipulate you with crazy talk

232
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,551
- about vampires!
- No, I... I saw one.

233
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:58,092
- It attacked me.
- I'm not listening

234
00:14:58,122 --> 00:14:59,859
to any more of this.

235
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:04,898
You need to decide what you're going
to do... and who matters to you.

236
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:07,217
I have to help them.

237
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:12,912
I will get him. Great.

238
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,135
Where are you going?

239
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,798
To call a cab. I'm leaving!

240
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:19,774
You do what you want, I will too!

241
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:23,630
Jim, I need you to describe the German.

242
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,291
He was about 45,

243
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:32,332
blond, hair graying, maybe a toupee.

244
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:35,125
Really waxy skin.

245
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:39,346
And his eyes were intense.

246
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:41,318
He was well dressed.

247
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:45,026
Thomas Eichhorst.

248
00:15:48,477 --> 00:15:50,300
Give me a minute.

249
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,439
Let him talk to her.

250
00:16:01,803 --> 00:16:05,444
What's your history with this German?

251
00:16:05,474 --> 00:16:09,242
It's long... complicated.

252
00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:12,014
He's a strigoi.

253
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:13,965
When I first met him many years ago,

254
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:17,025
he was still human, yet...

255
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,062
Just as monstrous.

256
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,042
A230385.

257
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,378
How is it progressing?

258
00:16:38,742 --> 00:16:41,141
Very well, Herr Standartenfֳ¼hrer.

259
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:52,932
Your father taught you well.

260
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,717
Does it bring you enjoyment?

261
00:17:02,983 --> 00:17:06,393
It takes my mind off this place.

262
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:11,459
In that sense I suppose, it's...

263
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:12,796
Pleasurable.

264
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:26,811
I've never been good with my hands.

265
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:30,510
Cannot draw or sculpt or carve anything.

266
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,185
Want to know how pathetic I am?

267
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:38,681
In middle-school
woodworking, I had to steal

268
00:17:38,711 --> 00:17:42,303
another boy's project to pass the class.

269
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,834
How sad is that?

270
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:49,214
We all have different talents.

271
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:53,285
I'm sure you did not rise to your...

272
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:58,132
Position through sheer luck.

273
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,974
Quite right.

274
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:12,496
Managing people, that's my talent.

275
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:18,046
Picking the right person for the right job.

276
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:21,858
Just as I did with you on this project.

277
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:24,643
And God, I was right.

278
00:18:24,673 --> 00:18:27,361
Look at that craftsmanship.

279
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:45,128
Wish I had more like you.

280
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:11,415
Bonjour, Audrey.

281
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:13,063
Sleep well?

282
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:14,135
No.

283
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:16,292
Neeva, can we please go home?

284
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:22,034
Good question, mom. You told her
father you'd have them back by now.

285
00:19:22,064 --> 00:19:24,774
Go get your brother and we talk about it.

286
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:30,321
What do you mean, "talk about it"?

287
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:33,407
Christ, mother, you are their employee,

288
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:37,517
- not part of their family.
- There is danger in that house.

289
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:39,188
Audrey, Keene, get your coats on.

290
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:41,827
- No, you can't!
- Don't argue with me about it.

291
00:19:41,857 --> 00:19:45,319
We're taking them back.

292
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:50,648
OK.

293
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:53,598
But if it is as I say,

294
00:19:53,628 --> 00:19:56,150
if she is sick,

295
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,123
we will take the children away from there.

296
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:00,427
I'm a nurse, mom, if Mrs. Luss is sick,

297
00:20:00,457 --> 00:20:02,880
I'll know what to do.

298
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,587
Kids, get your coats on.

299
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:07,197
Vite, s'il vous plait.

300
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:20,234
Dr. Moise said one of the
side effects of corticosteroids

301
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:23,747
is weight gain. In your case,
that could be a good thing.

302
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:27,211
You haven't a comment on
the elephant in the room?

303
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:29,764
What happens if his drug cocktail fails

304
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:31,487
and my body rejects the liver?

305
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:35,823
Sir, I don't think it's productive
for you to think about that.

306
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:38,462
In a few days, I'm sure
we'll look back on this as

307
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,650
a small bump in the road to your recovery.

308
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,972
I am most gratified to hear that.

309
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,940
We're all terribly fond of Eldritch.

310
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,862
Oh, Eichhorst,

311
00:20:50,892 --> 00:20:54,661
I'm not aware that we're
on a first name basis.

312
00:20:58,348 --> 00:21:00,652
I'll be right outside.

313
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:07,742
Your manservant has developed

314
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:09,491
misgivings about the relationship.

315
00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:11,996
He's a keen judge of character

316
00:21:11,997 --> 00:21:13,829
and very protective.

317
00:21:15,428 --> 00:21:17,039
Understandably.

318
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,180
He's been with me since his birth.

319
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:24,181
His parents worked for
my mother and father.

320
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:27,730
It's disappointing that it's
no longer a common practice.

321
00:21:28,644 --> 00:21:30,964
I assumed you've informed your Master

322
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:34,786
that the plan I've constructed
is unfolding perfectly.

323
00:21:34,816 --> 00:21:38,830
Everyone is focused on the
Citizen for Liberty cyber attacks.

324
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:42,479
And only a small wrinkle:

325
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:46,736
I've just received a
disturbing voice-mail.

326
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,522
This is Jim Kent.

327
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:53,252
Look, I didn't destroy Redfern's body.

328
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:56,919
I want you to have the
German bring $100,000 cash

329
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:59,427
to Grand Central at 3:30 this afternoon,

330
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:01,242
the Vanderbilt entrance.

331
00:22:01,272 --> 00:22:04,225
I get the money, you get Redfern's body.

332
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:06,358
And I'm never to be heard from again.

333
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,131
You assured me that you had

334
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:11,034
- this fellow under control.
- It's a bluff.

335
00:22:11,035 --> 00:22:13,018
Kent would never have
the courage to try this

336
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:16,145
on his own. The Jew is behind it.

337
00:22:16,146 --> 00:22:18,616
I thought you were going to deal with him.

338
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:21,122
He has more tenacity than I thought.

339
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:22,607
Well...

340
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,279
I hope it won't be a problem.

341
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:28,804
No problem. I'll take care of it.

342
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,905
Wunderbar.

343
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:06,937
Felix!

344
00:23:09,984 --> 00:23:12,037
Make room.

345
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:17,608
Alright?

346
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:21,180
I got you, let's go.

347
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,880
I got you.

348
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,743
It's alright. Yo, make room!

349
00:23:27,148 --> 00:23:29,030
First come, first serve.

350
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:32,639
Put him back on the floor where he belongs.

351
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,168
Get your bitch ass off the bench!

352
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:46,670
Relax, alright?

353
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,248
Real easy.

354
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:54,583
We're being punished for what we did.

355
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,721
Stop talking crazy, man.

356
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,595
Rest easy, OK?

357
00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:02,503
I'm gonna get us some help.

358
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,461
We're gonna get out of this, huh?

359
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,240
Just relax.

360
00:24:06,698 --> 00:24:09,017
You're gonna be alright.

361
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:11,150
Yo, C.O.!

362
00:24:11,472 --> 00:24:13,154
C.O.!

363
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,193
My friend needs some help, man. He's sick.

364
00:24:16,494 --> 00:24:18,770
A paramedic will come see him.

365
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:20,904
When?

366
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:24,265
When?!

367
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:26,427
When he has time. Now, shut up

368
00:24:26,457 --> 00:24:27,817
or you'll be needing him too.

369
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,097
- Look, Sylvia, I'm...
- No, don't bother.

370
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:37,580
Look, I'm sorry I lied.

371
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:40,622
Alright? I was only trying to protect you.

372
00:24:40,652 --> 00:24:42,832
Jesus. Let's go.

373
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,053
Goddamnit!

374
00:24:54,737 --> 00:24:58,297
- She'll come around.
- Will she?

375
00:24:58,822 --> 00:25:01,303
Look, I'm all in with you guys.

376
00:25:01,304 --> 00:25:03,568
Let's hope this works and
the German guy shows up.

377
00:25:03,598 --> 00:25:06,113
He has too much hubris. Once challenged,

378
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:08,986
he will show. You'll need this.

379
00:25:11,315 --> 00:25:14,024
I was sort of hoping for
something in the gun family.

380
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,335
Silver is more effective.

381
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:07,493
You must pick up the pace,

382
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:11,728
A230385.

383
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,697
I'm assuming the urgency

384
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:17,944
is from that Russian artillery?

385
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:20,315
It will get finished.

386
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,887
I admire your work ethic.

387
00:26:23,461 --> 00:26:25,664
Where I grew up, everyone worked hard.

388
00:26:26,447 --> 00:26:28,253
We knew no other way.

389
00:26:28,518 --> 00:26:30,408
Where do you come from?

390
00:26:31,435 --> 00:26:33,943
- I was born in Armenia.
- Uh.

391
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:36,181
After the great war, my family settled

392
00:26:36,182 --> 00:26:38,820
in a little town in Romania.

393
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,626
- Varsolt.
- Varsolt.

394
00:26:42,202 --> 00:26:44,899
Of course!

395
00:26:45,408 --> 00:26:47,305
I travelled through there!

396
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:51,879
Summer...

397
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,851
'41!

398
00:26:56,035 --> 00:26:59,229
Has a beautifully preserved Roman castle.

399
00:27:06,318 --> 00:27:07,720
Oh.

400
00:27:08,644 --> 00:27:10,618
Went through the hands

401
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:12,957
of many great empires:

402
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:15,557
The romans...

403
00:27:15,587 --> 00:27:18,334
Mongols, Habsburgs,

404
00:27:18,335 --> 00:27:20,873
the Germans.

405
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:29,164
So, tell me,

406
00:27:29,811 --> 00:27:32,689
A230385...

407
00:27:33,633 --> 00:27:38,103
Do you think we Germans will
outlast our predecessors?

408
00:27:41,456 --> 00:27:43,133
Please.

409
00:27:44,201 --> 00:27:46,286
Speak freely.

410
00:27:47,603 --> 00:27:49,261
Ha! Ha!

411
00:27:54,335 --> 00:27:56,948
I think the Third Reich
is in its death throes.

412
00:27:58,742 --> 00:28:00,822
Very likely.

413
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:08,103
But suppose...

414
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:11,243
A new Reich rose from the ashes of this one

415
00:28:11,244 --> 00:28:14,027
led by a new fֳ¼hrer,

416
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:15,912
who's able to deliver

417
00:28:15,942 --> 00:28:18,425
everything Hitler promised and more.

418
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:21,287
I think that would be a
very sad day for humanity.

419
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:23,043
Quite the opposite, my friend.

420
00:28:23,073 --> 00:28:24,904
It's what humanity craves:

421
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:26,741
a strong leader,

422
00:28:26,742 --> 00:28:28,779
- a visionary...
- Visionary?

423
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,616
Hitler is a megalomaniac who
declared himself dictator.

424
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:35,585
Wrong! Hitler was elected democratically!

425
00:28:35,615 --> 00:28:38,089
He went before the Reichstag.

426
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,397
He asked the elected representatives

427
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,289
of the people to grant
him extraordinary powers!

428
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:46,374
And they did by an overwhelming majority!

429
00:28:46,404 --> 00:28:47,659
Because they were terrified.

430
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:51,339
Yes! Terrified of democracy!

431
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:53,050
They had lived through the chaos

432
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,050
of the Weimar Republic:

433
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,325
governments gridlocked
by parties and bickering!

434
00:28:59,355 --> 00:29:03,174
They realized Plato was right.

435
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:05,681
The republic can only be led

436
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:08,102
by a philosopher king

437
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:10,459
with the wisdom

438
00:29:10,489 --> 00:29:12,840
to look after the needs of the many.

439
00:29:15,382 --> 00:29:18,079
- Unless you are a Jew.
- Ah...

440
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:20,362
You see? This is the problem.

441
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:22,822
You take all of this too personally.

442
00:29:22,823 --> 00:29:25,794
After the murder of my
family, I suppose I do.

443
00:29:25,824 --> 00:29:29,236
Oh, the nobility of the victim!

444
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:32,075
I see.

445
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:34,881
You comfort yourself with the fantasy

446
00:29:34,882 --> 00:29:38,662
that you're morally superior
to me, but you're not.

447
00:29:38,692 --> 00:29:40,468
First day you arrived,

448
00:29:40,498 --> 00:29:42,296
I asked if anyone was a carpenter,

449
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:44,902
and you eagerly threw up your hands!

450
00:29:44,903 --> 00:29:47,182
And from that day on, you've labored here,

451
00:29:47,212 --> 00:29:49,124
working on behalf of the Third Reich!

452
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,983
- I had no choice!
- Yes, you have!

453
00:29:53,347 --> 00:29:56,124
But you're afraid of the choice.

454
00:29:57,113 --> 00:29:58,864
The alternative.

455
00:30:05,862 --> 00:30:06,881
Here.

456
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,396
Let me make it clearer to you.

457
00:30:34,547 --> 00:30:37,882
If you're quick enough,
you might grab my pistol.

458
00:30:38,728 --> 00:30:39,914
You're going to die anyway

459
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:41,919
when the trains stop.

460
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,665
Why not go down fighting?

461
00:30:44,695 --> 00:30:46,641
Right here, right now?

462
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:49,347
Don't you want to try?

463
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,944
It's much easier to do nothing, isn't it?

464
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:12,373
Safer.

465
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:29,643
If that God you believe in really existed,

466
00:31:30,478 --> 00:31:33,191
what do you suppose he would think of you?

467
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:53,209
See? Look.

468
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:55,640
I told you, something evil happened here.

469
00:31:56,276 --> 00:31:58,246
Call the police.

470
00:31:58,276 --> 00:32:00,880
No! No! Keene, no, no!

471
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:02,918
Wait! Come back here!

472
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,926
No! Oh! Wait! Come back! Keene! Audrey!

473
00:32:07,215 --> 00:32:08,674
Haֵ¡, enfants!

474
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,235
- Mommy, where are you?
- Mama, are you home?

475
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,241
- Disgusting.
- Mr. Luss?

476
00:32:14,449 --> 00:32:16,888
- Miss Joan!
- Someone's been sick.

477
00:32:16,918 --> 00:32:18,874
Audrey!

478
00:32:19,172 --> 00:32:20,181
Miss Joan?

479
00:32:21,134 --> 00:32:22,520
You, stay there!

480
00:32:30,628 --> 00:32:32,203
Mr. Luss.

481
00:32:35,945 --> 00:32:38,257
- Daddy!
- No!

482
00:32:38,564 --> 00:32:41,133
Sebastiane,

483
00:32:41,547 --> 00:32:43,123
we have to leave.

484
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:45,405
We can't. We've got to
take this man to a hospital.

485
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:47,735
No! We must go now!

486
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,787
- Oh, God!
- Mama?

487
00:32:54,774 --> 00:32:55,632
What is that thing?!

488
00:32:55,662 --> 00:32:57,659
C'est pas le temps! La sortie est laֲ !

489
00:32:57,689 --> 00:33:00,336
Sortez! Sortez! Sortez!

490
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:07,385
Neeva!

491
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:15,790
Ah! Ah! Ah!

492
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:17,848
Allez! Allez, allez!

493
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,544
What is it?

494
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:22,724
Open the door!

495
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:24,919
Neeva! Neeva! Neeva!

496
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,491
Vite! Vite!

497
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:31,000
Non! Non! Enfin! Par lֳ !

498
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:36,978
- Go quick!
- Help me with the table!

499
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,397
What's wrong with my momma?

500
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:48,001
An evil loa has possessed
her. He craves food.

501
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:55,588
What food?

502
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,523
Ah!

503
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,883
_

504
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:13,318
Right upstairs.

505
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:27,118
I'll call you when I get there.

506
00:34:31,745 --> 00:34:33,427
No luggage, Mr. Kent?

507
00:34:36,884 --> 00:34:38,278
And no Sylvia.

508
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:40,234
Won't she be joining you on your train?

509
00:34:40,264 --> 00:34:42,412
- Where's the money?
- Where's the Jew?

510
00:34:42,442 --> 00:34:44,549
What Jew?

511
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,756
He's here somewhere. I can smell him.

512
00:34:48,576 --> 00:34:49,422
And he's managed

513
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:52,031
to recruit you into his pathetic crusade.

514
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,942
You're now on the wrong
side of history, Jim Kent.

515
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:57,023
It's not too late.

516
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,415
You and your wife could still
be part of a glorious new order.

517
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:02,453
But make the wrong decision here

518
00:35:02,454 --> 00:35:05,425
and you condemn Sylvia to a
painful and lingering death.

519
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,393
I'll ask you one more time.

520
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:14,085
Where's the Jew?

521
00:35:14,115 --> 00:35:15,795
Christ, I have no idea.

522
00:35:15,825 --> 00:35:19,053
I could drink you right here.

523
00:35:19,054 --> 00:35:22,228
Turn you...

524
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,636
If you do anything... You
see those cops over there?

525
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:30,900
They'll be all over you.

526
00:35:37,899 --> 00:35:40,131
Well...

527
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:46,277
Then I guess you've made your decision.

528
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:50,385
Consider your wife dead.

529
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,853
This is Grand Central 47th Street.

530
00:36:23,854 --> 00:36:28,730
Transfer to Bedford, 6-7 at
Charlotte to Times Square.

531
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,402
Connection is available at Bedford.

532
00:36:31,403 --> 00:36:35,007
This is an east-transfer-bound
5 expressway.

533
00:36:35,037 --> 00:36:38,217
Next stop is 51st Street.

534
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:52,342
Ladies and gentlemen,

535
00:36:52,372 --> 00:36:55,419
we apologize for the unavoidable delay.

536
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:59,404
Eph!

537
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:22,240
Shit!

538
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:27,884
He lost us.

539
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:48,789
Jim.

540
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:52,268
Did you see where Eichhorst went?

541
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,729
No. Look, he knows it's a trap.

542
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:56,170
He's looking for Setrakian.

543
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,923
- Did you warn him?
- I didn't see him.

544
00:37:58,953 --> 00:38:00,752
Alright, we have to
find Setrakian. Come on!

545
00:38:00,753 --> 00:38:02,657
I saw him on the first level.

546
00:38:06,185 --> 00:38:09,014
:Train service between
74th Street-Broadway,

547
00:38:09,044 --> 00:38:11,137
and 11th Street-Roosevelt Avenue

548
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:13,365
has been reduced due to construction.

549
00:38:13,366 --> 00:38:16,209
We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.

550
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,752
For further information,

551
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:20,787
the information desk...

552
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:34,534
Ladies and gentlemen,

553
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:37,126
we apologize for the unavoidable delay.

554
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:47,763
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

555
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:49,708
Stand clear of the closing doors.

556
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,399
: Attention, passengers, the last stop

557
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,041
for Pelham Bay Park is
3rd Avenue-138 Street.

558
00:39:17,572 --> 00:39:20,603
A230385,

559
00:39:21,496 --> 00:39:24,876
you really thought I would lead you to him?

560
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,819
I warned you to stay in jail.

561
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:33,706
Fitting that

562
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:35,630
we should end our journey where it began...

563
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,947
- On a train platform.
- This time,

564
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,638
I'm the one with the weapon.

565
00:39:40,668 --> 00:39:43,510
Sardu's sword, the Master will be pleased

566
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,066
- to get it back.
- Then come and take it.

567
00:39:46,096 --> 00:39:49,633
And once again, you follow a false messiah

568
00:39:49,663 --> 00:39:51,009
who will prove as horrific

569
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:53,204
as the last one.

570
00:40:08,403 --> 00:40:09,739
Grrr!

571
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:19,016
I give you another day of life, Jew,

572
00:40:19,046 --> 00:40:21,295
for services rendered.

573
00:40:35,743 --> 00:40:37,417
Are you alright?

574
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:41,469
Seven-train service has been reduced

575
00:40:41,499 --> 00:40:44,342
between 74th Street-Broadway
and Queensboro Plaza.

576
00:40:49,526 --> 00:40:51,590
We have a new cook.

577
00:40:52,135 --> 00:40:55,331
Makes his own wurst. It's quite tasty.

578
00:40:56,185 --> 00:40:58,274
Go on, take it.

579
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:01,644
You earned it.

580
00:41:17,637 --> 00:41:20,450
You've included every detail.

581
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,361
It's magnificent.

582
00:41:34,498 --> 00:41:36,215
They're back.

583
00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:39,308
Benedicta tu in mulieribus.

584
00:41:40,054 --> 00:41:41,316
Tu in mulieribus.

585
00:41:41,346 --> 00:41:43,323
Benedicta fructus ventris.

586
00:41:43,787 --> 00:41:46,236
Oh, papa!

587
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:51,206
Bon Dieu, protיgez-nous.

588
00:41:57,244 --> 00:41:59,018
Mama.

589
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:20,291
Come to me.

590
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:41,073
Did they injure you?

591
00:42:41,554 --> 00:42:43,847
Non... no.

592
00:42:43,877 --> 00:42:47,005
Good.

593
00:42:48,203 --> 00:42:50,637
Bring the young ones to me.

594
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:03,598
Come over here.

595
00:43:05,636 --> 00:43:08,188
I want to have a look at you...

596
00:43:08,598 --> 00:43:11,303
Make sure you're OK.

597
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:13,725
Did they, uh, scare you?

598
00:43:13,755 --> 00:43:16,487
Huh? I bet they did.

599
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:17,456
Good.

600
00:43:17,457 --> 00:43:21,255
You look OK. Come here. How about you?

601
00:43:21,285 --> 00:43:23,720
Did they, uh, hurt you?

602
00:43:24,732 --> 00:43:25,763
No?

603
00:43:25,793 --> 00:43:27,376
Well, that's a good thing to know,

604
00:43:27,377 --> 00:43:28,917
huh?

605
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,682
Ah...

606
00:43:34,481 --> 00:43:36,271
And how about you?

607
00:43:37,254 --> 00:43:40,061
It's just a Nick. I'll be OK.

608
00:43:40,091 --> 00:43:43,346
Oh. May I see?

609
00:43:47,202 --> 00:43:48,748
Hmm...

610
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:50,406
Yeah, good.

611
00:43:51,581 --> 00:43:52,974
Good.

612
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:55,971
Take the children. Go.

613
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:01,175
Come. Go.

614
00:44:01,364 --> 00:44:04,031
No! Wait a moment.

615
00:44:05,092 --> 00:44:06,285
Wait.

616
00:44:12,977 --> 00:44:16,096
- No!
- Be quiet.

617
00:44:16,543 --> 00:44:18,887
Do not touch her.

618
00:44:19,202 --> 00:44:21,523
She is corrupted.

1
00:00:00,152 --> 00:00:01,732
Previously on The Strain...

2
00:00:01,762 --> 00:00:03,631
You have two bosses now:

3
00:00:03,632 --> 00:00:06,553
The ones at the CDC and me.

4
00:00:06,554 --> 00:00:09,478
I waved that van through at
the airport after you sealed it.

5
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:11,763
They paid me a little bit of
money to do 'em a favor, alright?

6
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:15,822
I've seen 'em in the
tunnels. Something big.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

8
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:26,593
OK, then...

9
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:28,757
You're saying we kill the Master
and that's somehow

10
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:30,633
- gonna stop this plague?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,166
That makes no biological sense!
How does that work?

12
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:35,970
At every turn, everything I said
has proven to be correct.

13
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:38,319
- Yes, but...
- This is no different.

14
00:00:46,436 --> 00:00:48,993
I give you another day of life, Jew.

15
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:54,014
Are you alright?

16
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:04,300
- Are you OK?
- Am I injured?

17
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,282
No, but we have missed our opportunity...

18
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,497
And there will be consequences.

19
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:13,363
How did it move like that?

20
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:16,940
The vampires you've seen
before are newly formed,

21
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,754
in the earliest stages of maturity.

22
00:01:18,784 --> 00:01:20,462
I shot him in the leg.

23
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:22,989
Had you struck bone, it might
have hobbled him.

24
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,921
Are you saying gunshots don't kill them?

25
00:01:24,922 --> 00:01:27,636
It's hard to wound
them fatally with a gun.

26
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,245
Strigoi flesh heals rapidly,

27
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:32,512
but silver burns them.

28
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:34,239
It's been many, many years

29
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:36,649
since Eichhorst tasted such pain.

30
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:39,023
By wounding him, we have sent

31
00:01:39,053 --> 00:01:40,971
the Master a message.

32
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:45,163
I do not think we will have
to wait long for his reply.

33
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:47,782
I really, really don't
like the sound of that.

34
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:51,900
Tunnels are the perfect
ecology for them, aren't they?

35
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:54,155
Dank, dark, devoid of sunlight.

36
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:56,144
We already know vampires
don't like sunlight.

37
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:57,924
Not vampires, viruses.

38
00:01:58,187 --> 00:02:00,398
The die-off rate for
any genome-based pathogen

39
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:03,838
when exposed to direct
ultraviolet light is over 90%.

40
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:05,495
That's why sun desiccates them.

41
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:07,217
And at nighttime, they have free reign.

42
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,932
It's nighttime now.

43
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,401
New York City is an open buffet.

44
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,896
Unless...

45
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:17,905
We can find a way to simulate
our own sunlight.

46
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:54,952
Ugh! Aaah...

47
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:27,417
_

48
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:36,206
Shit! It's closed.

49
00:03:36,236 --> 00:03:38,067
Where's another medical supply store?

50
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:40,688
Uvc light? Bushwick.

51
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:43,541
Here. Can you wait a minute?

52
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:52,196
Well, I guess we're staying here.

53
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,211
That window over there.

54
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:06,178
We're breaking in?

55
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,500
- We're burglars now?
- Burglars, vigilantes,

56
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,440
vampire killers.

57
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,057
Add it to the list.

58
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:24,308
Alright, get ready for an alarm.

59
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:34,467
Must be a silent alarm.

60
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:35,728
Hurry.

61
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,172
Hold up. Wait.

62
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,173
You hear something?

63
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:57,430
I think it was outside.

64
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:01,538
Let's just do this and get out of here.

65
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:08,071
Say something, so I know
you're not one of them.

66
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:12,037
You can put the gun down.

67
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,028
We tried the door.

68
00:05:14,058 --> 00:05:15,593
Nobody answered.

69
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:17,663
This is a legitimate medical emergency.

70
00:05:17,854 --> 00:05:19,994
We broke into requisition supplies.

71
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,120
Requisition, huh?

72
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,851
You look like a bunch of looters to me.

73
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,655
We're from the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention.

74
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:30,029
Who are you?

75
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:34,100
I'm a looter.

76
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:47,907
- sync & corrections by wolfen -
- www.addic7ed.com -

77
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:00,267
Right here.

78
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:02,365
They were right here.

79
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:05,736
The uvc lights, they were...
They're gone!

80
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:09,172
I guess you've seen those
sons of bitches too, huh?

81
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:12,355
Hey, what are you gonna
do with those lights?

82
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:14,277
Same thing as you, I bet.

83
00:06:14,328 --> 00:06:16,900
Sunlight fries these big munchers.

84
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:19,430
That means ultraviolet radiation.

85
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:23,220
- UVC light is the strongest there is.
- We need those lamps.

86
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,657
You're the airplane doctor.

87
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:30,498
I saw you on TV. Right? Hmm.

88
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:34,546
Aren't you some kind of
dangerous criminal or something?

89
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:35,890
Hey, pal,

90
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,451
the police are gonna be here any minute.

91
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,964
No, they're not.

92
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:41,838
I took out the phone
lines at the junction box.

93
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,593
No alarm. Besides, by my guess,

94
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:48,778
the cops have bigger things
to worry about by now.

95
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:49,938
Don't you think?

96
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:53,784
Any reward for turning you in?

97
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:56,019
No, sorry.

98
00:06:56,578 --> 00:06:58,524
Too bad for me.

99
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:00,357
Very good for you.

100
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:02,182
You, uh...

101
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:04,494
encountered these creatures?

102
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:06,663
Sort of...

103
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:09,003
I exterminated a couple.

104
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:11,990
You say "exterminate"?

105
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,877
That's what I do, Pops,
I'm a city exterminator.

106
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:17,440
So the government's getting
in on the fight, huh?

107
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:18,655
Not officially.

108
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:20,751
What are you gonna do with 12 lamps?

109
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:23,046
I'm not gonna run out for a while.

110
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:26,421
So it's every man for himself already?

111
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:29,760
If so, then this battle is over
before it even began.

112
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:33,562
I'll tell you what...

113
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,912
I'll give you three.

114
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:39,852
- Three?
- What? Grandpa wants one?

115
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:45,183
We'll take six.

116
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:46,767
Half.

117
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:53,760
I can survive with six. But only six!

118
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,236
Why don't we get some phones?
Those pay-as-you-go types.

119
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:06,688
Cell phones aren't working,
something about the network.

120
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:08,913
Eventually, they'll work and
we'll need a way to communicate.

121
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:10,844
We might as well load up on
food and drinks while we can.

122
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:14,147
- Let's make it quick.
- Go ahead, I'll be right along.

123
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,983
How did you get here, Pops?

124
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:20,453
We travelled by subway and taxi cab.

125
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:23,356
I wouldn't go back that way if I were you.

126
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:25,535
The subway tunnels, that's where they are.

127
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:28,962
- Dozens of them.
- Thousands, I should think.

128
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:32,465
These tunnels, you know them well?

129
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,947
Very well.

130
00:08:33,977 --> 00:08:36,869
A bizarre attack at Leisure Horizons...

131
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:56,928
- His son appeared...
- Machine is slow tonight.

132
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,824
... and viciously assaulted his father

133
00:08:58,854 --> 00:09:00,484
in a corridor outside his room.

134
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:04,084
I know it's good. Could you
please just swipe it again?

135
00:09:10,404 --> 00:09:12,951
Credit card machine's down. Shit!

136
00:09:12,981 --> 00:09:15,379
I don't have any cash.

137
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:17,230
Shocking.

138
00:09:17,717 --> 00:09:19,438
Here.

139
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:24,021
The ATMs are gonna be a problem
for the next few days, so...

140
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:27,695
I know that face. What did you do,

141
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:30,227
you and your crew of weirdo hackers?

142
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,624
Nothing much

143
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,177
unless you want to use
a computer or cell phone.

144
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:36,763
Seriously?

145
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:38,398
Why?

146
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:40,568
Because somebody paid me
a lot of money to do it.

147
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:43,603
- You used to think I was genius.
- Did I?

148
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:47,573
How may we get in touch with you?

149
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:49,609
Perhaps we can help each other.

150
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,690
I work alone.

151
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:55,381
Where else have you seen these vampires.

152
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:57,817
Vampires? No, no, no, no, no.

153
00:09:57,885 --> 00:09:59,889
No. Not like Dracula.

154
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,219
No, they don't have any
fangs or anything like that.

155
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:04,361
They're more like rat people,

156
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:06,459
you know?

157
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:08,628
You'll excuse me.

158
00:10:11,702 --> 00:10:13,266
- He's right, you know?
- Who?

159
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:14,927
That exterminator.

160
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:16,893
I grew up with food shortages.

161
00:10:16,923 --> 00:10:19,806
People fighting over goods, medicine.

162
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:22,957
There's gonna be looting,
and panic, and vigilantes.

163
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:27,146
Aside from us, you mean?

164
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,276
Nora, time to go.

165
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:34,120
What the hell?!

166
00:10:53,437 --> 00:10:55,091
Oh, my God!

167
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,760
Crazy old man with a bloody sword!

168
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,127
Unholy filth.

169
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:36,582
Yeah. Just give me that.

170
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,757
Nail gun, huh?

171
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:51,197
Interesting.

172
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,819
What? You want some more? Huh?

173
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,487
- Jim, come on, let's go!
- Screw this.

174
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,270
So what? You could speak to these things?

175
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,092
- Give me the phone!
- I have to count this first!

176
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,770
Watch out for the pump!

177
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:34,061
I need a plug!

178
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:37,287
- Where's the outlet?!
- Over there, but don't touch!

179
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:49,390
It's jammed!

180
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:52,529
- That's why I carry rebar.
- Wait, there's too many.

181
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,384
I need your help.

182
00:13:02,943 --> 00:13:04,586
Now or never!

183
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,036
- Aim for their heads!
- Forgive me.

184
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:18,715
Come on!

185
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:23,804
Come... come on! Ah!

186
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:41,749
Come on!

187
00:13:44,977 --> 00:13:46,918
Come on! I got him!

188
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,571
Oh! Oh!

189
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:54,832
Inside! Now!

190
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:57,641
Here.

191
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,546
At least we know the light works.

192
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:42,033
Not through glass, there's
a natural UV barrier.

193
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:44,407
Filters out 80 to 90% of UV radiation.

194
00:14:44,437 --> 00:14:45,871
Jim, what happened?

195
00:14:46,623 --> 00:14:47,927
Scraped when she knocked me down.

196
00:14:47,957 --> 00:14:49,840
OK. Go to the restroom, wash it out.

197
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,571
Go out, all of you! I'll call police!

198
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:56,210
Go ahead, Apu! Fire it
off in there! Go deaf!

199
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,399
Look, I don't want no trouble.
I'm just a working man here.

200
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:09,877
You let me go, I'm out of your hair.

201
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:12,225
We all want to get out of here.

202
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:15,229
Why did you just lock us in?

203
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:26,449
Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on?

204
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:29,734
- What are those things?
- Strigoi. Vampires.

205
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,553
He's kidding, right?

206
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,749
Does it look like he's kidding?

207
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:41,996
Look at us.

208
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,341
- It's us or them.
- I know.

209
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,367
If we charge these lamps,
we can walk out of here.

210
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:32,566
These glass windows
aren't keeping 'em out.

211
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:35,840
- What are they waiting for?
- Reinforcements.

212
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,519
We have very little time.

213
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:41,565
I need the rules.

214
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:47,121
What kills these things,
aside from direct sunlight?

215
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:49,886
The brainstem must be destroyed

216
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,147
or severed from the spinal cord.

217
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:55,103
So, beheading...

218
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:58,399
or rebar bashing.

219
00:16:58,627 --> 00:17:00,053
What about guns?

220
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,375
Lead rounds can maim
them if they strike bone.

221
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:05,418
Flesh wounds heal without pain.

222
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:08,740
Only... silver truly...

223
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,749
hurts them. They fear it.

224
00:17:11,127 --> 00:17:13,731
Silver sword and silver bullet.

225
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:17,940
And that nail gun that you have there.

226
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:20,592
Aside from silver nails, uh...

227
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:22,556
What? Standard issue?

228
00:17:23,426 --> 00:17:25,359
From Home Depot.

229
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,416
Vasiliy Fet.

230
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:33,574
It's good to know you.

231
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:35,905
Abraham Setrakian.

232
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:38,657
Pleasure.

233
00:17:42,546 --> 00:17:43,913
God! 9-1-1 isn't working.

234
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:45,538
All I'm getting are recorded messages.

235
00:17:45,568 --> 00:17:47,347
Yeah, obviously.

236
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:52,522
- You did this too?
- A little less volume, please.

237
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:54,714
Oh, my God! What have you done?!

238
00:17:54,744 --> 00:17:56,227
- We're trapped here!
- Shut up or I'm gonna punch you

239
00:17:56,257 --> 00:17:58,035
in the mouth!

240
00:18:02,824 --> 00:18:04,737
Hey, get out
of there. Need your help.

241
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:07,511
Extension cords, and food,
and hydrogen peroxide.

242
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:11,013
- I make list of everything you steal!
- We're not stealing anything.

243
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:12,819
All right, listen everybody.
We need your help.

244
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:15,463
We're doctors from the
Center for Disease Control.

245
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:17,867
There's a plague that's spreading
through New York City.

246
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,598
Is it a plague or is it vampires?

247
00:18:19,628 --> 00:18:22,015
Because he said vampires.

248
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,496
It's a transformative disease
that makes people predatory

249
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:27,888
and extremely dangerous,
but we have an idea about

250
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:29,649
how to get us all out of here tonight.

251
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,858
Sorry, man. Good luck with
all that, but I got to...

252
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:33,641
You're not gonna make it. Trust me.

253
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:36,936
Trust you? I don't even
know you! How can I trust you?

254
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:38,093
No, sir, please listen to me.

255
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:40,160
If you go out there, you will be killed.

256
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,634
Hey! What are you doing? Stop!

257
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:42,638
- No!
- No!

258
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:44,561
- Nikki, hey, don't!
- Hey!

259
00:18:46,186 --> 00:18:47,341
Ah!

260
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:51,712
Oh, God!

261
00:19:02,897 --> 00:19:06,693
Son of a bitch. She made it.

262
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:09,263
She ditched me.

263
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,896
That bitch!

264
00:19:10,926 --> 00:19:14,229
- You said not to run!
- They're not following her.

265
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:24,044
They're not here for her.

266
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:32,155
They're here for us.

267
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:36,134
"Us"? Who's "us"?

268
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:37,856
Not us, you!

269
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,839
We go to my truck. 
It's right over there.

270
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:42,447
It's too far.

271
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:44,100
We won't all make it.

272
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,778
The bread truck's right over there.

273
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:46,960
Anybody else wants to go now?

274
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,284
- I got plenty of room in back.
- Are you kidding? I'm in.

275
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,772
This is what they thrive on:

276
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:53,996
Fear, panic,

277
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,891
divisiveness.

278
00:19:56,483 --> 00:19:58,204
There's strength in numbers.

279
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:01,782
We must make a plan and act together.

280
00:20:03,665 --> 00:20:06,581
It's called beat 'em to the truck!

281
00:20:06,611 --> 00:20:10,457
Just you and me then. You're ready?

282
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:16,213
Oh, come on!

283
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:44,908
Go on!

284
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,302
Oh, my God! This can't be happening.

285
00:20:55,824 --> 00:20:58,505
Nobody leaves until we all leave!

286
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,215
Are we stuck till morning?

287
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:11,051
We won't make it till morning.
We won't even last another hour.

288
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,542
- We won't?
- Many more will be coming.

289
00:21:17,572 --> 00:21:21,194
Soon, they'll swarm and overrun us.

290
00:21:21,987 --> 00:21:24,731
They can communicate 
with each other now?

291
00:21:25,321 --> 00:21:27,043
They're connected to the Master

292
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:29,936
who sees through every strigoi eye.

293
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:31,960
He sees through them?

294
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,359
When will you decide to believe me?!

295
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:54,528
Late this afternoon,
the mayor again assured

296
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,348
the citizens of New York City
that he has no intention

297
00:21:57,378 --> 00:22:00,205
of asking the Governor for help 
from the National Guard.

298
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,239
Here's what he had to say
to reporters in front

299
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:04,222
of City Hall earlier today.

300
00:22:04,252 --> 00:22:06,256
Our fine police Commissioner 
has assured me...

301
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:09,257
Give me 25 Powerball Quick Picks, Apu.

302
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:10,938
I am Hassan.

303
00:22:11,184 --> 00:22:13,964
Hassan, 25 Powerball Quick Picks.

304
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:15,966
Make of them a winner.

305
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,729
Lottery machine is down.

306
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,112
Credit card machine down.
9-1-1 down.

307
00:22:20,142 --> 00:22:23,150
50 dollars' worth 
of scratch tickets then.

308
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,856
Yeah? My luck, uh...

309
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,092
Can only get better.

310
00:22:28,122 --> 00:22:30,814
Maybe in a tight cordon
with the UVC lamps

311
00:22:30,898 --> 00:22:32,995
and the weapons, we
can make a break for it.

312
00:22:33,025 --> 00:22:34,785
How about the other cars in the garage?

313
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:37,399
One's got no engine,
and one's got no wheels.

314
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:43,448
I stuck around to help.

315
00:22:43,478 --> 00:22:46,022
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do.

316
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:49,499
- Jim, what is that?
- What?

317
00:22:50,678 --> 00:22:52,085
Come here.

318
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:54,270
What?

319
00:22:55,435 --> 00:22:58,166
I don't like that look.

320
00:23:02,122 --> 00:23:04,322
- Hey, careful, that will burn.
- Close your eyes.

321
00:23:04,352 --> 00:23:07,061
United States
has historically held,

322
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:09,183
"It's none of our constitutional...

323
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:18,995
Alright, guys, come on. Talk to me.

324
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:21,965
Your cheek...

325
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:24,201
Yeah, got cut.

326
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,911
I think you got nicked.

327
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:33,877
It's just a scrape.

328
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:36,446
- Jim...
- It's a worm.

329
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,769
I need, uh, tweezers,

330
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,839
a lighter. And where's
that hydrogen peroxide?

331
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,231
- Doctor, a word please.
- I need, uh...

332
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:53,831
paper towels, gloves, and, uh, a knife.

333
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,587
- What?!
- I'm gonna cut it out of you.

334
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:14,830
What are you gonna do
with that box cutter?

335
00:24:17,186 --> 00:24:19,412
Here. Drink this.

336
00:24:32,932 --> 00:24:34,305
The stinger must have grazed you.

337
00:24:34,335 --> 00:24:36,949
Maybe that's all it takes
to transmit the parasite.

338
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:38,659
Do you feel it anywhere?

339
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:42,269
Anywhere? I can feel it everywhere now.

340
00:24:43,418 --> 00:24:45,120
Am I gonna end up like 
the airline pilot?

341
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,695
Not if we get it before.

342
00:24:46,725 --> 00:24:48,957
- Before what?
- Before it reproduces.

343
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:57,294
They're on the roof.

344
00:25:00,822 --> 00:25:03,587
At the backdoor. Come on.

345
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,231
- What do you see?
- Not too close.

346
00:25:08,261 --> 00:25:09,622
I don't want to dig in any deeper.

347
00:25:09,652 --> 00:25:11,292
Deep...

348
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,023
Get it out already.

349
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,564
They're looking for
multiple points of ingress,

350
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:19,687
just like any other vermin.

351
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:21,874
Can you... can you see it?

352
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,937
I think I can feel it around 
my eye now.

353
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:25,635
- I'm not gonna lie to you...
- Get it out!

354
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:27,703
Skin on face is very thin and
it's full of nerve endings.

355
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:30,527
- This is gonna hurt like a bitch.
- Don't care, just get it out!

356
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:31,719
Get it out!

357
00:25:47,118 --> 00:25:48,422
Hey! How fast can we move

358
00:25:48,452 --> 00:25:50,444
the wheels from this car to that one?

359
00:25:56,993 --> 00:26:00,645
- Ah! What's happening?
- That's it. That's it.

360
00:26:04,197 --> 00:26:06,854
Alright, almost there.

361
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:10,346
Good. Got it.

362
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,153
Don't move, don't move.

363
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:19,576
Don't lose it.

364
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,032
Thank God.

365
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:33,939
Almost there.

366
00:26:35,433 --> 00:26:37,242
You better hurry up.

367
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:40,730
They're up to something.

368
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:46,519
It's not pretty, but it will hold

369
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:49,111
till we get you to a hospital.

370
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:01,239
Well, you cut my face open.

371
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:03,493
- I did, didn't I?
- Yeah.

372
00:27:06,144 --> 00:27:07,605
I could have turned into one of them.

373
00:27:07,635 --> 00:27:09,640
Don't even think about it.

374
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:14,648
You two saved my life...

375
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:17,384
My soul.

376
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:19,336
Thank you.

377
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:23,548
I think we may have stumbled
onto a potential treatment here.

378
00:27:23,578 --> 00:27:26,467
- An early intervention protocol.
- Something new.

379
00:27:26,497 --> 00:27:28,536
I don't want to go so
far as to say a cure.

380
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:31,556
Hey! Oh, God!
Someone, come quick!

381
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,635
Turn away!

382
00:27:35,665 --> 00:27:36,881
No, no!

383
00:27:36,911 --> 00:27:39,477
You can't come in here!

384
00:27:39,507 --> 00:27:41,820
Get him out!

385
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:51,935
- They're using tools now.
- Not just tools,

386
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,284
but distraction.

387
00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:59,471
What are you doing? Wait for us.

388
00:28:01,992 --> 00:28:05,801
You're gonna tell me
what we're doing out here?

389
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:09,123
It's cutting off power!

390
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,372
- That didn't stop him.
- I didn't hit him in the head!

391
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:22,033
Don't distract me.

392
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:47,123
Here's some candles.

393
00:28:47,471 --> 00:28:49,509
Hey, Hassan, give us some batteries.

394
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,702
They're coming in!

395
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,337
- Someone help us!
- The garage.

396
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,745
- In you go!
- Hey! Get in here!

397
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:04,340
The car! I'm almost done!

398
00:29:04,524 --> 00:29:07,306
Somebody, block the door!

399
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:10,647
Fall back! Fall back!

400
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:36,172
Getting 'em on all sides now!
Can't wait any longer.

401
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:38,591
How much more time do we have
left in those lamp batteries?

402
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:41,594
If we get 20 minutes out of
these things, I'll be amazed.

403
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:43,134
That means we have...

404
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:45,999
20 more minutes of life, if that.

405
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:51,031
The bread truck is our only hope.

406
00:29:52,305 --> 00:29:54,607
OK. That didn't work
out so well for the actual

407
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:57,221
bread truck driver who still
has the keys by the way.

408
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:58,772
And once you get outside
with those things,

409
00:29:58,802 --> 00:30:00,868
that truck is a lot farther away 
than it seems.

410
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:04,033
Fine. We'll put it to a vote.
Who wants to stay and die?

411
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:15,688
The longer we allow
ourselves to be distracted

412
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:17,741
from our only goal, survival,

413
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:21,768
the more likely we are to pull
short of achieving it!

414
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:25,969
Mr. Fet, you spent your life
engaging vermin in this city.

415
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:29,487
Perhaps, you have 
some suggestions for...

416
00:30:29,517 --> 00:30:32,679
getting us from here to there.

417
00:30:38,987 --> 00:30:40,591
Hey, uh, what shall I do?

418
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:42,797
Take those bottles over there
and empty 'em in the bathroom.

419
00:30:54,508 --> 00:30:58,138
Trying to rip off the HVAC unit
and get into the venting.

420
00:30:58,168 --> 00:31:00,105
They're getting more lucid, 
aren't they?

421
00:31:00,435 --> 00:31:02,710
In one month, they 
will be fully mature.

422
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,337
Like Eichhorst?

423
00:31:04,577 --> 00:31:06,175
No, not like him.

424
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:09,332
There are a few to whom
the Master grants greater power.

425
00:31:09,362 --> 00:31:12,123
They retain parts of 
their former selves.

426
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:17,380
Eichhorst is one of the chosen.

427
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:20,545
Even among the strigoi,
there is a caste system.

428
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,796
No offense, but every time I talk to you,

429
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:25,806
I come away feeling worse.

430
00:31:26,482 --> 00:31:29,424
Hassan, it's time to come out
of there, OK?

431
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,554
- Alright? You're coming with us.
- It is safe here.

432
00:31:31,778 --> 00:31:34,924
Don't be a fool. You want to
die inside a cigarette box?

433
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:38,174
I stay! I wait for police!
And who pays for this?!

434
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:47,795
It's a 250$ win, alright?

435
00:31:48,598 --> 00:31:51,112
Keep the change, you earned it.

436
00:32:02,895 --> 00:32:04,303
Want some?

437
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:08,091
- Sure?
- Yeah.

438
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:10,043
Your loss.

439
00:32:18,648 --> 00:32:20,221
So, what was your name?

440
00:32:20,586 --> 00:32:24,059
Dutch. Dutch Velders.
How has this happened?

441
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:29,659
There's no short answer.
Let's get this done.

442
00:32:40,156 --> 00:32:41,467
Bit crazy, right?

443
00:32:41,497 --> 00:32:44,597
For you to save my life in here
only to get stung out there.

444
00:32:44,627 --> 00:32:47,230
I think Setrakian's right,
we just need to stay together.

445
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,382
It was inside of my face.

446
00:32:50,338 --> 00:32:53,072
Eph, what you did... was incredible.

447
00:32:53,976 --> 00:32:56,617
We can talk about it later, let's
just focus on getting out of here.

448
00:32:56,647 --> 00:32:59,581
So sorry. I knew what
I was doing was wrong;

449
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,221
I just didn't know how wrong.

450
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:04,097
What to do now is just try to go forward.

451
00:33:04,181 --> 00:33:07,478
I got it and I appreciate it.

452
00:33:11,612 --> 00:33:12,620
What?

453
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:18,175
Are you kidding?

454
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:21,030
Whatever. Everything's fine.
I don't feel anything.

455
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:23,496
I can't feel anything, it's fine.

456
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,562
Oh, shit!

457
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:55,188
Oh, shit!

458
00:33:56,906 --> 00:33:59,702
I'm done for, aren't I?

459
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:02,296
We're gonna take you to the hospital.

460
00:34:02,326 --> 00:34:03,819
We're going to give you antiparasitics.

461
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:07,134
We'll try chemo. We have a
lot of tools at our disposal.

462
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:09,447
You couldn't save Captain Redfern!

463
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:13,833
Oh, shit.

464
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,055
You have to kill me.

465
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:22,666
We're not killing you.

466
00:34:22,696 --> 00:34:25,535
We don't have time for this
debate. We have to go. Now!

467
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:27,301
You have to, uh...

468
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:29,682
Release me. It's the expression, right?

469
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,801
- That's not a solution.
- You killed the others!

470
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,850
- It was a solution for them!
- It was different.

471
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:37,137
I want to know the truth.

472
00:34:38,111 --> 00:34:40,443
Once I turn, I'm gonna
go after them, right?

473
00:34:40,773 --> 00:34:44,234
The ones you love, yes.

474
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:50,469
Cruelest feature of this dark curse

475
00:34:50,499 --> 00:34:52,908
is that the bond that joins you in life,

476
00:34:52,938 --> 00:34:56,008
human love, is corrupted
into the need to...

477
00:34:56,038 --> 00:34:58,661
consume those closest to you.

478
00:34:59,148 --> 00:35:00,797
Sylvia.

479
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,053
My parents.

480
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,526
Don't listen to him, Jim.

481
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:09,796
We can fight this.

482
00:35:09,826 --> 00:35:11,483
We just need to get you
out of here first.

483
00:35:11,513 --> 00:35:13,088
You cannot save him!

484
00:35:13,118 --> 00:35:14,610
We don't have time for this nonsense.

485
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:18,397
- This is my friend!
- Exactly.

486
00:35:18,427 --> 00:35:22,313
- So the humane thing...
- The humane thing is to treat him!

487
00:35:22,343 --> 00:35:25,079
He comes with us! We don't
have to decide this now.

488
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:29,592
Nora... I'd rather be dead
than turn into one of them.

489
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,865
Your impulse is always to save, I know.

490
00:35:32,895 --> 00:35:35,295
Save your friend's soul.

491
00:35:35,486 --> 00:35:38,165
Release him. Do it now before he turns!

492
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:41,838
Don't listen to him, Jimmy.
You know modern technology...

493
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,756
- No, stop!
- better than I do.

494
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,342
We can help you.

495
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,818
- It's too late.
- No! No!

496
00:35:52,927 --> 00:35:54,250
Aah!

497
00:35:59,332 --> 00:36:02,918
What did you do? Why did you do that?

498
00:36:03,157 --> 00:36:05,087
Because you couldn't.

499
00:36:05,402 --> 00:36:06,950
What gave you the right?!

500
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,649
He wanted to die, and you were arguing

501
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:12,478
when we need to be moving!

502
00:36:22,021 --> 00:36:24,106
I did your friend a favor.

503
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,989
It was not your decision to make!

504
00:36:49,786 --> 00:36:51,716
Jim, I'm so sorry.

505
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,640
Here they come.

506
00:37:06,577 --> 00:37:08,616
Hassan! Last chance!

507
00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:22,182
Go, go!

508
00:37:26,373 --> 00:37:28,095
Doc!

509
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:31,382
If you get stung, I won't
hesitate to return the favor.

510
00:37:31,412 --> 00:37:34,173
That's the spirit, Doc. That's the spirit.

511
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,597
Stay together!

512
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:56,428
I need a credit card!

513
00:37:56,458 --> 00:37:58,149
You don't have a credit card?

514
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:00,689
I'm currently in dispute
over my credit limit.

515
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:03,229
Why doesn't that surprise me?

516
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,737
- What's your code?
- 1, 1, 2, 1, 5.

517
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:15,691
- What's the hold up?!
- I'm awaiting authorization!

518
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:18,743
I, uh, I don't know how to
tell you guys this, but...

519
00:38:19,055 --> 00:38:20,629
Approved!

520
00:38:24,984 --> 00:38:26,701
Give me the buckets.

521
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,674
Gasoline doesn't want to be a liquid;

522
00:38:31,704 --> 00:38:34,064
it wants to be a vapor, so go fast, OK?

523
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:35,624
OK.

524
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,945
Nora!

525
00:38:42,646 --> 00:38:43,877
OK.

526
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:49,051
- Hold them back!
- Hurry!

527
00:38:51,652 --> 00:38:54,165
Put the light over here!

528
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:57,948
Behind you!

529
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:03,239
Put the light here!

530
00:39:09,156 --> 00:39:13,242
I got you covered here!
Over here!

531
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:17,632
Heads up!

532
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:20,780
Doc, wake up! Let's go!

533
00:39:24,171 --> 00:39:25,218
Go! Go!

534
00:39:29,048 --> 00:39:31,627
- Go, go, go, go!
- My light!

535
00:39:31,657 --> 00:39:33,036
- My light went out!
- I got you!

536
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:35,523
Go, go, go!

537
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,086
Go!

538
00:39:42,061 --> 00:39:43,766
- Come on!
- Go!

539
00:39:43,796 --> 00:39:45,562
- Come on!
- Go!

540
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,483
Go! Go, come on, go!

541
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:50,979
Yaaa!

542
00:39:51,064 --> 00:39:54,533
Hurry! Quickly!

543
00:39:55,947 --> 00:39:57,869
Doc, keys!

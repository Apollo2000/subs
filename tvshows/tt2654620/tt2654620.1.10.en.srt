1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,701
Previously on The Strain...

2
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:04,615
Dad, what's happening?

3
00:00:04,645 --> 00:00:07,945
This is part of the epidemic
we've been investigating

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,370
Matt was infected. Now
I need you to tell me:

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,076
when was the last time
you heard from your mother?

6
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:14,603
This morning. They were arguing
about you because you

7
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:17,633
told us to go to Vermont. Matt
didn't come home last night.

8
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:19,063
Do you know who Eldritch Palmer is?

9
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:21,228
One of the most powerful
men in the world, yes.

10
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:23,430
- He hired me.
- What did you do?

11
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:25,820
I worked my ass off to
shut the Internet down.

12
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,075
We can get the Master. He's nesting.

13
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:29,033
Somewhere in the city.

14
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:30,111
But I need your help.

15
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:32,460
- Where's Kelly?
- Kelly's MIA all day.

16
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,549
Where's Zack, Eph?

17
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,639
- He's with my colleagues.
- It's not safe here.

18
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:38,004
Right, right. In all your
concerned state,

19
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:39,950
you still find time to screw on the rug?

20
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,031
She's serious. You have to get out
of town as soon as possible.

21
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:45,000
You hurt my friend,
I will cut your heart out.

22
00:00:45,068 --> 00:00:47,970
I love my wife. She's
the mother of my son.

23
00:00:48,038 --> 00:00:49,938
I'd do anything to find her.

24

Yes!

26
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:57,189
Aw, crap.

27
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:31,640
No, come on! Please! Work!

28
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:40,359
Yes!

29
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,327
Dad! Dad, come here!

30
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:50,577
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Mom's phone, it moved.

31
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:52,361
- She's moving.
- What are you talking about?

32
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:54,341
I lost my phone a couple months ago.

33
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:55,835
I used this website to track it.

34
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:58,137
So I thought, you know,
maybe we could use it on her.

35
00:02:58,167 --> 00:02:59,213
You got online?

36
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:02,238
Barely. It's super slow, but
I finally got enough of a signal.

37
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:05,341
It's going in and out but I got
enough to see the phone move.

38
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:11,442
- You're sure it's moving?
- Yeah. Like 3 blocks.

39
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,866
If she's moving, she's
gotta be OK, right?

40
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:17,371
- It's a good sign.
- I'm going to call her.

41
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:30,810
Dad, it's ringing.

42
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:33,854
Hi, it's Kelly. Leave me a message

43
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:35,993
and I'll call you right back. Thanks.

44
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:38,823
Mom, it's me again.
Call me back, OK? Please?

45
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:42,923
Maybe it's on silent or something.

46
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:46,594
Why hasn't she called back?

47
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:52,032
- What was the location?
- This says...

48
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:54,377
Main and Front.

49
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:58,718
- No! Come on, please! Work!
- Shh, shh. It's OK. It's OK.

50
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:01,445
We know her location.

51
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,495
I'll get her.

The President has declared a bank holiday

54
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,292
in an attempt to stabilize
the nation's teetering

55
00:04:31,322 --> 00:04:32,648
- financial system.
- Hey.

56
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:33,950
- This latest move comes
- Hey.

57
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,009
in the wake of 23 bank
failures yesterday.

58
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:40,390
Despite these measures, the head
of the International Monetary Fund

59
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,673
hinted in a news conference today

60
00:04:42,703 --> 00:04:45,228
that the world financial
system is now teetering

61
00:04:45,258 --> 00:04:48,044
- on the brink of systematic...
- What's going on?

62
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:52,606
Zack tracked down Kelly's phone.

63
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,067

64
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,597
_

65
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,793
Good morning, Mrs. Martinez.

66
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:01,246
The phone is moving.

67
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:03,788
- Where is it?
- Astoria.

68
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,062
- Don't say it.
- I wasn't gonna.

69
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:08,370
Kelly could be alive.

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,492
The phone is moving during daylight.

71
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:12,540
She could've gotten out without
getting stung. We did.

72
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,579
They're mobilizing downstairs.
Setrakian has a plan.

73
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:17,481
I have to do this first.

74
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:23,236
I didn't mean to hurt you last night.

75
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,336
Nothing makes any sense anymore.
I don't know what I'm saying,

76
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:30,387
what I'm doing, but I knew
what I was doing... then.

77
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:33,385
I'm not sorry about that.

78
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,497
I know you tried to prepare me
for the worst

79
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:39,417
but I think there's a real
chance here, and

80
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:42,322
- so long as there is...
- Then you should go.

81
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,732
But you must be prepared
for what you might find.

82
00:05:50,153 --> 00:05:51,572
I get it.

83
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,711
Take your weapons.

84
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,670
- Any change?
- Still in the same place.

85
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,542
Can't I come? I don't
want to just sit here.

86
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:12,336
No, I need you to track the phone.

87
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:15,509
- Text me if the signal moves.
- What if it doesn't go through?

88
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:17,709
Keep texting.

89
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,299
Bring Mom back with you.

90
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:28,126
I tracked the epicenter
of the rat-free zone

91
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:30,157
right down here by 
the World Trade Centre.

92
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:32,737
I popped down into the
tunnels to investigate,

93
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:35,560
ended up eye-to-eye with
a few dozen of them.

94
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,116
It was a fun day.

95
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:41,935
In my opinion, attacking them
head-on on their own turf

96
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:44,650
seems like a good way for us all to die.

97
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,641
The thing about rats is they
always have a backdoor...

98
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:50,424
That's why it's so tricky to catch them.

99
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:55,419
I bet that the vamps...
I bet you they have one, too.

100
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:58,576
So this is my thinking, alright?

101
00:06:58,606 --> 00:07:01,655
We have to look at all the
decommissioned tunnels and lines

102
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:03,806
near the World Trade Centre.

103
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:05,397
Which this map...

104
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:08,407
Doesn't help us very much.

105
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,585
It'd be great to get online.

106
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:13,617
I know this great transit 
archive on there.

107
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,439
The Internet's for shit, so...

108
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:23,441
- Yeah, sorry about for that.
- About what?

109
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,354
I brought it down.

110
00:07:27,384 --> 00:07:31,016
Uh... I think I missed that.

111
00:07:31,046 --> 00:07:35,120
Yeah, not just me, but... my crew.

112
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:42,160
An old rich guy hired us
to interrupt mobile services and...

113
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,842
crash most Internet traffic.

114
00:07:45,537 --> 00:07:46,949
Eldritch Palmer.

115
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,236
Preventing the spread of information.

116
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:53,398
- And you helped him?!
- I never wanted to hurt people.

117
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:57,878
I have been trying to figure out
a way to make things right.

118
00:07:57,908 --> 00:08:00,004
Can you do that?

119
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:01,765
Maybe.

120
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:04,317
If I can get back into Palmer's offices.

121
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:07,576
- How would you get access?
- I could get her in.

122
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:10,407
Use my city credentials.
Fly under the radar.

123
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:13,373
- Sure, I could be your boss.
- Assistant.

124
00:08:13,403 --> 00:08:15,276
- Boss.
- Details.

125
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:21,235
I always wanted to get 
into that building.

126
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:40,656
Keep up, let's go!

127
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:58,324
Hey baby, the world
about to end. You want...

128
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:03,210
Hey, where'd you get that phone?

129
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:05,212
- That's mine. That's my phone.
- I know you stole it.

130
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,081
Where's the woman you took it from?

131
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:11,788
Where'd you find it?!

132
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,538
Back off or I'm not telling you shit.

133
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:22,550
I found this on the street.
Wasn't any woman with it.

134
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:26,077
- You're gonna show me where...
- Show me your badge po-po.

135
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,841
Do I look like a cop? I'm a doctor.

136
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:30,686
For real?

137
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,431
It's infected.

138
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,735
Jesus Christ that's a bad burn.

139
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:41,341
- How long have you had that?
- Got it last week.

140
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:51,397
OK, brea. Where did
you find the phone?

141
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:55,730
Help me up.

142
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:03,136
Thank you.

143
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:28,896
There. It was right there.

144
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,413
- Did you see the woman driving?
- No.

145
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:03,863
_

146
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:02,556
Matt?

147
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,669
Matt?!

148
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:21,613
You know not talking is part
of what ended my marriage.

149
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:27,721
God! Way to be a grownup!

150
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:32,963
Look, if you don't want
to talk, at least let me in.

151
00:12:32,993 --> 00:12:35,155
I need to get ready for work.

152
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:49,108
She's so mean.

153
00:12:49,138 --> 00:12:51,684
Hey, you're here.

154
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,527
- It's a school day, right?
- Yeah, but like half the kids are out.

155
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,193
Most of the staff, too.

156
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,848
- Are they sick?
- I guess.

157
00:13:01,349 --> 00:13:03,633
A bunch of them didn't
even bother to call in.

158
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:05,738
Miranda is going
to release the kids early.

159
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:08,059
No point with barely half attendance.

160
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:10,395
What?

161
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:13,647
Do you know something?

162
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:18,237
Eph warned me about a virus.

163
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:20,155
Something to do with that plane at JFK.

164
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:23,804
- Said we should leave town.
- Seriously?

165
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:25,839
Oh, God.

166
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,875
If you want to let Miranda know.

167
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:32,212
But I'm getting Zack and
I'm getting out of town.

168
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:35,482
You should, too.

169
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,939
Matt?

170
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,162
Where are you?

171
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:50,637
Called a half day at school.
Everyone is sick. Eph was right.

172
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:53,467
Matt?

173
00:13:53,497 --> 00:13:55,769
Enough already!

174
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,473
Did you hear me? Eph was right.

175
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:03,410
And you had him arrested by the FBI...

176
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:06,790
Oh, my God, Matt?

177
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,621
Ah! Ah!

178
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,134
Ah!

179
00:14:31,484 --> 00:14:34,766
Aah! Ah!

180
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:07,987
Zack?

181
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:11,451
Sweetheart, where are you?

182
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:13,300
An equal number of people who intend,

183
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,131
it seems to be, to take
matters into their own hands.

184
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,282
Firearm sales have spiked...

185
00:17:19,312 --> 00:17:21,789
survival equipment,
propane tanks, generators,

186
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,487
canned food and the likes...

187
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,235
Kelly?

188
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:38,238
Oh my word. Are you OK?

189
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,972
Where's Zack? I'm here to pick him up.

190
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:46,078
Am I late?

191
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:48,368
- I...
- I think I'm late.

192
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:50,870
We dismissed early and
when we couldn't reach you,

193
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,017
your friend Diane came
to pick him up, I mean...

194
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:55,873
I-I know that you carpool.

195
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:58,693
Look, Kelly...

196
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:00,447
I think maybe you've been
in an accident and we should

197
00:18:00,477 --> 00:18:02,328
get you to a hospital.

198
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:04,565
Can you get Zack for me?

199
00:18:05,173 --> 00:18:08,765
- Please?
- Mm-hmm. I uh...

200
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:13,069
If you'll just excuse me, I'm
just going to make one call.

201
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:16,982
OK? I'll be right back.

202
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:25,237
I'm guessing that she's
been in a car accident

203
00:18:25,267 --> 00:18:27,817
and I think that she has a concussion.

204
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:30,219
Hello?

205
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:40,093
Kelly...

206
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,658
Back off!

207
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:46,095
Ah! Ah!

208
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,638
Argh!

209
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:08,757
OK, assistant. You believe
you're supposed to be there,

210
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:11,560
- they'll believe it.
- Sure.

211
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,762
You know this isn't my first
dance, O wise and powerful.

212
00:20:17,803 --> 00:20:20,411
So what's with the old pawn shop guy?

213
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,949
How are you friends with him?

214
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:25,318
Met him last night. Same as you.

215
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:26,532
Really?

216
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:29,889
Seemed to have such a shorthand.

217
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:35,494
What about you? What's your story?

218
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:40,138
No story. What you see is what you get.

219
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:45,338
Listen, honey. The pawn
shop guy is a vampire killer.

220
00:20:46,343 --> 00:20:49,724
If you could top that story
with your mysterious background,

221
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:52,245
then... go for it.

222
00:20:53,048 --> 00:20:56,616
Fine. What do you want to know about me?

223
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,191
This guy Palmer.

224
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:03,597
Guy dicks you over to bring
about end times?

225
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,027
If we're going to his building
just to borrow his Wi-Fi

226
00:21:08,057 --> 00:21:10,454
then you're wasting my time.

227
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:17,970
I wouldn't dream of wasting your time.

228
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:32,309
Hello.

229
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:34,777
Uh, New York Pest Control Services.

230
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:39,115
We have to inspect your
executive dining facilities.

231
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:42,246
I don't have you down here.

232
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:44,457
Hmm. Well they don't
let us make appointments

233
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:46,612
for inspections, you know?

234
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:50,459
I can't let you through
without an OK from security.

235
00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:52,274
You're sure about that?

236
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:54,826
It's pretty much just a quick look-see.

237
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:58,830
You know, another box I have
to check off for my hard-ass boss.

238
00:21:58,897 --> 00:22:00,247
In and out in 10?

239
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:08,830
Well, it looks like executive dining
is in between shifts anyway.

240
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:11,876
- So...
- Oh, perfect.

241
00:22:14,503 --> 00:22:16,961
Middle elevator, 25th floor.

242
00:22:18,126 --> 00:22:20,918
Thanks Lauren. You're the best.

243
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:23,254
And you have yourself a great day, OK?

244
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:26,688
- OK.
- Thanks.

245
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:31,229
Confidence. It's all about confidence.

246
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,369
- Will you follow us, please?
- Confidence or competence?

247
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:46,010
Now look, I don't want
to get you boys in trouble.

248
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:48,675
But as Pest Inspectors
for the City of New York,

249
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:51,616
we have the absolute right
to enter any licenced food...

250
00:22:51,646 --> 00:22:53,751
Hey. Shut up.

251
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:05,129
Alright. Thank you.

252
00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:10,294
Ms. Valders.

253
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:13,070
Reggie Fitzwilliam, you remember me?

254
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:15,573
'Cause I certainly remember you.

255
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:17,642
I see you've taken up rat catching.

256
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:18,909
So it appears.

257
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,635
Search them.

258
00:23:24,783 --> 00:23:26,507
Don't touch me.

259
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:52,272
- Use these for catching rats?
- Only really big ones.

260
00:23:55,332 --> 00:23:57,287
So what now?

261
00:23:57,317 --> 00:23:59,669
Mr. Palmer would like to see you.

262
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:02,286
No, not you.

263
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:04,191
Her.

264
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,054
Alone.

265
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,031
Kelly?

266
00:24:54,011 --> 00:24:55,099
You here?

267
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:03,347
_

268
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,620
We're live at the scene of
another of what may be

269
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,974
a series of bizarre murders.

270
00:25:08,004 --> 00:25:10,329
This tragic incident claimed the lives

271
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:13,293
of a young married couple
here in Brooklyn tonight.

272
00:25:13,323 --> 00:25:15,503
They were found in the
basement of their home

273
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:17,375
after a neighbour complained

274
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:20,687
of a terrible smell 
emanating from inside.

275
00:25:20,717 --> 00:25:24,574
Police sources say a disturbing
pattern of random violence

276
00:25:24,604 --> 00:25:26,697
has swept across New York City

277
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:28,085
in recent days.

278
00:25:28,115 --> 00:25:30,345
Police have been inundated with reports

279
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,243
of home invasions and attacks...

280
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:41,756
Oh my God! Oh my God, Kel!

281
00:25:41,786 --> 00:25:45,500
You scared the crap out
of me. What time is it?

282
00:25:49,276 --> 00:25:50,546
Kel?

283
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,923
Kelly?

284
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:59,638
Matt did this?

285
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,505
Are you serious?

286
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:07,094
- Where's Zack...?
- What...

287
00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:09,656
What do you mean where's Zack?
Eph said Zack was with him.

288
00:26:09,686 --> 00:26:11,582
Kel, honey, you know what?
You're freaking me out, OK?

289
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,492
So I'm going to take you
to the Emergency Room, OK?

290
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:15,891
Mom?

291
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:20,879
What's... What's going on?

292
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:32,970
Ah! Ah! Kelly! What the...

293
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:35,940
Ah! What the hell are you doing?!

294
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:38,346
What the hell are you doing?! No!

295
00:26:38,376 --> 00:26:40,915
Ah! Ah!

296
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:20,560
OK.

297
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,146
Why in God's name would you
ever come back here?

298
00:27:33,176 --> 00:27:35,785
Because I don't like
being taken for a ride.

299
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:39,301
Now I know that Palmer's behind all this.

300
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:43,110
Evidently you're fine with
being his lackey. I am not.

301
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,470
Mr. Palmer is very ill.

302
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,711
I won't let you harm him.

303
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:52,154
If you try anything,
anything at all, I'll kill you.

304
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:53,889
Am I clear?

305
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:13,077
Ms. Valders. As requested.

306
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:15,525
Ah, Ms. Valders.

307
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,603
I so admire your pluck.

308
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:21,475
Thinking you and who? A rat catcher?

309
00:28:21,505 --> 00:28:24,668
Could come here and... what?

310
00:28:24,735 --> 00:28:26,970
Dispense with me?

311
00:28:27,182 --> 00:28:30,524
The mind boggles at the
absurdity of the plan.

312
00:28:30,554 --> 00:28:33,853
But the ego behind it... audacious.

313
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:35,684
You lied to me.

314
00:28:36,926 --> 00:28:40,557
Did we have a deeper
transaction than I recall?

315
00:28:40,587 --> 00:28:44,921
- I bought you. You let me.
- Are you a vampire, too?

316
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:46,257
Hardly.

317
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,813
You wanted to bring the world down.
Wipe out the human race.

318
00:28:51,843 --> 00:28:54,010
Why would any rational person
want to do such a thing?

319
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,918
First, don't deny yourself due credit.

320
00:28:56,948 --> 00:29:00,667
You should be taking a bow.
You did exceptional work.

321
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,562
Truly. I couldn't have
done this without you.

322
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:09,119
Human DNA decays as we age.

323
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:14,042
Overtime, it frays and
it fails and we follow suit.

324
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:16,946
But, it's a code that can be rewritten.

325
00:29:16,976 --> 00:29:20,389
Rewrite the software and
you control the hardware.

326
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:23,882
The meat, muscle, and
tissue that is mankind.

327
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:24,832
To what end?

328
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:29,645
If hacking is about exploring
the limits of what is possible,

329
00:29:29,675 --> 00:29:31,739
then I am on the verge of achieving

330
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:35,419
what you would consider
the ultimate hack.

331
00:29:36,815 --> 00:29:38,843
Cheating death.

332
00:29:39,665 --> 00:29:41,254
Immortality?

333
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:43,162
Yes.

334
00:29:43,911 --> 00:29:46,194
- Well thanks for sharing.
- It's hard to be on the verge

335
00:29:46,224 --> 00:29:49,765
of something so exciting and not
share the good news with someone

336
00:29:49,795 --> 00:29:53,199
- and you are the perfect person.
- And how's that?

337
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:55,633
Well, who would listen
to you if you shared it?

338
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:58,235
You are insignificant.

339
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:01,235
You feel how invisible you are.

340
00:30:01,573 --> 00:30:04,765
That's why you did what you did for me.

341
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:08,305
- Am I right about that?
- Son of a bitch!

342
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:11,724
You... you asshole! Let go of me!

343
00:30:11,754 --> 00:30:14,619
You're the nothing. You.

344
00:30:15,203 --> 00:30:16,920
- We won't see her again.
- Get off me.

345
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,610
- No, sir. You will not.
- Get off me!

346
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,211
_

347
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:35,633
Kelly...

348
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:08,834
Kelly...

349
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:11,570
Come to me...

350
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,565
Come to me...

351
00:31:40,704 --> 00:31:43,243
Come to me, Kelly.

352
00:31:54,421 --> 00:31:56,019
Kelly.

353
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,751
Come to me!

354
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,350
Look at me!

355
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,432
Rejoice!

356
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:20,408
Embrace your glorious fate.

357
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:27,131
Hey, Mr. Charming, remind me
to ignore you next time.

358
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:30,563
Sure, next time I will.
We'll do it your way.

359
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:33,548
We'll shout, yell, shoot our way in.

360
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:35,689
Yeah, well I had a better chance.

361
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:37,270
Stop.

362
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:41,518
Turn around.

363
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:56,706
Relax.

364
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,442
I'm letting you go.

365
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:06,052
My employer is... misguided.

366
00:33:06,082 --> 00:33:08,451
Misguided is not the
bloody word I would use.

367
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,092
I don't agree with what he's doing,

368
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:12,459
so I can hardly carry out an order

369
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:15,658
to kill the people who
are trying to make it right.

370
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,129
Won't your friends here tell on you?

371
00:33:19,643 --> 00:33:21,898
Their loyalty is to me.

372
00:33:22,307 --> 00:33:24,535
Then why don't you all join us?

373
00:33:24,565 --> 00:33:26,694
Help us make this right.

374
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:29,154
Go.

375
00:33:29,794 --> 00:33:31,711
While you have a chance.

376
00:33:43,198 --> 00:33:44,422
Go.

377
00:33:58,877 --> 00:34:00,429
Diane?

378
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:25,670
The only way to ensure
we're right is go down there.

379
00:37:36,841 --> 00:37:39,805
It's night. I was worried.

380
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:44,919
Nothing.

381
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,701
Guess we're not the only
ones that struck out, huh?

382
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,820
- No luck with the wife, huh?
- Oh, you're still here?

383
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:00,668
Who invited you here, exactly?

384
00:38:00,698 --> 00:38:01,915
Hey!

385
00:38:04,344 --> 00:38:06,774
She's here just the rest of us.

386
00:38:06,804 --> 00:38:07,967
Who put you in charge?

387
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:11,238
The director of the Centres for
Disease Control put me in charge.

388
00:38:11,268 --> 00:38:12,959
You know what?

389
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:14,756
I don't need this shit.

390
00:38:14,786 --> 00:38:18,135
If you don't want me, that's
absolutely no problem. I am gone.

391
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:21,211
Hey, hey, hey. It's not his decision.

392
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:24,648
Alright? Just ignore him.
He doesn't speak for all of us.

393
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:29,772
It's too dangerous. At least
just wait 'til morning.

394
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:33,138
I would rather take
my chances out there

395
00:38:33,168 --> 00:38:35,668
than be stuck in here with you assholes.

396
00:38:43,036 --> 00:38:44,333
Great.

397
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,889
You got a better deal
out there, be my guest.

398
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Dad?

399
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:58,175
- Hey, buddy.
- Did you find Mom?

400
00:39:02,343 --> 00:39:06,273
Dr. Goodweather, Nora
and I were just about

401
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:09,060
- to go over what we discovered...
- Just a minute.

402
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:32,200
You... didn't find her?

403
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:42,078
No. Look, I uh... I did find her phone.

404
00:39:43,118 --> 00:39:45,127
I guess she lost it.

405
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:48,086
What does that mean?

406
00:39:51,684 --> 00:39:53,657
I'm not giving up, Zack.

407
00:39:58,176 --> 00:40:00,550
Maybe this is why she hasn't called.

408
00:40:07,426 --> 00:40:09,728
- 1230.
- I know it.

409
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,967
It was the street address
at our place in Philly

410
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,079
when I was at medical school.

411
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:23,339
First place we bought together.

412
00:41:01,056 --> 00:41:02,175
Keep going!

413
00:41:03,757 --> 00:41:04,914
Keep going.

414
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,018
- Keep going!
- Come on!

415
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:17,853
- It's what you wanted, right?
- Mom, seriously?

416
00:41:19,431 --> 00:41:21,513
- Back deck.
- What?

417
00:41:21,543 --> 00:41:23,851
Check the back deck.

418
00:41:30,027 --> 00:41:31,520
Surprise!

419
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:34,919
- Do you like it?
- I love it!

420
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:39,328
- I got you good, didn't I?
- Yeah.

421
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,444
- Happy birthday, Z.
- Thanks so much.

422
00:41:42,474 --> 00:41:45,401
You're the best mom, ever!
I love the blue.

423
00:41:45,997 --> 00:41:48,510
It's exactly what I wanted...

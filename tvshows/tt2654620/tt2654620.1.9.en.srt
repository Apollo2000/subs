1
00:00:00,274 --> 00:00:01,983
Previously on The Strain...

2
00:00:02,013 --> 00:00:04,017
I'm the only one who could
slow the Internet down

3
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:05,299
to worse than dial up.

4
00:00:05,329 --> 00:00:06,359
You're hired.

5
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:07,847
We need to get Zack out
of the city right now.

6
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:08,822
Go to your mother's in Vermont.

7
00:00:08,852 --> 00:00:11,349
- What hell are you talking about?
- Something awful is happening.

8
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:12,938
If there's such a big emergency,

9
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:14,782
why isn't there any news about it?

10
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:15,940
You called the FBI?

11
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,005
- Take it easy, Doctor.
- OK, Doc. Stop right there. Uh?

12
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:20,965
No, you shut your mouth
and you listen to me.

13
00:00:20,995 --> 00:00:25,032
I invited you in, you are a guest,
and you need to start acting like one.

14
00:00:25,062 --> 00:00:27,046
We got inventory tonight
and it's going to go late.

15
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:28,513
I won't wait up.

16
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:32,638
Jeff, what happened?

17
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,057
Hey! Did you do this?!

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,746
Jim, what happened?

19
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:43,011
Scraped it when she knocked me down.

20
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:44,432
Close your eyes.

21
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,224
I think you got nicked. It's a worm.

22
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,977
- Oh God.
- You have to kill me.

23
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,291
Once I turn, I'm going
to go after them, right?

24
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:52,458
The ones you love.

25
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:54,896
Release him. Do it now,
before it's too late!

26
00:00:54,926 --> 00:00:56,177
No!

27
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:57,117
Oh!

28
00:00:57,147 --> 00:00:58,026
Ahh!

29
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,615
OK. Will you tell your mom
to call me, OK?

30
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:08,692
- None of this texting shit.
- OK.

31
00:01:08,722 --> 00:01:11,173
Maybe her phone broke or she lost it.

32
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:13,376
I left her a lot of messages,
normally she calls me

33
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,878
- to tell me how annoying I am.
- Maybe the battery died,

34
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:17,678
sometimes she forgets to charge it.

35
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:21,071
My God, with the noise all day!
The cops, helicopters...

36
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:24,224
I don't know what's going on.
Hey, hey. Honey, honey.

37
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:26,293
Are you sure Matt's home?
You know, it's looking

38
00:01:26,323 --> 00:01:29,398
- kind of dark in there.
- Look, mom. There he is.

39
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:31,964
Alright, alright.
You go quickly, it's cold.

40
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:35,018
My God, what'd you got
in there? A dead dog?

41
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:37,404
You tell her to call me
even though I'm pissed off.

42
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:39,703
- OK.
- OK, darling. Have a good one.

43
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:40,838
Bye.

45
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:51,834
Mom?

46
00:01:57,087 --> 00:01:59,715
Mom? Matt?

47
00:02:01,457 --> 00:02:03,458
That's my place right there.

48
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:10,903
What happened to the house?

49
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:16,472
Mom?

50
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,118
Oh, my God!

51
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:29,481
For your protection.

52
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:32,504
- Just in case.
- Measures to address

53
00:02:32,588 --> 00:02:34,508
the unrest in New York City.
The legislators are reluctant...

54
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:35,737
You OK?

55
00:02:36,543 --> 00:02:39,138
- I don't know.
- Be right back.

56
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:42,640
Leave me alone!

57
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:47,254
Zack, get down!

58
00:02:54,727 --> 00:02:55,868
Hurry!

59
00:03:09,404 --> 00:03:12,600
No, get down! Stay away
from his body. Are you OK?

60
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,885
- Are you bleeding?
- I don't think so.

61
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:16,467
Where's your mother? Did
you talk to your mother?

62
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:19,945
I don't know, I just got home
and that's when he attacked me.

63
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:32,751
Who was that?

64
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:36,769
- My ex-wife's boyfriend.
- Not anymore.

65

- corrections & sync by wolfen -
- www.addic7ed.com -

66
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,414
We should search the house.

67
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,260
- OK.
- Is there a basement?

68
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,082
If my wife is down there, nothing happens

69
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:15,296
when my son's here. Understand?

70
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:17,155
Fair enough.

71
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:20,176
- I'll search upstairs.
- Did you hear me?

72
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:25,664
- Loud and clear.
- Hey.

73
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:28,415
Where would I find some booze?

74
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:30,953
I don't live here anymore.

75
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:37,850
- Ah!
- Dad, what's happening?

76
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:40,496
This is part of the epidemic

77
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:43,937
we've been investigating.
Matt was infected.

78
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:46,106
Now I need you to tell me,
when was the last time you heard

79
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,782
- from your mother?
- This morning.

80
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:51,163
They were arguing about you because
you told us to go to Vermont.

81
00:04:51,193 --> 00:04:52,536
Matt thought that was stupid,

82
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:54,664
he didn't even come home last night.

83
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:57,816
Did you do that to Matt's face?

84
00:04:57,846 --> 00:05:00,246
No. He was like that when I got here.

85
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,503
He was wounded in another fight.

86
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,588
- Use your inhaler.

87
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:07,890
Just relax.

88
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:10,997
The house is empty.

89
00:05:19,204 --> 00:05:21,514
You understand that if
the worst has happened

90
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:23,773
your wife will return for her son.

91
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,767
We should take him from here, quickly.

92
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:26,862
Yep.

93
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:30,934
And you must get rid of that body.

94
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:32,636
How?

95
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:35,251
We burn it.

96
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:47,250
Ah.

97
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:52,352
I never felt so sick in my whole life.

98
00:05:54,482 --> 00:05:57,080
This asshole promised me a doctor.

99
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:00,647
How many times I gotta tell
you to get a doctor in here?

100
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:03,357
This some illegal shit. We got rights!

101
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:06,968
Look at him man, he's dying.

102
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,214
You hear me?

103
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:14,147
He's not the only one suffering. 
A lot of guys are coming in here sick.

104
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,934
The city system for first
responders is messed up.

105
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:18,314
This is bullshit!

106
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:21,033
If there's such an emergency, why
don't y'all bring more doctors in here?

107
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:22,102
Settle down, we've got

108
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,632
a transport van out back to take
you to Rikers in a few minutes.

109
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:26,592
No, no, no. We not going nowhere

110
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:27,703
until he sees a doctor.

111
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:29,701
He's not going to make it to no Rikers.

112
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:32,962
If you want your friend to stay
alive, get his ass on the van.

113
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,804
There's a doctor who checks
every new arrival at intake.

114
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,526
Elizalde, Williams,

115
00:06:38,556 --> 00:06:41,496
Orlando, Riley. Up and at 'em.

116
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:44,975
C'mon. We gonna get you 
some help. Let's go.

117
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:48,122
Hey, yo. Help me get him up.

118
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,625
Alright.

119
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:56,932
On three. One, two, three.

120
00:06:59,281 --> 00:07:01,820
Help me, Gus!

121
00:07:02,585 --> 00:07:05,857
- I'm here. I'm right here, OK?
- Gracias, hermano.

122
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:07,308
I know you do.

123
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,786
- How did you get out of jail?
- I escaped.

124
00:07:10,816 --> 00:07:13,777
From the FBI? For real?

125
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:16,751
Yeah. I saw an opening and I took it.

126
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,928
I shouldn't have been
arrested to begin with.

127
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,702
I didn't do anything wrong.

128
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:25,867
- Careful. This is warmer.
- Where did you get that dagger?

129
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:28,650
From Mr. Setrakian, the
older man from downstairs.

130
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,467
He's helping us out.

131
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:34,224
Now listen, Zack, I have to
stay here and fix the place up.

132
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,206
Your mom will flip if
she sees it like this.

133
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:38,537
- OK.
- Mr. Setrakian will take you to

134
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:41,363
his pawn shop. That's where I've
been hiding out. I trust him.

135
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:44,119
He'll protect you and
I'll be right behind.

136
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:46,728
Nothing will stop me from getting there.

137
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,928
OK.

138
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:54,239
What about Mom, Dad? Did
something happen to her?

139
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:00,912
I don't know where your mom
is but I'm going to find her.

140
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,615
Your mom's a survivor.

141
00:08:06,415 --> 00:08:08,789
You want some?

142
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:11,641
I had some bread.

143
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:14,780
Can I get you something?

144
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:22,398
You know, if we had handled your
friend the way you wanted to,

145
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:25,563
we'd all be dead.

146
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:28,221
There is no hope for
those who are infected.

147
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:32,344
- You must understand this.
- You don't know everything.

148
00:08:32,374 --> 00:08:37,996
- No, but I do know about this.
- I did what needed to be done.

149
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:41,357
- He's right.
- Nobody's asking you.

150
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:48,460
How would you have handled it, hm?

151
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:51,370
Teach me something.

152
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:56,980
If someone was going to help him die,

153
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,119
it should have been one of us.

154
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:01,546
Someone who loved him.

155
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:03,302
Oh.

156
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,125
But you weren't ready to do it.

157
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:14,994
I can't teach you how to be 
a human being.

158
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:20,142
Eat your bologna.

159
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,782
Well if we're about done here, 
I'd love a ride home.

160
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:32,574
- We're done. I'll drop you.
- Then we go to my shop.

161
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:37,547
I have things there... To
plan for our next battle.

162
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:43,796
Weiter! Weiter!

163
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:45,483
Schneller!

164
00:09:45,513 --> 00:09:48,161
Schenller! Schneller! Schneller!

165
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:20,594
Zack is going back with you.
I'll meet you in an hour.

166
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:24,472
I'm trusting you with him.
Please... take good care of him.

167
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,794
- Of course.
- I'm trusting you.

168
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:29,011
Yes, I know. My hearing is excellent.

169
00:10:29,272 --> 00:10:32,364
I'm staying, too. We'll
get it done faster.

170
00:10:35,463 --> 00:10:38,802
- Hey, I'm Fet.
- Zack.

171
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:50,330
Maybe it's weird to say, but...

172
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:52,390
it hurt me, too.

173
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:55,294
Seeing that happen to your friend.

174
00:10:55,677 --> 00:10:57,816
Even if it was the only way.

175
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:00,373
Sorry.

176
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,868
Hey.

177
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:12,412
Don't let the cops get you again.

178
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:14,743
The cops are very busy,
they don't have time for me.

179
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:20,986
When Mom comes back, tell her
I'm mad and Diane is mad, too.

180
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,613
You first. Go on.

181
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,233
Thanks for the lift!
It's been a real blast.

182
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:54,929
I'm coming up with you,
to make sure it's safe.

183
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,376
Fine. I'm not making out with you, though.

184
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:10,393
Nikki?

185
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:14,080
Nikki?!

186
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:20,599
No, no, no, no...

187
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,801
No, no, no...

188
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:24,988
Bitch.

189
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:27,718
Nikki I'm going to kill you!

190
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:43,839
Shit, she stole my backup!

191
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:56,852
Nikki, the girl I was with
at the store, she um...

192
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,181
stole all my money.

193
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:02,621
Every last penny that I had.

194
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:04,864
This is why I don't have roommates.

195
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:09,238
Yeah that, and 'cause you're 40.

196
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:13,264
We were more than roommates.

197
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,071
We were very close.

198
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,412
This is why I don't have friends.

199
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:23,846
She took my laptop. Everything
I have is on my laptop.

200
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:27,268
Maybe, um... She thought you were dead.

201
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:29,491
That's even worse!

202
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:37,843
All... the bloody... ugly...

203
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:41,847
shit that you love! Ah!!!

204
00:13:58,213 --> 00:13:59,969
Come up here, son.

205
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,454
... federal officials
tomorrow to ask that the city

206
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:07,622
be declared a disaster area.

207
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,790
- What's the matter?
- My mother's going to be upset

208
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,838
about her boyfriend, Matt, being dead.

209
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:33,824
I... I know you'll find
this hard to believe,

210
00:14:33,854 --> 00:14:38,650
but Matt came after you
because he loved you.

211
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:41,416
Why did you call him a vampire?

212
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:44,470
Because that's... what he turned into.

213
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:50,165
- My dad didn't use that word.
- He will. Trust me.

214
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:53,818
There's power in naming things.

215
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,004
He was so mad at me.

216
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:00,976
No, no, no. He... he was hungry.

217
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:04,813
Like a rabid animal. No different.

218
00:15:04,897 --> 00:15:07,496
Beloved dogs turn on you after

219
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:09,901
they've been bitten by a fox or...

220
00:15:09,931 --> 00:15:13,071
a bat or any infected animal.

221
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:19,116
Think of it as rabies being
passed from human to human.

222
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,580
Mourn Matt's passing, then move on.

223
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:27,014
Life will insist.

224
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,666
You mustn't...

225
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:31,293
fail life.

226
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:45,457
Die Juden...

227
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:01,319
A230385!

228
00:16:08,107 --> 00:16:10,115
What are you doing in here?

229
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:22,326
You are bereft after finishing 
that superb project.

230
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:26,243
Yes.

231
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:29,669
I've read artists are afflicted that way.

232
00:16:30,564 --> 00:16:33,652
The emptiness that
follows when a great thing

233
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:36,571
has been completed. The fear...

234
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:38,893
that you will never be
able to replicate it.

235
00:16:41,494 --> 00:16:44,751
Perhaps you are correct,
Herr Standartenfuhrer.

236
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:53,222
What will become of us?

237
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,560
For now, you will rejoin the others.

238
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:08,303
You OK?

239
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:11,832
- Yeah.
- I'm going to go.

240
00:17:13,171 --> 00:17:15,894
Ronnie, not now, OK?

241
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,447
The boy smokes so much
weed, his brain is fried.

242
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,449
Ronnie, this isn't your apartment.

243
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:27,244
- Ronnie?
- Move!

244
00:17:34,947 --> 00:17:37,329
Oh! This was handy.

245
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:42,521
You can't stay here.
This building's infected.

246
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:45,285
- He was like another brother...
- No, no, no, no.

247
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,009
Stay away from the body, alright?

248
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:52,455
Look at me. You go grab some
clothes, then we're going to go.

249
00:17:52,485 --> 00:17:55,980
Yeah? You alright? Go.

250
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:13,561
We've been waiting.

251
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:15,620
We'd be gone had you left the keys.

252
00:18:15,671 --> 00:18:18,289
Which is why I didn't.

253
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:22,169
- It wasn't good in there.
- Were there vampires?

254
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:23,849
Yeah.

255
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:26,744
Well then we best get moving.

256
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,390
I assume she's coming with us.

257
00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:36,659
- She's coming with us.
- Right then, well then.

258
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:40,164
Since you've decided, let's go!

259
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:55,579
You think this is funny?! 
Leaving me here!

260
00:18:56,622 --> 00:18:59,361
Who are these people?

261
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,005
I'm not cooking for them!

262
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:05,094
Nora's mother.

263
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:07,442
- Obviously.
- Come.

264
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,100
Close the door.

265
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:33,064
- Whoa!
- My God, it's like the Batcave.

266
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:50,131
Read and learn. It will, uh...

267
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:52,698
It will help you.

268
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:56,771
You saw this coming, huh?

269
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:59,249
I hoped it wouldn't.

270
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:05,322
There must be humans helping this cause.

271
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,067
Do you know who they are?

272
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:11,107
No, but I can speculate.

273
00:20:11,137 --> 00:20:14,677
Those who are seduced 
by the promise of...

274
00:20:14,707 --> 00:20:16,560
power and who...

275
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:21,207
yearn to leave a mark that
will somehow elevate them.

276
00:20:21,814 --> 00:20:24,186
They inadvertently hurt

277
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:28,930
many people, but inadvertent
or not, the damage is done.

278
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:33,725
- May I?
- Sure.

279
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:41,574
We can get the Master, the
one responsible for all this

280
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:46,069
but I need your help.
You're... unsentimental.

281
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:50,770
Precise. Not ruled by your emotions.

282
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:55,770
- I have feelings.
- Leave the feeling to others.

283
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:09,299
He's nesting. Somewhere in the city.

284
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:11,221
You know New York.

285
00:21:11,251 --> 00:21:12,977
We could find him

286
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:15,424
if we work together.

287
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:19,157
I'm going home to get a few things.

288
00:21:19,975 --> 00:21:21,870
I'll be back.

289
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:39,008
Do you think Kelly did that to his face?

290
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:40,173
I do.

291
00:21:40,747 --> 00:21:42,191
And I hope she got away.

292
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:44,486
Where the hell is she?

293
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:50,503
She could be anywhere.

294
00:21:54,321 --> 00:21:58,213
Maybe Matt scared her and
she's hiding somewhere.

295
00:22:03,817 --> 00:22:05,411
You know in Argentina,
you inherit the dread

296
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:07,941
of things turning upside-down overnight.

297
00:22:08,885 --> 00:22:10,751
Just like this.

298
00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:15,325
- People disappeared.
- This isn't Argentina.

299
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:17,816
She's not disappeared.

300
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,096
My son isn't growing up without a mother.

301
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:54,536
I can't believe Jim is gone.

302
00:22:54,884 --> 00:22:57,744
He was the kindest man I knew.

303
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,831
Always generous. Always.

304
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:13,927
When he lifted up his
shirt and I saw his back,

305
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:16,948
that was the worst moment of my life.

306
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,543
This is the weirdest memorial ever.

307
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:25,421
Should we say something about...

308
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:26,926
Matt.

309
00:23:30,085 --> 00:23:31,176
No.

310
00:23:38,143 --> 00:23:41,609
Back at the store you said
the vampires were targeting us.

311
00:23:42,426 --> 00:23:44,826
- Is that true?
- It is.

312
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:48,428
These are coordinated assaults;

313
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:55,410
disabling methods of communication,
the Internet, cellphones,

314
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:57,675
they're all part of it.

315
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:59,506
Making sure people don't

316
00:23:59,536 --> 00:24:01,501
put the pieces together.

317
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:04,619
Do you know who Eldritch Palmer is?

318
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:08,188
One of the most powerful
men in the world, yes.

319
00:24:08,218 --> 00:24:09,668
He hired me.

320
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,440
To do what?

321
00:24:13,249 --> 00:24:15,925
I thought it was about corporate bullshit

322
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,355
and greed about making him more money.

323
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:21,764
What did you do?

324
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:26,525
I worked my ass off to
shut the Internet down.

325
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:33,629
You disrupted communication
on behalf of Eldritch Palmer?

326
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,753
Me and my hacker group, yeah.

327
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:41,222
Now I had malware in the city's
top four fibre optic centres.

328
00:24:41,553 --> 00:24:44,786
Crashed the shit out of those.
Plus Twitter and Facebook

329
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,082
and a big chunk of the
deep web. Now, normal people

330
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,412
don't even know what that is, but...

331
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,660
it's all dark now.

332
00:24:55,934 --> 00:24:57,701
Well, I uh...

333
00:24:58,692 --> 00:25:00,675
I appreciate your honestly.

334
00:25:00,926 --> 00:25:03,937
Yeah, I was feeling so superior.

335
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,781
Like I'd gotten one over
on those bloody assholes.

336
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:12,469
Took all their money.

337
00:25:13,772 --> 00:25:17,717
Which is now stolen 
from me. Deserve that.

338
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:20,859
I should've followed my instincts.

339
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:24,365
Did not like that plastic-faced freak.

340
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:27,204
Stomach dropped the moment I saw him.

341
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:31,792
Who's that?

342
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:35,931
With Palmer. Some German dude.

343
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:39,451
- We weren't introduced.
- Yes.

344
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,792
Can you undo what you've done?

345
00:25:45,862 --> 00:25:47,221
Well, isn't it too late for that?

346
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,775
We don't ever make that concession.

347
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:19,527
Agh!

348
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,842
Agh. Ah...

349
00:26:43,524 --> 00:26:44,806
Ah!

350
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,510
Abraham...

351
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:58,263
You have watched me for how many nights?

352
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:01,112
Eyes open, lying there.

353
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,946
Thinking I can't see you.

354
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:07,906
Agh...

355
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:10,948
After all this time,

356
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:14,731
is this the best you
could do to try to stop me?

357
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,530
- Oh God, please help me.
- Where is he?

358
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:23,484
Where is your God?

359
00:27:23,568 --> 00:27:25,119
I don't see him.

360
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:28,271
Ah! Ahh!

361
00:27:29,788 --> 00:27:34,414
There is no one to help you, wood carver.

362
00:27:46,072 --> 00:27:49,272
- You better swallow that shit.
- Mind your business.

363
00:27:51,307 --> 00:27:53,133
Give me some space, man!

364
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:58,436
When I get out of these cuffs,

365
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,760
I'm going to knock out whatever's left

366
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,925
of those rotten ass teeth
you got. You hear me?

367
00:28:03,786 --> 00:28:05,160
Bitch.

368
00:28:10,248 --> 00:28:12,491
Yo you alright, Felix?

369
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:15,078
Felix?

370
00:28:17,272 --> 00:28:19,423
Hey, cut the shit back there!

371
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:36,146
We have a male armed 
with a 9mm... caution.

372
00:28:39,447 --> 00:28:40,593
Yeah.

373
00:28:40,623 --> 00:28:43,173
I know I left you there for a long time.

374
00:28:44,232 --> 00:28:45,628
I'm sorry.

375
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:50,453
- Mama, tranquilizate por favor...

376
00:29:02,122 --> 00:29:03,757
She alright?

377
00:30:02,513 --> 00:30:05,035
This is dispatch.
Please respond.

378
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:07,693
Hurry up, man!

379
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,494
- I promised you.
- Do you need backup car 739?

380
00:30:10,524 --> 00:30:12,226
Assholes!

381
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:15,276
Nobody better move!

382
00:30:15,306 --> 00:30:17,054
- Help us, man! Help us!
- Shut up!

383
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:19,473
- Get us out of here, man! C'mon!
- Shut up!

384
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:21,523
- What's going on?!
- C'mon! What are you doing?!

385
00:30:26,665 --> 00:30:30,331
Get me outta here! Please!

386
00:30:42,906 --> 00:30:44,610
Shoot him!

387
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:47,080
- Shoot him!
- Shoot him!

388
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:49,393
Perdףname, hermano.

389
00:30:49,423 --> 00:30:51,480
Felix!

390
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:33,539
- Does my dad have the key?
- Yes.

391
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:35,667
I hope nothing happened to him.

392
00:31:35,697 --> 00:31:39,845
- Do you think he's on his way?
- He will be here, I promise you.

393
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:40,875
It...

394
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:46,099
It takes time to do what he has to do.

395
00:31:46,183 --> 00:31:47,883
What does he have to do?

396
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,491
Please, David. David, my fingers.

397
00:32:16,521 --> 00:32:19,421
Could you help straighten
them? Please, just... help?

398
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:22,752
- Did the guards do this to you?
- Yes, they caught me stealing bread

399
00:32:22,837 --> 00:32:24,506
and they crushed my
hands in the pantry door.

400
00:32:24,536 --> 00:32:26,724
- Please, just pull as hard as you can.
- OK.

401
00:32:26,754 --> 00:32:28,051
Agh!

402
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,196
Sorry.

403
00:32:29,226 --> 00:32:30,167
Ah!

404
00:32:33,496 --> 00:32:34,815
That group.

405
00:32:35,948 --> 00:32:37,522
You, this group.

406
00:32:38,308 --> 00:32:39,936
You, that group.

407
00:32:41,322 --> 00:32:42,505
That group.

408
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,540
- Are you not well?
- I'm fine.

409
00:32:47,618 --> 00:32:49,927
Do you hide something in your hands?

410
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:53,185
- No, sir.
- Show them to me.

411
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:29,524
This group.

412
00:33:29,554 --> 00:33:32,419
- Up, around!
- That group, now.

413
00:33:32,449 --> 00:33:35,358
- This group.
- Come on, that group.

414
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:38,193
Knien!

415
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,283
- It's your turn, go!
- I can't! I can't! I can't!

416
00:34:17,665 --> 00:34:20,996
Hey, hey! Pull him over, please!

417
00:34:21,674 --> 00:34:23,707
Please! Thank you, thank you.

418
00:34:29,722 --> 00:34:31,048
Agh!

419
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,635
Run, run! Come on!

420
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:00,315
Kelly, are you home?

421
00:35:02,854 --> 00:35:04,158
Oh! Oh!

422
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:06,916
What?! Are you freaking kidding me?!

423
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:08,845
What are you doing here? Where's Kelly?

424
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,645
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?!

425
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,297
Beyond the obvious.

426
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:15,697
Zack's not answering his
texts, Kelly's MIA all day.

427
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:17,297
I'm looking for her is
what I was doing here.

428
00:35:17,327 --> 00:35:19,528
- And who are you?
- Nora.

429
00:35:19,558 --> 00:35:21,987
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah. OK. You're Nora.

430
00:35:22,017 --> 00:35:23,872
Yeah, Kelly's told me a lot about you.

431
00:35:23,902 --> 00:35:27,270
You two work together,
right? Where's Zack, Eph?

432
00:35:27,321 --> 00:35:30,221
- He's fine, he's with my colleagues.
- It's not safe here.

433
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:32,345
She's serious. You have to get
out of town as soon as possible.

434
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:34,486
Oh yeah. This is amazing.

435
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:37,025
Right, right. In all your concerned state,

436
00:35:37,055 --> 00:35:39,130
you still find time to screw on the rug.

437
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,060
This is important, Diane. If
you hear from her, call me.

438
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:49,408
That's Nora's number.
I lost my phone. Please.

439
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,443
Hey.

440
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,827
You hurt my friend,

441
00:35:52,857 --> 00:35:55,610
I will cut your heart out. 
Just so you know.

442
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,452
I love my wife. She's
the mother of my son.

443
00:35:59,482 --> 00:36:01,749
I'd do anything to find her.

444
00:36:03,157 --> 00:36:06,015
Yeah. OK.

445
00:36:15,398 --> 00:36:16,911
We should go. Your son's waiting for you.

446
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,441
Yeah, she's definitely calling the cops.

447
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,920
Don't forget your dagger.

448
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,444
New York City emergency 
rooms are swamped

449
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:38,147
with patients complaining
of flu-like symptoms.

450
00:36:38,215 --> 00:36:41,550
Doctors have been unable
to identify the cause of...

451
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:43,719
Refuse to speculate on
whether it may be related

452
00:36:43,804 --> 00:36:46,274
to the rising acts of...

453
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,004
Ah, good.

454
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:53,112
- You're back.
- I'm back.

455
00:36:56,233 --> 00:36:58,350
Did Mr. Setrakian take good care of you?

456
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,810
Yeah. Did you burn Matt's body?

457
00:37:08,237 --> 00:37:09,863
Yes, I did.

458
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,798
Did you hear anything from Mom?

459
00:37:11,828 --> 00:37:12,828
No.

460
00:37:15,978 --> 00:37:17,036
Um...

461
00:37:17,816 --> 00:37:21,843
Diane came by the house.
Couldn't tell her about Matt.

462
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:25,376
- She must be mad.
- She wasn't happy.

463
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:29,588
- She's not my biggest fan.
- She makes Mom laugh.

464
00:37:29,618 --> 00:37:31,106
That's good.

465
00:37:39,403 --> 00:37:41,601
So... Mom?

466
00:37:43,071 --> 00:37:44,663
First thing tomorrow.

467
00:37:44,693 --> 00:37:48,103
- Maybe I can help, too?
- Of course.

468
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:51,829
We're a team.

469
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:30,049
Rgh!

470
00:40:51,386 --> 00:40:54,620
Why have you forsaken me?

471
00:41:29,703 --> 00:41:32,143
I have done everything you asked.

472
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,847
Yes, Herr Eichhorst. You have.

473
00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:42,346
I'm ready.

474
00:41:42,611 --> 00:41:45,587
Then it is time.

475
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:54,014
To a new order.

476
00:42:06,176 --> 00:42:08,176
Ah! Ah!

477
00:42:08,206 --> 00:42:10,837
Ah! Ah! Ah!

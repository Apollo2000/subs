00:00:01,756 --> 00:00:03,936
You know, I was getting on the subway
today and I did see,

3
00:00:03,966 --> 00:00:06,121
like, 10 rats on the platform.

4
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:09,274
Rats don't migrate like that.
Something was driving them out

5
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:10,503
- of their nest.
- Like what?

6
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:12,591
A bigger predator.
Oh, shit.

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,143
Oh God!
We were talking about

8
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:21,187
- finding a cure.
- That was before we knew

9
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:23,856
- how quickly it spread.
- But this isn't my home.

10
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,390
I'll lie down with you
until you fall asleep.

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,100
What's going on?

12
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:32,403
- We have to go! Come on!
- What?

13
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:35,634
We need to lock down anyone
related to the plane casualties.

14
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:39,405
I have empirical proof that
the victims are returning home

15
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:42,580
and infecting their families.
They have you on video

16
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,594
dragging Redfern's body
down the hallway.

17
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:46,424
I have to get out of here.

18
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:50,366
Drop your phone,
I'll see what I can do.

Kelly Goodweather?
I'm special agent Monroe,

54
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,440
this is special agent
Woodbridge. FBI.

55
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:46,122
- OK.
- We're looking for your husband

56
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:48,599
Dr. Ephraim Goodweather.
Is he here by any chance?

57
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:53,298
- No. Um, we're separated.
- Oh, sorry to hear that.

58
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:55,621
We've been having trouble
reaching him...

59
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,716
Well, do you know where he is
right now or how we can

60
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:05,415
get in contact with him?

61
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:08,321
I... I have his phone number.

62
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:10,801
Yeah, no. His cellphone
has gone dark.

63
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,751
Wait, is Eph OK? Does this
have something to do

64
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:15,942
- with the airplane?
- It does, yeah.

65
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:19,879
- What's going on?
- FBI. I'm agent Monroe

66
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:21,814
and this is agent Woodbridge.

67
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:25,201
We're looking for Ephraim Goodweather.
And you are?

68
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:28,871
Matt Sayles, Kelly's boyfriend.
What's the matter?

69
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:30,642
You know what, Matt,
I've got it. If you want to go

70
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:33,197
check on Zack. Make sure
he doesn't wander over.

71
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:35,761
If Dr. Goodweather gets
in touch with either one of you,

72
00:04:35,763 --> 00:04:38,230
we'd appreciate it if you
contacted us immediately.

73
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,016
If you don't mind, I have
to get my son off to school.

74
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,976
- You think he's in there?
- With his wife's boyfriend

75
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:53,679
in the house? Eh, not a chance.

76
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,897
Can only be Thursday, can it?

77
00:04:57,927 --> 00:05:00,063
- You jammed up to?
- Office's so flooded

78
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:02,172
with calls, we're referring
business to the competition,

79
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,894
- who're too busy to take it.
- I know, you dope.

80
00:05:04,924 --> 00:05:07,790
I'm the competition.
Something's going on.

81
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:10,801
One of the mafia... 'Scuse me,

82
00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:12,032
the sanitation department,

83
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,830
forget to do their trash
pick-up this week?

84
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,801
I was on a roof in Mott haven
yesterday, a whole squad

85
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:17,627
of munchers livin' up there,
like pigeons.

86
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:19,002
Yeah, I saw them pourin' out
of a sewer in

87
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:22,974
morning-side heights. Hundreds.
Like somethin' biblical.

88
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,418
It's a mass displacement.

89
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,016
Something's driving them out
from underground.

90
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:34,971
- How you know this, Fet?
- I seen 'em. In the tunnels.

91
00:05:35,272 --> 00:05:38,471
- Seen what?
- Something big.

92
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:41,313
And it's hiding down there
in the dark.

93
00:05:41,343 --> 00:05:44,247
- What? The mole people?
- Ha! Ha! Ha!

94
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,339
You'd be happy to see the mole people
instead of these things.

95
00:05:51,023 --> 00:05:53,172
What'd they look like?

96
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:11,691
Fsh... I'm just saying
be careful, that's all.

97
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,960
Hey, Fet.
Next time you see 'em,

98
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:17,229
- thank 'em for all the overtime.
- Yeah. Ha! Ha!

99
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:19,398
<i>Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha!</i>

- Oh!

102
00:06:29,553 --> 00:06:32,244
- Is this boring or what?
- Didn't come here to pitty-pat.

103
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:36,818
Pretty boy, I never
liked you anyway.

104
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,356
- Now you hurt my feelings.
- Uh oh!

105
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:46,268
My ride here?

106
00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:48,866
It is. I'm here for Mr. Elizalde.

107
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:53,974
Pitty-pat that.

108
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:01,391
- With who? The queen?
- Mr. Eichhorst.

109
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:03,909
Nah, I don't work
for him no more.

110
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,150
You'd better step up out of here,
home boy.

111
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,477
I'm afraid he insists.

112
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:19,394
Alright, man.
Be easy with that heat, eh?

113
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:23,096
Let me get cleaned up.
Felix.

114
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:29,291
- What's up?
- This guy I used to work for.

115
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:34,429
Putting the press on me. We gon' end
that shit today, though.

116
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:37,343
What did those men want?

117
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:40,837
- Nothing.
- Is dad in trouble?

118
00:07:41,196 --> 00:07:43,683
- Why do you ask?
- 'Cause he's on TV.

<i>Redfern apparently went missing last night from St.
Sebastian's hospital...</i>

125
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:01,607
Whatever they're saying,
it's completely bogus.

126
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:07,078
We need to get Zack out
of the city right now.

127
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:08,530
- Go to your mother's in Vermont.
- Wait... what the hell

128
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,814
- are you talking about?
- Something awful is happening.

129
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:14,910
Um... the contagion. It's a terrible
disease, an outbreak.

130
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,178
It's burning its way through
the city and they're trying

131
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,857
to make sure nobody'll listen to me.

132
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:23,610
- Is it that bad?
- How did you get in here?

133
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:28,081
Just... just pack a bag.
Throw some clothes in, get out.

134
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:30,145
- Look, you're scaring me.
- I'm scared.

135
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:33,822
I've never seen anything like this.
Nobody has. If there's some big emergency

136
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:36,886
why isn't there any news about it?
Why isn't the government warning us

137
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:39,936
- instead of looking for you.
- They're trying to turn it around on me.

138
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:43,272
Look, I know too much.

139
00:08:43,302 --> 00:08:45,739
- Maybe that sounds crazy.
- You gotta get rid of your phone, dad.

140
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:47,534
They can use it to trace you.

141
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:50,110
- I did that already.
- Go upstairs and get ready for school.

142
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,952
Upstairs, Zack.

143
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:55,538
You're scaring me and you're going
to scare your son.

144
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,580
Is it the custody hearing? I mean,
have you finally snapped?

145
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,494
How many drinks have you had
this morning, Eph?

146
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,104
You know me Kelly.
You need to do this.

147
00:09:06,134 --> 00:09:08,420
Look, you need to stop
giving me orders, OK?

148
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,085
Besides, how many times have you
said "you can't outrun a virus"?

149
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:13,472
Well this one,
you need to try.

150
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:16,709
Look, I wouldn't be saying this
if it wasn't important!

151
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:19,100
You can take my office,
you can tear it down,

152
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,069
you can turn it into a game
room, I don't give a shit.

153
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:24,567
But this matters.

154
00:09:25,373 --> 00:09:28,577
- You called the FBI?
- Goddamn fool.

155
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:32,084
Take it easy, doctor.
Put your hands behind your head.

156
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:34,758
- OK, doc. Stop right there, eh?
- My God, Eph.

157
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:36,635
We just have a few questions
for you.

158
00:09:36,885 --> 00:09:38,851
Put your hands
behind your head!

159
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,325
Run.

160
00:09:57,235 --> 00:09:58,572
They left with him in the backseat.

161
00:09:58,602 --> 00:10:00,631
I don't think any of the
neighbours noticed anything.

162
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:02,606
- Why did you do that?
- What?

163
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:05,108
Call the FBI
as they instructed us to do?

164
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,725
What? You want us to be
an accessory to whatever?

165
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:10,814
- It wasn't your call to make.
- He forced his way into our house.

166
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:12,747
Into my house! My ex-husband.

167
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:14,968
And I will decide
how to deal with him.

168
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:17,206
Wow you... you're actually
defending him.

169
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:20,421
- Why did they arrest dad?
- You know what? It was just

170
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:22,592
a big misunderstanding and
we're going to sort it out.

171
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:27,164
- Are we going to Vermont?
- Know what? Maybe we should.

172
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,167
- Just to be safe.
- Are you kidding me? And do what?

173
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,698
You're just going
to pull Zack out of school?

174
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:35,682
And how are you going to find
a substitute for your class

175
00:10:35,712 --> 00:10:38,068
this late? I'm sorry,
but I'm not losing my job because

176
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:41,530
- your ex went crazy.
- Don't say that about him!

177
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,348
Zack, just go wait
in the car for me, OK?

178
00:10:45,673 --> 00:10:47,544
Look, I know you're upset.
With your history...

179
00:10:47,574 --> 00:10:49,308
No, you shut your mouth
and you listen to me.

180
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:52,439
This is my family, my life.
I invited you in, you are

181
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:55,917
a guest and you need to start
acting like one.

182
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,711
A guest?

183
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:02,226
Maybe this was a mistake.
Maybe I acted too quickly.

184
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:04,285
No no no. We know what we're
doing here, OK? I'm here.

185
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:07,454
I'm here because I love you.
I'm here

186
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:10,457
because I'm trying to protect
this family.

187
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,896
- We're way past me being a guest.
- I need to go to work.

188
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:19,711
- We're not done here!
- I am.

189
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,962
Fine. Fine, I gotta go
to work too.

190
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:25,706
- Great.
- Great.

191
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:30,744
We've inventory tonight
and it's gonna go late.

192
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:33,480
I won't wait up.

193

<i>Sabia mea fredonaza argint.</i>

194
00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:27,821
Agh... agh!

195
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:44,405
Grrr!

00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:47,568
Mama, are you OK?
Do you remember anything

198
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,689
from last night?

199
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:53,253
It... it was a lovely dinner.

200
00:15:54,363 --> 00:15:56,744
I wish I could forget
like you.

201
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:08,789
Hello?

202
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,501
I've been better.
Have you heard from Eph?

203
00:16:11,531 --> 00:16:14,004
He took Redfern's autopsy video

204
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:16,171
to Barnes who put
the FBI on him.

205
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:18,510
- Arrested?

206
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,535
Who's been arrested?

207
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,250
Don't they see what's
happening?

208
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,473
This doesn't make any sense.

209
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:30,352
Nora? Nora?!

210
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:31,548
Jim?

211
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:33,803
- Jim, I'm losing you. Don't!

212
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:38,361
- Mama, don't open the door!
- Nora! You're hurting me again.

213
00:16:38,391 --> 00:16:40,184
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:42,690
Are they making people disappear?

215
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,225
We have to go.

I'm out.

What do I gotta do
to convince you that I'm done?

238
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:36,343
Gus. You violated one of
the three rules.

239
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:39,316
You attempted to take
some of the cargo.

240
00:18:39,346 --> 00:18:42,465
The deal we made therefore
is no longer valid.

241
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:44,408
But you remain in my employ.

242
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:46,112
I didn't look in that box.

243
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:49,683
We're not going
to debate the issue.

244
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,852
Here is your new assignment:

245
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,287
In the basement
of St. Sebastian's hospital,

246
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:57,467
you will find the refrigerated
remains of a body.

247
00:18:57,632 --> 00:19:00,527
An associate will pick you up
and take you to this body.

248
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:04,130
You will remove it
from the hospital premises

249
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:06,271
and you will dispose of it.

250
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:11,145
I trust you know of a secure
location for such a task.

251
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:13,573
I don't think
you're hearing me.

you shoulda never
brought her into this.

258
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,198
You love her very much.

259
00:19:38,874 --> 00:19:41,768
What I find fascinating is
how love is considered a gift,

260
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:47,220
a blessing, with no acceptance
to the fact that it also binds

261
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:51,444
and chokes and strangles.

262
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:57,350
Shut up, fool. You're over!

263
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:19,800
Ah... argh.

264
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:23,376
- Yes?
- What are you?

265
00:20:30,651 --> 00:20:34,983
I am your salvation
or your downfall. Your choice.

266
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:38,792
You're a smart boy, Gus.
I doubt you will make

267
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:41,162
the same mistake again.

268
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:46,533
Now get going!

269
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:10,716
Everything you've been told is
100% false.

270
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:14,633
So you didn't kill
Doyle Redfern, the pilot?

271
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:18,794
No. I did not kill
Doyle Redfern the pilot.

272
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:22,854
Just happened to be dragging
his body down the hallway, is that right?

273
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:25,788
Look, could you text my son?

274
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:28,722
You handcuffed me right
in front of him.

275
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:32,915
You can type it in, I'll dictate it to you,
he just needs to know that I'm OK.

276
00:21:32,945 --> 00:21:36,329
Yeah, but I'm not sure that you are, doc.
In fact, I'm sure that you're not.

277
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:38,204
Now I'm not going to dick around
with you, you are in

278
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:41,361
a shit-storm of trouble here and the best
thing you can do for yourself

279
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:43,575
- is to tell me the truth.
- Look, I know that this is

280
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:46,449
the way that you do things but we really
just don't have time for this shit.

281
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:49,481
- That's all you got is time, fella.
- No, I don't. We don't.

282
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:52,647
These hours are crucial. We need
daylight to fight these things,

283
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:55,025
to hunt them.
What time is it?

284
00:21:55,612 --> 00:21:58,724
I don't give a shit who you
are or what fancy medical school

285
00:21:58,754 --> 00:22:01,586
you went to. Now I own you.

286
00:22:01,616 --> 00:22:03,330
Buzz me out.

287
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,657
Let's leave this asshole in here
for a day or two

288
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:07,257
and let him stew.

289
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:24,808
You?

290
00:22:37,515 --> 00:22:38,692
What's this?

291
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:41,162
Just put 'em on and don't talk to me.

292
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:45,256
Here you go, thanks.

293
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:51,276
- Cellphone's still out.
- Where are we going?

294
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:53,371
I don't know, mama.

295
00:22:54,349 --> 00:22:57,962
But it isn't safe here.
It'll be dark soon...

00:22:58,261 --> 00:23:02,311
<i>Don't be silly mi hija,

- OK.

305
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:58,877
You two hear about the house
explosion out in ozone park?

306
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:27,972
Didn't know you had
a little girl.

307
00:25:05,535 --> 00:25:09,013
Huh. Gonna need something
with a little more punch.

308
00:25:13,868 --> 00:25:18,790
Munchers sneaking in the enemy
headquarters, huh?

309
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:26,829
Boss?

310
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,045
You alright?

311
00:25:33,974 --> 00:25:36,941
Rah!

312
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:43,381
Rrgh! Yah!

313
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:48,796
Gah!

314
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,311
OK then.

315
00:26:18,918 --> 00:26:20,288
Lauretta...?

316
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,391
You were right.

317
00:26:58,421 --> 00:27:00,930
Shoulda waited a couple of days
instead of bringing him back in.

318
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,594
And hearing this bullshit.

319
00:27:02,596 --> 00:27:06,088
You wanted to hear the whole story,
that's it. I just gave it to you.

320
00:27:06,118 --> 00:27:08,533
All of it. It's the truth.

321
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:13,657
Well, not everything.
What about that guy?

322
00:27:13,687 --> 00:27:17,909
Peter bishop. Head of airport ATC,
found dead at JFK.

323
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:19,541
Was he also one of these
infected people

324
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:23,748
- who needed to be destroyed?
- How about just for one minute,

325
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,643
you entertain the possibility
that I'm right.

326
00:27:26,673 --> 00:27:30,589
That there is a massive contagious
event rolling through New York City.

327
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:32,086
OK.

328
00:27:33,614 --> 00:27:35,636
Well, just go to one
of the passenger's houses.

329
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:38,262
Just pick one, any one
and see what you find there.

330
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,876
Let's put this guy
back in his cell.

331
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,616
Goodbye doctor, we'll see you
in court in five or six months.

332
00:27:45,646 --> 00:27:48,765
Alright, alright, alright.
I...

333
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:52,097
I'll take you to the bodies.
I know where the bodies are.

334
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:00,182
Are you saying something
different now?

335
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,701
- I am.
- You know where the bodies are?

336
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:05,502
- I do. All of them.
- Give us an address.

337
00:28:05,532 --> 00:28:07,425
No, no, no. No address.
I need to show you.

338
00:28:07,455 --> 00:28:09,629
- It's just more bullshit.

339
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:12,281
No, no, no.
I want to make a deal.

340
00:28:15,463 --> 00:28:20,465
If you're jacking us around,
what I did to you before was nothing.

341
00:28:20,814 --> 00:28:22,040
You want answers to your questions

342
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:25,001
you're not going
to find them in here.

343
00:28:28,257 --> 00:28:32,219
As far as I'm concerned,
eclipse is French for happy hour.

344
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:36,279
I've just never
seen Eph like that.

345
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:40,175
It's a classic cock-block.
"Oh, there's just some big city...

346
00:28:40,205 --> 00:28:43,755
"Wide emergency, save yourself
and Zack, I'm your hero."

347
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:47,302
I mean, I just shut Matt down hard.

348
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:51,893
He was trying to help.
Failing, but trying.

349
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:54,230
Hey, what you did was fine.

350
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,636
They need to be put in
their place from time to time.

351
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:59,916
He hasn't called or texted,
I mean, that is so not like him.

352
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,227
That's male pride.

353
00:29:01,257 --> 00:29:03,382
You think this redecorating
thing is some random

354
00:29:03,412 --> 00:29:05,822
home improvement? You're lucky
he's not marking his territory

355
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:08,653
in a more traditional way.

356
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:12,757
Maybe I let him move in
too soon.

357
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:16,062
Maybe I did want to hurt Eph.

358
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:18,747
Hey. Divorce is a street fight.

359
00:29:18,777 --> 00:29:22,567
Don't you forget about Eph's
spicy side-dish there at work, OK?

360
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:24,468
- Stay strong.
- Right.

361
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:31,409
- And what if Eph's right?
- I don't know...

362
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:34,278
Then go to Vermont. Take a long
weekend if you're stressing out

363
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,215
about it. You don't have
to justify it you don't have to...

364
00:29:37,217 --> 00:29:40,184
You don't have to ask Matt's
permission. You go, you deserve it.

365
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:42,814
Right. What about you?

366
00:29:42,844 --> 00:29:45,483
You're not worried that there's
some horrible new epidemic

367
00:29:45,513 --> 00:29:47,985
they're not telling us about?

368
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:49,693
- You want to come with us?
- Nah!

369
00:29:50,074 --> 00:29:54,031
Kel, come on.
I'm a queens girl, we never leave.

370
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:09,135
Aw man, it's so loose
and nasty in there.

371
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:12,800
I'm telling you, someone got
their ass chopped up.

372
00:30:12,802 --> 00:30:16,004
Who is it? Mob guy? Politician?

373
00:30:16,006 --> 00:30:19,247
- You don't need to know.
- Leave it alone, Felix.

374
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:21,415
Nice try, homie.
I gotta see this.

375
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:24,779
Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Hey, what are you doing?!

376
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,770
That shit ain't human.

377
00:30:30,153 --> 00:30:31,615
Get out of the way!

378
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:47,669
Goddamnit.

379
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:51,239
Let's get this over with.

380
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:39,680
- Pop.
- Vassily.

381
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:50,804
- Mom's not home?
- She's on her way.

382
00:31:51,091 --> 00:31:53,735
Market day.

383
00:31:56,133 --> 00:32:00,505
Mmm... Pirozkhi.

384
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:04,092
Always. Fresh made, huh?

385
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:11,686
You need money?

386
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:16,791
Sorry to disappoint you.

387
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:23,194
Still the mad genius
I see, huh?

388
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:26,111
It is almost done.

389
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:32,367
<i>The history of Ukrainian
architecture.</i>

390
00:32:32,781 --> 00:32:35,977
Authored by a man who fled
the country 30 years ago

391
00:32:36,685 --> 00:32:39,414
- to never return.
- My book is to be published

392
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:43,718
in June by the Odessa Mechnikov
University press.

393
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:48,106
I have also been invited
to lecture there in Odessa,

394
00:32:48,136 --> 00:32:52,245
- Kharkiv and Kiev in the fall.
- Congratulations.

395
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:57,432
And you Vassily?

396
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:01,102
Too busy killing rats
to come visit your mother?

397
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:06,889
I always wonder
if you'll get past it.

398
00:33:08,231 --> 00:33:11,774
Do Mr. and Mrs. Yodka still
think I work in city planning?

399
00:33:11,804 --> 00:33:14,092
I should advertise
what you do?

400
00:33:14,122 --> 00:33:16,851
Is there any gain for me
in telling people

401
00:33:16,853 --> 00:33:20,455
that you turned down
a graduate school scholarship

402
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:24,859
in architecture at Cornell
to become a rat catcher?

403
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:29,764
No. Not much.

404
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:34,602
But I didn't come here to fight.

405
00:33:34,604 --> 00:33:37,572
I came here to warn you.
You and ma.

406
00:33:38,144 --> 00:33:40,479
You need to get out
of this city.

407
00:33:40,711 --> 00:33:42,243
And why is that?

408
00:33:42,985 --> 00:33:45,880
Something evil has taken root.

409
00:33:45,882 --> 00:33:50,697
Some disease. Some horrible,
horrible strain.

410
00:33:50,727 --> 00:33:53,881
A pestilence that's
overrunning the city.

411
00:33:53,911 --> 00:33:56,457
It's turning people
into hungry vermin.

412
00:33:57,766 --> 00:34:01,692
Your job, Vassily,
it has warped your mind...

413
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:03,932
It's the truth.

414
00:34:05,224 --> 00:34:08,236
This is what I do.
This is what I know.

415
00:34:11,164 --> 00:34:14,075
You need to take that vacation
you always promised ma,

416
00:34:14,077 --> 00:34:17,955
but never given her.
You know, you need to go.

417
00:34:25,741 --> 00:34:27,288
I knew this would happen.

418
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:30,481
You appear after two years.

419
00:34:31,328 --> 00:34:34,496
And I'm supposed to flee
my home on what?

420
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:37,377
The word of a stranger.

421
00:34:43,752 --> 00:34:45,127
I tried.

422
00:34:47,305 --> 00:34:48,707
Goodbye, dad.

423
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:53,019
Stay. For your mother.

424
00:34:55,787 --> 00:34:56,980
Go.

425
00:34:58,439 --> 00:34:59,798
For me.

426
00:35:10,223 --> 00:35:14,831
Thanks. Make sure you put
these on before you look up.

427
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:24,416
- It's so cool.
- Yeah, I don't like it.

428
00:35:26,637 --> 00:35:28,543
It's a bad omen.

429
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:34,088
So what should we do, z?
Stay here or go?

430
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,101
Dad says go.

431
00:35:37,775 --> 00:35:40,929
I'm sorry you had
to see that this morning.

432
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:50,071
I'm sorry everything
is so chaotic right now.

433
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:55,677
Maybe what we both need
is a little normalcy, huh?

434
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,699
No place like home, right?
And you've got school.

435
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:09,929
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

436
00:37:08,889 --> 00:37:13,496
- C'mon.

437
00:37:13,526 --> 00:37:17,433
- Why'd we go this way?
- Because my phone told me to.

438
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:20,831
Jesus, look at that!

439
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:23,567
- Bennett?
- What?

440
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:26,280
That's the Manhattan medical examiner.

441
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,395
That's the guy right there who disappeared
along with the bodies of the passengers.

442
00:37:29,425 --> 00:37:32,693
- That's him, right there.
- He's just a crazy homeless guy.

443
00:37:33,613 --> 00:37:34,829
Ah! My God!

444
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:37,131
- Ah!
- Holy shit!

445
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,581
Leave it, it's not our problem.

446
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:41,702
- You kidding me?
- Leave it!

447
00:37:42,476 --> 00:37:44,779
- Ah! Ah!
- Hey!

448
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:46,785
- Damn New York City...
- No. No! No! No!

449
00:37:46,815 --> 00:37:50,778
Wait! Wait! Stop!
Federal agent! Stop!

450
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,847
- Ah! Ah!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

451
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:56,250
Stop! I said stop!

452
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:03,513
FBI. Freeze!

453
00:38:20,643 --> 00:38:23,492
Help... please...

454
00:38:24,815 --> 00:38:26,590
Give me your keys.

455
00:38:26,922 --> 00:38:28,185
- Give me your keys!
- Help me.

456
00:38:42,756 --> 00:38:47,082
I warned you I'm sorry.

457
00:38:53,409 --> 00:38:56,781
Yo Matty, you missing the big
show in the sky.

458
00:38:57,327 --> 00:38:59,042
- You OK, man?
- Yeah, yeah.

459
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,108
I... just got into a fight
with my girlfriend.

460
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:04,094
Just trying to find a way
to make it right.

461
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:06,079
Ah, don't text her man.
It's impermanent.

462
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:09,262
Look I know a guy who could sleeve
you up a real apology, though.

463
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:11,837
I was thinking more along the
lines of flowers, but thanks.

464
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:14,329
- Alright.
- Ah! Agh!

465
00:39:15,648 --> 00:39:17,110
Jeff, what happened?!

466
00:39:18,237 --> 00:39:21,477
Call security,
get a first aid kit. Go! Go!

467
00:39:21,507 --> 00:39:24,462
Hey! Hey! Hey! Everything...
Help is on the way, OK, buddy?

468
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:27,293
Who... who did this?
Who did this?

469
00:39:29,986 --> 00:39:33,673
<i>Many reports of
gruesome attacks occurring</i>

470
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:37,008
hey! Did you do this?!

471
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,546
- What was in the bag, homie?
- Shut up, bro. Let me think.

472
00:39:53,576 --> 00:39:57,160
We should've burned it, gusto.
Need a priest.

473
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,832
Coulda washed my hands
in holy water.

474
00:39:58,862 --> 00:40:01,963
How many times I gotta tell
you to let it go, Felix.

475
00:40:01,993 --> 00:40:03,839
That dude who picked us up...

476
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:07,373
He was scared...
And so were you.

477
00:40:07,403 --> 00:40:09,643
<i>And that German dude?
We met a diablo today, esse...</i>

478
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,452
Man, I told you. Shut up!

479
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:13,367
I wasn't scared,
you were scared.

480
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:21,296
- Hey yo, be easy man. Relax.

481
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:27,946
<i>Back up, man. Back up, puto.</i>

482
00:40:27,976 --> 00:40:30,997
Gusto! Help! Help!

483
00:40:37,313 --> 00:40:38,479

00:40:39,435 --> 00:40:42,072
What is it? Gusto, help!

485
00:40:43,117 --> 00:40:45,639

486
00:40:45,669 --> 00:40:47,729
What is that shit, bro?
Get it out!

487
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:49,019
Agh!

488
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:51,731
Hey! Police!

489
00:40:52,498 --> 00:40:54,495
Come here!

490
00:40:56,472 --> 00:41:00,902
- Here we go. Stop resisting!
- Ha! Ha! Ha! Now you show up.

491
00:41:34,456 --> 00:41:36,312
I'm ready to talk.

492
00:41:37,223 --> 00:41:38,573
Follow me.

493
00:42:18,885 --> 00:42:20,261
You're here.

494
00:42:26,842 --> 00:42:29,163
You're both ready. Good.

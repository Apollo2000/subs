1
00:00:02,337 --> 00:00:04,545
They want me back?

2
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:27,176
D'oh!

3
00:00:42,952 --> 00:00:45,087
No one's here today.

4
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:46,454
Even the choir's late.

5
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:01,228
Yeah.

6
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,637
Mom, with all the room,

7
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:04,922
do we have to sit
so close to the geezers?

8
00:01:04,923 --> 00:01:07,100
- It's too hot.
- It's too cold.

9
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,569
I'm not even alive.

10
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,888
What time
does Joan Rivers come on?

11
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:13,264
She doesn't.

12
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:15,742
This is a church,
and it's not your church.

13
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,101
<i>New</i> Testament?

14
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:19,604
Oy-yoi-yoi,
when did this happen?

15
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:23,274
Alexa,
play Tranquil Organ Radio.

16
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,496
Peace be with you.

17
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:30,239
And also with you.

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,259
Oh, you can do better than that.

19
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,669
We can, but we don't want to.

20
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,504
I can't hear you.

21
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:38,581
You clearly can.

22
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:40,416
Lord,
either make this interesting

23
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:42,936
or just rapture me now.

24
00:01:54,357 --> 00:01:56,099
Salt the ham water, boys.

25
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,976
Clancy Wiggum
is meeting his quota.

26
00:01:58,977 --> 00:02:00,695
Hey! That's illegal.

27
00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:02,313
Oh, sorry. You know what?

28
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:03,981
Here. Have a quarter, Chief.

29
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:06,793
You think you can bribe me
with a...? Oh, my God!

30
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,112
Those are the gentlest eyes
I've ever seen.

31
00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:11,539
Linen shirt. Natural highlights.

32
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,799
You want to hold my gun?

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,951
Y-You can.

34
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:16,878
Thanks. I was hoping
maybe you could point me

35
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,380
- to the church in town.
- Church?

36
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:20,715
Yeah, straight down this street.
First steeple you see.

37
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:23,626
That is not it. That's
the Eiffel Tower strip club.

38
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:25,645
They have
a French onion soup that is,

39
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,338
uh, well, it's just okay.

40
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:30,392
And I guess

41
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:31,893
that's about all.

42
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:39,326
You shall bore me no more!

43
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,552
You're going the wrong way!

44
00:02:40,553 --> 00:02:42,812
No, I-I want to go this way.
I love God.

45
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:45,499
If you love him so much,
why don't you marry him?

46
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,358
Penny. Button.

47
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:49,169
IOU for one penny.

48
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,695
Hi. Bode Wright.

49
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:52,672
Recovery meetings
are downstairs.

50
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,841
Booze to the right,
huffers to the left.

51
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,419
Sorry, I'm here about the ad.
On Christslist?

52
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,495
About you guys needing
a-a youth pastor?

53
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:01,014
I didn't place any ad.

54
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,182
I placed the ad.

55
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:06,761
- I'm Bode.
- Bode. Nice cross.

56
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:08,596
Tim's are chewed to nubs.

57
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:11,433
I-I chew my crosses.
Nervous habit.

58
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:15,195
Do you have
any experience, Bode?

59
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:16,530
I used to work in Michigan.

60
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:18,698
Had to use bottled holy water.

61
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,224
Uh-huh. Education?

62
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:22,185
I, uh, have a master's
in divinity

63
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:23,778
with a focus
on biblical languages.

64
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:25,730
- Greek, Hebrew...
- You're hired.

65
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:27,690
Up-bup-bup-bup-bup!
It doesn't work that fast.

66
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:31,194
We have I-9s and W-2s,
collar fittings.

67
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:33,863
And, besides,
<i>I'm</i> the one in charge.

68
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:36,532
In the end,
isn't God in charge here?

69
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,577
Do you see Jimmy Buffett
at every Jimmy Buffett caf×™?

70
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:41,329
I don't think so.

71
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,206
Hey, can I have this?
Marge could use it

72
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:45,082
to serve me snacks
while I'm on the toilet.

73
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,801
- Oh, just take it.
- So, Bode,

74
00:03:46,802 --> 00:03:49,137
- do you have anywhere to stay?
- Not yet.

75
00:03:49,138 --> 00:03:50,938
I saw a motel by the tire fire.

76
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:57,720
- He'll stay with us.
- No way.

77
00:03:57,721 --> 00:04:00,815
Uh, Reverend? The homeless
are here for their foot washing.

78
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:04,986
I'm looking for a mani-pedi
and an eyebrow wax.

79
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:07,489
I guess I could use
a little help around here.

80
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,249
Thank you. I won't let you down.

81
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,108
We don't hug here.

82
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:12,919
Mmm.

83
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,447
Uh, I'm here for the
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

84
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:19,784
It's usually me, Lenny, Carl,
Bumblebee Man, Kent Brockman.

85
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:21,336
But don't tell anyone.

86
00:04:21,337 --> 00:04:22,620
Downstairs to the right.

87
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:24,931
Also, Lunchlady Dora, King Toot,

88
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:28,602
and a man I'll identify
as Disco S.

89
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:31,937
Disco S is quite a mess.

90
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:37,593
Hmm.

91
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:39,922
Oh, Marge, this is embarrassing.

92
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:41,273
We don't need counseling.

93
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,441
We<i> do</i> need counseling.

94
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:45,127
I'm carrying a lot of anger.

95
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:47,203
Just do what I do. Come home

96
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,464
and have a hot dinner
waiting for you.

97
00:04:49,465 --> 00:04:51,466
Well, let me just say

98
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:53,826
that I go into this
with no preconceptions.

99
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,304
Now, tell me,
how is this Homer's fault?

100
00:04:56,305 --> 00:04:59,499
- He sold our home
without telling me.

101
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,958
Helen, is he playing

102
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,552
with my damn trains?

103
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,838
Excuse me. There's trouble
down at Lovejoy Junction.

104
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,423
So, we're good?

105
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:09,675
We're good
if we get our house back.

106
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,511
Did you say houseboat?

107
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:14,138
House<i> back.</i> House back!

108
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,231
Oh.

109
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,984
Sorry, Reverend.
I'm trying to get some rest?

110
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:28,820
The 12:10 to Trenton
doesn't stop

111
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:31,881
just because your fat head's
on the track.

112
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,754
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

113
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:39,181
- You gonna drop that?
- Not doing a thing.

114
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:41,091
As a gag, you're gonna drop
a tiny log on my face?

115
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,708
-Nothing.
-As I'm sleeping?
That's, that's-that's funny.

116
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,293
- Nothing. Nothing.
- Go ahead. Drop it.

117
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:45,745
- Drop a tiny log on me.
- Not doing a thing.

118
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:46,688
Is that... Is that your plan?
You're gonna drop that?

119
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:48,714
Look, we're both grown men here.

120
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,692
Now leave my choo choo alone.

121
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:51,942
Gladly.

122
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:53,862
Aah!

123
00:05:53,863 --> 00:05:56,556
Glad I finally got to use that.

124
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,200
Now, my sleepy, young friend,

125
00:05:58,201 --> 00:06:01,519
I don't know how you did things
back in "Michigan."

126
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,021
Air quotes are for when
something's not a real thing.

127
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:06,783
But in my parish,
we minister to our flock.

128
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,877
And I'm not afraid
to say the hard things

129
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:10,695
that need to be said.

130
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,715
- What?
- What did he say?

131
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:16,534
We can't hear you.

132
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:19,579
"B" thr-three.

133
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,464
You know, I'd be happy
to yell out numbers for you.

134
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,707
Help save your voice.

135
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,418
Bingo requires
a firm, experienced caller.

136
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,898
"N" for... "N" 43.

137
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,382
I got nothing.

138
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:34,927
I think I can handle it.

139
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,404
When I was in seminary school,

140
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:38,240
I was the shouty guy
on our rowing team.

141
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:40,742
We weren't allowed
to say "coxswain."

142
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:43,653
Bingo is not for newbies.

143
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,564
The letters sound very similar.

144
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,752
"B" as in Balthazar.

145
00:06:50,753 --> 00:06:52,420
Did he say Galthazar?

146
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:54,113
Gingo!

147
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,258
Gingo take you to bathroom.

148
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:58,451
I don't want to go.

149
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:02,121
Hey, this no picnic
for Gingo either.

150
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,748
Empty again.

151
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:06,083
And those two
just came here to make out.

152
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:13,608
If we do it in a church,
I, like, can't get pregnant.

153
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:18,021
Uh, good mor...

154
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,113
Excuse me.

155
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:28,147
Brothers and sisters,

156
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:32,460
Reverend Lovejoy is experiencing
some vocal difficulties.

157
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,298
Save your voice, Reverend.

158
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:38,842
Now, we could cancel church.

159
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:46,791
But God clearly foresaw this

160
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:48,718
and sent us a backup pastor

161
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,053
to finish the service.

162
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,965
<i>Church will not be canceled.</i>

163
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:58,636
Now please help me welcome

164
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:01,731
our new youth minister
Bode Wright.

165
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:06,018
Thanks. That's very meek.
Jesus would've loved it.

166
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,812
I was thinking, while
the reverend rests his voice,

167
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,831
maybe we could all sing a song.

168
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:11,752
Uh, Rev, if that's okay
with you, um, cough once.

169
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,744
We did not establish
what two coughs means,

170
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,654
so I'll take that
to mean two yeses.

171
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,657
Why don't we sing, I don't know,

172
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:21,158
"Amazing Grace"?
You all know that one.

173
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:22,844
Or if you don't,
it's in your hymnal under

174
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:25,871
"grace, comma, amazing."

175
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,892
This is the most exciting thing
that ever happened

176
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,894
in a white church!

177
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,855
All these years
of mediocre grace.

178
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:53,449
Finally, it's amazing.

179
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,543
This must've been
what it was like

180
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:57,620
at Jesus's concerts.

181
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,126
Thank you. Now we'd, uh,

182
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:04,994
we'd like to do
a couple of new psalms.

183
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:19,091
Something exciting's

184
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,718
happening at the church.

185
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:22,403
Let's check it out.

186
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:27,391
All right, I think we get it.
Grace, it's amazing.

187
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:29,727
I know most of you
usually save your "hallelujahs"

188
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:30,820
for when church is over.

189
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:33,773
I adore the informality.

190
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,750
But if it's okay, I thought
maybe I could just speak

191
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:36,942
to you guys
straight from my heart.

192
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,444
I don't have anything planned,

193
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:39,754
but I guess I should talk
about God, right?

194
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:41,089
Church. Pastor.

195
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,907
Makes sense
I should talk about God.

196
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:44,784
But the truth is,
I woke up this morning

197
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,619
and I wasn't really sure
if I believed in God.

198
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:48,930
No God?

199
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:50,265
Fingers in your ears, boys.

200
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:52,175
Till you can feel the brain.

201
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,459
It's okay. Everything's fine.

202
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,752
I-I just woke up
with some doubt.

203
00:09:54,753 --> 00:09:56,679
Like many of you did, too,
I'm sure.

204
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,464
There's so much pain
and suffering in the world,

205
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,442
I wasn't sure anyone
was really out there.

206
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:02,277
Watching us. On a cloud.

207
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:03,594
That's how we think of God,
right?

208
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:05,930
To many of us,
God is just an angry, old miser

209
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:07,531
with a killer
surveillance system.

210
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,768
Everyone picks on the miser.

211
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:11,861
Shave faster or no tip!

212
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:15,198
Oh, I shave-a faster, all right.

213
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,367
Hurry up.
I'm going to a funeral.

214
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:20,986
Oh, you're going to a funeral,
all right.

215
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,114
Oh, this is taking too long.

216
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:26,492
I got to stop procrastinating.

217
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,044
Then I got quiet
and thought about it.

218
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,454
It hit me that maybe God
isn't up there, you know.

219
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:31,547
"Somewhere else."

220
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,165
Maybe God's right here and now.

221
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,126
As close as the air
on your skin.

222
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:37,220
For the first time ever,
I don't feel alone.

223
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,813
Life is worth living.

224
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:40,982
Hey, forget that hit
I called on myself, huh?

225
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:42,967
Yeah, well, I said too late.

226
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:45,177
Can't you just charge me
a stalking fee?

227
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,729
Okay, 40%.

228
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,973
And you can only cancel
on the app.

229
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:50,850
All right, I-I'll just, uh...

230
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,284
My screen is frozen!

231
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,830
Maybe God is just
a word for a love

232
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:57,832
that we create
and remember together.

233
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,151
A love that isn't mad
at us for our doubt

234
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:02,837
or angry at us
because we're alcoholics.

235
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:08,826
Finally, recognized
for my accomplishments.

236
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:11,036
I think so many of us have
made a God that's like us,

237
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,371
instead of the other way around.

238
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,873
God loves diversity.

239
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,875
God didn't just make
one type of flower.

240
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,852
He made thousands
of different flowers...

241
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:19,503
Roses, lilies, orchids...

242
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:21,213
And He made the weeds, too.

243
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,857
But He loves all of them
indiscriminately.

244
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:24,508
Just like the bees.

245
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:28,345
You have made this bumblebee
a humble bee.

246
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:30,606
Jesus said, "Let the weeds
grow with the wheat."

247
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,200
That means it's all in the game.

248
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:33,443
Go easy on yourself.

249
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:35,227
You don't have
to earn God's love.

250
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,896
You<i> are</i> God's love.

251
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,522
All right, that's it.

252
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:39,949
I know it's early,
but it's a beautiful day.

253
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,209
Let's get out of here.

254
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,286
Sorry, concert's over, dude.

255
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:45,362
All that's left is the merch.

256
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:48,383
Bode! Bode! Bode!

257
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:51,744
Bode! Bode! Bode!

258
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,078
Three cheers
for Reverend Lovejoy.

259
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,630
Stupid Flanders.

260
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,749
Stupid Flanders!

261
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,259
Stupid Flanders!

262
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,228
I love church.

263
00:12:00,229 --> 00:12:01,603
I won't be single in Heaven.

264
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:07,402
This was the best church ever.

265
00:12:07,403 --> 00:12:09,812
It was like some kind
of religious experience.

266
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,722
Will you join us for pancakes?

267
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:12,982
Are those new vestments?

268
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,600
They really bring out the piety.

269
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,393
You don't have
to patronize me, Ned.

270
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:18,229
You're, y-you're right,
I'm sorry.

271
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,156
Y-You did not do well today.

272
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,824
Oh, go back to patronizing.

273
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,494
Maybe something about my shoes?

274
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:28,498
Oh, look at those shoes, tied
so tight with loops so even.

275
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:31,075
Someone knows
the bunny ear technique.

276
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:32,259
Helen tied them.

277
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,413
Uh, Pastor, would you
like to say grace?

278
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:37,790
Lord...

279
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,509
Oh, sorry, I should
have been more specific.

280
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,919
I meant the cool new pastor
everyone likes.

281
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,013
You can sit down.

282
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,348
You know, I think
the food is good

283
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:46,423
without me saying it's good.

284
00:12:46,424 --> 00:12:48,133
God made it good.

285
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,969
Don't get me wrong,
it's nice to be thankful, but

286
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,946
there's no need to make
everyone uncomfortable

287
00:12:51,947 --> 00:12:53,856
by praying in front of 'em,
am I right?

288
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,692
Nice speech, although
longer than grace.

289
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,936
Oh, no bacon for me.

290
00:12:58,937 --> 00:13:00,980
I'm a vegetarian.

291
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,124
And, actually, a Buddhist.

292
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,459
Great. I love Buddha.

293
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,609
That's where I got my name.

294
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,819
The Bodhi Tree.

295
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,870
And I don't eat meat either.

296
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,280
You're a vegetarian?

297
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:11,490
- What about evolution?
- Into it.

298
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,783
- Gay rights?
- Love is love.

299
00:13:12,784 --> 00:13:14,210
- Dizzy or Bird?
- John Coltrane

300
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,620
and Duke Ellington, 1962.

301
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,956
The only way
to describe how perfect

302
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:21,934
that jazz answer is,
is with jazz.

303
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,653
This brunch has turned into...

304
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:33,762
a jazz brunch!

305
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:35,514
I'm a believer.

306
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,850
That's great, Lisa,
but I actually don't think

307
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,810
faith comes down
to what we believe.

308
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:41,645
Well, you got to believe
in this baloney.

309
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:43,331
That's how you get into Heaven.

310
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:45,816
Where maybe,
just maybe, I could see

311
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:48,043
the mother
that abandoned me again.

312
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:51,697
Yeah, sure, but I think together

313
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,325
we can bring Heaven here
while we're still alive.

314
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:56,535
There's a Chinese proverb
about Heaven and Hell.

315
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,180
They say Hell is a long table
like this, full of food,

316
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:02,350
but everybody's starving because
they have these long chopsticks,

317
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:05,002
like pool cues, and they can't
bring the food to their mouths.

318
00:14:05,003 --> 00:14:07,546
This is the worst
Year of the Ox ever.

319
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,883
But in the proverb, Heaven is
the exact same table, same food,

320
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:13,695
same long chopsticks, but
everybody's happy and fat

321
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:15,346
because they're
feeding each other.

322
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:16,939
Aw!

323
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,942
Wait, wait! I can be cool,
too... with humor.

324
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,036
Did you hear the one about
the Greek-Jewish wedding?

325
00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:23,729
They didn't know whether
to break the plates

326
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,022
or the glasses!

327
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:29,210
Yes, why don't you take
your cultural insensitivity

328
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:32,071
back to the Spanish Inquisition
you came from?

329
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,364
I've lost them.

330
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:35,090
You never had us.

331
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:41,964
Timothy, the church council
wants to thank you

332
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,208
for your many years of...

333
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:45,393
Incompetence!

334
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:47,729
Knock his frock off.

335
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,897
We like the new guy
in his tight jeans.

336
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:52,400
Do not resuscitate your career.

337
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:54,385
What are you saying?
You're firing me?

338
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:57,054
- Gingo.
- Please surrender your cross.

339
00:14:57,055 --> 00:14:58,488
We don't want any trouble.

340
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:02,743
Timothy.

341
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:08,415
Now the collar.

342
00:15:10,586 --> 00:15:13,162
And any water
you turned into holy water

343
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,406
is once again regular water.

344
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:17,341
Nothing but tap.

345
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:28,252
Did you know Bode has
22,000 YouTube subscribers?

346
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:29,845
Our church could go viral.

347
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,273
Ugh. Close window.

348
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:34,591
- You just subscribed.
- What? No.

349
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:35,968
Now you gave him a thumbs-up.

350
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,278
Stop telling me what I just did.

351
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,522
You just gave him
an eggplant emoji.

352
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,598
Well, at least
that can't be misconstrued.

353
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:43,117
Wait a minute.

354
00:15:43,118 --> 00:15:45,477
The Internet can help me.
Help me find something on him.

355
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,104
He's clean on Google.

356
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:48,623
I'll have to try Bing.

357
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:51,316
<i>Sorry, I was asleep.</i>

358
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,610
<i>Do you really want to use us?</i>

359
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:55,129
Yes.

360
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,131
Hmm. Nothing.

361
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:58,708
But I'm not licked.

362
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,468
Pack your bags, Helen.

363
00:16:00,469 --> 00:16:02,511
We are going to Michigan.

364
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,333
Reverend? We're here
for a little counseling?

365
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,835
Well, I'd be happy to.

366
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,887
But you're already with
the best counselor there is.

367
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,431
- Your partner.
- Wait.

368
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:14,557
But Marge always told me

369
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,467
communication is bad
for a marriage.

370
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:18,152
I said it was good.

371
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:19,562
You said what was good?

372
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:20,846
You just have to know
what it's like

373
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,323
to be in each other's shoes.

374
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:24,141
Literally.
Put on each other's shoes.

375
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:25,142
Right now.

376
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,353
All right. They...

377
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:33,317
Your shoes are so tight.

378
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:34,818
And you do so much work.

379
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:36,245
You're an angel.

380
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,155
And your shoes are so heavy.

381
00:16:38,156 --> 00:16:40,842
I never realized
you carried around so much.

382
00:16:40,843 --> 00:16:44,161
I'm starting to see the man
I fell in love with again.

383
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:45,496
Where? Where? I'll kill him!

384
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:47,348
- You.
- Oh.

385
00:16:47,349 --> 00:16:49,833
I must admit, this is amazing.

386
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:52,353
But what about the fact
that he sold our house?

387
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:54,505
- Um, may I interject?
- Sure.

388
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:57,358
I've seen your house.
It'll never pass inspection.

389
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:59,360
- Are you sure?
- Piece of crap.

390
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:02,821
Thank you, Reverend. Mmm, mmm.

391
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:11,706
Lisa. What brings you here?

392
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:14,399
Well, I thought it might be fun
if we meditate together.

393
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,711
Sure. Make yourself at<i> om.</i>

394
00:17:16,712 --> 00:17:20,864
Wow! As meditation jokes go...

395
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:24,218
That's the only meditation joke
I've ever heard.

396
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:27,746
Alexa, play Meditation Jam.

397
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:33,752
You know,
science calls it consciousness,

398
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,380
the mystics call it a soul,
but both are just words,

399
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:38,232
just labels, for whatever it is

400
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,568
that's looking out your eyes
right now.

401
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:43,237
Breathe, Lisa.

402
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,766

403
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:31,993

405
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,699
we could go to Mackinac Island.

406

They have the longest
hotel porch in the world.

407
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:42,371
It's always the big verandas
with you, isn't it, Helen?

408
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:43,822
You've done something
to this town

409
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,374
I never thought could happen.

410
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,759
A full-blown religious revival.

411
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,306
Yeah, let these
warm your insides

412
00:18:52,307 --> 00:18:55,810
as the words of St. Paul
warm your soul, there.

413
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:57,812
Dear Ephesians...

414
00:18:57,813 --> 00:19:00,222
And I'm, of course,
paraphrasing here...

415
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,842
Believe in Christ or I'll hit
your head with a baseball bat.

416
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,060
I'll frickin' do it.

417
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,562
- Amen.
- Amen.

418
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,823
Hey, I'm-I'm not
trying to change any minds.

419
00:19:08,824 --> 00:19:10,900
I'm just trying
to start a conversation.

420
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:14,069
We need that.
This town's like a snow globe.

421
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,832
It doesn't look like much
till you shake it up a little.

422
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:21,577
I want redemption or else, dude.

423
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,004
Or else what?

424
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:24,988
Or Rabbi Mankiewicz will, dude.

425
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:27,491
And I have trouble
making that "cch" sound.

426
00:19:27,492 --> 00:19:30,044
It's either Chanukah
or Hanukkah.

427
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,662
Okay? Pick one of those.

428
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,263
Teach a man to microfiche,

429
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,099
and you'll feed him dirt
for a lifetime.

430
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,819
Vengeance is mine,
sayeth the me.

431
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,699
We really should've digitized
that stuff.

432
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,748
Oh, I hope part two
is about my rescue.

<i>Next week on

You, sir,
have challenged me on scripture.

438
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,976
Oh, well, if it's scripture
you want to talk,

439
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,811
then let us make a joyful noise

440
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:31,096
- unto the Lord.
- Good.

441

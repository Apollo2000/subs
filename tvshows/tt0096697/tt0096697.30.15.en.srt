is there anything better

7
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,963

misprints a coupon?

your mom is getting

You see that, kids?

It's the kind of car
they don't make anymore.

27
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,556
Windshield that breaks into
a thousand glass razor blades.

57
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,607
Seafoam. This is what
cars used to look like.

And what the sea
used to look like.

Whee!

Whoa!

there is a list.

Now, to teach you kids
a life lesson.

65
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,710
Moments of pure joy
always have consequences.

66
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,045
We already knew that.

67
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,963
Yeah. Why do you think we exist?

68
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,090
Quick!
Put on your innocent faces.

69
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,217
Innocenter... innocenter.

70
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:43,347
Uh, yeah, I'm, uh, I'm sorry,
you gave me the wrong car.

71
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:47,392
The moment I realized,
I brought it back immediately.

72
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,394
You stole my car.

73
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:53,690
My precious 1957 Cadillac
Eldorado Biarritz convertible

74
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:57,110
in the original seafoam,
with the illegal brodie knob.

75
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,572
Oh, God. Tell me right now you
did not touch my brodie knob.

76
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,574
Absolutely not.

77
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,618
This is the brodie knob.

78
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,662
Oh. I was all over that thing.

79
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,163
You're in big trouble.

80
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,457
They're gonna charge you
with grand theft auto.

81
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,293
A lousy game
but a magnificent law.

82
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,629
Listen, I'm sorry.
Really sorry.

83
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,090
I just wanted to give
my kids a ride,

84
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,800
show them the house
I was born in,

85
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,593
show them the house
I'm gonna die in,

86
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,761
then drive through
a cornfield for kicks.

87
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,763
Whoo-hoo!

88
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,724
I gave you
the USS Enterprise,

89
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:31,228
and you returned
with the Orville!

90
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,814
I am so sorry.
You're absolutely right.

91
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,482
I'll get it fixed by a pro.

92
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,567
I'll get you a license plate
frame saying

93
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,612
"My other car is a..."
insert dumb movie reference.

94
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,240
Tron Legacy Light-Cycle.
Well, okay.

95
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,743
I suppose I could allow you to--
oh, God!

96
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,286
No!

97
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:52,624
My mint condition copy
of Radioactive Man number one!

98
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,961
This was the comic
I always wanted most

99
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,463
since I was an athletic,
popular child.

100
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,048
Look, you're a nice guy.

101
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,510
When have you ever seen me
be a nice guy?!

102
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,514
I am pressing charges!

103
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,726
Is this yours?

104
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,854
Yes.

105
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,522
Simpson, get on the bike.

106
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,315
Put your arms around me.

107
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:20,652
Now, head on my shoulder.
Yeah... aw, that's nice.

108
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,529
And don't lean the same way I do

109
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,697
or we're both dead.

110
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,657
Uh, by the way,
you're under arrest.

111
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,243
Uh, doesn't the law say
I need a helmet, too?

112
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,996
Another law you're breaking.

113
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:35,292
Why are you riding a motorcycle?

114
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,127
It's not for fun!
I got arrested!

115
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,047
That's worse!

116
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,841
Your Honor, I'm scared.
Okay, I screwed up.

117
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,303
If you'll permit, may I read
a speech in my defense?

118
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,554
Did your daughter write it?

119
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,181
Absolutely not.

120
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,641
Sir, if an opportunity
came along

121
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,019
to give your kids
a memory they'll never forget,

122
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,229
- wouldn't you hop
in the driver's seat?

123
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,815
A golden day with their dad.

124
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,443
What could be more innocent?

125
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,279
All I know is that
as that gas gauge read empty,

126
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,407
our hearts were full.
Full of love.

127
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:12,913
Love of what our country does
best: build cars 60 years ago!

128
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,626
I'm a judge.
But I'm also a father.

129
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,461
A father whose ex-wife
only lets him see the kids

130
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,297
on summers and Christmas.
I don't need you to rub it in.

131
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,757
I find the defendant guilty.

132
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,384
Your Honor, I'm not the one
on trial here.

133
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,969
Yes, you are.

134
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,058
"Hire a lawyer," I said.
"Waste of money," he said.

135
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,895
This is what I spend my time
in courtroom audiences for.

136
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,481
This is my Starbucks.

137
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,319
Two weeks.
Two weeks to turn this around.

138
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,946
Lisa, can we get the state

139
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,864
to change its sentencing
guidelines

140
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,199
in the next two weeks?

141
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,202
Ah, the legislative calendar
is pretty full.

142
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,621
And they take off
the second week for Easter.

143
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,916
Roman Easter! To the Byzantine
world, it's nothing!

144
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,336
I'm afraid we have to prepare
for the possibility

145
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,672
that you might go to prison.

146
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,385
The Arts and Incarceration
Channel presents...

147
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,682
What advice would you give
to a new inmate?

148
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,517
Everything can be a weapon.

149
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,520
I saw a guy get his eye gouged
with uncooked spaghetti.

150
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,856
You sound
like you've seen a lot.

151
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,317
I've seen things and done things
I ain't proud of.

152
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,527
And I'm the chaplain.

153
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,779
I can't take this, Marge.

154
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,991
Maybe I can make peace
with Comic Book Guy.

155
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,993
Do you think so?
He's an angry man.

156
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,663
His favorite thing is Star Wars,
and he hates Star Wars.

157
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,456
I'll talk to him.

158
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:41,668
Careful, Marge.
He's a lazy, overweight slob.

159
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,462
Don't fall in love with him.

160
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:51,511
Comic Book Guy,
my husband is really sorry.

161
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:55,140
Okay, he screwed up.
But he doesn't belong in prison.

162
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,934
I beg to differ.
That car is very special to me.

163
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,811
When I was young,
my father took me in it to...

164
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,898
- Buy comic books?
- No, not comic books.

165
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,066
Everything in my life
is not comic books, okay?

166
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,860
We bought baseball cards.

167
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,863
Look, we'll detail your car
and fix your comic book.

168
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,491
This is not about my car.
It is about me getting respect.

169
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:16,328
I want all the Little Lulus
five dollars can buy.

170
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,663
And make it snappy,
Blobba the Hutt.

171
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:22,167
Jabba is actually quite slim!
For a Hutt.

172
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,710
Just get the Lulus.

173
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,088
Or I'll take my business
to Build-A-Bear.

174
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,926
Here you go. Five dollars'
worth of Little Lulus.

175
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,554
As for you, I am not budging.

176
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,849
Like the door of Superman's
Fortress of Solitude

177
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,685
when the Beatles tried to visit.
Pure folly.

178
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,896
That comic is noncanonical.

179
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,274
The only thing noncanonical
in my store is Snoopy

180
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:50,612
dressed as Sgt. Rock
for an ill-timed Vietnam war ad.

181
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,199
I see. Well, I'm sorry
to have bothered you.

182
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,326
Yes, don't let the door hit you
on the way out.

183
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,328
No, seriously.
It's just been painted.

184
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,415
Oh. That's what
being nice gets you.

185
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,836
Mom, Dad, I think I found
the answer on the Internet!

186
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,297
Lisa, nothing good
ever comes from YouTube.

187
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,093
Except ducks eating watermelon.

188
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,392
No, no.
Sentencing mitigation videos.

189
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,352
People have had
their jail terms reduced,

190
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,688
or even gotten off death row

191
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,691
by producing slick
video appeals to the judge.

192
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,820
Finally, a way for rich people
to bend the system their way.

193
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,822
Mr. Burns got off the hook once

194
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,492
by using a video directed
by Guillermo del Toro.

195
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:41,079
Hello, I am, uh, film director
Guillermo del Toro.

196
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,250
Uh, when I was a young boy,
I fell in love with monsters.

197
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,461
Frankenstein's monster,
King Kong, Son of Kong,

198
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,964
Nosferatu, Godzilla,
Mechagodzilla,

199
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,632
Godzilla's nephew Godzooky,

200
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,301
Mothra the caterpillar,
Mothra the moth,

201
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,136
the Blob from The Blob...

202
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,805
and Godzilla's cousin,
Sheldon Godzilla.

203
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,474
Lesser known
but equally horrifying.

204
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,811
Monsters, yes.
But they are capable of love.

205
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,564
Which brings us
to Montgomery Burns.

206
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,149
Oh, hello.

207
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,734
Did someone mention me?

208
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,112
From birth, he was not wanted.

209
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,449
Then came the real monsters:

210
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,493
the bullies that hated him
just because he was wealthy.

211
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,496
And maybe he rubbed it in
a little.

212
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,629
But no one knows
the real Mr. Burns.

213
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,851
I love Señor Burns.

214
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,311
Who are you?

215
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,563
He combines the ancient evil
of Cthulhu

216
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,149
with the trim physique
of Slender Man.

217
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,860
Señor Burns demonstrates
that in all so-called monsters

218
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,071
beats a heart.
Thank you for listening.

219
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,405
And thank you,
Georgia Film Commission,

220
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,115
for the 22% discount.

221
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,493
I'll see you wherever
free people congregate.

222
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,328
Like the Yale Club.

223
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,295
Wow. Maybe I've been
all wrong about evil.

224
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,465
Once again, Mr. del Toro
stripped away the darkness

225
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,467
and found beauty at its core.

226
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,637
Like that fish-snuggling movie.

227
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,389
Excuse me.

228
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,976
Ah... you told me you've
never been to Missouri.

229
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,479
You're right, honey.
Hollywood can solve anything.

230
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,023
Except its own lack
of creativity and diversity.

231
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,691
Now, how do we make this thing?

232
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,069
I think we should use
a videographer.

233
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,738
There's one left in town.

234
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,158
I will do anything
for your wedding video.

235
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,246
Color, black and white, or
Polaroid Swinger, cha cha cha.

236
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,748
I gotta warn you,
my camera hand is shaky

237
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,960
because I have
a major vitamin E deficiency.

238
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,921
No problemo.
It works fine if you just

239
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,256
nod your head like this...

240
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,763
You know, we could
just do it ourselves.

241
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,643
Yeah. Those are the words
that are killing my profession.

242
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,395
Now you say nice things
about me.

243
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,729
So what is it
you're looking for?

244
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,232
Words or something?
Uh, human words?

245
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,902
Okay, uh, Homer Simpson,
uh, well, real family man.

246
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,155
Yeah. Always brings his kids
into the bar.

247
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,991
Not one of them aristocrats
who gets all bent out of shape

248
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,659
when there's a mouse
in his beer.

249
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,412
Hey, Moe. I need you to file a
serial number off a wheelchair.

250
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,580
Cut!

251
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,124
Hmm... Homer Simpson?
How can I put this?

252
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:35,044
Ah, we've never had an employee
get rehired so many times.

253
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,214
Homer Simpson has two children
enrolled in our school.

254
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,259
That's all I'm
comfortable saying.

255
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,761
All right, let's see
what you got.

256
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,931
I had to edit a little.

257
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,975
Homer Simpson. Family man.

258
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,643
Happy. Aristocrat.

259
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,228
Too. Cool. Comfortable.

260
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,606
Homer is a...
grace to the family.

261
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,649
He is an ape... le father.

262
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,194
I warned Marge... marry him.

263
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,655
That's the best you can do?
I'm screwed!

264
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,492
Not while I can use
Final Cut Pro.

265
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,993
We'll start from scratch.

266
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,996
Using the only two things
people still believe in:

267
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,664
babies and dogs.

268
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,460
Sorry, Snowball,
cats are polarizing.

269
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,006
Please...

270
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,469
just give us something
we can use.

271
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,765
We're ready.

272
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,142
Oh, now the dog
won't cooperate.

273
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,979
There's a trick that always
works with Kevin James.

274
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,530
♪ I think I'll color
this man father... ♪

275
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,657
He's a guy who gets off at 5:00

276
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,785
and comes directly home
to be with his kids.

277
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,454
♪ Said I'm gonna
color him father ♪

278
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,164
♪ Color him father... ♪

279
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,126
He's incredibly generous
to his friends and neighbors.

280
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:02,298
In his spare time,
he loves PTA meetings.

281
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,592
Helping with the Cub Scouts.

282
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,178
Or just going to the movies.

283
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,180
This is Maggie, our baby.

284
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,849
And she understands
what's going on.

285
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,311
She's never said a word,
but I get the feeling

286
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,231
she wants to say something now.

287
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,067
Nee... Da... dy.

288
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,571
What a man.

289
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,781
And now we pray.

290
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,533
Bless us, O Lord,
for this bountiful feast...

291
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,076
Not that prayer.

292
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,245
I must say, I am impressed.

293
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,039
So, unless the prosecution has
a rebuttal, I'm inclined to...

294
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,333
Not... so... fast.

295
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,960
Do you have a video, too?

296
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,962
No, that would be pretentious.

297
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:45,008
- Very well, then.
- I have a speech.

298
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,927
- Comic book sales is
a very fragile field.

299
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,763
Kids hate to read,
the stores smell like farts

300
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:54,225
and bubble gum...

301
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,937
Then the things I cherish most--
my father's car,

302
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,107
my precious, precious comic,
and most important,

303
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,611
my dignity-- were taken from me.

304
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,238
I'm just your ordinary
small businessman.

305
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,824
Never took anything from anyone.

306
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:14,412
But I did dare to think
I would be treated with respect.

307
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,790
I have so many fictional heroes,
Your Honor.

308
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,295
For once, please
give me a real one.

309
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,966
Best. Courtroom speech. Ever.

310
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,092
Yes!

311
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,136
I will render
my sentence tomorrow.

312
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,846
I thank you.
Good night.

313
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,222
Boom.

314
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,974
Wait, wait, wait.
Do you want to go to a movie?

315
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,726
I'll go to a movie
with you, Judge.

316
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,562
- You won't be available.
- Oh.

317
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,485
Dad, the computer says...

318
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,987
That computer has brought me
nothing but trouble

319
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,448
and sports scores
while I'm at church!

320
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,325
A store in Ogdenville
just put up

321
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,827
the same Radioactive Man comic
that we destroyed

322
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,788
in perfect condition.

323
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,748
It's my last hope at freedom.

324
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,751
I mean, how much could
an old comic cost?

325
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,565
- Are you done?
- No.

326
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:41,290
You can't be closed.
It's Tuesday at 4:30!

327
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:46,170
Do you not see the "closed" sign
written in Wakandan?

328
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,132
And I wasted high school
learning German.

329
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,300
Was fur eine Schande!

330
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:55,388
Well, German is Earth's closest
language to Klingon.

331
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,640
Come on in.

332
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,076
What do you want?

333
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,746
I'm extremely busy.

334
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,126
Mm-hmm.

335
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,544
I want to talk to you.

336
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,797
I see we have reached the
epilogue of our little drama.

337
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,885
No, not the epilogue.
Still plot. Still plot!

338
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,636
Look, I know we've had
our differences,

339
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,263
but we can still be friends.

340
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,099
Like when Superman teamed up
with Lex Luthor.

341
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,436
That was an imaginary story
written by Harlan Ellison

342
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,979
because he wanted to get fired.

343
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,733
Well, maybe this will
tickle your ponytail.

344
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,863
The Ogdenville copy!
It lives!

345
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,823
Am I forgiven?

346
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,365
I'm afraid not. No.

347
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,202
I don't have a choice.
The grudge is still inside me.

348
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,997
Which is also the name of
a low-budget Roger Corman movie.

349
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,791
Oh! What does it take?

350
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,834
How to explain
what I am feeling.

351
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,629
Uh... look around.
What do you see?

352
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,256
Uh... a bunch of stuff
that other people threw out?

353
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,175
Like a mirror,
you see everything

354
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,636
but understand nothing.
Get out.

355
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,138
Let's go.

356
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,556
Oh, my God! Oh!

357
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,852
Is that a season one
Welcome Back, Kotter key chain?

358
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,896
It is! The proof...

359
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,565
a John Travolta
who is happy to be there!

360
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,193
How did you get this?

361
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,073
Did I ever tell you
about my Uncle Max?

362
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,491
He was the halfback
in the family.

363
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,618
If you gave him a sandwich,
you got half back.

364
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,498
This is for you, son.

365
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,124
Don't say I never
gave you nothing.

366
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,126
Are you gonna give me
anything else?

367
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,212
Nope. One thing.

368
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,799
Homer, when you look
at your precious totem there,

369
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,425
how does it make you feel?

370
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,135
I never thought of it before.

371
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,345
I touch it all the time.

372
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,597
I feel unhappy
if I don't have it.

373
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,391
Sometimes I dream about it.

374
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,726
I think I love it!

375
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,855
Well put. Now understand this.

376
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,231
Dah!

377
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,109
That is how you made me feel!

378
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,362
Now you see.

379
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,406
And you may consider
the charges dropped.

380
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,867
Let us shake hands,
drink rice wine,

381
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,326
and enjoy Swedish Fish candy.

382
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,579
Are you saying I'm off the hook?

383
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,539
Yes.
In fact, you may be surprised,

384
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,541
but you are now my best friend.

385
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,418
So I'm not going to prison?

386
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,670
No, you are going
to Comic-Con with me.

387
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,213
Oh. Hmm.

388
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,007
Let me see, let me see.

389
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,718
Dad, just say yes.

390
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,262
Is prison still an option?

391
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,931
No. Not until you hold down
Harrison Ford

392
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,017
while I clip off
his fingernails.

393
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,019
Let's get to it.

394
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,613
- What's this?
- Mitigation video.

395
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,742
When I first met Bart, I was
just a nerdy kid with glasses.

396
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,994
But now this
blue-haired butterfly's

397
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,747
ready to emerge from his pupa!

398
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,207
Simpson, you think
this is helping you?

399
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,629
Skinner's a jerk.
Skinner's a jerk.

400
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,173
Skinner's
a jerk. Skinner's a jerk.

401
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,591
Skinner's a jerk.

402
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,926
Skinner's
a jerk.

403
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,261
Skinner's a jerk.

404
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,973
Shh!

00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:48,111
D'oh!

6
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:57,654
Well, this is
a no-brainer.

7
00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:03,961
D'oh!

8
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,030
D'oh!

9
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:09,666
D'oh!

10
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:12,436
D'oh!

11
00:01:14,472 --> 00:01:15,839
D'oh!

12
00:01:15,874 --> 00:01:17,274
D'oh!

13
00:01:17,308 --> 00:01:18,742
D'oh!

14
00:01:18,776 --> 00:01:20,844
D'oh!

15
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:21,879
D'oh!

16
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,313
D'oh!

17
00:01:28,553 --> 00:01:29,620
Now what?

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,834
Well, I better get going.

19
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:45,636
Should I just put that
on your tab?

20
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,204
No, I'll pay off my bill.

21
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:48,639
Hmm?

22
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:49,940
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

23
00:01:49,974 --> 00:01:51,341
Someone's actually paying?

24
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:54,811
Now let me see if I remember
how to open this thing.

25
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:56,446
Some kind of button or knob.

26
00:01:57,582 --> 00:01:59,883
So that's what that noise means.

27
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:01,051
Just take your stupid money.

28
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:02,519
Huh?

29
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:05,822
Hey, this jacket's
full of old stuff.

30
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:07,925
I knew I wasn't getting
my money.

31
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:10,494
Hey.

32
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:13,096
D'oh!

33
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:15,465
Losers.

34
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,200
What the...?

35
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:19,603
Oh.

36
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,506
Ooh!

37
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,508
Here's a roll of film
I never developed.

38
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:25,709
Well, too late for that.

39
00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:27,477
All those
photo developing joints

40
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:30,547
are either knocked down or have
been turned into deer blinds.

41
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,493
Eh, listen, Homer.

42
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:45,162
Uh, I can develop this for you.

43
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:47,197
Yeah, this bar is so poorly lit,

44
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:49,333
it's legally a darkroom.

45
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:51,802
Mmm... mmm.

46
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:53,003
And the best part is,

47
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:55,038
Duff is
chemically indistinguishable

48
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:56,673
from developing fluid.

49
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,442
Way to go, Duff!

50
00:02:58,476 --> 00:03:00,377
I'm developing quite a thirst.

51
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:02,746
Now, there's an
eight-by-ten I can enjoy.

52
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:14,958
Here you go, Midge.

53
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:17,194
I played with the colors
and changed the lighting,

54
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:19,796
but I could only make your kids
so cute and no cuter.

55
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:21,098
This is so exciting.

56
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:22,699
It's like a sneak peek

57
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:25,802
into the long-forgotten
world of six years ago.

58
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:27,437
Yeah, well, beware.

59
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:29,473
These pictures show
that six years ago,

60
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:30,774
Bart and Lisa were fighting

61
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:32,809
like creationists
and common sense.

62
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:35,779
Hey, photos don't lie,
my friend.

63
00:03:37,515 --> 00:03:38,915
Would you like
a matte finish?

64
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,183
Sure.

65
00:03:42,653 --> 00:03:44,654
There you go.

66
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,426
♪ And I know if I don't ♪

67
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,397
♪ I'll go out of my mind ♪

68

71
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:06,176
♪ The kids
are all right. ♪

72
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,178
Homer, you shot
all these pictures.

73
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:09,980
Why didn't you step in?

74
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:11,815
The light was
so good, Marge.

75
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:13,450
It was like Florence in May.

76
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:15,118
I don't get it.

77
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:18,055
How come I was always fighting
with Señorita Stupid?

78
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:20,490
Don't waste beer.

79
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:21,825
And how did we reach

80
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:23,994
the uneasy alliance
we enjoy today?

81
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:25,762
Well, it's quite a story.

82
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:29,699
A story of a special bond
between a brother and a sister.

83
00:04:29,734 --> 00:04:31,835
I'd say our story
is a tragedy.

84
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:33,370
Like the <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

85
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:35,806
The tragedy being they can never
stop making them.

86
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,441
Hey, come on.

87
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:39,609
The first and eighth movies
were pretty darn good.

88
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:42,012
Now, as for you kids,

89
00:04:42,046 --> 00:04:44,214
<i>it all began six years ago.</i>

90
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:47,150
<i>The president of back then</i>
<i>was the president.</i>

91
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:49,119
<i>The popular music</i>
<i>of those times</i>

92
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:50,787
<i>was all the rage.</i>

93
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:53,623
<i>Wherever we went,</i>
<i>you kids fought.</i>

94
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:56,660
"Penny the Penguin wanted
to go to the North Pole.

95
00:04:56,694 --> 00:04:59,863
Wally the Walrus wanted
to go to the South Pole."

96
00:04:59,897 --> 00:05:03,400
I guess you could say
they were "polar opposites."

97
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:07,337
You see, they're polar opp...
I get it.

98
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:09,573
It's just not funny.
You know what's funny?

99
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:10,907
This.

100
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:12,142
<i>Goodnight Moon?</i>

101
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:13,477
Good night, Bart!

102
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:19,683
Did I hear someone
whispering hush?

103
00:05:21,352 --> 00:05:24,354
I want you to get out.

104
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:27,724
And stay out!

105
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:29,259
Thank you.

106
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:31,361
So that's why
we started going

107
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:33,096
to story time at
the Kwik-E-Mart.

108
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:37,067
Remember when Apu let Dad
have the expired hot dogs?

109
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:41,338
Just once, and I'm
still taking medication for it.

110
00:05:41,372 --> 00:05:44,908
So many photos
of you kids fighting.

111
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:47,244
That's why we
never developed that roll.

112
00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:49,279
What? Back to that story?

113
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:54,017
Why can't you just relax
and be nice to your sister?

114
00:05:54,051 --> 00:05:55,852
My bed scares me.

115
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:57,187
That's ridiculous.

116
00:05:57,221 --> 00:05:59,122
Now, just close your eyes

117
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:00,557
and nuzzle in

118
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:03,226
under the big clown fangs.

119
00:06:04,462 --> 00:06:07,164
Attaboy.
Sweet dreams.

120
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:13,036
She took my pencil.

121
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,905
Lisa, there are plenty
of mini golf pencils

122
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:16,439
in the kitchen drawer.

123
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:20,443
Tell Bart, because it's
my pencil and he stole it!

124
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:22,746
Starfish head!

125
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,715
I can write your name
better than you.

126
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:31,988
A.
Ow!

127
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:32,923
E.
Ow!

128
00:06:32,957 --> 00:06:34,057
I.
Ow!

129
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:35,926
O.
You jerk!

130
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,127
Ow!

131
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:38,762
Why, you little...

132
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,725
Where is he learning
this violence?

133
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:22,451
Things got so bad between Bart
and Lisa, I was losing sleep.

134
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:27,289
Homer.

135
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,124
Homer, I just had
the worst dream.

136
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:31,927
I lost one of the kids
at the World's Fair.

137
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:33,895
It's okay. Which one?

138
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,297
Brisbane '88.

139
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:37,899
That's so horrible, baby.

140
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:39,568
I know, I know.

141
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:40,802
Now, don't worry.

142
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:42,604
They're right here
in the bed.

143
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:48,076
We have to find some answers.

144
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:49,478
Answers.

145
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:51,680
That's your answer
for everything.

146
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:57,719
My findings are that one of
your children is smart and good,

147
00:07:57,754 --> 00:08:00,589
and the other
is dim and evil.

148
00:08:00,623 --> 00:08:02,724
Professionally,
I'm not permitted

149
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,493
to say which is which.

150
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:05,727
Is it the boy?

151
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:08,263
I told you, I can't say.

152
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:10,098
What did that say?

153
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,801
We're done here.
Not so fast.

154
00:08:12,835 --> 00:08:14,936
We have 40 minutes left.

155
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:18,740
All right,
we'll do a trust exercise.

156
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:20,609
Shut your eyes.

157
00:08:24,814 --> 00:08:26,448
What are we going to do?

158
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:28,617
It's not so bad, sweetie.

159
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:31,253
I took a box of Altoids
from her waiting room.

160
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:34,122
The most anyone has ever
gotten out of therapy.

161
00:08:38,194 --> 00:08:39,428
Watch it!

162
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:40,762
Trying to mow.

163
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:42,364
The city's making
me do this.

164
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:43,965
Hey, neighboreeno.

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,667
Maude and I know
how hard it is

166
00:08:45,702 --> 00:08:48,003
to be dealt
a pair of little jokers.

167
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:51,540
Daddy, may we please go tuck
ourselves in for naps now?

168
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:54,142
Now, you know you can't tuck
yourselves in till you're 18.

169
00:08:54,177 --> 00:08:55,677
Go get Mommy.

170
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:59,014
I'm sorry you had
to witness that.

171
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:00,282
Me, too.

172
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:01,683
Anyway, Maude
and I thought

173
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:03,118
you'd like to hang
out with adults

174
00:09:03,152 --> 00:09:04,619
and have some mature
conversatiaroonies,

175
00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:06,288
so we'd like to
take you to brunch.

176
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:07,989
Brunch? I wish.

177
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:10,292
Can't get a sitter
'cause our kids are nuts,

178
00:09:10,326 --> 00:09:12,427
and no kennel will take them.

179
00:09:14,831 --> 00:09:17,032
Now, sir,
don't you waffle on that brunch.

180
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:18,533
Grandma Flanders can
watch the kids.

181
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:19,901
Hello, Joe.

182
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:21,203
Doesn't know who I am...

183
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:22,671
has trouble moving...

184
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:24,806
I'd say we have
ourselves babysitter.

185
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:26,475
I just turned a hundred.

186
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:27,843
Eight bucks an hour.

187
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:29,745
I can't hear you.

188
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,380
I said seven bucks!

189
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:38,520
"Woe to you,
scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites.

190
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:41,056
For you tithe mint
and dill and cumin."

191
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,792
Todd, I like how gentle
you are with that toy.

192
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:45,460
Enough nonsense.

193
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:47,362
It's time for prayers.

194
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:49,197
I don't know any prayers.

195
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:51,166
Is "hell's bells" a prayer?

196
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,968
'Cause Daddy says it
all the time.

197
00:09:57,507 --> 00:09:59,074
Woop...

198
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:02,644
and woop... and...

199
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:04,813
ziperoo.

200
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:08,383
I never said this before,
but the food can wait.

201
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,051
What do you mean?

202
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:12,053
Let's role- play.

203
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:13,488
Okay, but fast.

204
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:14,990
Um, um, got it.

205
00:10:15,024 --> 00:10:16,725
Uh, me: seagull.

206
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:19,027
You: boardwalk trash can.

207
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:20,162
Ooh!

208
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:29,838
Well, isn't this a great
chance to drink more water?

209
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:31,640
My bladder's
going to burst.

210
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,708
I know you've haa
few too many waters,

211
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:36,211
but that is no reason
for the sailor talk.

212
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,548
She's awfully quiet.

213
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:41,983
Her body usually
whistles.

214
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:44,419
Well, this always
wakes my grandpa up.

Ice cream truck!

223
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:19,187
Mmm, that was
wonderful.

224
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:21,756
My favorite kind
of weekend morning.

225
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:25,727
A sexy snuggle while our rotten
kids are someone else's problem.

226
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:42,110
Bart, those are
strangers.

227
00:11:42,144 --> 00:11:44,613
You're right, let's
go where it's safe.

228
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:46,047
Watch it!

229
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,625
Faster, faster.

230
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:58,627
Your brother
is stupid.

231
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:00,629
Bye-bye.

Thank you for a
wonderful brunch.

237
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,308
I don't know
what I liked more--

238
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,311
the personalized omelets
or the light jazz combo.

239
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:31,149
I liked when the trumpet
player's cheeks got really big.

240
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,583
That's good music.

241
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,088
Grandma Flanders
has passed.

242
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:39,924
Where are <i>our</i> kids?
Gone.

243
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,760
Looks like once Grandma turned
to dust, they took a powder.

244
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,362
Sorry if that seems
a little flip.

245
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,797
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

246
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,432
Don't worry, sweetie.

247
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,834
We'll call the local police,
and they'll find our kids.

248
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:51,335
We never used
them till now,

249
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,337
but I'm sure they're
highly competent.

250
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:57,175
Gunderson, before we hire
you, one final test.

251
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,177
Can you get these
handcuffs off of me?

252
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,613
Uh, might seem like a one-time
situation, but it's not.

253
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,020
Hey, you know,
I used to represent

254
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,022
Silver Star
Police Supplies.

255
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,858
Then they gave my territory
to the owner's nephew.

256
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:16,294
And they wonder why
they lost Jackson City.

257
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,296
I was Jackson City!

258
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,997
Yeah, focus on
the cuffs, please.

259
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,669
Well, well.

260
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,738
Look who's burning plastic.

261
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:30,274
It's mine. Give it back.

262
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,310
Looks like someone
hasn't learned--

263
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,312
you don't argue
with bullies.

264
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,715
Thank goodness I have
a teaching fist.

265
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,125
What's her problem?

266
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:52,263
Please, don't hurt my brother.

267
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:54,432
Aw, come on.
Don't cry.

268
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,769
This is why I'm so nervous
about becoming a dad.

269
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,606
I'm crying
out my nose.

270
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:07,545
Fine, you babies
can go.

271
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,547
Let's go over
to Mommy & Me

272
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:13,151
and cut holes in the parachute
so it doesn't billow properly.

273
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:15,453
Baby!

274
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,888
All right, let's move.

275
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,289
Why aren't you crying?

276
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:20,391
I was pretending,
and it worked.

277
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:22,026
Hmm.

278
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,428
You know, kid,
with your smarts and my Barts,

279
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,063
we make a good team.

280
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,465
What are "Barts"?

281
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,966
You're the smart one,
you figure it out.

282
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,237
I sure hope this book is right.

283
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,275
Marge, I'm back.

284
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,110
Sorry, nothing.

285
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,813
But if we have a third kid,
we should call her Maggie.

286
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,214
Why Maggie?

287
00:14:43,248 --> 00:14:45,049
It's a good name
if we lose her.

288
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,051
Maggie? Maggie?

289
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,653
Going back out.

290
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:51,489
Maggie?

291
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:56,994
All right, I'm turning to a
desperate mother's last resort.

292
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:02,900
I hope it works.

293
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,502
Psychic hotline.

294
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,504
Selma? You're
a psychic now?

295
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,339
I'm filling in
for a friend.

296
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:09,774
She got hit by a car.

297
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,409
Never saw it coming.

298
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:14,612
I'll never see
my kids again.

299
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:16,447
I'm sensing...

300
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:17,849
it's all your
husband's fault.

301
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,650
That'll be $20.

302
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,856
I know this place.

303
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,930
It's where Grampa and his
friends the monsters live.

304
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,963
I want to pinch 'em.

305
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:35,366
Teach me how
to use my phone.

306
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,803
Stay away from my grandchildren,
you love-sucking ghouls.

307
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:44,609
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

308
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,011
I made it out of clay.

309
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,348
Where did you go?

310
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,984
Now, you have
some candy,

311
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,420
while I tell the nurses
station to go get your folks.

312
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,462
I guess you should
be in charge, Lisa.

313
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,863
You'll always
be half my age,

314
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,698
but you'll always
be smarter than me.

315
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,534
Don't worry, Bart, you'll
always think you're in charge,

316
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,370
even though I
secretly will be.

317
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,604
Thank you.

318
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:17,041
Okay. Listen up,
you childless losers.

319
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:19,010
I need you to help me
find my kids.

320
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,412
Any of these them?
Hmm?

321
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,382
Uh... no.

322
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,816
Sorry, kids.

323
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,318
I'll place you
with your parents,

324
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:30,554
but for now, go back to making
those little drink umbrellas.

325
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,323
Homer, we'll
definitely help you,

326
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:33,658
but, uh, you're gonna
have to wait.

327
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,293
We just ordered a pie
for the bar.

328
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,730
What'd you do
that for?

329
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:43,167
Yeah, it took us 45 minutes
to choose a topping.

330
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:45,436
We decided on cheese.

331
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:51,475
Twice!

332
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:53,277
A new record.

333
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,279
We're lost.
Can you help us?

334
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,682
I'll tell my dad
about you right now.

335
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,117
Dad! Dad! Dad!

336
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,119
Cartoons.

337
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,955
Milhouse,
keep it down.

338
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,090
I got to finish
these tax returns.

339
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:07,692
Ooh, cartoons.

340
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,333
Whoa! Big dog! Big dog!
Big dog! Big dog!

341
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:21,205
I'm scared, Bart.

342
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:23,274
Once, I read a book
called <i>Jack and Jill.</i>

343
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,276
They went down a hill.

344
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,777
And broke their
crowns...!

345
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,279
Good thing we don't have crowns.

346
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,514
"Crown" means head!

347
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,083
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

348
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,058
Ta-da! I saved you!

349
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,060
Ugh! But you
pushed me!

350
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,896
Duh. I couldn't save you
until I pushed you.

351
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,732
Girls make no sense!

352
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,266
Anyway, we're even-Steven.

353
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,268
I just don't want
to fight anymore.

354
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,637
Okay. But it was always your fault.
Fine.

355
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,139
'Cause you're a jerk.

356
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,541
Can't you see I'm giving in?

357
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,444
I beat a two-year-old,
I beat a two-year-old.

00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:18,963

Homer, no!

364
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,408
I'd give anything
to have them back.

365
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,243
I don't care
about the fighting.

366
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,078
Hey, chatterbox,
there's a couple of kids

367
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,280
right there at the top
of the tire fire.

368
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,084
How did you
get up there?!

369
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,153
You know how kids
like to climb things.

370
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,554
What are we gonna do?!

371
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:45,388
They say you're supposed
to get great strength

372
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,924
when your kids
are threatened.

373
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,292
I'm kind of feeling it.

374
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:50,594
We just bought
them new shoes.

375
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,902
You did it, Homie!

376
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,975
Ah...
Ah...

377
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,884
Ice cream truck!

378
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,953
Bart! Haven't you
learned anything?

379
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:18,122
I'm still learning
our phone number.

380
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,623
And I've almost got it.

381
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,660
But in an emergency,
I'll just dial 9-1-8.

382
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,729
But the wonderful thing is,
you kids get along.

383
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,999
And we were able to have
a third beautiful child.

384
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,735
Wait. But how did you have
an extra room for Maggie?

385
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,271
Well, that's where
I used to grow my weed.

386
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,273
But that's a story
for another day.

387
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,908
Never mind, never mind.

388
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:46,904
Well, I didn't think she'd
make it, but I was wrong.

389
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:49,207
I guess your grandmother
just wants to stick around

390
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:50,908
to see those boys grow up.

Stop telling us this story!

You've had three natural
endings already!

Isn't that sweet?

398
00:20:08,961 --> 00:20:10,895
Six years ago,
they were fighting.

399
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:13,564
Now they're playing
pool in a bar.

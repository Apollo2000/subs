00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:34,767
Who wants popcorn...

5
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:36,094
‐Yay!
‐Yay!

6
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:38,663
...to string
and put on the Christmas tree?

7
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:40,041
‐Oh.
‐Ah, damn it.

8
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,952
Mom, I made an ornament
at Sunday school.

9
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:49,641
Oh, it's so...

10
00:00:49,743 --> 00:00:51,312
sticky.

11
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:54,001
The Popsicle juice represents
Jesus's blood.

12
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:58,023
That would look so pretty
on the back of the tree.

13
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:01,375
<i>Do not put on tree.</i>

14
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:03,177
<i>May occasionally do this:</i>

15
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:05,312
<i>Beep! Beep!</i>

16
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:06,586
<i>Beep!</i>

17
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:09,189
Ooh, look! An old Santa hat.

18
00:01:09,274 --> 00:01:11,384
You know who would love
to wear this?

19
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:12,524
No one.

20
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:13,930
The dog!

21
00:01:15,464 --> 00:01:17,248
Quick! Lisa, take a picture.

22
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:19,926
I don't think he wants
to take a picture.

23
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:21,813
Dogs... love...

24
00:01:21,977 --> 00:01:23,563
people clothes.

25
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,728
Did you get a good picture?

26
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:32,897
I don't think so.

27
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,916
He's afraid of it.

28
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,430
No, he's not.

29
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:55,696
Darn, we wasted
three digital photos.

30
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:59,866
Ugh. Well, suit yourself,
spoilsport.

31
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:01,508
You're out of the card!

32
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:03,360
Don't worry,
he's not out of the card.

33
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:05,897
- Can we be out of the card?
- Everyone's in the card!

34
00:02:06,047 --> 00:02:08,466
Okay, but not like last year.

Oh!

50
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:45,883
It ate my shorts!

51
00:02:45,968 --> 00:02:48,844
Oh, now that it's happened,
it's not so funny.

52
00:02:48,988 --> 00:02:51,900
Homie, we have to talk
about the difference

53
00:02:51,985 --> 00:02:55,469
between gifts
and household supplies. Hmm?

54
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:56,594
Uh-oh.

55
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:59,430
Oh, my God!

56
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,109
What's all the fu...

57
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,611
What the...

58
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:05,196
That dog better have
a good explanation!

59
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:07,016
Um... I did it.

60
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,570
Hit <i>me</i> with the newspaper.

61
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,376
You know I get my news online.

62
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:11,469
Guys...

63
00:03:11,554 --> 00:03:14,306
what is
Santa's Little Helper doing?

64
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,360
I think something
is very wrong with him.

65
00:03:17,504 --> 00:03:20,743
I think maybe we should take him
to a dog psychologist.

66
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:23,376
<i>Dog</i> psychologist, eh?

67
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,188
Get off the couch. Get off.

68
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:26,557
Get off!

69
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:29,852
Dad, I know
what you're thinking.

70
00:03:29,937 --> 00:03:31,446
It's not that.

71
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:35,077
Elaine Wolff is giving
a free lecture tomorrow night.

72
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,800
She's a legend.

73
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:38,493
Oh, not tomorrow.

74
00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:41,533
Tomorrow's UFC fight 243.

75
00:03:41,618 --> 00:03:44,430
Why do you care so much
about one stupid fight?

76
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:46,406
'Cause he paid 60 bucks
to watch it.

77
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:49,149
60 bucks to watch a fight?

78
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,686
Actually, 70. I got it in HD.

79
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:54,123
We don't even have an HDTV.

80
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:56,283
I wanted
the pay-per-view operator

81
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:58,086
to think I was a big shot.

82
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,579
He's staring at that smudge...

83
00:04:02,664 --> 00:04:04,382
smudge... smudge.

84
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,456
What's wrong with that dog...

85
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,191
dog... dog?

86
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:09,852
I need my pill...

87
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:11,388
pill... pill!

88
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,282
That's three pills!

89
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:25,449
I love playing <i>Candy Crush.</i>

90
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:29,406
Dad, I need to tell you
something,

91
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:31,632
but I've come
to the sad conclusion

92
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:34,554
that you have difficulty
hearing the female voice.

93
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:37,092
Aw, I love you, too, honey.

94
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,859
Therefore, I have deputized Bart

95
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:42,404
to speak for me.

96
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:43,974
How you doin'?

97
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:47,115
"Father, I believe
you're an honorable man."

98
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,751
Really?

99
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:50,393
Okay.

100
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,686
"In times of peril, you, um...

101
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:55,295
even... event..."

102
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,395
"Eventually."

103
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,878
"...eventually
do the right thing,

104
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:01,303
"but Santa's Little Helper
is in crisis,

105
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:04,100
and 'eventually'
may be too late."

106
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:06,186
Aw. Well said, boy.

107
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:09,615
And, Lisa, for writing it,
you win my highest honor,

108
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:12,412
a hearty Homer hug. Mm.

109
00:05:12,497 --> 00:05:13,915
Aw...

110
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:16,177
Now we party.

111
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:18,786
Ew!

112
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:20,622
Why do you eat candy that way?

113
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:23,010
- I already brushed my teeth.
- Oh.

114
00:05:30,594 --> 00:05:32,154
Good evening.

115
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:36,562
"The more I spend time
with dogs, the more I realize

116
00:05:36,647 --> 00:05:39,240
that I entirely prefer them
to people."

117
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:41,834
No, no, I'm serious.

118
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,770
I <i>really</i> despise you.

119
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:47,259
Despise us? I...
Hey, as the owner of a dog,

120
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:50,287
a tiger and a dolphin,
I am highly offended.

121
00:05:50,372 --> 00:05:51,576
Highly!

122
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:52,945
Okay, first of all,

123
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,990
I hate that you
call yourselves "owners."

124
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:58,561
You <i>own</i> living beings?

125
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,568
Nice.

126
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,068
Uh, hello?

127
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:07,975
Clayton, I can't talk right now.

128
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,225
I've left her.

129
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:11,256
I have left my wife.

130
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:12,759
What? Really?

131
00:06:12,844 --> 00:06:16,225
You and I have loved each other
since primary school.

132
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,623
She knew that,

133
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,147
so I think she was relieved.

134
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:21,701
Oh, Clay.

135
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:24,430
I'd stopped allowing myself
to hope.

136
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:27,294
But, uh... I think
I got to call you right back.

137
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:29,236
No, no! Stay on the call.

138
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,592
We're invested.

139
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:32,962
I have to go.
I'm giving a lecture.

140
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:34,272
Wait! Wait!

141
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:36,075
We're getting married, right?

142
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,644
Yeah, sure, sure,
yeah, whatever.

143
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:38,748
<i>Wait!</i>

144
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,139
Oh. Yes.

145
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:42,701
You don't deserve dogs!

146
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:44,817
They sniff out your diseases

147
00:06:44,902 --> 00:06:46,951
and comfort you
when you ride planes.

148
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:51,691
And I constantly hear:
"How do I get my dog to listen?"

149
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:54,261
- Choke him till he taps out!
- Oh, good God!

150
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:56,717
Always what can your dog
do for you.

151
00:06:56,806 --> 00:06:59,291
Never once has somebody asked:

152
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:03,514
"What is my dog trying to say?"

153
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:05,616
Bad! Bad!

154
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,719
All of you, bad!

155
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,029
This was the worst extension
class I ever took. My God.

156
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:12,858
It was even worse
than flower arranging.

157
00:07:12,943 --> 00:07:15,381
I mean, who can say
where baby's breath should go?

158
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:17,725
Huh. Not I.
Tell you that much.

159
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:19,068
Uh, ma'am...

160
00:07:19,153 --> 00:07:20,342
Down.

161
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:22,045
It's okay. We're friendly.

162
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,584
Ma'am,
I know you were once

163
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:27,381
a young,
inquisitive girl like me.

164
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:29,228
Mm, not like you, no.

165
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:30,593
I knew when to keep quiet.

166
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:33,930
Please.
My dog is having a breakdown.

167
00:07:34,015 --> 00:07:36,953
So if these tears
mean nothing to you...

168
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:40,718
...help our dog,
or let's do this!

169
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:43,332
Hold my pearls!

170
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:45,238
Look, I'm sorry,

171
00:07:45,323 --> 00:07:46,440
I just can't d...

172
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,644
Oh, my.

173
00:07:51,194 --> 00:07:52,412
You poor boy.

174
00:07:52,497 --> 00:07:54,500
You've got a story to tell.

175
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,937
Could you teach us
to do what you do?

176
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:02,921
To see the world
through his eyes?

177
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:05,197
Oh, not through his <i>eyes.</i>

178
00:08:05,282 --> 00:08:06,531
That's the point.

179
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:09,617
A dog's dominant sense is <i>smell.</i>

180
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,890
He sees the world with his nose,

181
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:16,531
and his nose sees so much more
than our eyes.

182
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:19,703
For instance, <i>we</i> see a lamppost.

183
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:24,300
Your dog sees everyone
who's ever been here.

184
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:45,987
Hmm. He really likes you.

185
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:48,206
He adores me.
Knows I can help him.

186
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:49,882
Wants me
to love him back.

187
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:51,285
But I can't.

188
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,105
A woman can only scoop
so much poop.

189
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:56,798
Stay.

190
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:58,318
Good stay.

191
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:05,070
Mm...

192
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:09,987
Come on,
get to the part that helps us.

193
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:12,348
I'm trying.
In the acknowledgements,

194
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:15,175
she thanks all 101 dalmatians!

195
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,667
Well, at least
I can wash this filthy hat.

196
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,164
Ow!

197
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,159
Bad dog! Very bad dog!

198
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:25,762
Crap dog!

199
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:30,496
Lisa, quick!
Get the first aid kit!

200
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:32,605
But we don't have
a first aid kit.

201
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,214
- Look under the tree.
- Oh.

202
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,535
Well, if <i>he's</i> staying outside,
<i>I'm</i> staying outside.

203
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,190
You are not staying outside!

204
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:47,644
You are not the boss here!

205
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:51,112
Well, I <i>am,</i> and he paid me
to tell you what to do.

206
00:09:51,197 --> 00:09:53,115
This boy is sleeping outside.

207
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:54,515
Yes, sir.

208
00:09:57,533 --> 00:10:00,722
- What are we going to do?
- Aw, no problem, sweetie.

209
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:03,323
There are a lot of dog doctors
out there.

210
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:11,716
Hey. Hello.

211
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:13,866
Oh, look at this handsome guy.

212
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:15,536
What's up with you, fella?

213
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:17,292
Um, he bit my mom.

214
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:19,534
Oh, I see.
Well, we've had a cancellation,

215
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,592
so if you like, we can
just put him down right now.

216
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:22,714
- What?!
- No!

217
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,050
I- I don't think
that's necessary.

218
00:10:25,186 --> 00:10:27,371
Oh, no, I'm afraid
once a biter always a biter.

219
00:10:27,456 --> 00:10:29,074
Unless you, like,
<i>train</i> 'em or something,

220
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:31,128
but that's... that's crazy hard.

221
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,033
Would you like a minute
to say goodbye?

222
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:34,897
No way. We're leaving.

223
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:37,597
And I don't even want
to look at you.

224
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:39,867
Hmm. I feel like the Pixar logo.

225
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:41,112
D'oh!

226
00:10:41,197 --> 00:10:43,472
What are we going to do
with the dog?

227
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:46,019
I guess he's just gonna
have to stay in the doghouse

228
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,448
I built for him.

229
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,472
D'oh!

230
00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:54,238
Hey-a, kids. The vet reported
your dog as a biter,

231
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:57,352
so I'm supposed to wait
until animal control gets here

232
00:10:57,436 --> 00:10:58,620
to take him away.

233
00:10:58,705 --> 00:10:59,972
What?

234
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:01,909
So, uh, well, while we wait,

235
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,046
uh, you want to play
Simon Says?

236
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:06,112
Simon says don't kill our dog.

237
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:07,612
Whoa, whoa, whoa, <i>I'm</i> Simon.

238
00:11:07,993 --> 00:11:09,042
You're-you're not Simon.

239
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:12,579
Dad! They're coming for our dog!

240
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:16,918
I won't let you, you...
you big blue balloon.

241
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,449
Ooh, I like the image. Hey,
imagine me in a parade, huh?

242
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:22,061
Oh, boy.

243
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:26,308
Oh, darn it.

244
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:27,982
You call them
and tell them

245
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:30,511
we are not letting you
take our dog.

246
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:33,020
I can't cancel.
They're already on the app.

247
00:11:33,105 --> 00:11:35,058
It says they're
six minutes away. See?

248
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:36,948
Uh-huh.

249
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:38,417
Oh, they missed a turn.

250
00:11:38,502 --> 00:11:39,953
Oh, now they're doing a U-ey.

251
00:11:40,038 --> 00:11:43,347
Geez, hope this guy euthanizes
better than he drives.

252
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:45,480
Dad, quick, take our dog

253
00:11:45,565 --> 00:11:47,332
and drive as far and fast
as you can.

254
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:48,856
Yes, sir.

255
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:52,324
Oh, God, it's too late.

256
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:53,839
Dr. Wolff?

257
00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:55,706
Look, I need to tell you
this one thing.

258
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:57,845
Something I saw
in your dog's eyes.

259
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,207
He's at breaking point,
and unless he has

260
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:03,718
some kind of catharsis,
something terrible could happen.

261
00:12:03,802 --> 00:12:04,956
He bit my mom.

262
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,609
It is gratifying to be right.

263
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:09,862
Oh, how awful.

264
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:12,784
Animal control is coming
to get him right now.

265
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:16,309
You can't stop them.
They got sticks with wire loops.

266
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:17,980
Kids, pack his things.

267
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:21,151
And I'll need this.
This dog is coming with me.

268
00:12:21,236 --> 00:12:23,287
Well, I am not
leaving here empty-handed.

269
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,348
- Make me a sandwich.
- No.

270
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:26,717
Okay, all right.

271
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:28,784
Being a police chief
really sucks.

272
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,181
Here you go.

273
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,608
Listen, I packed you
some biscuits.

274
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,054
And even though I deplore
the killing of all animals,

275
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:43,191
when you come to the salami,
it's from me.

276
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:47,696
Now who will chase
squirrels with me?

277
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:54,573
You better get going.

278
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:56,980
Wait. I'm not
an emotional guy, but...

279
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:01,625
Mwah.

280
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:04,905
Get a doghouse, you two.

281
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:17,124
Here. Have some Snausage water
as you watch this video.

282
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:20,335
<i>Here at the Institute,
there are no bad dogs.</i>

283
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:22,195
<i>In answer
to the age-old question,</i>

284
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,732
<i>"Who's a good dog?"
You are. You are.</i>

285
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:28,202
<i>Relax in our pile
of wet dead leaves</i>

286
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,210
<i>or enjoy fine dining
at The Dropped Porkchop.</i>

287
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:34,796
<i>And here's our guarantee
to you: no fireworks.</i>

288
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:37,213
<i>We'll have you feeling better
in no time.</i>

289
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:40,116
Well, uh, there's nothing
physically wrong with you,

290
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:43,502
but to establish trust,
I'll sleep in your den tonight.

291
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:50,975
Well, a little bit of, uh,
reading before bed?

292
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:01,706
"Dog having nightmare,

293
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:05,202
perhaps about the root
of it all."

294
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:38,163
Oh, you poor thing.

295
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:41,272
Have some Lambien.
It'll help you sleep.

296
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:50,607
Dad, am I gonna get my dog back?

297
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:52,740
Of course.

298
00:14:52,854 --> 00:14:56,405
But just in case, I know
this isn't the kind of thing

299
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,646
a father says to his son,
but let's pray.

300
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:03,513
Almighty patron saint of dogs,
Saint Bernard...

301
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:06,357
- Oh, can I join in?
- Sure.

302
00:15:06,952 --> 00:15:09,170
- I'll pray, too.
- Wow.

303
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:11,482
Losing our dog,
possibly forever,

304
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:13,264
has really brought us together.

305
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:14,622
No!

306
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:16,425
Sorry, sorry.
Back to the prayer.

307
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,935
Okay, now I need to see
what set you off.

308
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,896
How do you feel about Marge?

309
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:38,927
She is comfort. Hmm.

310
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:41,327
- So, what happened?
- Elaine?

311
00:15:41,412 --> 00:15:42,826
Hello?

312
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:46,076
The car is here. Tuscany awaits.

313
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:47,943
Oh, Clay.

314
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:49,841
Ugh, I should have called.

315
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:52,851
Darling, I've done
something impulsive.

316
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:56,255
You know how Mother always
wanted you to wear her ring,

317
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:59,420
but she died at a time
when we had no hope.

318
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:02,958
And in my heartache,
I let them bury her with it.

319
00:16:03,043 --> 00:16:07,678
So I dug her up and, uh,
will you marry me?

320
00:16:07,763 --> 00:16:09,848
I know "exhumed"

321
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:13,490
isn't usually
the most romantic word, but...

322
00:16:13,576 --> 00:16:17,272
Oh, Clay. I can't marry you now.

323
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:19,372
But I can meet you in Tuscany
in a few weeks.

324
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,810
I might not be there.

325
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:23,747
I can't compete
with a wagging tail.

326
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:25,040
Goodbye, Clay.

327
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:28,881
I want you to know
I'm already over you.

328
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:32,020
Oh, no, no, not your fault.

329
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:34,355
Human nonsense.
Let's get back to work.

330
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,730
Today, I want you
to interact with the pack.

331
00:16:42,814 --> 00:16:45,244
Mingle. Sniff a butt
you don't know.

332
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,275
Okay, interesting.

333
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:58,096
Let's explore that.

334
00:17:07,072 --> 00:17:09,416
You buried this here. Why?

335
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:12,093
Is this the key
that unlocks your psyche?

336
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:14,095
Bark once for "yes," bark twice

337
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:16,431
for "that's too simplistic
a view of canine psychology."

338
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:21,725
Oh, hi. Is that our dog?

339
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,530
Or one that looks
just like it to fool the kids?

340
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:28,401
You're back! Aw.

341
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:30,144
Where did this come from?

342
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:33,548
Uh, I would have to say
the North Pole?

343
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:35,776
Wait, Dad?
That was the hat I was wearing

344
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:38,244
the night we got
Santa's Little Helper. Remember?

345
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:40,627
- Go! Go! Come on, boy!
- Go, Santa's Little Helper!

346
00:17:40,712 --> 00:17:41,706
- Run! Run!
- Come on! Get that rabbit!

347
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,706
<i>Dog of War
coming up fast on the outside...</i>

348
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,509
Aw, can we keep him, Dad?
Please?

349
00:17:46,663 --> 00:17:49,830
But he's a loser. He's pathetic.

350
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,173
He's...

351
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:53,947
a Simpson.

352
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,922
Santa's Little Helper
was a racing dog?

353
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,636
Not much of one.
Even I could beat him.

354
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:01,025
Oh, it's all clear now.

355
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,976
Your dog has PTSD.

356
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:04,779
And he has to confront
his abuser,

357
00:18:04,863 --> 00:18:06,712
and he's gonna do it right now.

358
00:18:06,797 --> 00:18:10,361
Actually, we're in the middle
of a holiday brunch, so...

359
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:12,152
But I-I'm with you.

360
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:13,931
Uh, goodbye, everybody.

361
00:18:14,016 --> 00:18:17,689
So, how many balls are
we allowed of croquembouche?

362
00:18:19,256 --> 00:18:21,314
Let's see if they have HBO GO.

363
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:23,097
I've wanted to watch <i>Euphoria,</i>

364
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:25,611
but I'm embarrassed to have it
in my viewing history.

365
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:33,507
Les Moore? Greyhound trainer?

366
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:36,409
- Yeah, that's me.
- Dog abuser!

367
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:38,884
Can I offer you a drink
to throw in my face?

368
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:40,887
- Yeah, I'd like that.
- Yes, I bet you would.

369
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:42,767
I was being sarcastic,
naturally.

370
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:45,970
Not all trainers are monsters.

371
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:49,486
Yeah, I remember this mutt.
Uh, Santa's Little Helper.

372
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:51,447
Yeah! Hey,
what'd you rename him?

373
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:53,720
- We didn't.
- Boy, are you lazy.

374
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,751
<i>He was born to one
of the fastest in the business,</i>

375
00:18:56,859 --> 00:18:58,015
<i>She Biscuit.</i>

376
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,884
<i>Oh, he was her favorite.</i>

377
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:02,254
<i>And boy, did he love her.</i>

378
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:04,157
<i>That's how we learned
how fast he was.</i>

379
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,240
<i>So naturally, we took him
from his mother forever.</i>

380
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:09,408
<i>Did you just slap me again?</i>

381
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,578
- That was me.
- You cut the line.

382
00:19:11,663 --> 00:19:13,581
- I want to slap.
- Ow.

383
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:14,849
Ow. Ow.

384
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:16,851
- Here, Maggie.
- Ow.

385
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:18,986
There.
Now we've all had a turn.

386
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,431
Not quite.

387
00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:22,509
Ow! Okay, I get it.

388
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:26,180
Boy, suddenly, the guy who
tortures dogs is the bad guy.

389
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:30,445
Now what does he want?

390
00:19:34,252 --> 00:19:35,595
Son of a gun.

391
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,978
Where's he going?

392
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:38,298
Uh...

393
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:40,237
To his, uh, to his mother.

394
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:43,361
Oh, I love happy endings.

395
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:04,837
♪ <i>Memories</i> ♪

396
00:20:04,923 --> 00:20:08,494
♪ <i>Light the corners</i>
<i>of my mind...</i> ♪

397
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:11,097
He'll be all right now.

398
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:13,056
Thank you so much.

399
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:15,059
Oh, you're welcome.

400
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:17,645
I better be getting home.

401
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:20,573
I've got 20 dogs to walk.

402
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:23,306
I could, uh, use some help.

403
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:27,467
Fine.

404
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:35,033
It's so great everyone in this
family worked out their issues.

1
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:11,617
I'm scared, Mom.

2
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:13,052
What if they take me?

3
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:14,987
Don't worry, Barterfinger.

4
00:00:15,022 --> 00:00:16,822
You're always the last.

5
00:00:16,857 --> 00:00:20,359
Even boxes of stale raisins go
before you, Butterfinger...

6
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:21,927
I mean, Barterfinger.

7
00:00:23,497 --> 00:00:25,230
No one ever wants the apple.

8
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:28,356
They must be afraid there's
a razor blade in me.

9
00:00:28,392 --> 00:00:30,692
Yeah. That's the reason.

10
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:33,157
Maybe you'll be dipped in caramel.

11
00:00:33,193 --> 00:00:34,689
Oh, whoop-dee-doo.

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,743
What the... Where am I going?

13
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:39,878
You're going to heaven, Dad.

14
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,627
Those pearly gates
look a lot like teeth!

15
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:44,216
Change is always hard.

16
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:46,190
Well, I guess that...

17
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,465
Cigarette breath!

18
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:55,503
Oh, thank God.

19
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:57,205
We made it through the night.

20
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:02,477
And now you're on a high shelf,

21
00:01:02,512 --> 00:01:06,348
where they'll forget about you forever!

22
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:09,517
Why won't the earth take me?

23
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:11,847
I hear you, my friend.

24
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:15,090
Mmm, candy.

25
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,580
Homer, no!

26
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:18,159
Don't be silly, honey.

27
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:19,794
Chocolate doesn't feel anything.

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,663
No! God, no!

29
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:23,298
Dad...!

30
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,633
I can't listen to this horror!

31
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,968
Okay, I'm on it.

32
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:29,537
Thank you.

33

It's here! Maggie's first Pazuzu!

35
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,432
Your father ordered this because...

36
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,334
Mm, why did you order this?

37
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,169
I thought it was pizza.

38
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,904
Yeah, I'll send it back tomorrow.

39
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,206
Tonight we have a cocktail party.

40
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,041
And we came early.

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,361
And I left my face on your hand towel.

42
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:29,865
Hmm.

43
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:36,671
Don't worry, Maggie.

44
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:39,007
While Mommy and Daddy
carouse downstairs,

45
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,754

Sweet dreams, Maggie.

Don't let the Beelzebubs bite.

58
00:03:25,222 --> 00:03:27,122
Nobody's eating my chowder.

59
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:29,524
Maybe I can take it back home with me.

60
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:38,166
Maggie, sweetie, you should be in bed.

61
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,802
No one leaves alive.

62
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:43,104
Ooh, her first words!

63
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,739
Did someone get that on their phone?

64
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:46,908
Aw, she's got red eye.

65
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:48,877
She's a demon from hell!

66
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:50,779
Also, generic cola?

67
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,080
Really?

68
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:53,782
Cocktail fail.

69
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:56,217
Thank you.

70
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,227
Well, at least we still got the liquor.

71
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,401
Ah, my chowder!

72
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:15,470
Someone's starting the terrible twos.

73
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:19,574
Someone's having an
affair with his nurse.

74
00:04:20,811 --> 00:04:24,045
- Say "ah."
- A... dulterer.

75
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:26,247
179? I...

76
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:32,988
I'm afraid that little
devil needs an exorcism.

77
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:36,257
I'm afraid they didn't teach
me those at Pepperdine.

78
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:40,261
Bible ribbons, that'll hold her.

79
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:46,601
Oh, good, the police are here.

80
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:53,508
When is that exorcist gonna get here?

81
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,976
Marge, we'll be fine.

82
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:57,078
Maggie just learned what a circle is.

83
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,583
Okay, whoever she stops at
has to change her diaper,

84
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:03,918
which appears to contain flaming lava.

85
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:06,554
Oh, you just never want
to change a diaper.

86
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,524
I'll handle this.

87
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:23,805
Oops. Sorry about that.

88
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,540
First thing, we'll see just how powerful

89
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,876
our demon here truly is.

90
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,744
The chicken goes...

91
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:35,283
Well, there's only one answer here,

92
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:37,819
- cut her loose!
- Are you sure?

93
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:40,021
If you can't trust a Catholic
priest with a child,

94
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:41,289
who can you trust?

95
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:53,968
By the power of Christ,
I say devil be out!

96
00:05:54,004 --> 00:05:55,637
That's all you've got?

97
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:57,305
Well, I say it three times.

98
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,540
This guy's good.

99
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:00,141
Devil be out!

100
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:05,513
I am Pazuzu, demon of
the southwest wind.

101
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:08,883
Wait, wait, so you're not even
as powerful as the south wind

102
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:10,351
or the west wind?

103
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:11,920
How lame is that?

104
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,421
I used to be very important.

105
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,689
Google it.

106
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:16,524
Devil be out!

107
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,027
Google it!

108
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:27,102
Your baby is saved.

109
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,937
Fantastic.

110
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,372
She's not going to be a
religious weirdo, is she?

111
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:33,241
- No.
- Fantastic.

112
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:34,509
Now hush.

113
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:36,678
Pazuzu is still among us.

114
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:38,012
But where?

115
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:41,349
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

116
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:42,650
Bart?

117
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:44,452
Let me out, let me out!

118
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,188
This boy has the darkest
soul I've ever seen.

119
00:06:47,224 --> 00:06:50,091
It's worse than working
for David Schwimmer!

120
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:53,361
Yo, Pazuzu, grow me some horns.

121
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:57,499
Those aren't horns, those are nubs.

122
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:00,068
No, no, no!

123
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:02,770
Well, at least it'll get
me out of jury duty.

124
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,930
♪ Lisa, Lisa wants a better life ♪

125
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:15,700

127

So, anyone want to pick up
litter at the park today?

128
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,111
How about you, Maggie?

129
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,280
She's still got a touch of Pazuzu.

130
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,848
At least she never threw up.

131
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,691
That's just great.

132
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,826
Everywhere but the sink.

133
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,664
Sometimes I think I was
born in the wrong family.

134
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,766
Oh? Hey, Mr. Cat.

135
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,269
What are you playing with?

136
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,038
A secret door?

137
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:56,041
We don't have smoke
alarms, but we have this?

138
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,677
Smoke is its own alarm.

139
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:01,305
No, no, Snowball, come back!

140
00:08:01,307 --> 00:08:03,307
It's too dangerous!

141
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:10,221
Sometimes tiny doors lead
to big opportunities.

142
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,291
- You could talk?
- Indeed.

143
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:16,061
For centuries, the cat has been
the symbol of intelligence,

144
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,829
the other world savoir faire...

145
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,397
Ooh, shiny!

146
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,399
Oh, there it is. Where'd it go?

147
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,168
There it is. Where'd it go?

148
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,903
There it is. Where'd it go?

149
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,237
Enough.

150
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,406
Let's go meet your other family.

151
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,742
Other family?

152
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:34,679
Already the talking cat isn't
the most interesting thing.

153
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:44,622
Whoa! For a Halloween show
middle segment, this is amazing.

154
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:52,397
Every girl's dream, a perfect family.

155
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,702
Good morning, sleepyhead.

156
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,171
For breakfast, tofu or kale?

157
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,006
Oh, that's nice.

158
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,875
But what's with the button eyes?

159
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,378
We don't all have button eyes, silly.

160
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,079
Some have button mouths.

161
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,881
What's up?!

162
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,218
Lisa, would you like to jam with us?

163
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,719
You like jazz?

164
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,885
You're all good, but not better than me.

165
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,904
I wish I could stay forever.

166
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,773
Oh, but you can.

167
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,278
All right. Let me guess.

168
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:40,385
Do you have to sew buttons over my eyes?

169
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:42,054
Don't worry, sugar plum,

170
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:43,889
we'll give you a button to bite on

171
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:45,491
while we sew 'em on.

172
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:47,826
Hold steady.

173
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:53,165
Oh, sweetie, you're just in time.

174
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,967
I killed a snake with
your saxophone and...

175
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:56,301
Can you blow its head out?

176
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:58,804
Here, let me just wipe the
blood off the mouthpiece.

177
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:00,606
Buttons, please.

178
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:06,178
Hmm, something's missing.

179
00:10:06,213 --> 00:10:09,548
Didn't we have a kid
between Bart and the baby?

180
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,518
Little smarty pants, plays
the flute, I think.

181
00:10:12,553 --> 00:10:14,853
Lisa. She's been gone for days.

182
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,822
And the police have been no help.

183
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:19,791
That's not true. I helped you
reassemble that high chair.

184
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:22,861
Damn it!

185
00:10:27,134 --> 00:10:29,868
Well, we got two kids
now, so no favoritism.

186
00:10:29,904 --> 00:10:33,026
Maggie will get Lisa's room,
Maggie will get Lisa's clothes,

187
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:34,572
Bart will get Lisa's homework.

188
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:37,209
Cowabunga!

189
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:40,546
Bart! How'd you find me?

190
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:42,267
I had an informant.

191
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:44,149
I know, he can talk.

192
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:46,251
He can? I just followed him in.

193
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:49,321
Oh, God. Now I'll have to talk to him.

194
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:52,558
Uh, I don't think he's coming back.

195
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:54,393
How can you be so calm?

196
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:56,428
I bore both those children.

197
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:59,620
Hey, your stories aren't great,
but I wouldn't call them boring.

198
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:00,687
Oh.

199
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:02,601
I'm going in there now.

200
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:07,990
You really did it this time, Homer.

201
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:09,859
You lost your family.

202
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:12,162
Wait, you can speak on this side?

203
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:13,863
Yes, I just don't like to.

204
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:15,565
Makes the dog feel inferior.

205
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:17,834
All right.

206
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:21,171
Oh! So tight.

207
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:24,007
Why did I eat that
second lunch at lunch?

208
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:25,875
Someone kick me in the ass!

209
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:27,477
Thank you!

210
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:32,549
What is it about this
world that's so great?

211
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:35,385
The Homer in this world
doesn't pass gas.

212
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,954
That was a three-button job.

213
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,190
Would you like to have two eyes?

214
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:42,859
We can talk to each other
while you watch TV.

215
00:11:42,894 --> 00:11:46,129
Just what Homer needs,
an excuse to get lazier.

216
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,597
Why, you little...

217
00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:51,801
I'll lazy you, you otherworldly...

218
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,937
- What the...
- That was my Bart!

219
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:57,207
Boy, sure is hard to see
with buttons on your eyes.

220
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:59,209
D'oh!

221
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:01,244
You killed my husband!

222
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:06,716
Spider wife, dead son, two
girls with button eyes?

223
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:09,753
I think this marriage has
finally gotten out of its rut.

224
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:15,425
Yep, I got everything
just the way I want it,

225
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,561
including an extra me to go to
parent-teacher conferences.

226
00:12:18,597 --> 00:12:21,765
Oh! Bart drew this
picture of his family.

227
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,967
Now we're getting visits
from a social worker

228
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:25,502
and an exterminator.

229
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,003
I'll be ready.

230
00:12:28,473 --> 00:12:31,074
And I've learned, no
matter how bad things are,

231
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:34,010
they can get much, much worse.

232
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,030
Huh, you're telling me.

233
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:38,836
Haw... haw.

234
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,629
No one will be seated
during the third act

235
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,331
of this Halloween show.

236
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,200
What you're about to
see is so disgusting

237
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,070
you'll watch Game of
Thrones to calm down.

238
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,005
You have been warned.

239
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,821
Man, am I jealous of you guys.

240
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,857
Two weeks in Lima, Ohio,
with Patty and Selma

241
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,926
while I'm stuck here working.

242
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,829
It's gonna be lonely. So lonely.

243
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,931
Well, if you really want us to stay...

244
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,066
We've already kissed good-bye
and the car heard it!

245
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,706
They're gone. Not a second to waste.

254
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,115
Not a single morsel in the house!

255
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,419
A forgotten hot dog.

256
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,255
Oh, you're shivering.

257
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,990

Now to slit it down the middle.

261
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,134
I'm not splitting it with you.

262
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,203
I'm just teaching you how it's done.

263
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,641
Still frozen.

264
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,678
My finger!

265
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,213
My hot dog!

266
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,653
My finger! My poor...

267
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,789
delicious finger.

268
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,658
Wait a minute.

269
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,860
I can't eat my own finger. It's unholy.

270
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,395
Also, it's not quite done.

271
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,531
But sometimes a man has
to do the unthinkable,

272
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,935
like eat something medium-rare.

273
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,936
Oh!

274
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,673

275
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,475

278
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,211
Hmm?

279
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:19,469
Hmm.

280
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,889
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

281
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,924
It makes complete sense.

282
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,728
I eat more and exercise less
than the most succulent pig.

283
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,297
Of course I'm delicious!

284
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:37,034
But I must never eat me again. Never!

285
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,404
On the other hand is my other finger.

286
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,973
And one thing I love is consistency.

287
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:48,375
Hey, there, Homer Aloner.

288
00:15:48,377 --> 00:15:51,512
In the absence of the missus,
you want something delicious?

289
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,584
Don't worry, I'll be back.

290
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:05,392
Oh. Ooh, yuck.

291
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:07,094
Oh, disgusting.

292
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:09,730
Homer Simpson, you don't
like steak anymore?

293
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:13,033
Actually, I've become a bit of a me-gan.

294
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:15,836
Do you have any spaghetti
with my-balls? Uh, meatballs?

295
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:17,771
"Me-gan? My-balls?"

296
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:20,274
Are you eating forbidden fruit?

297
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:22,376
Fruit? Ugh.

298
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:27,248
Sorry, Flanders,

299
00:16:27,283 --> 00:16:30,751
but I've got more delicious
meat in my little finger

300
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:33,087
than you have on this
whole picnic table.

301
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:34,421
Speaking of which...

302
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:07,221
I have really gone to a lot of trouble

303
00:17:07,256 --> 00:17:08,989
not to leave the house.

304
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:10,758
Homie, we're home!

305
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:14,228
What's with the gloves?

306
00:17:14,263 --> 00:17:17,498
Uh, I was watching
Breakfast at Tiffany's,

307
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,767
and I thought I could be more elegant.

308
00:17:19,802 --> 00:17:22,102
Elegant? With your waistline?

309
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:23,971
I don't think so.

310
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:27,908
Actually, Homer, you look
like you've lost 20 pounds.

311
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:29,944
Well, I have been cutting back.

312
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:31,946
That means something
different to me than you.

313
00:17:31,981 --> 00:17:33,280
What's wrong with your leg?

314
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:35,583
Nothing. It was perfect.

315
00:17:43,526 --> 00:17:47,361
Homie, you shouldn't be snacking
in the middle of the night.

316
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:48,495
It can't be good for your...

317
00:17:53,903 --> 00:17:56,370
This is, without question,

318
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:59,640
the worst moment of our entire marriage.

319
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:01,041
- What about...
- This is worse.

320
00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:02,643
Opa!

321
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:05,212
Marge, I admit it,
this is a rough patch.

322
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:06,780
But I know when to stop.

323
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:09,316
And when would that be?
When you're just a mouth?

324
00:18:09,352 --> 00:18:11,685
You see how she is,
Doc? Always negative.

325
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,153
She makes me feel like nothing.

326
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:15,489
You are almost nothing!

327
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:17,057
Almost nothing.

328
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:19,827
Homer, have you considered
your wife's feelings?

329
00:18:19,862 --> 00:18:21,996
Perhaps she takes this new diet of yours

330
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:23,697
as a comment on her cooking.

331
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:24,999
Marge?

332
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:27,234
I won't deny that's a part of it.

333
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,569
See? Progress.

334
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:29,737
Now, excuse me.

335
00:18:29,772 --> 00:18:32,806
I need to go get famous
talking about you.

336
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:35,376
Homie, I'm afraid this is it.

337
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:39,179
Your self-destructive
behavior has gone too far.

338
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:40,981
But, Marge...

339
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:43,250
Good-bye, my love.

340
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:48,222
Maybe, deep down, that's
why I ate myself...

341
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:50,524
Because I hate myself.

342
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,394
Sounds like someone had a breakthrough.

343
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:55,863
Hi. I'm famous
cooker-upper Mario Batali.

344
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:58,399
- You mean "chef"?
- I don't care for that term.

345
00:18:58,434 --> 00:19:01,402
Well, I know I don't belong
in therapy, but why are you?

346
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:03,504
I got depressed because I ran out

347
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,172
of exciting new ingredients.

348
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,841
Homer, we need to talk.

349
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:09,710
Could we wok and talk?

350
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:11,145
Well, sure.

351
00:19:20,122 --> 00:19:23,257
My dearest family, I love you so much.

352
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:26,427
And I think I've found a way
to earn your forgiveness.

353
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:28,062
Please come home.

354
00:19:28,097 --> 00:19:30,064
Come home to flavor.

355
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:40,908
He wanted me to pass
on these final words.

356
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:42,376
"I've failed as a man,

357
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:44,445
but I have succeeded as an ingredient."

358
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,579
I call the brain!

359
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:48,949
Ah.

360
00:19:48,984 --> 00:19:50,918
He's gone.

361
00:19:50,953 --> 00:19:55,422
Well, I guess I can be proud
that he succeeded at something.

362
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,458
Oh, it's a lot more than something.

363
00:19:57,493 --> 00:20:00,094
Homer's the biggest thing
in food since free refills.

364
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,464
♪ Hey, you ate you ♪

365
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:05,632
♪ You tasted great, you ♪

366
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:07,668
♪ Hey, you ate you, hey, you ate you ♪

367
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:09,670
♪ You cooked and ate you. ♪

368
00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:11,839
How did they get so
much meat out of Homer?

369
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:15,075
Well, they mixed in some Barney,
Comic Book Guy and horse.

370
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:16,510
Horse?!

371
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:20,536
Do you know what it's
like to have everyone

372
00:20:20,564 --> 00:20:21,897
eat of your body?

373
00:20:21,932 --> 00:20:23,857
Yeah, like, every Sunday, pal.

374
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:27,601
Uh, you know, you don't
get more of those.

375
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:32,749

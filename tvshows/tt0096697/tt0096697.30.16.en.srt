- ...must be...
- Fully sighted.

- ...and...
- Not marrying her

to harvest her organs.

138

00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:11,030
Oh, right. That's me.

00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:12,824
D.R. Heffernan.

141
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:14,325
- That's "Doctor."
- Right.

142
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:16,035
Dr. D.R. Heffernan.

143
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:18,037
The keynote speech

144
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:21,291
What's a keynote speech?

145
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:24,419
Imagine Dr. Heffernan asking me
what a keynote speech is.

146
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,586
This way.

147
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:27,463
Finally, things are looking up

148
00:06:27,464 --> 00:06:29,716
for the person
I'm pretending to be.

149
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:33,761
And the number one
new wedding trend is...

150
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:35,763
True love!

151
00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:38,766
True love! True love!

152
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:41,853
Buy our book if we have one.

153
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:44,606
I'm starting to think
that's not Dr. Heffernan.

154
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:50,236
What a...

155

...perfect night.

158
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:01,581
I'm not paying you!

159
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:03,167
Get out of my house!

160
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,754
-Later.
-And now, my lady,
to the boudoir,

161
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:11,007
which I believe
is somewhere near the bedroom.

162
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:11,925
Ooh!

163
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:13,760
Ooh!

164
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,179
Have I picked you up yet?

165

Perfect end to...

169
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:26,064
perfect night!

170
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:28,441
Voulez-vous coucher avec...

171
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:34,364
- What the?!
- Ow!

172
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,577
I guess
we should stop listening now.

173
00:07:39,578 --> 00:07:40,829
No one's making you stay.

174
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:48,127
Marge, I'm afraid your days
of walking are over.

175
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:49,253
Oh, my God!

176
00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:51,214
For about 36 hours.

177
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:53,716
By then, this mild ankle sprain
should be good as new.

178
00:07:53,717 --> 00:07:55,593
It's my fault.

179
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:58,971
Homie wouldn't have dropped me
if I hadn't put on a few pounds.

180
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:02,016
Nonsense. It's not your fault
you're married to a...

181
00:08:02,017 --> 00:08:03,851
this.

182
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:08,106
And it was such
a good date night.

183
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:09,941
Well, now it's a hernia morning.

184
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:12,527
See, you've got a tear
in your abdominal wall

185
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:15,154
and a section of your intestine
has pushed through.

186
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:17,115
Aren't you going to chuckle?

187
00:08:17,116 --> 00:08:19,117
An inguinal hernia
is no laughing matter.

188
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:21,577
"Inguinal."

189
00:08:21,578 --> 00:08:23,371
Will I need surgery?

190
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:24,997
Possibly. But don't be alarmed.

191
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:27,125
It's just some scalpel work
around your scrotum.

192
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:31,337
A little more.

193
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:33,131
Little more.

194
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:35,258
Little more...

195
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:37,135
No, those are the wipers!

196
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:39,429
Oh, you just called OnStar.

197
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,556
Now, look, you two,
you're not kids anymore.

198
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:43,558
Listen to your body.
It'll tell you what to do.

199
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:47,019
OnStar operator.

200
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,354
What is your emergency?

201
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:50,648
Every comedian
I thought is funny

202
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:52,400
is dead.

203
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:56,028
♪ The Itchy and Scratchy Show! ♪

204
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:57,989
Hmm. "Possible side effects

205
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,366

206
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:02,702

"Do not mix with alcohol"?

210
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:12,837
Fine, I'll drink it separately.

211
00:09:12,838 --> 00:09:14,256
Boy, get me a beer.

212
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:20,052
Huh? What are you doing?

213
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:21,095
Helping you get better.

214
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:22,513
I was watching Animal Planet,

215
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:24,223
and they said,
if it can't reach its own food,

216
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:25,850
the hippo dies.

217
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:26,976
Why, you little...!

218
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:31,272
Bart, honey,
your father and I need you

219
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:33,274
to be a little more grown-up.

220
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:34,317
Can you do that?

221
00:09:34,318 --> 00:09:35,860
I bet you can.

222
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:37,488
You got it, Mom.

223
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,244
Honey, I signed us up for
physical therapy this afternoon.

224
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:47,038
They sound terrific.

225
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,623
Even booking the appointment,

226
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:50,583
they told me, "Great job."

227
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:51,959
Absolutely.

228
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,127
I want to get better.

229
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:54,378
I really do.

230
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:55,546
I know you do.

231
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:56,923
We'll start tomorrow.

232
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:59,050
Mwah.

233
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:01,177
I would caution
against physical therapy.

234
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:04,056
Guys like us
don't look good in shorts.

235
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:09,143
Oh, why is it never hair growth?

236
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:12,063
It's me, your hernia.

237
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:15,066
Homer, your doctor told you
to listen to your body.

238
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:16,317
And I am telling you,

239
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:18,861
just take it easy.

240
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:19,696
Are you sure?

241
00:10:19,697 --> 00:10:21,656
I just promised Marge.

242
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:24,075
Take it from your hernia.

243
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:29,497
Oh, you've got this, Marge!

244
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,290
Now, focus on your co-ah.

245
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,960
I guess I've been
neglecting my key-aah.

246
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:35,461
Is it this?

247
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:38,089
No. All I can say is,
if you have a muscle

248
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,342
and you know what it does,
then that is not the co-ah.

249
00:10:41,343 --> 00:10:43,094
Oh, the core.

250
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:44,679
Right, that's
what I said-- co-ah.

251
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,640
Now, what sports are we
gettin' you ready for, Marge?

252
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,642
Rollerblading? Uh, Muay Thai?

253
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:51,978
No, nothing like that.

254
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:54,021
I only have to be
in good enough shape

255
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:57,650
to take care
of an immobile 240-pound man.

256
00:10:57,651 --> 00:10:59,443
Ah, so Homer isn't coming, eh?

257
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:01,696
You know,
I could go to him at work.

258
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:03,949
Oh, he's got
enough stress at work.

259
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:08,160
All right, well,
we'll get you into something.

260
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:10,413
Uh, mountain biking?
Free bouldering?

261
00:11:10,414 --> 00:11:15,084
I got it. Marge, we are going
to get you kitesurfing!

262
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:16,419
Kitesurfing?

263
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,422
I could do that with Homie.

264
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:26,887
You know what?

265
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:29,682
I'm not letting Homer
drag me down this time.

266
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:32,685
Yes, I want to learn
kitesurfing.

267
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:34,020
♪ Let's go kitesurfing now ♪

268

270
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:39,233
Kitesurfing's a simple sport.

271
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:41,569
All you need is
the wind and the waves.

272
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,323
And a spreader-bar, bindings,
impact vest, chicken loop,

273
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:47,783
donkey stick, squirrel clip,
and, of course, parking pass.

274
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:51,787
Yeah, ruining
people's day at the beach.

275
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:54,749
We are worse than sand
in a hot dog, eh, Lou?

276
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,417
You know there's
a double murder downtown?

277
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:59,420
Well, now it's a triple,
'cause you just killed my day.

278
00:11:59,421 --> 00:12:00,963
Keep the kite swooping, Marge.

279
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:02,965
Follow the timing of my pecs.

280
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:05,009
Left, right, left, right,

281
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,218
left, left, right...

282
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:08,304
Ah. Don't look me
in the eyes, Marge.

283
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:09,847
My pecs are down here.

284
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:11,349
There you are.

285
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,477
Left, right,
left, left, right...

286
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:17,063
So, Mom is kitesurfing

287
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:19,273
while Dad is eating
three desserts.

288
00:12:19,274 --> 00:12:22,860
Oh, your grandma and I
had our differences,

289
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:27,198
but we stopped arguing when she
disappeared for three decades.

290
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:28,283
Oh.

291
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:30,451
Oh, it's so nice

292
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:32,495
to get an evening out
just with you.

293
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:34,121
Can I get you a baby chair?

294
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:35,331
No? You're good?

295
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:36,874
Homer's-a talking to nobody.

296
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,126
The Cat Lady
is eating with cats.

297
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:41,212
Ralph is in-a the lobster tank?

298
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:43,130
I'm expensive.

299
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:45,091
Homer, you're doing great.

300
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:47,635
Look at those guys--
eating half portions,

301
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,762
trying to stay fit.

302
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:52,556
They're just setting
themselves up to meet my buddies

303
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:55,893
Torn ACL and Pinched Nerve.

304
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:57,395
Now, you, you're smart.

305
00:12:57,396 --> 00:12:59,855
The most strenuous thing
you're gonna do

306
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:02,900
is fart
"The Star Spangled Banner."

307
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:04,944
Mm, that's got
a difficult range.

308
00:13:04,945 --> 00:13:07,071
Is there an easier anthem?

309
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:11,158
Hey, the riskiest thing
we're gonna do is have lasagna.

310
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,077
We just had lasagna.

311
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:14,328
Have it again!

312
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:16,038
Nobody's gonna stop you.

313
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,666
I love you.

314
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:21,544
Who are you?

315
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:24,172
Cirrhosis. What's it to ya?

316
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:30,094
Homer, I'm going to the beach.

317
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:32,555
I packed lunch for two
if you want to come.

318
00:13:32,556 --> 00:13:33,973
Oh, the beach.

319
00:13:33,974 --> 00:13:35,933
Sure. Let's get sunstroke,

320
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:38,269
a hyperextended tendon,

321
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,897
and wrap it up by getting
decapitated by a Frisbee.

322
00:13:41,898 --> 00:13:43,733
Hard pass.

323
00:13:43,734 --> 00:13:45,943
Sorry, Marge. Hard pass.

324
00:13:45,944 --> 00:13:49,238
It's been so long
since you made a move on me.

325
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:51,115
Or any move.

326
00:13:51,116 --> 00:13:53,534
Um, how about
if I drone you a kiss?

327
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:00,791
Hurry up, Marge.

328
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,877
We're gonna catch big air
all morning,

329
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:05,796
sleep all afternoon,
then boil a sheep for breakfast.

330
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:08,007
I'm still on New Zealand time.

331
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:10,426
Been here 12 years
but can't shake it.

332
00:14:10,427 --> 00:14:13,012
Please, Homer,
you're my husband.

333
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:15,264
Get up and live.

334
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:18,058
Sorry, Marge.
I got to go with my gut.

335
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:25,609
If you don't come after me,
there's a big problem.

336
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:29,029
The drone doesn't count.

337
00:14:34,117 --> 00:14:37,161
Hey. Can you watch the kids
this afternoon?

338
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:38,746
Sorry, Marge.

339
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,289
Hernia.

340
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,999
We make quite a team.

341
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,751
Who are you talking to?

342
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:46,086
Hey, I do not have voices
in my head.

343
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:47,671
They're in my crotch.

344
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:49,423
Ooh!

345
00:14:49,424 --> 00:14:52,469
Just call my sisters
to watch the kids.

346
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:57,223
Let's drop him in the woods

347
00:14:57,224 --> 00:14:59,184
and see if he can
find his way back.

348
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:05,606
Our parents are drifting apart.

349
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:08,192
And as much as
I don't enjoy doing this,

350
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:10,903
I need the advice
of the only couple we know

351
00:15:10,904 --> 00:15:12,947
that seems to like each other.

352
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:14,281
I'm stuck with you.

353
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:16,992
Relationships
are simple, really.

354
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:19,370
Like, if Shauna's best friend
Tiffany comes on to me,

355
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:21,205
I make out with Shauna,

356
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:23,332
but I pretend it's her friend.

357
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,458
Aw.

358
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:27,670
Tiffany. Oh, yeah.

359
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:29,213
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

360
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:31,382
Guys. Guys, guys, guys.
Let's focus!

361
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:32,383
Focus.

362
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:34,552
Please give me something useful.

363
00:15:34,553 --> 00:15:37,054
Okay. Your parents
have just got to find

364
00:15:37,055 --> 00:15:39,098
something they both like doing.

365
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:41,100
Like, I like laughing at losers.

366
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:43,936
And I make losers happen.

367
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:51,026
Common interests!

368
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:52,028
Of course.

369
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:57,199
Back now to live coverage

370
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,994
of Little XII college golf
on ESPN-D3-2,

371
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:03,289
your second home
for Division III sports.

372
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,416
Dad, can you drive us
down to the beach?

373
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:08,252
I have a school project on...
sea turtles.

374
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:10,171
Don't listen to them.

375
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:13,507
You can see me?!

376
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:15,677
It's always the babies.

377
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:22,850
Hey. Where are the turtles?

378
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,935
There are no turtles, Homer.
It's a trick.

379
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:27,938
These kids are trying to help
you, 'cause they love you.

380
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:31,233
So there never were turtles?

381
00:16:31,234 --> 00:16:32,276
No turtles!

382
00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:33,736
I'm starting to think

383
00:16:33,737 --> 00:16:36,363
there were no turtles.

384
00:16:36,364 --> 00:16:37,782
Marge.

385
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,618
She looks so beautiful.

386
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:42,578
I've been such a fool.

387
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:46,081
And you forgot to get
a parking pass. Heh.

388
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:47,959
Our work is done, Lou.

389
00:16:49,502 --> 00:16:50,754
Oh...

390
00:16:56,593 --> 00:16:59,511
I'll never let
myself go like that!

391
00:16:59,512 --> 00:17:01,431
I'm-a comin', Marge!

392
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:04,267
Ew! Gross!

393
00:17:06,102 --> 00:17:08,312
Homer, you're making me mad.

394
00:17:08,313 --> 00:17:11,023
And if there's one thing
you don't want to aggravate,

395
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:13,026
it's a hernia!

396
00:17:17,113 --> 00:17:19,114
I'm Marge's husband, Homer.

397
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:20,991
Homer! Good-o!

398
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:22,910
Would you like me
to rehab you at work?

399
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:25,454
I could come right to you.
Same price.

400
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:28,666
Maybe. But now I need
your biggest, fastest kite.

401
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:29,833
- The Widdamaka?
- What?

402
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:31,752
Can you say that
without an accent?

403
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:33,921
The Widowmaker.
- Oh! That's scary!

404
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:35,923
- Back to the accent!
- The Widdamaka.

405
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:37,049
I'll take it!

406
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,218
When I got married,
I took a vow:

407
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:40,844
"Something, something, something

408
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:42,722
till death something."

409
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:49,478
Homer! Rooster your gimbal!

410
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:50,813
Rooster your gimbal!

411
00:17:50,814 --> 00:17:52,231
What does that mean?!

412
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:53,650
Pull the rope!

413
00:17:55,402 --> 00:17:56,861
The other rope.

414
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:00,948
Homie!

415
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:02,408
You came for me!

416
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:04,410
And I'll never leave you.

417
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:06,704
Except right now
when the wind blows me

418
00:18:06,705 --> 00:18:08,414
God knows where....

419
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:10,792
They're headed for a wind farm!

420
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,296
Whoa...!

421
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:19,133
Whoa...!

422
00:18:20,218 --> 00:18:22,137
Whoa...!

423
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:28,892
Well, Mother,
looks like we caught

424
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:30,853
a couple more kiteboarders.

425
00:18:30,854 --> 00:18:33,897
- I'll get the big ladder.
- I'll tell the hospital

426
00:18:33,898 --> 00:18:36,901
their power's gonna be down
for a while.

427
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:40,946
Strong woman, I love you.

428
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:43,741
And I love you.

429
00:18:43,742 --> 00:18:46,869
And never again
will I listen to a doctor.

430
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,079
Wait, that's not the takeaway.

431
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,998
Takeaway?
That's a good idea!

432
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:53,250
Yello? Pizza Palace?

433
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:55,169
Can I get
a Henry the Eight-Inch Pizza

434
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,420
with extra meat?

435
00:18:56,421 --> 00:18:58,672
And a side
of chocolate cheesy bread?

436
00:18:58,673 --> 00:19:00,090
No such thing.

437
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:01,760
Can you make it anyways?

438
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,140
Chief, I've got to make dinner
for my kids. Could you please

439
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:10,893
- tell me what this is about?
- Like most physical therapists

440
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:14,730
in America, this man
is actually a Russian spy.

441
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:16,982
Nigel is a spy?

442
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:18,400
Dimitri Nigelovonovitch.

443
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:20,819
Did you ever wonder
why he was so interested

444
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,780
in seeing your husband at work?

445
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:24,948
I thought
it was close to his house.

446
00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:28,202
Didn't you ever ask yourself
how a beach bum like him

447
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:31,538
could afford a top-of-the-line
2007 Saturn SUV

448
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:33,373
with a full spare tire?

449
00:19:33,374 --> 00:19:35,709
I guess I didn't want to know.

450
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,881
Just thank God, thank God your
husband is entrapping him now.

451
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:44,760
Homer, I just need
a few pictures of...

452
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:46,428
the co-ah.

453
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:48,430
- The what?
- Goo-ah.

454
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:51,266
- The car?
- Goo-ah.

455
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,393
Like a crow? Caw?

456
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:55,062
Co-ahr-car?

457
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:58,232
Damn it.
Show me your reactor core.

458
00:19:58,233 --> 00:19:59,984

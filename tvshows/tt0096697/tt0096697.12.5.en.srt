305
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,675
Why, it most certainly is!

306
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,238
Mr. Costington, something quite
wonderful has happened.

307
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,318
Uh, no. Uh, no.

308
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,353
Uh, yes!

309
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,088
Why, I don't think
I've ever seen such generosity.

310
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,159
You're a modern day
Kriss Kringle, sir.

311
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,286
I'm just trying to dig myself
out of a pit of shame.

312
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:48,196
Say no more. I've had a bit of
a shoe-sniffing problem myself.

313
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,962
I'm still not allowed
on the third floor.

314
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,004
It's okay.

315
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,073
Mr. Simpson, I just had
a crazy thought.

316
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,041
We do a little Thanksgiving Day
parade around here...

317
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:01,943
and you're about the right build
for a little fella they call Kriss Kringle.

318
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,914
- Hold still.
- I'm so proud.

319
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,384
My dad will be the grand finale
of the Thanksgiving Day parade.

320
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,684
- Wanna rehearse, Dad?
- I don't need to rehearse.

321
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,953
Ho, ho, ho! Merry-

322
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,960
- Line.
- <i>Christmas.</i>

323
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,962
Wha-
Let me see that.

324
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,965
Well, looks like another beautiful
80-degree Thanksgiving Day...

325
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,967
thanks to global warming.

326
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,937
- Isn't that right, Leeza Gibbons?
- That's right, Kent Brockman.

327
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,942
Our broadcast is brought to you today
by Costington's department store...

328
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,944
the thing downtown
that's open...

329
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,980
right next to
the men's shelter.

Ah, Springfield gets
the lamest balloons.

332
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,088
Are you kidding?
There's Funky Winkerbean!

333
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,660
Over here, Funky!
[Gasps]

334
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:53,754
Look, it's the Noid.
Avoid the Noid. He ruins pizzas.

335
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,835
Hey, lady.
Santa Claus is gonna be here, right?

336
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,132
- He just has to.
- Something tells me he is.

337
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,901
Don't touch me!
Nothing gives you that right!

338
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:06,375
- Say, Leeza. Do you like gingerbread?
- No, not really.

339
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,378
Well, then you'll love
this next float.

Prepare to be boarded.

346
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,769
What are you doing here?
I told you. I'm not your monkey anymore.

347
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,642
Silence, monkey. Now that
you're Father Christmas...

348
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,216
we have an opportunity
to bend this town over our knee...

349
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,217
and give it a pranking
it will never forget.

- Here's what we do. [Whispering]
- [Gasps]

They're good sports.

355
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:08,672
The answer is no, Mr. Burns.
Not for any amount of money.

356
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,674
Not for one million dollars?

everyone's been waiting for.

361

Yes. Whether you're Christian or just non-Jewish,
everybody loves Santa Claus.

That is not candy.

What did I do?

Ah, the doctor said I could take
this patch off five minutes a day.

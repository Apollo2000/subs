1
00:00:02,875 --> 00:00:05,203
- Good Morning!
- Hi, Twyla.

2
00:00:05,242 --> 00:00:08,210
I hear congratulations
are in order, Mrs. Rose.

3
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:10,685
Thank you, dear, for what?

4
00:00:10,953 --> 00:00:12,468
Oh, should I not say anything yet?

5
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:14,965
Well, you could say something,
think of it as a clue.

6
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:17,140
Not say something about what?

7
00:00:17,237 --> 00:00:19,437
Your wife's big announcement.

8
00:00:19,597 --> 00:00:21,218
Again dear, clue!

9
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:24,257
- You running for town council!
- What, excuse me?

10
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:26,093
You're running for town council?

11
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:28,375
No, I'm not running for town council.

12
00:00:28,415 --> 00:00:30,515
Oh, I must've misheard.

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,984
Everyone was talking about
you standing up to council

14
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:35,125
last week, so I just assumed...

15
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,250
Never assume, dear, It makes
an ass out of both of us.

16
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:40,359
It's not that absurd an idea, Moira.

17
00:00:40,384 --> 00:00:43,678
You know, being on town
council might give you an outlet

18
00:00:43,703 --> 00:00:44,859
to channel all that...

19
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:47,555
"passion" you have for this town.

20
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:50,318
I'd sooner poke my
eyes out with hat pins.

21
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:51,632
Well, that's subtle.

22
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:54,892
Well, I think you would
make a great councilor.

23
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:57,178
Well, the right person
might be able to get

24
00:00:57,203 --> 00:00:58,359
a lot done around here.

25
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:01,820
The right person, John,
wouldn't be caught dead in this,

26
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:04,742
they'd be running
somewhere a little more...

27
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,343
- What?
- Moira...

28
00:01:07,642 --> 00:01:10,023
Okay, maybe I should
say somewhere less...

29
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:10,865
Less what?

30
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:12,500
What's the word I'm
trying to think of?

31
00:01:12,535 --> 00:01:14,827
Well, let's hope we don't find it, okay?

32
00:01:14,852 --> 00:01:17,351
Are we ready to order, councilor?

33
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:20,155
You go ahead.

34
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,664

35
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,256
Have you seen my black shoe?

36
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:31,952
It's a lace up, probably lost in the sea

37
00:01:31,987 --> 00:01:34,227
of your dirty clothes?

38
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:36,421
- No.
- Ugh!

39
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:39,140
What is going on here?!

40
00:01:39,963 --> 00:01:42,497
Why are your clothes
crammed under my bed?

41
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:45,156
It's just temporary storage, David.

42
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,136
Look at your things.

43
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:51,038
Look at your life!

44
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,310
I have been distracted!

45
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:55,750
Why is this wet? Ewww!

46
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:58,201
Because I kicked over a glass of water

47
00:01:58,226 --> 00:01:59,437
that you left on the floor.

48
00:01:59,462 --> 00:02:01,194
I wasn't drinking water.

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,806
Okay, so maybe it was mine,
what difference does it make?

50
00:02:04,186 --> 00:02:06,475
- Ugh!
- Oh my God!

51
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,853
Ugh! Anyway, I need the room tonight,

52
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:09,875
because I'm having a friend over.

53
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,892
What friend?

54
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:15,992
Um Twyla, we're gonna have
a fun little sleepover.

55
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,564
Mhmm... You and Twyla?

56
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,167
Yeah, we're gonna do face masks,

57
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:22,768
and we're gonna talk about
boys that we both know,

58
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:24,636
and have dated.

59
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:27,623
Um, have you spent
more than five minutes

60
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,021
with the girl, one on one?

61
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:30,562
She could be a serial killer.

62
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,283
Twy and I have tea together
like, every day, David.

63
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:38,070
That she serves you... at the cafe.

64
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41,296
Because we're friends.

65
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:44,335
Oh... right.

66
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:48,843
Um, so then where is Twyla
going to sleep tonight?

67
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:51,096
Because I'd say she
could stay under my bed,

68
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:53,297
but your disgusting clothes
are all stuffed under there,

69
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,167
So... just wondering,

70
00:02:56,203 --> 00:02:58,492
where she'd... sleep!

71
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:03,054
- Stop doing that with your face!
- Hmm.

72
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:13,623
Bob, now that Ray's
stepped down from council,

73
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:15,796
I gather his seat is up for grabs?

74
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,289
"His seat is up for grabs?"

75
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,390
I could say something pretty
inappropriate right now.

76
00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:22,525
Well, I'm hoping you don't.

77
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:24,928
No, but I could, that's a real set up.

78
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:27,430
Yeah, yeah, but I was
thinking, if his seat...

79
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:29,466
There you go again!

80
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,569
Could be filled by someone
with real experience...

81
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:35,279
- Uh-huh.
- You see, I played a significant role

82
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:36,750
in Gerald Caine's campaign.

83
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:37,429
Who's that?

84
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,775
Well, he won a seat
in the legislature,

85
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,960
and now he's a senator.

86
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,280
Yeah well, town council
might be small potatoes

87
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:44,681
for a guy like that.

88
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:47,016
Well, not him, Bob. Me!

89
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:49,152
I'm talking about me.

90
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,488
See, I've worked on
a number of campaigns,

91
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:55,037
and I was president of the
Video Retailers Association.

92
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:56,592
Sure, and uh...

93
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:59,028
it might be a nice change of
pace from banging your head

94
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:00,496
against the wall here every day.

95
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,569
Well, I'm not banging
my head against the wall,

96
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:04,427
but if I were to run,

97
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:06,210
I'd need support from people like you.

98
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,578
Boy uh, so if you got this,

99
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:13,635
that would mean we'd work
together here at the garage,

100
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,062
and on council?

101
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:17,492
If I didn't know any better,

102
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:20,695
I might think you had a
crush on me!

103
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,686
Well, that's... That's funny.

104
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:25,148
- I'm only teasing.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

105
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:26,867
I don't mean to embarrass you.

106
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:30,161
- I'm not embarrassed!
- You have no reason to be embarrassed.

107
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,119
- You're a happily married man.
- Oh my.

108
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:34,789
- And so am I!
- Okay, gotta go, Bob.

109
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,875
Hey Twy, come sit!

110
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:48,080
Oh, I'd love to, it's just I
have a lot of tables right now.

111
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:50,972
Okay, well um, maybe
we can hang out after?

112
00:04:51,148 --> 00:04:53,375
I was thinking we could
have a little ladies' night

113
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,656
at my place.

114
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:57,158
- Just the two of us?
- Yeah!

115
00:04:57,591 --> 00:04:59,171
Come by around eight.

116
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:01,791
I'm working tonight,
but maybe this weekend?

117
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,324
Or are you with Mutt on weekends?

118
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:08,079
Um no, because we broke up.

119
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:09,585
I'm sorry to hear that.

120
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:12,745
Although, part of me
is a little relieved.

121
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,996
Since you did tell me
to break up with him,

122
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:16,437
and then you dated him...

123
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:19,148
That's so sweet of you,
but I'm gonna be fine.

124
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:21,295
So how late do you have to work tonight?

125
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:24,127
Um, until people leave, I guess.

126
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:25,852
And when do people leave?

127
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:28,211
I don't know, after people clear out.

128
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:30,179
Okay, well when everybody clears out,

129
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,007
you can just pop by.

130
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:35,773
You know, when I broke up with Mutt,

131
00:05:35,798 --> 00:05:39,117
I just took a lot of
alone time to rebuild,

132
00:05:39,142 --> 00:05:42,039
and regroup, and I just,
I think it's so important.

133
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:44,368
Yeah, and I'm doing the
same kind of thing right now.

134
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:46,132
'Cause it's so important.

135
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:48,937
All right, good.

136
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:52,429
Because you know what they say,
if you can't be by yourself,

137
00:05:52,454 --> 00:05:54,710
then you probably shouldn't
be in a relationship.

138
00:05:54,735 --> 00:05:56,984
Mmhmm, I totally get that.

139
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:01,726
But call me if you happen
to get off work early.

140
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:04,936
Twy? Call me if you get off work early!

141
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:12,452
All right.

142
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:14,132
I know. I know!

143
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:15,632
- Hey, Roland.
- Uh-huh.

144
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:18,539
All right, so one o'clock,
then? All right, terrific.

145
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:20,997
Yeah, no, I look forward to catching up.

146
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:23,914
Great, yep, you too. Okay, all right.

147
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,429
Buh-bye! Sorry, Johnny.

148
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:28,750
I just had to reschedule my colonoscopy.

149
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:32,382
Oh. Well, I just stopped by to pick up

150
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:34,890
a nomination form for town council.

151
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,874
You know, I gotta hand it to you. Um...

152
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:42,203
It takes a brave man to
face defeat yet again,

153
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:44,156
when his ego is so battered and bruised.

154
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:46,410
Well, I don't plan on losing,

155
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:48,492
but thank you for the
vote of confidence.

156
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:50,835
Johnny, nobody plans on losing.

157
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,760
But with all due respect,

158
00:06:52,785 --> 00:06:55,539
this is a kind of a different
playing field for you.

159
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,274
Roland, I ran the second
largest retail video chain

160
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:01,687
in North America, so...

161
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,046
Well, that's good to hear,

162
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:04,648
so you're used to coming in second, huh?

163
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:07,312
Could I get a nomination form, please?!

164
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:09,304
Look I'm just trying to
help you out here, okay?

165
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,968
I've been in politics for 18 years,

166
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:13,359
and let me tell you something, pal,

167
00:07:13,384 --> 00:07:15,406
it ain't a cakewalk, okay?!
Say goodbye to your privacy.

168
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:16,859
You walk into a restaurant,

169
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:18,515
everybody's gonna know who you are!

170
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,414
Well, everyone knows everyone here,

171
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,073
because there's only one restaurant.

172
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:23,597
I mean, just taking your
boy for ice cream cone

173
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:25,234
can turn into a media circus.

174
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,593
Well, your son is 30,
and you never see him.

175
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:29,656
Could I get a form, Roland? Please?

176
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:32,070
You know what?

177
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,375
I'll do you one better,
I'll give you the form,

178
00:07:35,712 --> 00:07:38,296
und your first signature.

179
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:41,687
- Oh, wow.
- There you go, how 'bout that?

180
00:07:41,886 --> 00:07:43,492
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

181
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:45,007
You signed under "Date."

182
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:46,364
Yeah, like that's going
to make a difference.

183
00:07:46,945 --> 00:07:47,945
Okay.

184
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:52,415
Rrrrrr! Come're, you! I'm thirsty!

185
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:57,593
Exciting afternoon?

186
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:00,898
- Thrilling, can't you tell?
- What are you doing tonight?

187
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:03,476
- Uh, I'm busy.
- With what?

188
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:05,701
- I'm going out.
- With who?

189
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:08,227
- Does it matter?
- Where are you going?

190
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:10,182
None of your business!

191
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:12,375
Are you seeing someone?

192
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:16,072
Not exactly.

193
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:18,109
Okay, you're sounding
very sketchy right now.

194
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:19,703
I'm going to a bar to meet someone.

195
00:08:19,728 --> 00:08:22,093
- Who?!
- I don't know yet.

196
00:08:24,226 --> 00:08:26,640
Ohh... So she's going to
a bar to get laid, then.

197
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:28,531
- I see...
- Uh no,

198
00:08:28,556 --> 00:08:31,531
she is going to a bar
to have her needs met

199
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:34,200
by some lovely gentleman
she's yet to meet,

200
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:35,724
who is cute enough to sleep with,

201
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,273
but not nearly mature or
stable enough to marry.

202
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,943
I want that.

203
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,539
Well, you can't come.

204
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,031
'Cause everyone will
think we're together.

205
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,623
Okay, I think you're giving
yourself a lot of credit.

206
00:08:47,342 --> 00:08:49,054
I was being generous.

207
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:50,734
No, We're gonna be each
other's wing people tonight.

208
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,186
Um now, how diverse is the clientele

209
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:56,843
at this local drinkery?

210
00:08:57,055 --> 00:08:58,937
I would say very diverse.

211
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:01,070
I can't remember what life
was like before dating apps.

212
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:03,503
I'm both excited and
terrified for tonight.

213
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:05,421
I don't think I ever
said you could come.

214
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,923
Okay, so what time, though?
And is there a dress code?

215
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,291
'Cause I just want to come prepared.

216
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:12,995
So that I can meet somebody.

217
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:18,501
I'm in Room 7 in case you need me.

218
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:20,202
See you later.

219
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:22,062
This is gonna be so fun for us.

220
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:28,660
You know, it's uh...

221
00:09:29,023 --> 00:09:30,695
It's a funny thing,

222
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:33,955
there seems to be a rumor
going around about me.

223
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,757
I heard that one,

224
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:36,691
it's only because you
converse with women easily,

225
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,626
and you dress so well.

226
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,281
I wouldn't give it another thought.

227
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,404
What?

228
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,116
I'm sorry, which rumor
are you talking about?

229
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,570
The one about me running for council.

230
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:49,403
No, that was about me, John.

231
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:51,639
You were with me when Twyla said that.

232
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,374
If this continues, I'll
have to call a neurologist.

233
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:56,143
No, this is another rumor, Moira.

234
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,882
A rumor about me running for council.

235
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:01,179
From whom did you hear this one?

236
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,083
Well, I-I don't know where it started,

237
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:05,986
but the gist of it is I'd be a shoo-in,

238
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:08,055
and could really get things done.

239
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,607
Well, there's no question about it.

240
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:11,091
You'd be a godsend to council.

241
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:13,226
Well, thank you sweetheart, I agree.

242
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:14,427
But they'll never know about it,

243
00:10:14,462 --> 00:10:16,262
because you have much bigger plans.

244
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:18,665
Yes, I know, well...

245
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,167
I see you go into the office
every day, pistons firing,

246
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,069
you are full of ideas,

247
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:24,744
and you haven't told
me what they are yet,

248
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:27,473
but I have every confidence
that they are brilliant.

249
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:30,445
Yeah, yeah... Well, who
says I can't do both?

250
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:33,826
Moira, being on council
could leverage our position

251
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:36,719
- considerably in this town.
- It's not worth it.

252
00:10:36,744 --> 00:10:39,875
You saw me struggle to get those
modest planters for the motel.

253
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:42,298
Trying to council to
focus on the simplest thing

254
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:44,857
is like... wrangling monkeys!

255
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:46,662
Well, I can wrangle monkeys.

256
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,257
It's called running a business.

257
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:51,263
Yes, you could, but you'd be
wasting your talents on these people.

258
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:53,131
Yeah well, that goes without saying.

259
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,133
Listen, I know it's a giant step down

260
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:56,835
from anything I've
done in the past, but...

261
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,705
Exactly, it's beneath you.

262
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:01,726
Well, I just...

263
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:04,475
worry that the people who
were spreading this rumor

264
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,878
might be a little
disappointed, that's all.

265
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:08,601
Well, you can't worry about them.

266
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,113
- Hey!
- Hey.

267
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,431
Are you waiting for someone?

268
00:11:33,456 --> 00:11:35,953
No, I'm just taking some "me time."

269
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,696
Oh, okay...

270
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,742
I hope I'm not getting
in the way of that.

271
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,309
No, no, you're good.

272
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,367
So, Stevie...

273
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:54,203
you're a strong woman who's alone a lot.

274
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:56,732
Like, I know you dated David,

275
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,241
but everyone's allowed
a mistake, am I right?

276
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,234
You sound like my conscience.

277
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:03,015
Is it hard for you?

278
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:06,213
Uh, is what hard for me?

279
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:08,476
Like, being by yourself here?

280
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,628
Like, you're just totally okay
to sit here all day by yourself?

281
00:12:12,194 --> 00:12:13,360
That's why I took the job.

282
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,955
Mmhm. Okay.

283
00:12:15,991 --> 00:12:17,957
And while you're here, by yourself,

284
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:21,127
you never get this
almost uncontrollable urge

285
00:12:21,162 --> 00:12:24,367
to talk to people, or
be complimented, or...

286
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,632
I know everyone in this town,

287
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:30,336
so for the most part, I
would rather be here by myself

288
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:32,204
than engage in meaningless conversation

289
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,031
with people I don't care about.

290
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,366
Totally.

291
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,062
Mmhm... And why is that?

292
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:43,715
Because I enjoy my own company more.

293
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:46,184
Of course. Of course.

294
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:47,858
Okay.

295
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:52,658
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

296
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:55,694
If I could just-okay.
Thanks, Jazzagals.

297
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:57,829
I just wanted to grab
your ear for just a second,

298
00:12:57,865 --> 00:13:00,298
to make a quick announcement.

299
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:04,235
I will not be at rehearsals for
the next two weeks, because...

300
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:05,764
I have decided to throw
my hat in the ring,

301
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:07,250
and run for council!

302
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:09,851
Oh, Jocelyn!
That's great! Oh my gosh!

303
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:12,377
That's amazing!

304
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:14,111
I'm currently running unopposed.

305
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:17,314
So that kinda takes away
the excitement of winning,

306
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:20,328
you know, but still, I think
it's gonna be a real hoot.

307
00:13:20,353 --> 00:13:21,481
That's so fun! Congratulations!

308
00:13:21,506 --> 00:13:22,545
Good going! Good for you!

309
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,155
Thank you.

310
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:25,889
That's awesome! That's great!

311
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:29,493
So Jocelyn, good for you.
Taking on a new little project.

312
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:31,528
Thanks I'm really looking forward to it.

313
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:33,463
You know what's funny,
just this morning,

314
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:35,965
Twyla asked me if I
was running for council.

315
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,124
That is funny.

316
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,010
I mean, unless you're
thinking of running.

317
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:42,206
Mm, no. No, no.

318
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:45,775
- Can you imagine?
- No!

319
00:13:45,811 --> 00:13:47,777
I mean, just because
you've spent all your time

320
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:50,195
trying to sell the town
and get outta here, so.

321
00:13:50,312 --> 00:13:53,449
Twyla dear, what was it this
morning that made you say

322
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:55,828
I would make such a great councilwoman?

323
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:59,218
Oh, I just heard you were running.

324
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:02,218
- Are you?
- No! I...

325
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:05,461
She's not interested in politics!

326
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:08,234
Although I can see why
someone might think that.

327
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:10,065
I certainly know how to command a crowd,

328
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:13,148
and I've never been one to
shy away from a good fight.

329
00:14:13,273 --> 00:14:16,872
I don't think it's such a bad
idea for someone else to run.

330
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:20,209
A little healthy competition
never hurt anyone.

331
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:23,132
Yeah, a real election race could be fun!

332
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:25,547
Absolutely, I mean,
I wouldn't want anyone

333
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:27,149
to think that I was
just stepping into this,

334
00:14:27,184 --> 00:14:29,500
you know, because of Roland.

335
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:31,820
Yeah, I mean, if any of you townies

336
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:33,321
wanna put your name on the ballot,

337
00:14:33,357 --> 00:14:35,517
I think that's just a great idea.

338
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,436
That's the spirit.

339
00:14:37,594 --> 00:14:39,984
If Jocelyn can do it, anyone can.

340
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:42,516
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Places!

341
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,515
Don't you think?

342
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:48,102
Hmm... On a scale of one

343
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,975
to I'm-gonna-get-beat-up
by-an-angry-local,

344
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,806
where do we see this look fall?

345
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,776
Um, like, easy six.

346
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,211
- Okay.
- Where are you going?

347
00:14:57,247 --> 00:15:00,514
I am going to a sketchy bar
on the outskirts of town.

348
00:15:00,843 --> 00:15:02,316
And nobody invited me?!

349
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:03,920
You know how at home
I am at sketchy bars!

350
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,153
Who are you going with?

351
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:07,388
With Stevie, we're
gonna meet some randoms.

352
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:10,524
So um, when I go missing,

353
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,826
just feel free to tell people
that the last place I was seen

354
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:15,529
was at a sketchy bar on the
outskirts of town meeting randoms.

355
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:17,130
Okay well, this isn't fair, David.

356
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,533
I'm the one who should be at
a sketchy bar meeting randoms.

357
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:21,268
I'm the one who should go missing!

358
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:23,537
- Well then, come!
- I can't.

359
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:25,339
- Why?
- Well, for one thing,

360
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:27,374
this mask doesn't come off
for another twenty minutes.

361
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,143
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

362
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,879
And... second, I told
myself that I would enjoy

363
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:35,070
my own company tonight.

364
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,351
Okay um, well, we're going to a bar,

365
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:40,220
and you're on the rebound, so
text me when you're dressed.

366
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:42,350
I'm serious, David, I'm not coming.

367
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,656
Have fun, though.

368
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,591
Oh, and in case you wake up in a chair

369
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:47,694
with your hands duct taped together,

370
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:49,587
you can snap the duct tape

371
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:51,222
by just raising your
hands over your head,

372
00:15:51,258 --> 00:15:53,351
and then bringing them down really hard.

373
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:57,367
Thanks. Um... see you there?

374
00:15:57,965 --> 00:16:00,132
I'm not coming.

375
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:04,992
I'm not coming.

376
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:14,479
Hi, Moira. How was rehearsal?

377
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:16,981
It was quite an afternoon.
Oh John, thank you.

378
00:16:17,016 --> 00:16:19,216
Listen, I just wanted to thank you

379
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:21,734
- for what you said this morning.
- And what's that?

380
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,218
When we had our little talk
about me running for council.

381
00:16:25,296 --> 00:16:27,624
I have to admit I'd given
it a little more thought

382
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,293
than I'd let on.

383
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:30,928
- Oh?
- Yes.

384
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:33,273
I actually picked up a nomination form.

385
00:16:33,585 --> 00:16:36,333
Really John, I didn't realize.

386
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:38,735
No, no, no, I'm glad
you talked me out of it.

387
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,504
- Okay.
- Yeah, because I thought about the job,

388
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:42,372
what it would entail,
and you know, listen,

389
00:16:42,408 --> 00:16:44,441
Roland drives me crazy
when he's not even around,

390
00:16:44,476 --> 00:16:45,975
- but can you imagine?
- No!

391
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:48,044
Working with him every day?

392
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,647
Huh! I'm laughing about it right now.

393
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:55,117
Did you know Jocelyn is running?

394
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:58,988
No, oh my God! This
gets better and better.

395
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:02,258
So the two of them on council together?

396
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:04,023
Is there a more frightening thought?

397
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:07,007
They would have a virtual
monopoly on this town.

398
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:08,631
Well, don't they already?

399
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:12,178
Exactly, I think someone
needs to challenge them!

400
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:13,531
Right!

401
00:17:14,105 --> 00:17:17,139
So... what are you saying?

402
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:20,142
- That I should run?
- No. Nope.

403
00:17:20,177 --> 00:17:22,139
Because I did get five signatures

404
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:23,846
on my nomination form, and I...

405
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:25,714
No! No, no, no, John, you've
got enough on your plate.

406
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,853
- Oh.
- Whereas I...

407
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:30,413
have nothing but free time.

408
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:37,002
I'm not exactly sure...
where this is going.

409
00:17:37,027 --> 00:17:38,927
John, you have the
family to think about.

410
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:41,429
You're going to accomplish
wonderfully big things.

411
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:44,171
Town council would just, hold you back.

412
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:47,402
But something tells me it will not be...

413
00:17:47,437 --> 00:17:49,170
holding you back?

414
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:51,239
It would be a few weeks of my time.

415
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:53,929
And you know, someone said it
might be a nice project for me.

416
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,611
And would that someone be you?

417
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:58,780
Jocelyn practically
begged me to take the bait!

418
00:17:58,815 --> 00:18:01,343
So you're running for council?!

419
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:05,953
- Looks like it.
- Oh well, isn't that wonderful!

420
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:07,688
Isn't that wonderful!

421
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:09,991
Hey, that's really good news.

422
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:11,525
I'm sorry, John, I
just got swept up in it.

423
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,094
No, no, listen as long as
one of us is running, okay?

424
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:15,596
That's the important thing.

425
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:17,063
It doesn't matter which
one of us is running.

426
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:18,599
I thought it would be me,

427
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:21,635
but then you talked me
out of it! But that's okay!

428
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:23,870
Please John, I'm going to
need you every step of the way.

429
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:25,238
And I'll be right behind you Moira,

430
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:26,907
supporting you, because...

431
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:28,709
you're the one running, and I'm not!

432
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:29,843
How long are we going to be doing this?

433
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:32,445
Oh, just a few more minutes, at least.

434
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:41,625
It's not usually this dead.

435
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:45,468
It's like everybody saw
you coming, and left.

436
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:47,960
Is this really what
our lives have become?

437
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:50,546
Sitting in some sad...

438
00:18:50,984 --> 00:18:53,733
bar waiting to get laid?

439
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:55,468
Well it's this, or the Internet.

440
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:57,343
Oh, I did have a match earlier.

441
00:18:57,984 --> 00:19:01,341
Um who is... 79 miles away.

442
00:19:01,376 --> 00:19:02,542
Well, if you start walking now,

443
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:04,509
you'll get there before breakfast.

444
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:06,484
Alexis is supposed
to be meeting us here.

445
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:08,358
She said she wasn't
coming, but this is a bar,

446
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:11,937
and she is single, so.

447
00:19:12,302 --> 00:19:13,886
Well, you should warn her
that we are the only people

448
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:15,788
here under sixty.

449
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:23,007
Yeah, it's not... not
brimming with options.

450
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:25,507
No.

451
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,889
- Nope.
- No!

452
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:52,790
- No, it didn't feel right.
- No, it didn't.

453
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,851
Well, at least we tried.

454
00:19:55,685 --> 00:19:57,318
I agree.

455
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:05,936
Oh, uh, I notice that
man is no longer sleeping

456
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,937
under the pool table.

457
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,142
Well, I'm surprisingly good at pool.

458
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,278
- So...
- Hmm!

459
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,213
Wait a second, is this
like a reverse hustle,

460
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,715
where you say you're good,
but you're actually terrible?

461
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,593
Um, I don't know.

462
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,453
Do you wanna break?

463
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,455
Um, from what?

464
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,929
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

465
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:11,254
Don't, David.

466
00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:13,578
I have nowhere else to put stuff.

467

468
00:21:18,773 --> 00:21:20,398
It's just a checkpoint.

469
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:21,500
Okay, I've been through

470
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:22,821
tons of these in Johannesburg.

471
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:24,481
It's like a drive-thru,

472
00:21:24,506 --> 00:21:25,974
except everybody has a gun.

473
00:21:26,122 --> 00:21:27,484
When were you in Johannesburg?

474
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,390
I remember I'd just got
my braces off, so...

475
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:31,554
You were 14, in South Africa?

00:00:03,172 --> 00:00:07,009
Johnny: So, this is the town limits?

4
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:10,512
Ray: Yes sir, 4,500 acres that
ends right here at the town sign.

5
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:13,415
And it's all yours, Johnny,
it must be a nice feeling,

6
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:15,616
considering you don't have a lot right now.

7
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:17,285
You know, because of the
crooked business manager.

8
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:18,386
You know, the money scandal...

9
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:20,855
Yes, I know, I know, I know, Ray.

10
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:24,559
What the hell is this?!

11
00:00:24,593 --> 00:00:26,794
Ray: The town sign.

12
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:29,430
Johnny: Is this the real
sign, or the joke sign?

13
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:30,898
Ray: What do you mean?

14
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:33,467
Johnny: You don't see
anything wrong with this?

15
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,603
The man!

16
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:38,272
Standing awfully close to
that woman, wouldn't you say?

17
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:40,575
Johnny: Well, he's holding on to her
so she doesn't fall into the creek.

18
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:42,909
Johnny: Look a little closer, Ray.

19
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:45,312
Ray: Well, it need a little sprucing up.

20
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:47,114
- Johnny: Sprucing up?!
- Ray: It's very popular,

21
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:48,715
people come from all over
to take a picture with it.

22
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,417
Johnny: I'll bet they do!

23
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:53,220
You know what? This is coming down!

24
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:54,854
Ray: That's the mayor's family up there!

25
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,124
The sign's been here over forty years.

26
00:00:57,158 --> 00:01:01,327
Johnny: And you wonder
why this place won't sell?

27
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,864
Oh, I think I see it now.
His shoulders are too big.

(Door creaks open) Moira?

31
00:01:19,234 --> 00:01:21,202
Boy, we've got our work cut out for us.

32
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:23,304
But I've seen worse.

33
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:25,439
It's not a problem.

34
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:27,475
Moira?

35
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,711
<i>Moira: (Slurred) They
dare to call me irrelevant?</i>

36

<i>Shag carpeting, that's irrelevant!</i>

37
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:39,553
<i>L.A. is irrelevant... </i>

38
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:46,326
<i>I am relevant!</i>

39
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:54,201
"Good riddance," is what they said.

40
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:55,669
Oh, who said that, sweetheart?

41
00:01:55,703 --> 00:01:58,672
<i>Moira: I don't know!</i>

42
00:01:58,706 --> 00:02:03,008
They're no name commentors.

43
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:06,412
- Tormentors.
- Are we having a bad day, honey?

44
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:08,771
Moira: Anonymous.

45
00:02:08,806 --> 00:02:12,408
Ominous.

46
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:14,543
That'll be fine, thank you.

47
00:02:14,577 --> 00:02:19,849
I'm afraid I don't have
a gratuity right now.

48
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:22,818
Alexis: So, that guy from the other night.

49
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:25,253
- He's not for me, right?
- David: What guy?

50
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:28,590
That beardy guy that I kissed at the party.

51
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,694
He's gross, right? Like,
that's not a thing for me.

52
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:34,898
There wasn't like, a spark or anything.

53
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:37,665
You mean the hitchhiker that was
burning meat over a garbage can?

54
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,868
Yeah, that one.

55
00:02:39,902 --> 00:02:42,003
Have you seen your mother today?

56
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:43,438
Um yeah, she was face down on the carpet

57
00:02:43,472 --> 00:02:45,440
before dragging herself into the closet.

58
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:47,742
And you didn't say anything?!

59
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:50,578
I thought she was maybe looking
for a contact or something.

60
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:52,180
Johnny: Yeah, she googled herself again,

61
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:55,149
now she's having one of her "things."

62
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:56,684
How bad is it?

63
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,653
Johnny: How bad is it? A solid seven.

64
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:00,888
It's not an eight, which
seems manageable for you.

65
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:02,724
Johnny: Well, except I've got a
few things I have to take care of,

66
00:03:02,758 --> 00:03:04,559
so I need you two to go in, and take...

67
00:03:04,593 --> 00:03:06,761
No, I did Saint-Tropez, so.

68
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:09,230
David: And I did her
birthday, and Aspen twice.

69
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:10,931
Johnny: And I'm trying to sell this town.

70
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:14,034
So, if you kids want any
chance of getting out of here,

71
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,436
you'll help me out, and go
in and look after your mother!

72
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:18,339
Well, my horoscope said
that I shouldn't assume

73
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:20,474
responsibility for
anybody but myself today.

74
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:21,942
Johnny: Yeah, and my horoscope says,

75
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:26,313
why don't you go in and help your mother!

76
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:27,814
And don't let her out of your sight, okay?

77
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:29,182
We don't want her detonating in public!

78
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:31,818
Alexis: I know!

79
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:34,654
Though it is kind of fun to watch, though.

80
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:36,390
Not when you're the one she's
trying to back over with a car.

81
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,392
What's that?

82
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,026
- David: Eye cream.
- Johnny: From where?

83
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,561
David: From Paris.

84
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,496
How did you pay for it?

85
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,431
David: Oh, one of my credit
cards is still working.

86
00:03:45,465 --> 00:03:47,233
Johnny: Oh, you're charging
things to your credit card?!

87
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,136
I see, and how are you gonna pay for it?

88
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,908
David: I don't think you
understand, I already have it.

89
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:57,810
Well, I know this is a
bizarre concept for you, David,

90
00:03:57,844 --> 00:04:01,013
<i>but if you want cream
from Paris, you need a job,</i>

91
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:04,850
so you can pay for the cream from Paris!

92
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:07,586
Okay well, tell that to the
bags under my eyes, then.

93
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:09,254
Johnny: And right after
you tell your next joke,

94
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,656
I want you to go down to the front desk,

95
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,824
and ask what's-her-name...

96
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:13,026
Stevie.

97
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,695
Johnny: Where you can get a
job around here! All right?

98
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,896
I'm in the middle getting
rid of an x-rated sign,

99
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:20,699
before it scares off the few
buyers we might actually have!

100
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:23,668
Okay, I'll get on that.

101
00:04:23,703 --> 00:04:26,839
Johnny: You want the smooth under
eyes of a 16-year-old, get a job!

102
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:30,909
<i>(Door slams)</i>

103
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:33,077
You just need to relax, because
it's not like your boyfriend left you

104
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:35,980
for a Scandinavian flight attendant!

105
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,850
What kind of name is Kika anyway?

106
00:04:38,884 --> 00:04:40,485
I'm the one that should be in
the closet right now, not you.

107
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,620
Moira: Help me out.

108
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:44,456
- Moira: Help me!
- Alexis: Okay!

109
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,892
- Moira: Oh, shhh!
- My foot's fallen asleep.

110
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:51,128
Hey, shall we see what they're
saying about you and Stavros?

111
00:04:51,163 --> 00:04:54,598
Alexis: No! Moira: It's not my idea!

112
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:56,667
Moira: You were a couple of doe eyed lovers

113
00:04:56,701 --> 00:05:01,339
aboard a trans-Atlantic
airship filled with gas!

114
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:02,473
Alexis: You know what I think we should do?

115
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:04,275
I think we should go get something to eat,

116
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:07,043
because when you're eating you
can't be talking to me, okay?

117
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:08,846
- Moira: You know what I think?
- Alexis: What?

118
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,248
(Snorts like a pig)

119
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:14,818
You date pigs.

120
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:17,755
Okay, I just remembered that being
a mother is not your strong suit.

121
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:22,292
Oh darling, I'm only telling
you because it's true!

122
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:23,559
Alexis: And because you
gobbled down a hundred thousand

123
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:25,561
anti-depressants this morning.

124
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:29,599
Moira: I was hungry! But I could still eat.

125
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:30,500
(Stapler clicks)

126
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,774
David: Hi, um... question.

127
00:05:37,808 --> 00:05:42,845
If one were to theoretically look for a job

128
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,749
here in Schitt's Creek, where would you...

129
00:05:46,784 --> 00:05:49,819
suggest that that person go to look?

130
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:52,187
Is there, like, a bulletin
board or a pamphlet,

131
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:53,689
or something with information on it?

132
00:05:53,724 --> 00:05:55,958
Stevie: No, no bulletin board...

133
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:58,294
What kind of job are you looking for?

134
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:01,530
David: Um, something in like, art
curating, or trend forecasting.

135
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:04,733
Stevie: Oh, okay... um, hmmm, let's see.

136
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:07,569
Not seeing anything in art curating,

137
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:09,838
or trend forecasting, that's weird.

138
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:11,673
David: Okay.

139
00:06:11,757 --> 00:06:14,158
Um, do you have any other
skills or areas of expertise?

140
00:06:14,193 --> 00:06:16,260
I've been told I have really good taste.

141
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:17,856
Oh, well, that's good.

142
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,026
Um, let's see... Oh!

143
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,762
Bag boy at the grocery store.

144
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:25,096
I don't know what that is.

145
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,465
You put groceries in bags,

146
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:28,832
so that people can carry their groceries

147
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:31,969
out of the grocery store.

148
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:35,206
Okay, and how much do
you think that would pay?

149
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,809
Mmm, I'm gonna say minimum wage.

150
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:41,212
Johnny: Which is what, forty,
forty-five something an hour?

151
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:44,915
- Mmm-hmm, exactly.
- David: Okay. Okay!

152
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,283
Um, well, something to think about.

153
00:06:46,317 --> 00:06:48,318
For sure, thank you.

154
00:06:48,352 --> 00:06:51,655
Stevie: You're welcome.

155
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,993
Moira: I would like two apple fritters,

156
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:59,229
sliver of pecan pie, large
fries with gravy and bacon!

No, I use it to compost.

My class is putting on a play for
the younger grades, and I just...

220

thought that you'd be perfect,

221
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,454

222

1
00:00:01,873 --> 00:00:04,659
Just the "little farmer's
breakfast" for me, Twyla.

2
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:07,109
I've got the tasting for
the wedding this afternoon,

3
00:00:07,194 --> 00:00:09,549
don't wanna 
spoil my appetite.

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,667
Oh! You're not using
the café for catering?

5
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:15,505
Yes, John. Why wouldn't
you have Twyla

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,340
cater David's big day?

7
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:20,912
Well, the food for the wedding 
is my gift to David,

8
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:23,508
so it's really his decision.

9
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:26,849
It's just the more you keep
mentioning that it's a gift,

10
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:29,117
the less and less
it feels like a gift.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,301
You know, I-I was just
thinking that, you know,

12
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:34,522
how can Twyla enjoy herself
at the wedding

13
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:36,591
if she's-if she's working?

14
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:38,423
I'm invited to the wedding?

15
00:00:38,508 --> 00:00:39,960
Sure looks like it.

16
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:43,725
Look at you, John, doling out
gift after gift this morning

17
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,033
like the Turkish
Saint Nikolaas.

18
00:00:46,118 --> 00:00:47,777
I'll just have the fruit cup
to go, please.

19
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:50,700
I... must attend to some good news
of my own.

20
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:52,418
Coming right up.

21
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,993
David, I didn't know 
she wasn't invited to the wedding.

22
00:00:57,078 --> 00:00:59,954
Well, you certainly fixed
that problem for yourself.

23
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:01,426
What's your good news?

24
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:02,583
Thank you.

25
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,019
Tippy Bernstein
is on his way here.

26
00:01:05,103 --> 00:01:08,180
He solicited a power-lunch
with me today.

27
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:10,834
Well, there is a name
I haven't heard in a while.

28
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:13,098
Tippy Bernstein was
the executive producer

29
00:01:13,183 --> 00:01:16,236
on "Sunrise Bay."
What could he possibly want?

30
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,965
I'm assuming a new project.

31
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:19,967
Tippy always had his fingers
in a few fires.

32
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:21,636
Oh dear.

33
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:24,988
- Good God.
- Brave faces everyone.

34
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:27,570
- Hey.
- Alexis!

35
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:31,861
Oh, you're looking so natural
and peppy.

36
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:33,850
A bit of a rough night
actually.

37
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:34,714
Oh.

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,817
Well, you're fooling
everyone, dear.

39
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:39,592
Mhmm.
Um... you just have,

40
00:01:39,677 --> 00:01:40,896
you have something
in your hair.

41
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,747
Here. I'm just gonna grab...
that.

42
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,863
- Is it gone?
- Yeah.

43
00:01:45,094 --> 00:01:46,244
Yeah.

Well, thanks for turning up
so early, everyone.

48
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:56,209
And welcome.
My name is Johnny...

49
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:57,437
Johnny Rose.

50
00:01:57,532 --> 00:01:59,542
It's printed right here
on the cover of the book

51
00:01:59,627 --> 00:02:01,171
that he's handing out
to all of you.

00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:03,109
And my name is Roland Schitt...

53
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:04,961
And I'm the boss
you're gonna come to

54
00:02:05,096 --> 00:02:06,814
when you don't understand
why this guy

55
00:02:06,898 --> 00:02:09,065
is making you read
about VHS tapes.

56
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:12,414
Not exactly the united front
we had discussed, Roland.

57
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,288
Well, Johnny, somebody has
to inspire these people.

58
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:19,300
Well, welcome to the Rosebud
Motel family.

59
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,663
Oh, there is our other partner,
Stevie Budd!

60
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:24,065
Stevie, do you wanna come over
and say hi to our new staff?

61
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:26,786
Uh, I think I need to speak
to you for a minute in private.

62
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:29,644
Well, no need for that,
we're all family here.

63
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:33,840
Okay. Ronnie found termite
damage in Room Six

64
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:36,424
and apparently the entire
foundation

65
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:38,629
is about to collapse.
Uh, Stevie,

66
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:40,648
that's really something
we should talk about in private.

67
00:02:40,732 --> 00:02:42,166
- Mhmm.
- Tell you what?

68
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:44,932
Why don't we take five,
and feel free to help yourself

69
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:47,370
to one of our vending machine
over there.

70
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:49,839
Here you go.

71
00:02:49,926 --> 00:02:51,511
Welcome everyone.

72
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:54,146
How are we gonna cover
these costs?

73
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:57,231
Well, I gave one of my
kidneys to my cousin Bruce.

74
00:02:57,316 --> 00:03:00,450
Uh, we can see how I run
on an empty tank.

75
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:04,080
I went to school with a guy
who starts "accidental" fires.

76
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:05,097
I mean, worse comes to worst,

77
00:03:05,182 --> 00:03:06,823
we could collect
the insurance money.

78
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:08,399
Okay. We're not burning
anything down

79
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:10,402
and we're not selling any
organs.

80
00:03:10,552 --> 00:03:12,285
We're knee-deep in this now.

81
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,898
We're just have
to figure out where

82
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:16,225
- we're gonna find the money.
- Okay. That's good,

83
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,840
because Bruce told me
my kidney was garbage.

84
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:23,464
<i>Take the pills, Vivian.</i>

85
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:26,160
<i>A "please" might be nice!</i>

86
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:28,255
<i>You really think you'd be
head of surgery</i>

87
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:29,344
<i>at Sunrise General</i>

88
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:31,280
<i>if you weren't possessed
by your father?</i>

89
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,300
<i>Who also happened to be
the former</i>

90
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:35,262
<i>head of surgery at Sunrise
General?</i>

91
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:37,681
Oh, enjoying the box set,
are we?

92
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,172
This season is weird.

93
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:41,316
You're great in it,

94
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:43,399
but I forgot how bad
Clifton Sparks was.

95
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:45,132
Oh, it's Uncle Sparky to you,
Dear.

96
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:46,844
Also, I'm so confused.

97
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:49,048
Why is Vivian the only one
who gets possessed

98
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,717
when Trystan also played
the Ouija game?

99
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:53,077
Oh, suddenly she's
the director.

100
00:03:55,063 --> 00:03:56,748
And where do we think
we're going?

101
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,751
Well, I feel like your
publicist should be there

102
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:00,550
if you're meeting
with Tickle Bernstein.

103
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:02,729
Tippy.
It's Tippy, and no,

104
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:05,128
not necessary, dear.
Not in your condition.

105
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:06,176
- Thank you.
- No it's fine.

106
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,041
I'll just...
throw on some clothes.

107
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:09,803
No! I insist.

108
00:04:09,888 --> 00:04:12,485
Mummy can handle this one
all by herself.

109
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,916
All right? What's important is
that you stay here

110
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:16,346
where no one can see you

111
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:18,612
and focus on your critical
self-care.

112
00:04:20,397 --> 00:04:22,430
Oh, I wanna see this.

113
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,267
<i>You can and you know it!</i>

114
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,202
How dare you make me
kill my father twice!

115
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,979
<i>You'll pay for this one day.</i>

116

<i>I think that's a must.</i>

118
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:47,297
I honestly don't know
what to pick.

119
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:50,444
Mr. Rose,
this looks pretty fancy.

120
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,728
You sure you're okay
to pay for it?

121
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:54,749
I know you have the motel
to worry about.

122
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,817
Well, I can't back out now,
Stevie.

123
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,652
David would understand.

124
00:04:58,812 --> 00:04:59,993
I mean, not at first,

125
00:05:00,078 --> 00:05:03,036
but deep down he's not
a total monster.

126
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:04,307
So we're two minutes late

127
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:05,747
and if this were the actual
wedding,

128
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:07,617
the doors would be closed
and you would be locked out.

129
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:10,435
Okay? Um, this is Penelope,
she's our caterer.

130
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,899
Penelope, this is my Dad,

131
00:05:11,983 --> 00:05:13,484
who's footing the bill
for the food.

132
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:16,002
Stevie is my Maid of Honour,
she's just here to eat.

133
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:19,906
So Penelope and I have already
selected an appetizer.

134
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:22,019
Wow. This is quite
the spread.

135
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:23,811
Looks very impressive, son.

136
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:26,848
- Expensive but impressive!
- Hm.

137
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:30,481
Oh, I like this,
little side salad.

138
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:31,752
Poor thing.

139
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,555
That's the garnish
for the lobster roll.

140
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:36,823
Lobster! Ah.

141
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:38,526
Are we inviting
The Vanderbilts?

142
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,842
I said lobster roll.

143
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:42,363
And to your point, we have
not discussed the salad.

144
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:44,933
Oh, I have an amazing
parmesan, arugula

145
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:45,940
and black truffle salad

146
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:47,371
that would complement
the evening perfectly.

147
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:50,229
- My God! Yes!
- Or... or...

148
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:53,577
if we're not using the lettuce
under the lobster roll

149
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:57,336
can we just not make a side
salad out of this lettuce?

150
00:05:57,421 --> 00:05:59,790
- Are these prices per table?
- Um, per plate.

151
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,897
And speaking of, we are adding
eight more plates.

152
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:03,834
I was finally allowed to invite
some friends from New York,

153
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:06,169
- they're a caviar crowd.
- Oh, I love that idea.

154
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:07,408
- I love that.
- Caviar?

155
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:08,217
Huh?

156
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,918
Would anyone like to try
some beef tenderloin?

157
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,354
Oh, sure. Sure.

158
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:14,502
Oh, you know what they say
about tenderloin;

159
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:16,344
always... a risky option.

160
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:18,655
It's gotta be done just,
just right.

161
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,113
Hmmm...

162
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,767
- Mmm.
- Yes.

163
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,411
- Mmm.
- Yes.

164
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:29,945
Well, you know, it's-it's...
it's fine.

165
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,043
It's fine?

166
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:32,918
Oh, it's the best thing
I've ever tasted.

167
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:34,928
Well, you don't want people
coming to your wedding

168
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:36,796
and only talking about
the food.

169
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:38,633
That is literally
the only thing

170
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:40,363
I want them talking about.
What is wrong with you?

171
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:42,533
- You love beef tenderloin.
- No, I'm just exploring,

172
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:44,240
- you know, other options.
- Okay.

173
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:47,798
Well, might I suggest you
explore the duck confit

174
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:51,735
Why not, it's not like we're
paying for the samples.

175
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:54,789
We're not paying for
the samples, are we?

176
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:56,331
- No.
- Oh.

177
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:59,302
Okay. Then do you wanna put
a bit more tenderloin

178
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,344
- on there, please.
- Of course.

179
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:09,050
Moira Fucking Rose.

180
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:10,241
Wow.

181
00:07:10,326 --> 00:07:11,948
I mean, I figured time stood
still in this town,

182
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:12,889
but look at you!

183
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,473
You are just as gorgeous

184
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:16,855
as the day
I discovered you.

185
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,243
Oh Tippy.

186
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,151
You're as alive as ever!

187
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:22,319
No, don't get up!

188
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:23,599
No, no. Don't worry about it.

189
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:25,886
Cured that vertigo years ago.
I hired a hynotherapist.

190
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:27,293
Then I married her.

191
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:28,850
And then I divorced her.

192
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:31,344
You-are-getting-very... broke.

193
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:32,800
Ha!

194
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,788
Tippy, I have missed
that vaudevillian charm.

195
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,761
Oh, Honey,
it's been far too long,

196
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:38,868
but I come bearing gifts.

197
00:07:38,953 --> 00:07:41,299
And the first one's standing
right over there.

198
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:44,255
Clifton!

199
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:45,998
Muffy!

200
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,737
Looking luscious as always.

201
00:07:48,822 --> 00:07:51,501
Oh, had I known you were both
coming,

202
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,870
I'd have dressed
for the occasion.

203
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:57,617
You're looking fresh
and dewy.

204
00:07:57,784 --> 00:07:58,920
Gave up the drink.

205
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:01,026
Strictly a wine
and scotch man now.

206
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:02,930
Listen, what do you say
we all take a load off

207
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:06,143
because this standing thing is
not all it's cracked up to be.

208
00:08:07,193 --> 00:08:10,913
Cliffy! Cliffy,
I have not seen you

209
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:13,661
since you starred in that
electrifying courtroom drama

210
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:16,133
about the potty mouth,
feral child.

211
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:17,631
Oh, that was an actual
court case.

212
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:19,667
My daughter wanted
to emancipate

213
00:08:19,752 --> 00:08:21,604
and the press couldn't get
enough.

214
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:23,955
- Lucky you!
- Speaking of...

215
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:27,209
the press can't get
enough of you, Moira.

216
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:29,095
That "Crow" picture.

217
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,455
I mean,
who'd have thought?

218
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:32,266
Oh. Thank you!

219
00:08:33,156 --> 00:08:35,174
And what did you think,
Clifton?

220
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,769
I can't wait for the screener.

221
00:08:38,002 --> 00:08:40,594
So, I'm sure you're dying to
know what this is all about,

222
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,508
and since this isn't sweeps
weeks,

223
00:08:42,593 --> 00:08:43,612
I won't keep you hanging.

224
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,481
My imagination has become

225
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,887
- rather unbridled since you called.
- Hmm.

226
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,415
Let me guess.
A reunion?

227
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,740
No, it's much, much, much,
much better.

228
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,562
Some sort of televised event?
It's a panel?

229
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:56,672
Late night?

230
00:08:56,757 --> 00:08:59,336
They wanna reboot
"Sunrise Bay!"

231
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:00,720
What? Who...

232
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:02,988
No, no. It's a big, big
co-production.

233
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:05,095
All the good people want in.
Moira, it's gonna be raw,

234
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,365
it's gonna be edgy,
and primetime!

235
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:08,750
A sexy new cast,

236
00:09:08,835 --> 00:09:10,466
but they have asked
for prominent characters

237
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,324
from the original to ground
the whole thing.

238
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:14,826
- So I called Clifton...
- Alphabetical.

239
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:16,131
- And he said...
- I said,

240
00:09:16,216 --> 00:09:18,549
I wouldn't do it without you.

241
00:09:18,977 --> 00:09:21,730
And that was before
Nicole Kidman signed on

242
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:23,328
as Adriana's daughter.

243
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:25,217
Nicole Kidman.

244
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,954
And I was believing you both
up till now.

245
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,224
No, no, no.
M-Moira this is all true.

246
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:34,080
Have you forgotten that
Vivian was killed off?

247
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:35,436
When has that ever stop us?

248
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:37,056
But that last time
I was shredded.

249
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,799
That's why we have writers.
Let them do their magic.

250
00:09:39,884 --> 00:09:42,025
Oops, oops.
What do we have here?

251
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,045
What is that? Is this maybe
a very generous offer

252
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,856
for a direct to-series
primetime Emmy contender.

253
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,794
Have a read.
Have a read of that

254
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,771
and then maybe meet up
with us later tonight?

255
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:54,480
We can celebrate
over drinks.

256
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:56,798
I don't know what to say.

257
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:59,781
It's a simple answer,
Vivian.

258
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:02,361
Say yes.

259
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:13,278
Alexis!
Do I have news...

260
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,573
Okay,
thank God you're here

261
00:10:14,658 --> 00:10:15,979
because I have so many
questions.

262
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:18,264
Like, why did they kill off
your character

263
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:20,705
after you had just given birth
to your ninth child

264
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:23,178
and escaped from the cave with
the secret about your lover...

265
00:10:23,262 --> 00:10:24,449
Who was a ghost, yes.

266
00:10:24,587 --> 00:10:27,260
...and then they killed off in
like the most humiliating way.

267
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:29,234
I'm not sure I call it
humiliating.

268
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:31,338
You vomited a demon
into a toilet,

269
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,834
and then fell in and drowned.

270
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,638
Well, the writers insisted
it was symbolic.

271
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:36,248
- Nevertheless, I have something...
- And then they

272
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:37,747
- shredded you.
- Yes.

273
00:10:37,832 --> 00:10:39,304
Yes. I should have seen
that coming

274
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,884
after the contract demands but...

275
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:42,935
Okay yes.
Re: that drama.

276
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,272
I just fell down a dark
Sunrise fan-hole

277
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:47,323
and found this message board
about conspiracy

278
00:10:47,408 --> 00:10:49,389
- theories. There are a lot of fans
- Oh Alexis.

279
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:52,154
Who think Clifton Sparks
had you written off the show

280
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,693
because he was jealous.

281
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,473
Don't be a dotty,
poor Alexis.

282
00:10:55,558 --> 00:10:59,981
No I, unwittingly negotiated
myself off the show.

283
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:01,488
End of story.

284
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:03,259
Okay.
You watch this video

285
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:05,603
and tell me who you think
he's referring to then.

286
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:08,487
Come.

287
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,269
<i>There has been some
serious Sunrise intrigue</i>

288
00:11:12,354 --> 00:11:14,339
<i>around the sudden departure
of Vivian Blake.</i>

289
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:15,842
<i>Can you tell us what happened?</i>

290
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,371
<i>She had a good run.</i>

291
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:21,862
<i>But let's just say "someone"
reminded the producers</i>

292
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,905
<i>that there's only room
for one head of surgery</i>

293
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,333
<i>at Sunrise General.</i>

294
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:29,758
<i>And I think all
you housewives at home</i>

295
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:31,345
<i>know who that should be.</i>

296
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:33,206
See, he's basically admitting

297
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,579
to having you written off
the show.

298
00:11:34,663 --> 00:11:37,026
No. He's drunk there.
No. That's not...

299
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:39,806
No, Alexis I came here
to tell you something...

300
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:43,105
I've been asked
to resuscitate Vivian

301
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,226
so that she may live again
in a primetime reboot.

302
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:49,086
Is Clifton involved?

303
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,541
Alexis, he drove all this way

304
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:54,249
just to personally beg me
to acquiesce.

305
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:55,513
Hm. Of course he did.

306
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:57,653
You're the only person
in the show making headlines

307
00:11:57,738 --> 00:11:59,871
- right now.
- That's not true.

308
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:02,925
Adriana had that DUI last year.

309
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,658
Popped a breasts, poor dear

310
00:12:04,743 --> 00:12:06,781
They need you.
And all I'm saying is,

311
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:08,731
as your publicist
and your daughter,

312
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:11,285
and now the moderator of
the "Sunrise Bay" fan forum,

313
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,111
there's more to this story.

314
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:14,504
And if you wanna go through
with this

315
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:16,010
after watching that video?

316
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:18,040
Just remember that there
is nothing wrong

317
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,102
with asking for what you
deserve.

318
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,950
Perhaps a little more housework
and little less mouse work

319
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,714
might do you some good, Alexis.

320
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:28,467
But thank you for your pair
of pennies.

321
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:33,577
Hmm.

322
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:38,012
Good news, Stevie, I think
I may have found someone

323
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:40,624
who can do the fumigation
for half the price.

324
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,114
His name's Phil.

325
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:44,016
He's got a lot
of two-star reviews,

326
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:47,254
but that's one more star
than the other guys.

327
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:49,730
Will the savings cover
the cost

328
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:51,667
of rebuilding the foundation?

329
00:12:52,494 --> 00:12:54,844
No. No they won't.

330
00:12:54,928 --> 00:12:57,122
So I guess the news isn't
that good after all.

331
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,892
Ooh, hi.

332
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:01,885
Hi. Oh, still eating
the tenderloin?

333
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:03,834
Well, they were just gonna
throw it out, David.

334
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:05,372
Oh.

335
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:08,250
Um, I noticed that there
was some awkwardness

336
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:10,927
earlier at the tasting,
and I just got the sense

337
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:13,078
that you were uncomfortable
about something.

338
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:14,517
Oh?

339
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:16,306
I don't know why you would
think that.

340
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:17,770
Penelope asked
if you wanted to crack

341
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:19,402
the top of the creme brulée
and you asked,

342
00:13:19,486 --> 00:13:21,055
"If we break it, do we buy it?"

343
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,819
Well, I think that was a
perfectly legitimate question

344
00:13:23,978 --> 00:13:27,294
considering I wasn't even
hungry after the beef.

345
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:29,411
Okay. I know
what's going on.

346
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:31,329
- You do?
- Yeah, and don't worry,

347
00:13:31,414 --> 00:13:33,362
you don't have to cover
the cost of the extra table.

348
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,801
That's eight plates than you
hadn't budgeted for.

349
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,774
Plus Patrick's parents ended up
giving us way more money

350
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,997
- than we had expected.
- Oh.

351
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:43,113
Yeah. Apparently there is
some nest egg they set aside

352
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,528
for Patrick and his ex-fiancée.

353
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:46,567
So honestly you have to pay
for anything

354
00:13:46,652 --> 00:13:48,203
if it's going to be a strain.

355
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,134
David,

356
00:13:50,584 --> 00:13:53,051
I said I would cover the food...
Okay.

357
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,372
But if the Brewers wanna pay
for the extra table,

358
00:13:57,457 --> 00:14:01,686
then I think that's a wonderful
gesture form the Brewers.

359
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:04,126
Great. What did I tell you
about that beef?

360
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,241
- Oh good.
- Right?

361
00:14:06,898 --> 00:14:08,967
- So good, right?
- Hmm.

362
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:19,166
Mr. Rose,

363
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:23,875
It's not gonna always be
like this.

364
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:28,369
You know, we had a sizable
nest egg set aside

365
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:30,172
for David's wedding.

366
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:34,193
He was talking about Bali
for a while.

367
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:39,547
We were gonna charter
some jets.

368
00:14:41,238 --> 00:14:42,757
Fly everybody.

369
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,931
I'm gonna get some air, Stevie.

370
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,633
Please. You know,
I'm not interested in that.

371
00:15:13,718 --> 00:15:14,894
Room for one more?

372
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:17,637
Muffy, grab a chair.
I hope you don't mind,

373
00:15:17,722 --> 00:15:20,010
we decided to get a head start
on the celebration.

374
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:21,729
Extra dry?
Extra olive?

375
00:15:21,814 --> 00:15:24,071
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Bernstein!

376
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,788
Hey, tell that cute bartender
I'd love a sex on the beach.

377
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:30,024
If she has time,
I need another scotch.

378
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:32,709
Ha! You better hurry
if you want to catch up.

379
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:35,115
Oh no, this doctor would
rather nurse her potable,

380
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,338
if you don't mind.

381
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:38,957
Best to stay lucid
for our congress.

382
00:15:39,082 --> 00:15:41,168
Hey. Remember how you entered
that time machine

383
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:43,694
you discovered in the
hospital's broom closet?

384
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:44,845
Season Three?

385
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,837
What if we bring you back
that way?

386
00:15:48,902 --> 00:15:52,197
It's not easy to disremember
my final demise.

387
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:55,106
It was even more vicious
than Vivian's getting trampled

388
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:57,440
while honeymooning
in Pamplona.

389
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:59,343
Oh Moira! Get over it!

390
00:15:59,428 --> 00:16:03,469
Contract negotiations
go sour all the time!

391
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:06,018
What do you know about
my contract?

392
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:07,307
What?

393
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:09,715
I believe I gave you a new
contract today.

394
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,482
Did you-did you bring it?

395
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:16,534
- Clifton...
- Hm?

396
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,757
There are fans
who think that

397
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:21,078
you might have had something
to do with

398
00:16:21,162 --> 00:16:23,319
my being written off the show.

399
00:16:23,404 --> 00:16:25,723
What?! Who?
Why would...?

400
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,518
Look, Moira, there were
a lot of egos back then,

401
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:29,938
and I was different man.

402
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,923
That was before my liver
transplant.

403
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:33,457
Is it true?

404
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,451
Think of it
as a compliment.

405
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:38,661
Your star was rising,
and I was maybe jealous.

406
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:40,725
Oh, would you look at this.

407
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:42,498
I'm getting texts
from Nicole's office.

408
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,902
Serves me right for sharing
EP credit. These people...

409
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:47,071
I'm guessing, Clifton
was also responsible

410
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:49,611
for my name being
repeatedly left off

411
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:51,286
the Daytime Emmy ballot?

412
00:16:51,371 --> 00:16:53,104
No, we submitted you
every year.

413
00:16:53,582 --> 00:16:55,729
And-and that season that
you played your own brother

414
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,470
we submitted you for
Best Actress and Actor.

415
00:16:57,554 --> 00:16:58,619
You did what?

416
00:16:58,704 --> 00:17:00,312
Oh, Tippy,
I did not negotiate myself

417
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:03,179
out of the job, did I?

418
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:06,629
You deserved every penny.

419
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:08,348
Please Moira,

420
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:11,566
I want you to consider
this offer as my amends.

421
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:14,410
If you sign on them, we all get
back to doing what we love.

422
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:16,739
There is something I love

423
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:19,530
that I haven't been able
to do for quite some time.

424
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:27,303
Now, Mr. Bernstein,
I have a few demands.

425
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:32,491
Hm. Hm. Mmm.

426
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:34,018
I don't know, Johnny,

427
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:37,267
I have been racking my brain
to come up with the cash.

428
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,861
I mean at this point,

429
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:42,060
I'm willing to sell my baseball
signed by Geena Davis.

430
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,178
Might take more than that,
Roland.

431
00:17:44,742 --> 00:17:46,658
Gentlemen. Hello.

432
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:48,478
- Stevie.
- Hello.

433
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:51,298
Well, apologies for calling
such a late meeting

434
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,560
but I think you'll both agree
we're in a bit of a situation.

435
00:17:55,695 --> 00:17:57,018
And by "situation"

436
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:59,370
he means that money-pit
of a motel we bought.

437
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:02,136
No, I stand by the decision
to expand our business

438
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:04,519
but at this point,
I think our only option

439
00:18:04,837 --> 00:18:06,642
is to sell the second motel,

440
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:08,691
and recoup whatever we can.

441
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:10,512
Yeah, and I'm in total
agreement.

442
00:18:10,597 --> 00:18:12,628
Well, I don't like that idea.

443
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:14,433
I don't like that idea
at all.

444
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:16,136
What else you got,
Johnny?

445
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:19,458
What if we bought
30 more motels?

446
00:18:19,543 --> 00:18:21,143
Right now.

447
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:24,858
What am I looking at?

448
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:28,210
These are all the roadside
motels currently for sale.

449
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:31,381
Now bottom line,
we're not gonna make money

450
00:18:31,465 --> 00:18:32,795
off of two or three locations.

451
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:35,318
We're only gonna start seeing
the real money

452
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:37,331
at 20 or 30 locations.

453
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,957
Yeah, I'm with Stevie,
it's a lost cause.

454
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:42,242
Now this would be
a bigger undertaking.

455
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:45,658
And if we franchised
on a larger scale,

456
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:47,786
yeah, the dividends
would be greater.

457
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:49,637
Stevie, where did you
come up with this?

458
00:18:49,782 --> 00:18:51,834
Oh, it was in a book
I was given.

459
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,932
I don't know,
maybe you read it.

460
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:57,480
You did this before,
Mr. Rose.

461
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:00,031
I think you can do it again.

462
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:04,708
Well, we would need a proper
investor to pull this off.

463
00:19:05,072 --> 00:19:06,592
You know, for the first time,

464
00:19:06,693 --> 00:19:10,079
I think I can actually call in
some favours with this idea.

465
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:12,555
I mean, we'd need a really
strong pitch.

466
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:15,389
And boy, I-I don't even know
if anyone from the old life

467
00:19:15,474 --> 00:19:16,921
would even take a meeting but...

468
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:18,706
A wise man once wrote:

469
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,577
"You miss 100% of the tapes
you don't play".

470
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:23,435
I did write that.

471
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,660
And I know that
a wise man once wrote:

472
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:29,664
"Thank you to my wife, Moira."

473
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:31,881
That's just the dedication,
Roland.

474
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:33,740
That's as far as I got,
Johnny.

475
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:36,996
I'm sorry, I'm partial
to historical fiction.

476
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:47,657
Oh Alexis, has our quarantine
been lifted?

477
00:19:47,741 --> 00:19:49,544
Yeah, I was scared
I was gonna get bed sores,

478
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:51,189
so I'm going for a run.

479
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,930
Also, I needed to like cleanse
my brain a bit.

480
00:19:54,014 --> 00:19:55,811
'Cause eight hours of watching
"Sunrise Bay"

481
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:58,134
made me feel a little
not-right in the head.

482
00:19:58,219 --> 00:19:59,468
It had that effect.

483
00:19:59,553 --> 00:20:00,975
The New England Journal
of Medicine

484
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,112
did a fascinating study on it.

485
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,799
Will you be trapped in this
crystal the entire episode?

486
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:07,357
Best to skip ahead.

487
00:20:07,444 --> 00:20:08,752
So how was the meeting?

488
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:11,247
You Alexis are one shrewd
little Reynard.

489
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:13,258
You were right about Clifton.

490
00:20:13,414 --> 00:20:15,132
He sucks in this, by the way.

491
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:16,826
So he had you written off
the show?

492
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:19,581
Yes, but I used
that little nugget

493
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,087
- to negotiate a superior deal.
- Hm?

494
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:23,277
I am after all,

495
00:20:23,362 --> 00:20:25,700
the one in the cast member
still making headlines.

496
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:28,691
So you still said yes?

497
00:20:28,776 --> 00:20:30,077
I did.

498
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,286
But on the condition

499
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:34,603
that Clifton be written off
the show - death of my choosing.

500
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:36,274
And I asked for
more money.

501
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,593
Okay. Yass, Mom.

502
00:20:37,678 --> 00:20:39,228
And a diamond tennis bracelet.

503
00:20:39,313 --> 00:20:41,215
Okay. Well, that seems like
a bit much.

504
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,027
But it still sounds like you
got what you're worth?

505
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:44,629
Oh, God no.

506
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:47,370
I made them an offer
they had to refuse.

507
00:20:47,634 --> 00:20:48,986
So, you're not doing it then?

508
00:20:49,071 --> 00:20:50,671
No.
Thank you, Alexis.

509
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:53,125
Thank you for removing
my rosy lunettes,

510
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,440
so that I might see Clifton
for who he really is.

511
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:59,162
If you did all that
without getting out of bed,

512
00:20:59,246 --> 00:21:01,577
imagine what you're capable
of doing.

513
00:21:01,831 --> 00:21:03,636
Okay, how is it
that your daughter

514
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,464
is also trapped in the cave
but has never looked up once.

515
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:08,816
You've been hanging over her
for three straight episodes.

516
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,201
Oh, you know, children, this
is where the season picks up.

517
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:14,052
When the cave starts talking
back to me.

518
00:21:14,136 --> 00:21:16,203
Voiced by the wonderful
Peter Falk.

519
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:17,812
I was gonna go
for a run.

520
00:21:17,897 --> 00:21:19,810
Shh.
She's about to look up.

521

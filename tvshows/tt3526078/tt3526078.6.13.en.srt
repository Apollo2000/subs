1
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:05,155
Oh, bev I'm sorry
I missed you,

2
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,369
But I'm so happy
I got your voicemail!

3
00:00:07,454 --> 00:00:09,214
Wondering when you might
be getatable

4
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:12,452
For a little red biddy,
little back chat? Hm?

5
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,774
Oh, and we're moving
to New York.

6
00:00:14,894 --> 00:00:18,699
I just thought it was time.
Ciao.

7
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,244
Don't tell me you're having
lunch with Bev

8
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:25,260
- After all this.
- Imagine?

9
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:27,776
No, I amputated those people
years ago.

10
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,246
But bev and her big bazoo
will get the word out

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,323
Quicker than any group
memorandum.

12
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:33,979
Well, that's a relief.

13
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:36,393
Kids! Breakfast is served.

14
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:38,991
I already ate. Oh.

15
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:42,639
- I don't see any breakfast.
- Mimosas!

16
00:00:42,822 --> 00:00:44,139
We're celebrating!

17
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:46,420
Ruth sent over a bottle
of champagne.

18
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,089
So there's no food then?

19
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:50,225
Would you look at this
family?

20
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:52,998
Alexis, pursuing a career in PR.

21
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:55,923
- Hm.
- David, expanding his business.

22
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:57,243
Hm.

23
00:00:57,328 --> 00:01:00,824
Moira, I have no doubt
Broadway will be calling,

24
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,568
Or maybe a pledge drive on PBS.

25
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:05,607
oh, you are sweet.

26
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:08,285
I say we do something
as a family tonight.

27
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,993
Maybe cook a little something?

28
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:11,686
No. I don't think
that's a good idea.

29
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,569
- Absolutely not.
- I mean, look around, family.

30
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:17,945
This won't be our home
for too much longer.

31
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:24,611
So let's celebrate.

32
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:27,519
- Picture.
- Hm.

33
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:29,529
Let's raise those glasses.

34
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:33,645
David? You don't have to look
quite so morose.

35
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,003
You're with your family.

36
00:01:36,423 --> 00:01:39,986
Ah, now that's a framer.

37
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:41,693
You just deleted it.

38
00:01:41,777 --> 00:01:43,257
What's that?

39

41
00:01:50,874 --> 00:01:53,062
is it just me, John,
or does the air not have

42
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:55,394
A particularly lovely
redolence today.

43
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,170
Oh.

44
00:01:56,255 --> 00:01:58,574
Do I detect a scintilla
of lavender?

45
00:01:58,768 --> 00:02:00,953
Isn't it funny how the air
suddenly smells sweeter

46
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,690
Now that you know
we're leaving.

47
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,941
Still doesn't feel real.

48
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:14,864
Roland, you bought a new
truck?

49
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:18,446
Well, Johnny, if you wanna be
an executive,

50
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:21,291
You gotta drive
like an executive.

51
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,825
It might be a bit premature
spending all this money.

52
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,040
Well, what's the point of
having a regular paycheque

53
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,564
If you can't have a little fun
with it, right?

54
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,568
I went to the spa.
Had a pedicure and a blow-out,

55
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,237
At the same time.

56
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,306
I'm surprised I didn't see
you there, Moira,

57
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,908
Celebrating your big
"sunrise bay" news.

58
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,172
And what would that
communiqué entail?

59
00:02:41,257 --> 00:02:42,575
The reboot!

60
00:02:43,214 --> 00:02:44,779
Don't tell me
I'm the first person

61
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,456
To congratulate you!

62
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,405
So it's a go.
Um no, uh,

63
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,254
Unfortunately, I won't be
participating in that

64
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,122
Little vanity project.

65
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,592
Best to keep ones gaze
on the horizon,

66
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,175
Not the posterior view.

67
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,709
- Sure.
- Oh, honey,

68
00:02:59,794 --> 00:03:01,443
I think we better get going.

69
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:03,380
I gotta get the truck back
to the dealership.

70
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:05,514
I told the salesman I was just
taking it around the block.

71
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,379
But then I thought,
maybe some cinnamon buns

72
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:10,385
Might just buy us a sun roof.

73
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:12,571
Bye.

74
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,793
Here, honey,
you hold the buns.

75
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:17,460
I thought they might have
at least called

76
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:19,510
To say they were moving on.

77
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:23,204
Big things are coming your way,
sweetheart.

78
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:25,102
- Don't you worry.
- Okay.

79
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:28,554
I don't. Worry is but
undernourished enthusiasm.

80
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:35,811
Hello.

81
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:38,010
Something's different.

82
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:41,204
Your... Hair.

83
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:43,567
Is in a ponytail
because I didn't wash it.

84
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:45,479
Oh. Okay. It just sort
of looks like

85
00:03:45,564 --> 00:03:47,822
Since you got the deal
you've decided to dress

86
00:03:47,907 --> 00:03:49,184
more professionally.

87
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:52,616
Can I help you with something
in particular, or...

88
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:54,013
Uh, actually, yes.

89
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:55,848
- I need your advice.
- Hm.

90
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:59,492
What says, "Patrick, you're
gonna love New York" more:

91
00:03:59,577 --> 00:04:03,253
A gift card to Joe's pizza
or tickets to "wicked"?

92
00:04:03,364 --> 00:04:06,119
You're taking Patrick
on a trip to New York?

93
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,744
Uh, no. We're moving there
with all of you!

94
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:11,014
What? Do you think we're gonna
stay here all by ourselves?

95
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,875
I'm not moving to New York,
David.

96
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,244
What?

97
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:17,813
We decided that Roland and I
would stay here.

98
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,229
And I'm gonna travel around
and set up all the new motels.

99
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,965
I mean, I realized I didn't
need to live in a big city.

100
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,539
I... guess I just needed
to know that I could.

101
00:04:27,744 --> 00:04:29,064
Mhmm.

102
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:32,588
So I take it you didn't
like the house?

103
00:04:33,658 --> 00:04:36,139
- What house?
- What?

104
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:37,708
What house?

105
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:41,712
Patrick may have been looking
at a house for the two of you.

106
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:43,674
He didn't say anything
about that?

107
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,185
Uh, no.
Like-like to buy?

108
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:50,205
He said that you guys had
driven by it a bunch of times.

109
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:52,605
That house is for sale?

110
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,108
No. I don't know. I...

111
00:04:55,343 --> 00:04:57,061
Can we stop talking
about this?

112
00:04:57,145 --> 00:04:58,978
I feel like I'm doing
something wrong.

113
00:05:04,357 --> 00:05:06,063
So you're finally getting out.

114
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:11,250
Yeah. Um...

115
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:14,744
I should probably go
talk to my husband.

116
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:16,567
Okay.

117

118
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,129
Oh, Alexis, garbage day is
the same for the whole street.

119
00:05:29,214 --> 00:05:31,474
You didn't need to bring your
garbage all the way here.

120
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:35,125
Um, I brought my garbage
here for a reason.

121
00:05:35,464 --> 00:05:38,966
I thought you might like
to wear some of it.

122
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:40,290
What?

123
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:42,303
As you know, David and I
are sharing an apartment

124
00:05:42,388 --> 00:05:45,264
in New York, so I'm like
downsizing a little bit.

125
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:48,695
I can't take all of this,
Alexis.

126
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:50,932
Maybe we can do
another swap?

127
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,859
Or, or, why don't I just go
through it

128
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:54,496
And pay for the ones
I wanna keep?

129
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:56,299
No, twy, I can't take your
money.

130
00:05:56,384 --> 00:05:58,234
I've seen how people tip here.

131
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,838
Alexis, between us,

132
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:01,740
I don't do this job
for the money.

133
00:06:02,146 --> 00:06:03,713
Okay, well, if you don't do
this for money

134
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:06,119
I'm scared to know what you do
do for money.

135
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:13,024
Okay, now that you're leaving,

136
00:06:14,155 --> 00:06:15,351
Can you keep a secret?

137
00:06:15,436 --> 00:06:18,227
Depends on how dark
it's gonna get, but yes.

138
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:22,034
I won some money in the
lottery a few years ago.

139
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,738
Oh my god, Twy! Go you!

140
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:27,685
Why did you not tell me
this before?

141
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:29,553
Well, because you guys
had just gotten here

142
00:06:29,637 --> 00:06:31,422
And, and you had just lost
all your money.

143
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:32,757
Well, what was I gonna say?

144
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:35,053
I just won $92 million?

145
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:38,586
You won $92 million?

146
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:41,123
- Oh, no. Sorry.
- Okay.

147
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,993
Okay, because I literally
was about to pass out.

148
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:47,217
Yeah. No, no. I split the
$92 million with another guy.

149
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:51,785
So you won like...

150
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,705
s-so much money.

151
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,584
Shh. I just...

152
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:58,896
I just don't want anyone know.

153
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:00,835
It changes things.

154
00:07:00,924 --> 00:07:03,075
Twy, what are you doing here?

155
00:07:03,237 --> 00:07:05,489
You could be anywhere,
doing anything.

156
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:08,430
I have everything I need
right here.

157
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:09,927
And if I've learned anything

158
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:11,929
from how my mom spent
the money I gave her,

159
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:14,064
It's that money can buy
a lot of snowmobiles,

160
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:15,574
But it can't buy happiness.

161
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:17,913
So it's about how you live
your life.

162
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:20,604
You know,
doing what makes you smile.

163
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:24,625
And being here,
getting to hear your stories

164
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,143
Over the past few years,

165
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:28,261
Even the scary ones,

166
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:32,883
That makes me smile.

167
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:34,713
Twy,

168
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,145
You might be the best person
I know,

169
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:41,225
But as someone who has had
a lot of money

170
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:44,628
And then not had it and
now is like still pretty poor,

171
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:46,290
But somewhat okay?

172
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,774
Every now and again,

173
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,242
Spending like a little bit
of money

174
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:52,503
on something really special,

175
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,904
It might not buy you happiness,

176
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:58,991
But it can definitely
help make you smile.

177
00:08:08,403 --> 00:08:10,275
This cute dress makes me smile.

178
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,856
Hm.

179
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:14,190
Not quite sure how
that one got in there.

180
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,908
But anything else in there
is yours if you want it.

181
00:08:23,432 --> 00:08:25,814
aw!

182
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:29,270
There you go.

183
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:32,078
John, considering I'll
have some time to fritter

184
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:33,611
Once we're there,
do you think you might

185
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:35,928
- want to put me to work?
- Well, I didn't know

186
00:08:36,013 --> 00:08:37,518
That would be of interest
to you, Moira.

187
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:39,464
But I'll see if I can get you
something.

188
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:42,381
Remember when you were
the Rose Video spokesperson

189
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:44,513
- that one year?
- How could I not?

190
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:48,425
Oh, that photo of me sunbathing
atop a giant VHS tape,

191
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,894
was a staple of Times Square
for a whole season.

192
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:53,030
What do you have there?

193
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:54,271
Well, I don't know,
it's for you.

194
00:08:54,356 --> 00:08:55,622
Oh.

195
00:09:01,104 --> 00:09:02,755
Oh, it's from tippy.

196
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,511
"Dear Moira.
You win.

197
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:06,837
Welcome back to the bay."

198
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:15,332
John, it's a... Tennis bracelet.

199
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:18,673
- What tennis bracelet?
- My tennis bracelet.

200
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:24,970
It's Tippy.

201
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:27,073
Tippy.

202
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:28,859
Yes, I just received it.

203
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,099
Please, tell me this is not
some barbarous jape.

204
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:35,833
Yes. Yes.

205
00:09:36,553 --> 00:09:39,275
My answer is a yes!

206
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,008
A clangorous, vociferous yes.

207
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:46,406
Thank you.
Thank you.

208
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:48,507
What's all that about?

209
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:50,092
"Sunrise bay."

210
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,191
Wow. When forced to choose
between Clifton and myself,

211
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,429
they decided mine
was the bigger name.

212
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:00,796
- What?!
- Yeah.

213
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:02,445
So it's happening?

214
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:04,995
yes. Oh, John.

215
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,156
Thirteen episode order.

216
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:08,706
They've already sent through
two scripts.

217
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,941
And-and I have to start
in two weeks!

218
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,313
Okay. What is everybody
screaming about?

219
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:18,915
"Sunrise Bay".
It's happening.

220
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,419
They've accepted my demands.

221
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:21,988
All of them?

222
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,595
- Even the bracelet?
- Even the bracelet.

223
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,198
And you're giving it to me?

224
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:29,756
No, there are 30 diamonds
on that thing.

225
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:34,221
Our offices will be
in New York.

226
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:37,868
Sounds like we're in
for a tricky commute.

227
00:10:37,952 --> 00:10:39,704
We'll just work it out, John.

228
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:51,264
- Hi.
- Hey.

229
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,877
What are you doin'?

230
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:54,896
I'm just trying
to write my vows.

231
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:56,175
Oh.

232
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,354
Well, if you need some
flattering things to say

233
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,357
about me, I'd me more than
happy to help.

234
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:03,042
- I'm good. Thanks.
- Hm.

235
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:08,162
Why didn't you tell me
about the house?

236
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:12,548
I um,

237
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:17,707
I was gonna wait until after
the wedding to tell you.

238
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:18,742
Hm.

239
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:20,096
'Cause I know how flustered
you can get

240
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:21,865
When there's more than one
thing on your plate.

241
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:24,089
Hm. Unless it's food.

242
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,377
Yeah, and then New York
happened and...

243
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,362
I don't know, it just seemed
kinda pointless.

244
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:31,964
Mhmm.

245
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:35,231
When did that house
even go up for sale?

246
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,860
Well, technically,
it didn't,

247
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:39,029
But after the fourth time
that we drove by it,

248
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:41,286
And you commented that it
reminded you

249
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:44,145
Of Kate winslet's cottage
from "the holiday".

250
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,524
I just knocked on the door
and asked them to call me

251
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:48,261
If they ever decided to sell.

252
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:50,030
Turns out their daughters
are off to college,

253
00:11:50,115 --> 00:11:51,966
And they're moving to Florida.

254
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,145
So that's why you were
so reluctant to move.

255
00:11:55,522 --> 00:11:57,213
It's just hard to picture
living some place

256
00:11:57,297 --> 00:11:59,002
You've never even visited.

257
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:01,217
And I always thought
you didn't like New York.

258
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:04,688
Um, no, uh,
I love New York.

259
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:08,520
It was just a weird time
in my life.

260
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,845
But I don't want you
moving somewhere

261
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,833
That you're not excited about.

262
00:12:14,144 --> 00:12:17,033
I'm excited to be with you.

263
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:19,034
And there are some pros
to being there.

264
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:20,439
I mean, it would open
the business up

265
00:12:20,524 --> 00:12:21,875
to a much larger market.

266
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:24,471
I'd finally get to see a game
at Yankee Stadium.

267
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:27,289
Yeah, and by then you'll
have met some people

268
00:12:27,374 --> 00:12:29,328
That would go
and do that with you.

269
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:33,550
It's gonna be a tough
goodbye.

270
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:34,784
Hm.

271
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:36,971
This is where we started
our life together.

272
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,473
Yeah.

273
00:12:50,884 --> 00:12:52,870
why have I not been
told about

274
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:54,671
The double-Decker sightseeing
tour.

275
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,008
Well, we wanted to show
our support for your move

276
00:12:58,092 --> 00:12:59,298
To the big apple!

277
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,901
Yeah, we heard that
"Sunrise Bay"

278
00:13:00,986 --> 00:13:03,071
was moving on without you,
but who needs them?

279
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:05,848
- Well, you know...
- I say, fuck 'em.

280
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:07,785
- Veronica!
- No, she's right, Moira,

281
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:10,718
They'd be lucky to have you
on their two-bit show.

282
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:13,541
Yeah, and reboots are never
as good as the original.

283
00:13:13,922 --> 00:13:17,675
Well, aren't you a wolf pack
by which any gal

284
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,763
would be so lucky
to be protected.

285
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,900
But it's time for this pup
to disperse to new territory.

286
00:13:24,313 --> 00:13:28,096
"Sunrise Bay" called with
an irresistible offer.

287
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:31,675
That's great, Mrs. Rose.

288
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,381
I mean, who doesn't love
a reboot.

289
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:35,923
So what does this mean?

290
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:38,848
Alas, as much as it pains
to say,

291
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:41,818
this will Mark my last
rehearsal with you all.

292
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,861
oh my goodness.

293
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:45,823
Oh, thanks for the heads up.

294
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:49,622
- Camera waits for no one.
- Wow. Moira...

295
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:52,869
I'm not as prepared for this
as I thought I would be.

296
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:55,944
- Veronica.
- Hm.

297
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:58,481
I suppose you have something
in your eye?

298
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:01,737
No. I just-I just don't like
surprises.

299
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:03,740
We should-we should get
started.

300
00:14:03,824 --> 00:14:05,075
Yeah.

301
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:09,818
May-may I just proclaim
that I have rarely...

302
00:14:09,903 --> 00:14:12,082
never... I've never felt more
buttress

303
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,593
than I have in your company,
dear gals.

304
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:18,007
Not to flog a metaphor but...

305
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:20,690
wolf pups are born blind
and deaf,

306
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:25,095
And in your care I have learned
to see and hear

307
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:27,631
the beauty in the bucolic.

308
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:30,977
What's this? What?

309
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:32,960
Oh no. No.
Let's not turn this

310
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:34,497
into a hallmark movie
of the week.

311
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:36,840
I've done enough of those
for a lifetime. Okay?

312
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:38,722
Maybe just a quick one.

313
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:41,359
Yeah.

314
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,950
come in.

315
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,623
Hey Twy! Is everything okay?

316
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,091
Did I forget to pay
for brunch again?

317
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:54,590
Oh. No. You remembered.
Today.

318
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:56,393
- Okay.
- Anyway... Um...

319
00:14:57,137 --> 00:14:58,879
I wanted to come
and tell you that

320
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,131
What you said to me this
morning really resonated.

321
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:04,630
Twy. That means so much.
Um,

322
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,332
Um... What part of what I said,
specifically?

323
00:15:08,455 --> 00:15:11,205
Oh. That I shouldn't be
afraid to spend money

324
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,008
On things that are special
to me.

325
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:15,394
- Mhmm.
- So...

326
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:19,416
I bought the café.
What?!

327
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,486
I called the owners and told
them to name their price.

328
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,762
Okay, I was talking more
like a spa day

329
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:27,914
Or like a cute little anklet
or something.

330
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:31,777
It's something that will
make me smile.

331
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,082
Twyla's café tropical.

332
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,624
It's got a nice ring to it,
right?

333
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:42,366
Yeah.
Or like "Twyla's café".

334
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,481
Yeah, I don't think so.

335
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,943
- Twy, I'm so happy for you.
- Oh.

336
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:49,589
You deserve it.

337
00:15:49,674 --> 00:15:51,459
Thank you, Alexis.

338
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,133
And you deserve this.

339
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,234
Oh my god. Twy.

340
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:01,923
It's for all your dresses.
Most of them fit.

341
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:04,027
And whatever doesn't
I'll just give to my mom.

342
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:05,648
Okay. That's so sweet,

343
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:08,015
But those dresses would never
sell for this much,

344
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,350
Like not even in retail.

345
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:11,168
Consider it a goodbye present.

346
00:16:11,494 --> 00:16:14,309
A little something to help
you start your new life.

347
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:19,188
Maybe even enough to get you
your own place.

348
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,189
You're gonna do great things,
Alexis.

349
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:23,874
No, I know.

350
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:27,390
But I can't accept this.

351
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,552
Even though I know
I'm gonna regret it,

352
00:16:29,637 --> 00:16:31,042
In like a minute.

353
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:33,757
I think that if I'm gonna
do this on my own,

354
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:37,042
I need to do this on my own.

355
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:39,111
I respect that.

356
00:16:42,219 --> 00:16:44,036
oh.

357
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:49,507
Hey, I don't mean to tell you
how to spend your money,

358
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,942
But maybe you could use some
of it to come visit me?

359
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,847
I'd like that.

360
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:57,596
Boop.

361
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:02,853
Hey Twy,

362
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:05,088
Like, cute dress.

363
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:07,123
Thanks.

364
00:17:07,254 --> 00:17:09,288
My friend gave it to me.

365
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:29,724
- David...
- Hm?

366
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:33,505
This might seem like a really
stupid question, but um...

367
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:35,836
Why are we here?

368
00:17:36,103 --> 00:17:37,556
Because I felt like
I owed it to Patrick

369
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,306
to at least see the place
where he wanted us

370
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,941
to spend the rest of our lives.

371
00:17:42,243 --> 00:17:43,498
And?

372
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:45,755
And it's way too small
for the rest of our lives,

373
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,274
But it's cute.

374
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,910
Okay, so we just drove here
to look at a place

375
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:53,846
That you don't plan
on living in?

376
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:56,743
Correct.

377
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,177
How many years have I known you,

378
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:03,662
And I still can't figure out
what goes on inside your head.

379
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:06,500
Join the club.

380
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:13,568
That was a joke,
in case it didn't land.

381
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:14,904
Hmm.

382
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:17,419
No, I was just thinking about

383
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:19,402
How Patrick must have driven
out here,

384
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:20,855
And knocked on that door

385
00:18:20,948 --> 00:18:22,399
And asked those people
to call him

386
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:23,800
If they ever planned on selling

387
00:18:23,884 --> 00:18:25,147
Just because I...

388
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:27,402
I said it was nice.

389
00:18:27,978 --> 00:18:29,882
Who does that?

390
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:33,783
Good people.

391
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,404
Good people do things
like that.

392
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:40,956
Hence the reason why
we don't understand it.

393
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,741
Mhmm.

394
00:18:44,475 --> 00:18:45,926
Can I ask you a question?

395
00:18:46,113 --> 00:18:47,913
Yes.

396
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:51,213
What is it about New York?

397
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:55,507
I have big dreams.

398
00:18:57,285 --> 00:18:59,903
And you can't have those
dreams here?

399
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:03,037
And some friends left there.

400
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:07,425
The "friends" who you invited
to the wedding?

401
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,987
To name a few, yes.

402
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:11,889
David, they're not coming.

403
00:19:12,332 --> 00:19:14,717
Apparently there was an
electronic music festival

404
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:16,993
in Norway that took priority.

405
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:21,656
Why do you wanna go back
to a place

406
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:23,976
That's done nothing
but hurt your feelings?

407
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,914
Because I want those people
to know that I'm not a joke.

408
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:32,512
And that I've won.

409
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:34,483
David, look at this place.

410
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:36,506
You've won.

411
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,675
And on a personal note,

412
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:42,145
I don't want you
to leave me here, okay?

413
00:19:50,504 --> 00:19:52,504
Did you put on deodorant
today?

414
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:55,276
Excuse me?

415
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,946
I know, it might be the farm.

416
00:19:57,378 --> 00:19:59,629
- It's the farm.
- Okay.

417
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:01,364
I smelled something.

418
00:20:01,448 --> 00:20:02,737
- It's not me!
- All right!

419
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:04,714
- We're leaving!
- Relax.

420
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:11,241
Kids, food's here.

421
00:20:11,817 --> 00:20:13,550
mmmm.

422
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:17,047
Wait. One pizza?
What is this, les mis?

423
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:19,983
Yes, it's a dignified
family symposium, David.

424
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:23,386
Not some all-one can-
consume smorgasbord.

425
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,488
- Don't be an animal, son.
- David! Ugh.

426
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:26,848
- Ugh!
- Ugh.

427
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:28,438
Okay. So what are the plans
for tonight?

428
00:20:28,523 --> 00:20:30,575
Because I might be meeting Twy
for a drink.

429
00:20:30,678 --> 00:20:32,729
Well, I thought we'd
all stay in tonight,

430
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:35,331
And enjoy the pizza
and play charades?

431
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:36,899
Charades.

432
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:38,735
I'm going to have to gracefully
bow out.

433
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:41,505
I don't think you can
afford my quote anymore.

434
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:45,275
Just saying it out loud
makes it so real.

435
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,644
Well, I suppose I should
let you both know

436
00:20:48,728 --> 00:20:51,014
That there's been a slight
change of plans.

437
00:20:51,098 --> 00:20:53,683
As you've heard, your mother
is going back to work.

438
00:20:54,726 --> 00:20:58,381
And we'll be heading
to California.

439
00:20:58,505 --> 00:20:59,940
Now, I've I made some calls

440
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,958
And I'll be setting up shop
out west for the time being.

441
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:04,961
Ooh, so it's just David
and me

442
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:06,712
Going to New York then?

443
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:09,293
Um...

444
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:13,075
I have something to say.

445
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:15,526
- The wedding's off.
- No. The wedding is not...

446
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:17,789
Why would the wedding be off?

447
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:21,140
Patrick found us a house.

448
00:21:21,803 --> 00:21:24,656
Okay, I don't know how
we'd be able to afford a house.

449
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,300
The house is here.

450
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:30,571
I think we're going to stay.

451
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:32,455
- What?
- David,

452
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:34,724
Are sure you've given
this sentencing

453
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:36,560
Adequate deliberation?

454
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:39,806
I just don't think
I'm finished with this place.

455
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,998
My business is here.

456
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:43,733
My...

457
00:21:44,023 --> 00:21:45,890
My husband is here.

458
00:21:46,948 --> 00:21:48,999
And I'm just not ready
to mess that up...

459
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:51,023
Just yet.

460
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:56,132
I'm sorry, I said I would
share a place with you.

461
00:21:56,518 --> 00:22:00,884
So does this mean you'll be
coming with us, Alexis?

462
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:03,807
Um, no.

463
00:22:04,582 --> 00:22:07,621
I think it means that I'm gonna
be flying solo to New York.

464
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:10,150
I've done it before,
and I can do it again.

465
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:12,028
You take that Ember
of independence

466
00:22:12,112 --> 00:22:13,897
And you keep it burning.

467
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:17,701
Because you, my darling,
are destined to be on fire!

468
00:22:17,785 --> 00:22:21,170
Well, I could not be more
proud of my family

469
00:22:21,254 --> 00:22:22,839
than I am right now.

470
00:22:23,206 --> 00:22:27,282
And as much as I'll miss this...
being together...

471
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:30,383
At least I can go to sleep
knowing

472
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:32,649
We're all gonna be okay.

473
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:37,054
So when are you leaving?

474
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:38,977
September 3rd.

475
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:41,321
That's my wedding day.

476
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,016
And we're tied to the third?

477
00:22:46,148 --> 00:22:48,700
- Oh Moira...
- Am I tied to the third?

478
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,103
Of course you're getting
married on the third, David.

479
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:53,420
Moira, we can leave first
thing the next morning.

480
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,089
Yes. We will, John.

481
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:57,840
It's just worth noting that
the lie-flat seats were only

482
00:22:57,924 --> 00:22:59,985
on the evening flight.
Moira.

483
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:01,832
- It's okay.
- Unbelievable.

484
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,588
okay.

485
00:23:09,962 --> 00:23:11,457
David, what is going on?

486
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:12,744
You're wearing a blindfold.

487
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:14,576
I'm not just gonna tell you
what's going on.

488
00:23:15,954 --> 00:23:19,178
okay. You can take it off now.

489
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:23,749
Hmm.

490
00:23:25,073 --> 00:23:28,282
Hey, you do know that I've
already seen this house, right?

491
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,214
I do.

492
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:32,483
So then why are we here?

493
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:35,560
Because I put an offer in.

494
00:23:35,858 --> 00:23:37,525
And they accepted.

495
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,640
What?
What about New York?

496
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:42,101
I thought that's where
you wanted to be?

497
00:23:42,196 --> 00:23:43,330
I thought so, too.

498
00:23:43,415 --> 00:23:46,040
But it's not where
you wanna be.

499
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,940
And I don't wanna be anywhere
you don't wanna be.

500
00:23:50,165 --> 00:23:52,683
David, I promise I will make
you so happy here.

501
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:54,769
You fuckin' better.

502
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:04,646
Wait. So when you say
you put an offer in...

503
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:07,016
- Yes.
- What exactly did you do?

504
00:24:07,293 --> 00:24:09,412
Um, I don't really know.

505
00:24:09,496 --> 00:24:11,747
You might wanna call them.
Call the people.

506
00:24:11,831 --> 00:24:13,499
Yeah, no. I'm definitely
gonna look at that offer.

507
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,031
Mhmm.

508
00:24:16,445 --> 00:24:18,434
You know, at this point
who even needs a wedding,

509
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,524
Am I right?
Oh, I do.

510
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:21,831
I need a wedding. Big time.

510
00:24:22,305 --> 00:24:28,400

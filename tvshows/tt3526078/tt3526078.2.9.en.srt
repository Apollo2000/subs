1
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:07,421
- Well, how's that for timing!
- What do you mean?

2
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:10,324
We both stepped out exactly together.

3
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:12,292
We didn't time this.

4
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:14,027
I know we didn't... time it.

5
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:16,797
- What's your point?
- That is my point!

6
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:18,732
We-we both stepped out,

7
00:00:18,766 --> 00:00:20,667
and we didn't know the other
person was stepping out,

8
00:00:20,702 --> 00:00:22,502
at exactly the same time!

9
00:00:22,537 --> 00:00:24,037
Yeah, why are you
yelling at me right now?

10
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:26,239
Well, I'm just explaining
the good timing of this,

11
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:28,008
when no explanation is needed.

12
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:30,577
It's just, it's the good timing, it's...

13
00:00:31,523 --> 00:00:34,114
Okay fine, I don't
get it, but, whatever.

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,304
Oh my God, is that David?

15
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:44,093
Oh...

16
00:00:44,118 --> 00:00:45,518
Oh, hey.

17
00:00:45,727 --> 00:00:48,161
David, where did you get this car?

18
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:50,030
Oh, this car was paid
for by my employer.

19
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:52,466
We felt I needed a more
efficient way to get to work.

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,468
So she bought you a car?!

21
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:55,984
It's a rental.

22
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:57,677
Do you think I'd allow
someone to buy that car for me?

23
00:00:57,702 --> 00:01:00,273
Well, this-this is so great.

24
00:01:00,308 --> 00:01:01,942
Thank God we have a car again!

25
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:04,678
Um, very unclear on the
"we" part of that sentence.

26
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:06,152
Yeah, your brother's right, Alexis,

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,881
this is his car, not ours.

28
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:10,007
We don't have a car, and he does.

29
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:12,319
Okay, are you okay?

30
00:01:12,353 --> 00:01:14,988
Yes, yes, i-I'm just happy

31
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:17,557
the Roses are moving up in the world.

32
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:19,559
There's a button missing on your jacket.

33
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:21,662
- What?
- Oh ew, you poor thing.

34
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,103
-- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe --

35
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:30,637
Are those... turkey sausages?

36
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,273
Yes.

37
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,209
Well, maybe, maybe I'll just sample one.

38
00:01:36,244 --> 00:01:37,744
Okay.

39
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:39,713
Everything okay over here?

40
00:01:39,747 --> 00:01:42,162
Yes it is, Twyla. Just great.

41
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:44,117
If uh, if you could add this to our tab,

42
00:01:44,152 --> 00:01:45,686
that would be wonderful.

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,221
Add it to your tab. Yeah, um...

44
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:50,046
What, is there a problem?

45
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:54,428
Unfortunately, we can't put
any more on your tab, Mr. Rose.

46
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:56,163
We have a limit as to how
much you can charge on it

47
00:01:56,197 --> 00:01:59,046
without actually making
any effort to pay.

48
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,921
Oh, I see.

49
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,404
So, here's your bill.

50
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,973
Okay, thank you. Just uh...

51
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:10,077
Leave this with me, Twyla,
and I'll take care of it um...

52
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:12,646
This afternoon, or... tomorrow.

53
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,312
This afternoon would be great.

54
00:02:14,982 --> 00:02:17,484
Well then, this afternoon it is!

55
00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:19,986
And if not, then you know, tomorrow.

56
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:20,945
Morning.

57
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:23,781
Morning. Tomorrow morning.

58
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:25,507
Thank you!

59
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:29,877
Um, what is going on?

60
00:02:29,902 --> 00:02:31,737
Oh, nothing, nothing.
Nothing's going on.

61
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:34,101
It's just I've gotta
move some money around,

62
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:36,570
make sure things are... liquid.

63
00:02:36,604 --> 00:02:38,972
- How much trouble are we in?
- Who said we're in trouble?

64
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:40,540
I have dated enough Wall Street losers

65
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:43,543
to know that "making things
liquid" is not a good thing!

66
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:45,445
No, no, we're fine. We're fine, honey.

67
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,749
No, no, I just had to use my
unemployment check this month

68
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:52,289
to pay for all the raw
milk that "we" ordered.

69
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:54,203
Okay...

70
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:57,577
Um, well like, what can I do?

71
00:02:57,658 --> 00:02:59,993
Just don't tell your mother, okay?

72
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:01,328
Or your brother, I mean,

73
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:03,163
they're too fragile to handle this.

74
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:05,148
And no one really needs to worry.

75
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:09,436
Well, you might wanna
tell that to your face.

76
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,214
Oh you are here, thank goodness!

77
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:25,101
Stevie, does this computer
get Internet access?

78
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,987
It does.

79
00:03:27,021 --> 00:03:28,562
Please log on immediately.

80
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:31,231
Okay...

81
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:34,875
Jocelyn has made
allusions to certain...

82
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:37,429
Sensitive photographs from my past.

83
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:40,667
Uh, are you sure you don't
want me to just leave you

84
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:42,169
to do this on your own?

85
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:43,603
No, I can't type,

86
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:46,375
and I don't care to relive
my days as a secretary.

87
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,375
Oh... okay.

88
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,143
Uh, just give me a minute,

89
00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:53,796
because we're only one small
step above dial up here.

90
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,116
It's hardly surprising that Jocelyn

91
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,084
would suddenly uncover
these in the middle

92
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:00,109
of a political campaign.

93
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:05,679
I suppose I just expected more from her.

94
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:11,781
Okay, there's a bunch
of you with O.J. Simpson.

95
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,562
And you with Robert Blake.

96
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:17,204
"The top eleven
photographs of Moira Rose

97
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:19,372
with future murder suspects."

98
00:04:19,407 --> 00:04:21,875
Well, that's not what I'm looking for!

99
00:04:21,976 --> 00:04:23,810
Why were you in a paddle
boat with Phil Spector?

100
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:25,601
And doesn't he looks good?

101
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:27,948
That was the one time he
let me play with his hair.

102
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:29,616
It was a sunny aft... you know,

103
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,195
I shouldn't have to explain myself.

104
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:34,454
Okay well, there's a bunch
here that could qualify

105
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:36,898
as incriminating, so...

106
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:38,554
Okay.

107
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:43,496
I did a series of very tasteful nudes

108
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:47,467
with Richard Avedon, in the 70's.

109
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,703
I see. Um...

110
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:52,505
This is really not in
my job description so...

111
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,828
Why aren't they coming up?

112
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,942
What, do you have some
kind of childproof lock

113
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:57,577
on this Internet?

114
00:04:57,612 --> 00:05:00,280
Hm, nope, that would
make my job very boring.

115
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:02,093
Oh, keep scrolling, please.

116
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:06,086
See David, this is what happens 
when you wash your face

117
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,488
with a bar of motel hand soap!

118
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:11,024
It's a zit. People get zits.

119
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:14,127
I mean, I've always
had clean, radiant skin,

120
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:15,528
but I'm an anomaly.

121
00:05:15,563 --> 00:05:16,963
It's not a zit, David.

122
00:05:16,998 --> 00:05:19,532
I think it's just my
anxiety clogging up my pores.

123
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,568
And forming zits.

124
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:24,237
Oh! Ohhh my God, no!

125
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:26,940
- What is going on with you?!
- I need to save this!

126
00:05:26,974 --> 00:05:29,142
Wait, you're gonna
put that on your face,

127
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:30,543
after it's been on the floor?

128
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:31,978
I don't even wear good socks in here!

129
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:33,480
Okay, there are things
going on right now

130
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:34,804
that you don't know about.

131
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:35,875
Like what?

132
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,052
Like things I that
can't talk about, okay?!

133
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:39,671
I know about your dandruff shampoo.

134
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:41,187
That is preventative,

135
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:42,822
and that is not what I'm talking about!

136
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:45,659
David! David, please!

137
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:47,093
Hey! Wait, can you help me please?

138
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:48,728
- No, I can't help you!
- Can you help me please?!

139
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:50,789
No! Moira: David, it's urgent!

140
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:53,274
What is it?

141
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,372
Darling, I'm afraid
you and I have arrived

142
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:03,922
at an... awkward moment in our
parent/child relationship.

143
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,516
I'd argue that moment happens daily.

144
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:10,717
It seems that there are some...
nude photographs of me

145
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:12,085
- on the Internet...
- Oh!

146
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:14,354
And I would like you to search for them.

147
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:16,056
That's a real quick no.

148
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,692
Um, you can ask literally anyone else.

149
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,360
No, I tried to ask Stevie,

150
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:22,429
but her computer is several years old,

151
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,352
and apparently quite prudish.

152
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,866
If someone has to find
naked pictures of me,

153
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:29,469
better you than a
stranger in a storm cellar!

154
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,705
- Is it though?
- What's going on?

155
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:34,274
There are nude photos of
me all over the Internet.

156
00:06:34,308 --> 00:06:36,576
Um, are you sure you're
not thinking of mine?

157
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,289
Nothing's coming up.

158
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:41,181
What search words did you use?

159
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:43,483
Uh, your name, and "nude."

160
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:45,285
Three words I thought
I'd only have to type

161
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,969
if I was held at gunpoint.

162
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:49,906
Okay, try "effervescence."

163
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:52,797
No, I'm sorry, "small umbrella."

164
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:56,587
No wait, "Siamese eels."

165
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:03,236
Oh... okay, no. There was nothing.

166
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,295
I don't see anything.

167
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,539
You don't understand,
we must find them,

168
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:08,477
so we can then get rid of them!

169
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:10,211
Honestly!

170
00:07:11,012 --> 00:07:14,414
Can no one find nude photos
of me on the Internet?!

171
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:18,820
♪

172
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:23,352
- Hey!
- Hey!

173
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:26,059
Um, could I have like, a glass of water,

174
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:28,061
or if there's a tap
outside, or like, a hose.

175
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:30,930
- I can get you a tea.
- Thanks, Twy.

176
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:35,935
Between you and me,

177
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,805
I know how hard it
can be to pay off debt.

178
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,939
My Uncle Ken only has three fingers now,

179
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:41,908
which is too bad, because he's deaf,

180
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:44,164
and he only speaks using
sign language, but...

181
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,029
He made his choices.
- Mhmm...

182
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:52,619
The amount of times that
I run into you in this place

183
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:54,836
is like, out of a romantic comedy.

184
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:57,117
I'm sorry, what?

185
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,093
- Is everything okay?
- Um...

186
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:01,861
Yeah, totally.

187
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:03,530
I mean, I have a pimple
because I washed my face

188
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:05,805
with dirty hand soap, but, no biggie.

189
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,034
Yeah, just don't look at it.

190
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:10,003
Thanks.

191
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:11,871
One tea, on the house.

192
00:08:11,906 --> 00:08:14,107
- Thanks, Twy.
- No smoothie today?

193
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:17,410
No, not today, I um, I
forgot my purse at home.

194
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:18,945
Oh well, if you want a smoothie,

195
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:20,380
I can get you a smoothie.

196
00:08:20,414 --> 00:08:21,748
No, no, no, no, don't worry,

197
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:23,430
because then I would
have to pay you back,

198
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:24,945
which is gonna be hard because
my entire family is broke,

199
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,695
and we can't afford
to eat right now, so.

200
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,398
Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that.

201
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:32,469
Mhmm, me too.

202
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:36,262
Well hey, I don't know

203
00:08:36,297 --> 00:08:37,797
if this is something
you'd be interested in,

204
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:40,166
but my secretary just quit,

205
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:42,961
and if you need the cash...

206
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:45,705
That's so sweet, but I
would be uncomfortable

207
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:47,188
accepting free money.

208
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:49,976
No, no, you'd be working.

209
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,211
Doing her job, and I
would pay you for it.

210
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:53,617
Oh!

211
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:58,180
But there would be animals
around all the time?

212
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:00,059
That is generally what one can expect

213
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:01,906
when working at a vet clinic, yes.

214
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:04,858
Hmm!

215
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:10,894
Well, thanks for the ride.

216
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:12,866
We've really been taking
advantage of those rides,

217
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,227
haven't we?

218
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:18,805
You know, I never thought
I'd be in this situation.

219
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,453
Getting a ride home from work by my son.

220
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:24,656
That's the situation you
never thought you'd be in?

221
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:29,682
Um... I need to go to Elmdale, so...

222
00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:31,451
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Working man!

223
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:32,852
- Yes.
- Busy busy.

224
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:34,000
Mhmm.

225
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:38,172
You know it's funny,

226
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:41,774
it didn't seem that long ago that
you were relying on me for everything.

227
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:44,731
Like when you were taking
your harpsichord lessons,

228
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:46,633
- and I would drive you.
- I was seven.

229
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:49,302
All the lessons that I paid for,

230
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:51,604
- and schooling...
- Okay, what is happening here?

231
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,073
Nothing, nothing, I'm having
a little chat with my son,

232
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:55,475
that's all, do I have to pay for that?

233
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:57,094
Last I heard, you didn't have to pay...

234
00:09:57,119 --> 00:10:00,213
You and Alexis, I've been
getting some very weird vibes.

235
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:01,648
What did Alexis say? What did she say?!

236
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:03,316
Well, she-she didn't say anything.

237
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,151
- Should she have said something?
- No, no.

238
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:07,875
- What is going on?!
- It's...

239
00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:12,258
I've over extended a
little bit this month.

240
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,429
Financially, I-I could
use some gap financing,

241
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:17,750
that's all.

242
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:20,099
Well, should I be concerned?

243
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:22,435
- No, no.
- Well, how bad is it?

244
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:24,504
It's pretty bad, it's pretty bad,

245
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:27,295
and you know, this is
so awkward for a... father

246
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,475
- to come to a son for money.
- Well, believe it or not,

247
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,077
this is actually not the most awkward

248
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:33,586
parent/son request
I've gotten today, so...

249
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:40,555
If you need money, I can give you money.

250
00:10:43,324 --> 00:10:44,625
Well, thank you, David.

251
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:47,406
So...

252
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:51,731
Oh my God! What are you doing?

253
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:53,203
Well, I was trying to give you a hug.

254
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:55,234
- I-I get the gesture.
- I should've undone the seatbelt.

255
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:57,102
Okay, well then, let's
just leave it at a gesture.

256
00:10:57,127 --> 00:10:58,859
- Okay, let's just leave it.
- Um yeah, let's leave it.

257
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:00,440
- High five, son. - Uh well,
okay, okay. - All right, okay.

258
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:04,053
So, I've been thinking about the
job ***

259
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:06,695
and I have decided that I am interested.

260
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,914
Great!

261
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:09,695
But I would like to interview for it.

262
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,922
Just like everybody else.

263
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:12,578
Are you... sure about that?

264
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:14,079
Because I already offered you the job.

265
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:16,582
No I know, I just, I don't
want any special treatment.

266
00:11:16,616 --> 00:11:18,884
And it's really important to me

267
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,653
that I feel like I really earned this.

268
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,598
Okay, uh, have a seat.

269
00:11:23,623 --> 00:11:25,257
Okay.

270
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,241
Okay...

271
00:11:31,352 --> 00:11:32,797
Ahem!

272
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:35,234
Okay! So...

273
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:37,244
Just... a second.

274
00:11:39,673 --> 00:11:41,672
- Okay.
- Okay.

275
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:44,609
Have you ever worked as
a receptionist before?

276
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:46,512
That would be a no,

277
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:48,714
but I have dealt with a
lot of receptionists before,

278
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:50,836
and so I feel like I have
the right temperament for it.

279
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:52,922
Okay, and how are your typing skills?

280
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,117
Well, you've seen me text.

281
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:59,031
Mhmm... and how are you at spreadsheets?

282
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:01,493
Okay, I'm just gonna
stop you right there.

283
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:03,228
I'm loving this Q and A,

284
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:05,197
but I think what's important right now,

285
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:07,195
is my positive attitude.

286
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:09,201
And I don't wanna brag,

287
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:12,672
but "Us Weekly" once described
me as "up for anything."

288
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,975
- So...
- O-kay.

289
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:17,810
Yeah, great.

290
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:20,613
Well, I think that's all the
information that I need for now,

291
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:23,549
so thank you very much for your time,

292
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,250
and I will be in touch.

293
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:27,336
Thank you very much for your time.

294
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:31,256
- Did I get the job?
- Yeah, yes. You got the job.

295
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,392
Okay! Okay.

296
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:34,793
You're a really good actor.

297
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:35,906
Thanks.

298
00:12:35,931 --> 00:12:37,298
You're welcome.

299
00:12:42,585 --> 00:12:45,359
Stevie, I knew I could 
trust you to find them.

300
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:47,506
The only thing is, if 
you want me to print it,

301
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,141
our printer's not working.

302
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:50,914
Oh dear.

303
00:12:51,444 --> 00:12:53,679
Yeah, all those online
perverts should be put

304
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:55,881
in a paddle boat, and sent out to sea.

305
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:57,336
No, that's not me.

306
00:12:58,218 --> 00:12:59,585
That's your face.

307
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:01,720
Yes, it's my character
from "Sunrise Bay,"

308
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:04,323
but it's been put on the
body of what I can only assume

309
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:06,422
is an Indonesian lady boy.

310
00:13:06,906 --> 00:13:08,594
Ohhh!

311
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:10,992
I thought maybe you just had a tan.

312
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:13,899
So this is it.

313
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:15,336
Yeah, I think so.

314
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,703
Um, I would really rather
not dive any deeper.

315
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:19,304
No, it's not necessary.

316
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:21,240
Because I ended up in some
really scary, dark places

317
00:13:21,274 --> 00:13:24,672
of the Internet that I would
rather not revisit, so...

318
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:28,914
I am suddenly overwhelmed with regret.

319
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:31,417
It's a new feeling for me,

320
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:33,844
and I don't find it at all pleasurable.

321
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:37,695
You regret that embarrassing
photos of you aren't online?

322
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:40,438
No, I regret that they're lost.

323
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:45,731
They were the one perfect
memorial to who I once was.

324
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:50,969
And I should've appreciated
those firm round mammae,

325
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:53,563
and Callipygian ass, while I had them.

326
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:56,867
If you're talking about your body, uh...

327
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:59,602
I think you still look amazing.

328
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:03,649
Then allow me to offer you some advice.

329
00:14:03,683 --> 00:14:08,539
Take a thousand naked
pictures of yourself now.

330
00:14:08,988 --> 00:14:11,852
You may currently think,
"oh, I'm too spooky."

331
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:15,547
Or, "nobody wants to
see these tiny boobies."

332
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:19,598
But believe me, one day you
will look at those photos,

333
00:14:19,632 --> 00:14:21,700
with much kinder eyes and say,

334
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,711
"dear God, I was a beautiful thing!"

335
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,438
- Will I?
- Mhmm.

336
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:34,413
Oh, and make sure you submit
those photos to the Internet.

337
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:37,116
Otherwise, your own children
will go looking for them one day

338
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,055
and tragically, they won't be there.

339
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:44,590
Okay, so how much money do you need?

340
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:45,991
And please keep in mind that

341
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:47,760
I had a negative balance
in there last week.

342
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,528
Yeah, whatever you can spare.

343
00:14:49,562 --> 00:14:51,945
You know, a couple hundred, three...

344
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:55,500
Four... Okay, how much do
you actually need, though?

345
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:57,984
$560.00

346
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:00,891
so my entire paycheck, then.

347
00:15:03,004 --> 00:15:04,371
Okay.

348
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:08,147
- What just happened?
- I don't know.

349
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:10,115
It says there's an error with your pin.

350
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,084
- I can see that! I can see that!
- All right.

351
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:13,452
- All right, calm down, calm down.
- I can see that!

352
00:15:13,486 --> 00:15:14,987
You only get a few chances here.

353
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:16,622
I just must've typed
in the pin number wrong.

354
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:18,490
It's actually just "pin,"
you don't have to say,

355
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:19,354
"pin number,"
that's redundant.

356
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:20,726
Okay, okay, wow, are you
doing this right now?!

357
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,494
Sorry, sorry, sorry, go ahead.

358
00:15:26,432 --> 00:15:27,766
What is going on?!

359
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,568
All right, first of all,
just stop for one second,

360
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:31,703
because you've only got one
more chance at this, all right?

361
00:15:31,738 --> 00:15:33,405
So focus on the numbers!

362
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:34,840
I know my number!

363
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:37,209
It's the same pin number
that I've had for years!

364
00:15:37,243 --> 00:15:38,644
The same "pin!"

365
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:40,779
Okay, can you just take a...
take a big step!

366
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,380
Thank you so much!

367
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:43,048
All right, remember,
this is your last chance!

368
00:15:43,082 --> 00:15:44,416
Arghhh!

369
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:50,189
- What just happened?
- Well, it ate my card.

370
00:15:50,223 --> 00:15:51,957
- Well, press eject!
- There's no eject on this machine!

371
00:15:51,991 --> 00:15:53,572
Well, what this? There's eject.

372
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:55,064
That's "cancel," that
doesn't do anything!

373
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:56,250
All right, press
the green one!

374
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:58,063
- I'm pressing "cancel,"
- Okay, nothing happens!

375
00:15:58,097 --> 00:15:59,454
- Well, press something else!
- What do you want me to do?!

376
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:00,556
- Get the card back!
- We can't get the card back!

377
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:02,693
Why?

378
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,004
Wow!

379
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,506
So I was able to retrieve it,

380
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,174
and it looks like this is a new card.

381
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:10,976
Thank you, yeah, it is a new card.

382
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,411
Did you use the proper pin?

383
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:13,704
Yeah, that's what I asked him.

384
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:15,747
Of course I used the proper pin.

385
00:16:16,556 --> 00:16:18,383
I know my pin number, it's my birthday.

386
00:16:18,418 --> 00:16:20,064
Happy Birthday!

387
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,954
No, the pin number is my birthday.

388
00:16:21,988 --> 00:16:23,355
He keeps saying pin number.

389
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:25,524
Did you start with the
temporary pin that we sent you?

390
00:16:25,558 --> 00:16:26,959
What? What temporary pin?

391
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:29,494
- Ah, see?
- No "see!"

392
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:30,963
None of that, listen!

393
00:16:30,997 --> 00:16:33,799
I phoned someone here,
a teller, I think,

394
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,236
who told me that I didn't
need a temporary pin number!

395
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,704
Oh, which teller?

396
00:16:38,738 --> 00:16:40,197
Because it's only me and Carol here.

397
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:44,877
It was a while ago.

398
00:16:44,911 --> 00:16:47,012
It says the account
was opened last week.

399
00:16:47,046 --> 00:16:48,814
Okay, I just need to take
out some money for my dad.

400
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:51,259
Um, because my family is in debt.

401
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:56,064
So if you could help me help him,

402
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:58,023
that would be a wonderful thing.

403
00:16:58,057 --> 00:17:00,292
Of course, I just need
you to pick a new pin.

404
00:17:00,326 --> 00:17:01,290
Okay.

405
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:04,858
It's
7-2-8-3.

406
00:17:05,064 --> 00:17:06,932
Sir, you just said your pin out loud.

407
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:08,600
So I suggest you pick another one.

408
00:17:08,635 --> 00:17:11,103
- What about my birthday?
- No!

409
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:12,822
- It's easy.
- It's not easy.

410
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:15,095
Nothing's easy about this.

411
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,902
Okay, where... what?

412
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:22,603
I never saw myself
having like, a normal job.

413
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,284
But I think it's gonna be kinda
nice to make money and stuff,

414
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:27,806
and like, help out a bit more.

415
00:17:27,987 --> 00:17:29,470
You're working for your ex.

416
00:17:30,156 --> 00:17:32,124
David, Ted wouldn't have hired me

417
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:33,759
if he thought it was a bad idea!

418
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:36,161
Ted also proposed to you twice,

419
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:38,063
so I'd say Ted's decision making skills

420
00:17:38,097 --> 00:17:39,464
are a little suspect.

421
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:40,899
Okay, well I will have you know

422
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,601
that I went through the
same interview process

423
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:43,986
as everybody else.

424
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,805
He asked me several questions,
most of which I answered.

425
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,440
Oh my God!

426
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:51,697
Well kids, you'll never guess
what I just found outside.

427
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:55,111
My button!

428
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:57,419
Things are looking up!

429
00:17:58,918 --> 00:18:00,634
I have something for you.

430
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:04,944
Oh, Alexis, you didn't have to do this.

431
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:06,040
Open it.

432
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:08,025
Oh, honey.

433
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,532
"My deepest condolences?"

434
00:18:17,103 --> 00:18:19,171
"I know things have been tough lately,

435
00:18:19,205 --> 00:18:23,736
but I'm here for you,
and hope this helps.

436
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:26,096
Love, Alexis."

437
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,827
Was there supposed to
be something in here?

438
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:36,415
In where?

439
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:39,197
In the card?

440
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,650
What do you mean?

441
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,986
Oh, it's just the card.

442
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:45,797
Yeah, I thought you
could use some support.

443
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:48,233
- So...
- Ohhh!

444
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:50,384
Wow!

445
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,604
That was really beautiful.

446
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:55,056
And very generous.

447
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:57,978
- Thank you.
- Both my kids are generous.

448
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:00,517
And I'm one very grateful dad.

449
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:03,715
Very grateful.

450
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,892
Awww!

451
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:07,552
Bring it in, big guy.

452
00:19:07,587 --> 00:19:09,421
Yeah, I don't know if that's
something I wanna do right now.

453
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:11,256
David, Dad's poor right now!

454
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,624
He's not poor anymore!

455
00:19:12,658 --> 00:19:14,860
Because someone gave him
more than a cheap card!

456
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:18,196
- Okay, okay, that's enough.
- Okay. Oh.

457
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,752
What's-what's this about?

458
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:25,650
I was just uh... hugging my kids.

459
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:27,251
Why?

460
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:31,143
- I found my button.
- Alexis got a job.

461
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:32,611
- Alexis got a job!
- Yeah.

462
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:36,181
- Alexis? Oh, how wonderful!
- Yeah!

463
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:38,850
Wow Alexis, look at you!

464
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:42,431
Just starting out on a shiny new future!

465
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:49,194
Whew! Okay, good night, kids.

466
00:19:49,228 --> 00:19:50,595
I'm gonna get changed.

467
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,954
Okay, sure.

468
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:58,391
You know, all things considered Moira

469
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,917
I'd say we have a... couple
of pretty great kids.

470
00:20:00,952 --> 00:20:02,556
Mhmm.

471
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:04,897
They say it's through our
children that we stay young.

472
00:20:04,922 --> 00:20:07,400
But I haven't seen much
effort on their part.

473
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:11,795
You're still thinking
about those photos.

474
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:13,497
Oh, I can't help it, John.

475
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:15,999
The last traces of my
juvenescence vanished

476
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:17,401
into thin air.

477
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:21,071
Well, perhaps they're
not the last traces.

478
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:24,017
What does that mean?

479
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,255
Why don't you look in my folio?

480
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:34,088
Inside pocket.

481
00:20:37,532 --> 00:20:39,478
Oh, you dirty dog!

482
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:41,892
Well, what can I say?

483
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:43,829
When did you take this?

484
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:46,782
Greece, 1987.

485
00:20:47,184 --> 00:20:49,853
Oh, I loved those earrings.

486
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:52,089
And that skin.

487
00:20:52,437 --> 00:20:53,829
And that hair.

488
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,106
I'm no Avedon honey,

489
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,923
but I would say you still
look pretty spectacular.

490
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,025
And that's all that counts.

491
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:13,156
Now how do I get this
on the Internet? John!

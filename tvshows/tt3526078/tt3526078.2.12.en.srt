1
00:00:02,648 --> 00:00:04,560
- John!
- Oh, I was starting to think...

2
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:05,816
I've been hijacked.

3
00:00:06,054 --> 00:00:09,234
- What?
- My campaign has been hijacked.

4
00:00:09,988 --> 00:00:12,334
Oh, I need some tea. Twyla?

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,312
What's going on?

6
00:00:13,337 --> 00:00:15,605
- Tea?
- No thank you.

7
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:19,007
Ugh! My campaign signs
have gone missing.

8
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:20,934
- What?
- You had election signs?

9
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:23,593
- Yes! All of them! Gone!
- Wow.

10
00:00:23,742 --> 00:00:25,523
Maybe people were mowing their lawns.

11
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:27,445
Well, it's probably just kids.

12
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:30,031
What if there's a more
sinister explanation?

13
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:32,898
Oh, like the wind.

14
00:00:33,418 --> 00:00:35,458
I was wondering if there's
someone who's thinking,

15
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:38,089
"Oh, this woman may not have many signs,

16
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:41,292
but she has myriad
qualities worth voting for.

17
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:42,867
I must stop her!"

18
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:46,063
So you think the signs were stolen?

19
00:00:46,098 --> 00:00:48,085
Stolen? Ew!

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,801
Is that what you think happened?

21
00:00:49,835 --> 00:00:51,836
Well, isn't that what you were implying?

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,338
- Who would do that?
- Well, I don't know. It's dirty pool.

23
00:00:54,373 --> 00:00:56,407
You can't sabotage someone's campaign

24
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:57,809
and take their signs.

25
00:00:57,843 --> 00:00:59,937
Please, please, everyone calm down!

26
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:03,681
Well, I suppose if there's
a silver lining in all this,

27
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:04,820
it's that...

28
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:07,952
Someone is imitated enough into thinking

29
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:10,221
that I might be affecting this town's

30
00:01:10,255 --> 00:01:12,789
long-established voting patterns.

32
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,447
Oh good. Good.

33
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:38,449
Now the playing field is more fair.

34
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:41,452
Yeah, I was worried Jocelyn
didn't have enough signs up.

35
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:43,521
Ah. You and me both, pal,

36
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:45,853
but, luckily, I'm a step ahead of ya.

37
00:01:46,225 --> 00:01:48,359
Okay, enough with the signs, Roland.

38
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:49,760
It was overkill a week ago.

39
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:51,235
Well, I don't know about you, Johnny,

40
00:01:51,263 --> 00:01:54,658
but I would like my little
lady to win this campaign.

41
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:56,634
Oh! Well, funny you should mention,

42
00:01:56,668 --> 00:02:00,791
because my little lady had all
of her lawn signs disappear.

43
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:03,074
Oh. Moira had lawn signs?

44
00:02:03,108 --> 00:02:04,502
She had a few.

45
00:02:04,977 --> 00:02:06,424
Now she has none.

46
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:09,881
Wait. Are you saying
that I... had something...

47
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:11,782
- I'm not pointing any fingers,
- Uh-huh.

48
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:13,918
But if I find out you had
anything to do with this,

49
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:15,553
even though you're
acting like you don't...

50
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:18,322
Well, if I find out
that you're accusing me

51
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:19,857
of doing something I didn't do,

52
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:22,260
then I'm going to accuse you
of making false accusations.

53
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:25,196
Fine. But if you're
denying doing something

54
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,731
you might have done

55
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:29,080
and making me feel guilty...

56
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:33,537
For accusing you of something
you claim you didn't do...

57
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:35,916
Ooh, is that a threat?

58
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:37,400
I think so.

59
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:41,190
Because I don't wanna tell
you how I respond to threats.

60
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:44,081
And I don't wanna tell you how I respond

61
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:46,517
to illegal political activity.

62
00:02:46,852 --> 00:02:48,319
Okay, fine, then don't.

63
00:02:48,353 --> 00:02:50,174
Fine, I won't.

64
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:53,697
Maybe.

65
00:02:56,762 --> 00:02:59,932
Oh dear God. Yes.

66
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,333
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.

67
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:05,057
Well then, take it out
of my savings account.

68
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:08,260
Well, what about the air miles?

69
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:11,342
Can you put some of them
towards the electricity bill?

70
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:14,705
Okay, this signage,
is not really on brand.

71
00:03:15,147 --> 00:03:17,081
It's not ridiculous.

72
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:19,617
Well, I'm not having
this conversation either.

73
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:22,053
Is everything okay?

74
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:25,674
David, to be honest,

75
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,426
I'm having a little trouble financially

76
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,377
and I'm gonna have to let you go.

77
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:33,431
- What?
- It seems I have overshot my budget

78
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:36,400
with the changes you've
been implementing.

79
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:38,658
Which is not your fault.

80
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:43,299
You were my mistake, which
I take full credit for.

81
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:45,843
Okay, I thought you were liking

82
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:47,244
the changes I was making.

83
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,113
We just sold another poncho yesterday.

84
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:51,882
I still can't believe we even sold one.

85
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:55,252
But that's not gonna help me
when I am down to a Costco card

86
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:56,807
and a zoo membership.

87
00:03:57,222 --> 00:03:59,223
Okay. Well, is there anything I can do?

88
00:03:59,257 --> 00:04:01,244
No, you've done enough already.

89
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:05,329
Fortunately, I did
gotten some good news.

90
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:09,100
Apparently there is a
Blouse Barn in Australia

91
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:14,533
and they are gonna pay
me to use their name here.

92
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:16,207
Can you believe it?

93
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,867
That there's another store
called Blouse Barn? No.

94
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,158
No, it's an entire chain.

95
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:23,647
They're expanding into North America

96
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:26,450
and they are gonna pay me $10,000

97
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:29,283
just to cover the costs
of renaming the store.

98
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:32,890
Okay, so they're buying
the name from you?

99
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:34,992
Well, it's more of a gesture actually.

100
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:38,892
Apparently, I have been using
the name without their permission.

101
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:42,633
Okay, so this company is giving
you $10,000 as a gesture...

102
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:45,569
And to think I almost called
this place "Blouse House."

103
00:04:45,604 --> 00:04:47,471
Something seems really
sketchy about this

104
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:48,873
and I'm not just saying that

105
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:50,744
because I have a hard
time with Australians.

106
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:52,977
- Lotta drunks.
- Well, it's already happening.

107
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:54,412
They're coming in this week,

108
00:04:54,446 --> 00:04:55,947
they're bringing the paperwork...

109
00:04:56,481 --> 00:04:57,882
As your brand manager,

110
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,885
I feel like I need
to be at that meeting.

111
00:05:00,052 --> 00:05:01,330
I don't know...

112
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:03,807
At least let me talk to a
few people before you decide.

113
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:05,423
If there's one thing I've
learned from "The Good Wife",

114
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:07,260
it's never accept a first offer.

115
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,885
- I... I'm gonna just... do that.
- Oh.

116
00:05:17,335 --> 00:05:20,304
- I have a question.
- Yes, your cologne is too strong.

117
00:05:20,338 --> 00:05:22,940
Okay, I just put it on

118
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:25,209
and it needs to breathe a bit, so...

119
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:28,045
I... came in here to ask

120
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,088
whether you knew anything
about trademarking store names?

121
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:34,752
Yeah. We had to deal with that

122
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:36,921
from time to time at Rose Video.

123
00:05:36,955 --> 00:05:43,236
Uh-huh. And did anyone ever
ask you to stop using the name?

124
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:46,163
No, but we went after
other people for using it.

125
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:49,900
I remember a-a "Rosie's Video"
in Sao Paolo.

126
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:51,602
That was a fun shakedown.

127
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,005
Mm-hmm. Okay, well, say
you owned Blouse Barn.

128
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,441
Well, first of all, I'd never
get into the clothing business

129
00:05:57,476 --> 00:05:59,076
'cause the margins are terrible...

130
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:00,678
Okay, let's pretend for a sec.

131
00:06:00,712 --> 00:06:05,015
And someone was offering you
$10,000 to stop using the name

132
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,685
because there's another
Blouse Barn in Australia

133
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:09,453
and they need the name.

134
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:13,057
$10,000 to stop using
the name "Blouse Barn?"

135
00:06:13,091 --> 00:06:14,825
- That's correct.
- I would take that in a second.

136
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,117
It's a terrible name.

137
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,162
- Okay, but that's not...
- Now at least with "Rose Video,"

138
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:19,763
it said what it was,

139
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:21,930
and the logo looked
great on a golf shirt.

140
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,201
Yeah, I'm just thinking
if it's a big chain

141
00:06:24,236 --> 00:06:25,734
and they want the name,

142
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:29,006
surely you should be
able to get more for it.

143
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,175
Yeah, but is worth going
to court to fight it?

144
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:32,977
Oh, I don't think Wendy can afford that.

145
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:34,712
She can't even afford me anymore, so...

146
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:36,617
Wait a minute. You were fired?

147
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,183
Technically, I would say

148
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:41,919
I'm in a transition phase at the moment.

149
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:43,420
This is terrible news.

150
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,523
I thought you were
turning that store around.

151
00:06:45,557 --> 00:06:47,825
All those big purchases,
all that spending...

152
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:49,827
Okay, let's just focus
on the big picture,

153
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:52,016
which is helping the store.

154
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,797
Well, if you wanna help the store,

155
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:55,906
I would tell your boss to take the deal.

156
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:58,836
And then you and I are gonna
sit down, update your resume,

157
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,771
and get you back into the workforce.

158
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:02,806
Okay. Well, thank you so much for this.

159
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:06,969
Um, it was entirely unhelpful,
but thank you nevertheless.

160
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:10,181
Well... anytime, son.

161
00:07:11,492 --> 00:07:14,133
Oh, it's just so violating.

162
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:17,488
How can one sleep knowing our
streets are laden with thieves?

163
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:19,123
Well, I don't know about laden.

164
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:21,759
I had a newspaper stolen once.

165
00:07:21,793 --> 00:07:24,211
Two days ago, we had
someone break our window.

166
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:25,829
They didn't take anything,

167
00:07:25,864 --> 00:07:27,831
but they left a dead bird inside.

168
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:29,289
That's kind of like my aunt.

169
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:32,570
She has a ghost in her house that
keeps leaving dimes everywhere.

170
00:07:32,604 --> 00:07:34,016
Look what's happened to us.

171
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:37,914
These sign bandits have clearly
created a culture of fear.

172
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:39,843
If it helps at all, I'd be happy

173
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:41,579
to put one of your signs on my lawn.

174
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:43,734
Th-that is if Jocelyn doesn't mind.

175
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:46,784
Oh no, I'd put one on my lawn

176
00:07:46,818 --> 00:07:48,552
if I wasn't worried about winning.

177
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:52,723
I hope you know that I don't
stand for dirty politics, Moira.

178
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:54,658
Oh no, you mustn't beat yourself up.

179
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:56,794
You have your own signs to worry about.

180
00:07:56,828 --> 00:07:58,484
All two hundred of them.

181
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:05,669
Well... we're here to sing,
aren't we? So... let's sing!

182
00:08:05,704 --> 00:08:08,072
Well said! Let us
focus on tomorrow's show

183
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:10,374
and not fan the flames of
this provocative scandal

184
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:11,775
any more than is necessary.

185
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,953
Sing ladies... if you can.

186
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,648
Let's do this.

187
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:20,750
Hey.

188
00:08:21,353 --> 00:08:23,387
What're you shopping for?

189
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:24,822
I'm not shopping.

190
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:26,890
Okay, well, I'm seeing
a lot of women's tops,

191
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:28,726
so if there's a minimum
amount for free shipping

192
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,194
can let me know before you order?

193
00:08:30,228 --> 00:08:32,596
Okay, yeah, no, I'm... I'm
actually doing work, so.

194
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:35,032
Mm... Dad said that you got fired.

195
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,445
I wasn't fired.

196
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:39,937
I'm... actually working so
that I can stay employed.

197
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:41,538
I have a big meeting with some lawyers

198
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:42,906
and I'm trying to make sure

199
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:44,570
they're not taking advantage of Wendy.

200
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:46,310
Poor thing is a hot mess.

201
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:49,213
Okay, I just really think you
should stay out of it, David.

202
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:50,625
You're not good under pressure.

203
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,417
- And you are?
- Um, I'm sorry. Were you picked up

204
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,930
by the South Korean Secret
Police on New Year's?

205
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:57,988
I had to sweet talk
the consulate's lawyer

206
00:08:58,023 --> 00:09:00,141
to get me a passport before midnight.

207
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:03,694
Okay, well this is a very
different situation from that

208
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:05,758
and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be fine.

209
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:11,735
Did you or did you not have 
a subscription to Cosmo Girl

210
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,859
when you were 16 years old, David?

211
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:18,211
No.

212
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:19,910
Okay, David, if you have
to lie about something

213
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:21,478
you should breathe out while you answer

214
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:23,247
'cause it really just calms you down.

215
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:25,816
Oh my God! I'm not being interrogated.

216
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,217
This is a negotiation.

217
00:09:27,252 --> 00:09:29,186
I'm just trying to prepare you, okay?

218
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,422
'Cause they're gonna
eat you alive in there.

219
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:34,591
Okay. If you know so much about this,

220
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:36,476
why don't you come with me then?

221
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:38,595
Okay, well, I guess that just depends

222
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,148
on what's in Mom's closet.

223
00:09:40,432 --> 00:09:41,832
Why does that matter?

224
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:43,200
Well, I'm not gonna wear my own clothes

225
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,868
into the room, David.

226
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:46,945
They're not scary enough.

227
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:58,219
I know that we just met but if
Prince Harry trusted me with his life,

228
00:09:58,253 --> 00:09:59,821
then I think you can too.

229
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,778
Well, I do feel better
having a lawyer in the room.

230
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:05,448
Oh my God, you're so cute.

231
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:06,648
Um, I'm not a lawyer,

232
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,951
but I'm glad that my
fashion pony is working.

233
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,824
Oh, hi. I'm Wendy Kurtz.
Welcome to the Blouse Barn.

234
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:16,592
Lisa Chung.

235
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:18,527
I didn't realize there
were gonna be more of us.

236
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:19,953
We're her representation.

237
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,008
David Rose.

238
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:25,336
Angelica Bloomfield of Rose,
Bloomfield and Glickman.

239
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:29,325
Well, let's go to my office shall we?

240
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:34,043
- Oh, Mr. Rose!
- Oh, hi Stevie.

241
00:10:34,077 --> 00:10:36,766
I found these. I thought
Mrs. Rose might want 'em back.

242
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:39,008
You found them?

243
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:43,304
Okay, look, I know we haven't
always been ideal motel guests,

244
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:46,331
but taking my wife's signs?

245
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:49,892
Ah, no, I took out your garbage,

246
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:52,625
and these poked a hole in
the bottom and fell out.

247
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:55,237
So... they're still
in pretty good shape,

248
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:57,421
I thought she might want them back.

249
00:10:58,034 --> 00:10:59,535
Oh...

250
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:01,904
Since she's been so
worried about her signs

251
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:03,945
having been mysteriously stolen.

252
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,437
Right, right.

253
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:09,821
Well, I mean, I can see
what must have happened here.

254
00:11:09,846 --> 00:11:13,359
She accidentally, uh, threw them out.

255
00:11:14,317 --> 00:11:15,930
That's one theory.

256
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:22,634
Or... someone stole them
and hid them in our garbage

257
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:25,514
to try and sabotage Moira...

258
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:30,008
to make it look like she's
done something... really crazy.

259
00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:33,245
That is definitely
some food for thought.

260
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,747
- Yeah.
- Mm.

261
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:38,708
Well, thank you,
Stevie. Have a nice day.

262
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,934
Thanks. I will.

263
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:46,817
This shouldn't take long. The check.

264
00:11:47,017 --> 00:11:51,053
This should cover the cost of
the signs, business cards...

265
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:53,889
About the check.

266
00:11:53,924 --> 00:11:57,560
We had some questions about the amount.

267
00:11:57,594 --> 00:11:58,687
Well, you shouldn't.

268
00:11:58,712 --> 00:12:01,681
$10,000 is the amount we agreed upon.

269
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:03,732
Well, that may be,

270
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:06,235
but some things have
changed on our side,

271
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,504
and we want to discuss the...

272
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:10,272
I think it's fine, David.

273
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:11,674
From a legal standpoint,

274
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,859
there are lots of costs to consider.

275
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:17,844
- Mm-hmm. - There are the
signs and the business cards...

276
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:19,185
I just mentioned those.

277
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:21,947
Objection sustained.

278
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:24,787
There is the travel,
there are the meals,

279
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:27,756
there is the shipping
and the catering...

280
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,191
Which is very similar to the meals

281
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:31,375
and not necessarily relevant, so...

282
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:35,250
'Kay. Well, the $10,000 doesn't
even cover our legal fees, so...

283
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:37,709
- What?
- Don't worry about that.

284
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:39,328
And if we're gonna announce a new name,

285
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:41,470
there has to be a whole relaunch event,

286
00:12:41,505 --> 00:12:44,273
and that involves... Event planners

287
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:46,075
and, um, florists.

288
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:48,911
Okay, I think what my
colleague is trying to say,

289
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:52,437
is that our brand is very
well established here,

290
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:57,234
um, so we're going to
require a higher compensation.

291
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:04,693
No, it's... ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh. Ooh...

292
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:07,211
No! No, no, Gwen, you
took the lower third.

293
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:10,203
Well, could you please then?
I've already locked mine in.

294
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,468
Thanks, doll.

295
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:16,972
Moira, do you have any idea

296
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:20,643
how Stevie found your
campaign signs in our garbage?

297
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:22,992
I don't think anyone can hear us, John.

298
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:24,984
You don't have to keep up the act.

299
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:28,328
- What act?
- That you didn't know I took the signs.

300
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:30,119
You took your signs?

301
00:13:30,153 --> 00:13:31,487
I didn't know you took the signs.

302
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:33,222
Why would you take your own signs?

303
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:34,657
Well, I couldn't very
well take Jocelyn's.

304
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:36,158
That would be stealing

305
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:37,993
and I'm running a clean campaign.

306
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:40,129
You call this a clean campaign?

307
00:13:40,163 --> 00:13:41,931
Politics 101, John.

308
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:43,766
When you have limited resources,

309
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,398
your best course of
action is to create a stir.

310
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:48,504
It's exciting, it's fun.

311
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:50,039
It's like that episode of Sunrise Bay

312
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:51,740
when I stole my own baby.

313
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:54,643
Moira, Sunrise Bay was a soap opera.

314
00:13:54,678 --> 00:13:56,500
Yes, and this is reality.

315
00:13:56,913 --> 00:13:59,351
Frankly, John, I'm
surprised at your naivety.

316
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:01,726
Moira, you're misleading people!

317
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:03,886
No, I'm building a mystery.

318
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,188
Voters will draw their own conclusions.

319
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:08,694
I basically accused Roland

320
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:11,360
of stealing your campaign signs.

321
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:13,359
Well, then hopefully
you've learned something -

322
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:16,053
you shouldn't make accusations
you can't substantiate.

323
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:18,375
- Moira...
- I'm not listening until you calm down.

324
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:29,144
Okay, well, Blouse Barn Australia

325
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:32,314
is willing to offer you
an additional $5,000.

326
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:34,016
- Oh my God.
- Thank you.

327
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,851
So if you'll just sign
here, I think we're good.

328
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:39,109
I don't think we are.

329
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,767
I have done some research
and I happen to know

330
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:46,320
that your company pulled
in $100 million last year.

331
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:47,781
Point being?

332
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:51,300
Well, the point is, judging
by your bag and those shoes,

333
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:52,668
Blouse Barn Australia is paying you

334
00:14:52,702 --> 00:14:54,169
quite a bit of money to come here

335
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:57,305
and help us "switch over our signs."

336
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,533
Bottom line, we're standing in your way

337
00:15:00,677 --> 00:15:03,646
and I don't think your
client will be very happy

338
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,781
if you come home without
securing the rights to the name,

339
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:07,383
especially considering you're expanding

340
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,551
into 78 stores across North America.

341
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:10,986
And let's be honest,

342
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:14,375
"Blouse House" doesn't have
quite the same ring to it.

343
00:15:14,924 --> 00:15:17,445
- Exactly!
- Angelica, please.

344
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:20,875
This is the number that we are after.

345
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:28,337
Now, if you'll excuse us,

346
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:29,938
we have another meeting to get to.

347
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:31,234
We're in our store.

348
00:15:31,415 --> 00:15:33,082
We await your reply.

349
00:15:39,109 --> 00:15:42,360
Moira, I felt bad about
what happened to your signs

350
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:46,156
and so I had some of my
students make these for you.

351
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:48,991
Jocelyn!

352
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:51,360
They're not as nice as the
black and white ones you had,

353
00:15:51,394 --> 00:15:53,133
but I thought that they might help.

354
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:54,836
Very considerate.

355
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:58,906
Though there's something you
and I still need to discuss.

356
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:00,883
The signs.

357
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:05,207
We both know that, in a heated campaign,

358
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:07,543
one might use whatever resources one has

359
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:10,211
- to gain advantage.
- Yes.

360
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:14,297
Jocelyn, you have so many signs!

361
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,085
I know. Roland got carried away

362
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:17,519
and used his mayoral power

363
00:16:17,554 --> 00:16:19,547
to get people to put
more signs on their lawns.

364
00:16:19,923 --> 00:16:22,961
And I just... pretended
it wasn't happening.

365
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:26,577
Roland forced constituents

366
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:28,633
to put up signs through coercion?

367
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:30,512
That's what we're talking about, right?

368
00:16:30,537 --> 00:16:31,904
Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, yeah.

369
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:34,797
I just was helping
you explain, so you...

370
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:36,572
Because you seem so upset by it all.

371
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:38,231
I am upset.

372
00:16:38,274 --> 00:16:40,867
I don't like what this
campaign is doing to me.

373
00:16:41,111 --> 00:16:45,013
The other day, I called
another driver an effing moron.

374
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:47,750
I didn't say the 'f' word,
but I said, 'effing, '

375
00:16:48,017 --> 00:16:49,617
and that is not me!

376
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:52,650
Jocelyn, I don't think
it's exactly unethical

377
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:55,777
to do questionable things
in the spirit of competition.

378
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,062
I'm dropping out of the campaign.

379
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,378
- What?
- I'm barely sleeping,

380
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,030
I can't get through an episode

381
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:04,273
of "Masterchef Junior" without crying.

382
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:06,639
We've both worked so hard for this.

383
00:17:06,664 --> 00:17:11,086
I know, and now I am giving it to you.

384
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:15,234
Congratulations, Moira.

385
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:18,528
You are the new councilor for
the town of Schitt's Creek.

386
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,131
David, come on in!

387
00:17:24,156 --> 00:17:25,957
Here, have a seat.

388
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,672
Lisa got back to me.
She dropped off a check.

389
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:35,672
It's a big check, David.

390
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:36,914
Oh, thank God!

391
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:39,568
It's a bit check!

392
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:40,961
Oh...

393
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:44,473
Um, you don't mean one of those
big lottery checks, right?

394
00:17:44,507 --> 00:17:45,874
- No.
- Okay.

395
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:48,141
But you pulled it off!

396
00:17:48,807 --> 00:17:51,042
Um, thank you for trusting me.

397
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:52,945
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

398
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,675
Okay. Um... I guess we
should get back to work.

399
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,734
I love your enthusiasm,

400
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:01,690
but I think I'm going to take some time

401
00:18:01,724 --> 00:18:04,312
for my family, for me,

402
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:06,125
and close the store.

403
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,797
Oh, okay.

404
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:11,906
But I appreciate all you've done,

405
00:18:12,442 --> 00:18:17,469
and I want you to have
this, you and Alexis.

406
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:19,195
Well, Alexis didn't do that much.

407
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,766
Oh, oh my God.

408
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,367
And I hope this helps
get you on your feet.

409
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:28,484
And do something
interesting. You always do.

410
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:32,859
I... can't accept this.

411
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:42,461
- Moira!
- John.

412
00:18:46,135 --> 00:18:48,875
I'm so excited to see the show.

413
00:18:48,948 --> 00:18:50,476
I'm going to be on council.

414
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,461
We'll, that's the
spirit. Positive thinking.

415
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,781
I won! Jocelyn quit the election.

416
00:18:57,376 --> 00:18:58,810
What?

417
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:00,670
She couldn't take it anymore.

418
00:19:00,695 --> 00:19:03,163
Well, think what you
can do in four years.

419
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:06,024
Four years? No, no one said
anything about four years.

420
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:08,833
And-and the thought of
working with Roland every day.

421
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:09,930
I mean, that's...

422
00:19:09,955 --> 00:19:11,226
I wouldn't even think about that.

423
00:19:14,004 --> 00:19:17,656
Oh, John. What have I done?

424
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:25,107
- ♪ 'Cuz tonight for the first time ♪
- ♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah ♪

425
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:26,508
- ♪ Just about half past ten ♪
- ♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah ♪

426
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,077
- ♪ For the first time in history
- ♪ Ahhhh ♪

427
00:19:29,112 --> 00:19:33,281
- ♪ it's gonna be raining men ♪
- ♪ dada-da-da-da-da-da-da bop! ♪

428
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:37,820
So...

429
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:42,417
$40,000?!

430
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:44,039
Oh, that's a lot of money.

431
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:47,034
Wow! Even divided
amongst the four of us.

432
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:51,242
Divided? I'm the one who
negotiated all of this.

433
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,068
Um, with my help, David.

434
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:56,187
I believe I offered advice.

435
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:59,881
You said Wendy should cave
and take the first offer.

436
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:03,008
What you gave was the
opposite of advice.

437
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,001
Okay, stop. This is good.

438
00:20:05,026 --> 00:20:08,195
This is the first real
money we've seen in a year.

439
00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:11,516
'Kay, I think we definitely
need to celebrate.

440
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,709
Nothing big, just a little treat...

441
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:16,305
Like a trip.

442
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:20,698
Okay. I can't believe that
I'm the one to say this,

443
00:20:20,723 --> 00:20:24,766
but um... shouldn't we be s...

444
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:29,247
Shouldn't we
be s-s-s...

445
00:20:29,272 --> 00:20:35,513
Should we be... Trying
to sa... save this?

446
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:36,872
Isn't... Shouldn't we be saving...

447
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:39,207
Putting this in a bank?

448
00:20:39,242 --> 00:20:41,409
Isn't that what people do?

449
00:20:44,018 --> 00:20:45,805
Well, that's no fun.

450
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:50,726
No... but probably best?

451
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:55,614
Maybe we could do manicures.

452
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:57,407
I could a manicure. The
three of us should go.

453
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:59,299
- Yes!
- Long overdue.

454
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,258
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Yay!

455
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:03,351
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Just 'cause I do my own nails

456
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:04,743
doesn't mean, you know, I wouldn't go...

457
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:06,135
'Kay, they're just expensive

458
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,527
and you wouldn't really appreciate them.

459
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:09,695
Oh yay, David! Yay!

460
00:21:16,054 --> 00:21:20,949

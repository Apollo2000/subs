1
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:08,757
Is today the baseball day?

2
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:11,062
Today was supposed to
be the baseball day, yes.

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,261
- The finale?
- Championship.

4
00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:14,286
Same thing.

5
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,704
What time did you need me to show up

6
00:00:15,706 --> 00:00:17,451
to watch you play the baseball?

7
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:19,418
Well, as of right now, there
you might not be anything

8
00:00:19,443 --> 00:00:21,443
- for you to watch.
- Oh?

9
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:22,878
Gwen dropped out.

10
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:24,089
Apparently she has to go see

11
00:00:24,114 --> 00:00:26,425
a friend she met on the internet, so...

12
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,160
we are missing a right fielder.

13
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:29,962
Can you play both parts?

14
00:00:30,187 --> 00:00:32,662
Positions. And, no.
That's the whole problem.

15
00:00:32,687 --> 00:00:34,189
We will forfeit the game

16
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:35,944
if we can't come up with a ninth player.

17
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,971
Well on the upside, there
is an Isabelle Huppert

18
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:41,330
double feature playing
at the Elmdale Art House.

19
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:42,642
David, I can't bail on the game,

20
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,233
I just have to find a ninth player.

21
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:47,013
Okay, well, good luck. It
sounds a bit last minute.

22
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:49,006
You know, they don't
even have to do anything,

23
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:50,806
they pretty much just stand there.

24
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:52,451
Have you asked Ronnie?

25
00:00:52,476 --> 00:00:54,607
Uh, she is on the other team,

26
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:56,490
and I'm pretty sure she hates me

27
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,480
after the bathroom incident.

28
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,058
Oh, I forgot about that.

29
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,194
Hey, you know what, David,
since you were already

30
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,418
planning on being
there, maybe-maybe you...

31
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,753
Absolutely not!

32
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:06,734
- Just two hours of your life.
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

33
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:08,765
- We just need a body!
- Then go to the morgue.

34
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,369
I will cover you if
any flies come your way.

35
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:11,559
I have a spray for that.

36
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:13,095
And you know my stance on team sports.

37
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:15,007
I do. Given today's political climate,

38
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:16,610
we don't need to divide
ourselves any more

39
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:18,100
- than we already have.
- Correct.

40
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:21,342
Have I mentioned to you
that there will be a...

41
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:22,890
barbecue after?

42
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,385
I have a couple questions.

43
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,355
How many of the questions
are about the barbecue?

44
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,577
Most of them.

45
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:32,058
Like, how soon after
the game is the barbecue,

46
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,460
and will the players get to eat first,

47
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:35,784
and if so, who's enforcing that rule?

48
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,496
- I love you, David.
- Okay. I...

49
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:40,589
- you say that now, but...
- Mm... muah!

50
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:42,057
I don't do well with running.

51
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:43,725
All right.

52
00:01:43,727 --> 00:01:48,263
-- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe --

53
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:51,623
Ronnie, I don't know
what the big deal is!

54
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:54,148
Nobody's gonna even notice
that Stevie's not at the game.

55
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,883
That's not the problem, Roland.

56
00:01:55,952 --> 00:01:57,596
I gotta be honest, sometimes
I don't even notice her

57
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,286
when she's standing
right in front of me.

58
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:01,154
Roland, the rules say that we can't play

59
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,867
if we don't have nine players!

60
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:05,892
And I can't stomach the
thought of Patrick's team

61
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:08,318
winning by default; the
man looks like a thumb!

62
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:10,275
Ooh, Ronnie!

63
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,167
I'm gonna need you to pour a
little of that picante sauce

64
00:02:13,192 --> 00:02:14,625
on the game today.

65
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,171
Because my bookie,
Lorenzo, gave me great odds

66
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:18,468
on us taking this.

67
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:20,051
There is not going to be a game

68
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:22,643
- if we don't have a full team!
- Um, excuse me?

69
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:24,845
I used to play a little ball in my day.

70
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:28,500
I was the star left
fielder from my school team.

71
00:02:28,787 --> 00:02:30,453
You played college ball?

72
00:02:30,478 --> 00:02:31,963
No, Hebrew school.

73
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:34,054
There were seven of us, surprisingly,

74
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,923
not a big turn-out, but uh,

75
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,392
the Flying Latkes ended
up in fourth place.

76
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:40,771
Johnny, I think some things have changed

77
00:02:40,796 --> 00:02:43,264
since played ball, okay?

78
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,499
For one thing, the war is over. Ohhh!

79
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:47,212
Well, excuse me, I
thought you were in a bind,

80
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:49,469
and needed a player, but uh,

81
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:51,271
forget it, I'm taking my offer back.

82
00:02:51,307 --> 00:02:53,340
Roland, he's our only option.

83
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:54,542
No, he's not!

84
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:56,677
Joce has a CPR dummy
that we can just throw

85
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:58,569
- out into left field.
- Roland!

86
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:00,976
- We're going with Johnny!
- Ah, boy.

87
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:03,150
Great! And just so you know,

88
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:05,419
I had a pretty strong
arm in the outfield.

89
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:07,570
The Rabbi used to call me "Popeye".

90
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:13,738
Okay... I am gonna give Lorenzo a call,

91
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:15,295
and change my bet.

92
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:17,843
I'm gonna put everything
I got on the other team.

93
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:22,210
Hi Honey, is your Daddy home?

94
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:27,274
This is so exciting!

95
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:29,431
I've never been in a musical before.

96
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:32,246
Although I did have a cousin
who was in "Riverdance"

97
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,003
until she got trampled.

98
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:36,795
Yeah, um, I was one of the
original Pussycat Dolls,

99
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,229
But I only lasted like, two weeks.

100
00:03:38,254 --> 00:03:40,859
Because apparently, I'm "too pretty".

101
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:43,858
This is gonna be such a fun day!

102
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,259
Hey, Twyla!

103
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:47,595
What about you, Stevie?

104
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,875
I didn't even know that
you wanted to be an actor.

105
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,671
- I don't.
- Fine, "artist".

106
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:56,070
I've been dreading this rehearsal

107
00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:57,627
for the past two days.

108
00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:59,440
Okay, as star of the show,

109
00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:02,132
you might wanna set like, a
different tone for everyone.

110
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:04,375
I think this is a huge mistake.

111
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:06,113
You're not wrong.

112
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:07,815
There has been a lot
of confusion as to why

113
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,884
I'm not the star of the
show, but fair is fair.

114
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:13,125
You earned it.
- No, I didn't.

115
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,016
I didn't audition.

116
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,755
I don't like attention.

117
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,604
I can't think of anything worse

118
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,496
than standing on a stage

119
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:24,454
in front of a room full of people.

120
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,451
Okay, Stevie, I think
you just need to chill.

121
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,069
If this is anything like my first day

122
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:30,460
with the Pussycat Dolls,

123
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:31,984
it'll be a couple of hours of Kegels,

124
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:34,164
and then an afternoon
of cheeky Bellinis.

125
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:36,188
It's just a lot of pressure.

126
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,689
Don't even worry about it.

127
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:39,364
I got your back today, girl.

128
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,423
Just like Nicole Scherzinger did for me.

129
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:44,084
Willkommen and bienvenue,

130
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:47,532
welcome, you... to "Cabaret!"

131
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:49,034
Not now, not yet.

132
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:50,824
Okay, mhmm.

133
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:52,849
I'm sure this will come
as a shock to all of you,

134
00:04:52,874 --> 00:04:57,164
but this production will
mark my directorial debut!

135
00:04:57,433 --> 00:04:59,033
Mmm...

136
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:03,037
Oh.

137
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,609
Missing cues already.

138
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:07,535
No, I'm-I'm simply here to inspire.

139
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,389
And instruct, and bring
out the very best in you.

140
00:05:11,414 --> 00:05:13,547
And I want to start the
day with my lupanarian

141
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:15,007
Kit Kat Girls!

142
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:18,118
We've also included anyone
who's requested extra

143
00:05:18,143 --> 00:05:21,145
rehearsal time to work
on their dance moves.

144
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,290
I just wanna limber up.

145
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:25,898
There's some pretty
tricky footwork, so...

146
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:29,584
First, everyone, please,
direct your gaze...

147
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,765
to the beating heart of our show,

148
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,957
our Sally Bowles, Miss Stevie...

149
00:05:34,982 --> 00:05:36,617
- Budd.
- Budd!

150
00:05:39,984 --> 00:05:43,421
You're wondering, are
we really going to lay

151
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:47,171
this colossal enterprise
upon her tiny shoulders?

152
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:49,516
Yes! I'm a 100% confident

153
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:51,719
that you will all soon see what I hope

154
00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:54,414
I believe I may be
seeing in you, Stevie.

155
00:05:55,052 --> 00:05:56,518
Thank you.

156
00:05:56,543 --> 00:05:58,992
As long as you're up, why
don't we jump right in?

157
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:01,017
You can help me lead the first exercise.

158
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:03,609
Uh, I thought this more of a
meet and greet kind of thing.

159
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:05,167
It's the afternoon upon which

160
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:07,326
your bodies will meet and greet...

161
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:08,950
the boards.

162
00:06:08,975 --> 00:06:11,041
Okay, this is called...

163
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:12,807
"Monster on my Back."

164
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:14,197
Oh, fuck.

166
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,451
Wow...

167
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:26,757
Okay, just so you're aware,

168
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,489
I had a very cute,

169
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,531
"my boyfriend's on the
baseball team" spectator look

170
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,956
prepared for today,

171
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:33,446
and now I'm wearing tap shoes.

172
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,539
They're called cleats, and
I think you look very cute.

173
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:37,563
That's a given.

174
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,132
This just isn't how I pictured

175
00:06:39,157 --> 00:06:41,375
being a placeholder rolling out.

176
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:44,882
Here. I thought we could head outside,

177
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:46,807
maybe throw the ball
around a little bit?

178
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:49,065
This glove is brown. My shoes are black.

179
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,856
What exactly are we doing here?

180
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:53,146
- We're gonna practice?
- Practice what?!

181
00:06:53,182 --> 00:06:55,182
You told me I was
just a body in a field!

182
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:56,817
- Hey, Patrick.
- Hey, Mr. Rose.

183
00:06:56,842 --> 00:06:58,108
- Whoa!
- What are you doing?!

184
00:06:58,287 --> 00:06:59,720
Well, what are you doing?

185
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:01,455
Patrick's forcing me to be on his team

186
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,013
- for the game today.
- Yeah.

187
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,636
Well, Roland and Ronnie
wanted me to be on their team

188
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:07,727
- for the game today.
- Oh my God!

189
00:07:07,763 --> 00:07:09,775
That's funny, 'cause Ronnie's
been telling me all week

190
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:11,732
how stacked her team is!

191
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:13,352
So yeah, so this makes sense.

192
00:07:13,377 --> 00:07:15,736
Oh. Well, David, I'm surprised to see

193
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,470
you back in a uniform.

194
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:19,194
Whoa, I'm sorry, "back" in a uniform?

195
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:20,684
Okay, we don't need to get into it.

196
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:21,907
He didn't tell you?

197
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:23,943
Well, David holds the
Little League record

198
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,812
for most times hit by a ball.

199
00:07:25,837 --> 00:07:27,904
That's assuming it wasn't intentional.

200
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:29,860
They let me go home early.

201
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:31,485
So... where are you putting him?

202
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,776
Right field.

203
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:34,466
Okay, well, I'll try and get everyone

204
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,244
to pull the ball to the left.

205
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:38,002
Well, thank you, Mr. Rose,

206
00:07:38,027 --> 00:07:39,467
but we're trying to keep morale high.

207
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,594
David and I are actually
just going outside

208
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:43,341
to throw the ball around.
Well, that sounds like fun.

209
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:45,710
I think I'll oil up
the glove and join you.

210
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:47,234
Ew! Please don't.

211
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,903
Oh David, don't worry, you'll be great.

212
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:53,188
I just wish I'd kept
that helmet I got you.

213
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:57,891
Does this come in black?

214
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:00,157
You can use mine.

215
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:02,494
Once...

216
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:03,777
Once.

217
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:06,930
Uh no, we've moved on
from the mirror exercise.

218
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:09,598
Oh, okay, sorry. Go ahead.

219
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:10,921
Once...

220
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:12,011
At the motel...

221
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:14,024
One word at a time.

222
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,118
Okay.

223
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:18,159
Once...

224
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,802
Uh sorry, I'm not good at this,

225
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:24,204
I'm just not good at this, so.

226
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,940
Okay, um, maybe someone else
should jump in at this point.

227
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:29,476
Excellent idea, Alexis.
Okay, I'll play with Stevie.

228
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:32,856
And perhaps we'll get a clearer
idea of what we need here.

229
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:34,526
Maybe you could do it
with somebody else though,

230
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,550
let somebody else try.
First word is a gimme.

231
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:38,511
So you may say "once."

232
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:41,292
- Once...
- Upon...

233
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:43,150
A...

234
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:45,625
- Nightmare...
- My...

235
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:47,094
- Captor...
- Was...

236
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:48,962
Dismembering...

237
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,321
Okay, does it always get so dark?

238
00:08:51,346 --> 00:08:54,347
Oh, I'm, I'm just flowing
with your energy, Stevie.

239
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:55,956
Which is good, but...

240
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:58,615
you may require a little scordatura.

241
00:08:58,774 --> 00:09:00,640
Why don't I break us up into groups.

242
00:09:00,642 --> 00:09:01,853
That's a good idea, 'cause it's better

243
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:03,911
than what's happening
here. I'm glad you agree.

244
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:07,433
- I'll... I'll number us off!
- Um, one, two.

245
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:11,308
One, two.

246
00:09:11,587 --> 00:09:13,019
Two.

247
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:15,531
Two... two, two.

248
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:18,792
Jocelyn, take group two
for some movement exercises.

249
00:09:18,828 --> 00:09:20,060
- Mhmm.
- Thank you.

250
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:22,429
And you and I will do a
little more one on one.

251
00:09:24,276 --> 00:09:25,576
Okay, hey!

252
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:27,634
Do you think we could maybe
switch parts at this point?

253
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:29,381
Um, at this point I
really wouldn't want to.

254
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:31,004
But if it makes you feel better,

255
00:09:31,006 --> 00:09:32,683
I think lunch is soon.

256
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:36,728
Um, I'm just wondering when
the Bellinis are coming out?

257
00:09:37,438 --> 00:09:39,104
Stay strong, babe.

258
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:42,291
Alexis, we don't need
to exercise our movement?

259
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,127
Come here.

260
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:54,145
- You ready?
- Uh, yeah.

261
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:58,475
Okay, next time, can you make sure

262
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,701
the ball goes into my
glove? Thanks so much.

263
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:03,660
It's a ground ball, David.
So in a game situation,

264
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:05,683
it is possible that
the ball won't be hit

265
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,486
directly into your glove.

266
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:10,297
How's it going, boys? Do
you mind if I toss a few?

267
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:11,689
That'd be great, Mr. Rose.
That way I

268
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:13,091
won't be the only
one chasing the ball

269
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:15,048
every time I miss David's glove.

270
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,917
Okay, the last thing I need right now

271
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:18,696
are two people coaching me on something

272
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:19,900
I didn't wanna do in the first place.

273
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:21,855
Well, it's more for me, David.

274
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:23,590
Popeye's arm isn't what it used to be.

275
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,349
Nobody's gonna call you Popeye.

276
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,706
Look alive, Patrick!

277
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:31,575
Whoa, hold it.

278
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,000
Uh, Johnny?

279
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:35,469
What are we doing here?

280
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:36,982
Just tossing the ball around, Roland.

281
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:39,873
- No big deal.
- Wait, David's your sub?

282
00:10:41,444 --> 00:10:44,311
I thought you told me
that your team was stacked!

283
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:46,402
- Good to see you too, Ronnie.
- Yeah...

284
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:47,892
Dave, be honest with me.

285
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:50,418
Are you just playing to
make your dad look good?

286
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:53,643
I may have to call
my bookie again, right?

287
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:56,502
Okay, this is passive harassment.

288
00:10:56,527 --> 00:10:58,558
Anyway, we just stopped
by to say we're having

289
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:00,894
a little pre-game bevvy
and pep talk at my place

290
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,762
if you want to join us, Johnny.

291
00:11:02,798 --> 00:11:04,142
Well, I think I'll just stick around,

292
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,181
and loosen up a bit, Ronnie.

293
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:08,079
Johnny, I don't think
it's really ethical for you

294
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:10,637
to be doing spring
training with the enemy.

295
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:13,173
He's not the enemy, Roland. He's my son.

296
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:16,338
There are no sons in baseball!

297
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:17,449
What?

298
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:19,958
I'd argue most baseball
players are somebody's son.

299
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:21,981
- So what does that make me?!
- Ohhhh!

300
00:11:22,017 --> 00:11:23,428
No but, just 'cause
he, he said there's...

301
00:11:23,452 --> 00:11:24,685
Yeah, you know what, good luck.

302
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:26,119
'Cause you all are gonna need it.

303
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,010
Yeah, I'm looking at you. Roland: Yeah.

304
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,974
Wow, she is really not a fan.

305
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:35,899
Ohh man, I wanna win this game.

306
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:38,108
Okay, you told me it
was just for fun, though!

307
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:39,799
Well, it is for fun, David,

308
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:42,335
but a little rivalry is part of the fun.

309
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,104
It's like when we used
to play the Catholic kids

310
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:46,345
from Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow.

311
00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:49,028
The worst school cheer I ever heard.

312
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:57,341
Blaaah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

313
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,533
Let's be aware!

314
00:11:59,558 --> 00:12:03,174
There are two groups in
the room, voices carry.

315
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,572
Okay.

316
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:07,348
But this is actually a
good distraction for you.

317
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:08,573
Because when you're on stage,

318
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:10,541
you're going to have
to drown it all out.

319
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:14,100
Okay, so let's now focus on the image

320
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,830
you were about to conjure for me.

321
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:18,501
Okay...

322
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:21,652
I'm in the Town Hall.

323
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,720
I'm wearing my maroon plaid hoodie.

324
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:27,164
And I'm feeling...

325
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:29,055
very uncomfortable.

326
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,012
Hmm, vivid.

327
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:33,470
Visceral. Excellent, Stevie.

328
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:36,489
Although the exercise
does ask us to recall

329
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:39,582
a traumatic event in our life.

330
00:12:39,995 --> 00:12:41,862
This sounds almost as
if you're describing

331
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,221
what's happening right now.

332
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:46,733
- Well, I am.
- Oop!

333
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:50,059
There's that razor sharp
wit that landed you the role.

334
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:53,050
Ah, Moira. Group two
is gonna take a fiver.

335
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,985
I have not had this much exercise

336
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,010
since I birthed Roland Jr.

337
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:58,408
Look at you, Jocelyn!

338
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:00,880
Pushing your authority
as assistant director

339
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:02,348
to its limit.

340
00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:05,419
But Stevie and I are still
doing some memory sculpting.

341
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:07,688
Uh, Mrs. Rose, I think
I could really use

342
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:10,046
- a five minute break.
- Oh, Stevie.

343
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:12,892
Okay, but we've chatted
30 seconds already,

344
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:15,762
so we'll call it a
company four-and-a-half.

345
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:17,163
Okay.

346
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:19,254
Okay...

347
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:23,970
- Hey.
- Hey.

348
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:25,772
So before I take my five,

349
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:28,375
which technically won't start
until after this conversation,

350
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,000
I just wanted to have
a conversation with you.

351
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:32,391
It's about Stevie.

352
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:36,184
Oh Alexis, I can't say
I didn't see this coming.

353
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:37,975
This must be very difficult for you,

354
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,520
watching one of your
contemporaries step in

355
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:43,190
as Sally, when you fought
so hard for the role.

356
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:45,436
Oh my God, no! I read the script,

357
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:47,994
and never would've been
able to memorize those lines.

358
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,353
May I ask where your concern lies, then?

359
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:55,111
This is all a little intense.

360
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:57,638
- Hmm?
- Especially for Stevie.

361
00:13:58,596 --> 00:14:00,528
If anything I'm going easy on her.

362
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:02,342
You should've seen the conditioning

363
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:04,077
Rocky put me through.

364
00:14:04,113 --> 00:14:06,012
Our first day consisted of mud runs,

365
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:08,504
- and sob therapy!
- Okay.

366
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:10,295
Well, she's not you,

367
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,730
and I think she's actually
regretting signing up for this.

368
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:15,689
And feels like it was a big mistake.

369
00:14:15,691 --> 00:14:18,491
Really? What gave you that impression?

370
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,561
Because she told me that she
regrets signing up for this,

371
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:23,540
and feels like it was a big mistake.

372
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:25,243
That kind of attitude's
not going to get her

373
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:26,400
very far as an actress.

374
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:28,891
Well, she's clearly not an actress.

375
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:32,182
You told us this morning
that you were here to inspire,

376
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:34,508
instruct, and bring out
the best in all of us.

377
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:37,712
If only we needed to fill
the role of a Dictaphone!

378
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,098
- I'm just saying.
- And your point is made.

379
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:43,525
Thank you.

380
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:45,519
Whatever's left of the five minutes

381
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:47,134
might do us all some good.

382
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,204
Thank you.

383
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,247
All right now, two away!

384
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:05,784
All right, players to first and second!

385
00:15:05,808 --> 00:15:08,809
Outfield in a little bit,
two away now, let's go!

386
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:10,477
Okay, I don't know who this is,

387
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:12,112
but can we put him back in the box?

388
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:14,009
David, keep your glove up!

389
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:15,934
Protect your face!

390
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,459
Hey, Johnny! No coaching.

391
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:20,631
Always be ready!

392
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:21,735
Ugh!

393
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,478
Johnny, why don't you
just put on a little apron,

394
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:25,912
and serve them the win
on a silver platter?!

395
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:27,937
I'm just helping out my son, Roland.

396
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:31,007
The kid has no idea what he's doing!

397
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:32,665
I can hear you!

398
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:36,423
Okay, uh, Ronnie, hit
one out to right field.

399
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:38,148
There's basically nobody out there,

400
00:15:38,173 --> 00:15:40,607
Nobody's gonna catch it, go ahead.

401
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,642
You got this, you got it!

402
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:54,364
- Ohhh!
- You can do it, David!

403
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:55,726
Get out of the way, David!

404
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:58,435
It's okay, David, I got it.

405
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:00,437
Hey, you know what?! It's not okay.

406
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:01,637
I'm doing you the favour,

407
00:16:01,673 --> 00:16:03,992
you told me I was
just a body in a field,

408
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:06,086
not a body that had to catch things,

409
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:07,910
flying very fast in the air!

410
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:09,913
So...

411
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:11,337
I'm out!

412
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:13,664
Well, actually, David, uh, Ronnie's out,

413
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:16,083
and the inning's over, and technically,
you're walking in the right direction.

414
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,268
Well, that's good for you,
then, please get my glove.

415
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:23,069
- Knock, knock!
- Team?

416
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:25,189
Um, a firefighter with back pain?

417
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:28,220
No, try again.

418
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:32,279
Knock, knock!

419
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:35,304
A vacuum salesman? I don't know.

420
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,995
Bob, try to communicate
what's written on the paper.

421
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,654
Is-is there a bell I could ring?

422
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,346
You know, I don't, I
don't wanna be rude,

423
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:46,407
but uh, they could be having dinner.

424
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:51,598
Um, you know, just keep
knocking until someone

425
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:53,978
guesses what, or who you are.

426
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,900
Help me out here.

427
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:58,171
Knock, knock.

428
00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:00,596
Yes, let's you and I sit
this one out, shall we?

429
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:02,643
End things on a lighter note.

430
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:05,101
It is called a "play", not a "work".

431
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:06,743
Someone caught in the rain!

432
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,883
Um, Mrs. Rose?

433
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:11,140
I've been thinking...

434
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,542
Oh, that's your first mistake.

435
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:16,309
Don't think, Stevie,
just trust your instincts.

436
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,765
Okay... well, my
instincts are telling me

437
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,819
that I'm in over my head.

438
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:25,121
See, deciphering which
instincts to trust

439
00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:27,213
that's the real skill.

440
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,670
You're feeling overwhelmed.

441
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:32,095
After some quiet reflection,

442
00:17:32,141 --> 00:17:34,441
it occurred to me that
this morning's exercises

443
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:37,066
might've been a bit advanced.

444
00:17:37,212 --> 00:17:39,779
Please remember, this
is all new to me as well.

445
00:17:39,804 --> 00:17:42,371
Ooh! A guy that works
with animals, but not a vet...

446
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:45,185
We're in this together.

447
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,543
Okay...

448
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:48,878
Might I share with you an
anecdote about my director...

449
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:51,273
- A man with amnesia!
- Yes!

450
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:52,836
Well, he may have a
story or two about that

451
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:54,194
from his later years.

452
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:55,685
No, sorry, I mean, the game.

453
00:17:55,731 --> 00:17:57,764
It-he's a man with amnesia!

454
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:02,269
Yes! Oh, I'm so glad
somebody figured it out!

455
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:05,428
Oh, I actually forgot what
I was supposed to do up here!

456
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:07,717
Ohh!

457
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:09,241
You know that you have to come up

458
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:11,466
and play the game now, right?

459
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:14,263
I think I can handle that.

460
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:19,499
- Ohhh...
- Thanks.

461
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:30,497
Vampire person!

462
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:32,622
Oh! Ghost! Ghost girl!

463
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,234
Hemophiliac!

464
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:35,859
Woman with amnesia!

465
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:37,267
No!

466
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,821
Hey! Patrick.

467
00:18:41,544 --> 00:18:43,110
I don't mean to put any pressure on you,

468
00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:45,945
but you do realize that
it's the bottom of the ninth,

469
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,751
two out, bases are loaded,

470
00:18:47,787 --> 00:18:49,553
and the game's on the line, right?

471
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:51,288
Yeah, I realize that, thank you, Ronnie.

472
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:53,012
So, who's up?

473
00:18:53,037 --> 00:18:54,317
Oh, I think you know who's up.

474
00:18:56,362 --> 00:18:57,828
The barbecue guy wasn't ready,

475
00:18:57,864 --> 00:18:59,130
but he gave me some chips.

476
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:00,955
Okay David, you're up, but
I'm gonna talk to the ump

477
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,747
and see if we can pinch hit for you.

478
00:19:02,772 --> 00:19:04,571
Why? It's the only
part of this stupid game

479
00:19:04,596 --> 00:19:06,363
that I'm actually good at.

480
00:19:06,388 --> 00:19:08,421
Well, you struck out three times, so...

481
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:11,052
I tipped it that one time,
you even admitted that!

482
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:13,423
No, that's true, and that
was a-that was a great tip.

483
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,820
It's just that we're trying to win here.

484
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:18,449
Hey! Hey! Do we have a batter, or what?!

485
00:19:18,485 --> 00:19:20,117
- What's going on?
- Yeah, I'm doing it.

486
00:19:20,153 --> 00:19:22,787
- I'm doing the batting.
- Ohhh, okay, great!

487
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:24,360
- All right!
- Okay.

488
00:19:24,385 --> 00:19:26,650
Easy out everyone, easy out!

489
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,816
Fire up the grill, we'll be
there in a couple of seconds!

490
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:32,640
Okay, everyone shut up!

491
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:34,465
Ronnie, throw the thing.

492
00:19:38,984 --> 00:19:41,126
Unh!

493
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:43,134
Oh my God! Run, David, run!

494
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:45,754
- Way to go, son!
- All right, David!

495
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:47,612
Johnny! Get the ball!

496
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:49,458
This is it!
Go, David! Drop the bat!

497
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:51,682
What are you waiting for, Johnny?

498
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:53,017
Come on, he's going home!

499
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:54,808
All the way, David! All the way!

500
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:56,587
Aaaah!

501
00:19:56,656 --> 00:19:59,089
- Safe!
- Yeaaaaah!

502
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,559
- Are you okay?
- Did I do it?

503
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:03,040
You did it.

504
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:05,163
You did it!

505
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:08,055
Wooo!

506
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,746
Woo!

507
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:13,838
David Rose, hit the ball!

508
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:17,865
Ohhh!

509
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:20,778
- Wooooo!
- Woo! That's my boy!

510
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:29,520
You know, Johnny, the
next time I need a sub,

511
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:33,213
remind me to ask the blind
goat over at Mrs. Divine's farm.

512
00:20:33,238 --> 00:20:35,112
It's just a game, Roland.

513
00:20:35,137 --> 00:20:37,571
Popeye smokes his son
square in the back.

514
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:39,742
It was a quick recovery, Ronnie,

515
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,099
but thanks for
the play-by-play.

516
00:20:41,124 --> 00:20:43,791
Well, luckily for me, I had a side bet

517
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:46,449
on whether Johnny would throw
the game in his kid's favour.

518
00:20:46,474 --> 00:20:48,074
I consider it a split.

519
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:50,585
When you get hit in
the back playing a game

520
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,321
you never wanted to
play in the first place,

521
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:53,557
does that make you the VIP?

522
00:20:53,582 --> 00:20:55,790
The MVP, and uh, no,
we're not doing that.

523
00:20:55,815 --> 00:20:57,681
Okay, what if we were doing it, though?

524
00:20:57,706 --> 00:20:59,221
Well then, you would
definitely be the VIP.

525
00:20:59,246 --> 00:21:00,147
Okay.

526
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:03,002
Listen, I'm sorry if
this game sorta unleashed

527
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:04,426
my competitive side.

528
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:06,242
Yeah, we really don't
need to meet him again.

529
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,644
But, you know, part of me wonders,

530
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:09,401
would you have hit a home run

531
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:11,313
if I hadn't lit that fire in you?

532
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:13,338
Because I have never
seen you run like that.

533
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:15,607
Yeah, it was mainly because
I was smelling the barbeque.

534
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,010
- Ah.
- Up. Higher.

535
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:19,971
- Okay.
- Thank you.

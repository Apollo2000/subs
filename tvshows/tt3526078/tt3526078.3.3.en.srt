1
00:00:03,742 --> 00:00:05,509
What are these sad print-outs?

2
00:00:05,544 --> 00:00:09,180
They're for a proposal I
plan on making to the family.

3
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:11,849
And what kind of proposal
is this, Mr. Rose?

4
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:14,051
Are the police auctioning
off crime scene vehicles?

5
00:00:14,086 --> 00:00:15,519
No, these are only examples,

6
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:17,621
uh, for the proposal.

7
00:00:17,656 --> 00:00:19,724
I think it's time we invest in a car.

8
00:00:19,758 --> 00:00:21,926
I really don't see myself
driving any of these.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,327
Now, these are just examples.

10
00:00:23,362 --> 00:00:24,739
Yeah, I would rather drive a scooter.

11
00:00:24,763 --> 00:00:26,630
And we all know how
I feel about scooters,

12
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:28,733
those... stupid helmets.

13
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:31,202
All right, let's forget the print-outs.

14
00:00:31,236 --> 00:00:33,062
All right? I just think...

15
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:35,015
we could use a car.

16
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:36,841
Everyone has a car!

17
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,009
Roland has a car, Bob has three cars.

18
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:40,835
Stevie... has a car.

19
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:43,028
I want a car!

20
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:44,749
Does this site have boats?

21
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:48,248
Okay, here's what I put together.

22
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:50,473
- Is that a spreadsheet?
- Yes, yes, it is.

23
00:00:50,522 --> 00:00:52,356
And if you'd just let
me finish the pitch

24
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:53,758
the way I planned it,

25
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,226
things will be a lot more clear.

26
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,305
Okay, well, I'm gonna need
the car on Friday nights.

27
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,863
Absolutely not.

28
00:00:58,897 --> 00:01:00,274
Meaning that I would get it Saturday.

29
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:01,999
We don't even have the car yet!

30
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:04,201
Okay, we're just trying to
work within your schedule.

31
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:06,237
Ohh! This is not your
best pitch, darling.

32
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:08,305
I haven't even started the pitch, Moira!

33
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,774
Okay, you know what?!

34
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:11,530
I'm buying a car!

35
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,172
End of story.

36
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,530
Where are you going?

37
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:18,226
Here.

38
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,089
-- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe --

39
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:28,369
You know, really don't
have to go with me, Moira.

40
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:29,727
Oh, I insist.

41
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:31,339
This is a big decision,
and there's no reason

42
00:01:31,363 --> 00:01:33,464
it should rest solely
on your shoulders, dear.

43
00:01:33,498 --> 00:01:35,726
You know, I actually like buying cars.

44
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:38,912
And you're very good at it.

45
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:41,305
But, sometimes your choices...

46
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:43,574
are less suited to a family's needs,

47
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:46,343
and more suited to a
pony-tailed Lothario,

48
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:48,218
cruising the Monte Carlo coast.

49
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:50,444
Or like um, Vin Diesel.

50
00:01:50,582 --> 00:01:52,265
It's called style, people.

51
00:01:52,517 --> 00:01:53,484
(Scoffs)

52
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,430
And you're brimming with it, darling.

53
00:01:55,454 --> 00:01:56,954
But each of us is going to drive this,

54
00:01:56,988 --> 00:01:59,296
and a car says a lot about a person.

55
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:01,892
Not that we can afford a
car that says a lot about us,

56
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:04,662
We did decide to only budget $4,000...

57
00:02:04,696 --> 00:02:06,564
of... my money.

58
00:02:06,598 --> 00:02:08,833
You know, he's got a point there, honey.

59
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:11,502
We can't be eating
into the family funds.

60
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:13,637
Well, fault my over-zealousness,

61
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:16,264
but I think I can... We can find

62
00:02:16,308 --> 00:02:19,443
a zippy little vintage
something on budget.

63
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:21,245
Not dressed like that, you can't.

64
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:22,847
You bought me this dress, David.

65
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:24,248
I know!

66
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:26,917
And it cost twice as much
as the car you wanna buy.

67
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:29,453
No used car salesman
is gonna cut you a deal

68
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:31,989
dressed in archival designer silk.

69
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:33,924
You know, He's got a point there, honey.

70
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,894
Yeah, says the moving
target in the Bespoke suit.

71
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,819
Well, I'm not just gonna be
wearing a suit today, David.

72
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:41,913
I've got a ball cap I can put on.

73
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,366
- Oh!
- David's right.

74
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:48,639
But you know what?
I could build an appropriate look...

75
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:51,475
to mimic the trappings
of a workaday woman.

76
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,043
And if you'll notice, David,

77
00:02:53,078 --> 00:02:54,745
- no cufflinks.
- Wow!

78
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:58,702
I am blinded by the disenfranchisement.

79
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,563
I wouldn't be surprised if
they just gave you the car.

80
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:05,189
(Spoon tapping)

81
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:11,095
Hey, sorry I'm late,

82
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:13,664
there was very heavy foot
traffic on the way over.

83
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:16,046
Do you mind putting these
in Mrs. Hertzman's file?

84
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,002
Oh, hello!

85
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:21,705
Who is this cool cat, and
what did he do with Ted?

86
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,107
Very funny.

87
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:26,076
Unfortunately, the
alternative isn't quite so...

88
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:27,312
cool.

89
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:29,113
Oh my God, what happened?

90
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:30,390
Did you get in a bar fight?

91
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:34,318
Uh, you know, I'd actually
prefer not to talk about it.

92
00:03:34,352 --> 00:03:35,609
Okay...

93
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:37,364
Just for the sake of maintaining

94
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:38,722
some professional boundaries.

95
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:40,291
Yeah, okay, totally.

96
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,353
You owe someone money.

97
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:46,173
Alexis, I pay off my credit card bills

98
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:48,032
two weeks in advance, what do you think?

99
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:49,644
Okay, then why are you
being so weird about it?

100
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:52,403
I'm not being weird... about it.

101
00:03:52,437 --> 00:03:54,705
You're entitled to keep
things private from me.

102
00:03:56,843 --> 00:03:58,177
Okay, fine.

103
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,177
I know that they are for the animals,

104
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:01,712
but I find that when I get tired,

105
00:04:01,746 --> 00:04:04,671
just one or two kind of help me focus.

106
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:07,460
What are you talking about?!

107
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:10,754
Anyway, um,

108
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:12,882
secret or no weird secret,

109
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:15,567
we've gotta cover that thing up.

110
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:18,829
I hope you're not into contouring,

111
00:04:18,863 --> 00:04:20,054
'cause it's not really my thing.

112
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:22,918
(Birds chirp)

113
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:29,239
So the low energy bulbs you
installed in the bathroom,

114
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:32,398
I'm finding the light to
be very harsh, and um...

115
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:34,278
did someone die,

116
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:37,116
or are we going through
like, a mid-life Goth phase?

117
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,312
Someone died.

118
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:41,262
Okay, I'm just finding
the bulbs to make my skin

119
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:43,327
look very jaundice-y.

120
00:04:43,588 --> 00:04:44,976
My great aunt died.

121
00:04:46,324 --> 00:04:48,163
Okay, I can't tell if
we're still joking...

122
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,554
- or not?
- I'm not.

123
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:52,974
Okay, and now I can't
tell whether you're playing

124
00:04:52,998 --> 00:04:55,065
into the joke, or whether um...

125
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,735
- you're telling the truth.
- She was 78.

126
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:59,370
So you're not joking.

127
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:02,506
Okay. Um, well first,
I'd like to apologize

128
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,210
for everything I've said
since coming in here today.

129
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:07,694
Why, you didn't kill her.

130
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,047
I take it you weren't very close.

131
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,421
I actually really liked her.

132
00:05:12,017 --> 00:05:14,124
I mean, she was a mess, but I liked her.

133
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,787
That's probably why I liked her.

134
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:18,599
Anyways, it turns out I'm
one of the few who did,

135
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:21,671
because all of the
arrangements have fallen to me!

136
00:05:22,194 --> 00:05:23,429
Oh.

137
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,630
Um, well if you...

138
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:28,288
need hel...

139
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:33,778
(Clears throat)

140
00:05:34,921 --> 00:05:36,717
I'd like you to finish that sentence.

141
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:39,390
Oh! Um, I am happy to help...

142
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,588
you in this time of need.

143
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:43,614
Thank you, as much as I appreciate

144
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:45,416
your reluctant offer,

145
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,249
I don't think you could handle it.

146
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,476
This whole thing is super depressing.

147
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:51,866
Okay, I think will be fine.

148
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:53,905
So I am happy to help.

149
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:57,890
That is what um, friends
say to each other, right?

150
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,046
Yes, it is.

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,934
Okay. Um...

152
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:06,523
so I'm just gonna change
into my funeral blacks.

153
00:06:06,548 --> 00:06:09,468
And um, and meet you back here, then.

154
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:14,104
(Door opens, slams)

155
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:20,405
(Knocking)

156
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:27,382
Oh, sorry, we don't want any.

157
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:29,827
(Laughs)

158
00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:32,496
I'm just joking. Come on in!

159
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,064
No, I'm not! (Laughs)

160
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:36,300
- Johnny: Roland!
- Just let him in, Rollie!

161
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:38,335
(Laughs) Come on in!

162
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:39,538
Thank you.

163
00:06:39,563 --> 00:06:41,605
Entree vous, s'il vous plait. (Laughs)

164
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,340
- Hi, Johnny.
- Jocelyn.

165
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:45,219
Would you like to join
us for a game of cribbage?

166
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:46,744
We play every day at lunch.

167
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:49,546
That's right, and
Fridays, it's strip crib.

168
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:51,281
Well, thank God it's not Friday.

169
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:52,491
Well, we can pretend.

170
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:54,084
Now, I'm not staying long,

171
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:56,265
I just came by to borrow some clothes.

172
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:58,655
Ah, okay.

173
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:01,007
Honey, why don't you check your closet,

174
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:02,970
and see if you got anything
that Johnny can fit into.

175
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:05,362
Look, Moira and I are going
to a used car lot today,

176
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:08,327
and I just need to appear more um...

177
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:09,488
Official?

178
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:12,102
Casual. Casual.

179
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:13,714
You see, I've got a
closet full of suits,

180
00:07:13,738 --> 00:07:16,740
but uh, I don't wanna
be taken advantage of

181
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:19,042
because I'm overdressed,
I need to look like

182
00:07:19,077 --> 00:07:20,749
I don't have money.

183
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:22,663
But you don't have any money.

184
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:25,358
Oh, I know I don't have any money,

185
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:28,152
but I need to look
like I don't have money.

186
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:30,405
Ohhhh, okay.

187
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:33,123
Here's what I'm hearing you say,

188
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:35,926
what you're saying is
you wanna dress like me,

189
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,398
because I look like I
don't have any money!

190
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:40,491
I think I misspoke.

191
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:42,343
Well, that's what I
heard out of both ears,

192
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:43,700
one of them works pretty well.

193
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:45,694
I mean, anything that looks...

194
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:48,044
um, hip! I need something hip.

195
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,282
Hipper than these suits.
- Hip!

196
00:07:49,307 --> 00:07:50,966
Oh jeez, yeah!

197
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:52,876
Now you're speaking my language!

198
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:55,312
(Laughs) Hip we can do!

199
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:56,680
What do you want, uh PVC,

200
00:07:56,714 --> 00:07:58,982
or a Hawaiian shirt?

201
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:01,761
(Car rumbles)

202
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:05,822
Funeral Director: Sorry about the mess.

203
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,929
We're in the middle of a move.

204
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:12,262
Now unfortunately,
we haven't quite found

205
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:14,064
your Aunt Maureen's ashes,

206
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:16,825
but, we know they're here somewhere.

207
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,984
Okay, well, that's encouraging.

208
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,416
The problem is they all
come in from the crematorium

209
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,046
on the same day,

210
00:08:24,142 --> 00:08:26,148
and sometimes, they're not labeled.

211
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:28,335
Oh?

212
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,395
Is it possible someone
else picked them up?

213
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,834
Unlikely.

214
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,860
I see your great aunt has a sister.

215
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:36,987
Yeah, they haven't spoken in 20 years.

216
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:39,389
- And a step-son.
- He's in prison.

217
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:42,059
- And a cousin.
- Who's also deceased.

218
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:47,097
- What?
- I didn't know.

219
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:49,032
That side of my family
has a bit of a reputation

220
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:51,201
- for conflict.
- Okay.

221
00:08:51,236 --> 00:08:52,812
And philandering.

222
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:55,132
- And fraud.
- Yeah...

223
00:08:55,217 --> 00:08:56,611
And gun-play.

224
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:00,593
Well, I'm sure her remains will turn up.

225
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,515
But we should talk
about urns for your aunt.

226
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,891
We'll just get this one, I guess.

227
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:17,046
Well, that's the shipping
tube we pack the urns in.

228
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:20,101
Found them.

229
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,299
They were on top of the microwave.

230
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,167
Wonderful. Oh, that reminds me.

231
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:27,296
Can you get us some
whitener for the coffees?

232
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:30,687
Oh... what have I been using?

233
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:34,544
Okay, I'm gonna put that down.

234
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:37,602
And what about the service?

235
00:09:38,187 --> 00:09:40,851
Well, since it's just
gonna be us attending,

236
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:42,687
I think we can do without.

237
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:46,523
I see... now, I know
this may sound premature,

238
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:48,692
but have the two of you
thought about the planning

239
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:50,671
of your own funerals?

240
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:52,327
Okay...

241
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:54,598
I think we got what we came here for,

242
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:56,780
so we-I think we can just...

243
00:09:57,077 --> 00:09:58,669
thank you so much.

244
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:01,038
(Traffic rumbles)

245
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:02,606
- (Moira laughs)
- What?

246
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,708
Well, if I squint,

247
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:06,677
I feel like I'm seeing
your rough and rugged

248
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:08,241
country cousin.

249
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:09,947
Oh, and you feel confident

250
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:11,348
you've hit the target with this?!

251
00:10:11,382 --> 00:10:14,351
I apprenticed costume
design under Stan LaCoulier.

252
00:10:14,686 --> 00:10:16,086
I'm sure he'd agree this toggery

253
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,476
is the perfect tribute
to the common woman.

254
00:10:18,823 --> 00:10:20,190
Oh, John, look.

255
00:10:20,224 --> 00:10:21,658
It's our car!

256
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:23,927
Well, Moira, let's not
pick the first car we see.

257
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:25,929
No, before David was born!

258
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:27,431
We bought a car just like this,

259
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:28,966
don't you remember?

260
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,584
Well, I don't remember
the "Everything Be Irie"

261
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:32,736
bumper sticker.

262
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,859
Oh no, it's perfect!

263
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:37,207
- Hello!
- Moira!

264
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:39,743
This car is $3,000 more than our budget.

265
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:41,144
I'm a trained actor.

266
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:43,080
A humble back story
will disabuse this man

267
00:10:43,114 --> 00:10:45,115
of any notion we're too patrician.

268
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,483
Well, okay, but...

269
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:48,773
let's start by losing
words like "patrician."

270
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:51,288
Hey folks, how we doin' today?

271
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:54,342
Oh, excited beyond compare!

272
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:57,227
Yes, especially with this
being our first ever purchase

273
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:58,862
of an automobile.

274
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:00,697
Yes, it's our first car,

275
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:02,632
let's hope we can afford it.

276
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:06,636
Yes, my poor 'usband,
lost his job recently

277
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:08,472
as a tennis pro,

278
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:10,907
yes, at a public resort, that is, yeah.

279
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:13,076
Well, let's get you
folks settled inside,

280
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:14,644
we'll see what we can do.

281
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,046
Oh, thank you.

282
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,647
It'll be nice to get off the streets,

283
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:20,968
and be indoors for a change, yeah?

284
00:11:21,034 --> 00:11:22,535
- Moira...
- What?!

285
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:32,256
Perfect. That's um...

286
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:34,193
We've-we've struggled with penury

287
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:35,865
for quite some time now,

288
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,752
well, just two years ago, we were...

289
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:39,487
practically 'omeless.

290
00:11:40,923 --> 00:11:42,609
Where are you two from?

291
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:45,420
You know, I've been
wondering that myself.

292
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:46,765
I'm from London,

293
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,806
I was one of two identical twins.

294
00:11:48,831 --> 00:11:52,133
Tragically, I was snatched
from my crib at birth

295
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:53,968
by Russian mobsters.

296
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:56,437
Mhmm, they looked at my fair skin,

297
00:11:56,472 --> 00:11:57,939
and my dazzling eyes, and they said,

298
00:11:57,973 --> 00:11:59,841
we'll make a pretty penny on that one,

299
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,109
on the human black market, we will.

300
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:05,554
- And what about the twin?
- What's that, love?

301
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:07,115
Well, if you're identical,

302
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:08,550
I thought you'd both be valuable.

303
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:10,702
Yes, wouldn't you?

304
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:12,708
She wasn't born yet.

305
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:14,687
Yep, she wasn't born.

306
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,357
'Til three minutes later,

307
00:12:16,392 --> 00:12:18,304
and the Bratva work very quickly.

308
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:23,331
That is quite a story.

309
00:12:23,365 --> 00:12:25,819
- Isn't it?
- (Woman clears throat)

310
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:30,747
Um, excuse me, I...
I'll be back in a moment.

311
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:37,118
I think he's buying it!

312
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,740
You think?

313
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:44,185
- (Knocking)
- Hey!

314
00:12:45,171 --> 00:12:46,988
These are for you.

315
00:12:47,022 --> 00:12:48,823
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

316
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:50,889
Lisa dropped them off.

317
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:52,984
- Oh.
- Hey!

318
00:12:53,362 --> 00:12:56,331
- Don't be embarrassed.
- I'm not embarrassed.

319
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:57,799
I know your little secret,

320
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,411
and as your assistant
I will be discreet,

321
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:01,436
- and professional.
- What?

322
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,881
No one's gonna know that you're having

323
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:04,272
an adventurous little rendezvous

324
00:13:04,306 --> 00:13:05,974
with an apple-cheeked farm-woman!

325
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:07,679
But that's not what happened!

326
00:13:08,677 --> 00:13:11,601
- Wink.
- (Sighs)

327
00:13:12,014 --> 00:13:15,483
I was making a house
call to Lisa's farm,

328
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:17,685
and got...

329
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,654
head-butted by her goat.

330
00:13:20,944 --> 00:13:23,491
Is that when one of you is on the floor,

331
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:25,136
and then the other one
kind of just like hops...

332
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,515
No, uh...

333
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:29,264
I was head-butted by an actual goat.

334
00:13:29,298 --> 00:13:30,765
And as a vet, that's not something

335
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,200
that I want getting out,

336
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:33,568
so please don't be thinking

337
00:13:33,602 --> 00:13:35,103
that this is something that it isn't.

338
00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:37,796
Okay. Sorry.

339
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:42,124
Those are delicious, by the way.

340
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:45,446
She practically begged me to try one.

341
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:48,273
So... I did.

342
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:50,882
And I also took a couple for David.

343
00:13:53,655 --> 00:13:55,890
Um, yeah, you're right,
this is a bit depressing.

344
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:57,592
Are we sure this is the right place?

345
00:13:57,626 --> 00:13:58,893
She was very specific

346
00:13:58,928 --> 00:14:00,929
about where she wanted to be scattered.

347
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:02,718
Um, so what are...

348
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:04,632
where-how... Where should we do...

349
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:06,367
Well, I don't want
people parking on her!

350
00:14:06,402 --> 00:14:08,624
- Okay.
- So...

351
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:11,082
Maybe I could just put her
on the grass over there?

352
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:12,476
Sure.

353
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:15,176
- (Sighs)
- Ooh, it smells like cigarettes.

354
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,718
- Ohhh...
- Um...

355
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:18,851
do we scatter it all, or do we...

356
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:21,015
- save some for later?
- Later?!

357
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,069
- I don't know!
- (Sighs heavily)

358
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:27,922
This is gonna be me.

359
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:29,857
Well, theoretically,
it's gonna be all of us.

360
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:31,526
Um, although I'm
hoping that when I pass,

361
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,468
there'll be a little more fanfare.

362
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,108
My great aunt worked at the motel.

363
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:37,937
Front desk.

364
00:14:38,423 --> 00:14:40,648
- You never told me that.
- Yep.

365
00:14:41,637 --> 00:14:44,572
So I just need to take up palm reading,

366
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:46,040
get a few cats,

367
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:47,442
move to Saskatchewan.

368
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:49,010
Well, a girl could dream.

369
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:53,741
You are not your aunt!

370
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:55,627
From what I've heard, I
wouldn't be friends with her,

371
00:14:55,651 --> 00:14:57,929
and I'm friends with you, so
that's one major difference.

372
00:14:58,954 --> 00:15:00,835
She made her decisions.

373
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:02,690
And you're going to make yours,

374
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:04,499
and they are going to be different.

375
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:06,593
And they are going to be great.

376
00:15:08,093 --> 00:15:09,975
And if they're not,
I'll be sure to scatter

377
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,566
your ashes in a much nicer parking lot.

378
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,078
I think I'm just gonna
start pouring, okay?

379
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:14,479
- Okay, so...
- Okay. Not here, though!

380
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:16,749
Let's go just... over there.

381
00:15:16,774 --> 00:15:18,775
Thank you very much for waiting.

382
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:20,775
- Oh.
- This is Sarah,

383
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:22,677
this is my wife, and business partner.

384
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:25,366
Oh hi, is everything okay?

385
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:27,015
Well, I hope you can forgive me,

386
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:30,163
but... I couldn't
help overhear your story.

387
00:15:30,452 --> 00:15:31,919
Oh yes, love,

388
00:15:31,954 --> 00:15:34,122
it's an inspiration to many, I'm sure.

389
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:36,691
And it sounded so familiar.

390
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,335
But then I remembered...

391
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:40,361
"Sunrise Bay!"

392
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:43,007
My wife was addicted to your show!

393
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,199
Well, I find it's wonderful,

394
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:47,101
but we don't have a television, so.

395
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:50,148
- Moira...
- I remember when your twin showed up,

396
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:53,207
and stabbed Armand with
her sharpened crutch.

397
00:15:53,242 --> 00:15:55,209
Okay, look folks, I'm really sorry,

398
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:57,171
my wife was simply...

399
00:15:57,379 --> 00:15:59,147
trying to fictionalize

400
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:01,282
our very real financial struggle.

401
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:02,562
Okay, that was fun.

402
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,095
There's no need to be embarrassed.

403
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:06,721
We read all about...
what happened to you,

404
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:08,956
- losing everything.
- It's heartbreaking.

405
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:11,492
- We didn't lose everything.
- Well...

406
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:13,194
Seeing you working so hard,

407
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:15,096
just to shave a few
bucks off that Lincoln,

408
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,998
which... we could do.

409
00:16:17,032 --> 00:16:19,300
But now you're making
it sound like some...

410
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:21,969
act of desperation, it
was simply just an act.

411
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:24,472
Um Moira, they're just
trying to help us out

412
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:26,441
by giving us a better price.

413
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:27,842
Well, nonsense, dear,

414
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:29,377
we can certainly pay full freight.

415
00:16:29,411 --> 00:16:32,146
You save that discount
for someone who needs it!

416
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:33,714
Yes, okay. Dear, look.

417
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:38,460
We really would appreciate
any financial assistance.

418
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:40,655
Or perhaps we might
have to take our business

419
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:43,791
to a dealership that
sells brand new cars.

420
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:45,170
As you can see, we can't even afford

421
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:46,851
her meds right now.

422
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:50,046
I'll get the paperwork started.

423
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,905
Here we go, dear, here's the chair.

424
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,434
(Birds chirp)

425
00:17:02,277 --> 00:17:03,978
Hey, so I'm headed out,

426
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:07,069
and I will drop off the flea
shampoo for Ms. Warner's cat.

427
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:09,650
Sorry, what did Mrs. Warner say?

428
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:12,053
She called to ask if you
would drop off flea shampoo,

429
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:13,698
and she also asked if
you would wash her cat,

430
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:15,694
but I said that you were too busy.

431
00:17:16,658 --> 00:17:19,994
Oh. Y-yeah. Uh okay, you know what,

432
00:17:20,028 --> 00:17:22,363
- I got this.
- I'm happy to do it.

433
00:17:22,397 --> 00:17:25,433
Um... do we even have flea shampoo?

434
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:27,368
Uh, it's fine, I-I'll do it.

435
00:17:27,402 --> 00:17:29,036
It's best if I do it.

436
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:30,404
No, it's on my way home,

437
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:32,835
and I rarely offer to
do things like this, so.

438
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:34,655
(Sighs)

439
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,155
Heather Warner doesn't
actually have a cat.

440
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:40,588
Ohhh.

441
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:43,171
She like, thinks she has a cat?

442
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:45,257
That's so sad.

443
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:48,318
But I guess she is like
50, so that makes sense.

444
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,398
Yep, she's 42.

445
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:52,059
And she's not crazy.

446
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:56,460
It's... code.

447
00:17:58,367 --> 00:17:59,934
(Laughs quizzically)

448
00:17:59,968 --> 00:18:03,271
I'm kind of seeing Heather,
and the flea shampoo is...

449
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:04,672
A booty call?!

450
00:18:04,706 --> 00:18:06,474
Well, I'm not crazy
about the term, but...

451
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:09,240
Ted, look at you, Little Sexy Susan!

452
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:11,646
Okay, calling me "Susan"
kinda takes the sexy out of it.

453
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,057
But I'm glad we were
able to deal with this

454
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:14,549
in a professional manner.

455
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,751
Ted, say hi to her cat for me.

456
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:19,320
- That's too far, Alexis!
- (Alexis laughs)

457
00:18:24,468 --> 00:18:26,327
To Maureen Budd,

458
00:18:26,361 --> 00:18:30,726
and not following too
closely in her footsteps.

459
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:34,843
So we're drinking to me
not becoming an alcoholic?

460
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:36,171
Mhmm.

461
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:39,837
- (Clinks)
- Off to a good start.

462
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:44,679
Hi, I'm looking for Stevie Budd.

463
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:46,914
- I'm her.
- Hi, we spoke on the phone,

464
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:49,201
I'm Elaine, from West, Read and Healy.

465
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:51,529
I have some personal effects
that were willed to you,

466
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:54,218
- Oh...
- and some documents for you to sign.

467
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:55,856
Thanks.

468
00:18:57,108 --> 00:18:58,642
Oh my God.

469
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:00,546
When did you have this photo taken?

470
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,097
That's not me.

471
00:19:03,131 --> 00:19:04,335
That's Maureen.

472
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,279
Mmm.

473
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:09,505
Okay, well, just because you bear

474
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,505
a vague physical resemblance,

475
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,444
does not mean that you...

476
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:17,178
will end up in an apartment
with newspaper for curtains.

477
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:20,014
Okay, this is not going to be you.

478
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,687
What is this?

479
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:25,054
That is the deed to the motel.

480
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:27,226
Sorry?

481
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,882
Maureen Budd owned the motel.

482
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,968
You didn't tell me that.

483
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:34,929
Nobody told me that.

484
00:19:34,963 --> 00:19:36,397
I mean, I knew it was in the family,

485
00:19:36,431 --> 00:19:38,577
but I didn't know she outright owned it.

486
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:42,551
Was she of sound mind?

487
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:44,761
Uh well, according to her will,

488
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:46,912
she wanted you to have it.

489
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,026
Was she of sound mind?!

490
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,050
Okay, this still doesn't mean

491
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:58,386
that you are going to
be anything like her!

492
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,121
I mean sure, on the surface,

493
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:02,957
it is a step in that
direction, but, you know,

494
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:04,912
um, okay, you know what?

495
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,894
- Let's clear some of this stuff.
- Yeah.

496
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:09,030
Starting with the urn.

497
00:20:09,064 --> 00:20:11,312
And I'm-we're gonna just...

498
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:17,977
(Engine idles, shuts off)

499
00:20:21,858 --> 00:20:23,859
(Door slams, keys jingle)

500
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,652
You look like a contestant
on "The Price Is Right."

501
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:30,289
Well, it worked, because
the price was right.

502
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:32,358
How much did you pay for this?

503
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:33,759
David, it's not polite to ask

504
00:20:33,794 --> 00:20:35,161
what you paid for something.

505
00:20:35,195 --> 00:20:37,229
It says $7,250 right there.

506
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:38,731
Well, that's way over budget!

507
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:40,699
Well, that's not what we paid for it.

508
00:20:40,734 --> 00:20:42,101
Well, what did you pay for it?!

509
00:20:42,135 --> 00:20:43,803
$6,000 quid, love.

510
00:20:43,837 --> 00:20:45,337
- Oh God!
- Thank you, Moira.

511
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:46,739
And it would've been a lot less,

512
00:20:46,773 --> 00:20:48,384
if your mother hadn't
talked them back up!

513
00:20:48,408 --> 00:20:50,443
You can't put a price on dignity.

514
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:52,577
Uh, tell that to your outfit.

515
00:20:53,313 --> 00:20:54,812
This is your outfit.

516
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:56,615
- What?!
- Okay, look.

517
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,418
The important thing
is, we now have a car!

518
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:00,953
Is this a car for dead people?

519
00:21:00,987 --> 00:21:02,955
No, it's not a hearse!

520
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:05,925
Look, this is a used
car, so it's not perfect.

521
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:08,461
Were all the other cars on fire, then?

522
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:13,208
It's very big.

523
00:21:14,601 --> 00:21:19,638

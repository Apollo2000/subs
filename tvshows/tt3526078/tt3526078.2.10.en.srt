1
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:05,532
- Morning!
- Hey! How are you?

2
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:07,099
- Oh!
- Good morning!

3
00:00:07,134 --> 00:00:10,108
Hi. Oh, just continue on inside.

4
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:11,680
Well, I hope we didn't
catch the two of you

5
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:14,050
with your pants down.

6
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,885
- Oh...
- I'm just joking, I can see they're on.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,888
No, we actually listened
outside to make sure.

8
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:20,455
We just brought some leftovers by.

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,557
We had a little thing
at the house last night

10
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:24,760
and we didn't want all the
food to go to waste, so.

11
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:26,428
Yeah, and you know what?

12
00:00:26,463 --> 00:00:27,797
We would have invited the two of you

13
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,666
but it was kind of a...
Political schmooze-fest.

14
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:34,203
A lot of pressing of the
flesh, and greasing palms,

15
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:35,436
that kind of thing, you know.

16
00:00:35,462 --> 00:00:37,429
It wasn't as much fun as it sounds.

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,741
Oh well, who wants an
invitation to big soiree

18
00:00:39,777 --> 00:00:41,944
when you can be met
the very next morning

19
00:00:41,978 --> 00:00:43,600
with some table scraps.

20
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,926
You know, people were
talking about you too, Moira.

21
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:49,203
Oh, they were talking
about the other candidate?

22
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,420
Yes!

23
00:00:50,454 --> 00:00:53,622
You know, I can't wait for
this whole thing to just be over

24
00:00:53,656 --> 00:00:55,991
so we can all just hang out again.

25
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:57,826
- Yeah, yeah...
- Mm-hmm.

26
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,329
Well, we are off to the bank.

27
00:01:00,363 --> 00:01:03,799
We've got lots of donations
that we need to deposit.

28
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,606
- Well, thank you. Bye!
- Bye!

29
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,838
Those two are not as
simple minded as we thought.

30
00:01:09,873 --> 00:01:11,108
He is.

31

32
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:20,849
David, Ted said that
I had to wear scrubs,

33
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:22,350
but what does that mean really?

34
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:25,287
Um, I think it means
you have to wear scrubs.

35
00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:27,593
Ugh. I know but look at me.

36
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:30,893
You look... amazing.

37
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:32,125
Who designs these things?!

38
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,463
Whatever happened to
empowering women's sexuality?

39
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:37,045
I don't think sex appeal

40
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:39,304
is the guiding principle
behind nursing uniforms.

41
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:41,914
Obviously you've never been
out for Halloween, David.

42
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:44,173
So are you nervous?

43
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:46,542
This is like the first
job you've ever had.

44
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,144
No it isn't.

45
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:50,045
Putting your name on a
line of edible nail polish

46
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,828
isn't what I would call having a job.

47
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,849
I was very hands on, David.

48
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:56,152
I came up with all
the flavours by myself.

49
00:01:56,186 --> 00:01:58,045
Even the one that
poisoned all those people?

50
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:00,956
David, the factory in
Guangzhou assured us

51
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,507
that it was lead-free. Ugh!

52
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:06,671
Anyway, I'm actually really
looking forward to this.

53
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:09,931
You look like a stick of gum.

54
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:12,795
Like... what? David!

55
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:20,413
Well how much did she take?

56
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:23,778
Um, I'm gonna go get a
latte. Do you need anything?

57
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:26,115
She's an IT manager, Gerald.

58
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,616
She makes more money
than both of us combined.

59
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:31,120
I shouldn't be worrying
about these things.

60
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,335
I would love a hot tea.

61
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,328
Okay. Um...

62
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,862
Is everything okay?

63
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:42,444
Yup. Just chatting.

64
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:46,913
Listen, let me give
you some cash for that.

65
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:51,569
I don't think that expense
card is long for this world.

66
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:54,009
Mm, okay. It's just I have, um,

67
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:56,646
four more taxidermy peacocks
coming this afternoon.

68
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,375
Oh, I can pay cash
for those. That's fine.

69
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:04,120
Don't answer that.

70
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:06,354
It's either Gerald or the school

71
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,038
and I can't deal with either right now.

72
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:11,860
Okay. Um, this is really intense,

73
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:13,156
so I'm gonna go get that tea.

74
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:16,831
You're a doll. You're a doll!

75
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:23,072
Hey! Sorry I'm a bit late.

76
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:25,106
Um, I wasn't sure what the etiquette was

77
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,509
for this kind of thing,

78
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:27,670
so I walked around
the block a little bit.

79
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:30,378
Oh, you can show up early, or on time.

80
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:31,656
Early is probably even better.

81
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,348
Okay, great.

82
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:35,183
Alexis, you wanted to be
treated professionally,

83
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:36,586
so I have to ask,

84
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,139
where are the rest of your scrubs?

85
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:41,615
Oh. I thought this was
kind of an either/or thing.

86
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,735
No, they come as a set.
That's why I gave you both.

87
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:46,781
Those bare legs are dangerous.

88
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:48,173
Ted!

89
00:03:48,198 --> 00:03:49,564
No, I'm serious.

90
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,324
The animals carry bugs or ticks

91
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:52,783
that can burrow into your bare skin.

92
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:54,670
Ew!

93
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:57,139
Don't worry, we'll just have
you focus on filing for today.

94
00:03:57,174 --> 00:03:58,475
Um, okay. Awesome!

95
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,687
Thank you. So many files!

96
00:04:02,852 --> 00:04:05,287
I'll just dive right into this.

97
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,045
You won't even miss your last secretary

98
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,632
once I get finished with these puppies.

99
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:11,342
Good news!

100
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:15,437
I found you a loaner pair.
Helen must have left them.

101
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,947
Phew.

102
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:21,882
Thank you, Ted. Those are just perfect.

103
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:26,288
Hello!

104
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:30,514
Ronnie! Hello you!
You're looking well today!

105
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,375
New khakis I see.

106
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:34,610
Are you enjoying your coffee?

107
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:36,444
I was.

108
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:41,817
I'm going to presume you were
at Jocelyn's thing last night.

109
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:43,185
How was that?

110
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,788
- Good. Lots of dairy.
- Oh, yes.

111
00:04:46,822 --> 00:04:49,292
If anyone knows how to put a
lactose intolerant in the hospital,

112
00:04:49,326 --> 00:04:51,148
it's our Jocelyn.

113
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,238
Moira, is there something
I can do for you?

114
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:56,231
Yes, thank you!

115
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:59,567
Ronnie, I was wondering whether or not

116
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:02,637
you have decided on a
candidate to endorse?

117
00:05:02,673 --> 00:05:05,173
- Not yet.
- Oh! Good.

118
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,663
Why is that good?

119
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:09,077
I'm hoping I might persuade you

120
00:05:09,112 --> 00:05:11,350
to put your weight behind me.

121
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:14,887
Political weight.

122
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:19,045
I now realize 'clout' was
the word I was looking for.

123
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:23,257
What makes you think I'd vote for you?

124
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:27,697
You are a sensible woman, Ronnie,

125
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,497
and you speak your mind.

126
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:32,134
I-i can feel your
frustration with Roland.

127
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:35,036
Now imagine his wife on council,

128
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:36,764
strengthening his agenda...

129
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:41,576
- And?
- And, were I on council,

130
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,646
I could support your agenda.

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,944
We could support each other's agendas.

132
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:50,353
Well, I don't hate what you're saying,

133
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:52,355
so here's what I'm gonna do.

134
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:55,191
I'm gonna invite some
of my girl friends over

135
00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:58,827
and if you can get on the
good side of these women,

136
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:03,913
let's just say you'd be
locking down a key demographic.

137
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:05,358
It's a date.

138
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:08,398
No. No, it's not. I
wouldn't call it that.

139
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:09,790
No, i-i didn't... I didn't mean...

140
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:11,841
- Uh! Just...
- No, I...

141
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,242
- Thank you.
- Okay.

142
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:14,643
Thank you, Ronnie.

143
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:18,547
Um, Doris, that is so exciting!

144
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:20,115
Love him for you!

145
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:23,218
I don't know. I mean, poor
Albert's allergic to cats.

146
00:06:23,252 --> 00:06:25,153
But I can't leave Mittens alone.

147
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:27,423
So how do I spend time with Albert?

148
00:06:31,127 --> 00:06:32,827
Veterinary clinic, how can I help you?

149
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:34,420
Can I put you on hold?

150
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:38,466
Okay, so if there's one thing I learned,

151
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:39,935
is that when it comes to love

152
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,531
you cannot let little
things get in your way.

153
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:45,007
Like I once dated this sultan's nephew

154
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,644
who was forbidden to talk
to me or even to look at me

155
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:52,180
and we made it work for like
half a regime change, so...

156
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:54,850
- You what?
- I know.

157
00:06:54,884 --> 00:06:57,819
- Uh, Alexis,
- Yes.

158
00:06:57,853 --> 00:07:00,007
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

159
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:03,194
We're gonna put this on
pause. The doctor needs me.

160
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,129
- Yes?
- So how's the filing coming?

161
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:08,730
I have been swamped.

162
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:11,233
Doris's cat is like
totally high maintenance.

163
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:13,468
Yeah, well, Doris has
been worried about her cat

164
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:15,637
for two years. She comes in every week.

165
00:07:15,672 --> 00:07:17,406
Okay, well, what am I supposed to do?

166
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,774
Poor thing is like desperate for a man.

167
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,367
And, uh, why are there
three calls on hold?

168
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:25,209
Um... I don't know, someone hung up?

169
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:28,312
Okay, Alexis, there is more to the job

170
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:30,305
than just keeping the
customers happy, all right?

171
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:33,264
This is a place of
business and right now,

172
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,233
there are clients waiting to talk to me.

173
00:07:36,393 --> 00:07:38,812
Are you sure that
you're cut out for this?

174
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:41,108
- Mm.
- Okay.

175
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:42,334
'Kay.

176
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:46,170
Well, look, I-I can't
talk about this now,

177
00:07:46,235 --> 00:07:47,944
I have to go.

178
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,336
I just wanted to let you know

179
00:07:49,406 --> 00:07:52,074
that we just sold one
of the leather ponchos.

180
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:54,334
Oh, we're selling leather ponchos now?

181
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:56,478
Well, that doesn't sound cheap.

182
00:07:56,512 --> 00:07:58,279
No, it's not, which
is why it's so exciting

183
00:07:58,475 --> 00:07:59,812
that we just sold one.

184
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:02,706
- That's fabulous, David.
- It is.

185
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:04,586
Um, so I was gonna go,

186
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,855
unless needed me for something else.

187
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,290
That was Gerald and...

188
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:10,425
now I have a meeting
at the school tomorrow

189
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:14,031
and I've got no one to take
care of my stepdaughter.

190
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,831
His ex-wife certainly won't do it.

191
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:19,701
Wow... well, if there's
anything I can do, just...

192
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:23,437
I need someone to take
care of my stepdaughter.

193
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:27,042
Okay. Well, if there's
anything I can do, just...

194
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:30,920
I need you to take
care of my stepdaughter.

195
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:33,895
'Kay, I don't think
that's a very good idea.

196
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:36,588
I'm gonna drop her off at four.

197
00:08:37,836 --> 00:08:39,537
I'm looking forward to it.

198
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,591
You're a doll.

199
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:53,029
I brought you some trail mix,
but I spilled it in my purse.

200
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:56,320
So sweet of you, Doris. Thank you.

201
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,907
Hey, I was thinking about
what you said yesterday

202
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:06,686
and, um, I think...
Now is not a good time.

203
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:10,313
Okay. Um... how are things with Mittens?

204
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:13,793
Uh... he-he's dead.

205
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:15,952
Ew!

206
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:18,355
I'm just trying to figure
out what happened, all right?

207
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:20,857
Okay. Um, well, what am
I supposed to tell Doris?

208
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:22,393
Don't say anything to her.

209
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:24,628
Just keep her company while
I figure this out, okay?

210
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:26,562
Okay, so I'm just supposed
to act like nothing happened?

211
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:28,565
- Yeah, for now.
- Okay.

212
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Um, how am I supposed to do that?

213
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:33,070
- Alexis.
- Okay.

214
00:09:33,577 --> 00:09:35,471
Yeah. 'Kay.

215
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:44,748
Hi!

216
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:49,086
Um... do you have any like DVDs

217
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,155
or like a dusty old
board game I could borrow?

218
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:54,658
Oh, usually we reserve those
for our platinum members.

219
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:56,125
Mhmm.

220
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:57,927
Oh, but I do have a Rummoli box

221
00:09:57,962 --> 00:10:00,596
filled with puzzle
pieces on the shelf there.

222
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:02,932
Sounds like something you'd
find at a serial killer's house.

223
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:04,735
Hmm. Big night planned?

224
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:10,327
Um, I am babysitting tonight, so...

225
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:12,609
You're joking.

226
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:14,520
Mm-mm. I wish I was joking.

227
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:16,046
But you hate kids.

228
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:17,914
Mm-hmm. That's correct.

229
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:20,451
- Oh my God. Can I watch?
- No.

230
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:21,884
- Or video tape?
- No, you... no.

231
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,453
- Can I bring friends?
- No.

232
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:25,588
My boss's life is a
bit of a mess right now,

233
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:30,126
so I said I'd help out by
babysitting her stepdaughter.

234
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:33,797
And you're sure you
can do this on your own?

235
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:35,264
Mm-hmm.

236
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:37,500
Um, 'cause I'm a fully
capable human being.

237
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:41,701
Um, if you happen to find any Xanax...

238
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,407
Lying around anywhere,

239
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:46,210
can you just... Let me know about that?

240
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,092
I-I think I might just pick
up these treats while I wait.

241
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:07,498
Oh... um, yeah, no, um...

242
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:10,667
But these treats are actually
gonna go on sale next week,

243
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:12,769
so maybe you just wanna
hold off until then?

244
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:14,975
Well, I think he'd really like them.

245
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,068
Yeah...

246
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:20,277
I'm sure he would really like them...

247
00:11:20,302 --> 00:11:23,898
If he wasn't... dead.

248
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,085
- What?
- Yeah, he's dead.

249
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:32,905
But! But the good news is, you're not.

250
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:34,671
Mittens is dead?

251
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:37,163
Yeah. But um...

252
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:43,014
But you're free, Doris,
and, in a way, so is Mittens.

253
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,278
- Oh. What happened?
- We're not sure yet,

254
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:48,905
but I think that the important thing

255
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,307
is that Mittens is no longer suffering.

256
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:53,543
Oh, what do I do now?

257
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:57,947
Do I put him in a box? Bury him?

258
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:01,333
Ew! No, we don't have to talk
about that right now, okay?

259
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:02,852
I know this is hard.

260
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:05,688
But, um, the upside, um...

261
00:12:05,722 --> 00:12:09,559
The upside... Oh! Is that
Albert from the down the hall

262
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:10,961
can now come over for dinner

263
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:13,984
without worrying about his
allergies threatening his life.

264
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,633
Hey. I think it's time that we find you

265
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,902
a new love of your life.

266
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:21,738
It's okay.

267
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:25,514
♪

268
00:12:27,991 --> 00:12:30,681
John, wait. I didn't tell you earlier

269
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:33,517
because I didn't want
you to back out on me,

270
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:37,053
but you're going to be the
only man here this evening.

271
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,088
Well, I think I can handle that.

272
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:41,591
Mm-hmm? Ronnie told me that her friends

273
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,726
represent a key demographic

274
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:46,842
and I don't believe
it's women with husbands.

275
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,500
- Oh...
- Mm-hmm.

276
00:12:50,548 --> 00:12:51,881
I feel really good about this,

277
00:12:51,907 --> 00:12:53,274
and I think you just
approach these women

278
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:54,698
like you did Paula, our landscaper.

279
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:57,303
Very strong, very forceful.

280
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:02,346
- Oh!
- Hello, Ronnie.

281
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:04,248
- Hi.
- Hello.

282
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:07,522
Come in... both of you.

283
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:19,028
We're counting down the
top 100 hottest stars in Hollywood.

284
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:21,030
From this Canadian...

285
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:23,200
Has that actress had work done too?

286
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:24,600
Um, yeah, you can always tell

287
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:26,336
because their upper lip sort of...

288
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,172
I mean, like, puffs a bit.

289
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:29,572
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

290
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:31,642
- Do you want more coffee?
- Yes, please.

291
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:38,115
Okay, so we've run out of sugar.

292
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:41,418
Um, do you want it still
because I don't really.

293
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:46,289
This star has everyone wondering...

294
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:48,759
How will that face turn out?

295
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:51,161
Well, folks, take a look at her now!

296
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:52,725
You okay?

297
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,131
I'm fine...

298
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:58,350
- Are you sure?
- Something happened.

299
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,772
What?!

300
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:04,866
Nothing. Just d-don't look on the bed.

301
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,679
The self-described tom-boy...

302
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:13,317
... Has become a
serious star on the rise,

303
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,619
which is why we've named her number...

304
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:17,460
- It's okay!
- On our hot list!

305
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:20,557
Needless to say, that was the last time

306
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:22,292
I played charades with Fran Leibovitz.

307
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:27,764
Oh, this is wonderful. Wonderful!

308
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:29,499
And I would love to regale you all night

309
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:32,836
with entertaining anecdotes,
but I would be remiss

310
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,272
if I didn't outline some of my policies

311
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:38,040
for this community of remarkable women.

312
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:40,491
Moira, could I have a word?

313
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,514
Excuse us, ladies. Family matter.

314
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:46,515
I knew I should've left
him home with the sitter.

315
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:53,624
Moira, I have a feeling not
every woman here is a lesbian.

316
00:14:53,764 --> 00:14:56,158
Oh, John, you love to think
women are flirting with you.

317
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:58,961
No, I was just talking
someone over there

318
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:02,273
who has a husband. A male husband.

319
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,567
Everything all right?

320
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:06,135
Yes. Ronnie,

321
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:08,605
when mentioned earlier
that I might lock down

322
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,553
a key demographic this
evening, you meant what?

323
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:13,243
Entrepreneurs.

324
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,546
Everyone here is a member of
the women's business association.

325
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:19,448
Oh. Business association.

326
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:20,889
Yes, that's what I...

327
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:23,921
I think we're all ready when you are.

328
00:15:24,588 --> 00:15:26,475
All I'm missing is my teleprompter!

329
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:33,096
- Business association.
- Yes, I heard her.

330
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,155
Oh God.

331
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:44,975
You know, I have to
say that I'm impressed.

332
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:47,110
It's not everyone who
can tell an old woman

333
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:49,513
that her cat is dead, and
set up a love connection,

334
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:52,434
and sell our most expensive marble urn

335
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,153
in the same three-minute conversation.

336
00:15:54,178 --> 00:15:55,885
Well, I'm not totally sure
about the love connection.

337
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,221
I'm still waiting for
Doris to text me back.

338
00:15:58,255 --> 00:15:59,648
- Right.
- So.

339
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:01,957
Uh, was there something
that you wanted to say to me?

340
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:03,731
- What?
- Uh, just earlier,

341
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:05,895
it seemed like you were
trying to tell me something.

342
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:09,533
Oh! No, I think it was
about, um, vacation days.

343
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:11,902
- Ah.
- Yeah, you had mentioned two weeks.

344
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,937
So I guess I was just wondering,

345
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:17,264
um, how many two-week vacations
are available per year?

346
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,411
Well, tell you what, why
don't we start with one

347
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:23,195
and then we'll just go from there.

348
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:26,482
Okay. Yeah. That could work.

349
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:28,429
- Great.
- Great.

350
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:35,412
Honestly? Nothing is more natural...

351
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:39,264
Um, aside from maybe the...
thread count in these sheets,

352
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:42,432
but that's okay! 'Cause
you're a woman now!

353
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:47,547
Um, and nothing about
that is embarrassing.

354
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:49,639
I'm not embarrassed, I'm scared!

355
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:51,408
I mean, you were talking so much

356
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:53,176
about your high thread count linens...

357
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:55,412
Yeah. Well, I think it's gonna come out.

358
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:57,980
And how they were made
by Egyptians or something?

359
00:16:58,014 --> 00:17:00,984
No, I'm well aware of that. Um, so...

360
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:06,388
So, uh, I think my sister
has some wonderful products

361
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:07,891
in there for you.

362
00:17:07,924 --> 00:17:10,259
Uh, health accessories,

363
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,208
so feel free to help yourself to those.

364
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:19,505
Um... okay.

365
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:23,140
Uh...

366
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:26,809
So you can just tie that
around your waist, okay?

367
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:29,913
Yeah, thank you.

368
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:33,115
Mmm... okay.

369
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:45,104
Equality. Freedom. Marriage.

370
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:48,432
These are the rights of every community,

371
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:53,630
and even more specifically...
The business community.

372
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:57,840
No faction of society deserves
to be discriminated against,

373
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:03,637
especially women who...
Are in business faction.

374
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:09,505
One of my top priorities will be to...

375
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,955
To change people's misguided

376
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,480
and ignorant perceptions
of women like you.

377
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:19,328
You did not choose this life!

378
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:25,200
No, each one of you was
born to be an entrepreneur.

379
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:30,145
Why don't I open up the floor
to some of your concerns?

380
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:34,443
I want to elect someone who
understands the pressures

381
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:36,817
of working and raising a family.

382
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:40,450
Very nice, yes. I love that.

383
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:42,818
- Working and... ?
- Raising a family.

384
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,473
And raising a family.

385
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:47,223
Well, John, my husband
will back me up on this,

386
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:49,226
I had a six-and-a-half
season career

387
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:53,708
as an actress in television,
which I put on hold

388
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:56,732
to devote all my time and energy

389
00:18:56,914 --> 00:19:00,433
to raise two million
dollars for charity.

390
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:03,105
And two children.

391
00:19:03,323 --> 00:19:05,423
Oh, yes, and two children.

392
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:09,613
Hmm? And on top of that, I
managed a staff of twelve.

393
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:11,294
You ran your own business?

394
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,760
Household staff, yes.

395
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:16,083
Ronnie says you've
only lived here a year?

396
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:18,387
That's true, Ronnie, thank you,

397
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:20,059
but I am a quick study.

398
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:24,153
Karen, I learned tonight that
you run a gravel business, yes,

399
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:27,377
and you, Audrey, you manage
a team of accountants,

400
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:28,632
and you, Tara,

401
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:30,634
you're very concerned
about your inverted nipples.

402
00:19:33,203 --> 00:19:34,837
Which I assumed was public domain;

403
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:37,184
there were a lot of you
around when she told.

404
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,746
Well, ladies, I'm-I'm not
that different from any of you.

405
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:45,382
I had my first job at the age of ten,

406
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:47,465
sweeping up hair in a beauty salon.

407
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:50,819
I will never forget the
value of a hard day's work.

408
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,390
Believe me when I tell you, if elected,

409
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:56,625
I will put just as much
work into my time on council

410
00:19:56,661 --> 00:20:00,926
as you women put into
your businesses every day.

411
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,223
Oh, being in business myself,

412
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,292
I've attended quite a
few of these functions,

413
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:16,528
and this one was quite the success.

414
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:18,696
Yeah, I think your wife's gonna do okay.

415
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,332
Well, she pulled it off, didn't she?

416
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:22,534
Considering she came
in - well, we both did -

417
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:26,333
- thinking everyone was...
- Black?

418
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:30,005
No. I mean that everyone was leaning...

419
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,310
- Younger?
- John, we should go.

420
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:34,011
No, what I mean is that, uh,

421
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:38,416
that I am very comfortable
seeing women with other women.

422
00:20:38,451 --> 00:20:41,118
- Uh-huh. - Yeah, that
didn't come out right. I...

423
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:43,355
M-Moira and I have been
very, very supportive

424
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:46,357
of the LGBTQ community.

425
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:48,059
- Oh, John... John.
- For...

426
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:50,208
Did I leave out a letter?

427
00:20:50,278 --> 00:20:52,364
Thank you so much, Ronnie.

428
00:20:52,397 --> 00:20:54,900
I love your friends and
I really loved that dip.

429
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:58,817
Oh, the dip was incredible,
really, for men and women.

430
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,650
That's... good night.

431
00:21:13,676 --> 00:21:17,366

1
00:00:08,024 --> 00:00:10,539
What happened? Who died?

2
00:00:10,564 --> 00:00:12,431
- Who died?
- Did Patrick die?

3
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:13,957
No, Patrick didn't die, David.

4
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:15,795
Then why did you startle
me awake like this?

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,183
My mind went straight to some
kind of unthinkable tragedy.

6
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,676
Like something really,
really bad happened.

7
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:23,951
Oh. Imagine.

8
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:27,049
Well, the day did
have a slight singultus

9
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:29,261
- What is she talking about?
- A hiccup.

10
00:00:29,286 --> 00:00:30,497
- What hiccup? Who's hiccuping?

11
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:32,091
Okay, David, shush for a minute.

12
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:35,591
There was a big storm last night.

13
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:37,593
And things got a bit wet.

14
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:39,495
How wet?

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,324
We've been looking into changing venues.

16
00:00:42,349 --> 00:00:44,843
- Oh my God. To where? Bob's Garage?

17
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:48,582
No, his roof was no match
for the cumulus clouds.

18
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:50,588
I've woken up in a
"Black Mirror" episode.

19
00:00:50,613 --> 00:00:52,115
This might be a stupid question

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,317
because there is like literally
nothing you can do about it,

21
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:56,410
but why didn't you guys get a tent?

22
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:57,635
Not helping, Alexis.

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,464
Because I wanted the
wood-fired pizza oven

24
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,089
and we couldn't afford both.

25
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:02,782
Someone has to call the officiant.

26
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:04,115
He's on his way from Elmdale.

27
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:08,363
What happened to Fabian?!

28
00:01:08,388 --> 00:01:10,459
He canceled because of the rain.

29
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:13,092
What kind of adult man
rides a penny-farthing?

30
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:14,836
He's a haikuist!

31
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:17,782
Well, David... I-I-I
could easily step in here.

32
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:20,037
I have a lot to say about...

33
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,234
my son getting married...

34
00:01:22,335 --> 00:01:23,443
Okay.

35
00:01:23,468 --> 00:01:26,314
You can barely get through this
without crying, so that's a no.

36
00:01:26,339 --> 00:01:28,007
A note, I did bring the house down

37
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:29,899
at Pat Sajak's first wedding.

38
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,335
- Oh my God.
- Johnny: Oh I remember that.

39
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:34,423
"Can I buy a vow."

40
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:37,428
I had the studio audience
wrapped around my finger.

41
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:40,380
Well, there is one problem solved.

42
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:42,567
So let's leave the rest to me, okay?

43
00:01:42,592 --> 00:01:44,566
We have money now and
the last thing I want

44
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:48,336
is to leave town with some
cheap-ass, soggy wedding.

45
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:49,728
- Mhmm.
- Okay.

46
00:01:49,753 --> 00:01:51,975
What if the sun comes
out and everything's fine.

47
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,081
Fuck!

48
00:01:57,904 --> 00:02:00,786
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

49
00:02:00,904 --> 00:02:02,268
- Yep.
- Mhmm.

50
00:02:02,741 --> 00:02:04,686
Where are you going?!

51
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:07,313
Moira: Somewhere safe.

52
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:16,698
Okay. We should've gotten a tent.

53
00:02:16,723 --> 00:02:19,068
- I didn't need pizza that badly.
- Wow, let's not get crazy.

54
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:21,260
No, we should have
gotten married indoors.

55
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:22,986
You said indoor weddings are tacky.

56
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:24,773
No. I said most weddings are tacky.

57
00:02:24,798 --> 00:02:27,066
And they often take place indoors.

58
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:29,301
- Hm. David... we all know how much

59
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:31,413
the success of this
wedding means to you.

60
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:35,121
So we are going to make the
absolute best of today, okay?

61
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:37,395
And regardless of how that happens

62
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,692
or where that happens,
at the end of the day,

63
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:41,918
I am going to kiss that
worried-looking face of yours

64
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:43,620
and call you my husband.

65
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:46,123
And that's the only thing that matters.

66
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:48,758
Okay,

67
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:50,636
I just refuse to get married
in Roland's living room.

68
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:52,095
I have to draw the line somewhere.

69
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,054
Okay. Okay.

70
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,490
Besides those carpets
do not photograph well.

71
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:58,201
All right, I am heading to the motel

72
00:02:58,302 --> 00:02:59,692
to sort all this out with your Dad.

73
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:01,251
In the meantime,

74
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:04,116
I have arranged for a massage
to chill you out a little bit.

75
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:06,061
So you can just lie down, relax

76
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,043
and not talk until we
have a plan, all right?

77
00:03:08,643 --> 00:03:10,611
How did you book a
massage so last-minute?

78
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:12,916
Oh no, all this was planned weeks ago.

79
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:14,973
Just had a hunch you wouldn't
handle stress well today.

80
00:03:14,998 --> 00:03:17,983
Okay, I've been handling
the stress just fine.

81
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:20,209
You had like three
bagels in half an hour.

82
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:23,326
- They were a mistake.
- It's all taken care of

83
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:25,304
and I've told them we
need you calm today.

84
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:26,762
So just let them do their job. Okay?

85
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:29,466
Okay. I just feel like
I need to be around for...

86
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:31,134
Goodbye, David.

87
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:32,848
Don't neglect the lighting.

88
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:34,841
Okay. Love you, too.

89
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:38,996
Love you. Thanks.

90
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,160
"Hello, you.

91
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:49,239
Are-are we all ready to spin
the wheel of life today?"

92
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:53,063
Even Vanna White didn't
laugh at that one.

93
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,072
Alexis, have I ever told you

94
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:02,532
how bewitching you are.

95
00:04:04,504 --> 00:04:07,461
- It's a compliment.
- No. I know. I'm sorry.

96
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:10,188
I'm just feeling like,
a little emotional today.

97
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:13,376
Is it David? Did he say
something to upset you?

98
00:04:13,477 --> 00:04:15,945
He can be very cruel, but
it's all fear-based, Dear.

99
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,738
So please don't take it personally.

100
00:04:17,763 --> 00:04:20,216
No, I just realized that
this is like the last time

101
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:22,009
- that we're all gonna be here.
- No.

102
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:23,615
- Like this.
- Stop.

103
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,194
Like, soon I won't be able
to just like come in here

104
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:27,389
and say hey.

105
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:29,998
No, I think you'll be
surprised at how quickly

106
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:32,104
you'll appreciate the luxury of privacy.

107
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:33,797
I remember there was like a whole year

108
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:35,303
that we just didn't even see each other.

109
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:37,062
That's not true.

110
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,118
Unless it was the year I booked
that international campaign

111
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:41,911
for Looky-Loo Binoculars.

112
00:04:41,936 --> 00:04:43,670
I'm just saying...

113
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,932
A part of me feels like...

114
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,445
I'm almost glad that we lost the money.

115
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:53,025
Well, I'm happy you and your
feeling are so well acquainted.

116
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,218
But you wouldn't be the first hostage

117
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:57,377
to fall in love with their captor.

118
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:01,807
I love you very much

119
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,754
Okay. Okay.

120
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:09,471
And I'm here if you need
any help with your speech.

121
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:11,330
No, I'm good, but thank you.

122
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:14,706
Thank you, I needed a
moment of levity today.

123
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,775
- Boop.
- Oh.

124
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:21,265
Woo!

125
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:25,853
Okay.

126
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,112
I think you're very good at this,

127
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:36,204
or the half pill I just took kicked in.

128
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:37,808
Or both.

129
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,068
Because I am feeling
very calm right now.

130
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,831
Well, that's good,

131
00:05:41,856 --> 00:05:43,791
because your neck is
like a block of granite.

132
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:45,583
Okay. Are we sure that's not just muscle

133
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:46,154
Yes.

134
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,790
All right, you answered
that too quickly.

135
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,215
- Relax.
- Mhmm.

136
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:52,076
Take a deep inhale.

137
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,035
And a big exhale.

138
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,661
Good.

139
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,124
Now do that consistently
for the rest of this massage.

140
00:05:58,148 --> 00:05:59,816
Okay.

141
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:02,811
- Can I have you flip on your back?
- Sure.

142
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:08,714
Deep inhale.

143
00:06:10,774 --> 00:06:13,389
Deep breath out.

144
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,283
Ooh.

145
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:18,319
Okay, team, we only have a few hours,

146
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,012
so we need to act fast.

147
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:21,631
- It's raining. What's the plan?

148
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:24,307
Okay. Well, Roland,
you've got some pull here,

149
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:26,400
we need a venue, and don't say...

150
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:29,154
Our living room is yours, Johnny.

151
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:31,464
And we still have some
baby sprinkle decorations

152
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:32,489
gathering dust.

153
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:34,450
Oh, as David's Maid-of-Honor,

154
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:36,343
I'm gonna shut that down on his behalf.

155
00:06:36,368 --> 00:06:38,849
Ray, you don't need
to be documenting this.

156
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:40,900
I was told to capture the day.

157
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:42,702
Ray, I don't think this
is a part of the day

158
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,495
that anybody is gonna wanna remember.

159
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,781
Can you say that again for the camera?

160
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,141
I know the florist.

161
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,536
I can see if she can throw
in some extra flowers.

162
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:55,057
Ronnie, you don't seem to
realize we don't have the time.

163
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,650
Johnny, when I say I
know the florist, I mean,

164
00:06:57,675 --> 00:06:59,559
I know the florist.

165
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:03,123
- Oh.
- Yes! Ronnie! That's great!

166
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:05,371
- Thank you so much.
- I'm doing this for David.

167
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:07,583
Of course you are.

168
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:10,230
I can free up the café between
the lunch and dinner rush.

169
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:12,855
Yeah, I guess we could
use the garage for parking.

170
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,047
We just have to keep a space clear

171
00:07:15,072 --> 00:07:16,715
in case Gwen comes back.

172
00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:19,414
Well, thanks, Bob,

173
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:21,831
but it's really hard to talk parking

174
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:24,176
when we don't even know
where we're holding the thing.

175
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:27,808
Well, the closest place to
there would be the Town Hall.

176
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,318
What about the Town Hall, Johnny?

177
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:33,029
I mean, David's gonna
have a heart attack,

178
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:35,588
but it... it could work.

179
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,663
Okay, David. We've managed
to secure a venue for tonight,

180
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:46,833
and I really don't want to
hear anything but enthusiasm

181
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:48,491
from you when I tell you.

182
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:51,560
You are shockingly calm for David Rose

183
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:53,853
- on his wedding day.
- I am.

184
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,065
So where are we getting married?

185
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,060
- An indoor parking garage?
- Those were all full.

186
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,806
We uh, we managed to get
the Town Hall for the night.

187
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:09,579
And-and it's dry, and
everybody is chipping in,

188
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:10,990
and your dad has promised me

189
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:12,732
that he has everything under control.

190
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,754
- Okay. Fine.
- Are you okay?

191
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,212
I mean, listen,

192
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:22,401
just because I didn't
have the Town Hall...

193
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:25,337
on my mood board doesn't
mean we still can't have fun.

194
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:28,231
And as long as my husband
doesn't stand me up at the altar,

195
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:30,190
I don't care where we get married.

196
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:31,910
Wow.

197
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:33,936
That massage really did a number, huh?

198
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:36,506
- Uh, yeah. That was the first time

199
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:38,966
I've ever received a happy ending.

200
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:41,646
Sorry, what did you just say?

201
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:44,634
The happy ending that
the masseur gave me.

202
00:08:44,944 --> 00:08:46,458
I've always heard of things like that,

203
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:48,051
but I've never actually gotten one.

204
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:49,776
Did you have to pay extra for that?

205
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:53,172
I didn't pay for a happy
ending! I paid for a massage!

206
00:08:53,197 --> 00:08:56,168
He gave you a happy
ending?! On our wedding day?!

207
00:08:56,193 --> 00:08:57,845
I thought you wanted that?!

208
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,595
See, this is what Ray should be filming.

209
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,298
Why... would I want you
to get a happy ending

210
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:04,758
from a stranger on
our wedding day, David?

211
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:06,250
You tell me!

212
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:08,103
Because I was stressed out!

213
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:10,665
And you told me that you
wanted to de-stress me.

214
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,991
I just assumed you knew
what you were paying for!

215
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,093
I was both shocked and impressed!

216
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:16,385
Oh...

217
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,058
Okay, but to be clear, you
didn't stop it from happening?

218
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,562
Okay, Marcia Clark?
Court's adjourned for the day.

219
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:23,186
This is unbelievable.

220
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:25,097
At no point was that ever discussed.

221
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:27,890
All I did, was leave
an envelope full of cash

222
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:30,150
and a note that said to
take very good care of you.

223
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,603
And now that I've said
those words out loud,

224
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:34,240
I can see how a certain kind of person

225
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:36,220
would interpret that the wrong way.

226
00:09:36,245 --> 00:09:38,376
Okay, but was it good at least?

227
00:09:38,414 --> 00:09:41,126
- Do not answer that. Was it? Don't.

228
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:42,418
Okay.

229
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:45,240
I think Stevie and I should
probably go get ready.

230
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:46,932
Leave you to put your little suit on.

231
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:48,524
- Mhmm.
- Okay?

232
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:50,650
Nothing compares to you.

233
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:52,514
My... husband-to-be.

234
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:54,647
I love you.

235
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:57,449
This is gonna make for a
very strange story one day.

236
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,917
Oh yeah, absolutely.

237
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:03,324
Okay. We will meet you at Town Hall.

238
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,184
- Mhmm.
- Okay?

239
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,510
Oh my God.

240
00:10:15,735 --> 00:10:17,436
Ah, everybody,

241
00:10:17,613 --> 00:10:20,315
I'd like to thank you
all for coming out today,

242
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,608
and uh helping to save
David and Patrick's big day.

243
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:26,850
And on a personal note,

244
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:31,025
I'd like to thank you all...
for helping to save my family

245
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,118
over these past few years.

246
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:35,077
I don't think we could
have gotten through

247
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:36,628
without you all...

248
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:39,267
Jocelyn, I thought Ronnie's
in charge of the flowers.

249
00:10:39,468 --> 00:10:41,727
Well, yeah, but you
can never have enough.

250
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:44,005
And you said to spare no expense so.

251
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,300
I did. I didn't think we'd be
taking is it quite so literally.

252
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:49,393
I mean, I think we've
gotta rein this in a bit.

253
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:52,699
Oh Johnny, come on.
Just enjoy it, okay?

254
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:54,258
You're gonna be gone soon.

255
00:10:54,283 --> 00:10:56,117
You're gonna miss this place.

256
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:58,629
I will be back, Roland.
My son still lives here.

257
00:10:58,654 --> 00:11:00,321
No, I know there is that,

258
00:11:00,346 --> 00:11:04,835
but... you are gonna be gone gone soon.

259
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:07,286
Something can fall from
the ceiling and just go

260
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:08,878
Bffggghhh! I'm dead!

261
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:10,203
Okay.

262
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:12,963
- Not me though, I'm prepared.
- All right.

263
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:15,436
Okay, everybody, back to work!

264
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:20,935
***

265
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,256
- Yes!
- Oh!

266
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,108
Oh my God! You're getting married today!

267
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:27,835
I am. And according to
the wedding schedule,

268
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,124
you're supposed to be
dressed and ready to greet me.

269
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,133
Greet you?

270
00:11:32,883 --> 00:11:35,703
- What is that?
- Thank you, David.

271
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,330
You look very expensive
and gorgeous too.

272
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:40,233
It's-it's white. You're
wearing a white dress.

273
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,585
Duh. It's black and white themed.

274
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,211
What was I supposed to show up in pink?

275
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,904
Or black! You're wearing a wedding dress

276
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:49,207
- to my wedding!
- This is not a wedding dress.

277
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:51,163
It's a white, floor-length gown.

278
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:53,350
- It's very different.
- Did it come with a veil?

279
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,374
- No. It came with a headdress.
- A what?

280
00:11:57,432 --> 00:12:00,421
It came with like a
white, tulle, headdress,

281
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:02,046
but I thought it overwhelmed the dress

282
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:03,475
so I decided not to wear it.

283
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,725
You're walking me down the
aisle in a wedding dress.

284
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,241
Everyone is gonna think we're
getting married to each other.

285
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:12,607
Ugh! Come in.

286
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,439
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

287
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,441
Now, Stevie, as my Maid-of-Honor,

288
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:25,917
does it not look like Alexis
is wearing a wedding dress?

289
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,780
Or just like a dress
that happens to be white?

290
00:12:28,805 --> 00:12:30,272
I don't wanna get involved.

291
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:32,042
You don't have a choice.
You work for me today.

292
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:33,901
So much for the massage.

293
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:35,493
I mean,

294
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,766
I don't think it's gonna
look like a wedding dress

295
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,565
unless you guys are
standing next to each other.

296
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:43,330
She's walking me down the aisle!

297
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:46,031
I don't think you should worry about it.

298
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,456
I'm sure this town has
seen far weirder things.

299
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:50,468
Okay. Everybody chill.

300
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,447
My brother is getting married today.

301
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,018
Still feels so weird to say that,

302
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:58,425
so drink up, David.

303
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,893
It's your big day. And we love you.

304
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:04,589
- Right, Stevie?
- Right?

305
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:06,796
Hm.

306
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,476
- Is that a bow in the back?
- Don't, David.

307

329
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:46,830
- You're making me nervous.
- I'm sorry.

330
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:48,542
I've just like, I've been
thinking a lot about it,

331
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:50,067
and I think you're right.

332
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:52,694
I know. About what?

333
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:54,413
Like I think I'm
wearing a wedding dress.

334
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:57,271
- Oh, I know that.
- I really wanted to impress you today.

335
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,190
And now I feel like I'm
ruining your wedding.

341
00:15:12,724 --> 00:15:14,291
before people lose interest?

342
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,763
Hey David,

343
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:19,223
- it would be my honor.
- Okay.

344

Good...

365
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:30,209
Good evening, everyone,

366
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:34,938
welcome to the marriage of
Patrick Brewer and David...

367
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,701
David Rose.

368
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:42,254
We are gathered here today

369
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,825
to celebrate the love
between two people,

370
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:49,252
whose lives were
ostensibly brought together

371
00:16:49,406 --> 00:16:52,375
by the fated flap of a butterfly wing.

372
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:56,592
It is all but impossible to explain

373
00:16:57,053 --> 00:16:59,121
why things happen the way they do.

374
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:05,209
Our lives are like little bébé crows,

375
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,400
carried upon a curious wind.

376
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:12,175
And all we can wish, for our families,

377
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:13,763
for those we love,

378
00:17:14,662 --> 00:17:16,232
is that that wind

379
00:17:16,842 --> 00:17:20,170
will eventually places
us on solid ground.

380
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:26,592
And I believe it's done
just that for my family here.

381
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:28,839
In this little town.

382
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,990
In the middle of nowhere.

383
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:32,606
Okay. I think we're good.

384
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:34,432
Okay.

385
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,951
And now I will ask David Rose

386
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:42,344
- and Patrick...
- Brewer.

387
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:44,137
Brewer.

388
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:48,556
To exchange their vows.

389
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,506
David.

390
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:03,965
I can't believe this is happening.

391
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:07,826
I'm gonna keep this very short

392
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:09,701
because I think you already know

393
00:18:09,726 --> 00:18:11,794
that I would climb a
thousand mountains for you.

394
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:15,877
So I'll just say this:

395
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:20,747
you will always... be a part of me.

396
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,178
♪ And I'm part of you indefinitely ♪

397
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:29,972
♪ Boy don't you know
you can't escape me ♪

398
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:33,974
♪ 'Cause you know you'll
always be my baby ♪

399
00:18:34,563 --> 00:18:36,731
♪ And we'll linger on

400
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:40,349
♪ Time can't erase a
feeling this strong ♪

401
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:44,343
♪ No way you're
never gonna shake me ♪

402
00:18:44,368 --> 00:18:48,060
♪ Ooh darling 'cause
you'll always be my baby ♪

403
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,646
David?

404
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,745
Ugh, yes.

405
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:02,166
Patrick...

406
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:08,185
I've never liked a smile
as much as I like yours.

407
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,684
I've never felt as safe

408
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:12,844
as I do when I'm with you.

409
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:17,392
I've never known love,

410
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:19,638
like I have when we're together.

411
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,474
It's not been an easy road for me.

412
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:27,076
But... knowing that you will
always be there for me

413
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:29,576
at the end of it, makes everything okay.

414
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:34,365
Patrick Brewer,

415
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:37,420
you are my happy ending.

416
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:42,859
Patrick,

417
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,361
do you take David

418
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:48,364
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

419
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:53,636
I do.

420
00:19:55,964 --> 00:19:57,972
And David.

421
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,476
David. Do you take Patrick

422
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:03,333
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

423
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:05,849
I do.

424
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,312
I now pronounce you husband and husband.

425
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:13,958
You may kiss each other.

426
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:40,620
Wooo!

427
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:47,666
Well, you did such a
great job, sweetheart.

428
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:49,359
I don't know how you do it.

429
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:51,351
Oh, someone has to hold it together?

430
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,748
There's a time and
place for sentimentality,

431
00:20:53,773 --> 00:20:57,687
and your only son's wedding
day is hardly the moment.

432
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,826
Moira!

433
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:12,186
- It's 6:00 A.M., John.
I'm moving as fast as I can.

434
00:21:14,953 --> 00:21:16,387
Hmm.

435
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,434
Well, I guess this is it.

436
00:21:19,037 --> 00:21:21,122
You know after our goodbyes last night

437
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,048
Roland mentioned a going away gift,

438
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,208
I guess he forgot.

439
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,373
I personally would not have missed this

440
00:21:28,398 --> 00:21:30,332
for the whole wide world.

441
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:32,358
David: Okay. You're only saying that

442
00:21:32,383 --> 00:21:34,350
'cause you haven't gone to bed yet.

443
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,841
I'm going to miss
you, Mr. and Mrs. Rose.

444
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:40,099
- Oh.
- Thank you, Stevie,

445
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:41,824
that's awfully sweet.

446
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,336
Yes, just as sweet as the liqueur

447
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:45,962
wafting off your breath.

448
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:49,475
I also didn't go to bed last night.

449
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,651
You take care of the place, Stevie.

450
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:58,040
And uh, if you get the chance,

451
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:01,120
Room 7 needs a turndown.

452
00:22:01,317 --> 00:22:02,662
Okay.

453
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,991
Well, safe travels, Mr. and Mrs. Rose.

454
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:07,694
David and I can't wait
to host you at our place

455
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:09,285
when you come back to visit.

456
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,779
Oh, thank you, Patrick.

457
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:15,934
Oh, the couriers are coming
for the bulk of the luggage.

458
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,627
- Yeah, today. Yes.
- This afternoon.

459
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:19,553
Okay. Make sure the
girls are shipped in an...

460
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:22,280
Temperature controlled
cargo container. Aha.

461
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,643
Okay. Bye, kids.

462
00:22:24,668 --> 00:22:26,536
Okay. Bye.

463
00:22:28,488 --> 00:22:29,922
I love you!

464
00:22:29,947 --> 00:22:31,548
Love you.

465
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:36,956
- Okay.
- Love You!

466
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:38,891
- Bye, son.
- I'll see you soon.

467
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:41,284
I'm so proud of us. I'm so proud.

468
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:46,889
- Bye, Honey.
- Bye, Dad.

469
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:50,235
- I love you!
- I love you too.

470
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,622
Moira: We love you!

471
00:23:08,826 --> 00:23:10,213
Love you.

472
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:24,241
Johnny: Wait! Stop the car!

473
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:34,319
What is it?

474
00:23:37,396 --> 00:23:39,378
Just wanted one last look.

475
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,298
Driver, we're ready.

475
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:52,528

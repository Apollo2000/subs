1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,280
It's the last day of
our auditions, Moira.

2
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:04,939
We might have to lower our standards

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,473
if we're gonna find our lead.

4
00:00:06,498 --> 00:00:09,399
Lowering your standards is
a slippery slope, Jocelyn.

5
00:00:09,578 --> 00:00:11,145
Next thing I know you'll be telling me

6
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:12,746
we'll be staging this production

7
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,750
at the school gymnasium.

8
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:18,519
Very dapper, Mr. Rose!

9
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:21,446
Like the maestro of
a Lebanese orchestra.

10
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:23,090
Congratulations Johnny,

11
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:25,168
I never thought I'd
see this little motel

12
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:26,860
recognized for anything,

13
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:29,319
besides the occasional cockroach!

14
00:00:29,344 --> 00:00:32,447
I made myself laugh there.

15
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:35,011
Well, always nice to
be nominated, Jocelyn.

16
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:37,137
But I'm not putting too much stock in...

17
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,129
regional hospitality awards.

18
00:00:39,154 --> 00:00:42,242
The revisions for your acceptance speech
are on the vanity, dear.

19
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:43,734
Oh thank you, sweetheart.

20
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:46,898
So how's the uh, casting hunt going?

21
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:49,031
Oh, disconsolate, John.

22
00:00:49,056 --> 00:00:51,995
We may be looking at putting
an ad in broadwayworld.com.

23
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:54,507
Perhaps there's a
chorus girl on holiday,

24
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:55,617
looking for a leg up.

25
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:56,976
Okay, hi!

26
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:58,828
First of all, I'd like to remind you

27
00:00:58,853 --> 00:01:00,954
that this is a live-work space,

28
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:02,970
and second, fine, I'll do it.

29
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:04,414
Do what, dear?

30
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,440
I'll step in as the
star of your musical.

31
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:07,875
No!

32
00:01:08,343 --> 00:01:11,765
No, with your responsibilities
as our in-house publicist,

33
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,714
I couldn't ask you to do that now.

34
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:15,659
Okay, well, you seem pretty desperate,

35
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:16,984
so I'm happy to help.

36
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:18,638
Well Moira, I'd consider it.

37
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:20,097
I mean, we did spend all that money

38
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,442
flying in Barbara
Streisand's vocal coach

39
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:26,103
that summer Alexis wanted to
be the next Jessica Simpson.

40
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,912
Alexis, a brief stint on a reality show,

41
00:01:28,937 --> 00:01:31,575
that's one thing,
but... acting, that's...

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,653
Um, the producers of
"A Little Bit Alexis"

43
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:35,445
insisted that I take acting classes

44
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,123
after we started shooting, so.

45
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:39,449
Almost makes me want to
try out for it myself.

46
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,552
Okay, now we're all
just getting the sillies.

47
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:45,523
Best we stick to our
award-nominated day jobs.

48
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:47,524
Well, I'm sure that Alexis has a song

49
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,935
that she could sing for the audition.

50
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,228
Audition?

51
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:52,330
Okay, do I have to remind you

52
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:53,955
about the album that I released?

53
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:56,300
Moira, what's the worst that can happen?

54
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,469
Besides the inevitable
accusations of nepotism!

55
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,047
Well, for what it's worth, Alexis,

56
00:02:01,072 --> 00:02:03,006
I always thought "Hampton's Hoes"

57
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:04,665
was quite catchy.

58
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:07,650
Boop!

59
00:02:09,104 --> 00:02:13,908

60
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:18,264
Oh, Stevie.

61
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,823
You look very nice.

62
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,235
- No, I don't.
- Uh, yes, you do!

63
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,529
Very spiffy! That's a lovely dress.

64
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:27,740
I literally pulled it out
of the laundry, Mr. Rose.

65
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:29,433
I've had it forever.

66
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,935
You know it's not a bad thing to admit

67
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,766
you really care about
these awards, Stevie.

68
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:37,298
You're bringing a bag?

69
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:40,167
You know, I almost brought
a change of clothes myself.

70
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:42,055
Moira told me to pack a second suit

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,647
for the after-party, but uh,

72
00:02:43,672 --> 00:02:45,758
who am I, George Clooney?

73
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:47,784
No, Mr. Rose, that's a weekend bag.

74
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:49,744
I'm going away for the weekend.

75
00:02:49,845 --> 00:02:50,845
Oh.

76
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,105
I told you I'm taking Monday off!

77
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:56,150
Yeah, but I didn't know
you were going someplace.

78
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,539
Uh, Emir is presenting at the awards,

79
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:02,399
so I just thought I might
drive around with him

80
00:03:02,424 --> 00:03:04,091
for a few days after.

81
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:08,438
Oh... so it sounds like
you two are getting...

82
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:10,031
pretty serious?

83
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:13,234
Uh, I guess we'll see
what happens this weekend.

84
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:15,412
Hello, guys, uh...

85
00:03:15,437 --> 00:03:17,405
whoa!

86
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:19,006
Look at us! Who are we?

87
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:21,027
Brad Pitt and his handsome brother?

88
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:22,652
And Johnny?

89
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:24,054
Why the jacket, Roland?

90
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,865
You know you're not going to the awards.

91
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,191
Johnny, you asked me to manage the motel

92
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:29,417
while you were away.

93
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:31,128
I'm not gonna show up just dressed

94
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:33,421
like some schlub off the street!

95
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:35,132
Like you do every day?

96
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:37,858
Wow, okay. This one puts on a dress

97
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:39,821
and suddenly she's Rita Rudner.

98
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:42,563
Guys, I am really gonna miss this...

99
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:44,198
workplace banter.

100
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:46,067
- We are coming back, Roland.
- Oh.

101
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:49,270
At least I'm coming back,
I don't know about Stevie.

102
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:51,005
Oh my God, we should really get going.

103
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,174
How about one picture before we go?

104
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,109
Great idea, okay.

105
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,610
Stevie, do you mind?

106
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:57,812
Here we go.

107
00:03:57,913 --> 00:04:00,678
I meant a picture of me and Stevie.

108
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:04,351
Absolutely, no, that
makes perfect sense.

109
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,920
Okay.

110
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,746
And everybody...

111
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:09,699
Put Mr. Rose in it.

112
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:13,359
I just don't get the big
reveal, it's a bathroom.

113
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:15,763
It's not just a bathroom,
David, it's a passion project.

114
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:17,475
I'd kill to be that
passionate about a bathroom

115
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:18,985
that you've now decided to open up

116
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,310
to the entire town.

117
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:22,046
Yeah well, we can't afford
to keep a private bathroom,

118
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,138
David, we're losing
customers to the cafe.

119
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:26,017
Besides, you're the one
who started serving booze

120
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,308
at those evening events.

121
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:29,387
Um, those evening events
are part of a summer series.

122
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:30,878
- Oh...
- We sold 30 dreamcatchers

123
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,713
at that Cosmic Meditation Clinic.

124
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,248
Huh.

125
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,596
Yeah, you know what? You were right.

126
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:40,821
It does look beautiful.

127
00:04:40,922 --> 00:04:42,990
- What the f...
- So, I'm confused.

128
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:44,692
Where does the bathroom start,

129
00:04:44,793 --> 00:04:46,427
and all this garbage end?

130
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:48,329
Ronnie swore this would be done today.

131
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,865
Yep, but you ran out of tiles.

132
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:54,499
It doesn't help that you
picked the most expensive ones.

133
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,204
Okay, you asked for my opinion,

134
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:59,373
I don't know how much
Romanian marble costs!

135
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:01,442
I was hoping to get
my hands on a few more

136
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:04,845
in an hour or so, but
that is TBC at this point.

137
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:07,257
Okay, Ronnie, uh, this installation

138
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:09,150
was just supposed to last two days.

139
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:11,085
And now half of our
store is covered in tarps,

140
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,896
and David's organized
some writers' retreat

141
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:15,556
for tomorrow night. It's
a calligraphy workshop.

142
00:05:15,657 --> 00:05:18,025
We're working as fast as we can,

143
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,067
you have my cell!

144
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:23,274
Could you have not at least
asked her to finesse the tarps?

145
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:25,099
I mean, there's green tape everywhere!

146
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:27,745
The tarps aren't staying up, David.

147
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:29,303
This bathroom's getting finished today,

148
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:30,648
because that's what we discussed,

149
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:32,182
- that's what's gonna happen.
- Okay,

150
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,918
it's just that you waited
until after she left

151
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:35,843
to put your lil' foot
down, so I'm just not sure

152
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:37,173
if she's aware of that plan.

153
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:39,123
She obviously thinks we're
a couple of pushovers.

154
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:40,957
Okay, speak for yourself.

155
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:42,883
All I did was pick
out some gorgeous tile.

156
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,200
I'm pregnant.

157
00:05:48,923 --> 00:05:52,092
That's it, that's the
end of my audition.

158
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:54,638
- Indeed it is.
- I'm fine with nudity.

159
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:56,297
Not necessary.

160
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,831
Thank you.

161
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:02,813
She looks like she may
have seen the inside

162
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:05,406
of a smoky German bar or two.

163
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:07,841
Who knows, a haircut,
some dance lessons...

164
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:09,643
Moira, I feel like we're really scraping

165
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,945
the bottom of the barrel here.

166
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:12,947
I think that we should bring Alexis in.

167
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:16,002
Jabberwocky! There are
still stones left unturned!

168
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:17,827
Okay, you're actively trying to prevent

169
00:06:17,852 --> 00:06:20,263
Alexis from auditioning
here, and I don't want to get

170
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:22,366
in the middle of some mother
daughter competition thing,

171
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,625
Competition! Nothing of the sort.

172
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,504
No, Alexis just doesn't have the...

173
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,296
- life experience.
- Really?

174
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:30,941
Because according to her stories...

175
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:33,571
Well, she's had her fair
share of adventures, yes.

176
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:36,737
But the role of Sally
Bowles requires an actress

177
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:39,506
who can mine a deeper, darker cave.

178
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,842
A woman encumbered
with secrets she will...

179
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:43,920
take with her to the tomb.

180
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,779
Hence the high praise Gina Gershon and I

181
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,681
received for the role.

182
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,250
You know what, Moira?

183
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:50,727
I'm gonna bring Alexis in.

184
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:52,963
And don't worry, I will
handle the audition,

185
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:55,089
so it is less of a struggle for you.

186
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:57,322
Fine, you're on your own.

187
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,729
Boy, it looks like

188
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,074
"Best Customer Service
in a Motel Under 20 Units"

189
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:06,185
is up fifth, that's the big one.

190
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,478
- Okay.
- Yeah.

191
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:11,171
Stevie, if we win, and
I know that's a big "if,"

192
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:14,050
do you think you'll be
doing any talking up there?

193
00:07:14,075 --> 00:07:16,243
- It's all you, Mr. Rose.
- Okay.

194
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:19,256
Excuse me, is this the children's table?

195
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:21,782
Young at heart, maybe.

196
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:24,118
Johnny Rose, but I'm sure
you remember me, Emir,

197
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:26,752
You declared our motel a "must stay".

198
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:28,798
How could I forget, Mr.
Rose, good to see you.

199
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:30,300
And you are?

200
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,636
Uh, I'm just waiting for my date.

201
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,926
So that seat's taken.

202
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,405
Oh, well, can I uh... buy
you a drink while you wait?

203
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,541
I guess, but he won't
be too happy about it.

204
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:39,242
From what I've heard,
he'll take what he can get.

205
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:41,320
- So you're probably safe.
- I should point out,

206
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:43,680
they have been coming
by with drink trays.

207
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:46,173
Oh yeah, we'll just go to the bar.

208
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:49,410
Okay, well, I'm sure you
have some catching up to do.

209
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:56,483
David, look.

210
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:58,886
Ronnie is sitting in
that booth with Roland,

211
00:07:58,987 --> 00:08:00,654
laughing about something.

212
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:02,423
Okay.

213
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,678
She says she's working
as fast as she can.

214
00:08:04,703 --> 00:08:06,036
We don't have a bathroom, David!

215
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:07,194
I'm well aware of that.

216
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:08,796
You know, my uncle's a contractor.

217
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:11,017
I know how this works, you've
gotta stay on top of it,

218
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:13,376
or they will find a million
reasons to just drag it out.

219
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:15,736
Mhmm, well, my ex-best
friend was a crisis manager,

220
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,348
and she told me multiple times,

221
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,207
not to talk to anyone.

222
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:21,775
Especially while they're eating.

223
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,855
So I'm gonna just...

224
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,061
Oh hey, Pat. What are you doing?

225
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:33,554
Playing hooky, or did
the store finally close?

226
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:37,091
I don't laugh a lot, but that was good.

227
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:39,360
That is funny, especially
considering we are open,

228
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:40,741
but hey, who knows for how long?

229
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:42,463
Because right now, it sorta looks like

230
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,131
a quarantine station.

231
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,792
I'm sorry, are you implying something?

232
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:47,000
You know, I'm just saying,

233
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:48,879
uh, the bathroom's
supposed to be done today,

234
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,703
and you say you're
working as fast as you can,

235
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:52,695
but uh, here I find you with Roland.

236
00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:54,675
Okay, FYI.

237
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:56,216
Roland is the hook-up for your tiles.

238
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,745
His cousin, Arnie, gets them at cost.

239
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,973
So I thought I would thank
Roland by buying him lunch.

240
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,977
Because that's how I do business.

241
00:09:06,821 --> 00:09:09,485
Makes sense. I was just sort of uh...

242
00:09:10,243 --> 00:09:11,067
checking in.

243
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,493
I could always cancel the order,

244
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,361
if that's how you wanna do business.

245
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:15,816
Ooh! Ouch.

246
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:17,741
I would run out and
get some aloe Vera pal,

247
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,439
'cause you just got burned.

248
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:22,002
Hi, is everything okay?

249
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:24,062
I don't know, you tell me.

250
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:26,355
Yeah, no, I was just uh,
telling Ronnie what a...

251
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,042
what a great job she's
doing on the bathroom.

252
00:09:29,144 --> 00:09:30,944
And uh, we should get back to the store.

253
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:32,790
Okay, do you still need
to use the restroom?

254
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:35,109
What? Nope! Uh, came here for you.

255
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:37,302
So... we should go.

256
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,121
Thanks for checking in.

257
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:44,015
Is everything okay? You
look more pale than normal.

258
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:47,218
Okay.

259
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:48,996
Hi, my name is Alexis Rose,

260
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,274
represented by Alexis Rose Talent.

261
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,768
Okay, what are you gonna be
singing for us today, Alexis?

262
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:56,970
I have chosen to perform the title track

263
00:09:57,071 --> 00:10:00,250
off of my critically reviewed,
limited reality series,

264
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:01,775
- "A Little Bit Alexis."
- Ooh!

265
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:03,911
Feel free to sing along
if you know the words.

266
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,070
Okay.

- Just wonderful.

284

Okay, yeah, I still actually
had a few more verses.

285
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:58,398
And in the last verse, I
really get to showcase my range.

286
00:10:58,576 --> 00:10:59,776
Oh no, you know what?

287
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:02,721
I think that just that 30 seconds is...

288
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,582
more than enough to go off of, yeah.

289
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:07,107
Are you saying I booked it?

290
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,358
Great question! Jocelyn?

291
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:13,857
Well, we do have to see
all the other candidates.

292
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,217
But we will definitely get back to you.

293
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:19,092
Okay. Okay.

294
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:22,689
Oooh!

295
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:24,749
Oh...

296
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:28,896
So what do we think?

297
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:33,981
Well, there is a place
for her... somewhere.

298
00:11:34,006 --> 00:11:35,702
- On stage?!
- No!

299
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:38,681
Moira, I saw your talent, and I thought,

300
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:41,393
well, the apple can't
fall far from the tree.

301
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:43,419
Different orchard, Jocelyn.

302
00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:45,345
Though I do admire the confidence.

303
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,823
What are we gonna do now?

304
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:49,516
"We?" We are at the precise intersection

305
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,209
of which I tried to steer us clear.

306
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:55,899
No, Babs Streisand's vocal
coach quit the business

307
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:59,412
after just two lessons
with our sweet Alexis.

308
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:02,006
He now lives in a monastery.

309
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:14,782
Wow, it took a while to get the drinks,

310
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:17,452
yet, I don't see any drinks.

311
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,522
Oh uh, we just finished them at the bar.

312
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:21,857
Oh, I see.

313
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,044
Well, you got back at the perfect time.

314
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:27,338
Elmdale Moto Lodge just
won "Best Motel Suite."

315
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:29,631
Coincidentally, the Hospies Committee

316
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:31,510
just had their retreat there last fall.

317
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:34,270
I'm not saying something's up, but uh...

318
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,304
- Okay...
- Our next award...

319
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:38,640
So, what are you doing after this?

320
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:41,295
Oh, well, I happen to have a king suite

321
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,787
at the Elmdale Moto Lodge

322
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:45,113
in exchange for presenting
an award today, so...

323
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:47,057
Well, I did pack a bag.

324
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:48,383
Oh my.

325
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:50,429
Just thought I'd tag along
with you for a few days,

326
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:53,266
you know, tour the best and brightest

327
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,466
in dusty roadside accommodations.

328
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:56,791
Oh!

329
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:58,650
I will be traveling
with royalty, after all.

330
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:02,364
- Getting close,
- Stevie. Stay calm!

331
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:03,745
Wait, I'm sorry, I-I'm not sure

332
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,476
if we're still joking around.

333
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,869
Well, I took Monday off,

334
00:13:07,894 --> 00:13:10,648
and I know you have a few
more motels to hit, so...

335
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:13,208
Oh! Yeah...

336
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,568
no, that would be fine.

337
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:17,178
That would be fine?

338
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,720
That's the kind of reaction you want.

339
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:20,415
No, I'm sorry, sorry, I just, I...

340
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:21,727
you just caught me a little off guard.

341
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:23,262
I just wanna make sure that we're still

342
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:25,820
- on the same page here.
- Yeah, totally.

343
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:27,989
Yeah... good, good, okay.

344
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,344
'cause you know, I thought
this was just something great

345
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:32,603
that happened when it happened.

346
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:34,296
- It is.
- Stevie!

347
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:37,241
I mean, you know, I'm
on the road so much,

348
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:38,633
and you've got the motel to run,

349
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,574
I don't see any of that
changing any time soon.

350
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:43,738
Okay.

351
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,974
But what if it could change?

352
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:51,146
I'm sorry, I-I don't see that
happening for either of us.

353
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,217
Oh.

354
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:54,959
The winner is...

355
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,094
Rosebud Motel.

356
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,020
Oh! Yessssss!

357
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:01,198
Stevie, we did it!

358
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:03,650
Oh my God!

359
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:05,460
Ohhhh!

360
00:14:07,153 --> 00:14:08,322
Stevie!

361
00:14:08,872 --> 00:14:10,840
Look at her, she's stunned!

362
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:19,308
Um...

363
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:22,820
- Hey!
- Hey!

364
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:24,179
You're home.

365
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:26,090
I was just gonna leave
you that little note

366
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,455
and a box of chocolates.

367
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:30,828
I got the part, didn't I?

368
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:32,730
Come in, come in!

369
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,491
Ohhh...

370
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:38,059
Yay! Nom nom!

371
00:14:38,236 --> 00:14:39,837
I now see that there are different ways

372
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:42,597
to interpret chocolates.

373
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:45,000
Alexis, I just wanted to say...

374
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,877
Am I hearing Jocelyn?

375
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:49,004
Yeah, she's come to
tell me the good news!

376
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:50,729
Oh, did she?

377
00:14:50,906 --> 00:14:53,641
Chocolates? Are we celebrating, Jocelyn?

378
00:14:53,743 --> 00:14:56,011
The chocolates were a mistake.

379
00:14:56,112 --> 00:15:00,057
Alexis, after very
careful consideration,

380
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:04,562
I've decided that you are
overqualified for the role.

381
00:15:04,663 --> 00:15:06,597
I know, but I'm totally fine with that.

382
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:09,758
And I really value you
as our in-house publicist.

383
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,218
Jocelyn, no. Oh, we can
see where this is going.

384
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:15,773
Part of me thinks that
maybe we should give the role

385
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:18,166
to somebody who really needs it.

386
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:20,044
Oh Alexis, I wanted to fight for you,

387
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:22,642
but I had to recuse
myself as your Mummy!

388
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,839
Okay, um...

389
00:15:24,864 --> 00:15:26,541
Who did you pick?

390
00:15:26,918 --> 00:15:28,852
We're still looking.

391
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:32,713
So you picked no one over me?

392
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,517
That would be a Jocelyn question.

393
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:41,499
Maybe there's a better role for you.

394
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
What's better than the lead?

395
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:45,119
Yes, I'm curious about that as well.

396
00:15:45,704 --> 00:15:48,272
Kit Kat Club Dancer Number Six!

397
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:50,231
- Hah!
- Sorry?

398
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:51,966
She doesn't have a lot of lines,

399
00:15:52,144 --> 00:15:53,878
but she has a very sexy costume,

400
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:55,804
and a lot of face time on stage,

401
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,115
- which I know that you love...
- I love both of those things.

402
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,707
Okay, um...

403
00:15:59,732 --> 00:16:01,499
would that require
like, another audition?

404
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:03,044
No, no!

405
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:05,822
No, the part is yours.

406
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,969
Jocelyn, how wonderfully generous of us.

407
00:16:08,994 --> 00:16:10,294
Okay.

408
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,664
Well, I'm guess I'll have to
put you in touch with my agent.

409
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:15,366
But I think you already have her number.

410
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,926
And we'll get going on negotiations!

411
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:20,635
I would have my agent
accept that offer, dear.

412
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,330
Yes.

413
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,899
Thank you.

414
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:27,478
Woo! How 'bout that, partner, huh?

415
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:29,571
Not bad for a couple of years' work.

416
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:31,806
Hey trust me, I'm just
as shocked as you are.

417
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,343
But this is ours, and no
one can take it from us.

418
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:37,155
Sorry, Sir, uh, I'm
gonna need to take that

419
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,613
for the next category.

420
00:16:38,713 --> 00:16:40,458
We'll be mailing yours
in six to eight weeks,

421
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:41,983
along with the bill. Okay, great.

422
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,284
Yeah, okay.

423
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:45,038
Well, that's probably for the best,

424
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:47,164
I mean, I don't wanna be
lugging that thing around

425
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:48,957
- to all the after-parties.
- Mhmm.

426
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:51,659
So, Stevie, I thought we'd go for a...

427
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,794
celebratory dinner, huh?

428
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:54,455
Yeah.

429
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,914
Unless that steps on
your plans with Emir?

430
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,967
Nope, there's no more plans anymore,

431
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:01,615
so, whatever you wanna do.

432
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:04,591
Your weekend plans got pushed, or... ?

433
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:05,950
Uh no, just canceled.

434
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:07,785
It was a stupid idea anyways.

435
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,911
I don't know what I was thinking.

436
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:14,983
Okay, well, you know what,

437
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:16,718
if it's okay with you,

438
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,577
why don't we beat the
traffic, and just...

439
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:21,322
just head home, 'cause
I gotta be honest, I'm...

440
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,068
I'm feeling awfully tired, actually.

441
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:26,494
Mr. Rose, I know how
important this is to you.

442
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,388
Oh Stevie, we got what we came for.

443
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:31,809
Well, we didn't actually
get it, they took it back.

444
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,577
I mean, what kind of
cheap-ass award show

445
00:17:33,602 --> 00:17:34,988
takes back an award?!

446
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,248
Mr. Rose, I don't think
I can go back out there.

447
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:39,416
Well, tell you what, you stay here,

448
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:41,509
I'll grab your bag, and maybe...

449
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,144
a few shrimp for the road?

450
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:44,889
Yeah, thanks.

451
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:53,145
I don't regret what I did.

452
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,133
Well, look who it is.

453
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,969
Ronnie, we want to apologize

454
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,962
for the miscommunication this afternoon.

455
00:18:00,987 --> 00:18:02,154
We?

456
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:03,513
What's that?

457
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:07,053
This is just a, an expression
of our continued appreciation.

458
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,081
I don't see any of that
blue cheese in here.

459
00:18:11,428 --> 00:18:13,017
David, did you put
any of the blue cheese

460
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,309
in there for Ronnie?

461
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:16,086
That cheese was very expensive.

462
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:18,046
We'd be happy to run some over.

463
00:18:18,071 --> 00:18:22,040
So what would be the
update on the tiles, then?

464
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:24,045
Funny you should ask.

465
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,955
I was just heading out to run them over.

466
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:28,256
- Ah!
- Hmm.

467
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:30,001
So I wonder if you still
need the basket, then.

468
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,759
Oh, I still need the basket.

469
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,405
So uh, does this mean
that the whole project

470
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:34,929
could be wrapped up then, by tonight?

471
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,899
Did I just say that I
was heading out right now?

472
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,001
- Yes, she did!
- She did, great.

473
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:41,812
Uh so, should we just jump in with you?

474
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,581
I don't think so.

475
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:45,440
What about just me then, Ronnie?

476
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:50,578
This went well...

477
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:52,113
I think. Yeah.

478
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:15,944
Well, hello, you!

479
00:19:16,045 --> 00:19:17,913
Mrs. Rose, what are you doing here?

480
00:19:18,014 --> 00:19:21,250
I thought you and I might
celebrate your big award!

481
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:22,751
Come in.

482
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:26,722
Oh, thank you.

483
00:19:27,757 --> 00:19:31,586
And I was made aware
there was a loss, as well.

484
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:34,048
Yeah.

485
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,174
Turns out, someone who's
been working the front desk

486
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:39,266
of a motel her whole life
isn't exactly a turn-on.

487
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:42,638
I was speaking of his loss.

488
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,517
Stevie, underneath the
brambly tartan blousant

489
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:47,409
is a chrysalis,

490
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:50,236
just bursting with potential.

491
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:54,268
Well, I'm glad somebody thinks so.

492
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,028
Yes, perhaps she just needs a...

493
00:19:57,053 --> 00:19:59,547
bit of a shock to her daily routine.

494
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,467
That's kind of what I
was going for, Mrs. Rose.

495
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,403
Well, the kind of shock
I'm referring to, Stevie,

496
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:06,862
will not come in the form of a man.

497
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:10,332
What is this?

498
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:12,701
Oh, just a gift that once jolted me out

499
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:15,061
of my little Podunk routine.

500
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,916
Me, in front of people?

501
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:20,008
I am not an actor.

502
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,268
And neither is the lead in the play.

503
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:26,124
She's simply a headstrong young woman,

504
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,226
who's been knocked about a few times,

505
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:31,954
and... looking to make
the most of herself.

506
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:34,466
Did Mr. Rose put you up to this?

507
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:36,959
No, this inspired
piece of stunt-casting

508
00:20:36,984 --> 00:20:39,094
was an idea all my own.

509
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,764
And we can't find anyone else.

510
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,244
- Thank you...
- You're welcome.

511
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:47,803
I should've led with this.

512
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:49,495
Please tell me you can sing.

513
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,683
I sing in the car.

514
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,141
Good enough.

515
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:55,377
Okay. Peruse.

516
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:56,712
At your leisure.

517
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:58,881
Okay.

518
00:20:58,982 --> 00:21:01,201
Oh, I see you've opened
a bottle of wine already,

519
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,928
I won't burden you with another.

520
00:21:03,953 --> 00:21:05,454
Bye.

521
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,211
Bye.

it's always to go under than over.

160
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:37,250
Yeah, I don't know if that's true, son.

161
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:40,030
Every Rose video we
opened had fireworks.

162
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:41,833
Day or night. People love pizazz.

163
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,921
Okay, well, this is gonna
be the opposite of that.

164
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:46,421
We're inviting a select group of VIP's,

165
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:50,327
and offering a 25 percent
friends and family discount.

166
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:53,053
- Well, that sounds meek.
- Okay.

167
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:56,139
Friends are getting the same discount
as family? That doesn't sound right.

168
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:57,350
Well, that's what we're doing.

169
00:06:57,356 --> 00:06:59,843
Well, what if your mother and I
go in and buy something together?

170
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:02,444
Does that mean we get
a 50 percent discount?

171
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:06,257
Why would you wanna spend
less money at my store?

172
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:11,062
David, we are happy to support this
modest little vigil you're hosting

173
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:12,648
but to hand out discounts

174
00:07:12,654 --> 00:07:14,265
before the store has even birthed

175
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:17,048
it sounds a tad defeatist.

176
00:07:17,054 --> 00:07:19,712
I hope you don't mind if I
keep this information to myself.

177
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:22,142
I don't want you to share the news.

178
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:23,947
The smaller the better.

179
00:07:23,953 --> 00:07:26,751
Oh, rarely has that been
a recipe for success.

180
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:28,620
I'm really glad I came in here.

181
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:33,641
- We love you!
- Keep reaching, son!

182
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:35,917
(light knock)

183
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:38,354
Hello.

184
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,257
Um, I called Mrs. Syzlak,
and sorted it all out.

185
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:43,052
She will be in tomorrow.

186
00:07:43,058 --> 00:07:45,177
So, I'm just gonna go back to my desk,

187
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:47,246
which is where I work.

188
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:51,064
Uh, we should talk about the kiss.

189
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,367
Definitely.

190
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:55,572
Personally, I don't think
it was that a big deal.

191
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:56,846
Yeah. Neither do I.

192
00:07:56,852 --> 00:08:00,939
We're adults. We should be allowed to
have an adult kiss from time to time.

193
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:03,109
- Totally. An adult kiss.
- Yes!

194
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:07,146
Like when parents kiss their
friends... ju... on the mouth.

195
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,805
Yes. Like kissing your parents.

196
00:08:09,811 --> 00:08:12,273
That's exactly what I was gonna say.

197
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,099
Yeah. I mean, we're friends so...

198
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:16,302
Agreed. (chuckles)

199
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,700
Oh! Here's something,
speaking of friend stuff,

200
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:23,084
um... David is doing this
friends and family discount

201
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,381
for his store opening.

202
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,006
And I know that you love discounts,

203
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:28,818
so, I was thinking that
maybe we could go...

204
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:31,121
- Yeah. That sounds... yeah.
- As friends.

205
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:34,358
I would go as family, and
you would go as friends...

206
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:35,564
of the family.

207
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,825
Well, I do love discounts. (chuckles)

208
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:40,855
In fact they had to delete
Groupon from my phone last week,

209
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:44,745
just 'cause three vacuums
is enough... vacuums.

210
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:47,438
Yeah. Cool. Okay.

211
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,632
So um...

212
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,415
back to work-o.

213
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:54,621
- Watch out! Oh.
- (light thud) Oh! Ow.

214
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,550
♪

215
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:06,627
- Oh my God.
- Isn't it something?

216
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,566
Huh? (chuckles)

217
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,111
I always felt something
was missing in here

218
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,855
and then it occurred to me that...

219
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:14,832
a lot of family-run businesses

220
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:17,518
hang a portrait of the
family in the workplace.

221
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,820
Oh. Well, that reminds me,

222
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:24,319
I've been meaning to have my
family portrait airlifted in...

223
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:26,320
Well, I know it's a
little arresting at first,

224
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:28,381
but I think with time

225
00:09:28,387 --> 00:09:30,102
you won't even know it's here.

226
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,296
Mm... I don't think that's gonna happen.

227
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,196
You don't look very happy in this.

228
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,153
Well, it wasn't the style to look happy.

229
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,778
The motivation was to look successful.

230
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:46,669
You know this used to hang in
the great hall of our house.

231
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:49,456
Oh, now this seems a little
understated for a great hall.

232
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:51,455
I'd look at it every morning.

233
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,571
The family often wasn't
all together back then,

234
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:58,079
but, uh, I could look at
this and there we were.

235
00:09:58,478 --> 00:10:02,274
Well, you guys are together,
like, all the time now,

236
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,998
so, who needs this,

237
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,995
- right?
- Well, that's true.

238
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:10,883
But, this happens to be one
of the only possessions that...

239
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,655
wasn't sold off.

240
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:16,054
Really? You'd think
there'd be more of a market

241
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,962
for oversized paintings
of other people's families.

242
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:28,317
Why does it seem like Mrs.
Roses eyes are... following me?

243
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:30,399
Oh, she paid extra for that.

244
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:38,271
- TWYLA: Here you go.
- _

245
00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:40,470
- Two tuna melts.
- Oh. I didn't order tuna melts,

246
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:43,962
- but I don't have time to...
- Oh, by the way, I hope you don't mind,

247
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:46,677
but I told a few people
about your big store opening.

248
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:48,888
Big store opening?

249
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:51,062
Isn't it a friends and family sale.

250
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:52,774
Yes.

251
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:58,269
Which is why you would
be invited as a friend.

252
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:02,158
- Um, who told you about our little...
- David,

253
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,493
just the guy I wanted to see.

254
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:07,569
Listen, uh, Gwen wanted me to ask you

255
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:10,795
Er, if... if we both have
plus-ones for the opening,

256
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:13,700
or do we have to be
each other's plus-ones.

257
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,208
Who's Gwen?

258
00:11:15,214 --> 00:11:18,597
(laughs)

259
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,253
That's very funny.

260
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:23,527
Oh, my mother's boyfriend
wanted to bring his secretary.

261
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:25,020
He did?

262
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:28,231
Why not. Um, I'm gonna go.

263
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:31,532
But I'm really glad
that someone told you....

264
00:11:31,538 --> 00:11:35,126
um... and Bob... and Gwen.

265
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:38,665
(car rumbles)

266
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:40,535
(footsteps thud)

267
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,935
(door creaks open)

268
00:11:42,637 --> 00:11:44,073
Uh...

269
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:47,942
how many people did
you tell about Friday?

270
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:50,034
Just the names on my
pre-approved list. Why?

271
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:52,831
Uh, because I have been
approached by a lot of people

272
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,869
who are not on the pre-approved list.

273
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,338
Well, you know, sometimes when you
tell everyone that it's exclusive,

274
00:11:58,344 --> 00:12:00,243
then everybody just wants in.

275
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:01,932
Like how many people
are we talking about?

276
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:05,759
Uh, I don't know. Twyla's
whole family. So, like, 75?

277
00:12:05,765 --> 00:12:06,884
(inhaling whistle)

278
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,205
- Should've ordered more food and wine.
- Uh...

279
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:11,585
Well, looks like this soft
launch is firming up a bit, huh.

280
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:13,238
But it's not supposed to be firm.

281
00:12:13,244 --> 00:12:16,113
Well, with this many people it's
definitely at least semi-firm.

282
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:18,121
Okay. Well, as long
as it doesn't get hard.

283
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:21,442
And that's something, that's
what I just said to you, so...

284
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:27,848
What...?

285
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:31,282
(quietly excited laughter and chatter)

286
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:34,554
Oh my God.

287
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:37,994
Hey, back of the line, bro!

288
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,674
Hey! No cutting!

289
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,165
'Scuse me, this is
my store. Who are you?

290
00:12:42,171 --> 00:12:44,587
I'm Darleen's cousin.
Who the fuck are you?

291
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:46,394
My God. Ah...

292
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,077
That kind of language, folks,

293
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,284
will not be tolerated
at Rose Apothecary.

294
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:52,751
Thank you.

295
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:55,299
- This is a safe place.
- _

296
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:57,445
(doors creak open and shut)

297
00:12:57,451 --> 00:13:00,698
Uh, so I was just verbally assaulted

298
00:13:00,704 --> 00:13:04,446
by a very off-brand
customer in line outside.

299
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:07,796
Well, David, I have
really underestimated you.

300
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:09,243
How so?

301
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:11,037
Who knew you had so many friends,

302
00:13:11,043 --> 00:13:12,532
or, uh, family members,

303
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:14,533
- for that matter.
- Okay. What do we do?

304
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,453
- I for one blame Gwyneth. Um...
- David, relax.

305
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:19,913
It's going to be fine.

306
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:24,166
Oh my God, the lights! I
didn't call the electrician.

307
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:25,443
- (light clicks on)
- Do...

308
00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:27,789
Watched a lot of YouTube tutorials.

309
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:30,505
This is very impressive.

310
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:33,072
Well, there is a good chance
I didn't wire that properly,

311
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,980
so that's why I also got the
insurance that you forgot to get.

312
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:39,174
M'kay. Um, there's only so
much that I can do in a day.

313
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,034
- Mm.
- So... um...

314
00:13:41,783 --> 00:13:43,611
Are we ready to do this?

315
00:13:43,617 --> 00:13:44,931
Open the doors.

I can't believe it.

331
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:21,507
He's managed to create, in this
town, something truly winsome.

332
00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:24,005
I would shop here, John.

333
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:27,129
Even without a nagging
sense of obligation.

334

the labels on everything.

00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:33,783
- (Moira gasps)
- 'Rose Apothecary.'

336
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:38,245
The Rose name on another
plucky young business.

337
00:14:39,444 --> 00:14:41,361
We should go congratulate him.

338
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:42,949
We should but...

339
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:45,335
our son is very hard at work.

340
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:53,717
Doing it. Here you go.

341
00:14:53,723 --> 00:14:56,410
And the scarf. Is this
*** wearing it, is it?

342
00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:59,620
So um, this says foot cream on it.

343
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:01,550
What happens if I use it on my hand?

344
00:15:01,556 --> 00:15:05,262
Um, I'm pretty sure your
hands are gonna be fine.

345
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:07,110
Okay, and it's like 50 percent off

346
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:09,401
if Jocelyn and I both
buy it at the same time?

347
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:11,880
Um, n-no. Have you
been talking to my dad

348
00:15:11,886 --> 00:15:14,682
- about the discount?
- Roly, you can bargain later.

349
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:17,353
Um, David, I need to
ask ya a little question

350
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,861
about this baggy of Joshua tree tea?

351
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:22,376
- Sure.
- Is it drugs?

352
00:15:23,235 --> 00:15:26,632
Uh, no. It's loose leaf tea.

353
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:29,524
Okay. Because it smells exactly like...

354
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,223
Oh, come on! Ah, wow!

355
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:35,959
Geez, I didn't realize
this place was a front.

356
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:37,465
It's not a front.

357
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,564
That is a tea that Mr. Hockley makes
out of a greenhouse on his farm.

358
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,338
And now that I've said it out
loud, I might have to double check.

359
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:48,880
Hmm. Well, honey, why don't we, um,
grab a few bags of Mr. Hockley's...

360
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:51,384
- tea. (laughs)
- Go get 'em. I love tea. (laughs)

361
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,994
ROLY: Yeah, I'm a big tea drinker now.

362
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,313

I also, I don't know.

- Big news?
- ALEXIS: Um...

well, it wasn't that big a deal,

Ted and I went to hug...

what to do with the portrait.

Oh, it's still there,
waiting for us. Isn't it?

I was thinking, to save space,

391
00:17:13,923 --> 00:17:15,965
we could cut our faces out

392
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:19,509
and make four smaller,
individual portraits.

No. We can't go down that road, Moira.

pencil shaped like a twig.

Wasn't that was sneaky of you.

Yeah, it's a lot more
expensive than I thought, too.

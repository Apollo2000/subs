1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:02,150
Well, this is a big moment

2
00:00:02,226 --> 00:00:05,085
in the expansion
of Rosebud Motel Group.

3
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:09,182
Today we cut the ribbon
on a new Rosebud Motel.

4
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:11,141
Can I take my blindfold off
now?

5
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:14,263
Oh, not yet, honey, we gotta
wait for Johnny's big reveal.

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,717
- Okay.
- Let's get to it,

7
00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:17,116
let's cut the ribbon.

8
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:18,268
- Roland.
- Okay.

9
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:19,557
- Wanna hold that? Stevie,
- Yeah.

10
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:21,343
- you wanna hold this, hold it up?
- Mr. Rose, do we really need

11
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:23,215
- to do this.
- Yeah, yes, yes we do.

12
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:24,615
Moira, scissors.

13
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,156
Hey, how about a drum roll,
Stevie?

14
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:27,836
- I'd rather not.
- Yeah, you know what,

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,434
I'm just gonna take off
the blindfold.

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,818
Okay. Moira, scissors please.

17
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,488
Okay, what are these?
These won't cut a ribbon.

18
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:38,360
They're cuticle shears, John.

19
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:41,972
Do you expect hedge clippers
to be drawn from my purse?

20
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:43,713
Okay, alright,

21
00:00:43,797 --> 00:00:45,889
hold it up and hold it taut
please.

22
00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:47,804
I'm sorry, taut?

23
00:00:47,888 --> 00:00:49,630
What is that, old English?

24
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:51,618
How bout I hold it tight?

25
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:52,889
Mr. Rose, just cut the ribbon.

26
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:54,175
- Pull it, pull it.
- Okay.

27
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:55,692
- Here we go. Okay.
- Cut it.

28
00:00:55,777 --> 00:00:57,260
How long is this gonna take,
Johnny,

29
00:00:57,463 --> 00:00:59,076
should I cancel my New Year's
plans?

30
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,781
Okay, you know what,
just drop the ribbon, drop it.

31
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:03,161
- Alright.
- Yay.

32
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:06,490
Okay, step one now complete,

33
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:07,899
onto step two.

34
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,251
- And what would that entail?
- Deep cleaning the rooms.

35
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:14,178
Well, I'd like to be put
to use, what's step three?

36
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:16,050
You know, I think I need
to lie down,

37
00:01:16,134 --> 00:01:18,226
that blindfold was quite taut.

38
00:01:18,485 --> 00:01:21,133

40
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,658
That's me in front
of a volcano.

41
00:01:25,743 --> 00:01:26,747
Yeah.

42
00:01:27,014 --> 00:01:31,008
In the jungle,
in outer space,

43
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,502
that's another volcano.

44
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:34,285
As maid of honour,
I pick the second volcano.

45
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:36,633
Okay, you are hanging onto
that job by a thread.

46
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:38,725
Ray, do you have anything
that'll make us look

47
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:40,107
a little less like the kind
of couple

48
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:41,457
that gets married
at a theme park?

49
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,285
Oh, I think what David
is trying to say

50
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,463
is maybe something
a little simpler.

51
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:45,716
Yeah I'm looking
for understated,

52
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,112
Annie Leibowitz
for Vanity Fair.

53
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:48,991
I want us to look like
two very rich people

54
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,688
that have just woken up
after fainting

55
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:52,141
- on a dusty old couch.
- Mmm.

56
00:01:52,226 --> 00:01:54,083
I don't know if you've
thought about wedding favours,

57
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:56,417
but might I suggest
mouse pads,

58
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:58,689
I got thousands downstairs.

59
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:00,263
Let me get you some samples.

60
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:01,435
Wonderful.

61
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:05,007
Okay, as maid of honour,
I have to say...

62
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,443
You don't have to say
anything.

63
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,619
Anyway, I thought
it would be festive

64
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:11,361
if I got you a little
pre-wedding gift.

65
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:12,667
- What?
- Mhmm.

66
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:15,539
I am sending you
to get pampered

67
00:02:15,623 --> 00:02:18,379
- before this afternoon's shoot.
- Do I get pampered?

68
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:20,196
No, you get to drive him
to the spa

69
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,155
where he will indulge
in a relaxing

70
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,305
five minute scalp massage

71
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,984
followed by some light sun.

72
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:27,132
That'll also give me
enough time

73
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:28,770
to art direct this situation

74
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:30,641
'cause clearly Ray wouldn't
know my aesthetic

75
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:33,301
- if it ran him over.
- I'm sorry, did you say sun?

76
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:36,386
Yeah, like a,
a kiss on the cheeks,

77
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,132
uh, um a gentle spray.

78
00:02:38,556 --> 00:02:40,174
Okay, well, thanks for
the gift, David,

79
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:41,580
but no thank you.
I'll take it.

80
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:43,928
Actually sounds less like
a gift and more like a chore.

81
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:45,723
Okay, I am doing you a favour.

82
00:02:45,808 --> 00:02:46,541
- Oh.
- Okay.

83
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:48,909
Stevie, take our photo please
for a moment, fast please.

84
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,272
- Ooh, uh.
- Okay.

85
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:55,575
Yeah, see, side by side my
Mediterranean complexion

86
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,451
makes you look
a little anemic

87
00:02:57,535 --> 00:02:59,192
so the spray will
just even it out.

88
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:02,119
Okay, it's not that...
bad.

89
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:04,414
Okay, well, the lighting
is not good so. I mean...

90
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:05,850
- Hmm.
- Just as an example,

91
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:08,454
here is a sample mouse pad
that Jocelyn made

92
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:10,079
for the computer lab
at school.

93
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:14,217
The Under the Sea theme is only
available during winter months.

95

My God, Ted,
what are you doing here?

96
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,442
I wanted to surprise you.

97
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:35,663
- Oh my God, okay, babe, hi.
- Hi, hi.

98
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:37,708
- Hmm.
- Hm.

99
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:40,145
Hi, uh sorry there
were limited options

100
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,712
at the airport gift shop.

101
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:44,712
"Have a great flight",
so sweet.

102
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,152
You're here in the flesh.

103
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:49,545
Hm, I missed you so much.

104
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,660
Um, who's babysitting
the turtles?

105
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:53,376
Well, I am a part of a team
of 30

106
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,248
so they let me take
the long weekend off.

107
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:57,730
The long weekend?
It's Sunday, it's over.

108
00:03:57,815 --> 00:04:00,216
Yeah, I know, I was supposed
to get here yesterday morning

109
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:02,283
but my first connecting
flight was delayed

110
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:05,341
and then I got food poisoning
from some bad milk

111
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:06,476
on my second connecting flight.

112
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,996
Ew Ted, they made you drink
milk on the airplane?

113
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:11,754
No I actually ordered it,
and in my defense,

114
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,668
they were serving cookies, so.

115
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,933
Okay, so um, how long do
we actually have then?

116
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:18,880
Just today.

117
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:20,055
Oh my God.

118
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:22,144
Okay. Then enough about
the milk thing

119
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,494
even though I have like
50 more questions about it.

120
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:26,322
Yeah, yeah,
no need to milk it.

121
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:28,585
Ooh, we definitely
don't have time for that.

122
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,414
No I just, I just wanna be
with you and catch up and talk.

123
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:33,741
Okay, so my parents are out
and David's at the store

124
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:36,722
so maybe we can just like be
with each other right now,

125
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:38,288
and then later if we feel
like it we can talk.

126
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:39,379
- Yeah, but I...
- You're not still sick,

127
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:40,819
- are you?
- No I just.

128
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:41,892
Okay.

129
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:45,515
Yeah. Okay, we can do this
first.

130
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,206
Boy, I look at this place,
untouched from the 60s.

131
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,296
These motels were a gold mine,
Roland,

132
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:55,916
all they need is a little
dusting.

133
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:58,775
And bleach, lots of bleach.

134
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:00,500
You know, there are boutique
hotels

135
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:03,052
that would kill for this level
of authenticity.

136
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,607
I'm thinking of turning
this place

137
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:06,610
into the Presidential Suite

138
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:08,613
and charging a premium for it.

139
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:11,291
I'm reminded John of Shanghai

140
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:13,497
and our Party Secretary Suite

141
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:15,151
with its own aquarium,

142
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:18,859
I'd lay in a claw foot tub
watching the orcas.

143
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,457
- Joc.
- And we're back.

144
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:22,938
You know that staycation
we've been talking about?

145
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:24,669
Why don't we just do that here?

146
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:26,388
Well, Roland, that-that
sounds good,

147
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:28,434
but uh, that just can't happen.

148
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,339
As a new business owner
it's dangerous

149
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:33,343
to treat your assets
as personal possessions.

150
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:34,654
That's my John.

151
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:37,433
At Rose Video, he made me
purchase the blue-ray

152
00:05:37,518 --> 00:05:40,916
of my gritty feminist police
drama, "Miranda Rights".

153
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,787
I rented that three times.

154
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:45,050
Miranda is so sassy
when she went undercover

155
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:47,008
for that wet T-shirt contest.

156
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:49,185
Hey, the sooner we get this
place guest ready,

157
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:51,883
the sooner we can start
making a profit.

158
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:54,103
Yeah. Well,
that sounds good to me.

159
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,675
Bob's been charging us
a fortune to babysit.

160
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,504
Speaking of which,
we should get going.

161
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:01,160
Bob has his first cry therapy
session tonight.

162
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:02,285
Okay.

163
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:04,327
Bye.

164
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:08,378
Well, if that isn't team work,
I don't know what is.

165
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:11,076
Ah, I know, the room looks
pretty good, huh?

166
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,426
No I'm, I'm talking about
the way you and I,

167
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,080
threw them off the fragrance

168
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:17,256
so that we could keep this
suite to ourselves.

169
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,215
No that's not what
I was doing, Moira.

170
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:21,477
No, it's very important
at this stage

171
00:06:21,562 --> 00:06:23,784
to keep the bar set very high
for Roland.

172
00:06:23,868 --> 00:06:25,460
- John.
- Now I just told them

173
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:27,289
they couldn't stay here.

174
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:28,915
Oh, be careful, John,

175
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,574
lest you suffer vertigo
from the dizzying heights

176
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,313
of your moral ground.

177
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:46,214
Are you sure this is
what you want, David?

178
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:48,126
This looks like someone
put a tarp over

179
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:49,607
their living room furniture.

180
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:52,228
Yeah, I'm going for an English
estate in the offseason.

181
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:53,610
Okay, it's just uh,

182
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:55,183
do you really want these photos
to say

183
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:57,996
my relationship is an old
estate in the offseason?

184
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:00,824
Why don't I show you
the county fair backdrop,

185
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:05,003
I think a Ferris wheel would
look so cute on a mouse pad.

186
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:06,929
I don't think we're gonna do
the mouse pads.

187
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:11,745
- Oh hi.
- Hi.

188
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,618
- Why do you look...?
- Hot?

189
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:16,207
Oh, I got a spray tan.

190
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:17,714
Patrick gave you his
appointment, didn't he?

191
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:20,282
No, I just put mine on your
credit card.

192
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:22,894
Okay, well that's fraud
and you're a criminal

193
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,765
so where even is my life
partner?

194
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:27,110
He's coming.

195
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:31,591
I think he spent maybe a second
too long in there.

196
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:39,417
Are you happy now, David?
Is this what you wanted?

197
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:42,564
- You look...
- I look like a cheese puff.

198
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,484
Okay, you said it, not me.

199
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:46,724
Um what, uh, what ha,
what happened?

200
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,831
Did they use the Allez Vous
bronzer on you?

201
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,799
I don't know, David,
they asked me what I wanted,

202
00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:52,852
I told them just to give me
what you usually get.

203
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:54,209
Well, why would you do that?

204
00:07:54,294 --> 00:07:56,518
I'm practically Sicilian,
you don't need that much sun.

205
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:57,854
I don't know how it works,
David.

206
00:07:57,938 --> 00:07:59,682
Well, couldn't find it.

207
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:03,611
Oh, hi Patrick, I almost
didn't recognize you,

208
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:04,700
you look like one of those
people

209
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:05,907
who has that skin condition

210
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:07,019
from eating one too many
carrots.

211
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:08,429
- Okay.
- You know what?

212
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:10,475
I can't be in photos like this
so I'm going to uh,

213
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,535
- I'm gonna go.
- No, no, no, no,

214
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,480
we've got this all set up,

215
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,579
- you'll barely notice it.
- Oh.

216
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,429
And that's what photoshop's
for,

217
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:19,982
- just to lighten it up a bit.
- Yes,

218
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,391
just have fun with it.

219
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:23,849
- Yes, have fun.
- Okay, Patrick,

220
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:26,098
I'm gonna have to ask you
to smile a little more.

221
00:08:26,183 --> 00:08:27,759
I think this is probably
as good as it's gonna get

222
00:08:27,843 --> 00:08:29,320
- right now, Ray.
- Okay, okay, okay.

223
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:32,855
Okay, here's what
I'm thinking,

224
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,021
we do that like three
to four more times,

225
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:37,197
and then we go on a romantic
walk to your house

226
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:39,939
and we like hang out there
for a little bit.

227
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:43,442
Yeah um, that plan sounds
really active, Alexis.

228
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,157
- Mhmm.
- But uh my mom's staying

229
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:46,467
at my place and uh,

230
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:49,877
I'd rather not walk in on her
and her zumba instructor,

231
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:53,314
don't wanna have to zoom
back here.

232
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,451
Is everything okay?

233
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:57,783
It's okay to admit
that I tuckered you out.

234
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,003
No it's, it's not that.

235
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:01,874
Okay, then what is it?

236
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,703
I just thought that it was
important

237
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:06,780
that we have this conversation
in person.

238
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,381
You're starting to sound like
me trying to end things

239
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,123
with B-Rock on the Backstreet
Boys Millennium Tour.

240
00:09:12,962 --> 00:09:14,895
Ted, you're not like trying
to break up with me, are you?

241
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:16,371
No I'm not breaking up
with you.

242
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,565
Oh okay, thank God.
So what is it?

243
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:21,779
I got offered a job.

244
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,554
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

245
00:09:24,655 --> 00:09:27,668
- Is it a bad job?
- No it's a great job,

246
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:30,721
they wanna make me a permanent
part of the research team

247
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,902
in the Galapagos.

248
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:36,566
Okay, define permanent.

249
00:09:37,146 --> 00:09:38,895
It's a three year contract.

250
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:41,842
Okay, that's a long time.

251
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:44,029
Yeah, I just,
I keep waiting for things

252
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:45,875
to get easier for us.

253
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:48,747
So um, what are you gonna
tell them?

254
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,105
I, I don't know,

255
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,224
I mean I had three plane rides
to think about it and,

256
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:56,233
and I wanted to have a solution
by the time I got here,

257
00:09:56,317 --> 00:09:58,754
but seeing you,

258
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,463
I don't wanna lose this.

259
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:05,024
Okay, so what do we,
what do we do?

260
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:07,461
Do I like move to
the Galapagos?

261
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,594
Or I move back here.

262
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:11,711
And turn down your dream job.

263
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:16,342
Okay, this just got like
very heavy.

264
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,243
I feel like I'm sweating,

265
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,205
I also feel like very cold.

266
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,347
Yeah. I, I took the weekend
because I want us to have

267
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:25,513
a few days to talk about it,
but then...

268
00:10:25,598 --> 00:10:27,267
Yeah, no, the milk, I know.

269
00:10:28,953 --> 00:10:31,567
Um, Ted, I think I'm gonna need
a minute.

270
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,096
You know that I can't make big
decisions under pressure,

271
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,674
that's how I ended up
with a pixie cut at prom.

272
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:40,685
There has to be a way
through this.

273
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:45,269
I liked this a whole lot more
before we started talking.

274
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:55,577
Moira, what's going on
in there?

275
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:58,501
Oh! It's my hands, John,
it's the water,

276
00:10:58,586 --> 00:11:00,153
it's freezing cold.

277
00:11:00,238 --> 00:11:02,019
Well, then move your hands.

278
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:03,542
How will I know
if it's getting warmer

279
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:05,414
if I'm not touching it?

280
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,829
Well Moira, you've got
the cold tap on,

281
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:10,419
you've gotta balance it
with the hot.

282
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:11,745
Oh.

283
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:14,635
Well, I'm sorry I'm not an
alchemist, John,

284
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:16,512
and it's not like there's
a his sink

285
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:18,427
for when the hers
is inoperable.

286
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,602
Okay, Moira.

287
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:22,261
Excuse me while I try
to pass through.

288
00:11:22,372 --> 00:11:24,624
Oh John, these door frames,

289
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,615
it's like trying
to force oneself

290
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,372
through the eye of a needle.

291
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,012
I think uh, the point's been
made, Moira.

292
00:11:33,097 --> 00:11:36,928
Oh, so you're willing to
reconsider a room upgrade?

293
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:38,496
- Upgrade?
- Mhmm.

294
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:39,804
Oh, I thought you were
talking about

295
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:41,414
a romantic weekend.

296
00:11:41,587 --> 00:11:44,174
We start with a weekend
and go from there.

297
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:46,830
You don't believe we deserve
this perquisite, John,

298
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:49,894
at least until we secure
a way out of here.

299
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:52,535
Moira, yeah,
the room is bigger,

300
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,196
it might even be nicer,
but haven't we managed

301
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,200
to make due here in this room
over the past few years?

302
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:01,074
Yes, in the same way road
crustations are known

303
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,512
to make due in old soda cans.

304
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:04,972
And what about the kids?

305
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,844
We're just going
to abandon them here?

306
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:08,804
They're practically
middle-aged

307
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:11,019
and they're not denying
theirselves betterment,

308
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:13,848
why should we?

309
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,652
Alright, maybe it is good
business practice

310
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,024
to sample the product
before selling.

311
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:22,411
Well, whatever you think
is best, Mr. Rose.

312
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:25,364
I've packed your weekender,
it's in the car.

313
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,868
See, these are good,
we could use any of these.

314
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,472
David, those are just ones
where you look good.

315
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:36,787
Well...

316
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,731
only took me nine showers
to still look like this.

317
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,212
See, this is good,

318
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:42,805
this is how you were
supposed to look.

319
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,955
Oh, well then if that's
all it took

320
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,118
should we just head
back to Ray's?

321
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:47,445
I don't know,
do you think he'd have time?

322
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:49,404
No, I was being very,
very sarcastic.

323
00:12:50,044 --> 00:12:51,875
- Oh.
- Are there any usable shots?

324
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,442
- Umm.
- Umm.

325
00:12:53,526 --> 00:12:55,694
None of the ones where you
can see your face or hands,

326
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:58,011
- There's a few I think that...
- but we're still looking.

327
00:12:58,095 --> 00:12:59,622
- Might be good.
- Cool,

328
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:01,276
so I guess my relatives
will just have to imagine

329
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,147
what the person I'm marrying
looks like

330
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:05,062
and how happy I am to be
with him, and...

331
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:07,020
Okay fine, ooh,

332
00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:09,284
maybe we just open up
the guest list a bit

333
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:12,069
and invite a few more
of your distant relatives,

334
00:13:12,153 --> 00:13:14,158
or I do have head shots
from my pageant days

335
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:15,812
that I could mail out to them.

336
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:18,510
David, can we just agree
to stop making this wedding

337
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:20,019
a bigger deal than it needs
to be.

338
00:13:20,104 --> 00:13:21,814
We are not these people.
Okay.

339
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,905
Well, this is a teachable
moment for all of us.

340
00:13:25,427 --> 00:13:28,172
You know, look at his tan,
looks great,

341
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:29,347
the lighting's right,

342
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:32,351
maybe Stevie should take
a few candid shots

343
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,179
- and see what happens.
- You're insane.

344
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:37,094
- David... no.
- No I'm not.

345
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:39,401
We are looking for photos
and here we are.

346
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,270
Oh my God.

347
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:44,318
Okay, well the tan
does look good.

348
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:46,235
- Ooh see.
- Okay fine,

349
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,064
like maybe a couple more
but then that's it.

350
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:49,371
Okay fine, alright.

351
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:52,849
- What is your hand?
- Oh that's weird.

352
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,416
Huh?

353
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:01,153
Hey Alexis, I haven't seen
you running in a while.

354
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:02,138
Thanks, Twy.

355
00:14:02,223 --> 00:14:04,656
Yeah, I just needed to get out
and clear my head.

356
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:06,602
Is everything okay?

357
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,240
I don't know.

358
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,547
Okay, do you think
a smoothie might help?

359
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:12,874
No, I think I'll just
take a smoothie.

360
00:14:13,377 --> 00:14:17,059
Okay, I'll just be right
over there if you need me.

361
00:14:21,842 --> 00:14:22,859
Oh hi,

362
00:14:24,287 --> 00:14:25,370
Ted.

363
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:26,564
Um... Alexis.

364
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:29,624
I know, without sounding
too forward,

365
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,729
I've seen you around...

366
00:14:31,814 --> 00:14:33,993
And uh, you know,
I have to say,

367
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:36,178
I think that you are the most
beautiful girl

368
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:37,471
this town's ever seen.

369
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,664
Alexis, Alexis,

370
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:43,524
here's your smoothie.

371
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,643
Twy, do you ever have those
days where you wonder

372
00:14:48,728 --> 00:14:50,093
why things just
can't be easier?

373
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:52,430
Why, what's going on?

374
00:14:53,011 --> 00:14:54,650
Ted got a job.

375
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:56,657
- Another one?
- No, the same one.

376
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:59,280
He got offered the same job
he already has?

377
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:03,276
No, same job, they just
want him to stay longer,

378
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:05,682
like forever.

379
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,799
Oh.

380
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:11,947
Yeah, so it's like
what now?

381
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,643
Do I leave everything behind

382
00:15:14,728 --> 00:15:16,403
and move to some random island

383
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:18,039
to be with the love of my life?

384
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:20,303
'Cause I did that with Harry
Styles in England,

385
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,531
it was like too rainy.

386
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:25,060
That is hard.

387
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:28,486
I feel like now's the point
where you... normally

388
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:31,081
have some surprisingly
helpful advice.

389
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:33,768
I know you, Alexis,

390
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:36,503
and you always make
the right decision.

391
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:39,175
- Hm.
- Eventually.

392
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:43,115
Thanks, Twy.

393
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:04,590
There he is,
my ginchi hotelier.

394
00:16:04,675 --> 00:16:06,419
How does it feel
to be President

395
00:16:06,503 --> 00:16:08,135
in the Presidential Suite?

396
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,448
Well, uh,

397
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,206
let me say this
about that, Moira,

398
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,993
Uh, if not now, when,

399
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:17,341
if not us, who.

400
00:16:17,514 --> 00:16:20,433
- Are you alright, John?
- Oh, it's my JFK,

401
00:16:20,543 --> 00:16:22,087
just playing into the theme.

402
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:25,742
Best to leave the voice work
to me when setting a mood.

403
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:34,313
Yeah, so I must admit,
Sweetheart,

404
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:36,997
I could get used to this.

405
00:16:37,185 --> 00:16:39,357
I'm going to run a bath,
John.

406
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:42,324
Well, if I close my eyes
I can almost hear

407
00:16:42,408 --> 00:16:44,500
the orcas calling to be fed

408
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:46,064
or freed.

409
00:16:47,143 --> 00:16:49,817
- Oh.
- Jocelyn, Roland.

410
00:16:49,902 --> 00:16:53,166
Johnny, Moira.

411
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:54,400
What's going on here?

412
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:56,098
Uh, nothing, nothing.

413
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,771
No we were uh,

414
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,049
just uh,

415
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:02,966
Doing a final polish
on the uh, on the room.

416
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:04,621
Uh-huh.

417
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,997
Oh, I guess martinis work
better than wax, huh?

418
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:11,047
Johnny, wasn't it you who said

419
00:17:11,132 --> 00:17:13,223
it was dangerous to treat
your assets

420
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:14,603
like personal possessions?

421
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:17,651
And what may I ask are you
two doing back here?

422
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:20,023
I told you we would
get caught, Roly.

423
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:21,270
Well...

424
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:22,429
if you must know,

425
00:17:22,514 --> 00:17:25,868
Jocelyn and I had been renting
our extra bedroom

426
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:28,536
to uh, help pay for this place.

427
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,672
Yeah, and so we thought
there's nobody here,

428
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:32,548
it might be nice
to have a weekend

429
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:34,942
where a total stranger
wasn't making themselves

430
00:17:35,026 --> 00:17:36,335
at home in my kitchen.

431
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:37,556
Okay, look Roland,

432
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:41,513
I may have been a bit too much
of a stickler earlier.

433
00:17:41,598 --> 00:17:44,473
Ah no, no it's fine,
Johnny, we'll just uh,

434
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:46,388
we'll just sleep in the truck
with the baby.

435
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:48,173
Or you know what,

436
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:50,349
you could give us the keys
to your place,

437
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,046
it would be like wife swap

438
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,656
except we wouldn't be swapping
wives,

439
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,529
- we'd be swapping mattresses.
- Okay, you can take the room.

440
00:17:56,613 --> 00:17:57,451
It's not gonna happen.

441
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,893
- Oh thank you, guys.
- Okay. Great, thank you.

442
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,418
I've never stayed in
a Presidential Suite.

443
00:18:02,503 --> 00:18:03,710
Enjoy it, Honey,

444
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:05,731
this one uh reminds me
a lot of the uh,

445
00:18:05,816 --> 00:18:08,703
suites in uh Cuba
before Castro took over.

446
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:11,417
- That's not, that's not JFK.
- Yes, it's JFK,

447
00:18:11,502 --> 00:18:13,629
- Ask a not what your country
- he's always...

448
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:15,153
- can do for you.
- Who said that?

449
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,428
- The man's from Boston.
- <i>John!</i> - He didn't say, no he's not,

450
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:19,232
- he's from Upstate New York.
- Coming Moira

451
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,948
And FDR said that.

452
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,721
What is all this?

453
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,463
Sit.

454
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:47,822
Did you close down
the whole café?

455
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:49,772
More like I politely
but forcefully

456
00:18:49,857 --> 00:18:51,903
asked everyone to leave.

457
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:54,780
So the set menu for tonight

458
00:18:54,873 --> 00:18:57,460
is mozzarella sticks,
four cheese lasagne,

459
00:18:57,545 --> 00:18:59,312
and a blueberry cheesecake
for dessert.

460
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:00,949
Huh,

461
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:03,972
that's a lot of dairy.

462
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:06,444
All of your cheat day
favourites.

463
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:09,780
Also, I may have forgotten
about the whole milk situation.

464
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:12,593
Well, I appreciate
the gesture, Alexis.

465
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:17,158
So I feel like there's
an elephant in the room

466
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:20,438
and... I skipped the class
that taught us how to...

467
00:19:20,565 --> 00:19:21,684
..care for large mammals

468
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:23,329
and I don't know how
to get it to leave.

469
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,814
You can't move back here,
Ted,

470
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,946
you've just been offered
the job of your dreams

471
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:30,821
and there's no turning back now.

472
00:19:31,497 --> 00:19:34,262
And just think of all those
gross little flies

473
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:36,890
that are still out there
for you to discover.

474
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:39,860
Actually, those flies are an
invaluable piece of the puzzle

475
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,143
in the study of evolution,

476
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:44,660
but... yes we do have our fingers
crossed that there are

477
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:46,766
still a few more out there.

478
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:50,421
What about you,

479
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:51,850
what are you gonna do?

480
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,327
This might come as a shock
to you, Ted,

481
00:19:55,412 --> 00:19:58,342
but I can't move
to the Galapagos.

482
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:00,597
I wouldn't let you even
if you tried.

483
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:04,292
You're building something
special here, Alexis,

484
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:06,379
and you deserve to see
where it takes you.

485
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,386
I'm so proud of you.

486
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:12,298
I'm so proud of you.

487
00:20:13,674 --> 00:20:16,241
I'd like to think that 
we helped each other get here.

488
00:20:17,207 --> 00:20:18,561
I know that we did.

489
00:20:18,725 --> 00:20:20,857
And when you get on
that plane tomorrow

490
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,612
I want you to know
how grateful I am

491
00:20:24,697 --> 00:20:26,093
to have met you.

492
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:27,626
I don't think I'm ever gonna
meet another woman

493
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,541
who made me feel the way
that you do.

494
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:33,323
I'm sure there'll be like

495
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,634
some other woman,

496
00:20:36,477 --> 00:20:37,867
somewhere.

497
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:42,680
Can't say that we didn't try.

498
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:45,907
I love you, Ted.

499
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,307
I love you too.

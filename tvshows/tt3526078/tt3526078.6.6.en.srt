1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:01,356
Oh...

2
00:00:01,441 --> 00:00:04,784
Okay, if you think you've
lived through a bad day,

3
00:00:04,869 --> 00:00:06,790
try being our next guest.

4
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:09,485
When she showed up to a
screening of her new film,

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,618
"The Crows Have Eyes:
The Crowening..."

6
00:00:11,702 --> 00:00:13,900
- Fun name!
- It is!

7
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:18,190
So, the last thing she expected
was an actual crow attack!

8
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:20,921
Oh...

9
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:24,562
Well, now we're being told
that the whole thing

10
00:00:24,647 --> 00:00:27,479
was a PR stunt
put out by the movie.

11
00:00:27,564 --> 00:00:29,482
Now, is that clever or what?

12
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,205
It sure is!
We are so very lucky

13
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,978
to be joined this morning
by Moira Rose.

14
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:36,273
- Well, ach!
- Ach!

15
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:38,799
- What a ride this has been!
- Yes.

16
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:40,982
What a ride indeed, Barb!

17
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:43,225
Oh, let me first assure
your viewers

18
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,069
that... not a single crow
was harmed,

19
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:47,261
and as for the humans,

20
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:49,779
oh, nothing but a little
wounded pride...

21
00:00:49,985 --> 00:00:51,812
and one severed earlobe.

22
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:53,474
- Oh!
- Ouch!

23
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:55,620
- Yeah!
- Yes, everything you saw

24
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:57,509
was part of a carefully
orchestrated,

25
00:00:57,594 --> 00:00:59,729
entirely deliberate stunt.

26
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:02,368
Oh, well, it seems
to have worked, Moira.

27
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:04,988
With over more than
2 million views

28
00:01:05,073 --> 00:01:07,165
in less than 24 hours,

29
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:10,901
this video has created an
incredible buzz for the movie,

30
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:13,245
which, as of right now,

31
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:16,461
is officially trending
on Interflix.

32
00:01:16,546 --> 00:01:17,688
It is?!

33
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:20,353
Well, if you're saying
it's a smash hit,

34
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:23,292
then I'm just going to have
to take your word for it.

35
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,431
As well as the word
of millions of streamers

36
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:27,520
across the internet, I suppose.

37
00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:29,927
You know, the brilliant thing
about being on streaming

38
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:32,826
is that one can start
the movie at any point,

39
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:34,436
any time they like.

40
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:36,962
You know, Moira,
I think it's safe to say

41
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:38,531
you are officially back

42
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:40,335
- in the game! -
- Yes!

43
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,154
Well, you heard it here
first!

44
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,227
Do not adjust your sets!

45
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:46,881
Excuse me, but I'd be remiss

46
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:50,328
if I didn't acknowledge
my daughter, Alexis Rose.

47
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:55,497
This whole PR coup d'état never
would've happened without her.

48
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,119
Honestly, we just had fun
with it.

49
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:58,232
Can't hear you.

50
00:01:58,317 --> 00:01:59,758
Poor dear's not mic'd.

51
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:02,249
Well, looks like
there's no stopping you two now!

52
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:03,990
Congratulations!
Hmhm.

53
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,999
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

54

56
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:16,097
Gentlemen. Morning.

57
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:19,133
I believe you've met
my roommate, Bob.

58
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:21,295
- Roommate?
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:21,877 --> 00:02:23,362
Yeah.
Uh, Ronnie's been nice enough

60
00:02:23,446 --> 00:02:24,929
to let me stay in her
guest room,

61
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:26,593
ever since Gwen...

62
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:29,095
took the house.

63
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:32,853
Yeah. And as much as I'm
enjoying the slumber party,

64
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,929
I really think that Bob could
use a change of scenery.

65
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:38,293
Maybe he could crash here
for a night...

66
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,903
or six?

67
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:42,394
- Uh, yeah...
- I don't think we, uh,

68
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,913
we have any clean rooms
available.

69
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,388
Oh, I... I don't mind
a dirty room.

70
00:02:47,473 --> 00:02:50,936
I hope that doesn't sound
as sad as...

71
00:02:51,102 --> 00:02:52,698
as it feels.

72
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:55,155
Bob, why,
why don't you take a seat?

73
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,568
And grab some water
while you're at it,

74
00:02:57,653 --> 00:03:01,051
'cause you should really
hydrate after all that crying.

75
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:03,472
Gwen used to love water.

76
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:13,067
Okay, I feel badly for Bob,

77
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,492
but it's not a good look

78
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:16,644
to have him wallowing
around here.

79
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,594
Well, where do you
want the guy to wallow?

80
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:21,206
I mean, Johnny,
there's plenty of sad people

81
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,659
staying at this motel.

82
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,951
That's not exactly how I'd
describe our guests, Roland.

83
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:27,734
Well, I'm just saying,
maybe he could meet

84
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:29,572
a fellow wallower here?

85
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:32,084
Oh, it'd be really nice
if Bob could meet somebody

86
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:33,083
'cause from what I hear,

87
00:03:33,168 --> 00:03:35,340
Gwen isn't exactly sitting
at home.

88
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:37,213
Or, what if...

89
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,495
we take Bob out for the evening

90
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:43,022
and kind of act
as his wingmen

91
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,431
Johnny, you know,
the whole dating scene

92
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,773
has kind of changed a little
since you were single.

93
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:50,127
First off,
we now have electricity.

94
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:54,923
Okay, all right,
are you in or not?

95
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,241
Ooh, I'm in. 'Cause I don't
wanna miss a chance

96
00:03:57,326 --> 00:03:59,241
to see how this plays out.

97
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,644
- Bob?
- Well, it... it would be so nice

98
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:07,207
to not be completely alone
for a night.

99
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:08,731
Uh, lucky Gwen,

100
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,489
she has another one of her
male cousins visiting.

101
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:18,457
- This coffee's delicious.
- Thank you.

102
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,786
Yeah, it's... it's sort of
burning my hand a bit

103
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:23,257
because I can't put it down
on anything.

104
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:25,927
David, you know that the new
coffee table is coming today,

105
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:27,825
and that it takes a little bit
longer

106
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,604
- when it's handmade.
- Handmade, yeah.

107
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:31,104
You know what I think
you should do?

108
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:32,789
Just come over here
and relax for a bit.

109
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:34,672
Sit down, we could put our...

110
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:36,233
our feet up on the...

111
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,708
You happy now?

112
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,224
Just do me a favour
and watch these,

113
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:42,845
- and don't eat them.
- Mm. No guarantees.

114
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:45,564
- Hey.
- Hey.

115
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:47,790
- Coffee table for Patrick?
- That's me, yeah.

116
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,187
You look super familiar.

117
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:50,507
Have we ordered
from you before?

118
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,928
Uh, I don't know.
I... I get a lot of orders.

119
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,885
- Do you mind if I uh...?
- Yeah, come on in.

120
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:58,062
- Uh, it's just right there.
- Yeah.

121
00:04:58,388 --> 00:04:59,903
'Kay.

122
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:07,415
I'm sorry, this is who made
your table?

123
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,638
- David!
- Hi.

124
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:10,721
- What're you doing here?
- Okay. Muah.

125
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:12,254
Wow.
We're still doing that.

126
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:15,113
Uh, this is my boyfriend's
place.

127
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:16,303
- Fiancé.
- Fiancé.

128
00:05:16,388 --> 00:05:19,165
Yeah. Now I remember where
we met before.

129
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,489
- Stevie's apartment.
- At Stevie's.

130
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:23,106
Bingo. I'm sorry
for not remembering.

131
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:24,716
- I meet a lot of people.
- Mm.

132
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:26,800
That is a great sweater,
by the way.

133
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:28,903
- It really brings out your lips.
- Okay.

134
00:05:29,102 --> 00:05:32,590
Well, thank you
for the coffee table.

135
00:05:32,675 --> 00:05:33,949
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

136
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,218
I am also wearing
a sweater.

137
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:38,692
A lot of sweat
went into this one.

138
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:42,782
- This is one of my best pieces.
- You got great taste.

139
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,611
And from the looks of it,
so does David.

140
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:46,946
Okay.
I'm gonna go uh...

141
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:47,890
you know,
I'm gonna check on the...

142
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:49,184
- Perfect! Yeah.
- Pancakes.

143
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:51,903
Say, you know what?
I was just planning on having

144
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:53,873
a chill night in,
but if you guys are free,

145
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,825
I'd love for you to come by
for a whiskey or...

146
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,387
- Hm. O-kay.
- Whatever.

147
00:05:58,495 --> 00:05:59,681
You know...

148
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:02,128
You know what? We'll,
we'll think about that for a sec

149
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:03,937
- and see, and see.
- Great!

150
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:06,115
- Hope to see you tonight.
- Okay.

151
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,728
And for what it's worth,

152
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:09,807
you guys make a beautiful
couple.

153
00:06:09,892 --> 00:06:11,248
Thank you so much.

154
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:20,051
- What?
- No, you're just, your face

155
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,692
is all red.
It's beet red.

156
00:06:21,777 --> 00:06:23,736
- It is not!
- Mm-hmm. It's flush.

157
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:27,476
- Hey, babe!
- Hey, babe!

158
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,433
Oh my God! Where are you?
Is that the ocean?

159
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:32,168
I wish. It's a poster
of the ocean.

160
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:34,432
'Cause I'm actually in
Stewart's dorm room right now

161
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:36,806
because mine got evacuated
last night...

162
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:39,159
small fire ants issue.

163
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:41,336
Yikes!
Hope everything's okay.

164
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:44,357
It was a real "Fyre Fest."

165
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:47,412
You do not wanna see
Krista's ankles today.

166
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:49,036
<i>But, it's all good.</i>

167
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:50,507
<i>We'll be getting our dorms
back in...</i>

168
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:51,979
<i>better shape than
we left 'em.</i>

169
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:54,142
- <i>Can't wait. Hm.</i>
- Let's talk about you!

170
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:55,984
<i>Everyone here has been watching
your video!</i>

171
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:57,463
<i>And to think
it was all fake?</i>

172
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,492
Totally fake.
Isn't that wild?

173
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:03,115
And all of these PR agencies
from New York are calling

174
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,358
to ask me
how I did it.

175
00:07:04,443 --> 00:07:05,773
How did you do it?

176
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,863
Um, it's like a little bit
too complicated

177
00:07:07,948 --> 00:07:10,258
- to explain over this.
- Hi, Theodore!

178
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:11,708
Gorgeous view!

179
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:13,639
Hi, Mrs. Rose!
Congrats on the movie!

180
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,167
That last scene where you
leap from your nest

181
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:17,635
only to discover that
your wings

182
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,311
- aren't developed enough yet...
- Oh, you're too kind.

183
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:22,870
The Daily Mail called it
a "flap for the ages!"

184
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:24,897
Okay, can I have my boyfriend
back now, please?

185
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:26,203
Hm.

186
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,867
Oh!

187
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:30,191
It's Buzzfeed calling
about the 10 goriest

188
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:32,049
Clara Mandrake accidents
from the film.

189
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:33,699
Best we take it.

190
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:35,702
And don't forget,
we have a conference call

191
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:38,747
with the Interflix PR people
in a tight 15.

192
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:39,809
- Okay.
- <i>Wow,</i>

193
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,494
it seems like you've got
a lot going on, Alexis.

194
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:43,345
Yes, but not too much
for you.

195
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:44,784
No,
don't worry about me,

196
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:47,056
you're obviously in high
demand.

197
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:48,718
Alexis! They're asking
about co-stars.

198
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,547
I can't be expected to remember
everyone I meet!

199
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:54,160
Mm. Okay, okay.
Well, I guess I do have to go,

200
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:55,423
but I will see you
in a few days

201
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:56,549
and I can't wait!

202
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:58,417
- I can't wait either.
- Alexis!

203
00:07:58,501 --> 00:07:59,940
Okay, I'm coming.
Ugh!

204
00:08:00,035 --> 00:08:01,606
- Okay, love you!
- Love you...

205
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,246
Ooh!

206
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:10,063
I don't think we're the same
size, Johnny.

207
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:13,379
I might have a trouble fitting
tissues into these pockets.

208
00:08:13,464 --> 00:08:14,937
Oh, you won't need tissues.

209
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:16,498
There'll be no crying tonight,
Bob.

210
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:18,448
You look like
a million bucks.

211
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:20,681
Well, actually, Bob,
in Johnny's suit there,

212
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,515
you look like a guy
who had a million bucks,

213
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:25,602
Very funny, Roland.

214
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:27,379
Now,
the suit works, Bob.

215
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:30,269
Bob, in my experience,

216
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:32,384
it doesn't matter
what you wear.

217
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:34,516
It's all about being yourself.

218
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,909
I think the last person

219
00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:37,737
Bob wants to be right now
is himself.

220
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:39,110
I agree with Roland.

221
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,558
I don't know if I can speak
on behalf of women here...

222
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:42,839
You can't.

223
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:45,266
Moira used to say,
when she was single,

224
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,050
she would always be attracted
to men

225
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:48,922
who could make her laugh.

226
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:50,539
How'd she end up
with you?

227
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:54,143
All right, why don't we try
a little test run here.

228
00:08:54,228 --> 00:08:56,856
Let's imagine
we're in a bar.

229
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:59,454
Ronnie, do you wanna be the
woman in this little scenario?

230
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,554
- Not a chance.
- Okay. Mm!

231
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:05,416
Move over. I...
will be the woman.

232
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,201
Okay.
So we're in a bar

233
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:10,422
and, uh, you see this very
intriguing looking gentleman.

234
00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:12,407
Okay.

235
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,881
Hello, I'm...

236
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,914
- I'm Gwen.
- Oh...

237
00:09:17,178 --> 00:09:18,821
- You had to pick Gwen?
- I'm sorry,

238
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:20,404
I saw Bob standing there

239
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:22,044
and that was the first name
I thought of.

240
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,345
- They're always together.
- Okay. Hold it together.

241
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,946
- Pick another name!
- Okay, all right.

242
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,424
Uh... okay, yeah.

243
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:31,733
Hi. I'm Ronnie.

244
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:33,403
- That's my friend Gwen.
- Oh...

245
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:35,160
Okay, this is a disaster.

246
00:09:35,245 --> 00:09:37,209
Thank you, Roland.
I'll take over from here.

247
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:38,825
Bob, honestly,

248
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,610
You know,
just a few runs and...

249
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:43,021
you're gonna be drowning
in phone numbers.

250
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:45,212
No. No...

251
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:48,319
I... I can't breathe.

252
00:09:48,591 --> 00:09:50,331
Ooh.

253
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:54,960
You know what?
Jake did a great job with this.

254
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:56,796
Mm-hmm.
I was just about to say

255
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,440
this coffee table really
brings out your lips.

256
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:01,462
Okay, what? I can't
compliment the guy?

257
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:04,361
He's talented. You know, he's
like a, a one-man operation.

258
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:05,942
Not in my experience.

259
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:07,609
And I think it was
very nice of him

260
00:10:07,693 --> 00:10:09,176
to invite us
for drinks tonight.

261
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,265
- Wasn't it?
- Yes, it was. It was very nice

262
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:12,892
and I think that we should
get back to him about it.

263
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:16,182
About going to his place
for "a whiskey or whatever"?

264
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:17,967
David, I'm fine to have
drinks

265
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,274
- with one of your exes, okay?
- Okay, first of all,

266
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:22,777
Jake is nobody's ex
and everybody's ex.

267
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:25,661
And second of all,
going to Jake's for a drink

268
00:10:25,746 --> 00:10:28,500
is never just going
to Jake's for a drink.

269
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:30,531
Oh... oh. So you...

270
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:33,505
okay, so you think he invited
us over to... to...?

271
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:36,054
- Yes, I do. Yeah.
- Yeah.

272
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,923
Well, in that case,
we definitely shouldn't go.

273
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:40,199
'Cause we're not really
the kind of couple that...

274
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:42,226
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah...

275
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:44,516
That being said,

276
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:46,471
if we ever did decide to...

277
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,391
have "a whiskey" with someone,

278
00:10:50,622 --> 00:10:52,769
Jake would be the person
to do that with

279
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:55,294
because he literally doesn't
care about anything.

280
00:10:55,431 --> 00:10:56,859
So just...

281
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,322
I'm just throwing it out there.

282
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:02,414
I mean, we always have
the option of going

283
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:04,669
and just having a whiskey.

284
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:07,404
Okay. And I always have
the option of online shopping

285
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:09,454
and just putting things
in the cart.

286
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:11,452
That's not gonna happen.

287
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:16,069
Um... what's all this?

288
00:11:16,324 --> 00:11:17,952
They just keep coming.

289
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:19,846
Well, congratulations.

290
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:21,553
That must mean everyone's
happy.

291
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:23,163
Oh, very happy, yes.

292
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,836
Thanks to your little attack
of the corvidae,

293
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:28,919
we are Interflix's number one
stream of the day.

294
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:30,644
Tied only with the fourth
season

295
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:31,998
of "Caroline in the City."

296
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:33,960
From Interflix.

297
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,438
"To Alexis,

298
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:39,796
congratulations and thank you.

299
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:42,503
The competition is eating
crow."

300
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:45,220
"Love, your new best friends
at Interflix."

301
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:48,751
They're all for you.

302
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:52,802
Not those - those are from
Joyce Dewitt.

303
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:54,689
I didn't want to overwhelm you,
dear,

304
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:57,224
I know you're being pulled
in another direction.

305
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:01,417
Though, you might find a bit
more delectation in this.

306
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:04,335
No, I do. I... I just like
haven't received flowers

307
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,098
from someone I wasn't...
friends with.

308
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:10,209
What do I do?

309
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:11,960
What do you want to do?

310
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:13,884
I can't leave now.

311
00:12:13,969 --> 00:12:15,258
If you're worried
about the flowers,

312
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:16,701
they'll likely be dead
in a week.

313
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:18,261
Yeah, like my career
if I walk away

314
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:20,267
with everything that's
going on.

315
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:22,152
I've already made Ted wait
an extra month.

316
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:24,652
I can't... back out now.

317
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:27,813
So you...
you weigh your options.

318
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:29,753
On the one hand,
you are perched

319
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:32,104
on the precipice
of a dream come true

320
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:36,020
and you can jump knowing,
possibly for the first time,

321
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,883
that you can succeed
at anything

322
00:12:37,968 --> 00:12:40,144
to which you put your mind.

323
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,608
And on the other hand?

324
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:45,302
- What other hand?
- Ted!

325
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:47,460
Dear Ted.

326
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:49,422
Yes, this is a quandary.

327

328
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,301
Well, things seem to be
going well.

329
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:04,890
Yeah, look, they're standing
pretty close together.

330
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:06,289
That must be a good sign.

331
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:07,857
Yeah, and he's not crossing
his arms.

332
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:09,534
- That's good body language.
- And... they're hugging!

333
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:11,057
Uh-huh.

334
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,491
And... now he's walking away.
Okay.

335
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:15,929
Well? How'd it go, Bob?

336
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:18,078
It looked like you two
were hitting off.

337
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:19,427
What're the odds of...

338
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:21,432
running into my marriage
counselor here?

339
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:23,443
I'm sorry, did you just say

340
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:25,472
you picked up your marriage
counselor?

341
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:26,645
No.

342
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,349
I'm saying she told me
she can't keep seeing me.

343
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,875
Apparently, there's a conflict
of interest

344
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,621
and, uh, she's chosen to go
with Gwen.

345
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:37,444
But... I can't blame her.

346
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:38,768
Okay,

347
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:41,145
can we try my system now?

348
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:43,408
We all laugh,
on the count of three,

349
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:45,857
as if Bob just told
a very funny joke.

350
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:47,452
Oh, no pressure.

351
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:49,468
Well, you don't actually
have to tell a joke, Bob.

352
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:51,339
Just act like you did.

353
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:55,351
And that might attract uh...
you know, someone's attention.

354
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:56,798
What if they ask me
what I said?

355
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:58,249
Well, they're not gonna ask
you what you said.

356
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,608
I don't know, Johnny.

357
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:01,817
This sounds like a really
complicated plan.

358
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:04,012
- Mm-hmm.
- It couldn't be more simple.

359
00:14:04,097 --> 00:14:06,122
Just follow my lead.

360
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,960
It's working.
It's working. Working.

361
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:20,607
Is something funny?

362
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:22,145
Well, now that you
mention it...

363
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,826
Because it looked like you
were laughing at me.

364
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:29,211
No, It's, it's just my very
available friend, Bob here,

365
00:14:29,296 --> 00:14:31,562
just said something so funny.

366
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,285
- What'd you say?
- You said they wouldn't ask.

367
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:36,722
Okay, I'm not saying
I'm bailing on this,

368
00:14:36,806 --> 00:14:39,793
but... I think I'm gonna go
mingle and...

369
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,782
I might not come back.

370
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:44,475
It's not so much, uh,
what he said,

371
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,758
it was just, uh, it was a funny
observation.

372
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:50,806
Well, next time,
observe someone else.

373
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:56,060
Crrrash and burn, Johnny.

374
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:59,486
Boy, I... I buckled
under the pressure.

375
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:02,364
But she was a dead ringer
for Gwen.

376
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:10,344
Oh, didn't know we were
bringing our friends tonight.

377
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:11,740
'Kay, I knew I shouldn't have
worn this shirt.

378
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:13,975
- No, it's nice, it's nice.
- Is it new?

379
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,681
And does it come in
an adult size?

380
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,738
It's not new.
I just haven't worn it yet.

381
00:15:17,823 --> 00:15:20,004
- So it is new then.
- Is that cologne I smell?

382
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:23,006
No. This is a leather-scented
body moisturizer.

383
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,929
So, you... you moisturized
your body then.

384
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:29,084
You know what?
Why don't we not do this?

385
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:30,478
This is getting a bit
complicated.

386
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,393
The only thing that's
complicated here

387
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:33,668
is the length of your sleeves.

388
00:15:33,752 --> 00:15:35,279
Go long, go short.
Just pick one.

389
00:15:35,364 --> 00:15:38,027
Um, as for this?
If one of us wants to leave

390
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:39,389
and the other one wants
to stay, then...

391
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,696
- We both leave.
- We... both leave, yeah.

392
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:45,778
So... I think you should knock
on the door

393
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:48,444
because these arms are nice
and warmed up.

394
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:50,540
All right.

395
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:56,102
Hi, boys.

396
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:58,145
So glad you could make it.
Come on in.

397
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,272
Oh wow.

398
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:06,710
A lot of people are here
for drinks, David.

399
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:08,101
Yeah, a few more are on
their way.

400
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:09,798
Make yourselves at home, boys.

401
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,603
- Great shirt, by the way.
- Aw.

402
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:12,637
Mm-hmm. Thanks.

403
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,091
Um...

404
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:18,217
We left our wine in the car.
Oh.

405
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:19,454
So we should go get that.

406
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:21,544
Oh, don't worry about it.
Plenty of vino here.

407
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:24,689
Yeah, it's just that ours
is um...

408
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:26,770
- kosher.
- Mm.

409
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:29,507
Well, hurry back. We're gonna
start the massage circle soon.

410
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:31,771
- Oh...
- Don't wanna miss it.

411
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:33,621
Think you're up
for the massage circle?

412
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:35,624
- This is way too many people.
- Yeah.

413
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,756
You have your coat.
We should go.

414
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,540
And... Stevie?

415
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,417
Oh... my God.

416
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,932
Huh.

417
00:16:44,107 --> 00:16:45,590
What're you doing here?

418
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:49,115
- What're you two doing here?
- We were...

419
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,683
- We were just...
- Invited for drinks?

420
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:53,424
I don't know what
you're talking about.

421
00:16:53,508 --> 00:16:54,594
We came here to say hi

422
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,803
- and now we're leaving.
- Mmhmm.

423
00:16:55,887 --> 00:16:58,066
Can I not have one thing
for myself?

424
00:16:58,229 --> 00:17:00,712
No. Anyway,
we're gonna go.

425
00:17:00,807 --> 00:17:02,118
You gonna come with?

426
00:17:02,203 --> 00:17:05,237
Uh... I still have like...
half a drink left,

427
00:17:05,322 --> 00:17:06,915
so I think I'm gonna finish it
here, and then...

428
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:08,149
meet you guys later?

429
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:10,021
- No, you won't.
- No, I won't.

430
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:12,137
- Okay.
- Have fun.

431
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:13,745
Bye.

432
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:25,064
Hey, sorry I'm late.

433
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:26,457
Myrtle was laying her eggs

434
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,829
and the whole team
was really excited.

435
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,417
Mmm! Yeah, I bet.
Fresh omelettes.

436
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:32,786
Well, Myrtle's a green sea
turtle,

437
00:17:32,871 --> 00:17:34,742
and they only spawn
every two years,

438
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:37,158
so eating her eggs would
actually disrupt

439
00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:38,426
an entire ecosystem.

440
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:40,472
Plus, there's like a ton
of cholesterol.

441
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:43,338
Mm. Um, well, it sounds
like you're super busy,

442
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,880
so I don't wanna take up
too much of your time,

443
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,565
um, but I actually wanted
to talk to you about something.

444
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,263
I know what you're going
to say, Alexis.

445
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:52,952
- You do?
- I've been dropping the ball

446
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,746
when it comes to our phone
dates.

447
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,655
Between juggling work
and, and the time difference...

448
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,664
No, Ted, you haven't done
anything wrong.

449
00:17:59,854 --> 00:18:01,492
We've both been so busy
with work,

450
00:18:01,576 --> 00:18:03,407
and then on top of all of that,
you've been...

451
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:05,688
renovating your entire
apartment for me.

452
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:07,672
Well, I put some screens
on the windows.

453
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:09,440
I wouldn't really call it
a renovation.

454
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:11,132
Okay, well, you bought
a juicer.

455
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:14,790
Um, but the more
I've been thinking about it,

456
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:17,723
the more I feel... like...

457
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:20,423
- I think you should stay where you are.
- Maybe I should stay here.

458
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:22,522
Sorry, did, did you say
something?

459
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:25,004
No. Um... What did you say?

460
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:27,955
I can't have you come here,
Alexis. You'll hate it.

461
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:30,943
And I'm not just saying that
because the screens that I installed

462
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,899
are actually attracting
more bugs somehow.

463
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:37,468
But you'd be leaving everything
that you're doing to come here,

464
00:18:37,553 --> 00:18:40,495
and... I can't guarantee that
there won't have another trip

465
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,965
that takes me away
for days at a time.

466
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:46,439
D-don't get me wrong,
I want you here so bad,

467
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:47,946
but I know you.

468
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:50,311
And no matter how many juices
I buy,

469
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,417
this place just won't feel
like home.

470
00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:58,560
Sorry. I can't tell
if the screen's frozen,

471
00:18:58,645 --> 00:18:59,560
or if you're just really
shocked.

472
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:01,859
But if you still want to come,
I'm not gonna tell you not to.

473
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:04,021
No, no, no, no. Um...

474
00:19:04,106 --> 00:19:06,386
you've made some very valid
points.

475
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:07,783
Yeah. I didn't even tell you

476
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:09,349
about the shared bathroom
situation.

477
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:12,115
Okay, well... maybe you
could've led with that.

478
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,742
Would've saved us some time.

479
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:16,656
Um, but I guess we just
wait it out?

480
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:19,129
Seems like our only option.

481
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:21,575
Yeah, until somebody invents
teleportation.

482
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:26,695
Okay, well, um...
nobody's home,

483
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,316
so why don't we start
by teleporting you

484
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,744
out of that shirt?

485
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:32,851
That's not really how
teleportation works,

486
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:34,356
but I think that I can...

487
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,576
Aww... not again!

488
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,437
I'm so sorry, uh,
but the ants are back

489
00:19:39,522 --> 00:19:41,273
and, uh, I think
what we're about to do

490
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:44,124
probably wouldn't end very well
if a fire ant was involved.

491
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,500
Um, rain check?

492
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,984
Rain check.

493
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,241
I love you!

494
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,165
Uh, mm, oh!

495
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:55,331
Love you.

496
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:05,076
Hey, I'm heading out.

497
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:06,406
Calling it a night?

498
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,523
Well, actually, my night
is just beginning.

499
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:12,528
Whoa... Welcome to
the players' club.

500
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:14,377
No, I'm not high-fiving that.

501
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:16,667
Look, her name is Vanessa,

502
00:20:16,752 --> 00:20:18,731
and she has a very single,

503
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:21,252
very attractive friend
over there,

504
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:22,596
who was just telling me about

505
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,293
all the trouble she's having
with her car.

506
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:27,742
Bob, this is right up
your alley.

507
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:30,133
Nobody knows their way around
cars like you.

508
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:32,987
Yeah, I, uh, was really
hoping to not talk shop.

509
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:35,283
Bob, just go over
and talk to her.

510
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,528
Look, be yourself.

511
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:40,356
Have a mint.
Go, go, go, go.

512
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:44,356
And that, gentlemen,

513
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:46,920
is how it's done. Bye!

514
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:51,997
You know, Roland,
I do not miss being single.

515
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,062
Whoa, here's to that.

516
00:20:54,146 --> 00:20:55,828
Cheers, my friend.

517
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:58,839
Not that I didn't have fun
in my day.

518
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,056
They actually used to call me
"the closer."

519
00:21:01,141 --> 00:21:02,946
Yeah.
Well, that was probably

520
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:04,899
because women used to close out
their tabs and go home

521
00:21:04,983 --> 00:21:06,665
when you came into the bar.

522
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,713
All right, speaking of
closing out tabs,

523
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:10,041
I think we should get out
of here.

524
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,305
Which is what the women used
to say to each other

525
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,776
when they saw you walking
through the door.

526
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,909
I'm not setting you up
anymore, Roland.

527
00:21:15,993 --> 00:21:17,650
Which is that what
your matchmaker said!

528
00:21:18,203 --> 00:21:19,748
Oh boy...

528
00:21:20,305 --> 00:21:26,679

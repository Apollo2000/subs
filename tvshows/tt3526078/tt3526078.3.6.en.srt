1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,291
Jocelyn: Okay, Jazzigals,

2
00:00:02,316 --> 00:00:04,651
let's gather in for a warm up!

3
00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:07,140
Okay!

4
00:00:07,165 --> 00:00:08,832
Oh, before we start,

5
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:11,015
I just wanna warn everybody,

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,054
there is a murderer on the loose.

7
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,796
- In this
town. - Uh-oh.

8
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:20,430
So heads up, eyes peeled, guys.

9
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:22,589
Moira: Twyla, are you all right?

10
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,773
I will be...

11
00:00:23,977 --> 00:00:26,245
if I can get a few friends
together this weekend

12
00:00:26,287 --> 00:00:28,140
to catch this murderer.

13
00:00:28,523 --> 00:00:31,024
Until then, it shall remain a mystery!

14
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:34,395
Oh, I think I know where this is going!

15
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:36,563
It's my murder mystery
party this weekend.

16
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:38,098
Oh, I see!

17
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:39,833
Sorry if I scared anyone.

18
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:41,015
Jocelyn: I was scared you weren't gonna

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,053
to have it this year!

20
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,218
John and I used to attend
"Eyes Wide Shut" parties

21
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:46,093
at the Castros'.

22
00:00:46,953 --> 00:00:49,610
Though... I'm guessing
your evening's activities

23
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:51,345
might be somewhat different.

24
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:53,113
I don't know,

25
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:55,178
it can get pretty wild.

26
00:00:55,203 --> 00:00:57,751
Oh yeah, you never know
how the evening's gonna end!

27
00:00:57,786 --> 00:00:59,460
Or when!

28
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:02,122
Well, John and I would love to help you

29
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:03,557
ensnare this maniac,

30
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:06,260
but we have plans this Saturday night.

31
00:01:06,294 --> 00:01:08,382
Oh well, the party's actually Friday.

32
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,397
I had a 50/50 chance there.

33
00:01:10,432 --> 00:01:11,687
So you can come?

34
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:15,625
Oh, I would be pleased to RSVP as...

35
00:01:16,037 --> 00:01:17,304
pending.

36
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:19,206
Just uh, as soon as I double check,

37
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,867
and circle back.

38
00:01:20,892 --> 00:01:22,226
Mhmm.

39
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:27,080
Oh, this is gonna be so great!

40
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:31,752

41
00:01:33,822 --> 00:01:35,989
1:00 P.M., terrific.

42
00:01:36,024 --> 00:01:37,781
Yeah, looking forward.

43
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,139
Bye.

44
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:42,633
Did somebody book a room?

45
00:01:42,658 --> 00:01:45,015
Even better, someone might book a room.

46
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:47,289
How is that better?

47
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:49,726
A lot of people might book
a room if this goes through.

48
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,414
Okay, but you're still
using the word "might."

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,073
That was the Elm Glen Golf Club.

50
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:55,042
They wanna put together
a package with us.

51
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:56,443
A weekend of golf,

52
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,023
and a stay at a luxurious motel.

53
00:01:59,796 --> 00:02:01,215
What motel is that?

54
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:02,827
I'm gonna let them
work out the verbiage,

55
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:04,218
but the upshot is this,

56
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:05,886
on a $250 dollar package,

57
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:08,382
a cool $40 goes into our pockets.

58
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,324
That sounds like a better deal for them.

59
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:12,671
Well, it's all about
building bridges, Stevie.

60
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:14,063
But here's the thing,

61
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:15,789
even if this deal falls through,

62
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:19,084
we still get an afternoon
on a golf course!

63
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:20,203
"We?"

64
00:02:20,228 --> 00:02:22,529
This is a big day for us, Stevie!

65
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:24,071
You know it's been three years

66
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:25,606
since I've played a round of golf?

67
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,176
Yeah, um... golf's not really my thing.

68
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:31,111
Except there was this
one point in high school

69
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:33,614
where I got this haircut
that everyone said

70
00:02:33,648 --> 00:02:35,782
made me look like I was in the LPGA.

71
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:37,317
Well listen, I'm sure you could use

72
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:38,952
an afternoon outdoors, okay?

73
00:02:38,987 --> 00:02:41,488
Think of it as a
team-building exercise.

74
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:42,968
Okay.

75
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,264
I might even let you drive the cart.

76
00:02:45,393 --> 00:02:47,594
- Can you drink on the cart?
- Yeah.

77
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:50,232
Well, I will get the
"back in 15 minutes" sign.

78
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:52,900
Well, it's gonna take
longer than 15 minutes.

79
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:56,866
You have to give people hope.

80
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:05,752
(Music plays, patrons chatter)

81
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:08,415
So, Mrs. Rose,

82
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:09,998
I don't mean to pressure you,

83
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,585
but I am anxious to know...

84
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:14,688
Understandably, yes,
BLT please, no bread.

85
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:16,189
Oh, I meant if you were coming

86
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:17,591
to the murder mystery party.

87
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,171
Oh that, yes.

88
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,795
Yes, you are?

89
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,931
It's just that it's the
end of the week Twyla,

90
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:25,899
so that's always chockablock.

91
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:27,267
And then there are the kids...

92
00:03:27,302 --> 00:03:28,539
Well, both of them,

93
00:03:28,564 --> 00:03:30,203
David, Alexis.

94
00:03:30,238 --> 00:03:32,882
Well, I know you're busy,
I was just-I don't know,

95
00:03:32,907 --> 00:03:35,310
I was just hoping you'd
bring a little something

96
00:03:35,335 --> 00:03:36,586
to the party.

97
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:38,211
A touch of celebrity, perhaps.

98
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:40,180
- I was actually thinking bagel bites.
- Ah!

99
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:41,548
Did I mention it was a potluck?

100
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,820
Oh, you most certainly did not.

101
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:49,357
Well, I would ask someone else,

102
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:53,140
it's just that uh, so
far no one is coming.

103
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:55,492
No one's coming to your party?

104
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:59,032
Well, in fairness, the party
is still a few hours away.

105
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:00,901
And some people did say
that if another thing

106
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:02,636
that's supposed to
happen doesn't happen,

107
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,271
then they might be able to come,

108
00:04:04,305 --> 00:04:05,872
so, that's good.

109
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:07,975
So as of now you have no
one on your guest list?

110
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:09,776
Well, I shouldn't have said no one,

111
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:11,000
My mom will come.

112
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:14,314
And she'll probably bring
whoever she's dating.

113
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:16,817
And he'll most likely
bring some younger friend.

114
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:19,414
Twyla, this is unacceptable!

115
00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:23,164
There are myriad tactics to
boost numbers at your party!

116
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:26,179
Well, you start by comping
a few influential guests.

117
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:28,405
You'd be shocked at how many
celebrities show up to a thing

118
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:30,964
with the promise of a free Wagyu slider.

119
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:33,934
I-I'm not charging anyone,
this is just for fun.

120
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:36,312
Oh, this is worse than I assumed!

121
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:38,765
How about a signature cocktail?

122
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,812
I hadn't thought of that.

123
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,011
- Okay, shouldn't you be...
- Oh, yeah.

124
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:45,656
Okay, we're going to
start with follow-up.

125
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,481
You secure your VIP list,

126
00:04:47,546 --> 00:04:49,914
and you work your way down from there.

127
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:53,351
(Birds chirp)

128
00:04:56,057 --> 00:04:57,476
(Door slams)

129
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:59,296
- Hi.
- Hi.

130
00:04:59,804 --> 00:05:01,062
Where's Stevie?

131
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:03,851
Um, I don't know, but she
will be back in 15 minutes.

132
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,740
What are you doing?

133
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:07,666
I'm just checking the mail.

134
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:10,386
Did you know you can still get mail?

135
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:11,938
Yes, I know about mail.

136
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:14,241
No, but I'm talking
about like, mail, mail.

137
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:16,006
Like a little man in a uniform,

138
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:17,611
with his satchel full of letters,

139
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:19,346
traveling door to door.

140
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,682
Um, that's a mailman.

141
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:24,751
And he comes to your house, you pay him,

142
00:05:24,786 --> 00:05:26,664
and he gives you your stuff.

143
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:29,883
I think it's free delivery, David.

144
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:32,257
- I don't think so...
- Mmm!

145
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:36,625
How far into the 15
minutes do you think we are?

146
00:05:37,265 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay, don't take this the wrong way,

147
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:43,270
but you've just been kind of
hanging around a lot lately,

148
00:05:43,304 --> 00:05:45,639
- which isn't a bad thing,
- Mhmm...

149
00:05:45,673 --> 00:05:48,442
but it's also not a good thing.

150
00:05:48,476 --> 00:05:50,377
Yeah, um...

151
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:53,013
it's just that the town only
has so many ex-boyfriends

152
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:55,507
to hand out secretary work.

153
00:05:55,783 --> 00:05:57,350
Um, first of all, David,

154
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:59,553
- I'm an assistant, not a secretary,
- Oh.

155
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:02,355
And second of all, Ted
is not my ex-boyfriend,

156
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,891
he is ex-fiance.

157
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:06,326
And I'll have you know,

158
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,895
that I might not be an
assistant for much longer.

159
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,566
What is this?

160
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,601
- It's Elmdale College.
- Ooh.

161
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:16,380
Ted and I have been
talking about me doing like,

162
00:06:16,404 --> 00:06:18,038
an accounting course,

163
00:06:18,072 --> 00:06:19,639
or an office management course,

164
00:06:19,674 --> 00:06:23,187
but I think I can maybe
broaden my horizons a bit.

165
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:26,140
You've circled "Stars and Cosmology?"

166
00:06:26,347 --> 00:06:28,749
Oh yeah, I thought
it said "Cosmetology."

167
00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:30,917
Ugh!

168
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:32,976
Can I just... for a sec?

169
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,757
Here is Jocelyn's visor,

170
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,320
and her glove.

171
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:39,937
Oh, uh, I don't think
I'm gonna be playing,

172
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:41,928
but thanks.

173
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:44,831
Okay, you know what, just
in case you change your mind,

174
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:46,767
why don't I show you a few pointers?

175
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:48,135
I can do it right here on Johnny.

176
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:49,569
Oh, I don't think so.

177
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:50,968
I mean, a few pointers couldn't hurt.

178
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,117
- Oh, I-I don't think that necessary.
- Here, come on, Jonathan.

179
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:55,343
- Okay, whoa.
- Come on down.

180
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:57,488
Right there, let me see your stance,

181
00:06:57,512 --> 00:06:58,828
what do you got goin' here?

182
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:01,748
Well, the set up is
very important, Stevie.

183
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:03,517
Uh, legs so far apart,

184
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:05,485
- knees slightly bent.
- Ooh!

185
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,255
Make sure you're nice and
balanced over the ball.

186
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:09,671
Yeah, woo!

187
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,993
Johnny, I gotta tell you,
you have a sensational stance.

188
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,995
Well, I've been golfing
for 30 years, Roland.

189
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:16,734
Wow, I like that.

190
00:07:17,098 --> 00:07:18,609
There's one thing I don't like about it,

191
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:19,966
and let me show it to you.

192
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:21,070
I don't think I was asking.

193
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:22,880
Well, I think it's better
that we show Stevie,

194
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:24,851
than just talk about it, don't you?

195
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:27,678
Right, okay, so just first off,

196
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:29,419
spread your legs just a little
wider, if you would, for me.

197
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:31,617
- All right.
- There, see, Stevie?

198
00:07:31,642 --> 00:07:33,290
They've gotta be like, sort
of even with the shoulders,

199
00:07:33,314 --> 00:07:35,779
and if you would just
pop the old tush...

200
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:37,217
Just go, Bam!

201
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:39,452
That's it, and now
loosen up a little bit.

202
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:40,887
- Okay.
- Yeah!

203
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:42,266
All right, you know what,
Roland, I think...

204
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,657
I should be showing you,

205
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:45,292
because I don't really think you know

206
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:46,860
what you're... doing.

207
00:07:46,894 --> 00:07:49,296
- Yes, right.
- Okay now, grip, very important.

208
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,531
- Yeah?
- Are you using the Vargon grip?

209
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:53,351
I'm using La Va Grande.

210
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:55,043
Are you watching this, Stevie?

211
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:56,647
Yeah, this is just a
little hard to understand,

212
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,271
so I want a record of it.

213
00:07:58,306 --> 00:07:59,950
- Okay, delete that, please!
- Can I get a copy of that?

214
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:01,341
Yeah.

215
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:09,015
- Oh hi, Moira.
- Hi.

216
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,951
I thought that Roland
might still be here.

217
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:13,835
No, it seems our mayor
is keeping summer hours.

218
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,226
Gotcha.

219
00:08:16,357 --> 00:08:18,325
Jocelyn...

220
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:21,703
it's really good to
see you out and about.

221
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:23,864
Yes, I was starting to worry.

222
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:25,932
- Why?
- Well, I happened to be chatting

223
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:28,535
with our dear little Twyla
about her party tonight,

224
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,289
and she mentioned that
you have yet to RSVP?

225
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:35,224
And I thought, that's
not the Jocelyn I know.

226
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:37,379
What must've felled her?

227
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:41,060
I'm fine, here's the thing.

228
00:08:41,282 --> 00:08:43,483
These parties are not great.

229
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:46,119
Last year it went until 3 am,

230
00:08:46,153 --> 00:08:49,222
And Twyla just wandered around
kind of winking at everybody,

231
00:08:49,257 --> 00:08:51,625
until she realized she
hadn't picked a murderer.

232
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:54,361
And then the year before
there were three murderers,

233
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:56,867
and one of them
actually robbed the cafe!

234
00:08:57,344 --> 00:09:00,382
Well, I hear this year is
going to be very different.

235
00:09:00,935 --> 00:09:03,103
Twyla apparently sought counsel.

236
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:04,838
Expect thoughtful party favors,

237
00:09:04,872 --> 00:09:06,632
themed cocktails,

238
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:08,475
first class catering.

239
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:09,943
I thought it was a potluck?

240
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:12,345
You, Jocelyn, are the mayor's wife,

241
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,848
you are the self-appointed
leader of the Jazzigals,

242
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:16,383
and most importantly,

243
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:18,460
Twyla worships you.

244
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,854
- She does?
- Yes.

245
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:23,593
This party has real momentum now.

246
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,325
And with you attached,

247
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:28,161
it's no less than a
snowball gathering speed,

248
00:09:28,195 --> 00:09:31,953
picking up bodies as it rolls downhill.

249
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:34,246
- And that's good?
- Very good.

250
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,656
(Laughs)

251
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:38,714
Well, I guess I could talk
to the other Jazzigals.

252
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:41,207
I just wish I hadn't thrown
out that flapper dress

253
00:09:41,242 --> 00:09:43,076
from Halloween last year.

254
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,111
- Oh!
- Spread the word!

255
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:47,265
Be the snowball.

256
00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:50,092
Be the snowball!

257
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,787
Okay, it's just that I misplaced

258
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:56,406
my high school diploma
when we lost our house.

259
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:59,649
No, I wish it was a flood.

260
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:02,472
Okay well, chasing down the paperwork

261
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:04,030
seems like a lot of work.

262
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,726
No, I know that...

263
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:08,428
I know that your courses
require a lot of work,

264
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:11,328
I'm just... what if it was a flood?

265
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:15,208
Okay fine, I will call you
back with the paperwork, thanks.

266
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:16,710
(Phone beeps off)

267
00:10:16,744 --> 00:10:18,478
Um, what's going on?

268
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:20,513
Are you looking at courses now?

269
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:22,515
Um, I'm just putting some feelers out.

270
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,317
A lot of people have encouraged me

271
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:26,853
to build on the skills I
acquired creative director

272
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:28,822
of the Blouse Barn, so.

273
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:30,190
Like who?

274
00:10:30,224 --> 00:10:31,945
I thought it could be good for me.

275
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,128
Okay, well, this is
sort of my thing, though.

276
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:37,097
I really don't think
you can claim education

277
00:10:37,131 --> 00:10:38,665
as your thing,

278
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:41,034
and I don't even think I'll
be able to take those courses,

279
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:42,736
because the stupid people at the college

280
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,804
wouldn't just take my word
for it when I told them

281
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,828
that I had a high school diploma.

282
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,775
But why do you need it, though?

283
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:50,710
To prove that I graduated high school.

284
00:10:50,745 --> 00:10:52,255
Well, it's not like
they're gonna be like,

285
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,342
"oh, you don't have
your high school diploma,

286
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,249
you can't come to our college."

287
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:58,251
That's almost word for word

288
00:10:58,285 --> 00:11:00,101
what they just said to me on the phone.

289
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:04,290
Well...

290
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:05,984
I just don't think I
have that kind of time.

291
00:11:08,164 --> 00:11:10,498
- Okay, what are you doing?
- Reorganizing my knits!

292
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:16,036
(Car rumbles)

293
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:23,358
(Birds chirp)

294
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:25,779
- Oh, there they are.
- Oh.

295
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:27,347
Mr. Rose, Ms. Budd.

296
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:29,582
Yes, please call me Johnny.

297
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:32,226
Always nice to put a face to the name.

298
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:35,221
Oh, I see you two came
dressed for the occasion.

299
00:11:35,256 --> 00:11:36,823
Always ready.

300
00:11:36,857 --> 00:11:39,392
- I like your visor.
- Thanks, it's new.

301
00:11:39,427 --> 00:11:42,162
So I hear there's quite a few
new developments at your motel.

302
00:11:42,196 --> 00:11:43,563
Uh, we'd love to hear about them,

303
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:45,492
why don't we have a seat?

304
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:49,469
Oh, you wanna have the meeting inside?

305
00:11:49,503 --> 00:11:51,335
On a day like this?

306
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:53,542
Sorry, did you think
we'd be playing a round?

307
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:56,118
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

308
00:11:56,143 --> 00:11:59,012
We-we had a meeting
earlier at another club,

309
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:01,714
and they wanted us to
test drive the course,

310
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:04,184
so... we're in the attire.

311
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:06,619
Oh, where were you playing?

312
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:11,414
Uh, we were playing at um...

313
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:13,660
it was what course, Stevie?

314
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:15,095
It was down the road.

315
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:16,763
Uh, Maple...

316
00:12:16,797 --> 00:12:19,532
- Grove?
- Grove, Maple Grove.

317
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:20,900
Maple Grove?

318
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:23,703
No, I don't know that one.

319
00:12:23,737 --> 00:12:26,072
Oh, really? It's a beautiful course.

320
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:29,210
Very exclusive, Uh, but it is set...

321
00:12:29,543 --> 00:12:31,277
way back off the road, it's...

322
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:32,923
Which might explain
why you've never seen

323
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:35,148
- or heard of it.
- Yeah.

324
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:43,967
Johnny: So every room will have wi-fi,

325
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:45,393
and upgraded beds,

326
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:48,647
Uh, working toilets,
which probably sounds like

327
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:50,739
something I don't need
to mention but you know,

328
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:51,875
just covering all the bases.

329
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,234
Well, that sounds great.

330
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:55,491
Well, it's just that um...

331
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:58,813
We've been talking to
the Elmington Moto-Lodge,

332
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:01,437
and they've got coin
laundry, and a Jacuzzi.

333
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:05,853
Well, we can certainly put in a Jacuzzi.

334
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:09,382
Yeah, Jacuzzis are very
popular with our golfers.

335
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:11,993
Well, as an avid golfer myself,

336
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:14,295
I can tell you that when
you buy a golf package,

337
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,431
you don't necessarily want
to spend the entire weekend

338
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,066
sitting in your room.

339
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:20,093
(Managers laugh)

340
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:21,632
Well, thanks for coming by.

341
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:24,710
And definitely let us know
when you've got that Jacuzzi.

342
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:27,676
Yes, we uh, we will.

343
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:33,804
I guess that's all,
that's it now, thanks.

344
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:37,127
Yeah, well, listen, it's uh still early,

345
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:39,984
do you guys have any
other plans this afternoon?

346
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,604
We have another meeting.

347
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:45,626
Oh well, you know what they say,

348
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:46,898
too much work...

349
00:13:46,923 --> 00:13:48,290
(All laugh)

350
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:49,875
- Well, thanks for coming in.
- Okay.

351
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:53,609
You go on ahead, I'm just
gonna go use the restroom.

352
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:57,585
Oh sure, might as well
use some of the amenities.

353
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:01,629
(Car whooshes by)

354
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,674
(Dogs bark)

355
00:14:06,238 --> 00:14:07,571
Hey.

356
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:10,995
Um, you know those courses
we were talking about?

357
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,787
Oh yeah, I thought
that data management one

358
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:14,232
looked like it might be good for you.

359
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:15,957
Mhmm, yeah, I had the same thought,

360
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:18,426
but when I looked into it,
all the courses were full.

361
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,837
And then the courses that weren't full

362
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:21,229
conflicted with each other,

363
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:22,648
and then everything just canceled out.

364
00:14:23,203 --> 00:14:24,676
Alexis, if you don't
wanna take the course,

365
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,179
you don't have to take the course.

366
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:29,728
No, there were courses that
did look very interesting.

367
00:14:29,932 --> 00:14:31,967
Um, it's just kind of complicated.

368
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:34,234
Yeah, but it's so worth it.

369
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:36,740
Sometimes I wish I
could go back to college.

370
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:39,070
Pub nights, frisbee in the quad...

371
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,734
- Hmm!
- Late night hacky sack.

372
00:14:41,031 --> 00:14:41,590
Mhmm.

373
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,265
We got some serious
sack circles going.

374
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,024
Oh, so many sex circles.

375
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:47,417
Sack. Hacky sack.

376
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:49,257
We always hoped they'd lead to sex,

377
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,626
but... still.

378
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,561
College, so crazy.

379
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:55,476
So crazy.

380
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:57,638
Um...

381
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:03,046
Okay, the thing is...

382
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:05,006
I can't go to college,

383
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:06,203
yet.

384
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:09,378
Because I didn't finish high school.

385
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:11,212
- Oh.
- I know.

386
00:15:11,246 --> 00:15:12,790
It's so embarrassing, and
I never should've taken

387
00:15:12,814 --> 00:15:14,195
that semester off.

388
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:16,317
But I did meet Beyonce in Mykonos,

389
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:18,119
so it was almost worth it.

390
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:19,487
Didn't you say on your resume

391
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:21,453
that you did four years at UCLA?

392
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,658
Yes... technically,

393
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:26,327
if you consider Bel Air
an extension of the campus,

394
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:27,898
which everybody does.

395
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:34,765
This might sound crazy,

396
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:38,440
but I almost think I
should finish high school.

397
00:15:38,465 --> 00:15:41,000
That... doesn't sound crazy at all.

398
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:42,870
And truth be told,

399
00:15:42,895 --> 00:15:45,281
it took me a minute to
finish high school myself.

400
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:48,126
You're only saying that
to make me feel better.

401
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,161
No, no, me and some friends,
we just got in a car,

402
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:52,179
and took off.
- Really?

403
00:15:52,204 --> 00:15:54,305
Yeah, we were following
the American Idol tour.

404
00:15:54,556 --> 00:15:55,923
We missed a couple shows,

405
00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:57,758
but it's always the exact same set,

406
00:15:57,793 --> 00:15:59,984
so... no regrets.

407
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:03,921
Um, I really wish you hadn't
told me that last little bit,

408
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:05,347
but... thank you.

409
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:07,748
That makes two of us.

410
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:11,306
- Good round?
- Not bad.

411
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:13,623
Greens are a little
fast, but I like that.

412
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:15,049
Me too.

413
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,538
I've given a heads-up to the starter.

414
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,273
The tee is yours.

415
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:25,385
- Have a great round, you two.
- Thanks so much.

416
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:27,609
How did you make that happen?

417
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:29,189
I asked.

418
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,648
Well, that's very nice, Stevie!

419
00:16:32,454 --> 00:16:33,955
Thank you.

420
00:16:34,146 --> 00:16:37,171
Okay, let's get our golf sticks.

421
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:47,976
David,

422
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:50,236
and why am I not surprised
to see you in here?

423
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:52,129
Well, this is my room.

424
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:54,849
Well, it's disheartening
to see you like this.

425
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,817
Did you know that according to IMDB,

426
00:16:56,852 --> 00:16:59,520
Rosa Parks was in an episode
of "Touched By an Angel?"

427
00:16:59,554 --> 00:17:00,988
Exactly, David.

428
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:02,623
You are bored, lethargic,

429
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:05,159
and practically dripping with ennui!

430
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:07,027
Okay, that's a bit much.

431
00:17:07,062 --> 00:17:08,710
I blame myself.

432
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:11,298
I've set a standard of
activity and engagement

433
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,156
so high you don't even try.

434
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:17,204
Okay, I am on a much needed respite

435
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:19,073
whilst in between jobs.

436
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:21,108
You are squandering your social capital.

437
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:23,043
A taste-maker like you
should be out there,

438
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:24,412
tasting things!

439
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:26,046
Uh, I'm at the buffet,

440
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:28,582
and there is nothing to taste!

441
00:17:28,617 --> 00:17:31,398
Well, there's a party
tonight, as a matter of fact.

442
00:17:31,553 --> 00:17:33,721
- The murder mystery thing?
- Why not?

443
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:35,856
Does this town not deserve
to have a marquee guest

444
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:38,659
like yourself grace their humble soiree?

445
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:40,327
Speaking of marquee guests,

446
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:41,729
I'm surprised you're going.

447
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:43,174
I can understand why you'd say that,

448
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:46,000
but... don't you just know
Twyla would be thrilled

449
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:48,836
to have as many Roses
there tonight as possible!

450
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,265
(Sighs)

451
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:53,541
Fine, I will make a surprise appearance.

452
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:55,475
- Good.
- But it's twice around the room,

453
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,745
- and then I'm out.
- Is there any other way?

454
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,713
Oh, and it's Roaring Twenties themed,

455
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:02,183
and I know you have a
soft spot for seersucker.

456
00:18:02,217 --> 00:18:05,719
- I won't be dressing up.
- Aw, say, don't be a dew-dropper!

457
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:07,421
Throw some concealer
under those peepers,

458
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:10,391
make like a swell,
and go put on the Ritz!

459
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:19,900
(Birds chirp)

460
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:24,338
(Grass rustles)

461
00:18:33,226 --> 00:18:34,627
(Thwack)

462
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:39,960
- Woo.
- Good golf shot!

463
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,885
Thank you, Stevie.

464
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:48,328
Ah...

465
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:53,534
(Golf cart starts up and rumbles off)

466
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,687
(Crickets chirp)

467
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:02,710
(Clinks)
- Oh!

468
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:04,778
John, are you going to be done soon?

469
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:07,398
Just working on my short game, Moira.

470
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:10,284
Stevie and I are pitching
Oak Valley next week,

471
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:12,164
I just wanna make sure I'm ready.

472
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:14,688
Well, the endless
tinking of putter to ball

473
00:19:14,723 --> 00:19:16,090
tells me you will be.

474
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:18,078
Well, it's for the motel.

475
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,414
It's not like... I'm enjoying this.

476
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:24,164
(Phone rings)
- Ohhhh!

477
00:19:24,189 --> 00:19:25,851
Beautiful, see that?

478
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:28,296
(Phone rings)
- Ahem!

479
00:19:28,748 --> 00:19:30,082
Rose residence.

480
00:19:30,107 --> 00:19:31,841
Uh, where are you?!

481
00:19:32,307 --> 00:19:33,641
May I ask who's calling?

482
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:36,310
You know who this is,
and you know where I am.

483
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:38,031
Did everyone show up?

484
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:39,906
Yes, everybody showed up.

485
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:41,582
Good, then my work is done.

486
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:43,017
Uh no, your job is not done,

487
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:45,486
You guilted me into coming here tonight!

488
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,898
And you're better off for it, David.

489
00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:48,304
You should thank me.

490
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:51,968
Twyla was set to throw a fiasco
until I exerted my influence.

491
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:53,538
Uh yeah, and the way Twyla keeps asking

492
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:54,929
about where you are,

493
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:56,656
I'm pretty sure you're the murderer.

494
00:19:57,058 --> 00:19:58,825
They'll never catch me.

495
00:20:00,728 --> 00:20:02,596
Ugh!

496
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:03,988
Who was that?

497
00:20:04,013 --> 00:20:05,346
I don't know.

498
00:20:07,843 --> 00:20:10,405
***

499
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,046
because we trusted you!

500
00:20:12,071 --> 00:20:15,106
That school cost $250,000 dollars!

501
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,367
I know, and I felt so bad about it.

502
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:20,523
And that is why I
missed my final semester.

503
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:23,609
Wait a minute, we
were at the graduation!

504
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:25,625
- Yeah!
- I know, but I wasn't.

505
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:28,056
We saw you there!

506
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:29,664
- Did we, though?
- Yeah.

507
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:30,703
We were there,

508
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:32,687
we might not have
stayed through the "R's,"

509
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:34,513
I think we left halfway
through the "L's."

510
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:36,843
Oh, yeah, it got very repetitive.

511
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,691
No, I distinctly remember
a celebratory lunch

512
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:41,554
at the Hotel de Ville, in Crissier,

513
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,172
and you'd had that unfortunate run-in

514
00:20:43,196 --> 00:20:45,078
with the spray tan machine.

515
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:46,375
- Uh-uh.
- No, that was-that was me.

516
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,914
Ah! Yeah!

517
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:50,750
Then how do you explain
this graduation photo?

518
00:20:50,775 --> 00:20:52,142
Huh?

519
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:56,296
That's Jess Chang!

520
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,310
- What? Jess Chang?
- Ugh!

521
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:01,323
Well, who can tell with all this hair

522
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:02,714
in front of your face?

523
00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:03,859
That's not my face!

524
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:06,252
Okay, why didn't anyone
come to my graduation?

525
00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:08,144
Well, you didn't
graduate in Switzerland.

526
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:09,903
And whose fault is that?!

527
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:12,404
How long have you been carrying
that around in your wallet?!

528
00:21:13,026 --> 00:21:19,932

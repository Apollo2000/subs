1
00:00:47,217 --> 00:00:51,391
We're getting out!

2
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:54,427
We're finally getting out!

3
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:56,585
Oh my God.

4
00:00:56,993 --> 00:00:58,664
I mean it!

5
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,954
Oh my-oh my God!

6
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:07,723
Oh my God!

7
00:01:07,758 --> 00:01:09,230
Johnny...

8
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:14,591
- Synced for Bobikowa -

9
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:16,537
Told you I'd sell
this town. Didn't I tell you?

10
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:17,938
Yes. Not to diminish
your accomplishment,

11
00:01:17,972 --> 00:01:20,121
but you did say that a handful of times.

12
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:21,647
I think eight, to be exact.

13
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,181
It bears repeating.

14
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:25,066
My little suity-cases! Oh!

15
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:27,274
David? Should I take this with me?

16
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:29,409
If I'm being perfectly
honest, it's very low

17
00:01:29,443 --> 00:01:31,411
on the totem pole of coats
of yours that I like, but...

18
00:01:31,445 --> 00:01:32,445
It was a gift from your father.

19
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,181
Hey, that's a good coat.

20
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:37,050
I outbid Richard Branson for
it at the Kiminski auction.

21
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:40,520
I did get sick of having
hot coffee and blood thrown at me.

22
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:43,622
You know who covets this coat? Jocelyn.

23
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:45,524
I could bestow it upon
her as a parting gift.

24
00:01:45,558 --> 00:01:47,526
We may want to put pen to paper

25
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,896
before we start giving away
designer clothing, sweetheart.

26
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,531
It would be her first piece of clothing

27
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:56,296
made outside of mainland
China. I'm gonna do it.

28
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:59,304
Honestly, I cannot
wait to get to the beach.

29
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:00,907
- What?
- Yeah, I'm going to St. Barts

30
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:03,575
with Jenna, Leisha, and...

31
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,843
Some other girl with an "ah" name

32
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:07,012
that I can't quite remember.

33
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:09,648
- Huh.
- Why? What are you doing?

34
00:02:09,682 --> 00:02:12,947
Well, I'm gonna go to New
York and um... see some people.

35
00:02:12,972 --> 00:02:14,763
Oh! What people?

36
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:17,120
You don't know them. Just people.

37
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:20,025
I thought everyone just kind
of dropped you like flies

38
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:23,260
when you couldn't pick up the
tab at the Waverly anymore?

39
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:25,244
Well, that's absolutely not true.

40
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:27,732
I just have a different kind
of relationship with my friends

41
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,166
where we don't need to be in
constant contact with each other.

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,363
Okay.

43
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:35,629
You should um... come to
New York after you're done.

44
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:39,143
And do what, eat a cronut
at a Brooklyn flea market?

45
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:42,513
Well, I was thinking
maybe we could get a...

46
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:45,148
A two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan

47
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:47,465
and not have to live in Brooklyn.

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,154
Honestly, David, and like no offense,

49
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:53,122
but when I get out of here,
I'm gonna get my own place

50
00:02:53,157 --> 00:02:55,954
so I can pack how I wanna pack

51
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:58,574
and I don't have to be called
a circus freak all the time.

52
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:04,780
Ding-dong.

53
00:03:04,814 --> 00:03:07,049
- Moira, hey!
- Hi, Jocelyn.

54
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:09,285
Gosh, you look so glamorous today.

55
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,020
Oh, thank you. Some days it just works.

56
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:12,721
Yeah.

57
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:15,218
So I guess you heard the news.

58
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:16,725
I heard there was someone
interested in buying...

59
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,427
Yes, we're leaving.

60
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:19,561
I didn't know it was finalized.

61
00:03:19,596 --> 00:03:21,264
And since we're leaving...

62
00:03:21,298 --> 00:03:24,065
dear God it feels good to be saying that!

63
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,967
I would like to give you this

64
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:28,437
as a little keepsake to remember me by.

65
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:29,971
Wow.

66
00:03:31,908 --> 00:03:33,575
Is-is it a wig?

67
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:39,267
No. It's a coat. It's the coat.

68
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:41,082
What coat?

69
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:43,618
The coat you kept going
on about that one time.

70
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:45,386
Are you sure it was me?

71
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:47,833
Oh, it's absolutely tragic, Jocelyn,

72
00:03:47,858 --> 00:03:51,427
that I will never see or
speak to you ever again.

73
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:53,461
- Well...
- But I will have my memories

74
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:57,031
and you will have this incredible coat.

75
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:59,500
Goodbye, dear friend.

76
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:01,335
Goodbye, Moira Rose.

77
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:04,938
Hey! What're you doing here?

78
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:07,407
- Um, can I... ?
- Yeah, yeah, come on in.

79
00:04:12,146 --> 00:04:13,713
- Hey.
- Hey.

80
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:18,525
Um... so big news. We've sold the town.

81
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:22,355
- Wow. O-okay, and...
- And we're leaving.

82
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:24,657
We're leaving?

83
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:26,869
Well, me and my family are leaving.

84
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,895
Oh.

85
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:32,531
Yeah...

86
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:35,005
Oh. Okay.

87
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,513
Well, in that case then, um, here,

88
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:40,539
there's something that I need to show you.

89
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:43,308
Okay.

90
00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:45,013
Uh...

91
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:48,346
Originally, we were gonna be on an
all-inclusive vacation when I did this...

92
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,414
What's an all-inclusive vacation?

93
00:04:59,118 --> 00:05:03,427
Alexis Claire Rose... Will you marry me?

94
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:05,029
Uh... uh...

95
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:13,037
Yes!

96
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,837
If I was staying, then yes!

97
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:20,378
A thousand times, yes!

98
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,347
And if things were different
and I wasn't leaving,

99
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:27,117
um, then definitely yes!

100
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:30,799
So... is that a no?

101
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:32,555
Yes... ?

102
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:43,366
Are you stealing Roland's truck?

103
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:46,135
Yeah. It's not exactly a Tesla,

104
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:49,538
but it'll get our bags to the airport.

105
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:50,772
So you wanted to see me?

106
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:54,451
Yeah. I had an idea.

107
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:57,179
Oh-oh.

108
00:05:57,213 --> 00:06:01,183
What if you came with me to New York?

109
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:03,518
- What?
- Yeah.

110
00:06:03,552 --> 00:06:04,885
Are you ser... really?

111
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,788
Mm-hmm.

112
00:06:07,822 --> 00:06:10,013
- New York?!
- Yeah.

113
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:13,761
I don't even know what I would do there.

114
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:15,163
Oh, you just watch a season of "Girls"

115
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:20,268
and do the opposite of
what they do. It's easy.

116
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:22,702
You have this like whole life there,

117
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:25,405
with all these fancy friends...

118
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,541
Who, in my head, at
least all dress like you,

119
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:29,543
and I feel like I'd get lost in the mix.

120
00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:31,318
Mm-hmm.

121
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:37,810
Well, all of my friends will
probably be away for the summer

122
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:40,587
and I have found a really beautiful
two-bedroom in the East Village.

123
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:42,221
It's beautiful, so...

124
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:44,623
Oh, two bedroom.

125
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:46,158
Yeah. I mean, I was
looking at three bedrooms,

126
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:48,494
but do I really need an
office? I don't... I don't know.

127
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:52,364
Yeah... right.

128
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,201
You're coming! You're coming to New York!

129
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:57,369
Pack a bag. Pack two bags.

130
00:06:57,404 --> 00:06:59,472
How many bags do you have?

131
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:02,168
I'm saving you from this dumpy town.

132
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:06,223
See you soon!

133
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:11,918
Oh, Twyla...

134
00:07:11,943 --> 00:07:14,552
Oh, hey, Mr. Rose. I
heard you guys were leaving.

135
00:07:14,587 --> 00:07:17,089
Yes, yes, we are,

136
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:19,457
and I just wanted to thank you for all
the great service over the past few months.

137
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:21,426
You're welcome.

138
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,795
Yeah, judging by your tips,
I was never really sure.

139
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,376
Oh. I'll have a coffee
when you get a minute.

140
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:33,971
Johnny, I gotta talk to you.

141
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:38,676
Listen, uh... I don't wanna
piss in your punch bowl, okay,

142
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,846
but um... I got a bad feeling about
this buyer guy of yours, Andy...

143
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,581
- Roberts. Right, right.
- Roberts.

144
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:47,674
Very successful. His family made
a fortune in the shelving business.

145
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,315
Okay, fine. Um...

146
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,829
He called me while he was
bumping uglies with this old lady.

147
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:54,824
Oh no, really?

148
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:57,194
But that's not the problem. The problem
is he put me on the speaker phone.

149
00:07:57,228 --> 00:07:58,776
I mean, who would do such a thing?

150
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:00,096
I mean, that's something you would do.

151
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:01,364
- As soon as he put me on his speakerphone...
- No, no,

152
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,198
- I thought of you.
- That's not something...

153
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,000
and I can't deal with another you.

154
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:06,002
But-but-but don't worry, 'cause...

155
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:07,603
- Well, I am worried!
- It'll be fine. Roland.

156
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:09,873
- This is the guy who's gonna buy the town?
- Just relax.

157
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,875
Yeah, and here's the kicker...

158
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,544
The second one was a hooker too!

159
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,546
Yeah, yeah. Okay, see ya. See ya.

160
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,213
Excuse me, honey,

161
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,682
do you know where I can find Johnny Rose?

162
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:22,551
I got a meeting with this freakin' douche.

163
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,220
The
douchebag is right here.

164
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,653
So... you're leaving.

165
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:43,404
What'd Ted say about that?

166
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:47,190
Uh... he proposed.

167
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:49,210
Really.

168
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:51,186
So what'd you tell him?

169
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:52,826
I told him I was leaving.

170
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:54,444
But if you weren't, you would?

171
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:56,992
'Kay, is this a Barbara
Walter special or something?

172
00:08:57,017 --> 00:08:59,390
I'm leaving. That's it.

173
00:09:00,487 --> 00:09:02,522
You don't seem to be crying about it.

174
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:04,925
I think it's nice you're
going back to your natural habitat.

175
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,928
I'm not a dolphin, Mutt.

176
00:09:07,962 --> 00:09:11,732
You know what I meant. I'm happy for you.

177
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:15,567
Oh. I'm glad you're happy about it.

178
00:09:15,602 --> 00:09:17,136
You know, you should really work on

179
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,338
expanding your emotional
range at some point.

180
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:26,864
So what you're saying is,
he got a little short with you?

181
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:35,254
You, uh, you weren't
quite seeing eye to eye?

182
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:40,692
So, are we gonna sign this puppy or what?

183
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:43,194
Oh, there's a good idea!

184
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:46,631
Andy, I've got the bill of sale right here,

185
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:50,501
and... if you wanna put your John
Hancock right there on that first tab...

186
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,336
Whoa-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba.

187
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:54,994
Hold on a second here. I
think I got a better idea.

188
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,975
- What's that?
- Why don't you come over to the house tonight

189
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:58,910
and try some of Jocelyn's
famous mac and cheese.

190
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:01,780
We can sign this then.

191
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:04,982
- And cheese...
- Or... or we can sign it now,

192
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:08,051
and then we can dive
into some mac and cheese.

193
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:09,753
- Right here, Andy.
- I... I love it.

194
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:12,256
You know, I could really
use a good home-cooked meal.

195
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,192
Well, right after we
sign, we can all have one.

196
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:17,928
And according to Roland
here, Jocelyn's hot stuff.

197
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:19,496
I can't leave town without meeting her.

198
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,665
But then again, if she's that hot

199
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:23,267
what's she doing with this guy?

200
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:27,337
I can't help it if she's got taste!

201
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:29,339
Oh yeah, right. Yeah, taste. Yeah.

202
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:44,487
Well, excuse you in that coat!

203
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:47,556
I know! Jocelyn gave it to me.

204
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,193
What?! Knock-off's are
getting so good these days.

205
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:53,495
Thanks. I can't wait till winter.

206
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,866
I'm gonna feel like Patty LaBelle.

207
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,002
So you did good work, princess.

208
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:03,038
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

209
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:07,108
Perfect attendance,
nothing but glowing reviews.

210
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:11,125
And you must have done
a some number on Mutt.

211
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,414
What do you mean?

212
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:17,719
His hours were up a month
ago, he kept coming anyway.

213
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:20,222
- What?
- Yeah, maybe he just got bored...

214
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:26,037
Or maybe he just likes
pretty girls in hippy hats.

215
00:11:26,526 --> 00:11:29,268
Know what I mean, string bean?

216
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:39,206
That's a lot of bags.

217
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,040
There's still some space
for you though, so don't worry!

218
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:48,180
Yeah... so, um, about New York.

219
00:11:48,717 --> 00:11:52,118
Uh, it sounds amazing,
but I can't do it, so...

220
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:58,092
Wha-what-what-? Why? What?

221
00:11:58,126 --> 00:12:01,780
Uh, I don't think we're on the same page

222
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,664
with what going to New York means.

223
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:09,617
Okay. What does it...
does it mean... something?

224
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,238
Ugh...

225
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,977
I like you.

226
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:21,180
I don't want to like you but I do...

227
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:24,918
And so sharing a space
with you as roommates

228
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,887
isn't gonna work for me.

229
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:33,459
Um... so I'm gonna take a pass, but um...

230
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:34,994
I'm sure you have a lot of friends

231
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:37,063
who would love to live with you.

232
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:39,399
Yeah, not as many as you'd think, so...

233
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:42,451
Um... okay.

234
00:12:43,537 --> 00:12:46,406
Well, thank you for being honest and um...

235
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,144
I wish I could fix this situation.

236
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:54,924
Um... you've been a great friend.

237
00:12:54,949 --> 00:13:00,441
You've been my o-only friend,
so... great, nevertheless.

238
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:04,690
Um... you've made my life here survivable.

239
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:07,660
Survivable. Thank-thank you.

240
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:11,078
That is the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

241
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:17,736
So now I'm gonna go
back to New York... by myself

242
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:21,125
and um... and you can just stay here then.

243
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:26,010
Yeah.

244
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:28,662
I think that's... That's how it has to be.

245
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:33,366
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

246
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:39,390
Okay, bye.

247
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:53,764
Yeah, my granddad...

248
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:55,386
Opened our family's first shelf factory

249
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,321
in a small town just like this one.

250
00:13:57,356 --> 00:14:01,016
I tell you, this place is
bursting with opportunity.

251
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:05,095
Well, bursting seems to
be the operative word.

252
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,398
- Mm! So good!
- Whoa! Slow down there, pal!

253
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:11,534
We got dinner coming
and a big desert after...

254
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:12,502
- Oh.
- Sex in a pan.

255
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:14,571
Oh?

256
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:15,505
Then we'll have dessert!

257
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:21,878
I love it! This guy's
a prince. He's a prince!

258
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:25,815
So... did you try it on?

259
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:27,150
- What?
- The coat.

260
00:14:27,184 --> 00:14:28,518
The one I gave you.

261
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:31,120
Yes. It's... it's great.

262
00:14:31,155 --> 00:14:32,621
- Not too snug?
- Nope.

263
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:34,119
Buttoned right up.

264
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:36,292
It zips.

265
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:39,713
Zips. It zipped right up!

266
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:42,880
You didn't try it on, did you?

267
00:14:42,905 --> 00:14:45,154
No. Oh, why not?

268
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:49,972
It's a great coat! At
least let us see it on you.

269
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:52,608
I gave it away.

270
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,344
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:59,948
It just... it didn't suit me
and... I thought about Ronnie

272
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,318
and you know she could always use some
more feminine pieces in her wardrobe,

273
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:04,052
and so I took it over to
her and she really liked it,

274
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:07,647
so I paid it... forward.

275
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:10,726
Well, Jocelyn, there are...

276
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,261
certain things that are just not done:

277
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:16,476
Smoking in a car with a baby,
unless you crack a window;

278
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:20,780
tipping before tax;
mixing drinks with cola;

279
00:15:20,805 --> 00:15:23,939
and giving away a coat
that doesn't belong to you.

280
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,410
It's open.

281
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:37,231
Hey. Um... I just came to say...

282
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:41,122
That we'll be leaving as soon
as the sale's signed, so...

283
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:42,657
You must be super excited.

284
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:46,260
Yeah.

285
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:49,363
Why did you do all that
extra community service, Mutt?

286
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:51,032
Extra community service?

287
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:55,903
Ronnie said that your
hours ended a long time ago, so...

288
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:57,403
I like to stay active.

289
00:15:57,437 --> 00:15:59,172
Really?

290
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:00,642
What do you want me to say?

291
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:04,510
Well, could it maybe be
because of the fact that you...

292
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:06,412
Enjoy my company?

293
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:08,548
Sure.

294
00:16:08,582 --> 00:16:09,883
Don't you even care that I'm leaving?

295
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,718
Of course I care.

296
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:13,319
- Then what're you doing?
- Why are you yelling?

297
00:16:13,353 --> 00:16:15,773
Okay, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

298
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:20,159
Mutt, why did you do that
extra community service?

299
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:21,360
You know why!

300
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:23,429
Why can't you just say it?

301
00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:38,877
What a lovely surprise!
Come on in. How are ya?

302
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:40,352
I'm just wondering if my dad is here.

303
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:41,539
Yeah, your dad's here.

304
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:43,381
Uh, Johnny?

305
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,750
Your kid's here.

306
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,990
- Does he wanna come in?
- I don't think so.

307
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:56,027
He doesn't wanna come in, okay.

308
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:58,062
David, what're you doing here?

309
00:16:58,097 --> 00:16:59,997
I'm just wondering when you think
we're gonna have the check ready?

310
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:01,299
Well, this is not the time for that, David.

311
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,134
Okay, well, you gave
me this town as a gift,

312
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:05,103
so I feel like I'm owed a little bit more.

313
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:08,005
So fifty percent for me,
fifty percent for you.

314
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,941
David, I'm in the middle
of something important.

315
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:12,610
Well, if I'm gonna be going
to New York, by myself,

316
00:17:12,644 --> 00:17:14,678
then I'm gonna need a
little bit more money.

317
00:17:14,713 --> 00:17:15,847
- Well, that's not gonna happen.
- Well, it has to happen.

318
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:16,447
- It's not gonna happen.
- Well, it has to...

319
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:18,182
Talk to the hand, son,

320
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:20,785
because I've got to watch a pig eat.

321
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:31,128
What did David want?

322
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:34,464
As owner of the town, he wants half.

323
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:37,234
- I tell you, Joc, this freakin' delicious! Mm!
- Everyone's so greedy.

324
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:39,469
Well, let me take your plates.

325
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:41,337
Okay, good.

326
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:42,773
There you go.

327
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:46,276
Um, Andy, you look a little dewy.

328
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,411
- Oh.
- I'll get you some fresh coffee.

329
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:50,647
Oh, good idea.

330
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:52,749
Is it just me or is it this dessert

331
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:54,550
that's-that's making me horny?

332
00:17:56,787 --> 00:17:57,953
I think it's just you, Andy.

333
00:17:57,988 --> 00:18:00,156
- Oh.
- You know what?

334
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,558
I think I should let you guys do the nasty.

335
00:18:02,593 --> 00:18:04,494
And
then sign the contract!

336
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:07,696
You! This guy! This guy!

337
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,298
Oh, he's a prince, isn't he?

338
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:11,633
Yeah, he's a prince. Yup.

339
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:16,947
Okay, well... I think
you are getting bargain...

340
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:18,340
- Really?
- With this, Andy.

341
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:20,758
And to make things easy,

342
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:24,967
I'm going to uh... Put
my signature down first.

343
00:18:24,992 --> 00:18:26,615
How 'bout that?

344
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:30,018
$975,000 dollars! Wow.

345
00:18:30,052 --> 00:18:31,552
That's a heck of a lot of cheddar!

346
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:34,088
Don't you think so, sweet cheeks?

347
00:18:34,123 --> 00:18:36,257
Sweet cheeks? Aren't you
the old fashioned charmer.

348
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:38,426
Oh! Rrrow!

349
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,761
Ready for your signature, Andy.

350
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:43,331
Drum roll please.

351
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:46,134
You know, Andy, $975,000

352
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,402
suddenly seems like such a girly number.

353
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:49,837
What are we doing, honey?

354
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:54,442
I mean, a million...
That's bold, that's sexy.

355
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:56,396
That's quite the
little lady you have there.

356
00:19:00,148 --> 00:19:02,216
You know, I think the little lady's right.

357
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,084
What's an extra $25,000, Andy?

358
00:19:04,118 --> 00:19:06,119
Come on, it's chump change.

359
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:10,524
It's cab fare. $25,000? For you?

360
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,593
Come on. You can cough it up.

361
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:15,587
All right, let's call it
a million! What the heck!

362
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:16,830
Yes! Yes!

363
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:21,234
There we go!

364
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:25,104
Just initial and
sign on the dotted line.

365
00:19:25,138 --> 00:19:26,606
Sign on...

366
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,341
What's happening? What?

367
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,110
Oh my God! Andy! Andy!

368
00:19:31,144 --> 00:19:33,245
We had him, we had him. We had...

369
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,147
Okay, put the pen in his
hand. Sign! He was going to sign.

370
00:19:36,182 --> 00:19:37,349
- Here we go, here we go.
- He was going to sign!

371
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,284
- You, sign!
- Andy?

372
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:42,554
- He wanted to sign, John.
- Here we go.

373
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:43,455
- He wants the town.
- That's it, that's it. Just on the line.

374
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,758
What is happening here?!

375
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,594
What? What happened? Oh no! Andy! What...

376
00:19:48,628 --> 00:19:50,996
Circulation, Johnny!
Circulation in his hand...

377
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,030
Circulation? He can't
even hold a pen, the poor guy.

378
00:19:53,064 --> 00:19:54,399
- There. He needs...
- Circulation.

379
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:55,733
Over the line, over the line.

380
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:57,602
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

381
00:19:57,636 --> 00:20:00,505
What? No! Wait!
No, no, no, no! No, not yet!

382
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:01,572
- Look, he's looking better already.
- Wake up, Andy!

383
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:07,416
People do come out of comas

384
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:10,329
Oh, I'd kill for
a good coma right now.

385
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,737
- Hey.
- Where were you?

386
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:16,354
I was out. So
I'm gonna go keep packing.

387
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:17,861
Wait.

388
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:21,379
John? I don't have the heart.

389
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:23,441
The deal fell through, honey.

390
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:24,707
So when are we leaving?

391
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:29,290
We're not leaving, Alexis.
We didn't sell.

392
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:32,748
We're not leaving?

393
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:35,496
Oh...

394
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:38,387
Are you going to be all right?

395
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,814
I'm pretty sure I'm engaged,

396
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,798
and I'm pretty sure I
just cheated on my fiance.

397
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:51,590
She'll be okay.
Where's your brother?

398
00:20:51,802 --> 00:20:52,968
Who?

399
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:54,059
David!

400
00:21:16,582 --> 00:21:21,082

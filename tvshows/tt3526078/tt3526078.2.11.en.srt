1
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:06,096
Oh, there's a woman in here

2
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:10,421
Who couldn't afford a Persian rug,
so she painted one on her tiled floor.

3
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:13,654
The magazine is
celebrating her ingenuity!

4
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:16,644
Well, it sounds like
a creative solution.

5
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:19,293
A creative solution would be a lobotomy

6
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:22,266
to make one forget
they like nice things.

7
00:00:22,819 --> 00:00:24,489
It's all so bleak.

8
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:27,766
Goodnight, John.

9
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:29,774
Sleep well, sweetheart.

10
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:44,940
David, could you turn that down, please?

11
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,648
As if you think that's what I listen to!

12
00:00:49,576 --> 00:00:52,912
David, Alexis, turn the music down!

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,243
- It's coming from the other side!
- What?

14
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:10,432
Could you turn the music down, please?!

15
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:19,965
Hello?! We're trying to sleep in here!

16
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:21,504
Stop yelling!

17
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,996
I'm trying to turn the music down!

18
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:25,496
Stop banging on the wall!

19
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:27,736
David, stop yelling at your father!

20
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,158
Hello?!

21
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:31,873
Why is everybody screaming?!

22
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,663
Alexis, enough!

23
00:01:33,674 --> 00:01:35,242
The music's too loud!

24
00:01:35,253 --> 00:01:37,435
Then get them to turn it down!

25
00:01:37,446 --> 00:01:39,731
Well, that's what I'm trying to do!

26
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:46,814

27
00:01:54,545 --> 00:01:55,745
John.

28
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:57,451
John!

29
00:01:57,462 --> 00:02:00,323
John, do you have any idea
what a terrible night's sleep

30
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:02,221
does to one's face?

31
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:03,732
What, you couldn't sleep?

32
00:02:03,743 --> 00:02:06,111
How could I sleep with that noise?!

33
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:08,297
What noise? They turned it off.

34
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,726
No, you... you just fell asleep,

35
00:02:10,737 --> 00:02:13,936
and stayed asleep with no
regard for my well being.

36
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:16,895
Now my eyes are puffy. Are they puffy?

37
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:20,048
No, they look like they
usually look, Moira.

38
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:22,007
So now my eyes are usually puffy!

39
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:23,836
Oh Moira, they're fine!

40
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:28,010
These bags are like gypsy
caravans, packed to the brim!

41
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:34,026
Oh my God, this can't be happening.

42
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:37,758
All right, I'll take care of it.

43
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:46,909
Could you turn the music down, please?!

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,339
My wife hasn't slept all night!

45
00:02:51,748 --> 00:02:53,882
Oh! Hey, Johnny.

46
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:55,461
- Roland!
- Hey, uh...

47
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:58,117
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?

48
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,185
Well, we're, uh, doing
some renos on the uh, house,

49
00:03:02,196 --> 00:03:05,000
so we're gonna shack up
here until they're all done.

50
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:09,010
Um honey, don't hog
all the hot water, okay?

51
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:10,401
- Thank you.
- Jocelyn's here?

52
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:12,659
Y-yeah, no, Johnny's here.

53
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,905
Yeah, yes, I will say hi to him for you.

54
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,376
Jocelyn says hi, John.

55
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,615
You didn't hear us last night?

56
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:21,063
- Nope.
- Banging away?

57
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:23,797
Now, whatever you and
the missus do after hours,

58
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:25,131
that's your business, not mine.

59
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:27,444
On the walls Roland, with our fists!

60
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:30,256
And if you're into that kind of
stuff, that doesn't bother me at all.

61
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:31,881
- All right, stop, stop!
- That is fine. What?

62
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:33,341
- Stop it! What are you doing here?!
- Oh!

63
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:35,340
I told you, our basement flooded.

64
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:37,591
You said "renovations."

65
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:42,185
Yes... renovations, because
our basement flooded!

66
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:45,587
What? Yes, you're
absolutely right, honey,

67
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:47,566
it is time that we
asked Johnny to leave.

68
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:49,370
So Johnny, I think you should...

69
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:50,963
Is Jocelyn really there?

70
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,809
Did you hear that, sweetheart?

71
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,901
He doesn't think you're really
here. Would you please tell him?

72
00:03:57,413 --> 00:03:59,916
- Thank you! Satisfied?
- Jocelyn?

73
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:02,751
Okay look, Johnny, unless
you have a warrant, okay?

74
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:04,861
Jocelyn and I are gonna
be shutting our door now.

75
00:04:04,872 --> 00:04:07,197
- Jocelyn?
- Okay, that's fine.

76
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,459
So you think Jocelyn's
at the root of this?

77
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,573
Yeah well, I think obviously
they... they... they... they had a...

78
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:14,893
they had a fight, Moira.

79
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:16,882
You know, I just don't know
how she puts up with him.

80
00:04:16,893 --> 00:04:18,436
And now he's living next door.

81
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:20,205
I've never pretended to like this motel,

82
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:22,152
but at least it provided
a buffer between us,

83
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,072
- and those people!
- Yeah...

84
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,547
How long do you think he'll be here?

85
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:27,165
Well, I hate to think.

86
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:29,438
Oh God, this is the
last thing we need, John.

87
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:31,903
We're barely hanging on as it is!

88
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:34,890
Well, what does that mean,
Moira? "We're barely hanging on?!"

89
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:38,340
I mean living in a space this
limited, is trying enough on a marriage

90
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:41,256
without having Roland
wallowing next door.

91
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:43,287
This is going to bring
us to a breaking point!

92
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:46,091
Oh Moira, it's not gonna
bring us to the breaking point.

93
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:48,841
I think we've done an amazing
job since we've been here.

94
00:04:48,852 --> 00:04:51,606
I mean, I barely remember
an argument between us!

95
00:04:51,617 --> 00:04:52,879
That's my point.

96
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,691
In a room this tiny,
we've just got to ignore

97
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:59,559
the little irritants of the
other, or you'd go insane!

98
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:02,151
Little irritants? What uh...

99
00:05:02,162 --> 00:05:04,939
What little irritants?
I have little irritants?

100
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,375
Yes, we all do.

101
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:08,766
Peccadilloes, cloying habits.

102
00:05:08,777 --> 00:05:10,108
Like what, for instance?

103
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,853
All right, John. I...

104
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:15,468
I drink a little too much tea sometimes.

105
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,193
And that's it for you? You uh...

106
00:05:18,204 --> 00:05:19,529
You drink tea?

107
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:22,257
Well, it calms me, so
I suppose you would say

108
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:25,567
that's because I'm inclined
to get nervous or insecure.

109
00:05:25,578 --> 00:05:28,994
No, I would say you're
sometimes a little defensive,

110
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:32,286
and uh, perhaps a tad paranoid.

111
00:05:32,637 --> 00:05:36,733
That would only be after you've taken
that condescending father tone with me.

112
00:05:36,744 --> 00:05:38,670
- Father tone?
- There it is.

113
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:40,215
You think I have a father tone?

114
00:05:40,226 --> 00:05:44,539
John, I wish you could hear yourself
talk. But of course you never do.

115
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,804
And that's the other thing I
guess, I never listen to myself?

116
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,666
Look, it's by not engaging
in this kind of tit-for-tat

117
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:55,764
that we keep our marriage afloat.

118
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:59,592
And you have no faults,
other than drinking tea?!

119
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:03,028
John, I just admitted that
I can get a little defensive.

120
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,261
But only when you act like a big child!

121
00:06:05,272 --> 00:06:06,842
I act like a child?

122
00:06:06,853 --> 00:06:10,631
Yes John, and now is not the time
for you to throw one of your tantrums!

123
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:12,855
Moira, of the two of us,

124
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:15,399
I'm not the one who throws tantrums!

125
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,071
I will not engage.

126
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:19,925
I do not want to see
him get the better of us.

127
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:22,111
And I'm sorry, obviously
this has worked you up

128
00:06:22,122 --> 00:06:24,982
into some kind of... fit of pique.

129
00:06:26,128 --> 00:06:27,579
Okay, you know what?

130
00:06:29,717 --> 00:06:30,917
I need some air.

131
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:33,790
That's another thing Mr. Rose,
you never finish your fights.

132
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:35,630
Oh, this one's finished!

133
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:52,068
Stevie, you look like you would know
about affordable housing. Is this legit?

134
00:06:53,222 --> 00:06:57,194
Uh... it's an ad for an apartment.

135
00:06:57,205 --> 00:06:58,932
I know, it's cute though, right?

136
00:06:58,943 --> 00:07:03,550
I wouldn't really describe any
apartment as cute in this town.

137
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:08,470
Hi...

138
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:10,352
Um, hi.

139
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,843
There's a collection of undershirts

140
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:16,491
hang drying outside of my room.

141
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,788
Um, is there any way
they could be removed,

142
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:21,414
or is there like, a Texas Chainsaw movie

143
00:07:21,425 --> 00:07:23,418
being filmed out there
that I'm not aware of?

144
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:26,000
Actually, Roland is
staying here for a few days.

145
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:27,479
- Ew.
- That's disgusting.

146
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,494
What's going on over
here? Let me see that.

147
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:30,974
What is this?

148
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:36,475
"Charming studio apartment
for rent in lower SC."

149
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:41,329
What's "lower SC?" I thought this
town was just one long street.

150
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:43,699
I am thinking about getting a place.

151
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,409
I have some money coming
in, and it's just...

152
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,896
It's not really a cute look to
be this age, and live at home.

153
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:52,170
No offense, David.

154
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,460
Okay, it's not like I have
a lot of say in the matter.

155
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:56,166
M'kay well, you're a full grown man,

156
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:57,419
- who's much older than me,
- Hmmm.

157
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,630
- living at home. So it's just a little
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:07:58,641 --> 00:08:01,059
- bit embarrassing.
- Mmm, "available immediately."

159
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,809
I wonder if you could move out tonight?

160
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,762
Uh no, because I'm gonna be using my
half of the room as a guest bedroom.

161
00:08:07,773 --> 00:08:10,474
Ooh, better yet, you could sublet it.

162
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:13,501
I'm sure there's plenty of vagrants
looking for temporary housing.

163
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:15,622
Speaking of which, David,
I'm gonna need you to come

164
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:17,005
and look at the apartment with me.

165
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:19,077
Okay, why would I do that?

166
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:23,452
Because David, as an
attractive, single female,

167
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:26,882
I don't feel comfortable going
to look at an apartment by myself!

168
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:29,010
Well, what if the person
who's showing you the apartment

169
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:31,622
is like, a super cute
single real estate guy?

170
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:34,937
Mmmm... that person
doesn't exist in this town.

171
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:38,763
Okay, well, if that's the case,
then David, you have to come with me.

172
00:08:38,774 --> 00:08:40,226
And if I like the place,

173
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:43,365
then you can have the whole
motel room to yourself, okay?

174
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:44,576
Okay.

175
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,036
She's nuts. Um, if you could...

176
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:50,016
just figure out the undershirt

177
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:53,541
situation, there's just so many
of them, and it's a lot for me.

178
00:08:53,552 --> 00:08:55,473
- Bye!
- You know, for my eyes.

179
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:56,735
Mm-hmm.

180
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:08,925
- Hey, Johnny.
- Oh, Jocelyn. Hi.

181
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:11,197
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

182
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,194
- Really?
- Yes.

183
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:16,273
I couldn't help but notice
that you seemed a little...

184
00:09:16,284 --> 00:09:18,156
sad sack-y today.

185
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,718
Sad sack-y?

186
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,576
Well, maybe that's
because your husband is

187
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:26,176
occupying the room
next to us at the motel.

188
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,710
I thought he might end up there.

189
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:30,171
That's where we had our honeymoon.

190
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:31,973
Had a lot of great times in that room.

191
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:33,715
I don't think this is one of them.

192
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:35,961
He was playing "Don't Cry Out Loud",

193
00:09:35,972 --> 00:09:37,906
loud at two in the morning.

194
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,282
I'm so sorry.

195
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:41,622
It's our wedding song.

196
00:09:41,877 --> 00:09:43,882
It was actually the first
song that we ever made...

197
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:46,725
Okay, I really don't
need the details on that.

198
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:48,303
Listen, I would ask you to sit,

199
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:51,342
- but I... I am not...
- Absolutely, yes!

200
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:54,718
So...

201
00:09:55,148 --> 00:09:56,348
- you two are
- Yeah.

202
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:59,908
- going through a little bit of a thing?
- Had a tiff, and uh,

203
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,605
I just said, I need some space.

204
00:10:01,616 --> 00:10:03,945
Well, I'm glad you have your space,

205
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:06,224
and I'm glad Roland has his space,

206
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:08,573
I'll tell you who's now
having a major problem

207
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:10,218
- with their space.
- Okay, Johnny.

208
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:12,841
Sometimes it's a lot
easier to blame others

209
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:15,115
than it is to maybe
kinda turn it inwards

210
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:16,555
on ourselves, isn't it?

211
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,427
Meaning...

212
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:24,132
Well, it's kinda obvious that you and
Moira are a little bit rocky right now.

213
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:26,356
No, no, things are not rocky.

214
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:29,476
Things are not rocky, and if they
are, it's because your husband

215
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:31,077
- is driving us insane!
- So you're telling me that

216
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,531
there are no issues

217
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:36,520
- between you two right now?
- No! No! No issues.

218
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:40,949
Well, by "issues," if
you mean p-peccadilloes,

219
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,270
- if you mean little irritants.
- Mmmm.

220
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:45,481
Maybe.

221
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:48,089
- Uh-huh.
- But uh no, we're...

222
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,735
- we're good.
- Good.

223
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,167
Err, right this way.

224
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:58,264
As you can see, it's light and breezy.

225
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:01,295
And by breezy, I mean there's
a slight but steady draft

226
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:03,303
I'm told you only notice in the winter.

227
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:05,709
This is so cute for me.

228
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,567
Oh, and there's a lovely window here

229
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:09,235
through which you can
see all of the town.

230
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:11,181
The cafe, the garage,

231
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:14,394
a tree of some kind just uh, over there.

232
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:16,154
This is cute, right?

233
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,775
I think this is super cute.

234
00:11:18,786 --> 00:11:20,650
Wait, is it cute?

235
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:24,716
'Cause I know that it's
light, and spacious, and...

236
00:11:24,927 --> 00:11:26,997
airy in here, but I just
wasn't sure if it was cute.

237
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:28,259
Oh, it's cute.

238
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,866
Are these original moldings?

239
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:31,925
Yes, but we can rip those out.

240
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:34,504
Okay well, I'm the one that
should be asking the questions.

241
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:35,941
Okay, be my guest.

242
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:37,987
Okay, so...

243
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:42,401
When does um...

244
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:45,096
Is this a functioning fireplace?

245
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:49,022
Yes, we found an incinerated
squirrel carcass there last week.

246
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:51,349
- Ah.
- Um, what are you doing, David?

247
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,409
You wanted my help, so I'm helping.

248
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:55,290
Mm, okay.

249
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:56,501
What's the rent?

250
00:11:56,512 --> 00:11:59,866
Uh, they want $275, but
I think they're dreaming.

251
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:01,578
- A week?
- No, no, no, a month.

252
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:03,623
But again, I think
we can talk them down.

253
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:08,735
Wait, $275 a month for this? That's
cheaper than my P.O. Box in New York.

254
00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:10,859
Do you think I should take it?

255
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:15,628
Well, I mean, it is... it is very old.

256
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:19,816
I think that I would like
to see the lease agreement.

257
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:21,100
I thought you'd never ask!

258
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:26,289
Ugh, you know, it actually kind
of reminds me of your old um...

259
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,654
office space that you
had in the West Village.

260
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,794
- Mm-hmm.
- Remember?

261
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:33,344
- Yep!
- So cute.

262
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,834
You know what I think brought
all this on? That darn election!

263
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:40,813
It's really hard on couples.
I mean, don't get me wrong,

264
00:12:40,824 --> 00:12:43,236
I really appreciate how
involved Roland wants to be

265
00:12:43,252 --> 00:12:45,532
in my campaign, it's
just that sometimes,

266
00:12:45,543 --> 00:12:47,033
he can be sooo...

267
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:50,685
- Irritating? Obnoxious?
- No. I was gonna say sensitive.

268
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:52,551
- Oh, sensitive.
- Especially when I wanna

269
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:54,059
do something on my own.

270
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,173
Ohhh! Do you really think
he's obnoxious and irritating?

271
00:12:58,184 --> 00:13:00,947
No! No, no, no, I was
just trying to imagine

272
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,907
- what you know, you were feeling, no.
- Well, I feel frustrated a lot.

273
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,642
You know, you try to have a
rational conversation with him,

274
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:11,157
and he just gets all
like, stubborn and selfish.

275
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:12,846
And then he acts like
you're the one behaving like

276
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:15,238
- a child! Right? Yeah, exactly.
- Exactly!

277
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:18,418
Words get... get used,
and twisted around,

278
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:20,633
and yet, he uses that against you.

279
00:13:20,644 --> 00:13:23,540
- Yes, that is so Roland!
- And you get the reputation

280
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:29,071
for being hot-headed, and he
gets to push every button he can!

281
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:31,222
You are so right!

282
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:34,630
You know, I thought that I
might be ready to forgive him,

283
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:37,761
but I think he needs a couple
more nights at that motel.

284
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:43,027
But, on the other hand...

285
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:48,719
maybe it's through your forgiveness
that you teach him a lesson.

286
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,441
Right, and... and the
sooner you forgive him,

287
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:54,648
then... then the better
it's gonna be for... for you.

288
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:00,759
Roland!

289
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:03,171
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

290
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,423
Oh! Moira, this isn't a good time, um...

291
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:09,869
Jocelyn and I are about to make brunch.

292
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,514
You can give up the act.

293
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:13,083
You and I need to talk.

294
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,220
Close the door honey, will you?
You're lettin' my flies out.

295
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,944
Ugh! It's time for you
to go home and apologize.

296
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:28,387
Oh, okay.

297
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,702
I'll do that. Um...

298
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,783
Just one question. Where's Johnny?

299
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:35,308
I imagine he's at work.

300
00:14:35,872 --> 00:14:38,168
'Cause he seemed pretty
angry this morning.

301
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:41,676
I don't know, maybe you need
to go home and apologize.

302
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:45,690
Sorry sweetheart, these
walls are pretty thin.

303
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:47,276
Oh yes, I know.

304
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:51,476
The only reason John and I had
words is because we were exhausted,

305
00:14:51,496 --> 00:14:53,891
- from being kept up all night!
- Mmm.

306
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:58,089
It seems someone in the motel was
playing loud music until 4 A.M.!

307
00:14:59,004 --> 00:15:02,312
I'm sorry, are you
complaining about the quality

308
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:06,411
of the free lodging that I
arranged for you this past year?

309
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:08,875
I think we're very
courteous guests, Roland,

310
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:11,051
and have tried to
contribute to this town,

311
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:12,864
in whatever way we could.

312
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:16,913
This town, which is quite
frankly, woefully mismanaged.

313
00:15:16,924 --> 00:15:19,986
Oh, ugh, ew! I hate that!

314
00:15:19,997 --> 00:15:24,968
Eww! That is just the kind of
arrogance that I can't stand!

315
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:28,114
You come in here, and you
think you know everything!

316
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,359
Oooh! Ohhhh!

317
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,811
No, but I think if I was in your
position, I would be open to new ideas.

318
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:38,435
Oh! Right! Of course you would.

319
00:15:38,446 --> 00:15:40,984
- I would!
- Sure. Hah! Yeah. Mmmm...

320
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:45,763
Hello, everyone! I'm Moira
Rose, and I know famous people,

321
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:48,946
so I really can't talk
to the common folk.

322
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:50,934
Excuse me all, coming through!

323
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:54,819
So I'm assuming this place
comes fully furnished?

324
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:59,941
No, this is all completely staged.

325
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:03,373
Hmm, it must be very expensive
to furnish a place like this.

326
00:16:03,384 --> 00:16:05,272
Ah, not really if you
get it second hand.

327
00:16:05,283 --> 00:16:07,397
Or uh, maybe you get
up early on Tuesdays,

328
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:10,904
which is garbage day, and
find a discarded couch or sofa.

329
00:16:10,915 --> 00:16:14,238
Mm-hmm, um well, you know what, I
don't even really need that much stuff.

330
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:18,100
I kinda like the
minimalist look anyway, so.

331
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,212
It's very quiet in here, Ray,
it's like, alarmingly quiet.

332
00:16:22,223 --> 00:16:25,225
The apartment was soundproofed
by the previous owner.

333
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:28,079
But the irony is the people
next door are completely deaf,

334
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,847
so you could literally scream for
hours, and no one would hear you.

335
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:34,961
Did you hear that?

336
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:38,341
You could scream for hours,
and no one would hear you.

337
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:41,700
Okay well, think about how much
fun that will be for parties, David.

338
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:44,347
Um, and what about parking?

339
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:46,901
Okay, you don't... you
don't even have a car!

340
00:16:46,912 --> 00:16:48,809
Oh my god, if you want
the place so badly, David,

341
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,923
- why don't you just say it?!
- Who says I want it?

342
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:52,134
So you don't want it?

343
00:16:53,671 --> 00:16:54,941
- No.
- So if I said that

344
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:57,171
I didn't want the place, you
wouldn't... you wouldn't want it?

345
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,010
- Okay, so you don't want the place?
- Okay, I'm just trying to figure out if

346
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:01,557
- you want the place!
- Oh, okay, okay.

347
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:03,967
I think I know what all
the hesitation is about.

348
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:06,980
Yes, someone did take their
own life in this space,

349
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:09,264
but the good news is, we've
replaced the ceiling fan,

350
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:10,527
it's now a break-away model.

351
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:12,987
And to answer your question,
yes, there is parking.

352
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,457
Uh, oh, and they also allow cats.

353
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:20,735
Oh? Oh? You wanna drop the gloves?
Let's drop the gloves, Roland.

354
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:23,913
You are an emotionally stunted,
self absorbed man-child.

355
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:25,723
You lord this counterfeit power of yours

356
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,962
over others like a schoolyard bully!

357
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:30,808
Okay, well you're a
phony baloney blowhard,

358
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:34,099
who's desperately scared of being
thought of as a regular person!

359
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,798
I used to be a regular person!

360
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:39,258
You're just a stuck up pencil
skirt with clown makeup,

361
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:41,582
and a janitor's mop on your head!

362
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:46,609
You are an inexplicably cocky imbecile!

363
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,870
Your marriage is as
blighted as this town,

364
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:51,245
and you have no one
to blame but yourself!

365
00:17:51,472 --> 00:17:53,249
- Whoa...
- Oh.

366
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,208
- Well, hold on.
- I went too far.

367
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:56,511
- Yeah.
- Well...

368
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:58,378
- Well, I mean, come on.
- In the spirit of things.

369
00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:00,606
Yeah but still, that was kind of...

370
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:02,038
over the line.

371
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:05,334
I like Jocelyn,

372
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:08,781
And I know you two have a
very special relationship.

373
00:18:09,928 --> 00:18:12,492
Well, we... I mean, we
have our differences.

374
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:13,853
Oh God, who doesn't?

375
00:18:14,037 --> 00:18:16,689
I was... I was just riffing.

376
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:55,539
John?

377
00:18:56,421 --> 00:18:59,133
Oh sweetheart, I
didn't mean to wake you.

378
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:02,485
Don't hear any music next door.

379
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:04,664
No, I think he tuckered himself out.

380
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:07,144
Oh, well, that's good, that's good.

381
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:11,125
I suppose he just needed
to spout off for a while.

382
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:13,743
Yeah well, Jocelyn will
be glad to hear that.

383
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:16,057
She just came to pick him up.

384
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:18,150
- Really?
- Yeah.

385
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:21,110
I think she just needed some alone time,

386
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:22,718
you know, to clear her head.

387
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,828
That's understandable.

388
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:26,353
Hmm.

389
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:31,041
It's unfortunate they can't
communicate those needs to each other.

390
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:34,496
Yeah well, they don't have what we have.

391
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:38,334
I can't argue with that.

392
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,989
I thought you said Jocelyn
came back to make up!

393
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:48,832
She did!

394
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:51,375
That happens to be their wedding song.

395
00:20:00,175 --> 00:20:02,449
Just admit that you wanted the place.

396
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,489
I was just asking questions

397
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,941
to help you make the right decision.

398
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:08,719
Well, you're a terrible liar, David.

399
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,251
It's a pretty good deal, though.

400
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,089
Seriously though, would
you wanna live in a house

401
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,783
where someone killed themselves?

402
00:20:14,794 --> 00:20:16,165
I could almost guarantee you

403
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:18,035
that someone's killed
themselves in this room.

404
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:19,661
Ew, David!

405
00:20:20,462 --> 00:20:22,655
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

406
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:25,368
Ugh!

407
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:33,914
You know, sometimes
at night, I see things.

408
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:36,597
Oh my God, David!

409
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,320
Yeah, yeah. Like...

410
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:41,082
dark things.

411
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:45,218
Like sometimes there's this old
woman that paces back and forth

412
00:20:45,229 --> 00:20:48,633
by your bed, waving her
hands over your face.

413
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,512
I don't think her bony fingers
ever touch your mouth, though.

414
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:56,159
Mom?

415
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,191
Do you ever wake up with chapped lips?

416
00:21:00,194 --> 00:21:01,440
Dad!

417
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:02,764
Dad's dead.

418
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:05,150
Ohh, you're such a dick, David!

419
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:14,039
Stop!

420
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:17,760

This is the number that we are after.

Now if you'll excuse us, we

We're in our store.

We await your reply.

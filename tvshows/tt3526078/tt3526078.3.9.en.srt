1
00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:02,334
John, do you have the car keys?

2
00:00:02,633 --> 00:00:04,905
Do I have the car keys? No. No.

3
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:08,242
But according to the sign-out sheet,

4
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:10,310
I was the last person to use the car.

5
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:12,079
Well, that's not very helpful, John.

6
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:14,131
You're the only one
using the sign-out sheet.

7
00:00:14,156 --> 00:00:15,139
Well, that's not true.

8
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:16,919
Stevie's got her name on the sheet.

9
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:18,709
Wait a minute, why is
Stevies name on the sheet?

10
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:20,013
She's got her own car.

11
00:00:20,047 --> 00:00:22,081
David! Do you know
where the car keys are?

12
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:23,449
Yeah, I have them.

13
00:00:23,484 --> 00:00:25,919
Oh, well, then why isn't your
name on the sign-out sheet.

14
00:00:25,953 --> 00:00:28,154
Because you're the only one
using that sign-out sheet.

15
00:00:28,188 --> 00:00:30,089
David, I need the car keys,

16
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:31,891
your father is driving
me to Thornbridge.

17
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:33,760
I'm driving you to Thornbridge?

18
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:36,062
To that municipalities conference. Yes.

19
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,830
I thought Roland offered to drive you.

20
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:39,666
Oh, he did. But no thanks.

21
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,701
I can't take four hours
in the truck with Roland

22
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:43,303
and Lynyrd Skynyrd.

23
00:00:43,337 --> 00:00:45,004
Okay, Alexis and I need the car,

24
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,906
we're running some errands
for the store today.

25
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:48,308
Um, since when?

26
00:00:48,342 --> 00:00:50,276
Uh, since I need help for a pick-up.

27
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:51,978
And Mom clearly already has a lift,

28
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:53,813
and I'm pretty sure
parents are supposed to

29
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:55,415
put their children before themselves.

30
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:56,701
Oh really? No.

31
00:00:56,726 --> 00:00:59,352
If airplane safety videos
have taught me anything, David,

32
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:01,321
it's that a mother puts
her on own mask on first.

33
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:04,857
Ah, see, and that's precisely
why we have the sign-out sheet.

34
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:06,292
For this kind of dispute.

35
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:07,694
Okay. Fine.

36
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,699
Now my name is on the list.

37
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:15,935
And there's a sheep farm that's
expecting us in 20 minutes

38
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,604
for a pick-up of some wool throws.

39
00:01:17,638 --> 00:01:19,072
No, no, no. No, no.

40
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:20,873
Your mother already
expressed a verbal intention

41
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:22,308
to use the car.

42
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:24,444
Okay, we're gonna have the
car back in a few hours.

43
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:25,845
Okay. Well, I might
need it for a few hours

44
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:26,996
after that though.

45
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:28,386
Fine, we'll just keep it for the day.

46
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:29,268
John!

47
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:31,093
You people are abusing the system.

48
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:34,854
It's not a difficult system.

49
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:36,446
Moira, look at this.

50
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,911
Under purpose of trip
he writes "driving."

51
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:53,683
Whoa, hold it right there.

52
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:56,340
I want to see the look on your face

53
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:58,387
when you walk into your
first regional association

54
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:00,723
of municipalities conference.

55
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:02,837
And there it is.

56
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,347
Ah, name tags.

57
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:07,878
Let's get suited up.

58
00:02:07,913 --> 00:02:09,280
Thank you but no, Roland.

59
00:02:09,314 --> 00:02:11,415
I won't wear anything
with an adhesive backing.

60
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,050
Ah-ha.

61
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:15,386
Oh, hey, Moira, look over there.

62
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,254
You see that guy over
there? The well dressed one?

63
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:19,290
That's Gavin Mccrae.

64
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:21,025
Mayor of Thornbridge.

65
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:23,961
Hm. You mean the one serving
drinks to the other people?

66
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:29,400
Okay. Maybe he's the
other guy over there.

67
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:30,901
Also very well dressed.

68
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:33,637
Well, now you've identified
the catering staff.

69
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,875
Moira please, this is RAMC.

70
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,243
These are the people

71
00:02:39,277 --> 00:02:40,878
with their fingers on
the button of everything

72
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:44,548
from road salting to
quarry inspection to...

73
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,951
- water tower repair.
- Hmm.

74
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:49,153
I mean, it's really kinda scary

75
00:02:49,187 --> 00:02:51,589
that we're all in here under one roof.

76
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:53,491
Oh, it's frightening. Yes.

77
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:55,359
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna need you in there,

78
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:58,162
by my side when we
make this budget pitch.

79
00:02:58,196 --> 00:02:59,997
You don't have to
worry about me, Roland.

80
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:03,234
If there is anyone at
this fabulous little confab

81
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:06,804
who know how to work a room
of fragile egos, it's me.

82
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:08,772
I once hosted the non-televised portion

83
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:10,875
of the People Choice Awards.

84
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:16,814
This is a actually a great idea, David.

85
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:19,316
Consolidating all of your
products under one label

86
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:22,152
instills brand recognition
and create synergy.

87
00:03:22,187 --> 00:03:24,221
Um, I'm sure you're very excited

88
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:25,623
about all the new words you're learning

89
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:27,391
in your high school
intro to business course,

90
00:03:27,425 --> 00:03:30,194
but I think a more effective
use of your time right now,

91
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:32,566
would be to go and get the hand cream

92
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,266
that I asked you to get ten minutes ago.

93
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,834
I got the hand cream.

94
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,469
Yeah. The box of hand cream.

95
00:03:38,503 --> 00:03:40,371
I asked you to get
the box of hand cream,

96
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:43,307
not sample the hand cream.

97
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:45,709
That's like 53 pounds.

98
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:47,878
Why are you here?

99
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:49,713
You know what I think
would be really cute

100
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:52,783
is if I had my own little
label, like, under your label.

101
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:54,885
- Yeah...
- And I can sell festival wear,

102
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,155
and I can sell like hair
feathers and body jewelry...

103
00:03:58,189 --> 00:03:59,657
David.

104
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:05,029
Wow, things are really
coming together in here.

105
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:06,864
Oh, um, we're actually not open yet.

106
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:08,632
But that's so sweet. Thank you.

107
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,668
We've been working very hard.

108
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:12,202
Well, I'm actually not here to shop.

109
00:04:12,237 --> 00:04:13,771
I'm-I'm Patrick.

110
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:16,106
I'm just dropping off
David's business license.

111
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:19,176
Oh, isn't that just the cutest thing.

112
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,611
Um, David's in the back.

113
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:22,580
But I am Alexis,

114
00:04:22,614 --> 00:04:24,615
and I'm currently studding business,

115
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:27,284
and I'm David's sister
and life coach so.

116
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,453
Well, it's great to meet you, Alexis.

117
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:32,823
Uh, I'm sorry if my hands are too soft.

118
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:35,759
I've just been sampling
a lot of product.

119
00:04:35,794 --> 00:04:38,388
So... really soft.

120
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:41,084
They are.

121
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:44,668
Excuse me, Mrs. Rose,

122
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:46,437
if I may, just a couple of questions.

123
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:49,573
Were you surprised to get
such a big funding boost

124
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,408
for the municipalities?

125
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:52,943
That was quite the speech.

126
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:54,812
Oh... Thank you. Thank you.

127
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:57,648
What did I do?

128
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:59,249
Well, I was simply
channeled someone who cares,

129
00:04:59,284 --> 00:05:01,685
but if you insist on referring
to me as the linchpin.

130
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,187
I'll take that.

131
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,922
That's right. We're...

132
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:07,791
We're just a couple linchpins here.

133
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:09,827
I'm Roland Schitt, Moira's boss...

134
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:11,295
Yes, I'll I'm the ingenue here.

135
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:13,130
A total babe in the political woods.

136
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:15,532
That's true. You know,
this is her first RAMC.

137
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:19,203
But I think under my wing,
she's-she's learning to fly.

138
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:20,713
- I've been mayor for ten years...
- Thank you.

139
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:23,474
And I did... Okay, we'll talk
when you have more time do...

140
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:26,310
There she is! The woman of the hour!

141
00:05:26,344 --> 00:05:28,312
Oh my God, now they're
crowning me with titles.

142
00:05:28,346 --> 00:05:30,381
Join us for drinks in the diamond club.

143
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:31,882
In the diamond club?

144
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,584
Hm. That sounds grand.

145
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:35,119
It's the hotel bar.

146
00:05:35,153 --> 00:05:36,920
They have a special RAMC cocktail.

147
00:05:36,955 --> 00:05:38,922
It's a sparkling white Russian.

148
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:40,924
The trick is to get it
down before it curdles.

149
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,826
As appealing as you
make that sounds, Roland,

150
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:44,595
I think I'll just go to my room.

151
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:46,230
Oh, come on!

152
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:48,666
Look, I never get this kind of...

153
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:53,971
I mean, our town doesn't get
recognized like this very often

154
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:56,373
and this time it's for
something really positive.

155
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:59,021
Okay. One drink.

156
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:01,311
This means a lot to you, doesn't it?

157
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:02,946
Yes, and to you.

158
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:09,493
Moira! Moira! Moira!

159
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:11,455
- Isn't it so soft?
- It is.

160
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:13,290
Whoa, might be tying it
a little too tight there.

161
00:06:13,324 --> 00:06:15,826
Uh, that is actually cat hair.

162
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,761
There's a Himalayan
breeder up the street

163
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:19,496
that knits them for us. Hi.

164
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:22,366
Hi. I'm just dropping
off your business license.

165
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,268
And activating my allergies.

166
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:26,537
Oh, In that case you should
probably take that off.

167
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:28,038
- Yeah. Like now!
- Oh. Oh!

168
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:31,141
Isn't that the sweet
thing, that he framed it.

169
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:33,844
Um. It is very sweet.

170
00:06:33,878 --> 00:06:35,212
Thank you, Patrick.

171
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:36,947
Actually, they... they all come framed.

172
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:38,382
Okay, thank God.

173
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,783
Because I was just
thinking that this frame

174
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:41,652
is a little too corporate for my brand.

175
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:43,320
David, I was just about to sample

176
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:46,190
the unisex Mennonite cologne on Patrick.

177
00:06:46,224 --> 00:06:47,825
Um, that's not a sample.

178
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:50,027
And you've sampled half
the store at this point.

179
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:52,696
So we need to sell all this stuff.

180
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:54,565
Okay, well I flattened out the lip balm.

181
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,133
So no one's gonna notice.

182
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,668
There's a lot of stuff in here, David.

183
00:06:57,702 --> 00:06:59,636
You don't wanna spend
too much money up front.

184
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:02,172
Yeah, that's not good, David.

185
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:03,707
You have to be prepared
to survive a full year

186
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:05,242
without making any profit.

187
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:07,665
Actually, the textbooks
now say eighteen months.

188
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:09,480
Well, what are the textbooks saying

189
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:12,516
about curating a selection
of products from local vendors

190
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,419
and selling them on
consignment in a one-stop-shop

191
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:16,787
retail environment,

192
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:19,623
that benefits the
vendor and the customer?

193
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:22,926
Well, I don't have my textbook on me.

194
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:24,428
I stand corrected.

195
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,598
Listen, if you need
help, I-I'm happy to help.

196
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:29,900
Why? Alexis is here helping.

197
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:32,736
Well, no. If Patrick has
offered to move all the boxes,

198
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:34,138
then I think we should let him.

199
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:35,539
Is that what I offered?

200
00:07:35,573 --> 00:07:37,608
Okay, well, thank you, Patrick.

201
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:38,976
You're welcome.

202
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,145
Um, okay. So you can start by moving

203
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:43,147
all of those big things of hand cream.

204
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:51,455
What?

205
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:56,894
It's all so unbelievable, John!

206
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:59,396
I had forgotten what
it was like to be feted.

207
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,731
Moira?

208
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:03,834
What?! I can, I can
hardly hear you, John!

209
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:08,238
The cheering and accolades are
drowning out your gentle voice.

210
00:08:08,273 --> 00:08:10,607
Oh, I take it things went well?

211
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:12,409
I'm a game-changer, Jo...

212
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:13,944
Hey... oh! Uh...

213
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:15,746
Oh, Gavin's brought out the hard stuff.

214
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,015
So darling, I must sign off.

215
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:19,950
All right, well, have fun, sweetheart,

216
00:08:19,984 --> 00:08:21,952
and don't get too carried away.

217
00:08:21,986 --> 00:08:24,054
I'm networking, John!

218
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,256
Do you know that I'm
actually good at this!

219
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,691
Who are you talking to?

220
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:29,092
It's my husband!

221
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:32,462
Was that for me?

222
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:33,864
Why am I-why am I getting booed?

223
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:35,933
That's... Wait! That's my man, Johnny!

224
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:37,835
Hey Johnny, it's Roland!

225
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:41,004
Hey, we're all here at RAMC!

226
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,273
You should be here,
Mary-something is here...

227
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:45,409
Gavin is here... The road salt guy...

228
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:47,077
Yeah. Okay, Roland.

229
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:49,179
Good. I'm having a bit
of a night myself here.

230
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:50,581
Come on!

231
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,015
Stop, I have to talk to my husband.

232
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,383
John. John.

233
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:55,819
Moira, you know, it might
be time for a coffee.

234
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:58,088
And I'm gonna let you go now.

235
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:59,656
And have fun, sweetheart.

236
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:01,258
We'll see you in the morning.

237
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:02,659
Goodbye, phone call!

238
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:04,061
Goodbye, my darling.

239
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:05,626
All right. Goodnight, sweetheart.

240
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:07,798
Oh, Moira, by the way, I
just picked up the new...

241
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,302
Okay.

242
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:25,473
John, shut the blinds.

243
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:29,288
Johnny, please.

244
00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:38,897
- Moira?
- Hm?

245
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:42,101
- Oh
- Oh

246
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:45,987
Roland! What are you doing in my room?

247
00:09:46,706 --> 00:09:48,807
What are you talking
about? This is my room.

248
00:09:48,842 --> 00:09:51,710
Well, what the (Bleep)
are you doing in your room?

249
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:53,812
Well, I was trying to sleep.

250
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:55,914
Until you started pounding on the door,

251
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:59,218
telling me to whip up a salmon plate.

252
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,688
I finally let you in,
you flaked out on the bed.

253
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:04,189
Oh my God.

254
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:08,727
Are you naked under there?

255
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:12,197
Honey, what I do in
the privacy of my sheets

256
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:13,932
is my own business.

257
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:17,115
Oh, no. No God, no.

258
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:18,604
Oh, God, no.

259
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:20,536
- No, dear God.
- Welcome to RAMC.

260
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:24,209
Oh, my God No!

261
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:32,618
Jocelyn!

262
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:36,054
Almost didn't recognize you over there.

263
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:37,823
Hey Johnny.

264
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:39,291
It's been a morning,

265
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:40,692
but I don't have to tell you that.

266
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:43,562
Oh, I'm sorry. You've
had a tough morning?

267
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:46,932
You're handling this
way better than I am.

268
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:49,134
Handling what better?

269
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:53,906
Roland and Moira, sleeping together.

270
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,374
What?!

271
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:57,109
At the conference last night.

272
00:10:57,143 --> 00:10:58,844
Yeah. No, no!

273
00:10:58,878 --> 00:11:01,213
Let's just go back to
that previous sentence.

274
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:05,150
Ah, when you say they slept together...

275
00:11:05,185 --> 00:11:07,186
Well, Roland says that they just slept

276
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,922
- in the same bed together. 
- Ah-ha.

277
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:12,090
And he says that nothing happened,

278
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,561
so I'm just trying to, you
know, process all of this.

279
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:17,268
Oh yes. Well...

280
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:19,128
Aren't we all.

281
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:22,134
I mean, I'm-I'm hearing
about this for the first time.

282
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:24,169
Moira didn't tell you?

283
00:11:24,204 --> 00:11:25,671
You know, we chatted this morning

284
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:27,372
about how successful the night was,

285
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:28,740
but sleeping with your husband

286
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:30,442
didn't really come up
as one of the reasons

287
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:33,045
the night was so successful.

288
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:34,713
And we probably shouldn't read anything

289
00:11:34,747 --> 00:11:36,114
into the fact that for some reason,

290
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:38,350
Moira decided to hide this from you.

291
00:11:38,384 --> 00:11:40,352
Oh, no, no. I wouldn't say "hide."

292
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:41,829
No, no.

293
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:44,923
Because Moira was so exhausted
when she got in this morning.

294
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,693
Maybe she was exhausted
because she was up all night

295
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:50,395
- with her mitts all over...
- No! No. No! No.

296
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,865
I know Moira and she would
never in a million years ever

297
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,734
sleep with...

298
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:57,135
Anyone. Else.

299
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,238
It's just that I know what it's like

300
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:03,008
to be in bed with a naked Roland Schitt,

301
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,611
and I am powerless against that.

302
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:08,614
He was naked?

303
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:10,782
He sleeps naked every night.

304
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:17,556
Do you wanna order some thing
to put chocolate sauce on?

305
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,714
No.

306
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:26,565
Um, David, I can swing by the store

307
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:28,767
and help out after school, if you want.

308
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:31,570
I also may need more of
that lip balm that I liked.

309
00:12:31,604 --> 00:12:34,873
Okay. Um, I think we've
had enough of your help.

310
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:37,442
And unless you planning
on purchasing that lip balm

311
00:12:37,477 --> 00:12:39,177
you're won't be getting the lip balm.

312
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:41,747
Okay. It's called sweat equity, David.

313
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:43,415
I learned about this week.

314
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:45,150
And that's when you help someone out

315
00:12:45,184 --> 00:12:46,551
and then they give you lip balm

316
00:12:46,586 --> 00:12:47,953
or whatever else you might need

317
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:50,689
in exchange for your time and energy.

318
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:53,191
I think you might actually
need to break a sweat,

319
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:55,527
in order to earn sweat equity.

320
00:12:55,561 --> 00:12:59,665
Okay, what if I got Patrick
to break a sweat for me.

321
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:02,167
That's called
outsourcing, outsourcing...

322
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:04,336
Are you passing this economics course?

323
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,305
Yes. Yeah.

324
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:07,773
Yes, I'm pretty sure.

325
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:11,009
Okay. Um, if you really
want the lip balm that bad

326
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:12,911
there are a few things around the store

327
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:14,646
that I could use your help with.

328
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:17,482
Just an FYI, Patrick won't be there.

329
00:13:17,517 --> 00:13:19,284
So there won't be anybody for you

330
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:21,219
to flirtatiously boss around.

331
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:23,322
Okay, I hate to break
this to you, David,

332
00:13:23,356 --> 00:13:24,956
but there will always be somebody for me

333
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:26,958
to flirtatiously boss around.

334
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:28,694
So what was going on there?

335
00:13:28,728 --> 00:13:30,595
Oh, nothing.

336
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,997
He hasn't even asked
for my phone number,

337
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,832
which in my experience,

338
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:36,435
means he's either newly
married or he's gay.

339
00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:37,969
Okay...

340
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:40,439
So like if you're sensing
a vibe or something,

341
00:13:40,473 --> 00:13:44,242
maybe that means that his
eye's on somebody else...

342
00:13:46,012 --> 00:13:49,014
He's a business major
who wears straight leg,

343
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:50,916
mid-range denim.

344
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,032
He's not into me.

345
00:13:52,057 --> 00:13:54,485
Okay, well it's either that
or he's really into the store,

346
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,988
which no offense seems
a lot less likely to me.

347
00:13:57,023 --> 00:13:58,757
Okay.

348
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,593
I think you missed a spot on
that page with the highlighter.

349
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:02,994
Where?

350
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:10,502
Hello, Moira.

351
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:13,271
Hello there, love of my life!

352
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:15,974
Funny thing. I just ran into Jocelyn.

353
00:14:17,677 --> 00:14:19,177
Oh. How is Jocelyn?

354
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:22,114
Oh, she was a little upset.

355
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:24,816
Apparently her husband, Roland,

356
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:27,774
spent the night with... you.

357
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:30,822
I know, wasn't that funny?

358
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:32,224
Moira!

359
00:14:32,258 --> 00:14:34,092
When were you gonna tell me about this?

360
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:36,228
Ah, we talked about
it this morning, John!

361
00:14:36,262 --> 00:14:37,729
We laughed about it.

362
00:14:37,764 --> 00:14:39,131
We didn't laugh about it.

363
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:41,466
Because we didn't talk about it.

364
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:43,635
I would have remembered if you had said

365
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:45,337
something that funny.

366
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:46,905
It's inconsequential, John

367
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:48,840
Just let it go. I have.

368
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,277
May I ask what you are doing?

369
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:54,613
Oh, I've decided to
cut down on my drinking.

370
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:57,382
Unrelated, I assume?

371
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:58,717
To what?

372
00:14:58,751 --> 00:15:01,219
To you sleeping with Roland last night.

373
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:02,954
Okay. This joke has played itself out.

374
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,389
It was humorous this morning.

375
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:06,858
We didn't talk about it this morning!

376
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:08,527
Obviously.

377
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:11,897
I didn't tell you anything
because I was embarrassed.

378
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:13,598
I was riding high, John,

379
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:15,300
apparently really high,

380
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:18,336
After winning what some people
called a landmark victory

381
00:15:18,371 --> 00:15:20,505
for this and many other towns.

382
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,609
Then I woke up in the last
place I'd ever wanted to be.

383
00:15:28,214 --> 00:15:32,884
Well, can't say I'm not
glad to hear you say that.

384
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:36,660
Oh John, I owe an apology to you.

385
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,291
And to sober people everywhere.

386
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:43,929
Well, I knew it was nothing
happened, Moira, it's...

387
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:45,363
Just I was getting a feeling

388
00:15:45,398 --> 00:15:47,933
you weren't taking this very seriously.

389
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,836
If I weren't, John, would
I be pouring this out.

390
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:53,638
Moira, that's my beer!

391
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:55,040
You don't even drink beer!

392
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:56,708
It's symbolic, John.

393
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:08,086
Oh-oh.

394
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,488
I take it you're here to tell me

395
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:11,556
that my business
license has been revoked.

396
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:13,258
No, no. You're all good.

397
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:15,126
Okay. Um...

398
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:17,329
My sister isn't,

399
00:16:17,363 --> 00:16:19,468
isn't here so...

400
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:21,900
I'm not here for your sister.

401
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:24,341
Okay.

402
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:26,404
You know I've been
thinking about all this

403
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:29,207
and these products that
Alexis was showing me yesterday

404
00:16:29,242 --> 00:16:31,543
were actually really impressive,

405
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:34,346
I mean the whole model is
actually very sustainable...

406
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,747
Thank you.

407
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:38,517
But I think you're gonna
need more start-up money.

408
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:40,485
Oh. More start-up money.

409
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,220
- Hm.
- Um...

410
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:44,956
And where do you think
I'll get that money?

411
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:46,925
Well, when you're
supporting local business,

412
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,894
there are grants that you can apply for.

413
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:52,097
And I would be happy to assist
you with those applications.

414
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:56,167
Well, that is very um... very generous.

415
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:58,436
Well, I wouldn't be doing it for free.

416
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:01,273
See, if these grants came through,

417
00:17:01,307 --> 00:17:02,741
you'd have the money to start paying me.

418
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,577
Okay. Um...

419
00:17:05,611 --> 00:17:07,913
I really think you have
something here, David.

420
00:17:07,947 --> 00:17:11,304
You just, you just need some
help. You need a lot of help...

421
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,364
Okay. Um...

422
00:17:13,953 --> 00:17:16,452
Well, uh, then yes...

423
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:19,464
I am open to entertaining

424
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:22,800
your investment offer.

425
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:24,296
Great.

426
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:28,833
And in the interest of us
potentially working together

427
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:32,170
I did want to come
clean about something.

428
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:35,106
Okay.

429
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:38,321
I um...

430
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:42,280
I actually picked out that frame.

431
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,284
I see.

432
00:17:48,054 --> 00:17:50,121
So thank you for making it very clear

433
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:52,424
that I will be making
the creative decisions

434
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,601
for the store.

435
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:57,429
Um, and I guess you can
handle all the business stuff.

436
00:17:57,463 --> 00:17:59,264
I'm very comfortable with that.

437
00:17:59,298 --> 00:18:00,665
Okay.

438
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:03,802
Um, and you do know
that if the grant money

439
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:05,403
doesn't come through, then I won't...

440
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:07,539
Oh, I'm gonna get the money.

441
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:10,675
Okay.

442
00:18:19,785 --> 00:18:22,587
- Hello, Johnny.
- Roland.

443
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:25,557
Johnny, me and six of my closest friends

444
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:28,693
were hoping we could have a little chat.

445
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:30,528
Well, it's awfully late.

446
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:32,130
Johnny, I'm talking about the beer.

447
00:18:32,164 --> 00:18:34,199
No, I know, I know, you're
talking about the beer.

448
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:36,067
It's just that Moira's in the shower.

449
00:18:36,102 --> 00:18:39,004
She's been showering
most of the day, actually.

450
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:40,805
Good,

451
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,942
because I think it's best
that we talk man-to-man.

452
00:18:43,976 --> 00:18:45,744
Ahh...

453
00:18:48,648 --> 00:18:50,682
Jocelyn and I spoke,

454
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:53,918
and she told me you're
still pretty upset, huh?

455
00:18:53,953 --> 00:18:56,354
Look, if anyone was
upset it was Jocelyn.

456
00:18:56,389 --> 00:18:59,024
I was just upset because
Jocelyn was upset.

457
00:18:59,058 --> 00:18:59,928
All right, pal.

458
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:02,527
Well, I'm here to put
your mind at ease, okay?

459
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:08,421
I am 99.999% sure

460
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:10,468
that nothing happened
between me and your wife.

461
00:19:10,503 --> 00:19:13,071
I'm 100% sure and I wasn't even there!

462
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:15,073
Well, I sure was.

463
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:18,143
All of me.

464
00:19:18,177 --> 00:19:21,846
You know, I spent 35
minutes this morning

465
00:19:21,881 --> 00:19:26,051
inspecting every inch of
my body for bite marks,

466
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:28,153
back scratches, lipstick prints.

467
00:19:28,187 --> 00:19:29,888
And I couldn't find anything.

468
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:31,690
Well, there was this one
thing on the bottom of my foot,

469
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:33,558
but I think that may
have been there before.

470
00:19:33,592 --> 00:19:34,390
I really don't know.

471
00:19:34,415 --> 00:19:36,140
You know what, Roland,

472
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:36,968
I think I'm gonna ask you to leave.

473
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:39,197
Because Moira's coming out
soon and I really don't...

474
00:19:39,231 --> 00:19:40,732
... Want to tempt fate twice.

475
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:42,133
I got it.

476
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:44,202
No, no. I don't think you do got it.

477
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:47,372
And not to put too fine
a point on it, Roland,

478
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:49,574
but my wife would never
go out for a burger

479
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:52,777
when she has a strong
penchant for steak.

480
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:55,280
- Good night, Roland.
- Breakfast tomorrow, right?

481
00:19:55,314 --> 00:19:56,639
- Good night, Roland.
- Okay.

482
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:02,882
Don't worry it's only me.

483
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,818
Ha ha, very droll, Mr. Rose.

484
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:07,386
Thought I'd announce myself

485
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:09,922
just in case you were
expecting somebody else.

486
00:20:09,957 --> 00:20:12,458
Is living with that blackout
not punishment enough?

487
00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:14,727
You know I meant to ask, Moira,

488
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:17,330
what were the amenities
like in that hotel room?

489
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:19,999
High-pressured water, down pillows?

490
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,435
I'll never know.

491
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:25,138
I had my one chance
at a proletarian oasis

492
00:20:25,172 --> 00:20:28,174
and I squandered it,
passed out in Roland's bed.

493
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,077
You slept with Roland?

494
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:33,846
No, she-she didn't.

495
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:36,582
She found herself in his bed.

496
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:40,253
- Mom slept with Roland?
- Yes. Apparently.

497
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:42,655
I will not be tried and condemned

498
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:44,190
by the likes of you two.

499
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:45,892
- So what's gonna happen now?
- Yeah.

500
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:48,060
Is there gonna be like
a custody battle over us?

501
00:20:48,095 --> 00:20:49,462
David, stop.

502
00:20:49,496 --> 00:20:50,863
We gonna have to like spend weekends

503
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:52,598
over at Roland's now, or?

504
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:54,333
Goodnight, Alexis.

505
00:20:54,368 --> 00:20:56,035
Do we call him Uncle Roland?

506
00:20:56,069 --> 00:20:57,403
All right, that is enough, David.

507
00:20:57,437 --> 00:20:59,205
No. I mean, I get it,
Roland is the mayor,

508
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:00,606
and it's very difficult
to work with someone

509
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:02,008
who you're attracted to.

510
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:03,388
Yeah. Like you and Ted?

511
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:05,474
No! I'm making fun of Mom
and Dad right now, David.

512
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,346
And we're done. Back to your room.

513
00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:10,483
Um, I just want you to know

514
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:11,884
that no matter what anyone says,

515
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,253
you will always be our first dad.

516
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:15,621
- Good night.
- Okay.

517
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,664

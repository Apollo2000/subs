1
00:00:01,156 --> 00:00:03,968
Family! I have exciting news!

2
00:00:05,837 --> 00:00:07,971
Oh Good. David, I hoped you were home.

3
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:09,163
Thanks.

4
00:00:09,197 --> 00:00:10,898
You're aware of the extraordinary work

5
00:00:10,932 --> 00:00:13,952
of New York-Based
photographer Sebastien Raine?

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,271
You mean my ex?

7
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:19,239
When did you date Sebastien Raine?

8
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:21,388
They dated for like a month and a half

9
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:23,210
and David got very upset about it.

10
00:00:23,244 --> 00:00:25,490
Okay, It was almost three months.

11
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:26,915
Four, if you include the month

12
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:28,350
that he was seeing other people.

13
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:30,285
And you met him through me.

14
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:31,398
That's nonsense.

15
00:00:31,423 --> 00:00:34,289
I met Sebastien Raine at
an art opening years ago.

16
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:35,724
At my gallery.

17
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:37,136
And can you please stop
saying his full name.

18
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,545
He's a monster, who uses people,

19
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,029
- and leaves them for dead.
- Yeah.

20
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:43,331
I hate to play contrarian,
David, but The Times and I,

21
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:46,116
both consider Sebastien
Raine a dear friend.

22
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:47,736
Remember when he dumped you?

23
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,171
And you ate all those mall pretzels,

24
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:50,739
and watched "Bridget Jones's Diary"

25
00:00:50,773 --> 00:00:52,440
every day for a year.

26
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:54,576
It wasn't a whole year,

27
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,843
And I will not feel shame
about the mall pretzels.

28
00:00:58,731 --> 00:01:00,465
Okay, that's enough news for today.

29
00:01:01,524 --> 00:01:03,558
Ummm no, what about him?

30
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:06,749
He's coming here.

31
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,558
What? Wha... Why?

32
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:12,694
Sebastien Raine wants to
collaborate on a project.

33
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:14,129
With me.

34
00:01:14,163 --> 00:01:15,730
And you his commitment to his work.

35
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:17,142
He's willing to come all the way here.

36
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,421
When flying me to New
York would be a lot easier.

37
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:20,969
And a welcome escape.

38
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,938
But Sebastien Raine
puts his subjects first.

39
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:25,073
And he told me I must respect that.

40
00:01:25,107 --> 00:01:27,008
Okay. You know what? I don't care.

41
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:28,577
So you can do whatever you like.

42
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:29,624
I could cancel,

43
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:31,140
but you just told me you don't care

44
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:33,327
so now I have no choice but to meet him.

45
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:39,321

46
00:01:43,192 --> 00:01:44,616
I think he's coming.

47
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:46,686
So could you please go to
the window and check for me?

48
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:49,531
- Who's he?
- Uh, Sebastien Raine.

49
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:51,998
He's most likely wearing
a very expensive sweater,

50
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:53,435
that doesn't look very expensive.

51
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:54,870
Is he like, really...

52
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:56,915
Really handsome in a
homeless-y way sort of way? Yes.

53
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,340
Yup. Then he is coming here.

54
00:01:58,374 --> 00:01:59,708
Oh, he is? Okay.

55
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:00,741
- He's walking.
- He's walking.

56
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:02,534
- He's walking towards here.
- Where is he walking to?

57
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:03,874
- And now he's coming in
- Now he's coming in...

58
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,046
and so he's here.

59
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:06,438
He's here. All right.

60
00:02:06,463 --> 00:02:07,335
David.

61
00:02:07,383 --> 00:02:08,783
- Oh...
- Wow.

62
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:09,817
This is...

63
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:12,990
exactly how I pictured it.

64
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:14,070
Sebastien.

65
00:02:14,095 --> 00:02:16,827
Ah... You're-you're here.

66
00:02:17,624 --> 00:02:19,498
I thought you were supposed
to be with my mother.

67
00:02:19,523 --> 00:02:21,327
So good to see you.

68
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:23,460
Look at you... You look really...

69
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:25,724
Healthy.

70
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,364
Thanks.

71
00:02:29,653 --> 00:02:31,621
I can't believe this is where you live.

72
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:35,905
I think you're brave.

73
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,015
Hi.

74
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,808
Stevie.

75
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:40,342
I like your sweater.

76
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:42,460
You must be David's girlfriend.

77
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:45,981
- No...
- No, I own The Motel,

78
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:48,551
so that makes me more
like your landlord?

79
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,919
No. It doesn't.

80
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:51,320
Stevie, Stevie. Stevie.

81
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:53,523
I'd love to Polaroid you naked one day.

82
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,558
Okay.

83
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,326
Okay?!

84
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,105
David, I'm thinking
maybe I'll stay the night,

85
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:02,431
so I hope we can, you know... catch up.

86
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:06,820
Yeah, I'm super busy these days...

87
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:10,506
Yeah, I just feel like we have
unfinished business, you and I.

88
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,907
Room five is available.

89
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,507
Room five sounds great.

90
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,687
So brave.

91
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:21,750
Hm-hm.

92
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,452
- So brave.
- Okay.

93
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,679
Moira!

94
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,267
Sebastien Raine!

95
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,421
- Hello!
- Ohhh!

96
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,709
Is this place not funny?

97
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:49,765
I think it might just be one
of my favorite local dives.

98
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:53,148
I love it. It's just so unassertive.

99
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:55,499
You can't find this in New York City.

100
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:57,887
New York misses you, Moira.

101
00:03:57,912 --> 00:03:59,946
You're too kind.

102
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:04,077
And correct.

103
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:06,428
Tell me things, Sebastien.

104
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:08,430
Tell me everything!

105
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:10,766
Well, I just got back from London.

106
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,668
I was touring with Madonna.

107
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:15,640
She commissioned a
series of anti-portraits.

108
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,226
Whoa.

109
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,074
Well, it sounds brilliant.

110
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:22,511
I want to do something even
more brilliant with you, Moira.

111
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:23,913
Hm.

112
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:27,750
Come, let's walk.
Creativity lives on its feet.

113
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:29,551
Anything else is bullshit.

114
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:31,487
I just ordered you a Sanka-ccino.

115
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:35,391
It's a beautiful day.

116
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:37,493
And you're a beautiful subject.

117
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,629
Sebastian, I must insist
you stop with the flattery...

118
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:42,364
In due time.

119
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:50,509
So I have a quick little
school form you to fill out.

120
00:04:50,534 --> 00:04:51,706
Sure.

121
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:53,519
What is this?

122
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,321
Um nothing. It just
says that I work here.

123
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:58,541
Uh-huh. This is for volunteer hours.

124
00:04:58,566 --> 00:04:59,815
But you don't volunteer here.

125
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:00,948
You work here.

126
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:03,218
But, I volunteer to work here.

127
00:05:03,558 --> 00:05:05,220
Because it's your job.

128
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:07,825
Okay but, I need these
hours to graduate so...

129
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,925
So looks like you're gonna have to find

130
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,327
somewhere to volunteer.

131
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:12,872
Okay. It's just, I thought
my community service hours

132
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,263
would apply but they don't count

133
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:16,231
because their court-ordered. So...

134
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:18,767
Yeah, I think the whole
point of volunteering

135
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:21,070
is to give something back, right?

136
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:22,805
Okay. Sure. But whatever I give back

137
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:25,107
has to happen within two weeks.

138
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:28,293
Well, I might have something for you

139
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:30,840
but... I don't think you're
going to be interested.

140
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:32,047
Try me.

141
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,450
Well, I work with some
seniors a couple times a month.

142
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:36,918
Wow. So cute.

143
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:39,916
Um, it's just I have a thing
with skin tags and old smells.

144
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:41,490
So I might just need to think on it.

145
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:44,026
Well, tonight's gonna be
fun though, dance lessons!

146
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,795
We'd have to touch them.

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,533
Oh psst! Hey, Johnny!

148
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:52,935
Come here! Come here! Come here!

149
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:56,472
- Hey Roland.
- Here sit down. Sit. Sit!

150
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:58,941
Okay. Now act like you're talking to me.

151
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,275
I am talking to you.

152
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,311
No. Not like that.

153
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:03,746
It's got to be more conversational.

154
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,114
You know, like, um...

155
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:08,207
"Yes the weather is cold."

156
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:09,852
Okay, I'm not following.

157
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:11,286
Okay, that's better.

158
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:13,649
- But try it a little more casually.
- What is going on?

159
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,634
Bob is trying to get his
poker night together again

160
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:16,992
and he wants me to play.

161
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:18,274
And I can't afford it.

162
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,996
Well then just say no, politely decline.

163
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:22,998
Well that's not gonna work, Johnny.

164
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:26,499
Tell him that we're doing
something together tonight, okay?

165
00:06:26,524 --> 00:06:29,638
Tell him... you're taking
me for a haircut tonight.

166
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:31,073
- Haircut?
- Hey Johnny.

167
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:33,414
- Roland.
- Oh, Bob.

168
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,321
- Almost didn't see you there.
- Right.

169
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:37,179
I was just Chattin' away with Johnny.

170
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:38,914
Well, I just wanted to let you know that

171
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:41,283
we're starting the
big poker night again,

172
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,555
so if you're interested...

173
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:45,287
Uh well...

174
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,989
I wouldn't mind playing, Bob.

175
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:48,657
- Really?
- Well..

176
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:50,626
That's great!

177
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,696
Well, listen I'll see
you both at my place,

178
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:57,022
uh... around seven.

179
00:06:58,201 --> 00:06:59,725
Seven o'clock.

180
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:01,264
Can I ask you something?

181
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:02,848
Um, do you have even
the slightest concept

182
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:04,540
of what just happened here?

183
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:11,001
- Oh! It is so nice to get away.
- Hm.

184
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:13,215
There's something very cathartic

185
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:14,917
about stepping into
someone else's world.

186
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:16,285
Hm.

187
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,094
That's one of the reasons
we chose to settle here.

188
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:22,157
- David seems well.
- Well he...

189
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,559
Excuse me?

190
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:26,495
I ran into him earlier at the motel.

191
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,129
At the motel?

192
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:30,165
And here I thought I gave you

193
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,236
very specific instructions
to go directly to the cafe.

194
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,671
Ever the renegade.

195
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,973
Yeah, I got here and
decided it was probably best

196
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:39,408
to get a room.

197
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:41,426
Only a day just didn't seem enough.

198
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:43,378
You got yourself a room?

199
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:44,947
Oh, aren't you lucky!

200
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:46,315
They're usually booked up.

201
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:48,217
You must have used our name.

202
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:50,185
But Sebastien, I was
under the impression

203
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,921
that you were here just for
today for a quick consult...

204
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:54,467
Hey! What are you doing?

205
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:57,441
Sorry, it's the way the
light is catching you.

206
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:58,760
The photo took itself.

207
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,456
Ah, but you had to push the button.

208
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,030
Sebastien don't, please.

209
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,800
This is my talk now, shoot later look.

210
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:08,284
So,  this visage is off-limits
for-for the moment.

211
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:09,438
Plea...

212
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:11,507
Don't worry, I'm just
using you for scale.

213
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,041
It's this backdrop.

214
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,145
There's a provincial
romanticism to all this,

215
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:17,333
that's just...

216
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,467
terrifying and important.

217
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:23,852
Far be it from me to stand in the way

218
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:25,420
of your inspiration.

219
00:08:25,455 --> 00:08:28,891
Well, why don't you
actually stand over there?

220
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,292
Where?

221
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:31,793
- Further into the field.
- Oh...

222
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:33,013
Yes!

223
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:37,232
No, into the field.

224
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,667
- Further!
- Huh?

225
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:40,068
- Yeah, into the field.
- Umm?

226
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:41,865
Yes. Further!

227
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:44,273
Sebastien, I was...

228
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:46,711
Let the field reveal itself to you.

229
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,955
Okay... I was wondering

230
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,203
when we do the actual shoot... um...

231
00:08:54,228 --> 00:08:57,030
Are we thinking studio or on location?

232
00:08:57,055 --> 00:08:59,154
Because I bet Mr. Schnabel

233
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:01,290
would love to loan us the Palazzo...

234
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:02,758
Yes!

235
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,860
Okay. As long as you can still hear me.

236
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:06,995
I was also thinking Berlin...

237
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,703
Oh hi!

238
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:19,875
Nice day with Sebastien?

239
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:21,476
Very productive.

240
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:22,844
I think we've laid the groundwork

241
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,131
for an exciting enterprise.

242
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:28,483
I'm sure you'll be a wonderful subject.

243
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:30,219
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

244
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:33,155
Today was more about discussing theme,

245
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:36,158
- and tone, mise en scene.
- Uh-huh.

246
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:40,095
You know, he may have taken
a few reference photos, but...

247
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:42,407
So he photographed you today then?

248
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:47,094
Hm-hm. You know just a few
dozens snaps about town...

249
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,786
picturettes, really.

250
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:52,440
Why would you have
allowed this to happen?

251
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,977
I don't know he just started shooting

252
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,412
and shouting and I did
what he told me to do

253
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:59,714
and I "leaned in" to the moment.

254
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,883
How did that work out for you?

255
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:04,786
I leaned in! I don't know, David.

256
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:07,181
Why don't you try it... sometime!

257
00:10:17,111 --> 00:10:18,875
Everybody, I'd like to introduce Alexis,

258
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,278
she's going to be joining us tonight.

259
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:21,679
So that way we'll all have partners.

260
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:23,070
That's great!

261
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:24,939
Dot, you won't need the Swiffer.

262
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:27,118
I guess I'll be dancing with Ted.

263
00:10:27,673 --> 00:10:29,910
I thought Carol assigns
the dance partners.

264
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:32,913
We'll all get a chance
to dance with Ted.

265
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:34,848
Everyone up!

266
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,001
Come on.

267
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,327
This is actually very cute.

268
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:41,689
Although I did think that
there would be more of them.

269
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:45,092
Yeah, well there used
to be, but... you know.

270
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:47,394
Oh, okay,

271
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:49,997
but these ones actually
smell like very clean,

272
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:51,398
like baby powder.

273
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:52,810
Yeah, I think it's probably better

274
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:54,274
if you call the girls by their names.

275
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:57,037
Ted, could you give me a
hand with these chairs here?

276
00:10:57,072 --> 00:10:58,415
Of course!

277
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:02,086
We've heard a lot about you.

278
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:04,278
That is so sweet.

279
00:11:04,312 --> 00:11:06,111
Why would he bring her here?

280
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:07,881
Are you talking about me?

281
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,684
You can be my dance partner, dear.

282
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:14,549
Dot.

283
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,929
Does Dot have arthritis?

284
00:11:21,963 --> 00:11:24,798
Because it looks like
she's giving me the finger.

285
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,001
Well, she has arthritis,

286
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:30,709
but not in that hand.

287
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:36,486
Full house. Read 'em and weep.

288
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:38,445
And I think I come in second

289
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,080
because I got a pair of Queens.

290
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:42,149
There's no second place, Roland.

291
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:45,219
Well, you were right about
Bob. He's quite the player.

292
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:49,230
I'll go see if Gwen's
has any more of these

293
00:11:49,257 --> 00:11:51,125
bacon-wrapped scallops.

294
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:55,896
Yeah, I guess it's another
trip to Bob's laundromat, right?

295
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,775
You know, because he keeps
taking us to the cleaners.

296
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,199
Yeah, we get it, Roland.

297
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:00,667
I don't think it's an accident

298
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:02,136
that Bob keeps winning.

299
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,504
What are you talking about?

300
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:06,206
Haven't you noticed how
Gwen circles the table

301
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:09,078
with appetizers, constantly eying Bob.

302
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,345
Then he lays down a
big fat bet and wins.

303
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:12,746
You know, come to think of it,

304
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:15,449
those matching visors
they're a little suspicious

305
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:16,850
I don't want to believe this,

306
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:19,953
But ah, I do miss my wristwatch.

307
00:12:20,346 --> 00:12:22,574
I just think it'd be
interesting to see what happens

308
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:25,601
if Gwen wasn't around for the next hand.

309
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:30,674
Ahhh. Like if she had an
"accident" or something?

310
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:34,401
I don't mean bump her off, Roland.

311
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:35,869
I mean, if she's not here,

312
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:37,504
if she had to go to the store.

313
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,339
I want to see how Bob's luck gonna hold

314
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:41,140
if when Gwen's not here.

315
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:43,156
It's worth a shot.

316
00:12:43,469 --> 00:12:45,746
Okay, uh, do you want me to handle this?

317
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,158
I'm pretty good in
high-stakes situations.

318
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:48,816
No. I think, I've got it.

319
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,450
Okay. Well, I'll ride shotgun with you.

320
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,255
So Bob. Were just talking
about how delicious the food is

321
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,191
and you know the only
thing missing is...

322
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:58,799
Gwen's gotta go!

323
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:02,229
I think what Roland is saying is...

324
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:04,698
if she could maybe go to the store

325
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:07,401
to perhaps pick up some a little more...

326
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:08,643
Kosher?

327
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:10,049
And halal.

328
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:12,940
Gwen, you called it!

329
00:13:12,974 --> 00:13:16,020
Yeah. Sure. Sure. That would do it.

330
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,613
Yeah and some gluten-free
options, for the ladies.

331
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:21,148
Oh Gosh,

332
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:22,816
I'm sorry I didn't think of this.

333
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:26,019
But you know, maybe...
maybe Roland could go?

334
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:28,689
He's running pretty low on chips.

335
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:30,191
Sure. I can drive.

336
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:32,426
I don't think you want to drive, Roland.

337
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,943
I don't mind. I love driving.

338
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:36,270
I don't think you do.

339
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:41,275
Yeah, I don't love
driving. Not at night. No!

340
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,870
And I'm drunk.

341
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:43,855
Okay.

342
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,672
I'm all right, dear. I could go.

343
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:47,433
Thanks, sweetheart.

344
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:51,776
Good. All right, so my deal.

345
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:02,178
David.

346
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:05,459
I'm glad you're here. Come in.

347
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,530
Um yeah, I was just getting a drink...

348
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:12,609
by the uh... the
vending machine... so...

349
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:15,536
I had a prolific day
with your mother today.

350
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,904
Yes she said.

351
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:18,305
Very excited about the shoot.

352
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:20,274
The photos are really haunting.

353
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:22,012
Haunting.

354
00:14:22,377 --> 00:14:24,611
Sure she'd be thrilled
about that adjective.

355
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:28,948
Umm, she told me this little... trip

356
00:14:28,973 --> 00:14:31,965
was supposed to be more
of a creative discussion.

357
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,551
David, your Mother is a revelation.

358
00:14:35,723 --> 00:14:39,404
This is the way she was meant
to be presented to the world.

359
00:14:40,094 --> 00:14:41,461
I'm sorry.

360
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:45,175
Is this you deciding what
someone else wants again?

361
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,646
I-I want you to know that I care

362
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,208
about what happened between you and me.

363
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,610
And while my therapist said
I should never feel sorrow,

364
00:14:56,644 --> 00:14:59,165
I do appreciate your pain.

365
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:01,442
Okay.

366
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:03,196
And I wanna explore that.

367
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:04,509
Uh-huh.

368
00:15:04,534 --> 00:15:05,968
Maybe... even...

369
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:08,734
physically.

370
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,915
Oh...

371
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:12,954
Well, I shouldn't.

372
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:14,410
Oh you should.

373
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:18,865
Okay, fine, but um, I can't stay.

374
00:15:23,962 --> 00:15:26,260
Um, okay...

375
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:28,406
Joan, I'm probably wrong,

376
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:30,831
but I feel like the
other ladies are very...

377
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:33,513
un-soothed by the fact that I'm here.

378
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:36,316
Oh they are, but don't worry.

379
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:39,572
It's just that we've just
all grown very fond Of Ted.

380
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,237
Oh well... we're not dating.

381
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:46,226
But I do understand that old women

382
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:50,019
can get very possessive
about young... younger...

383
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:54,968
Dear, we know all about
the failed engagements.

384
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:56,370
But don't worry,

385
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:58,505
I'm not going to rake you
over the coals to find out

386
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:03,191
how on earth you ever let
that one get away. Or why?

387
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:05,746
Okay...

388
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,714
It's none of my business

389
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:10,150
and I'm sure you have your reasons.

390
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:12,653
I'd just want to know what they are?

391
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,921
Aggressive move, Joan.

392
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:17,201
Well, I've been trying to set
Ted up with my granddaughter

393
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:19,775
For two years now. And nothing.

394
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:21,828
Do you want me to put in a good word?

395
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,332
It wouldn't matter. And you know why?

396
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:26,933
Is she not cute?

397
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:29,007
She's not you.

398
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:34,014
You must know that Ted
is still stuck on you.

399
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:38,011
I think you ladies are
just a little bit confused.

400
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:40,881
Ted and I are just very close friends.

401
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:42,349
Hm.

402
00:16:42,383 --> 00:16:47,597
My husband and I were really
close friends for 52 years.

403
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:53,816
Mind if I cut in?

404
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:55,595
Oh, yeah.

405
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,298
But I'm also happy to keep
dancing with one of them.

406
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,600
No, I meant I could dance with Joan.

407
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:02,102
Just the ladies get pretty upset

408
00:17:02,136 --> 00:17:03,770
if I don't divide my time between them.

409
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,305
Oh, yeah. Yeah...

410
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,069
Uh... Well then I will dance with Dot!

411
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,329
I would rather dance with the Swiffer.

412
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,233
Okay...

413
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:25,726
Oh, I can't believe I took
that with three sevens.

414
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:29,228
Well, I guess it wasn't
Gwen, was it, Johnny?

415
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,384
Sorry?

416
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:37,571
Nothing, nothing, Bob.

417
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:41,475
Well, uh, Johnny had this theory

418
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:44,908
that Gwen and you were...

419
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:48,285
Johnny, why don't you
tell Bob your theory.

420
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:53,453
Well, Uh...

421
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:54,855
You thought we were cheating?

422
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:57,038
No! No... I

423
00:17:57,671 --> 00:18:01,461
No offense, but I don't need
to cheat to beat any of you.

424
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:04,264
It's just, you win a lot, Bob.

425
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:05,717
And there's a reason for that.

426
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:09,659
Listen now Ronnie, when you
- when you have a good hand,

427
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:11,919
you close your cards real quick.

428
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,908
And Ray, when you've got a bad hand,

429
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:16,843
you start tapping your foot.

430
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:21,632
And Johnny your right
eyebrow kind of just pops up

431
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,117
And Roland... well, you know...

432
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:26,486
I don't even know if you know the rules.

433
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:28,355
I don't know all of them. No.

434
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:29,756
Well you know, truth is

435
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,492
we put most of the
winnings towards the snacks

436
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:34,661
that Gwen serves up.

437
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:38,027
We thought it was kind of a
special evening for everyone.

438
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:45,138
In my defense, I didn't
believed any of this, Bob.

439
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:46,840
Gwen is very trustworthy.

440
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:48,875
- Ray, you're tapping your foot.
- Okay.

441
00:18:59,523 --> 00:19:01,891
- Moira
- Good morning, Sebastien.

442
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:04,958
I was up all night
evaluating our little project

443
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:07,060
and I've come to the
unfortunate conclusion

444
00:19:07,094 --> 00:19:10,730
that you may have
misrepresented your intentions.

445
00:19:10,912 --> 00:19:13,540
I wanted to capture the real Moira Rose.

446
00:19:13,947 --> 00:19:16,203
Does the real Moira
Rose live in a studio?

447
00:19:16,237 --> 00:19:17,604
Or the Palazzo?

448
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:19,573
I have. And I will again.

449
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:22,108
If you're planning to
capitalize on those images...

450
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:24,044
You just have to trust me.

451
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:25,912
With this work you will, once again,

452
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:29,082
sit atop the summit of
cultural conversation,

453
00:19:29,116 --> 00:19:31,174
with your inspired unfettering.

454
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,378
Oh, I'd love to believe you,

455
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:36,056
but there's a big fat line
between charm and bullshit.

456
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,925
Give me your camera.

457
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,401
David?!

458
00:19:40,862 --> 00:19:44,664
Umm, yes Sebastien
and I just had some um,

459
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:47,534
stuff that we needed to talk about.

460
00:19:47,568 --> 00:19:49,503
Well, I'm having a hard time landing

461
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:51,671
on surprise or betrayal.

462
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:54,795
Yeah, I should probably go. So...

463
00:19:57,111 --> 00:19:59,112
Give me the memory card, Sebastien.

464
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:02,182
Moira, I'm scared for us.

465
00:20:03,217 --> 00:20:04,951
Oh, you mean this memory card?

466
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:08,321
Yeah, I'd give it back,

467
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:11,014
but I don't think it'll
be of much use to you.

468
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:13,153
It accidentally fell out of your camera

469
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,928
into my hand last night.

470
00:20:14,962 --> 00:20:18,046
And then fell out of
my hand into my drink.

471
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:22,135
And then I stepped on it a lot. So...

472
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:26,179
It was really good
to see you, Sebastien.

473
00:20:26,204 --> 00:20:28,072
Good luck with the rest of this project.

474
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:34,414
David, I feel terrible that
you had to do that just for me.

475
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:36,349
It wasn't just for you.

476
00:20:36,384 --> 00:20:38,318
Let's just say we both won.

477
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:45,219
Okay folks, we're going to start with
something a little different tonight.

478
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,741
The game is called crazy eights.

479
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:48,776
And the diamond shaped things are wild.

480
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:50,211
Roland, shush.

481
00:20:50,246 --> 00:20:52,714
Well I'm just glad
we're back here again,

482
00:20:52,748 --> 00:20:55,550
and that we could put all
that unpleasantness behind us.

483
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:58,086
Gwen, these Teriyaki
meatballs they're delicious.

484
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,722
Wow and those sliders look incredible.

485
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:02,269
Those aren't for you.

486
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,512
How's that watch working out for you?

487
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:06,605
I love it.

488
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,187
Thanks.

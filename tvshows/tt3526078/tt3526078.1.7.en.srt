1
00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:07,449
(Purposeful footsteps)

2
00:00:09,256 --> 00:00:10,790
(Knocking)

3
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:14,268
Don't judge me for what
I'm about to ask you to do.

4
00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:16,537
Come inside, please.

5
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:18,339
- What're you about to...
- It does not matter. It doesn't matter.

6
00:00:18,373 --> 00:00:20,641
What?

7
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:23,877
That.

8
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:26,080
- That's why you called me in here?
- Yeah, look at it!

9
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:28,047
- I'm looking.
- No! Look at it.

10
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:29,983
Uh, it looks like a bug...

11
00:00:30,017 --> 00:00:32,385
- Yeah.
- Trapped under a glass.

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,454
I Googled that bug. It's
some sort of demonic cricket

13
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:36,756
that "takes chunks out of
your skin when provoked."

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,791
Chunks is the word that Google used.

15
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:40,527
You Googled a bug?

16
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:43,463
Yeah. I have a thing about
bugs with milky exoskeletons.

17
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:44,664
I have this irrational fear they
are gonna crawl into my mouth

18
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:47,467
and nest at night, so...

19
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:49,168
So, what do you want me to do, kill it?

20
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:52,104
(Sighs) No, I think I
just need moral support

21
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:55,274
while I slip a piece of paper
under the glass with the bug

22
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:58,010
and take the trapped
bug and walk it outside.

23
00:00:58,044 --> 00:01:00,078
Or we could just... kill it.

24
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:03,149
No, that's not the way to go.
Oh! Oh my God! It's fleeing!

25
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:04,850
- Whoa, it's fast!
- It's fleeing into the bathroom.

26
00:01:04,884 --> 00:01:06,118
That's why you use the cup method,

27
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:08,053
because you'd keep it contained!

28
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:10,555
Now it's just all out!

29
00:01:10,589 --> 00:01:12,349
Well... I guess I don't
even need to be here.

30
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:14,192
Well, it's h...

31
00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:15,527
Now it's hiding somewhere in the darkness

32
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:17,262
Waiting for nightfall.

33
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:20,598
I... I can't... I can't sleep
here. I can't sleep here.

34
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,134
Not with your mouth open anyway.

35
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:26,304
<i>That's not a nice thing to say to me.</i>

36
00:01:26,338 --> 00:01:27,973
You know, sometimes I forget what
life was like before I knew you.

37
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:30,607
Okay, bye-bye! Bye. Yup.

38
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:32,777
'Kay. Hope you catch it!

39
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:34,645
(Door shuts heavily)

40
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,947
I can hear it. I can hear it.

41
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:41,719
- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe -

42
00:01:43,955 --> 00:01:46,256
(Shower water turns off, water drains)

43
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,593
(Tapping)

44
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:51,195
<i>What the hell?</i>

45
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,764
<i>Hey! Where's my towel?!</i>

46
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,066
<i>John?</i>

47
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,070
<i>Johnny?! Where's my towel?!</i>

48
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:01,672
Anyways, I asked this kid to
come to the front of the class

49
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:03,940
and solve this math equation

50
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:07,444
and he was "pitching a tent." (Laughing)

51
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:09,379
- He had a boner!
- Oh.

52
00:02:09,414 --> 00:02:13,149
And then I was thinking, these
are young boys, these poor kids,

53
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:16,586
and it can't be easy having
a teacher like myself, so...

54
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,023
- Mm...
- What was your question again?

55
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,157
You know, it's been so
long I can't remember.

56
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:23,492
(Door bursts open)

57
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:26,562
There you are, John! Where did my towel go?

58
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:29,665
Moira! Nanaimo bars.

59
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,335
Accidentally doubled the batch
and Roland's on diabetes watch,

60
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:34,870
so I thought why not share the wealth?

61
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,805
Well, what a lovely gesture, huh, Moira?

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,275
John, I had towel and now it's disappeared!

63
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:41,777
There's a towel on the back of the door.

64
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:43,445
No, that one has dirt on it!

65
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:46,115
That's not dirt. I used it to kill a bug.

66
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:48,652
(Moira screams in anguish)

67
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:53,554
I'm sorry. I... I guess I'm stressed.

68
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,260
Morning, Jocelyn!

69
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:01,763
You know, Moira, you ever
need to just go somewhere

70
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:04,299
to unwind and have some pampering,

71
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,368
I know a great place in Elmdale.

72
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,637
Let's not and say we did.

73
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:11,072
You know, honey, a little
pampering might not be a bad idea.

74
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:15,509
Could alleviate some of that
weight your carrying around.

75
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:18,611
So now I'm fat and stressed?

76
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:21,783
Emotional weight. Emotional.

77
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:24,852
John, go find a towel now, please,

78
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:27,288
or I will strip out of this robe

79
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:31,025
and I will air dry in the street!

80
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:32,793
Okay, well, I'm just gonna go home. Sorry.

81
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:34,728
No, no, no. I didn't
say I didn't want them.

82
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:37,498
Thank you. (Door closes)

83
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:39,866
A little pampering. Great idea.

84
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:42,703
- I think so, yeah.
- Yeah.

85
00:03:42,737 --> 00:03:45,572
(Truck zooms by, "Open" sign squeaks)

86
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:51,444
Hey, Twy. (Sighs)

87
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:53,012
(Twyla takes customer's order)

88
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:55,581
Um, Twy...

89
00:03:55,616 --> 00:03:59,419
What is in the "Meadow Harvest" smoothie?

90
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:01,621
Uh... you know, it changes every day.

91
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,289
Just depends on my mood.

92
00:04:03,324 --> 00:04:05,891
But it's all organic, earthy ingredients.

93
00:04:05,926 --> 00:04:08,361
Okay, so it's like fruity or... ?

94
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:10,662
Yes, it is. Yup. At times.

95
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:13,898
And then other times, not.

96
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,868
Okay! Well, today, is it more
fruity or more vegetably... ?

97
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:18,837
No, I don't know.

98
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:21,340
I've gotta check in the
back and see what we have.

99
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:24,810
So Meadow Harvest doesn't refer
to anything... in particular.

100
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:27,979
No, Meadow Harvest is
exactly how it sounds.

101
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:30,481
It just changes everyday.

102
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:33,617
Mm... okay. All right.
Well, I'll just um...

103
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:36,253
Do that that then...
the Meadow Harvest thing.

104
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:39,657
- Great!
- Thank you.

105
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:41,191
Hi.

106
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:44,595
Hi.

107
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:47,130
Um, I just feel like I have to warn you,

108
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:48,798
what you just ordered is gonna...

109
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,600
Run through you like Niagara Falls.

110
00:04:50,634 --> 00:04:52,502
Excuse me?

111
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:55,538
Uh, she's a sweet girl but
her smoothies are deadly.

112
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:57,741
Um, I usually prescribe them to my patients

113
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:59,676
when they're feeling a little... backed up.

114
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,711
That's a lot of information.

115
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:04,681
I'm... I'm... I'm
kidding. I'm actually not.

116
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:07,751
I've absolutely done
that... With her smoothies.

117
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:09,785
So are you a doctor or... ?

118
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:11,587
I'm a veterinarian.

119
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:14,223
Oh! It's basically the same thing.

120
00:05:14,257 --> 00:05:16,559
- Ted.
- Um... Alexis.

121
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:19,695
I know. Without sounding too forward,

122
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:23,799
I've seen you around and
uh... You know, I have to say,

123
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,367
I think that you are
the most beautiful girl

124
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:27,103
this town's ever seen.

125
00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:29,170
(Feigning humility) What? No.

126
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:32,173
I'm sure there's like
another girl... somewhere.

127
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,909
No, I mean it.

128
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:35,744
Yeah.

129
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:39,014
Well, it's really nice of you to say.

130
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,850
I would love to take you
out to dinner sometime.

131
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:44,219
- Oh!
- I feel good about this one.

132
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:48,956
Yeah, it's a little less fruity
but a little more... something.

133
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:51,659
Mm!

134
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:52,760
Mm...

135
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:57,397
(Giggles and spits)

136
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:01,102
(Mouths) Oh my God.

137
00:06:01,136 --> 00:06:04,705
(Door opens and closes)

138
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,243
So... about the bug thing.

139
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:12,146
No explanation necessary.
You've got a thing about bugs.

140
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,614
No, I don't have a thing about bugs.

141
00:06:13,648 --> 00:06:15,982
It was one bug, and that bug was milky.

142
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:18,519
So... you're a man at one with nature.

143
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:20,086
Yeah. I could not be
more at one with nature.

144
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:22,088
I do Coachella every year, so...

145
00:06:22,123 --> 00:06:24,691
Mm. Oh! So you'd be... Into coming with me

146
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:27,226
on the annual Turkey shoot then.

147
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,963
That's something that should excite you.

148
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:32,165
What?

149
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,600
- The Turkey shoot?
- Mm.

150
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:38,838
Roland's annual thing. We
go out and we hunt turkeys.

151
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:42,275
Been doing it every year since I was
far too young to be holding a gun.

152
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:44,443
Yeah... yes. Yeah. Let's do that.

153
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,148
I was joking.

154
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:52,417
I have a strong feeling
that would not be your thing.

155
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:54,953
And what do think "my thing" is exactly?

156
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:56,555
High thread count sheets?

157
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:57,856
Colognes that smell like fireplace...

158
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:59,491
Okay. Well, it might surprise you to know

159
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:00,793
that I have more than one thing,

160
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:04,396
so I will happily go with you on the hunt!

161
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,699
Nothing would make me
more excited than to...

162
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:09,067
Go hunting for...

163
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:11,502
- Turkeys.
- Turkeys... with you,

164
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:14,572
So... is this a tweed or a camo situation?

165
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,478
Okay, did anyone actually see this pillow

166
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:23,480
come out of this container?

167
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:26,784
Seriously?! Go. To. Hell!

168
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,419
You're off... you're a fool!

169
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:30,221
Okay, Moira, why are we doing this?

170
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:31,655
Why don't we wait for the girl to come in

171
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,756
and help us make the bed?

172
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,092
She never comes, John.

173
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:37,194
(Knock at the door, Johnny sighs)

174
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:41,365
<i>No. Bastard. Bastard!</i>

175
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,166
- Jocelyn! Hi!
- Johnny.

176
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,302
<i>Oh good, you're here, Moira.</i>

177
00:07:45,337 --> 00:07:48,138
I was just booking myself an
appointment with Janine at the salon

178
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:50,840
and I said to myself, "wow,

179
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:53,409
Moira really looks like
she needs a pick-me-up,"

180
00:07:53,444 --> 00:07:55,511
so I booked you a Mani too!

181
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:57,880
Little girls spa day on me.

182
00:07:57,914 --> 00:08:01,217
Wow! What a nice gesture!

183
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:04,019
May I see a spa treatment menu?

184
00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:05,821
Oh, well, it's just a salon,

185
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:07,857
so they don't really do
all that kind of stuff.

186
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:10,259
But she does give a mean scalp massage.

187
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:13,428
Really mean?

188
00:08:13,463 --> 00:08:15,898
If you requested that, I guess, yeah.

189
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:18,000
Moira, this sounds too good to pass up.

190
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:20,035
Please, please do this, for me.

191
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:23,505
Let me rephrase that.

192
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:25,775
Do it for you because you deserve...

193
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:28,109
Yes! My answer's yes, Jocelyn. Thank you.

194
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:29,478
- Yay!
- Oh, yes.

195
00:08:29,512 --> 00:08:30,679
(Birds chirp)

196
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:35,850
So, what're you doing tonight?

197
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:38,052
Making chili. Might do some laundry.

198
00:08:40,723 --> 00:08:42,591
(Awkward silence)

199
00:08:44,594 --> 00:08:46,127
A polite person would now ask me

200
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:48,896
what I'm doing tonight.

201
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,499
That's what this is about? Sorry.

202
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:52,933
Um... what're you doing tonight?

203
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,735
Ted's taking me out.

204
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,306
- Ted.
- Mm-hmm. Ted.

205
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,776
I don't know his last name.
The... the, um, doctor.

206
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,678
- The vet?
- Yeah, the doctor.

207
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:06,680
The animal doctor.

208
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:11,418
Yeah, we went to high school together.

209
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:13,019
I think you'd be good for each other.

210
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,189
Do you?

211
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,557
I think he has everything
you're looking for in a husband.

212
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,294
A husband?

213
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,297
What am I looking for in a husband?

214
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,865
Money.

215
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,036
Hmm.

216
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,941
(Birds chirp, crow caws)

217
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,177
Did you know Richard Gere's
middle name is Tiffany?

218
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,179
So Ted's taking me to Antonio's.

219
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,181
What's Antonio's?

220
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,951
<i>It's this little buffet
restaurant in Elmdale,</i>

221
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,419
but he said that we
could order off the menu.

222
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,821
Are you sure you wanna be
traveling so far out of town

223
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,656
with a person you just met?

224
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,858
I went on a blind date to Bali with Leo,

225
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:57,761
so... I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be fine.

226
00:09:57,795 --> 00:09:59,296
So who is this person?

227
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:01,832
Mm... he's cute.

228
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,168
- And...
- And...

229
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:05,836
He doesn't have a trust fund,

230
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:09,673
so, like, that's a refreshing
change of pace for me.

231
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:12,208
Speaking of people without trust funds,

232
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,965
what about that beardy thing
that you spend time with?

233
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:15,599
- What? Mutt?
- Yeah.

234
00:10:15,634 --> 00:10:17,868
- No. Ew. It's not a thing.
- Right.

235
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:20,304
<i>- I'm looking for Alexis.
- Oh, you have a what?</i>

236
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:22,373
<i>- (Gasps)
- A thing with Alexis tonight?</i>

237
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:24,341
- Uh, a date.
- I think that's Ted.

238
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:26,044
(Gasps) Why is he over there?

239
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:28,979
Because he knows how much I love it when
mom and dad interrogate your boyfriends.

240
00:10:29,113 --> 00:10:30,981
- I wonder what they're asking?
- No, David!

241
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:33,284
Tell me, Ted, are your
parents still together?

242
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:34,485
Uh, no. They divorced
when I was in high school.

243
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,987
Oh... alcoholism.

244
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:39,089
No, I think they just realized that
they were better off as friends.

245
00:10:39,123 --> 00:10:42,058
<i>- Tsk, tsk. Affair. Poor thing.
- Hmm.</i>

246
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:43,860
(Door opens) Okay. That's enough,
everybody. Thank you so much. Hey!

247
00:10:43,895 --> 00:10:45,328
Ted: Hey! Got the wrong room. Hi.

248
00:10:45,362 --> 00:10:47,030
- Yeah, you did. Okay.
- Yeah. Uh...

249
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:50,500
Hey! I know you!

250
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:52,602
Yeah, no, Stevie brought you in to see me.

251
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:54,938
I had the pleasure of treating
your son's panic attack.

252
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:58,407
So Antonio's buffet, huh?

253
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:00,876
- So many choices, one little plate.
- Okay, you know what?

254
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:04,580
Bye, guys. We'll see you in the morning!

255
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:06,882
"In the morning!" Very funny, Alexis!

256
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,818
Don't even think about
it. Ain't gonna happen.

257
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:10,953
- Ted, not on the first date.
- Yes, sir.

258
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:13,856
Don't wanna kill the buzz, but have fun.

259
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,291
Alexis seems to have found
someone to keep her busy.

260
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:18,293
What about you, David?

261
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:21,096
I'm gonna go to bed. I have to be up early

262
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,099
I stupidly agreed to go
hunting with Stevie tomorrow.

263
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:25,334
- Hunting?!
- Yeah.

264
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:26,602
- Hunting?!
- Yeah.

265
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:28,237
You said hunting?!

266
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,005
Yeah.

267
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
(Door closes)

268
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,777
Wow.

269
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:38,880
(Crickets chirp, cell phone alarm rings)

270
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:42,783
(Sighs)

271
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:44,652
- Agh!
- It's me!

272
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:46,787
- Who is it?
- It's your father!

273
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:48,656
What're you doing lurking in our bedroom?

274
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,824
I'm not "lurking" in your
room. Your alarm is going off,

275
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:52,826
you're not turning off your alarm!

276
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:55,329
Shoot!

277
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:56,497
You know, I'm telling you, I... I... I...

278
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:58,532
I'm not comfortable with you going hunting.

279
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,401
I don't feel comfortable with it either!

280
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:03,902
End. This. Now. Thank you.

281
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:07,274
- All right, just be careful please!
- Okay. Thanks.

282
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:09,628
You and your nightgown can
tippy-toe back to bed. I'm late.

283
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,528
(Foliage crunches underfoot)

284
00:12:22,364 --> 00:12:23,364
(Coveralls zip)

285
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:27,502
You ever killed before?

286
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:30,737
Have I ever killed before? No.

287
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:34,108
Elton John used to have an annual
hunt at his place in Windsor,

288
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:35,742
but that was more about the lunch.

289
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:37,677
(Yelling) Turkey virgin!

290
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:44,183
Does this come in a slimmer cut?

291
00:12:44,218 --> 00:12:45,418
Here. You can take this one.

292
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:48,121
It has a scope so you can see the head.

293
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:51,825
Okay! (Clears throat)
Gather round, my shooters.

294
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:54,193
Bob has a little prayer
here he'd like to offer up.

295
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:57,229
Just a little convo with the
big man upstairs for a second.

296
00:12:57,263 --> 00:13:00,165
It happens every year.

297
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,334
Our God, in these times of need,

298
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:06,872
our light in these times of darkness...

299
00:13:06,907 --> 00:13:08,641
- David, do you wanna...
- Oh.

300
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:13,078
(Lid snaps, traffic rumbles nearby)

301
00:13:13,112 --> 00:13:16,313
So is it, like, a small town thing

302
00:13:16,348 --> 00:13:19,884
to end the first date
with a kiss on the cheek?

303
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,152
- (Laughs silently)
- What?

304
00:13:21,186 --> 00:13:23,287
Nothing.

305
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:25,456
What?! It's not like it
was a bad date or anything.

306
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,225
Well, it sounds like things got crazy.

307
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,528
Yeah! I actually introduced him to Beyonce

308
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:33,964
on the car ride on the way
home, so that was very special.

309
00:13:33,998 --> 00:13:36,499
It's just, if the date's a success with me,

310
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:38,936
I'll let you know it.

311
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,503
Okay... (Laughs)

312
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:42,205
(Car rumbles)

313
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:46,109
I mean, he might as well
have shaken your hand.

314
00:13:46,143 --> 00:13:47,578
Well, he did that too.

315
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:49,813
- Hey!
- Hey!

316
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:52,314
I thought that you could
use a proper smoothie!

317
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:55,384
Well, lucky for you,
we're just finishing up.

318
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,819
(Forced kiss)

319
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:04,126
Uh, hey, Mutt. Do you want a ride?

320
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,828
- I'm good.
- Are you sure? It's a long walk.

321
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:07,229
I like walking.

322
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,198
Suit yourself, bud.

323
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:10,899
So you don't mind wrapping up?

324
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:15,670
(Door bangs shut) Bye!

325
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:17,472
(Car rumbles away)

326
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:23,377
So how are your bowels? Good and tight?

327
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:26,047
Yes. Thank you for the concern.

328
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:28,049
Well, I just wanna make sure
you got the stomach for this

329
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:31,719
'cause you, you kinda seem like
an indoors-y sort of guy to me.

330
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:35,756
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, delicate. Fragile. Scrimpy.

331
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,257
Thank you.

332
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:40,861
Okay, get down.

333
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:44,932
(Grunting and sighing)

334
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:49,502
Have you ever held a gun before?

335
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:52,271
Uh, yeah, but it wasn't this... heavy,

336
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:54,473
which makes me think that
Elton's was actually a toy.

337
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:56,308
All right, you gotta...

338
00:14:56,343 --> 00:14:58,778
Treat it like it's a newborn baby.

339
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:00,713
Have to admit, not into babies

340
00:15:00,748 --> 00:15:03,883
so it's kind of a guessing game for me.

341
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,417
Oh, you got soft hands.

342
00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:07,486
Okay, thank you. Thanks.

343
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:08,987
You don't have to do this.

344
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:12,323
Do what? Have fun?

345
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:15,260
Smell like manure? Get called "scrimpy"?

346
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:16,895
Who wouldn't wanna sign up for this?

347
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:18,263
Yeah.

348
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:20,132
(Diner door opens, music plays)

349
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:27,004
Oh, uh, Jocelyn, would you grab us a table

350
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,839
while I speak with my husband, please.

351
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:31,441
Well, he should join us!
And... between you and me,

352
00:15:31,476 --> 00:15:33,177
people are noticing you!

353
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:34,979
(Chuckles politely)

354
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:43,619
Excuse me, cowboy, have
you seen my husband?

355
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:47,023
Oh my God. Oh, oh, oh... (Laughs)

356
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:50,093
Look at you. Boy, you look like...

357
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:51,961
Who? Who do I look like?

358
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:53,663
I wanna say Tanya Harding.

359
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:55,131
Do you? How about... ?

360
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:00,269
- Jocelyn!
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:16:00,304 --> 00:16:04,306
Oh my God, that's right! Why Jocelyn?

362
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,741
Because everyone who
comes out of that salon

363
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:07,943
looks just like Jocelyn.

364
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:12,047
Wow! And is that you? Is that your... wig?

365
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:14,416
No, it's a dead possum.
Yes, it's a wig, John.

366
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,984
Is she still looking at us?

367
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:22,290
Yes, she is. Yes. So what happened?

368
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:24,125
I can't believe you're wearing this.

369
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,293
This is what I get for being nice, John.

370
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:28,429
I'm doing this for Jocelyn
because she paid for it,

371
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:29,831
and it was her "little treat,"

372
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,785
and I didn't have the
heart to rip it off my head

373
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,835
much less torch it.

374
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,002
So, now, until I get in the shower,

375
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,677
I'm stuck looking like every other inmate

376
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,173
in this godforsaken prison.

377
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,475
She's coming over. I just told a joke.

378
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:43,978
You did? (Laughs) You did!

379
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:47,313
What do you think of your beautiful wife?

380
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:49,983
Well, which... beautiful wife
are we talking about here, huh?

381
00:16:50,017 --> 00:16:52,518
Oh... (Laughs)

382
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,555
Well, I can't tell you
how freeing it is, Jocelyn,

383
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:58,792
to... to try something new like this. 'Tis.

384
00:16:58,826 --> 00:17:00,794
I mean, of course, as an actress,

385
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:03,930
I can imagine what kind
of sad character might...

386
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:05,865
<i>But not necessarily.</i>

387
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,300
Sad?! You think this is a sad look?

388
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:09,635
[Both] No! No.

389
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:11,703
Not the look. No, Jocelyn,

390
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:14,106
I'm talking about the inner sadness

391
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:18,077
that would come from...
From living in such a...

392
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:20,312
We have to get drinks. Several drinks,

393
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:22,214
don't you think? Let's celebrate!

394
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,516
Let's... celebrate drinking!
Okay. (Awkward laugh)

395
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,585
(Turkey gobbles) Okay, David,

396
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:30,354
<i>it's all yours. Aim for the face.</i>

397
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:32,023
(Whispering) It's looking at me.

398
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:34,725
That's it. You're locked
in. It's just you and him.

399
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,727
- (Turkey gobbles)
- Okay...

400
00:17:36,762 --> 00:17:38,462
(Sharp inhale)

401
00:17:38,497 --> 00:17:39,664
(Whispering) Just point and shoot, David.

402
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:40,899
Hard to do when you're talking, Bob.

403
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:41,966
There's no one talking now.

404
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:43,301
- Bob, you're talking.
- What?

405
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:44,769
- Stop talking!
- Too much talking!

406
00:17:44,803 --> 00:17:46,637
Shoot the bird, David! Shoot it!

407
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:47,538
Ronnie honestly, if you're
not gonna shoot it, I...

408
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:49,173
(loud blast)

409
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,278
(David gasps, horrified)

410
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,714
- And... in the neck.
- It's still moving.

411
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:59,216
Just let it bleed out.

412
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,118
You okay?

413
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:03,386
I feel like one of the Manson girls.

414
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:05,488
First time's tough.

415
00:18:05,523 --> 00:18:06,956
Even tougher when you shoot it in the neck

416
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,458
'cause then it takes longer to die.

417
00:18:08,492 --> 00:18:10,226
Okay, not helping, Ronnie.

418
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,195
So, now what? Do we just...

419
00:18:12,229 --> 00:18:15,198
Wait until its Turkey family
comes and shoot them too?

420
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:17,734
Hey, I think I see them.

421
00:18:17,768 --> 00:18:18,868
- (Turkeys gobble loudly)
- No, no.

422
00:18:18,902 --> 00:18:20,370
(Rhythmic knock at the door)

423
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:22,305
<i>Yes! Heard you.</i>

424
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:27,976
- Jocelyn! Hi.
- Hi.

425
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,246
I just wanted to say how fun it
was to spend the day with you.

426
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,650
Oh, Jocelyn, 'tis I who
owes you a big thank you.

427
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:38,153
I also wanted to apologize
for Janine ruining your wig.

428
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:39,555
No, don't be silly. I was...

429
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:42,390
I was about to... Find a shower cap.

430
00:18:42,424 --> 00:18:44,692
I know you hate your hair, Moira.

431
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:47,762
Almost as much as you hate this town.

432
00:18:47,796 --> 00:18:49,663
But there's a possibility you could be here

433
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:51,432
a really long time.

434
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:54,268
May I offer you something?

435
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:57,872
The people here are
just trying to help you,

436
00:18:57,906 --> 00:19:01,075
and there'll be days when
your wigs need conditioning...

437
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:04,912
Or one of your fashion-y
blouses shrinks in the dryer,

438
00:19:04,946 --> 00:19:09,083
and you'll have to go to Janine's
or get a shirt at the Blouse Barn,

439
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:11,685
just like the rest of us.

440
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:14,755
And I would hate for that
day to catch you by surprise.

441
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:17,424
I don't hate this town, Jocelyn.

442
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:21,695
It's just not mine,
and this is not my hair.

443
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:23,062
I know. It's a wig.

444
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:25,932
It's not my style.

445
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:28,234
You? On you, it's adorable.

446
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:30,503
You have a look that
says, "Hi. I'm Jocelyn,

447
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,906
and I know who I am!"

448
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,474
For that, you're very fortunate. You are.

449
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,511
I don't who I am from
one moment to the next.

450
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:43,216
So honestly, dear, I envy you, all right?

451
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,951
But if you ever... Ever catch me shopping

452
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,820
at the Blouse Barn,

453
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,989
you must shoot me in the temple.

454
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,324
Promise?

455
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,394
Promise.

456
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,062
My son is hunting right
now with your husband,

457
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,064
so I... I know you people have guns.

458
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:07,103
What about what we just
did, makes you think,

459
00:20:07,137 --> 00:20:09,873
"yeah, you know what? I wanna do
this year after year after year"?

460
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:11,741
Was it the lying in the mud part

461
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:14,310
or was it... Wearing the clothes (Sniffs)

462
00:20:14,344 --> 00:20:17,079
That smell like menthol
cigarettes and body odor?

463
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:19,582
'cause usually it's more fun.

464
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:22,585
Usually Ray comes and... gets wasted and...

465
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,853
Spends the whole day
singing Carole King ballads.

466
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:26,187
(Adjoining door opens) David, I...

467
00:20:26,222 --> 00:20:28,390
Need a towel, please.

468
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:29,791
Is that a new wig? Because...

469
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:31,106
You are reminding me of someone.

470
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:33,094
Towel, please.

471
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:36,331
I need my towels. Uh,
what... who did this to you?!

472
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:37,866
You went to Janine's.

473
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:40,068
Yes. Jocelyn took me to...

474
00:20:40,102 --> 00:20:42,738
(gasps) Jocelyn! You look like Jocelyn!

475
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:46,373
Jocelyn. And what's your excuse?

476
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:49,476
Oh, um... I shot a bird in the neck today.

477
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:52,179
It was an indelible image
that I had scarred in my mind

478
00:20:52,213 --> 00:20:55,215
until I saw what was...
Happening up there with you.

479
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,884
(Stifling laughter) So... thank you.

480
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:01,288
I'm gonna get your towel.

481
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:07,226
(Sighs)

482
00:21:07,228 --> 00:21:11,000

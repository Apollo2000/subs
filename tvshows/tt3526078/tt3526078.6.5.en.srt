1
00:00:02,793 --> 00:00:03,823
As your publicist,

2
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:06,104
it is my job to optimize
a branded approach

3
00:00:06,249 --> 00:00:08,225
to real-time engagement
with your fanbase

4
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:09,836
through contextual marketing.

5
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:12,230
I hope I'm not paying you
by the word.

6
00:00:12,317 --> 00:00:14,145
Which is why I came up
with the ideation

7
00:00:14,232 --> 00:00:15,711
for the following idea.

8
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:19,324
"Crows."

9
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:22,240
"Movie."

10
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,504
"Premiere?!"
They're doing a premiere?

11
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:27,158
I thought it was streaming
on Interflix?

12
00:00:27,245 --> 00:00:29,508
Where are they
thinking? I.? New York?

13
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:31,858
London might be central
for the Bosnian team.

14
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:33,642
No, they're not doing
a premiere.

15
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:36,254
Alexis, your flip-chart says
"premiere."

16
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:38,299
Okay, will you let me finish
what I'm trying say?

17
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:39,443
What're you trying to say?

18
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:41,644
I'm sorry, why are you even
involved in this conversation?

19
00:00:41,732 --> 00:00:44,568
- What is it, Alexis?!
- Oh my God, okay!

20
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:47,178
So I thought because they're
not throwing a premiere,

21
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:49,565
we could plan a premiere
screening here in town.

22
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:51,617
Could be like a cute
press angle.

23
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:54,359
Oh, sure, for a scrappy
little novice,

24
00:00:54,446 --> 00:00:57,449
but not for someone
who's cut many a crimson rug.

25
00:00:57,536 --> 00:00:59,917
What's next, I sign my name
in the pavement

26
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:01,156
outside Bob's Garage?

27
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:04,039
Jocelyn gives you an
honourary degree at her school?

28
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:06,655
Host the Met Ga-la
at David's store?

29
00:01:06,743 --> 00:01:07,797
I don't like that one.

30
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:10,808
No, I have like big plans
for an immersive experience.

31
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:12,787
Ronnie said that she can find
a red carpet,

32
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,728
and Roland has a guy
who rents out live crows.

33
00:01:16,793 --> 00:01:19,079
I think we should take
the lead from Interflix.

34
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:22,481
I cannot stop the masses from
gathering to view the film,

35
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:25,960
but best... best to avoid
any fulsome indecorum

36
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:28,567
until we're assured
a positive reaction.

37
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:30,743
Remember that "Waterworld II"
premiere?

38
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,279
Exactly, David. Oh, the last
place anyone wanted to be

39
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:35,622
when those reviews came in

40
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,364
was a glass-bottomed pirate ship

41
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:40,346
in the middle of the ocean.
Mm.

42
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,799
- Good luck though.
- Lick rust! Thank you!

43
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,663

45
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,488
Can't thank you enough
for driving today, Stevie.

46
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:56,513
I don't know what is going on
with my car.

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,826
I do. It's a death trap that
needs to be set on fire

48
00:01:58,914 --> 00:01:59,844
and pushed off a cliff.

49
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:01,981
Well, I'd love to say I had
a choice in the matter,

50
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:03,477
but according to David,

51
00:02:03,564 --> 00:02:05,827
driving his fiancé to go
get his wisdom teeth out

52
00:02:05,914 --> 00:02:08,482
is totally within my maid-of
honour responsibilities.

53
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,527
Okay, tell me
how I'm being unreasonable?

54
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:12,312
Also, if this is what it takes

55
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,270
to get you out of that dank
little apartment...

56
00:02:14,357 --> 00:02:16,925
Excuse me, I have a business
meeting this afternoon.

57
00:02:18,926 --> 00:02:20,898
Just gonna leave it at that?

58
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,875
Mr. Rose asked if he could
come over to my place.

59
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,578
I think he's gonna push for me
to come back,

60
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:29,502
and I don't know
if I can say no.

61
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,511
And that's a bad thing?

62
00:02:31,654 --> 00:02:33,395
I'm supposed to be looking
for other jobs.

63
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,046
Okay. Honestly, Stevie,

64
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:37,779
what other job is better
than owning your own business?

65
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,434
I guess I just feel like after
making such a big deal out of...

66
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:42,405
wanting to see what else
is out there,

67
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:44,081
isn't it kind of... pathetic

68
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:47,418
to like... crawl back?

69
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:49,188
Don't answer that.

70
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:51,603
I already turned down another
job interview today.

71
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,289
Maybe you just needed to see
what you didn't want

72
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:55,955
in order to figure out
what you do?

73
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,651
Look at me. Two years ago,

74
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:59,786
I thought I'd have a wife
and kid at this point.

75
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:02,887
Yeah, well,
one out of two isn't bad.

76
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:04,886
I've been told I'm...
very young at heart.

77
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:08,306
Can you drive better,
please?

78
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:15,375
- Hi.
- Uh-oh!

79
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,594
Hello, Access Hollywood?

80
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:20,450
Have I got a star sighting
for you!

81
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:22,322
Very pawky, Jocelyn.

82
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:23,470
I just heard the big news.

83
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:25,733
A movie premiere
in our own backyard!

84
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,082
I might have to buy a dress!

85
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:29,432
Uh... save yourselves
the trip to Frocks4Less.

86
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,711
From what I've heard,

87
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,475
it's more of a minor league
viewing party.

88
00:03:32,563 --> 00:03:33,928
Well, I'm still excited.

89
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,263
It reminds me of that time that
Renée Zellweger's brother

90
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:38,259
came in here,
and I got him to sign a menu.

91
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:40,007
I mean, he spelled
his name differently,

92
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,746
but I swear it was him.

93
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:45,106
Well, I don't know, Moira,
I'm no movie expert,

94
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:46,893
but according to the early
reviews,

95
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:49,112
you may have a hit
on your hands.

96
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:50,536
- Reviews?
- Yeah.

97
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:52,190
There was an article posted
on the Crows account

98
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:54,453
that you made us all follow.
Come look!

99
00:03:57,097 --> 00:04:00,455
Ornithology Today!
Well, if anyone knows crows...

100
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:03,201
"The Crows Have Eyes III
is 'good fun.'"

101
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,815
Well, that's hyperbolic.
I mean, they already had "fun"

102
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:07,494
and now they've
added "good."

103
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:09,127
Keep reading!

104
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,452
"The film showcases
the emotional depth

105
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,256
and intellectual capacity

106
00:04:14,343 --> 00:04:17,781
of our oft-maligned friend,
the crow."

107
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:20,563
We were resolute about not
making an issues movie,

108
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:22,729
but I'm glad they picked up
on that.

109
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:24,318
It mentions you, Moira.

110
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:25,771
It does? Where?

111
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:27,182
My eyes are blurred.

112
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:28,642
Oh, here it is.

113
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,374
"Moira Rose,
as Dr. Clara Mandrake,

114
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:33,732
is delightfully unhinged."

115
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:36,427
Do you know what they call
this, gals?

116
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:38,279
An understated rave.

117
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:40,129
Oh, it's too bad you won't be
there tonight.

118
00:04:40,217 --> 00:04:41,963
It would've been nice
to cheer you on.

119
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:43,409
Yeah, and my plus-one,

120
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:45,436
Janet from the Elmdale
Chronicle,

121
00:04:45,524 --> 00:04:47,326
would've really loved a quote.

122
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:49,368
Well, you might want to tell
your friend Janet

123
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,065
that there just may be a
bombshell attendee after all.

124
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:56,106
Yay! A premiere!

125
00:04:56,194 --> 00:04:59,419
Oh, I don't know if I have
anything fancy enough to wear.

126
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,463
Oh, my default is always
formal,

127
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,171
but I'm sure no one will bat
a side-eye at black-tie casual.

128
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:08,166
Oh, but do pack eyedrops!

129
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:10,964
The film's first third is
densely packed with exposition,

130
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:12,780
and you won't want to blink.

131
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:14,888
Are you sure it's okay
that we haven't seen

132
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:16,087
the first two movies?

133
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:17,389
Oh, it's actually best.

134
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:19,239
A lot of this film
blatantly contradicts

135
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:22,020
what's been established
in the first two.

136
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:24,749
Sorry, Twyla.
I'm not going to eat now!

137
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:34,436
- Okay, here we go.
- That was a fun car ride.

138
00:05:34,524 --> 00:05:36,020
Yes, it was very fun.

139
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:38,673
Thank you so much
for all the hot tips

140
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:40,102
you were giving our Uber driver.

141
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,549
For a second, I was concerned
about my rating,

142
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:45,061
but I think he seemed to enjoy
all the wrong directions

143
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:46,380
you were yelling at him.

144
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:48,493
David, I'm hungry.

145
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,615
♪ I'm a hungry, hungry hippo

146
00:05:50,703 --> 00:05:52,475
'Kay, we're not supposed
to feed you right now.

147
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:54,644
Can you make me a lasagna,
David?

148
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:56,087
Imagine?
No.

149
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:57,613
I think we rest this
little voice,

150
00:05:57,701 --> 00:05:59,139
'cause you have been chatting
ever since

151
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,110
the dentist's office.
Why are you so handsome?

152
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:03,771
I mean, unless you wanna
keep talking.

153
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:05,449
In which case,
that works as well.

154
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:08,793
How come your skin is like...
perfect.

155
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,172
It's a nine-step regimen
I do twice a day.

156
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,666
- It's not a big deal.
- I'm tired.

157
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:14,178
Oh, okay.
Well, you know what,

158
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:16,243
we should probably get you
over to the bed.

159
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:17,587
O-kay.

160
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:20,020
You know what I really wanna do
with you?

161
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:22,069
Uh-huh. Ethically speaking,

162
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:24,270
I don't think we can do that
with you in this state.

163
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:25,714
Have a baby.

164
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,073
'Kay, we will make a baby

165
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,510
as soon as you sober up.

166
00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:33,962
Oh no, not make a baby.
Have a baby.

167
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,935
Like I wanna have like
a little baby with you.

168
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:41,764
And we could just love it
and hold it and bounce it.

169
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:43,680
Yeah, that's a...
that's a big one-eighty.

170
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:46,944
- You would be such a good dad.
- Have we met?

171
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,702
I wish you were my dad.

172
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:50,321
Okay, now we're just
spiraling off

173
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,219
- in all directions.
- Shh! Listen, okay?

174
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:54,055
Come here, come here.
I got a secret.

175
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:55,187
- I don't...
- Come on.

176
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:56,623
Mm...

177
00:06:57,612 --> 00:06:59,048
David?

178
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:01,497
I'm very hungry.

179
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:03,368
Okay, there's nothing I can
do about that.

180
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,948
- Wait. Just lie down with me.
- Okay.

181
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:07,775
- I wanna, I wanna hold you.
- Mmhmm.

182
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,446
Imagine us right now,

183
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,259
but just with a little baby.

185
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:25,666
- Hey, Stevie!
- Hey...

186
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:26,897
Hey.

187
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:30,704
- Oh! What's this?
- Thank you.

188
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,324
You didn't have to bring
anything.

189
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:34,534
Oh, just a little
housewarming platter,

190
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,471
since it's my first time here.

191
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:38,338
Twyla whipped up
some sandwiches.

192
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:40,500
- Hope you like mayo.
- Thank you.

193
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:42,939
Wow, so this is,
this is your place.

194
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:46,476
I'm glad you didn't feel
you needed to clean up

195
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:47,883
on my account,
you know?

196
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:50,756
It shows just how comfortable
a friendship we actually have.

197
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:53,103
- I did clean up.
- Right.

198
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:55,355
That's... what I meant.

199
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:57,097
You didn't feel the need
to clean up,

200
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,521
but I appreciate the fact that,
uh, that you did.

201
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,787
How are things at the motel?

202
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:06,937
Good. We bought the second
motel!

203
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:10,986
First phase of many in
the Rosebud Motel expansion.

204
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:13,112
Big things on the horizon,
Stevie,

205
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,297
which is, uh, why I wanted
to sit down with you today.

206
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:17,583
But not on your bed.

207
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:19,464
Oh, here.

208
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,885
Right.

209
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:26,057
So... Stevie,

210
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:28,661
it goes without saying that...

211
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:31,120
you've been an invaluable part
of the team.

212
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:33,184
You don't need to sell me
on the team, Mr. Rose.

213
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:36,101
And when I was your age,
I had a million and one ideas

214
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:37,897
and things I wanted to explore,

215
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,292
and I know it takes time
to find the right fit.

216
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:43,434
Which is why I have a proposal.

217
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:45,619
Oh! Okay.

218
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:47,314
I wanna buy you out.

219
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:49,811
Oh!

220
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:52,148
Now I know the motel has been
a weight on your shoulders,

221
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:54,108
and I can offer you
installment payments

222
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:55,980
to give up your status as owner.

223
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,287
And that would give you
some financial stability

224
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,900
while you take the time
and figure things out.

225
00:09:04,552 --> 00:09:07,853
I thought you were gonna try
to talk me into coming back.

226
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:09,900
Oh, no, no.
That wouldn't be fair.

227
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:12,168
Wouldn't be fair to you.
I'm not gonna stand in the way

228
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:14,345
of you finding
what makes you happy.

229
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,000
And, and speaking of,
I wanted to give you this.

230
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:29,390
Oh, wow...

231
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:32,764
I don't know what to say.

232
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:34,639
Well, once you get past
the haircut

233
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:36,602
and... the dated references,

234
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,025
I'm sure you might find
something useful in there

235
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:41,376
to help you get your footing.

236
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,142
You don't have to downplay
your excitement

237
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,866
on my account, Stevie.

238
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:48,510
I'll be just fine.

239
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:00,978
Okay, so I may have a problem.

240
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:02,733
Oh, it's barely noticeable,
dear.

241
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,446
We'll find you an electrologist.

242
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:06,318
No, I'm talking about
the viewing party.

243
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,102
I just got a call
from the Elmdale Chronicle.

244
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:09,713
Ah yes, Jocelyn's guest.

245
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,347
We'll need to set aside
an extra seat.

246
00:10:11,435 --> 00:10:12,991
Okay, it's just that I know
that you don't wanna make

247
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:15,286
a big deal about of this,
so I can just tell them not to come.

248
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:17,995
I may have been wrong and
you may have been not wrong.

249
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:20,738
We can position this
as a terrifying tale

250
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:24,129
premiering in an equally
spine-chilling town.

251
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:26,982
If the ornithologist review
is any barometer, Alexis,

252
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,768
we m-m-m-m-m may just have
a hit on our hands.

253
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,020
Um, last week,
you told me explicitly

254
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:34,041
that this was not a premiere,
and now it's too late.

255
00:10:34,128 --> 00:10:35,913
Alexis, if you want to cut
your teeth

256
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,541
as a high-profile publicist,

257
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:39,743
you'll need to get used
to throwing things together

258
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,832
in a crunch.
I have four hours!

259
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,094
That's eons!

260
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:45,924
When Demi decided
on a Friday night at 6pm

261
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:48,672
that she wanted to celebrate
her 40th in Aspen,

262
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,276
her publicist had us
in parkas by 7.

263
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:54,465
Sadly, Megan went into cardiac
arrest on the flight,

264
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,023
but she perished doing
what she loved.

265
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,676
Um, is that your gown?
What is that for?

266
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:02,632
Oh, I thought I might
throw it on for tonight.

267
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:04,115
So you're going to
the screening?

268
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:05,993
Yes. A simple
"Thank you, Mother"

269
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:07,858
might be a nice place to start.

270
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:09,584
Also, I thought you returned
that?

271
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:11,818
I did! Or I know I returned
a dress.

272
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,653
A glittering, backless thing.

273
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:14,946
Stella McCartney, I think.

274
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,953
That was mine.
I've been looking for that.

275
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,389
- Blame UPS.
- Ugh!

276
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:30,971
Hey, Alexis,
this better be good.

277
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:33,303
I was in the middle of
a pre-show bath,

278
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:34,522
and with the baby around,

279
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:37,243
I only get that kind
of me-time maybe...

280
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:38,812
- five to six nights a week, so...
- Mmhmm.

281
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,707
I assume this has something
to do

282
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:42,754
with all the calls
we're getting from TV stations,

283
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:44,532
asking where they can park
their vans?

284
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:46,555
Um, yeah. So the premiere may
be getting

285
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:47,930
like a little bit bigger
than I had

286
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:48,921
- planned.
- Oh, sanp!

287
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:49,973
It's a premiere now?

288
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,278
'Cause first you said it was,

289
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:53,193
and then you said it was
just a viewing party.

290
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,755
Yeah, and, and if it's a
premiere, we're all in trouble,

291
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:58,027
because my skinny jeans
are in the wash.

292
00:11:58,305 --> 00:11:59,625
No, it is a premiere.

293
00:11:59,713 --> 00:12:02,205
Unfortunately, that decision
was made like half an hour ago,

294
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:03,419
so it would be really helpful

295
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:04,847
if I could just tell you
what I need.

296
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:07,500
Oh no, the red carpet that
you told me not to order?

297
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:09,015
Yes, but at this point,

298
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,343
I will settle for any shade
of red,

299
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,853
and it doesn't have to be
sixty feet.

300
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,423
Okay, good,
'cause all I've got

301
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:15,260
is a 20-foot merlot
in my garage.

302
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:18,023
I ripped out after the church
basement flooded.

303
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:19,471
That sounds amazing.

304
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,222
And obviously you're coming
to me for a little star power.

305
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,659
I get it. It'd be good to have
a name there tonight.

306
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:26,749
No. No. You're the crow
hook-up.

307
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:28,989
I wanted to create like
a headline-grabbing moment

308
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:30,259
where I release a bunch of crows

309
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:31,873
just before the movie starts.

310
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:34,877
Uh, excuse me,
it's a little late notice.

311
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:36,314
What about the liquor license?

312
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:38,229
'Cause I assuming people are
gonna wanna be drinking

313
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:39,310
through this thing.

314
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:40,965
Okay, we have a situation
on our hands

315
00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:42,547
that needs to be solved now.

316
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:45,376
We have a 12-time Daytime Emmy
Award-attending actress

317
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:47,682
coming to walk a merlot carpet
in hours,

318
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:49,336
and press coming from all over,

319
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:51,164
bringing attention to your town.

320
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,905
So either you can help me out

321
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:55,169
or I pull the plug now
and nobody wins.

322
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:01,769
Fine. But you owe me a prime
spot on that carpet.

323
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:04,264
Wait, you wanna walk
the carpet?

324
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:07,137
Honey, it's a movie premiere,
is it not?

325
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:08,965
- Ugh.
- And I assume the mayor

326
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:10,967
is walking the carpet as well,
yes?

327
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:12,945
Yes... if he has to.

328
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:16,319
Okay, I will schedule your
arrival time when I get home.

329
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:19,055
I would like to request
a time before Roland.

330
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:20,818
- And I'd like to go first.
- Mm-'kay.

331
00:13:20,906 --> 00:13:21,935
All right, I better get back

332
00:13:22,022 --> 00:13:23,755
and put my skinny jeans
into the dryer.

333
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:26,608
I think they're really gonna
pop on your 20-foot merlot.

334
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:27,940
I think so too!

335
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:29,787
They're gonna pop on
that carpet.

336
00:13:30,454 --> 00:13:31,813
Okay. Mm!

337
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:32,946
Okay.

338
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:34,157
Okay.

339
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,476
Stevie! Perfect timing.

340
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:45,707
I was having a technical issue
opening a file here.

341
00:13:45,795 --> 00:13:47,997
It's, uh, being finicky.

342
00:13:48,134 --> 00:13:50,702
Uh, remember, Mr. Rose?
I left you a sticky note.

343
00:13:53,247 --> 00:13:55,619
Ah! Boy, it's times like this

344
00:13:55,707 --> 00:13:58,014
I really miss having you
around, Stevie.

345
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:00,415
Well, um, that's kind of what
I wanted to talk to you about,

346
00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:02,241
Mr. Rose.
Um, you know

347
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:04,107
how you told me
to take some time

348
00:14:04,194 --> 00:14:06,627
and figure out what made me
happy?

349
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,460
Well, I think I have settled
on something.

350
00:14:09,645 --> 00:14:11,157
Is it Larry Air?

351
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:13,072
'Cause they called me
for a reference,

352
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:17,042
and also asked if I had any
interest in becoming a pilot.

353
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:19,557
No, it's not Larry Air.

354
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:21,777
So chapter one of your book

355
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:23,867
is all about trusting
your instincts,

356
00:14:23,955 --> 00:14:25,650
and I haven't been doing that.

357
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,513
Oh, well, that's okay, Stevie.

358
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,245
I mean, learning to trust
your instincts

359
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,613
is something that comes
with age and experience.

360
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:36,516
No. I'm talking about
trusting your instincts.

361
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:38,947
I think I've been taking them
for granted.

362
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:41,830
So, you read my book?

363
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,937
Most of the first chapter.

364
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,679
I didn't sleep well last night,
so I kind of dozed off.

365
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,540
Well, the first chapter is
more of an introduction, right?

366
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:53,282
Setting the table.

367
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:56,251
'Kay, but what I've realized

368
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:59,151
is that you've given me
the opportunity

369
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:00,946
to take this job
and run with it.

370
00:15:01,153 --> 00:15:04,513
So, if you really think
you can make something

371
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:06,952
out of franchising this motel,

372
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:09,911
I think I want to be part of it.

373
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:11,565
You think?

374
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,419
I wanna be part of it.

375
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:16,130
I want back in.

376
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,576
Oh!

377
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:26,406
Yeah.

378
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:30,050
Well, I... should probably
tell you

379
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,892
that you don't necessarily have
to trust all my instincts...

380
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:35,894
all the time.
Since you've been gone,

381
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:39,033
I did have to bring on
a third business partner,

382
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:40,456
and I may as well tell you
that it's...

383
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,671
Roland. I know.

384
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,252
He gave me his new business
card.

385
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,035
Never saw so many typos
on a business card.

386
00:15:46,122 --> 00:15:48,949
Do you mind if we don't talk
about Roland right now,

387
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:51,508
'cause I'm feeling really good
about this decision.

388
00:15:51,596 --> 00:15:53,265
Ah! Yeah, me too, partner.

389
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,619
Me too.

390
00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:56,521
Listen, while you're here,

391
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:58,696
I'm wondering if I can get
a couple more refreshers

392
00:15:58,784 --> 00:16:01,970
on... what happens after
the file gets opened?

393
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:08,263
Uh... you may as well.
Yeah.

394
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:16,142
Morning, sunshine.

395
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,988
Mm. It's 5pm.

396
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:19,315
But good morning.

397
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:22,449
I really don't remember
how I got into this bed.

398
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:24,126
I do.

399
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:26,369
You were talking.

400
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,898
- A lot.
- Uhoh.

401
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:31,439
- What was I saying?
- Well,

402
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:33,122
the conversation really ran
the gamut.

403
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,768
You complimented
my flawless skin

404
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:36,684
and called me the Jewish
Channing Tatum,

405
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:38,604
which all tracks.

406
00:16:38,884 --> 00:16:42,583
But then you told me
you wanted us to have a baby.

407
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:45,955
What else did I say?

408
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:47,610
I put you to sleep after that.

409
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,297
Wait. Are you,
are you joking?

410
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:51,474
No. No, no.
You held me close

411
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:53,924
and told me to envision
our lives...

412
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,290
with a child.

413
00:16:56,137 --> 00:16:58,226
- I see.
- Mm-hm.

414
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:01,226
That, uh, that must've
been scary for you.

415
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:04,257
It was a little triggering.
Traumatizing.

416
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,357
David, I know that you don't
want kids,

417
00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:09,640
and that's fine with me,
okay?

418
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:11,442
I was very high on anesthetic.

419
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,109
Okay, it's just that earlier
today,

420
00:17:13,197 --> 00:17:14,256
when we were in Stevie's car

421
00:17:14,343 --> 00:17:15,748
because your car's always
in the shop,

422
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,005
you had mentioned that you'd
always pictured yourself

423
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:19,473
having a kid.

424
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:21,073
You've never pictured
yourself doing something

425
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,732
- that didn't end up happening?
- Of course.

426
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,019
I'm not married
to Christina Aguilera, am I?

427
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:26,975
- David, I am happy...
- But it's...

428
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:28,697
with the life I've got.

429
00:17:29,147 --> 00:17:30,671
I'm happy with you.

430
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:32,479
Things change.

431
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:35,245
Okay.

432
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,682
You're a hundred percent sure

433
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,164
you're not just saying
you don't wanna have a kid,

434
00:17:39,252 --> 00:17:41,011
but, in actuality,
you secretly do

435
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:44,102
and are repressing that need
just for me?

436
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:46,096
I don't wanna undermine
the significance

437
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:48,005
of this conversation,
but I do wanna make it known

438
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:49,941
that I was watching
"Bridget Jones's Baby"

439
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:51,570
right before I went under.

440
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:54,191
Okay, well that makes
a little more sense then.

441
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:57,108
Mm. You would be a great dad,
though.

442
00:17:58,308 --> 00:17:59,330
Okay.

443
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:01,322
You have a big old heart
in there, David.

444
00:18:01,435 --> 00:18:03,132
- Yeah. Yeah,
- There it is.

445
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:05,567
- It's beating away.
- Mmhmm?

446
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,299
Um... Can you grab me
those painkillers, please?

447
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:10,874
I think I'm gonna need
a few of them

448
00:18:10,962 --> 00:18:12,304
if we're still planning on
making it

449
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,495
to your mom's thing tonight.

450
00:18:13,582 --> 00:18:15,297
Okay, that's actually
a very good idea.

451
00:18:16,102 --> 00:18:17,315
I might take one myself.

452
00:18:17,403 --> 00:18:20,247
Apparently the first 15 minutes
are very, very dense.

453
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,522
<i>Moira! Over here!</i>

454
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:28,511
<i>Moira! Moira!</i>

455
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:30,323
Well, break a leg, sweetheart.

456
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:31,847
I'll be right here...

457
00:18:31,935 --> 00:18:33,334
10 feet behind you.

458
00:18:33,422 --> 00:18:35,424
No, John, tonight is special,

459
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:38,623
and I'd like my hand-candy
by my side.

460
00:18:38,711 --> 00:18:39,847
- <i>Moira!</i>
- Oh.

461
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:40,966
<i>Moira!</i>

462
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,676
Okay, people, we actually
need to walk the carpet, okay?

463
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:46,386
Move it along.
Ronnie? Look, we had a deal.

464
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:49,041
Also, not everyone can be on
the carpet at once.

465
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,152
Thank you.

466
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,566
When exactly are we gonna get
this show on the road?

467
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:54,107
As soon as you're off
the carpet.

468
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:55,849
Okay, because Carmine
is saying

469
00:18:55,963 --> 00:18:57,453
that the crows are getting
restless.

470
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,463
Mm!

471
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:00,184
Where did all these people
come from?

472
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,115
Why are your pupils
so dilated.

473
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:04,015
- No, yours are.
- No, yours are.

474
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:07,025
Why are you dressed
like a limo driver?

475
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,437
Your mother insisted.

476
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,657
Why are you both glassy eyed?

477
00:19:10,745 --> 00:19:11,964
What?

478
00:19:12,054 --> 00:19:13,149
Wow!

479
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:16,156
So the crows are ready.
You just say a few words,

480
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:17,623
and then give Carmine
the signal.

481
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:19,377
Alexis,
Mommy's home now.

482
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:21,229
I'll take it from here.

483
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:23,624
Ladies and gentlemen,

484
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:26,333
it is my great pleasure
to welcome you

485
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:28,814
to a North American
screening of...

486
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:30,697
the psychological thriller...

487
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:31,919
Move it along.

488
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:35,445
"The Crows Have Eyes III:
The Crowening!"

489
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:40,076
Let the crowening commence!

490
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:41,910
Oh!

491
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:46,449
Alexis!

492
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:50,235
- Oh ho!
- No!

493
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,699
Please, everyone stay
calm!

494
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:55,200
Whatever you do,
do not look them in the eye!

495
00:19:55,288 --> 00:19:56,704
Okay, you're making them
angrier!

496
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:57,834
I'm not, Alexis!

497
00:19:57,922 --> 00:19:59,792
I know a bit of their language.

498
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,313
CAW!

499
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,265
CAW-CAW!

500
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,669
This is fucked.

501
00:20:13,526 --> 00:20:16,742
The worst part is people are
being robbed of the experience

502
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,632
of seeing the film
on the big screen.

503
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,699
No, that's not the worst
part, Moira.

504
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,654
It's fine. There were no
serious injuries,

505
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:25,721
and, because people are
watching from home,

506
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,103
there'll be more views that way.

507
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:28,483
Okay, have you seen this yet?

508
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:31,763
Some random news station just
posted video of the premiere.

509
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,965
It's been shared 32,000 times.

510
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:37,133
Well, all press is good
press, right?

511
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:39,096
You might wanna watch it
first.

512
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:41,725
Tonight, a murder
of wild crows attacked

513
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:42,816
would-be audience members

514
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:45,389
who had come to see a movie
about a crow attack.

515
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:47,771
We must warn you,
the following content is pretty graphic.

516
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:51,122
Oh!

517
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,255
Okay, they weren't
"wild" crows.

518
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:54,898
They were supposed to be
trained.

519
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:57,091
Trained! Some of them were
painted seagulls.

520
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:58,989
This is not good, Alexis!

521
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:01,204
It sorta looks like people
are running away

522
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:02,602
from your movie, Moira.

523
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,263
You! Look
what you have done!

524
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:06,838
Look what I've done?
This was your idea,

525
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:09,227
and now I have to pay Ronnie
for damage to her carpet!

526
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:11,652
What were the crows even
doing there in the first place?

527
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,995
It's called an immersive
experience, David!

528
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,368
Immersed in lawsuits maybe.

529
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:20,015
Alexis, make it stop!

530
00:21:20,142 --> 00:21:22,074

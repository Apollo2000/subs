00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:16,389
- Johnny: Moira! Moira!
- Moira: Hm.

5
00:00:16,424 --> 00:00:18,425
Moira: Oh no!

6
00:00:18,459 --> 00:00:20,660
I just finally cried myself to sleep.

7
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:22,329
Johnny: The bed is soaking wet.

8
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:24,163
Moira: Is it blood?

9
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:26,065
Johnny: No! There's...
there is leak in the ceiling.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,167
There is a brown disgusting drip coming.

11
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:29,802
Moira: Owwww!

12
00:00:29,837 --> 00:00:32,171
Johnny: Look it! Look... oh my God.

13
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:34,207
- Moira: I can't do it.
- Johnny: This place is a dump! It's a dump

14
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,041
- Moira: I tried!
- Johnny: You know what it's a hell hole.

15
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:37,477
I tired, John, but I can't!

16
00:00:37,511 --> 00:00:38,845
Johnny: Wake up.

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,446
- David: Ahh!
- Alexis: Ahh!

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,249
Johnny: Start packing, the pluming
is shot to hell in this place

19
00:00:43,283 --> 00:00:45,718
and we are getting out. We are getting out!

20
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:47,519
David: What are you wearing?
What is that? A nightgown?

21
00:00:47,554 --> 00:00:49,588
Johnny: It's a nightshirt,
David. And that's not the issue.

22
00:00:49,623 --> 00:00:51,891
The issue is the brown sludge in my bed.

23
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:53,325
We're selling the place!

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,160
David: It's 6:00 am!

25
00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:57,529
Johnny: What's the name of that
mouthy kid at the front desk?

26
00:00:57,564 --> 00:00:59,365
David: I don't know. I'm trying very
hard not to connect with people right now.

27
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,500
The mouth the mouth, the girl.

28
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:03,369
David: You might want to
rethink the nightgown first.

29
00:01:03,403 --> 00:01:05,437
There's an ebenezer scrooge
thing happening right now.

30
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:07,439
Alexis: Oh my God, that's
who I was thinking of.

31
00:01:07,474 --> 00:01:09,074
Johnny: You know what?! I'll do it myself.

32
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:10,876
My best to Bob Cratchit.

Hello! Hello! Service?

37
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:32,129
This bell is broken.

38
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:34,365
Stevie: Yeah, sorry.

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,867
It's more or less decorative.

40
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:39,737
Johnny: There's a leak in my room.

41
00:01:39,772 --> 00:01:43,775
Brown, disgusting sewage water was
dripping all over my bed this morning.

42
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:47,344
I was soaking wet. So I need a plumber.

43
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:51,081
Stevie: You want me to call a plumber?

44
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:52,049
Johnny: (Incredulous) Do I
want you to call a plumber?

45
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,418
Yes, yes I do. I want you call...

46
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:55,519
You should already be on the phone.

47
00:01:55,553 --> 00:01:57,221
Could you call a plumber?

48
00:01:57,255 --> 00:02:01,625
Stevie let's see if he's
home... or conscious.

49
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:03,527
He's a good guy, he's just a big drinker.

50
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:05,429
Johnny: I also need a real estate agent.

51
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:08,365
The name of a good real
estate agent right away.

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,067
Stevie: Ooh, there's a guy named Ray.

53
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:17,340
Yeah. He's the best one.
He's also the only one so...

54
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:19,642
A guy named Ray...

55
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:24,097
Stevie: Is there anything else
I can help you with, Mr. Rose?

56
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:26,265
Yes. My wife and I will be taking breakfast

57
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,867
in our room this morning.

58
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:31,571
Eggs florentine and a yoghurt parfait.

59
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:33,472
Stevie: Yeah... unfortunately,
due to a lack of everything,

60
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:35,774
we don't do room service.

61
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:37,276
Uh, but you're always
welcome to help yourself

62
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:42,047
to our complimentary espresso bar.

63
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:43,482
Johnny: I'd rather drink the pipe-water.

64
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:45,818
Stevie: I hear ya.

65
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:50,488
Alexis: Ew! Who even is this girl?

66
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:52,157
He said he'd never date someone
with a toe ring and yet...

67
00:02:56,262 --> 00:02:58,864
- Moira: Rub my back.
- David: What?! No.

68
00:02:58,898 --> 00:03:01,133
Moira: I rubbed your back many
a nights when you were little.

69
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,468
David: Yeah, in exchange
for half my allowance.

70
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:07,105
Moira: Fine. You may select one
silver piece from my accessory case.

71
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:08,740
- Right here.
- Alexis: Omigod...

72
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:11,309
she has hakuna matata tattooed on her foot.

73
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:13,978
David: Stavros was
seeing escorts before you.

74
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:16,248
A Disney tattoo shouldn't be a surprise.

75
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:18,082
We said no social media post
breakup. We had a pact about that.

76
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,852
David: He dates hooker.

77
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:23,788
Oh, well, I'm sorry, I don't
hire my friends at model castings.

78
00:03:23,823 --> 00:03:25,723
Actually, now that I think about
in, where are those friends?

79
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:27,291
David: They're just
giving me space right now.

80
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:28,860
Because they're considered people.

81
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:30,462
<i>Alexis: Oh right. Space. Yeah.</i>

82
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:31,663
David: Okay. Well, I think
it's bests that he dumped you.

83
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:33,865
Alexis: He didn't dump me.

84
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:37,535
We actually both decided that it was
best that he see other people so...

85
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,205
Moira: Children, mindless bickering
is a luxury we may no longer afford.

86
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,409
You are blind to reality
and for that I am most proud

87
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:47,744
but our worlds evil twin...
has reared her ugly...

88
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:49,313
David: Okay. I'm taking my
journal into the bathroom.

89
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:51,548
Where I will be shutting the door.

90
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,650
David! You might actually wanna hear this.

91
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:54,918
(Slams door)

92
00:03:58,723 --> 00:04:00,591
Ray: Oh hi!

93
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,058
Johnny: Are you Ray?

94
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:03,426
- Ray: Yes.
- Johnny: You're late.

95
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:05,395
Johnny Rrose. My wife, Moira.

96
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:07,197
- Moira: Hello.
- Ray: Hi.

97
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:10,066
Oh, I love your complexion.

98
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:13,303
Ray: So... what can I help you with,

99
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:16,606
housing, investment opportunities?

100
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,174
Moira: Mr. Rose and I would
like to put a for sale sign

101
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,743
on this incredible town.

102
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:22,412
Johnny: We're willing to
settle for what we paid for it.

103
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:25,781
More if you can get it,
but definitely not less.

104
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:29,485
Ray: Well, I'm not gonna lie
to you I'm not super optimistic.

105
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,087
You know, because the government
saw no value in Schitt's Creek.

106
00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:34,289
<i>You know, when they
repossessed your assets.</i>

107
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:35,658
You know, because of the humiliating...

108
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,159
Johnny: Yes, we know. We know. We know.

109
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,729
Ray: Well, we'll do our best.

110
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:41,463
First we just have to get
Roland to sign off on the listing

111
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:45,067
and then we're good to go.

112
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:49,138
I need to confer with the
financial powerhouse of the family.

113
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:53,175
Since when did the mayor
need to sign off on this?

114
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,911
Johnny: Ray, since when did the
mayor need to sign off on this?

115
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,746
Ray: Well, it's all here...

116
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,654
Son of a bitch!

117
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:07,856
<i>(Cart rattles)</i>

118
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:11,793
David: Oh, excuse me.

119
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:12,694
I don't think my sheets have been cleaned.

120
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:14,829
They smell like cigarettes.

121
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:16,330
Stevie: No, that's just the way they smell.

122
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:18,732
Also, you can tell your dad
that the plumber was busy

123
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:20,568
so I just pushed the bed against the wall

124
00:05:20,602 --> 00:05:22,836
and put down a bucket where the bed was.

125
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:24,272
David: Okay. We're gonna
be selling the town,

126
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:26,074
so it'll be someone else's problem soon.

127
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:29,277
Stevie: But it's such
a great place to live.

128
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:30,511
I think you're funny.

129
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:33,481
Thank you.

130
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:36,917
Um, look I know this
probably isn't your thing,

131
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:40,420
but there's a tailgate party later.

132
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:43,190
It's not exactly clubbing
but you know... close.

133
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:44,524
I don't even know what 'tailgate' means.

134
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:47,360
In my mind I'm picturing like a Klan rally.

135
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:49,930
Stevie: Yeah, just fewer pointy hats.

136
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:53,500
It's just townies with un-ironic haircuts.

137
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:55,235
David: Okay. I'm gonna pass
I'm not really in the mood

138
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:56,236
to be a victim of a
hate crime tonight so...

139
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,838
Alexis: Okay.

140
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:00,973
Stavros just posted three more photos.

141
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:03,043
Who are these jenky women?

142
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:05,245
Uh, from the looks of it they're
blonde and mostly naked so...

143
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,280
(Exasperated exhale)

144
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:08,848
Is there a bar in this place

145
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:11,651
or are we in one of
those religo cult towns?

146
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:12,885
Stevie: I was just telling your
brother about a party tonight.

147
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,354
But he passed so...

148
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:18,557
Alexis: Um, yes. Love that journey for me.

149
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:21,661
Okay, so I'm looking
for a guy like a mechanic

150
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,430
or someone that hammers stuff.

151
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:28,467
Um, at least 5'7. Kind of like full lips.

152
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:31,670
Athletic body. Maybe a
neck tattoo would be cute.

153
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:34,306
David: No, it wouldn't.

154
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:36,408
You know, I think this
could be really good for me.

155
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:39,278
So thank you.

156
00:06:39,312 --> 00:06:42,480
Stevie: You're welcome. Yeah.
I'm looking forward to it.

157
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:45,117
Having all that fun.

158
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,986
Wow.

159
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:52,991
(Birds chirp)

160
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:56,261
Roland: So Johnny Rose wants
the ol' Johnny Hancock, huh?

161
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:57,662
Johnny: Well... (Chuckles)

162
00:06:57,696 --> 00:06:58,929
Shouldn't be a problem, Johnny.

163
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:01,366
I'm happy to signoff on the listing.

164
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,401
Johnny: Well, thank you, very
much, Rolland, I appreciated.

165
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:05,403
Roland: Sure. Why don't you
come over tonight and pick it up.

166
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:07,539
<i>Johnny: Mr. Mayor, that's not necessary.</i>

167
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:10,007
No, no. Roland, a
signature, that's all I need.

168
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:11,476
Roland: Johnny look, here
is what you're gonna do;

169
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,678
you're gonna grab the kids,
you're gonna grab Moira,

170
00:07:13,712 --> 00:07:15,445
you're gonna come over we're gonna
sit down like civilized people,

171
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,848
have a few laughs,

172
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:20,384
and then at the end of the evening
we'll get to the big signing, okay?

173
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:23,087
Johnny: Right. Okay.
Honestly Roland, it's just a,

174
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:25,489
it's just a signature. A
flick of the wrist. That's it.

175
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:27,692
Roland: You're not rejecting
my hospitality, are you, Johnny?

176
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:29,393
Because that really wouldn't be a good way

177
00:07:29,427 --> 00:07:31,828
to start things off, I don't think.

178
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:35,666
Johnny: No, no. I'd love to come
to dinner are you kidding me?

179
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,334
No. I just thought,
let's do business first,

180
00:07:37,368 --> 00:07:39,570
get the signature, and then dinner.

181
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:43,073
Johnny, you want that,
to get that you need this.

182
00:07:43,107 --> 00:07:45,309
So let's just do this my way.

183
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:47,911
Johnny: Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, dinner is.

184
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:50,613
Roland: Dinner it is, atta boy. Okay.

185
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:57,020
Moira: How did you not get
the contract signed, John?

186
00:07:57,054 --> 00:08:01,257
Can one thing, just one thing,
not be easy in this town?!

187
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,559
Johnny: Look Roland's playing
games, honey, he's playing games.

188
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:06,061
So this is something we have to do.

189
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:07,996
Alexis: Okay. Well, I would love to go,

190
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:10,099
but I've actually double booked myself.

191
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:13,569
I'm going to a truck party
um, with the front desk girl

192
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:15,804
<i>and obviously she'd be super devastated</i>

193
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,707
if I bailed last minute. So I can't.

194
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:20,342
I can't go.

195
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,744
Johnny: Okay. Well, cancel it
because you're coming to dinner.

196
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:23,445
Alexis: No.

197
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,147
One of you kids has to come.

198
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:26,681
Davis, you've got nothing on tonight.

199
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:27,950
How... how do you know that.

200
00:08:27,984 --> 00:08:29,952
What do you have on tonight?

201
00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:31,620
- David: What?
- Johnny: Good, it's settled.

202
00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:33,455
Moira: Or you could go alone, John.

203
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:36,324
Since you are the one who did
not get the contract signed.

204
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:40,428
Johnny: Moira, Roland wants
the family there tonight,

205
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:42,731
so my family has to go tonight.

206
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:44,532
Let me explain something about business.

207
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:47,068
- Moira: Don't you dare...
- Johnny: It's a dance.

208
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:50,071
And sometimes you lead.
and sometimes you follow.

209
00:08:50,105 --> 00:08:51,373
Moira: And which are you doing now, John?

210
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:54,208
Johnny: I am leading, Moira.

211
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,710
Moira: In a Roland game
I think you're following.

212
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,026
Following in the game but
leading in the dance, right?

213
00:09:03,297 --> 00:09:05,364
And he thinks he's leading in the dance,

214
00:09:05,398 --> 00:09:09,901
but only because I've
allowed him to think...

215
00:09:09,936 --> 00:09:11,704
- Moira: Are you listening to this?
- David: Hmm?

216
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:13,905
Johnny: It doesn't matter. I'm leading.

217
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,441
Moira: I'll shall bathe.

218
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:20,345
And if I bang my head and
slip beneath the surface,

219
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:22,214
so be it, Mr. Rose. (Slams door)

220
00:09:25,218 --> 00:09:27,152
- Johnny: What's this?
- David: Uh yeah, Stevie called.

221
00:09:27,186 --> 00:09:30,288
Apparently the plumber's in rehab.

222
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:33,958
And you also... you
have something on your...

223
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:35,894
I don't know what that is but it's a thing.

224
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:39,229
<i>Alexis: David, for the gate party tonight
is it more of a leather pants thing or... </i>

225
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:40,430
Son of a bitch!

226
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:45,375
<i>Thanks for having us, Jocelyn. Thank you.</i>

227
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,782
Jocelyn: Make yourselves at home.
Roland is just on the toilet.

228
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:50,851
Johnny: Oh, what a surprise.

229
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:56,026
David: You have a really lovely
home. It's really um, understated.

230
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,263
Jocelyn: Thank you. I get a
lot of my ideas from magazines.

231
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:01,064
- Moira: Don't be modest.
- (Toilet flushes)

232
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:04,567
This is 100 percent you and only you.

233
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:07,871
Roland hey, okay. It's
the Roses. (Chuckles)

234
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,031
Come on, folk, please sit.

235
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:15,201
Come on, I'm just the
mayor for crying out loud.

236
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:18,004
<i>Ooh, hors d'oeuvres. Mmm.</i>

237
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:20,640
Jocelyn: That's too bad about Alexis.

238
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:23,409
Well, it is. But we did
bring the life of the party.

239
00:10:23,443 --> 00:10:25,911
- Moira: Our David.
- (Johnny chuckles)

240
00:10:25,945 --> 00:10:28,647
Roland: Well, I guess, that just means
there is more for you and me, right Dave?

241
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:31,283
Jocelyn: I hope everyone
likes a cheeseball.

242
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:34,220
Cheeseball? (Polite chuckle)

243
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:36,222
It's the treat that keeps
our love life percolating.

244
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:38,057
It's like an aphrodisiac with him.

245
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:39,992
Go ahead.

246
00:10:40,026 --> 00:10:43,729
Johnny: Oh yes, can't
wait. Can't wait. Mmm.

247
00:10:43,763 --> 00:10:48,667
Jocelyn: So David, tell us about
yourself I hear you're a gallerist.

248
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:51,036
Roland: Wow. There's a $10 dollar word.

249
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,437
Moira: David owned a brilliant gallery.

250
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:54,072
Tell them about your last show.

251
00:10:54,106 --> 00:10:55,640
- David: It's not...
- Moira: You must, please.

252
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:57,875
Johnny: Tell them, David, tell them.

253
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:00,210
David: The gallery worked
with Janet Kempfluugen.

254
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:02,580
Johnny: Kempfluugen?

255
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:05,282
She's a Brooklyn based performance
artist she's a big deal.

256
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:07,852
Anyway um... she would walk into the space

257
00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:11,356
wearing a clay mask of a fawn,

258
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,860
remove her clothing and breast
feed members of the audience.

259
00:11:15,894 --> 00:11:18,262
It was a commentary on income inequality.

260
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:22,900
Roland: Wow...

261
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:24,468
Johnny: Heady stuff.

262
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:26,070
Roland: Well, hmm...

263
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,205
Alexis: Lipgloss?

264
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,808
Stevie: No thank you.

265
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:33,276
Alexis: I wish I could pull off
the whole gloomy, no makeup look.

266
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,612
It's so French.

267
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:36,813
Stevie: Thank you.

268
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:38,348
Alexis: So, why are you single?

269
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:40,316
Stevie: Who said I'm single?

270
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:42,218
Alexis: Girl, we're on the
hunt. I hope you're single.

271
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,654
Stevie: Oh, no. I'm not "on the hunt".

272
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:46,555
A town this size, you've
either been through 'em

273
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,924
or know a little too much about 'em.

274
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,692
Alexis: Hmm. Okay. I'm gonna go do a lap

275
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:52,061
and this swan is best when she flies solo.

276
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:54,730
- So you're gonna be okay?
- Stevie: I live here.

277
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:56,565
- Alexis: Okay. Am I good?
- Stevie: Hm-hm.

278
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,069
- Alexis: Yes? Okay. Thank
you. - Stevie: Are you not cold-

279
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:01,137
Chuck, beer!

280
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,375
(Effort grunts)

281
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,143
Roland: I know it's gotta
be in here somewhere,

282
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:10,345
<i>slippery little bastard.</i>

283
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,115
Johnny: Maybe a fork would help, Roland?

284
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,952
Roland: Oh, that's sweet. Thank
you. I'm okay. I'll find it.

285
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,854
Johnny: So is that the
ah, contract over there?

286
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:22,590
Yeah, it is. You know, I
gotta be honest with you,

287
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,693
I tried reading that
thing it is really boring.

288
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,429
Ah, got it! There she is! Okay.

289
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:33,668
Ohh! Oh my God, honey... oh, that is good.

290
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,639
<i>That is good.</i>

291
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,642
Moira: I believe you were saying, John.

292
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,945
Johnny: Yes. This reminds me of
a merger I put together in Zurich.

293
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:46,180
It was two families
breaking bread together.

294
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:49,317
<i>David: Ahh! Agh. My head. My head hurts.</i>

295
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,485
<i>Jocelyn: Oh no! Are you okay?</i>

296
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,021
David: Um, it think it's the
migraines that I get a lot.

297
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:56,824
Johnny: Oh, I think... I
think that'll pass, David.

298
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:58,892
I don't think it's gonna pass.
I don't think it's passing.

299
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:01,362
Jocelyn: Migraines can be so awful.

300
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:03,164
Johnny: Yeah, well, not
this one. Not this one.

301
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:06,000
David: Yeah, you know what?
I... I think I need to go.

302
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:08,234
Johnny: I think you need to eat
something and that will help.

303
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:10,370
No, I think I need to go back.

304
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:11,972
Moira: (Quietly) Take me with you please.

305
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:13,306
Johnny: David, sit down.
Sit down. Sit back down.

306
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:14,341
<i>David: Jocelyn, thank
you so much for dinner.</i>

307
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,176
Roland: Why don't you
lay down on our mattress.

308
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,345
The sheets are in the dryer
but there is rubber pad.

309
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:21,348
- No. Thanks.
- Johnny: David! Don't go near the door.

310
00:13:21,382 --> 00:13:22,583
- David! Do not open that door.
- (Door slams shut)

311
00:13:28,422 --> 00:13:30,423
I brought vodka as a house gift.

312
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,758
I don't see it.

313
00:13:32,793 --> 00:13:35,828
(Rock music plays, low
hum of party chatter)

314
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:41,467
(Engine roars)

315
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:49,675
Alexis: That's what I say. (Laughs) Great.

316
00:13:56,316 --> 00:14:01,249
- I'm Twyla from the cafe.
- Yeah.

317
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:03,922
David: Yeah. Davis Rose.

318
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:06,358
- Twyla: I'm a little drunk.
- David: Hm-hmm.

319
00:14:06,393 --> 00:14:10,062
- Stevie: Hey.
-Twyla: Hey Stevie.

320
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:13,298
Twyla: I am going to
roast myself a marshmallow.

321
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,567
- Anybody?
- Stevie: No. Thanks.

322
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:16,701
- Twyla: You're all good?
- David: No.

323
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:20,505
Twyla: Great.

324
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,206
Stevie: I don't know why you
were so reluctant to show up here.

325
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:25,209
You fit right in.

326
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:26,945
David: Well, my sister texted me "help".

327
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:28,346
And my mind went straight to deliverance.

328
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,149
So I wasn't too far off.

329
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:32,983
<i>Stevie: That's funny because your
sister texted me from across the bonfire</i>

330
00:14:33,018 --> 00:14:35,119
and said you'd probably show up here

331
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:36,754
because you were bored and lonely

332
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:39,057
and had nothing better to do.

333
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:40,658
David: Well, my sister is a
broken shell of a human being.

334
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:41,892
That's where that's coming from so...

335
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:44,529
Stevie: Oh, okay.

336
00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:47,631
Oh. Well, she seems fine.

337
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,734
Are you serious? That's
so funny. That's so funny.

338
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:53,103
So I guess you're free to go.

339
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:02,145
David: I'm gonna need a stiff
drink to get through this. Stiff.

340
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,114
(Smacking lips loudly)

341
00:15:08,018 --> 00:15:12,355
Moira: So Jocelyn, you were
saying that you teach high school,

342
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,357
or you want to finish high school?

343
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:17,427
I'm not sure, I couldn't hear
over your husband's chewing.

344
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:19,262
I teach high school.

345
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:21,564
Oh, you're a saint.

346
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:25,468
I love it. I love connecting
with the young people.

347
00:15:25,502 --> 00:15:27,603
Although I know those boys
are undressing me every time

348
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:29,871
I drop a piece of chalk.

349
00:15:29,906 --> 00:15:32,173
Yeah. Well, maybe we should
hold onto our chalk, hmm?

350
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,942
Jocelyn: They're boys! It's cute.

351
00:15:33,977 --> 00:15:36,244
Moira: (Quietly) John...

352
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:39,314
Roland: Oh, there it is! There it is!

353
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:42,417
- The Vivien Blake bitch face!
- Moira: Excuse me?

354
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:44,051
Roland: I didn't want to say anything,

355
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:48,223
but you were my favourite
character on "Sunrise Bay".

356
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:49,857
- Moira: Thanks.
- Jocelyn: It's true.

357
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:53,060
He lived for "Sunrise Bay".

358
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:55,463
I could be doing cartwheels in a thong

359
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:58,566
in front of that television,
which I have done,

360
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:02,169
but if your show was on, I
was as good as wall paper.

361
00:16:02,203 --> 00:16:04,038
Roland: Hey, how many people
did you slap on that show?

362
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:06,007
Moira: I don't care.

363
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,142
Johnny: She can't remember,
there were so many slaps.

364
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,744
Moira: Enough about me.

365
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:14,548
Let's talk about you signing this contract.

366
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:17,217
Roland: Well, somebody is
in a little hurry, ain't she?

367
00:16:17,252 --> 00:16:19,453
Johnny: No, no. We're not in a hurry. No.

368
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:21,140
- Moira: Aren't we?
- Johnny: No. We're not. No.

369
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:25,425
- Moira: Really?
- Roland: There it is again! Bam!

370
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,094
- Okay, I'll tell you what, Vivien...
- Moira: Moira.

371
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:30,564
Roland: I will go ahead
and sign off on the sale...

372
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:33,033
-  Moira: Good.
- Roland: ... For a slap.

373
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:39,205
Excuse me?

374
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,607
Roland: I've always wanted
to be slapped by Vivien Blake.

375
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:44,110
Jocelyn: It's true. We've
role-played it like a thousand times,

376
00:16:44,145 --> 00:16:46,512
- but it's not the real thing.
- Roland: Hm-hm.

377
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,981
Moira: You'd like me to slap you?

378
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:50,716
- Roland: Yeah.
- Moira: I don't think...

379
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,018
Roland: Well, don't
think. Just do it. Slap me.

380
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,920
- Johnny: He wants you to slap him.
- Moira: I won't.

381
00:16:54,954 --> 00:16:56,121
- Jocelyn: Slap him, Moira.
- Johnny: Go ahead and slap him.

382
00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:58,157
Jocelyn: Slap my husband, Moira.

383
00:16:58,192 --> 00:16:59,659
- Moira: John, I won't!
- Johnny: Slap him or I'll slap him.

384
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:01,627
- Roland: Slap me!
- Moira: I won't.

385
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:03,896
- Roland: Slap me like a bitch!
- Moira: Sign the fucking contract!

386
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,397
(Elated breaths)

387
00:17:12,138 --> 00:17:15,174
(Alexis laughs) Okay.

388
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,510
Um... this has been a lot of fun,

389
00:17:18,544 --> 00:17:21,213
but I'm starting to smell a
little too much like uh, campfire,

390
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:23,448
and denim and plaid and stuff so... bye.

391
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:28,620
Stevie: Your choices are beer or beer.

392
00:17:28,654 --> 00:17:31,556
David: I assume a pint
glass is out of the question?

393
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:33,225
Alexis: You came! How was dinner?

394
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:34,926
David: Um... worse than this?

395
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,428
Although at this point it's
sort of a moving target.

396
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:37,962
Stevie: Here hold this.

397
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:39,964
So there are no guys for me here.

398
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:42,066
But it was kind of nice to just
like to flex the old muscle.

399
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:44,001
Stevie: Put your thumb over the tube.

400
00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:47,705
Agh, I kind of wanna just go for it but...

401
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,008
- But sometimes it doesn't work out, I guess.
- David: Yeah.

402
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:53,310
- Stevie: Okay, put the tube in your mouth.
- David: What? Uh...

403
00:17:53,345 --> 00:17:55,346
- Yeah. Just open your throat.
- David: Oh.

404
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,281
Stevie: And go down, 'cause you're tall.

405
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:59,550
Alexis: Okay. David, how long
are you gonna be doing this?

406
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:02,953
Okay, just come and get
me after you vomit, okay?

407
00:18:02,987 --> 00:18:04,187
<i>Stevie: Just widen your throat!</i>

408
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:09,926
You!

409
00:18:12,997 --> 00:18:16,399
- Stevie: Chug!
- Crowd: Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

410
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:19,602
Crowd: Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

411
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:30,146
Crowd: Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

412
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,614
Alexis: Are you ready?

413
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:35,951
(Cheering, laughing)

414
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:44,026
(Humming)

415
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,904
And that's the last one there! Done!

416
00:18:54,938 --> 00:18:56,505
(Claps)

417
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:59,074
Ronald: Already.

418
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:01,576
There you go, Johnny, congratulations.

419
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:03,845
Thank you very much. Thank you.

420
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:06,515
Just remember one thing, okay?

421
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:10,285
This is my town and you're
gonna play by my rules.

422
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,189
Comprende?

423
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:17,091
(Laughs) I'm just messing with you, man!

424
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:19,694
- Come on!
- (Johnny laughs uneasily)

425
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:23,464
- Johnny: Wow.
- Roland: Or am I?

426
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:26,500
(Laughs) No. I am.

427
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:29,237
- Johnny: Moira! Shall we?
- Moira: Yeah.

428
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:31,372
Moira: Jocelyn, thank you
for an unforgettable evening,

429
00:19:31,406 --> 00:19:33,541
I will be dining out on this for years.

430
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:34,775
Jocelyn: I'll send you the recipes.

431
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,846
Yes, Jocelyn, words can't express.

432
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,716
<i>Roland: Seriously, Johnny,
good luck selling the town.</i>

433
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,918
- You sure gonna need it.
- Johnny: Why's that?

434
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:46,954
Roland: Well, it took a
while to sell the first time.

435
00:19:46,988 --> 00:19:49,824
I mean, it was on the
market for like what 20 years

436
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:51,758
before you bought it.

437
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:54,294
Johnny: 20 years?

438
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:55,595
Roland: Yeah. I mean, most people
just thought it was a waste of money

439
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,264
that it would never sell, you know?

440
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:58,966
Who in their right mind would buy it!

441
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,567
(Laughs) Then along came you.

442
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:04,471
(Anxious sigh)

443
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:12,954
Moira: John! Did you know this
town was on the market for 20 years

444
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:14,040
before we bought it?

445
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,263
How would I know that?
W... why would I know that?

446
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:18,499
I didn't know that.

447
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:21,402
But look, let's look at the bright side...

448
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:23,103
Moira: There is no bright side.

449
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,472
This is the dark side of the moon, Johnny.

450
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:28,910
And we'll be here another 20 years,
tucked in a crater, lost to all.

451
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:30,444
Johnny well, you know what?

452
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:32,446
I think that's being a little dramatic.

453
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,948
Moira: Yes! It's dramatic! (Slams door)

454
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:39,019
Sweetheart! We got the thing signed, okay?!

455
00:20:39,054 --> 00:20:40,854
And if we have to fix this
town up before we sell it,

456
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:42,622
then we fix it up.

457
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:44,958
We fix it up, bit by bit.

458
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:46,726
And it's gonna take hard

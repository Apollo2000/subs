1
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:13,428
- No, no, no! No, no, no!

2
00:00:13,478 --> 00:00:15,879
- No! Noooo!
- What?

3
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:18,248
- My bag! It's gone!
- What bag?

4
00:00:18,283 --> 00:00:20,851
- My brown bag!
- What brown bag?

5
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:22,219
You had a room full of
brown bags back home,

6
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:23,887
which brown bag?!

7
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:26,623
My crocodile bag, the
one my mother gave me!

8
00:00:26,658 --> 00:00:29,259
Oh, it's in the closet,
next to my briefcase.

9
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:32,195
That's an ostrich bag.

10
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:36,928
Okay, just calm down, breathe, breathe.

11
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,835
Breathe... breathe!

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,109
Okay... David!

13
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:45,142
David must've taken it, along
with my last molecule of hope!

14
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:48,011
Oh Moira, David only took his own bags.

15
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:50,042
Are you kidding?! I bet
he's pawned it by now,

16
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:51,615
to pay for manicures.

17
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,016
What possible sense would it make for David

18
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:54,351
to take one of your bags?

19
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:56,853
It doesn't... oh towels, great.

20
00:00:56,888 --> 00:00:59,122
Mrs. Rose, you got out of bed.

21
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:00,505
Humph!

22
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:03,583
Sorry, am I interrupting something?

23
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:05,395
No, no, we're just, we're looking for

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,130
something valuable, and um...

25
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:09,496
- Your son?
- Well, no,

26
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:10,855
a brown bag, as a matter of fact.

27
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:13,786
Well... our son, yes.

28
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:15,958
Has anyone heard from David?

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,874
Oh, to be so naive!

30
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,409
He's long gone, darling,

31
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:21,778
escaped, and left us all behind.

32
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:23,680
Okay, well uh...

33
00:01:23,714 --> 00:01:25,649
I've put in some calls to some people,

34
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:28,084
just to get the word out.

35
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:29,528
Well, that's very nice.

36
00:01:29,553 --> 00:01:32,333
That's, very nice Stevie,
thank you very much.

37
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,263
That's, very considerate,

38
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:36,856
because I know you and David had a...

39
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:39,200
Intimate uh, relationship.

40
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,933
Okay, I just came to drop off the towels,

41
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,097
and check in, so.

42
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:44,536
Is that Stevie?

43
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:47,624
Can you ask her if she
has any extra bedspreads?

44
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,903
I'm still here!

45
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:53,347
Oh! Okay, then come
here then, please, for a sec?

46
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,460
Yeah, um, come in.

47
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,927
Hey, does this place have
any king sized sheets?

48
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:11,487
Alexis, what the hell are you doing?!

49
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:14,044
Just giving myself some more space.

50
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,004
There's a lot going on
in my life right now.

51
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:19,374
Like, Ted keeps harassing me for an answer

52
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,880
to the whole, am I gonna marry him thing,

53
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:24,182
and then there's the whole Mutt issue,

54
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:26,642
which is very complicated, and sexy,

55
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,568
so I'm just, I don't know what to do.

56
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:30,561
I take it you haven't heard from David.

57
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:32,835
Okay, yeah, fine.

58
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,364
And David's missing. So...

59
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:41,023
 -- Synced by the_foe --
-- (dla Boby) --

60
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:44,021
yeah, well, he's missing.

61
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:48,841
Well, I can't find him, so
what would you say he is?

62
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:51,884
Okay, you know what? You know what?!

63
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:53,218
I don't think your mother
would appreciate you

64
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:55,254
speaking to me in that way!

65
00:02:57,805 --> 00:03:00,521
Well, I'm-I'm sorry for your loss.

66
00:03:02,362 --> 00:03:04,544
Oh! What'd they say!

67
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,970
Nothing, and I'm getting nervous, Moira.

68
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:08,622
Don't worry, he's fine.

69
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:10,567
It's not the first time David's run away,

70
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:12,426
remember all those troubled
years in high school,

71
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:15,107
when he'd charter the
jet without permission?

72
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:16,909
Yes, but he has no money.

73
00:03:16,943 --> 00:03:18,543
Oh, he does now.

74
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:19,978
If there's one thing David knows,

75
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:22,442
it's the street value of a woman's bag.

76
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:24,168
Okay, you know what, can we
stop talking about that bag

77
00:03:24,193 --> 00:03:27,195
for five minutes, the
bag, the bag, and the bag!

78
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,864
John, it's an heirloom, my
great grandmother took it

79
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:31,661
from her husband when she left him,

80
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:34,371
and it has been passed
down through all the women

81
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:37,038
in my family, as emergency currency,

82
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:38,163
in case we need to leave our husbands

83
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:39,231
in the middle of the night.

84
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:41,700
Oh, well, that's reassuring.

85
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:43,003
You don't have to worry darling,

86
00:03:43,028 --> 00:03:44,202
I'll never need it.

87
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:45,904
But you know Alexis will!

88
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,739
Yeah, more than once, probably.

89
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:49,372
I love that bag.

90
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,511
And I've kept it safe all these years.

91
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:54,813
And now John, it's out there,

92
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:56,748
- frightened, and alone...
- Okay, okay.

93
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:59,451
We'll find it, we'll find your bag.

94
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:01,687
- We'll find your bag, Moira.
- Oh, we better, please!

95
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:02,721
- Yes, we will.
- Please!

96
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:21,006
Hey, uh, I really shouldn't come in.

97
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,274
Actually, you're standing
in my living room,

98
00:04:22,308 --> 00:04:24,710
- you let yourself in.
- Yeah, no, I know.

99
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:27,112
Um, so, about the other night...

100
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:29,614
- Uh huh.
- Oh! Mm!

101
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,851
That night. Um... that was super fun.

102
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:33,885
I'd say it was the most fun I had all year.

103
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,614
Yeah, it was super fun.

104
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,322
Actually, I wouldn't mind
having a little more fun,

105
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:39,725
- right now.
- Okay...

106
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,327
And I love hearing you say that.

107
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:44,529
It's just that, when we got together,

108
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:46,999
um, I thought my family was leaving.

109
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:50,747
- Uh huh.
- And now we're not. So...

110
00:04:50,818 --> 00:04:52,285
I would love to feel
worse about your parents

111
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,954
not selling the town, but...

112
00:04:53,988 --> 00:04:56,074
Hmm, it's just, it's so tragic,

113
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:58,872
'cause my mom is in this like, waking coma,

114
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:00,664
and my dad has developed more of a stutter,

115
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:04,231
and uh, because we're not leaving,

116
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:08,505
things are a little bit
complicated with Ted.

117
00:05:10,705 --> 00:05:12,880
I thought things were done with Ted.

118
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:13,981
Me too.

119
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:17,477
But apparently, he was misinformed.

120
00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:20,841
- By who?
- By me.

121
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:23,617
Okay.

122
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:26,119
Until that whole thing
kinda works itself out,

123
00:05:26,154 --> 00:05:28,646
I have a moral obligation to Ted.

124
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:31,458
You hands are so...

125
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,404
Soft for someone who does
nothing but manual labor.

126
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:35,829
Thanks, I make sure to moisturize.

127
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:38,521
Mm, that's so important. So important.

128
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:46,630
Listen... I can wait.

129
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:48,508
Thank you.

130
00:05:48,543 --> 00:05:51,403
- Uh huh.
- So um...

131
00:05:52,046 --> 00:05:53,814
So, you look really good today.

132
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:08,695
Oh, hello, Roses.

133
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,792
What, are you here to tell
me Alexis has skipped town

134
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:11,880
with my lawn mower?!

135
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,367
Roland, these people have
literally hit rock bottom,

136
00:06:14,402 --> 00:06:16,669
they're not in the mood
for your jokes right now.

137
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:18,333
She is.

138
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,559
Look, I've been on the phone all morning

139
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:22,117
with missing persons, and just wondering

140
00:06:22,152 --> 00:06:23,686
if you've heard anything?

141
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,192
No. Come in, come on in.

142
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:31,239
I can't imagine the
stress of losing a child.

143
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:34,066
Oh, I haven't lost him, i
know exactly where he is.

144
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,364
He's enjoying happy hour
at the viceroy without me.

145
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:39,507
It's been three days without any contact.

146
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,394
Johnny, you wouldn't know this,

147
00:06:41,545 --> 00:06:44,814
but statistics tell us
you have a 48 hour window

148
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,974
before you can assume somebody is dead.

149
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:49,974
Yeah, I just said it's been three days.

150
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,016
Then do we call off the search?

151
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,417
Oh my God!

152
00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:56,856
I'll get it.

153
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:00,794
Roland Schitt.

154
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:03,481
Yes.

155
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:05,599
Yes!

156
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,530
Yes!

157
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:10,766
Oh-oh. Okay.

158
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,591
Uh-huh, yeah.

159
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,084
I'm good, how about you?

160
00:07:16,204 --> 00:07:18,856
Terrific. Great, where?

161
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:22,286
Uh-huh.
Uhhhh-huh!

162
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,656
I got it, great, we'll see
you there this afternoon.

163
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:27,560
Bye. Well, good news, folks!

164
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:28,888
They found the truck.

165
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,302
And David.

166
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:35,763
- Well, that didn't come up.
- Well, didn't you ask?

167
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,981
Johnny, they were all
excited about telling me

168
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:39,286
they found the truck, so...

169
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:40,803
- Call him back!
- Call him back. Now!

170
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:41,630
Call him back!

171
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:43,004
Well, I

172
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,700
I don't have the number,
I've got the address.

173
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,435
I'm sure David is with
the truck, right, Roland?

174
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:51,083
Well, I think they would've told me if
there's a dead body with the truck, honey.

175
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:54,208
- Oh!
- Just give us the address!

176
00:07:55,454 --> 00:07:56,854
Give me the address!

177
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:01,372
- Did they mention bags?
- Well, no talk of bags.

178
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,637
Were there bags in the truck?

179
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:08,232
My best friend in kindergarten ran away,

180
00:08:08,257 --> 00:08:10,049
and her parents didn't notice,

181
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,860
and she ended up getting
adopted by this really rich

182
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:13,333
Asian family in Vancouver,

183
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:14,896
but then they had their own kid,

184
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,464
so she kind of got neglected a bit,

185
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:17,565
and I can't remember whether she's back

186
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,933
on the streets now, or...

187
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:20,535
You know, and he took
his hair straightener,

188
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:23,104
which he knows that i
use more than he does.

189
00:08:23,138 --> 00:08:25,239
This whole thing is just very selfish.

190
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:26,502
Alexis!

191
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:30,790
Ted! Oh my God, hi.

192
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:32,627
- Hey.
- Hey.

193
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,877
Um... I've been calling.

194
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:38,852
I know, I know. But
everything's just been so hectic,

195
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:41,595
what with David missing,

196
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,433
and like, I haven't been sleeping,

197
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,813
and I haven't been eating, and...

198
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:46,111
You just ordered the parfait.

199
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:48,947
And I just keep picturing
him at the bottom of a lake.

200
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:51,875
Oh, no, that guy was
like, a known alcoholic,

201
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,744
and they pulled him out a week ago.

202
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:56,088
Thank God you're here!

203
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:58,628
Of course, I've been trying
to be here more for you,

204
00:08:58,653 --> 00:09:02,446
but I guess my texts
haven't been getting through,

205
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:04,238
or maybe I'm sending them wrong?

206
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,455
That's so sweet.

207
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,158
Uh, here.

208
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:11,962
Listen.

209
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:17,930
I don't want to apply any pressure

210
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:19,529
to the whole marriage thing, but...

211
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,209
Thank you, Ted, 'cause
it's so hard to focus

212
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:23,010
on something like that right now.

213
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:24,783
And I totally understand that.

214
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:27,857
It's just... you had said that you wanted

215
00:09:27,882 --> 00:09:30,717
to get married if you weren't leaving town,

216
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:33,685
and you didn't leave town, so...

217
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,487
Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm.

218
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:37,563
And I totally get that.

219
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:41,385
Technically though, someone did leave,

220
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,385
and so the dust just hasn't really settled

221
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,886
on the whole... us leaving thing.

222
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:48,463
- Yet.
- Right.

223
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,181
But obviously I want to be with you!

224
00:09:52,995 --> 00:09:55,062
I'm just so scared.

225
00:09:58,463 --> 00:09:59,934
What, about David, or about being with...

226
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:02,017
Yeah, that.

227
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:07,748
All we know is the truck ran
out of gas on an amish farm.

228
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:11,633
So David has been living on
an amish farm for three days?

229
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:13,072
We think so.

230
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:15,264
I really hope you're right.

231
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:17,730
Stevie dear,

232
00:10:17,755 --> 00:10:19,022
now don't take this the wrong way,

233
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:21,248
but, is this car your home?

234
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:22,408
Excuse me?

235
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:26,785
I take it you're finished
with this sandwich.

236
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:29,306
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

237
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:32,766
Oh yeah! Um, but there's
donuts under the seat,

238
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,111
those are still good.

239
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:36,510
Oh.

240
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,106
Okay.

241
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:44,216
Alexis, we think we found your brother!

242
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:45,642
Come on!

243
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,768
I'm just super tired from walking, though.

244
00:10:54,597 --> 00:10:57,510
Babe, you're tired because
you were stressed about David,

245
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,560
but they found him, you should go.

246
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:01,978
Alexis!

247
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:04,465
I know!

248
00:11:15,077 --> 00:11:17,111
This is exactly what David wants.

249
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:18,646
All of us worried, and driving around

250
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,147
in some tin can looking for him.

251
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:22,650
It's a tactic. It's subterfuge.

252
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:25,019
Oh, you could be jumping
to conclusions, Moira.

253
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:27,021
I taught him everything he knows.

254
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:27,888
He shouldn't have left me behind,

255
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:29,657
that was never part of the plan.

256
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:31,559
Oh my God, ever since David left,

257
00:11:31,593 --> 00:11:33,596
you two have been so dramatic.

258
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:35,696
Do I have to remind you of the time

259
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:37,832
that I was taken hostage
on David geffen's yacht

260
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:39,834
by Somali pirates for a week,

261
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:42,064
and nobody answered my texts?!

262
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:44,305
I had just had my eyelashes dyed,

263
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,549
everything was cloudy!

264
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:48,463
Okay, can we all focus here? For a moment?!

265
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:52,397
David has spent the last
three days on a farm.

266
00:11:52,774 --> 00:11:54,542
With the amish!

267
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:16,203
Ugh!

268
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:26,520
Oh!

269
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,484
Thank God.

270
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,186
David!

271
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,760
David!

272
00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:36,463
David, I'm here!

273
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:37,655
David, it's us!

274
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:40,838
I know!

275
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,562
David, come here, please!

276
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:46,222
Stop yelling, "David!" You come here!

277
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:48,148
We've come to take you home!

278
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:49,810
Three days later!

279
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,602
Nobody knew where you were!

280
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,607
And your phone was off!

281
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:55,822
I texted Alexis!

282
00:12:57,596 --> 00:12:59,847
Wha? I'm sorry for not responding to like,

283
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:02,205
one text, David!

284
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:07,572
I was worried sick, dear!
"Where's David, or his bags?"

285
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:09,818
- David?
- What?!

286
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:12,962
- Okay, you remember Mutt?
- Yeah!

287
00:13:12,987 --> 00:13:15,055
Okay, it's gotten more complicated!

288
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:16,737
What happened?

289
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:19,510
- We slept together!
- Ooh...

290
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:23,782
Okay Alexis, we can talk
about this on the ride home.

291
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:27,097
David, let us help you with your bags!

292
00:13:27,122 --> 00:13:29,439
What if I'm not ready to come home?!

293
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:32,314
- There's a bug on your dress.
- Ew!

294
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:33,881
Ugh! Oh!

295
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:42,497
Miriam makes the most delicious butter.

296
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:46,001
Yeah, I mean, she starts
pounding that cream

297
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,027
about a half hour too early in the morning,

298
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,096
but it tastes exactly
like the butter we had

299
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,697
at the Ritz in Paris,
you know, that sort of...

300
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:53,846
Salt-less butter.

301
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:57,212
Well, once again, thank
you for nurturing our David

302
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,416
during such a difficult time.

303
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:02,710
Well, we should be thanking you for coming.

304
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:04,662
We've spent two sleepless nights,

305
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:06,221
wondering what would happen if nobody came.

306
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,181
Would we be stuck with him?!

307
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,835
Oh, my baby! Thank you, thank you!

308
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,795
I would give you a gratuity, but...

309
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,869
I'm short about a million this week.

310
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,329
David's stay here has taught
us some valuable lessons

311
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:25,135
- in patience, forgiveness...
- Restraint.

312
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:30,421
Well it seems you've taken very
good care of our possessions,

313
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:33,291
I hope it wasn't too much of an imposition.

314
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:36,802
You know, I'm not sure I'm
even ready to come home yet.

315
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:40,602
And yet your time with
us has come to an end.

316
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:41,916
Okay.

317
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:44,001
These three days you spent with us David,

318
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:46,094
will remain in our memories for many days,

319
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,830
and many, many, many nights.

320
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:50,892
Thank you for your kindness,

321
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:53,916
when no one else showed me kindness.

322
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:56,229
And compassion, when no one else showed...

323
00:14:56,254 --> 00:14:58,205
Excuse me son, uh...

324
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,977
I imagine it's customary
for strangers to partake

325
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,370
in a good, old fashioned amish lunch?

326
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:05,532
Not always.

327
00:15:06,202 --> 00:15:07,267
Have a safe trip.

328
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:10,810
Oh! Okay.

329
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:13,838
Thank you. Thanks.

330
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:16,606
Yeah, thank-thank you.

331
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,633
Where are we?

332
00:15:25,072 --> 00:15:28,074
Do you know how many times
I've had to apologize to Roland?

333
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:31,066
You can't just leave with
other people's trucks, David!

334
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:32,497
What were you thinking?

335
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:37,778
What you did was impulsive,
capricious and melodramatic.

336
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:39,361
But it was also wrong.

337
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:42,408
Okay, nobody freaked out
when Alexis went missing!

338
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:44,685
I didn't go missing, David.

339
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,012
The FBI knew where I was the entire time.

340
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,346
All right listen, the important thing is,

341
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,838
we have David back,

342
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:53,399
we have your bag back, and
here we are, all together.

343
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:55,189
What bag?

344
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,290
You stole my bag, David.

345
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,705
That bag?

346
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,672
That bag looks like it hasn't
been used in a hundred years,

347
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:03,674
so I put my toiletries in it.

348
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,948
Why would you think that
i would steal that bag?

349
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:08,760
I don't know David, why
did you steal my eyeliner?

350
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:11,385
That was a phase in high school!

351
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,143
Now, did you come for me,
or did you come for that bag?

352
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:17,721
- This was my grandmother's bag!
- We came for you!

353
00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:20,916
I hitchhiked, in the middle of the night,

354
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,955
wearing all black!

355
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,417
I was basically asking to get hit by a car!

356
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,814
Why?

357
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:29,633
You told me that Diane
Sawyer gave you that bag,

358
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:30,728
and that it was fake.

359
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:32,408
I didn't want you taking it.

360
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:34,869
Okay, because I have told a lot of people

361
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,041
that Diane Sawyer sells
fake bags on the down-low.

362
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:42,049
I slept in the cab of a truck! Overnight!

363
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,416
Oh my God, who hasn't, David!

364
00:17:11,793 --> 00:17:13,060
Hmm.

365
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:18,949
- Hi.
- What can I...

366
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:20,207
- How are-yeah.
- What?

367
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:23,283
Um... I come bearing gifts.

368
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:25,903
Oh, how generous of you.

369
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,760
I think your car might
need a bit of a clean.

370
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:33,291
Is that a dead squirrel on your hood?

371
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,514
They said that you have
been calling around,

372
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:40,635
asking for me, which i
thought was very nice of you.

373
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,557
Oh, well, I didn't.

374
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:45,470
Hmm, well, they said that you were.

375
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:47,464
Well, they were mistaken.

376
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,877
Oh, okay.

377
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,775
In fact, I was hoping
you wouldn't come back.

378
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:55,883
Wow, believe it or not,
that is one of the warmest

379
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,299
welcomes I have received so far!

380
00:17:58,586 --> 00:17:59,826
Usually when you tell someone

381
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:01,924
that you have feelings for them,

382
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:04,508
and the next thing they
do is drive out of town

383
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,072
with no plan to return,

384
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,798
you hope you never have to see them again.

385
00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:12,721
Well, in my defense, um...

386
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:15,785
I was intending on staying
away for much longer,

387
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,361
but I ran out of money,
and forgot my phone charger.

388
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:21,932
Oh, well, at least you
were well intentioned.

389
00:18:23,621 --> 00:18:26,122
It's not like I didn't
think about what you said.

390
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,940
Um, after we spoke,

391
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,002
I thought, well, there goes my one friend.

392
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,291
Try saying that one out
loud, it is very dark.

393
00:18:40,864 --> 00:18:42,252
Well...

394
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:46,371
We will just have to work
through this, won't we?

395
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,661
Uh-huh. Yes.

396
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,696
Yeah, um, if that's what you-

397
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,265
if that's what you want, then yes,

398
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,866
I would like that very much.

399
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,002
So um, I guess just tell me

400
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,137
what you would like me to do,

401
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,752
and I will do it.

402
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:03,650
Okay, well, let's start
by you leaving my office,

403
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,127
and we'll see where that takes us.

404
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:08,831
Mm-hmm. Well, I'll just...

405
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,393
I'm gonna leave your office.

406
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:12,791
I'm gonna leave your
- I'm gonna leave your office.

407
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:14,083
So um...

408
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,399
Best wishes to you.

409
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,677
Warmest regards.

410
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:33,106
Okay, you're saying
this was circulated around town?

411
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,498
This was before my nose job,

412
00:19:34,532 --> 00:19:36,500
how was anyone supposed to recognize me?

413
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:39,236
Oh David, it's a rare gift
to strip vanity of its charm,

414
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:40,571
- yet here you are.
- Yeah!

415
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:42,239
Oh, fuhhh...

416
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:44,255
Hello, Roses!

417
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,682
Oh, can this not wait 'til
after breakfast, please?

418
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:48,408
Well, this will only take a second.

419
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:50,036
David!

420
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,355
I'm so glad to see you back
home, all safe and sound.

421
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:55,372
Thanks.

422
00:19:55,397 --> 00:19:57,021
Hmm. And I don't want you to worry,

423
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,146
I'm not gonna press charges, okay?

424
00:20:00,974 --> 00:20:02,141
Next time, someone will think twice

425
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,310
before they steal my truck, yes?

426
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:06,764
Ooh, burn, David!

427
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:08,299
Shhh!

428
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,997
David, don't you um,

429
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,152
have anything you wanna say to Roland?

430
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,224
Uh... !

431
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:22,259
Uh, I'm sorry for taking
your truck without permission.

432
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:35,032
Um...

433
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:38,494
It was a bad mistake,

434
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:41,009
and it won't happen again.

435
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:50,931
Oh my God, um...

436
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:53,595
And I feel really bad about it.

437
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:55,126
But do you, David?

438
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:57,632
All right, all right, all right,

439
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,384
I accept your apology.

440
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:01,919
Thank you.

441
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:03,854
- Yeah!
- Okay, now let's talk about gas.

442
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,134
I'm thinking thirty cents on the mile.

443
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:07,260
I think we're done here, Roland!

444
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:16,757
- Okay... I'm taking your juice.
- David!

445
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:19,631

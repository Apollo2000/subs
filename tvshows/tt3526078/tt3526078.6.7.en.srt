1
00:00:01,172 --> 00:00:03,534
<i>Two balls and
two strikes on Hernandez.</i>

2
00:00:03,924 --> 00:00:05,583
<i>And there's a well-placed bunt!</i>

3
00:00:05,668 --> 00:00:07,298
Why did he hit the ball
like that?

4
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:10,811
So that is called a bunt.
It's uh, it's tactical.

5
00:00:10,896 --> 00:00:12,962
It allows the guy on first
to get over to second.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,213
Okay.
Who came up with the word "bunt"?

7
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:17,530
Sounds like something
you'd need to see a surgeon for.

8
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:20,299
David,
this is an important game.

9
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:21,533
You told me
you could get into this.

10
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:23,187
I was referring to
the pizza.

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,760
But, also, the game.

12
00:00:27,598 --> 00:00:29,806
What do we have
here?

13
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:32,126
I seem to have
stumbled into some sort

14
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:33,788
of gentlemen's cavern.

15
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:36,088
Hey, thanks for letting me
stay here tonight, Mrs. Rose,

16
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:37,693
When David told me
he wanted to install

17
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:39,273
a Japanese toilet
at my place,

18
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:41,166
he neglected to mention
that it would involve

19
00:00:41,252 --> 00:00:43,387
- taking out a wall.
- It was in the email.

20
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:44,594
Also, you will be
thanking me

21
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:47,372
when you experience the heated,
motion-sensor toilet seat.

22
00:00:47,457 --> 00:00:50,099
So, David, I take
it you'll be employed as cheerleader

23
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:52,887
for whatever
televised sporting event

24
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:55,120
is unfolding
for the remainder of the day?

25
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:58,994
Alas, this is Patrick's day.
We're doing what Patrick wants.

26
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,964
- Yes!
- Wow,

27
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:02,826
someone's enjoying their day!

28
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,388
Sorry.
Just... cleared the bases.

29
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:09,492
It turns out Herb Ertlinger,
the great fruit vintner,

30
00:01:09,577 --> 00:01:11,853
is rabid fan of the Crows
movie -

31
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:13,362
good luck finding someone
who isn't -

32
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:17,019
and he would like to
name a wine after me.

33
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:18,700
- Oh my...
- They should call it a...

34
00:01:18,785 --> 00:01:20,634
a Moira Rosé.

35
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:22,654
Yes, that's what he has
in mind.

36
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:26,685
Amazing!
Congrats, Mrs. Rose!

37
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,886
- Mm.
- What news!

38
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,679
Yes, but he wants me
to sample

39
00:01:30,763 --> 00:01:33,234
the fruits of his labor
this very day!

40
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,139
Well, this seems like a very
important moment in your life.

41
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:39,254
I only wish
I could be there.

42
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:40,692
I can't go alone.

43
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:42,677
Well, unfortunately,

44
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:44,569
I told my fiancé I'd
watch the game

45
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:46,254
- with him... okay.
- Just go, David.

46
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:51,514
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

47
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:53,847
You guys might wanna rehearse
a little more next time.

48
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:55,999
The extraction did feel
a bit strained.

49
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,004
- That was you.
- Wha?

50
00:02:01,332 --> 00:02:02,601
Love you.

51
00:02:03,976 --> 00:02:05,570
<i>And a sigh of relief</i>

52
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:06,959
<i>for the beleaguered bullpen...</i>

55
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,197
There are my fierce women,

56
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:22,947
ready to elevate their lives!

57
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:24,974
I'm so glad you decided
to come today.

58
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,167
Well, you pushed pretty
hard for it, Alexis.

59
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:28,959
- You said you'd buy me lunch.
- Mhmm.

60
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:31,708
As Elevation's official
regional brand ambassador

61
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,759
and regional marketing
invigorator,

62
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:35,141
<i>I need to ask you guys:</i>

63
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:37,158
are you ready for
a total physical

64
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:39,220
and emotional
transformation?

65
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:42,622
- Nah, but I'll do your class.
- Mm.

66
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:44,055
I didn't know they'd make us
change

67
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:45,733
out of our own workout clothes.

68
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:47,392
Yeah, I kinda wish
I knew that

69
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:49,923
before I spent all that money
on my Lulu Limes.

70
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:52,716
- Okay.
- I found a stain on my pants.

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,285
Are we sure that
they clean these?

72
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,121
- 'Kay, Stevie...
- Alexis!

73
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:58,148
It's wonderful to see
all these new recruits

74
00:02:58,232 --> 00:02:59,581
you've brought for us
today.

75
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:02,182
Leadership is thrilled with
all of your hard work.

76
00:03:02,323 --> 00:03:03,973
Oh my God, I'm blushing.

77
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,902
Um, ladies, meet Citrus.

78
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,439
Citrus runs our
East Coast wing,

79
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:11,415
so we are very lucky
to have him here today.

80
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,901
You know,
I should also tell you

81
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:15,483
that he's been very impressed
with all of the work

82
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:17,074
you've done for us
these past few weeks.

83
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:19,130
I'm sorry, who's "he?"

84
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:21,511
Oh, good point.
Who's "he"?

85
00:03:21,843 --> 00:03:24,083
Well, if you keep this up,
you'll find out soon enough.

86
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,551
Twyla, Stevie, Jocelyn,
and Ronnie,

87
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:30,449
have a great class.

88
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:33,676
How does he know all
of our names?

89
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,637
Am I crazy or is he really
cute?

90
00:03:36,722 --> 00:03:38,919
Okay, ladies,
are we ready to elevate?

91
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:40,953
- Nah.
- What if I just wait in the car

92
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:42,488
until you're ready for lunch?
'Cause I'm just getting

93
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,035
a really weird vibe
from this place.

94
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,862
Stevie, we've talked
about this.

95
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:48,194
You are a businesswoman now
and part of that means

96
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:50,456
that you need to be like
physically and mentally sharp.

97
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,268
And also, I get paid for
everyone that signs up,

98
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:53,965
so mm, mm, mm.

99
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:59,592
All right, my Elevators,

100
00:03:59,924 --> 00:04:03,247
we are ascending,
not depending.

101
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:04,970
All our troubles,
all our worries,

102
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:08,180
we're going to elevate
above them.

103
00:04:08,324 --> 00:04:11,271
Can I get an 'oh yeah'
if you're up on my level!

104
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:13,115
Oh yeah!

105
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,442
Oh yeah...

106
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:24,124
Hey, Johnny.

107
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:27,215
Listen, I don't wanna creep
you out or anything,

108
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:29,545
but I was just peering
into your son's bedroom...

109
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,467
Okay, not off to a good
start, Roland.

110
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:33,351
Well, do you know that
Patrick's sitting in there

111
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:35,775
- all by himself?
- Uh, yes, I'm aware.

112
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,322
He's spending the night
with us.

113
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:39,456
Patrick is practically family
now.

114
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,756
Ah.
Have you told him that?

115
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:45,776
Well, no, I haven't told him.

116
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:48,563
I mean, I haven't exactly
said it out loud.

117
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:50,368
Yeah... I don't know, Johnny.

118
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:52,552
Not having the big father/
son-in-law chat

119
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:55,342
feels like a missed opportunity
to lay down some laws.

120
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:59,030
Maybe Patrick should get
"the talk" from old Uncle Roland.

121
00:04:59,114 --> 00:05:01,498
'Kay, nobody's having a talk
with Uncle Roland.

122
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,317
Look, everything is fine.

123
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:06,253
If I feel like having a talk,
I'll have a talk.

124
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:07,665
Now, if you'll excuse me,

125
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,080
I have a few things
to attend to.

126
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:12,258
I remember when Jocelyn's dad
gave me the talk.

127
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:14,895
I mean, he was trying to talk
me out of getting married,

128
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,174
but she was 9 months pregnant
at the time,

129
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:19,168
so he really didn't have a leg
to stand on.

130
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,254
But I'll tell you,

131
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,269
I could not get out of that
sauna fast enough.

132
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,969
No way!

133
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,254
The kid's just in there
by himself, Johnny.

134
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:30,080
Something to think about.

135
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:36,897
Okay,
so how did this happen?

136
00:05:36,982 --> 00:05:38,697
I'm shocked he'd give you
a second chance

137
00:05:38,782 --> 00:05:40,429
after that train wreck
of a commercial.

138
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:42,557
Mark my words, David,
Herb...

139
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,066
- Ertlinger.
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:46,300
Won't be the last we see to
clamber out of the woodwork

141
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:48,564
now that I have a hit film
on my hands.

142
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:53,084
Spines tend to liquidate
in the presence of success.

143
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:54,880
Speaking of.

144
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:56,122
Herb!

145
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:57,628
ERT-linger.
ERT. LINGER.

146
00:05:57,713 --> 00:06:00,364
- Herb Ertlinger.
- Nailed it first try.

147
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:04,619
Hey, bygones be bygones
about the TV spot.

148
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:05,837
At least the print ad
worked out.

149
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:07,260
Pretty hard to mess up
one of those!

150
00:06:07,344 --> 00:06:09,006
Clearly you haven't seen
the heartburn ads

151
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:12,048
- she shot with Anne Geddes.
- Herb,

152
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:14,197
I would like
to introduce you

153
00:06:14,282 --> 00:06:16,819
to a potential vendor.
This is my son, David Rose.

154
00:06:16,904 --> 00:06:19,082
I'm sure you've heard of
Rose Apothecary?

155
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:20,745
I have not, no.

156
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,485
But I'd be happy to discuss
a buy with...

157
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,161
whatever store this is,

158
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:27,946
- if it means something to you.
- Okay.

159
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:30,081
I think we might need to sample
the product first.

160
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,341
Ah!

161
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:34,448
My wife and I got a real kick
out of that Crows movie.

162
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:39,041
So we would love to make
our Moira Rosé

163
00:06:39,342 --> 00:06:41,209
an exclusive
and limited release.

164
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:42,863
This is what we're thinking
for the label.

165
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,661
Well, hello!

166
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:47,541
Who is she and how do we get
a mouthful of her?!

167
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:49,705
Now, it's important that
you believe

168
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,045
in the product
you're selling,

169
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:52,699
so we have a few options:

170
00:06:52,783 --> 00:06:54,527
there's the strawberry-peach,

171
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,599
the ground fruits blend,

172
00:06:56,787 --> 00:07:01,548
and... a lovely banana rosé.
Huh?

173
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:04,689
- Mmm. Rich in potassium.
- Mm-hmm.

174
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:06,850
So, uh, sample at your
leisure.

175
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:08,653
I'll come back with some
coffee grounds

176
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:10,616
and a cheese board.

177
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:15,237
Again, we are so thrilled
to have you here, Moira.

178
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:18,376
- Enjoy.
- Thank you so much.

179
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:20,847
Poor thing.

180
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:24,862
Okay. Here is to being able
to share

181
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:26,815
the perks of the industry
with you.

182
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,928
Salut.

183
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:29,205
Cheers.

184
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:35,064
Oh, I had my reservations
about banana.

185
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,963
Um,
that's strawberry-peach.

186
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:39,473
Oh dear, it tastes like
Amoxicillin.

187
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:45,274
This one's burning my throat.
These are terrible!

188
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:47,051
Well, we have to pick one,
David.

189
00:07:47,136 --> 00:07:49,221
Do we? You really want people
associating your name

190
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:51,460
with this... laundry detergent?

191
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:53,195
I would never sell this
at my store.

192
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,802
Okay, enough.

193
00:07:57,108 --> 00:07:58,538
Whew.

194
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:01,028
Now I'm getting notes
of tomato.

195
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,167
Ugh.

196
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,523
<i>Bottom of
the 8th, Tigers down by one.</i>

197
00:08:06,832 --> 00:08:08,540
<i>Great pitching duel today...</i>

198
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:10,263
Oh, hey, Mr. Rose.

199
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,405
Patrick! Uh, yeah,
I was gonna say hello,

200
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,428
I, uh, didn't wanna interrupt.

201
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,552
No, no, not at all.
I'm just watching the game.

202
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:19,290
Hey, do you want some pizza?

203
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:22,249
Uh... yeah, I could go
for some 'za.

204
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:24,487
Ordered it a while ago,

205
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,966
so it might be a bit cold
by now, but...

206
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,453
Oh, that's okay,
cold pizza can be good.

207
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:30,960
- Mm.
- Hot pizza's good.

208
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:34,798
Too-hot pizza - not so good.

209
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,477
- I got that happening.
- Yeah.

210
00:08:36,562 --> 00:08:38,211
Oh, is this thin crust?

211
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:39,850
I think it's just regular.

212
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:42,502
Oh yeah, well, I love
a regular crust.

213
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:45,085
<i>..Jackson on
the mound.</i>

214
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,744
Yeah, cheese, tomato sauce,
bread.

215
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,077
Can't beat that combination.

216
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,063
<i>Here's the
wind-up - and the pitch!</i>

217
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:56,764
You know, speaking of great
combinations, you and David...

218
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:58,369
- Oh!
- Oh, uh...

219
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,146
did we get another hit?

220
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:01,823
That's the other team,
unfortunately.

221
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,582
Oh... boy. Almost got
a glove on it, huh?

222
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,020
That would've been good.

223
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:09,139
You know, I was gonna say,
you and David...

224
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:11,764
Oh, he and Mrs. Rose went
to some wine tasting thing.

225
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:13,753
Oh, he went with Mrs. Rose,

226
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:16,013
yeah, the woman I'm married to?

227
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,772
You know, I was just flashing
on you and David...

228
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:21,815
Oh, come on!
This is not happening.

229
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,608
What is happening?!

230
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:27,146
Oh, you know, we,
we can talk about this later.

231
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:29,792
It's not, it doesn't really
matter. Fellas!

232
00:09:29,877 --> 00:09:31,330
Ugh!

233
00:09:31,415 --> 00:09:33,922
Yes, Stevie!
You're crushing it.

234
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,786
You're breaking through
and I can see it!

235
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:37,222
Ronnie...

236
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:39,388
You too!

237
00:09:39,472 --> 00:09:42,107
- Twyla, where are we going?
- Up!

238
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:43,479
And what're we leaving
behind?

239
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:45,570
Everything and everyone!

240
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:47,482
Yes! Push past
those demons!

241
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:51,193
Leave it behind you
as we ascend to the gateway.

242
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,577
Jocelyn, do you see it?
I think so!

243
00:09:54,788 --> 00:09:57,294
And... class!

244
00:09:58,794 --> 00:10:00,565
Great job, everyon!

245
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:03,888
And remember,
I wanna see all of you

246
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:06,019
signing up for that gateway!

247
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:07,416
Good work.

248
00:10:08,227 --> 00:10:10,880
Oh yeah, I feel amazing.

249
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:12,654
Does anyone wanna sign up
with me?

250
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:13,944
I'm happy to share a tent!

251
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:16,783
If babies are allowed,
I am in.

252
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:20,601
Consider me a convert.
I'm gonna go grab a couple

253
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,085
of those Elevation Hydration
bottles.

254
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,633
So, Stevie, what did you
think?

255
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:28,152
Okay, yeah, I didn't hate it,

256
00:10:28,271 --> 00:10:29,612
but I mean,

257
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,222
does anybody even know
what "the gateway" is?

258
00:10:32,307 --> 00:10:34,288
Um, well, I think it's pretty
obvious...

259
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:38,353
Although, if it'd make you
feel better,

260
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,696
I can totally like clarify

261
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:41,427
some of the language
with Citrus.

262
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:47,079
Yeah. Um, hey! Citrus?

263
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,462
Yeah?

264
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,140
Well, first of all, so great
to finally experience

265
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:52,258
what we're marketing.

266
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:54,122
Well, I'm glad you
enjoyed it, Alexis.

267
00:10:54,818 --> 00:10:56,983
Although,
from a marketing perspective,

268
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:58,897
I think it'd be really
helpful to just like...

269
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:01,542
clarify some of the language
that we're using.

270
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:03,625
Okay. Like what?

271
00:11:03,736 --> 00:11:04,863
Well, first of all,

272
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:08,216
I noticed that you referred to,
um, like "demons" a lot.

273
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:11,952
- Well, we all have demons!
- Yes, and I get that.

274
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:13,608
Carbs. Am I right?

275
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:17,081
Right. But I'm also talking
about actual demons.

276
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,214
Yes...

277
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,315
Okay. I guess I'm just asking
for the people

278
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,920
signing up right now, um,

279
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:25,276
is the gateway like
a symbol for something

280
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:27,551
or is it like an actual
gateway?

281
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:30,146
Oh! It's, it's a symbol.

282
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,596
Okay, good.

283
00:11:32,694 --> 00:11:36,213
But it's also a literal
gateway into the sky.

284
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:38,594
Gotcha.

285
00:11:38,804 --> 00:11:40,465
I hope that cleared
everything up.

286
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:43,442
- Totally.
- Great.

287
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,862
I'm just signing up.
I can't...

288
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:49,705
Oh... it's gonna be good.

289
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:55,815
Hey, Jocelyn?

290
00:11:55,902 --> 00:11:57,475
Can I see that sign-up sheet
for a sec?

291
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,212
Oh, I haven't finished
filling out my social...

292
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:00,319
Oh, that's okay.

293
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:01,800
I'm just gonna go and destroy
this right now,

294
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:03,151
because I get the creeping
suspicion

295
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:05,367
that this place is like,
not okay.

296
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:07,748
Like I feel like this is more
than just a fitness class.

297
00:12:07,914 --> 00:12:10,418
- What do you think it is?
- Um, I think it's a cult.

298
00:12:10,616 --> 00:12:11,913
And like
not the good kind.

299
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,575
Not like when you go
to India to follow

300
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:15,942
a long-haired, sexy man around
for a couple months

301
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,135
and then come home with
a bangin' yoga body.

302
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,430
Yeah, if only someone had
pointed out how weird this was

303
00:12:20,515 --> 00:12:21,626
from the beginning.

304
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,454
Alexis, can I still go on
the trip?

305
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:24,957
I'm not saying that
I need it.

306
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:27,358
It's just last weekend
I snuck Roland Jr.

307
00:12:27,443 --> 00:12:28,624
Into the ball room at Ikea,
just so

308
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,638
I could eat a meatball
by myself.

309
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:32,599
No. No. No one is going on
the trip.

310
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:35,152
And I am so sorry for making
you guys sign up for this.

311
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:36,916
Well, I'm keeping
the Hydration bottles.

312
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:39,035
I can just dump out
the crystal water.

313
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,080
Just a heads up, you guys,
they're almost sold out

314
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:44,337
of the "nocturnal affirmation"
cassette tapes, so...

315
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:45,773
- Twy...
- Now I just need to buy

316
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:48,079
one of their cassette players.
Because you have to make sure

317
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:49,836
they're playing at the right
speed when you're sleeping.

318
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,669
Twy, this is a cult.
I brought you to a cult.

319
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:54,909
Oh my gosh,
did you not know that?

320
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:56,714
My mom tried to take me
to the gateway

321
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,007
for spring break one year.

322
00:12:58,092 --> 00:13:00,377
I just thought I was supporting
your career.

323
00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:02,580
Ugh, how did I fall for this?

324
00:13:02,664 --> 00:13:05,301
Cults prey on sad, weak,
vulnerable people.

325
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:06,890
I'll try not to take
that personally.

326
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:09,331
I've just been so desperate
to like throw myself into work,

327
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,854
and I clearly missed all
the signs

328
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:12,469
and now I've like endangered
all of us.

329
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:14,772
Well, there's an exit sign
right there.

330
00:13:14,883 --> 00:13:17,623
Yup, but the arrow's pointing
straight up.

331
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:21,055
There was an emergency exit
in the change room.

332
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:24,501
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

333
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:25,973
Yeah.

334
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:33,823
Ugh! Okay, you know what?
I'm making a blend.

335
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:36,304
Yes. Make us a nice
Moira-lot...

336
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:38,319
or a Moira Rose-ling.

337
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,908
Hey, not to be too effusive,
but I'd call that one potable.

338
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,590
I have had worst things
in my mouth.

339
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:53,345
I'm so happy that I wrestled
you away today

340
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,938
for this oenological escapade.

341
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,024
I finally have you all
to myself, David.

342
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:02,443
When's the last time you and I
had a whole day together

343
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:04,968
with nary a care in the world?

344
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:07,137
I mean, I am in the middle of
planning a wedding,

345
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,923
while also building
a successful retail empire.

346
00:14:10,008 --> 00:14:11,361
Yes, you are.

347
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:14,043
Then grant me this precious
moment -

348
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:16,205
before there's a ring
on your finger -

349
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,562
to say chin chin to you
and your husband-to-be.

350
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,668
This feels remarkably
selfless.

351
00:14:23,265 --> 00:14:26,164
You and Patrick are two
good grapes.

352
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:27,297
Hmm...

353
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:29,232
Different notes,
different tannins,

354
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:33,633
but... together, you've managed
to make one perfect blend.

355
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:36,540
- Thank you.
- That being said...

356
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,202
- Oh my God.
- If I may impart a...

357
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,941
slice of marital sagacity:

358
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:44,810
you and I,

359
00:14:45,227 --> 00:14:47,124
we're two potent grapes.

360
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:49,190
You know, there's a lot of
your father in Patrick.

361
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:50,317
Don't need that.

362
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:52,399
But just because their notes
are subtle

363
00:14:52,571 --> 00:14:55,562
doesn't mean they require
any less attention.

364
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:57,826
Says the woman who literally
convinced me

365
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,747
to leave my partner alone
at home,

366
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,010
watching a baseball game.

367
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:02,752
You know
I'm right.

368
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:05,661
Your father and I have produced
beautiful wine together

369
00:15:05,746 --> 00:15:08,208
- for over forty years.
- Ew.

370
00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:10,099
And I have absolutely
no doubt

371
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:11,754
that your relationship
with Patrick

372
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,826
is going to get even better
with age.

373
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:19,116
Okay, I hope we've landed on
something,

374
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:21,505
because all I have left
is this cherry ice wine

375
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,383
and I think it might be corked.

376
00:15:23,468 --> 00:15:25,603
Nope. My David has put
together

377
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:28,960
- a delicious blend right here.
- Mmhmm-hmm!

378
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:33,291
Ugh. No. That's not the one
we picked.

379
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:34,919
- Huh?
- That's not the one we picked.

380
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:37,152
What? Well, let's retrace
our steps.

381
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:39,734
No.

382
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:41,743
How many combinations
can there be?

383
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:43,879
No.

384
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:45,917
<i>We'll be back to
the ball game right after...</i>

385
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:47,839
Yeah, I guess I don't need
to turn the volume down

386
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:50,811
- for these commercial breaks.
- Oh, whatever works for you.

387
00:15:52,628 --> 00:15:53,997
It's just I thought you
had something

388
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,520
that you wanted to talk about?

389
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:59,535
Oh, no, just wondering
what the inflation was

390
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,940
on concessions these days,

391
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:03,972
'cause it's been years
since I've been to a ball game.

392
00:16:04,392 --> 00:16:05,633
Well, it's highway robbery.

393
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:08,669
Yeah, you got that right.

394
00:16:09,581 --> 00:16:11,552
It just sorta seemed like you
wanted to talk about David

395
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:12,863
for a second.

396
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:14,485
Felt like that's where
you were goin'.

397
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,922
No, I...

398
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:18,518
sure. Yeah, I can talk about
David.

399
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:21,083
Yeah, my son...

400
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:25,281
Who, uh, you will be...

401
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,905
walking down the aisle
with very soon.

402
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:31,995
Well, technically, you won't be
walking with him...

403
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,441
down the aisle, but...
but um...

404
00:16:35,568 --> 00:16:37,399
Mr. Rose, I don't wanna
cut you off,

405
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:39,296
but um...

406
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:45,032
I'm glad we have a minute
to talk.

407
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:49,050
Because I, I hope it goes
without saying that,

408
00:16:49,348 --> 00:16:51,834
as lucky as I feel
to have met David,

409
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:56,171
I also feel incredibly lucky
to be joining your family.

410
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:58,277
Huh.

411
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:00,732
I love your son

412
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:04,172
and I will always do everything
I can

413
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,215
to respect him

414
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:09,176
and to protect him
from all of the things in life

415
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,544
that can set him off.

416
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:13,468
And there are many, many things
that can set him off...

417
00:17:13,553 --> 00:17:16,629
Oh, I'm aware,
yeah.

418
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:20,173
Um... oh boy, that...

419
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:22,939
pretty much covers it.

420
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:26,354
Uh, I was only gonna say
that I...

421
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,139
I hope you treat him with...
respect,

422
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,115
which you just said
you would,

423
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:35,571
and, of course...
I already knew it.

424
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:39,689
I'm glad we had this talk,
Mr. Rose.

425
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:42,108
Me too. Me too.

426
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:46,519
All right.

427
00:17:50,322 --> 00:17:51,694
<i>Iverson at
the plate,</i>

428
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,485
<i>and here comes the pitch!</i>

429
00:17:53,776 --> 00:17:56,210
<i>Iverson with a...</i>
- Oh... Oh! It's going...

430
00:17:56,295 --> 00:17:58,006
GOING! GONE!

431
00:17:58,091 --> 00:17:59,126
Oh!

432
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:03,093
- Whoa-ho!
- Hey!

433
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:05,643
Wow!

434
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

435
00:18:15,212 --> 00:18:17,810
So, it was this one?

436
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,335
Um, let me just triple check.

437
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,114
No.
No, it's not.

438
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:27,645
Did it oxidize?

439
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,155
Is that why we can't recognize
the tastes?

440
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,423
Okay, if neither of you can
remember which one it was,

441
00:18:33,508 --> 00:18:35,942
maybe we just,
we just call this off.

442
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:40,240
The wife and I had reservations
at the Elmdale Inn an hour ago.

443
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:41,914
It was strawberry-radish.

444
00:18:42,017 --> 00:18:43,442
We don't do anything
with radishes.

445
00:18:43,526 --> 00:18:45,152
Ooh, maybe you should.
That sounds refreshing.

446
00:18:45,236 --> 00:18:46,894
We're not making 
a new wine!

447
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:49,963
There's no need to raise
your voices, Herbert.

448
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:53,810
Okay, speaking of Herbert,
is it Herbert or Erbert?

449
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:56,446
Like when people say Herb
or Erb?

450
00:18:56,531 --> 00:18:59,170
I took the liberty of calling
your husband, Moira,

451
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:01,895
because somebody has to drive
you two home

452
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,811
and it's certainly not going
to be me.

453
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,329
Our designated grapes!

454
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,594
Well, I see the sampling
went well.

455
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,379
- Okay.
- Okay.

456
00:19:11,464 --> 00:19:12,923
We couldn't find a wine.

457
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:15,301
Well, it sorta smells
like you... found all the wine.

458
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:16,700
- What?
- Yeah...

459
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:20,059
Mr. Ertlinger, I hope this
doesn't stand in the way of...

460
00:19:20,144 --> 00:19:21,299
our doing business.

461
00:19:21,384 --> 00:19:23,476
Your wife ensured that
that won't be happening.

462
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:26,241
Between the two of them they
could not find a single wine

463
00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:28,219
they were willing to put
Moira's name on.

464
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:30,660
- I said radish!
- We...

465
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:34,670
Could you please escort
your family out of here?

466
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:36,935
I am very late
for a dinner!

467
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,222
I am offering a major apology
if that'll help.

468
00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:45,754
Okay. I take it keys are in
your purse, Moira?

469
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,439
- Es in a nokia...
- I'm gonna uh...

470
00:19:47,523 --> 00:19:49,963
I'm gonna start the car.
Okay, great!

471
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:51,924
- Yeah.
- What?!

472
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,209
How was your class,
Alexis?

473
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:09,174
Um, it was a big success.
Thank you for asking.

474
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:10,478
Everyone had a great time

475
00:20:10,563 --> 00:20:12,505
and the clients were like
super impressed.

476
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:13,925
Oh, that's good.

477
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:15,724
I wonder if that means they'll
give you priority boarding

478
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:17,804
when you enter the gateway?
Oh my God,

479
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:19,128
Stevie did this,
didn't she?

480
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:21,696
Now, do the step machines
actually lift off the ground,

481
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:24,246
or are the step machines just
there to help you practice

482
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:26,392
for when you walk onto
the spaceship?

483
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:28,156
Come on, David,
she didn't know.

484
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:29,904
- Thank you!
- But now that you do,

485
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:31,802
does it just make the journey
to the gateway

486
00:20:31,887 --> 00:20:34,027
- that much more meaningful?
- Okay, you know what?

487
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:37,197
Honestly, this whole situation
is starting to gross me out.

488
00:20:37,282 --> 00:20:40,033
It's like I'm sharing a room
with my twin brothers who kiss.

489
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:41,298
- Mm!
- Mm...

490
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:45,071
Well, look at this!

491
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:47,581
We have a full house here.

492
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,934
Just came in to say goodnight.
That's not necessary.

493
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:53,871
- John! Open, please!
- Yeah.

494
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,750
Hey! I like sleepovers!

495
00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:59,062
Anyone think I might
like a sleepover?

496
00:20:59,147 --> 00:21:00,801
- Ew...
- Ew!

497
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:03,645
You know, spending
a little extra time together

498
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,496
is not such a bad idea
since we're...

499
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:07,944
losing Alexis soon
to the gateway.

500
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,848
- OH MY GOD-DUH!
- A simple mistake, honey.

501
00:21:11,023 --> 00:21:12,671
So does this happen
every night?

502
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:14,796
- Um, no. No, it doesn't.
- Oh...

503
00:21:15,935 --> 00:21:17,317
Uh, okay.

504
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:19,994
Mm! Stop!

505
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,345

1
00:00:01,539 --> 00:00:03,255
Alexis, I have a favour...

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,924
Oh, great. Um...

3
00:00:05,382 --> 00:00:06,559
I would love a ride to work.

4
00:00:06,593 --> 00:00:08,527
I meant, I have a favour to ask.

5
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:09,939
You just said that you have a favour.

6
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:11,187
As in, for me.

7
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:14,207
Well, who says that, 'I
have a favour for you?'

8
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:16,112
Okay. Are you saying that
you can't drive me to work?

9
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:17,870
No, I can't.

10
00:00:17,904 --> 00:00:19,839
I need you to work
the motel this Friday.

11
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:21,101
Ewww! What?!

12
00:00:21,126 --> 00:00:22,652
We're all pitching in these days, dear.

13
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:25,711
Like communists or non-union actors.

14
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:27,346
Okay. Well, I would love to,

15
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:29,382
but it's my high school
graduation on Friday.

16
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,717
Your graduation is this Friday?

17
00:00:31,752 --> 00:00:32,844
- Mhm.
- What?

18
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:35,203
I didn't tell you because
I don't want you to come.

19
00:00:35,228 --> 00:00:36,688
It's bad enough that I have to wear that

20
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:38,360
unflattering black dress

21
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:40,149
and then the hat with the thing on it

22
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:41,289
in front of people that I don't know.

23
00:00:41,314 --> 00:00:42,563
Yeah, I'm not going.

24
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:43,922
I was at your first graduation

25
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:45,357
and it's not my fault
that you weren't there.

26
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:46,882
We all have to go, David,

27
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,089
unless you have some special excuse.

28
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:50,797
It's my birthday.

29
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:56,132
Yeah. Well...

30
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:57,447
We, we didn't forget.

31
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,774
No, we've been talking
about it for weeks.

32
00:01:00,242 --> 00:01:02,752
You've been talking about it for weeks.

33
00:01:02,787 --> 00:01:04,855
Well, we'll just have to have a birthday

34
00:01:04,889 --> 00:01:07,657
and graduation celebration all in one.

35
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,626
Yeah. I'm very
uninterested in that option.

36
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,913
- As am I.
- No. Seriously don't come.

37
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,212
They can't say we didn't try.

38
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:23,616
- Ugh.
- What?

39
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:25,141
Woof... David.

(Light Jazz music plays)

42
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,519
Oh, can I get a gift receipt for that?

43
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,888
It's for an anniversary.

44
00:01:37,922 --> 00:01:40,090
Oh. Well, isn't that thoughtful.

45
00:01:40,124 --> 00:01:42,959
I wish everyone remembered
special days like that,

46
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:45,775
but, alas, that's not
what this world is anymore.

47
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,032
I'll just take that gift receipt.

48
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,700
Yeah. Okay.

49
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:53,900
- You're a good person.
- Uh.

50
00:01:58,309 --> 00:02:00,443
(Door creaks)

51
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:01,945
Is everything okay?

52
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:03,780
Yeah. It's fine.

53
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:05,397
All right.

54
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:09,999
Here is a question.

55
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:12,963
Um, has your family ever
forgotten your birthday?

56
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,824
Like your parents and your sister,

57
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:16,760
collectively, as a whole?

58
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:18,461
That would be a no.

59
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,196
No, I've always had some kind of party.

60
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:23,033
- Oh.
- In fact, sometimes two parties.

61
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:24,834
One before school ended with my friends.

62
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:26,236
And then another with my family

63
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,738
with my cousins who were
kinda more like siblings.

64
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,341
But they, they forget... other things.

65
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,710
Yeah. I'm sure. Yeah.

66
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,326
I'm kinda piecing together
that it might be your birthday?

67
00:02:38,923 --> 00:02:40,325
Yes, it is.

68
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,529
Well, happy birthday.

69
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:45,822
How old are we...

70
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:49,059
Do you have any plans for today or?

71
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:51,428
Ah, I plan on popping a pill,

72
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,496
crying a bit and falling asleep early.

73
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:55,498
So just a regular weeknight.

74
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,400
Well, it sounds like fun!

75
00:02:57,435 --> 00:02:58,654
It is.

76
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,603
You ever tried the Cafe Tropical?

77
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:03,012
I've heard people raving about how

78
00:03:03,037 --> 00:03:04,841
"moderately edible" the food is there.

79
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,510
Well, yes.

80
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:10,080
We could, we could go
for a birthday dinner.

81
00:03:12,383 --> 00:03:14,938
- You don't have to do that.
- No, I-I'd like to.

82
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:20,353
- Sure.
- Let's say eight o'clock.

83
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:23,994
- Okay.
- Okay.

84
00:03:25,396 --> 00:03:26,763
(Spritzing)

85
00:03:28,526 --> 00:03:31,003
- Those are wet now.
- That's a lot of spritzing.

86
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:33,518
- I'm gonna dry those off.
- Okay.

87
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,109
Okay, another girl dropped
off her resume this morning.

88
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:42,379
Ted, have you read these?

89
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:44,381
These are actually very impressive.

90
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:46,049
There are people here who went to school

91
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,825
specifically for vet stuff.

92
00:03:48,986 --> 00:03:50,353
Yeah, well, y'know,

93
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:52,489
formal training is usually encouraged.

94
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,691
Well, I don't have formal training.

95
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:56,993
This person's assisted with surgeries.

96
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,405
Is that something
that I should be doing?

97
00:03:58,429 --> 00:03:59,996
No. God no.

98
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,432
Well, Ted, if there are
people here that can help you,

99
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:03,833
you should hire them.

100
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:06,631
Well...

101
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:12,175
I'm... very happy with the
job that you're doing.

102
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:16,350
And I... I like having you here.

103
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:20,170
Well, I like being here, but...

104
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:22,719
not as much as like...
(reads) Tiffany Seraris.

105
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:24,421
The poor thing went to cat camp.

106
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:26,334
So what are you saying?

107
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:29,192
Well, I'm saying I didn't realize

108
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:31,861
that there was a huge pile
of way more qualified people

109
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,630
just like waiting to be hired.

110
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:35,342
Yeah. But you're learning.

111
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,951
I know, but I'm taking
someone's desk here.

112
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:42,172
Like someone who actually
wants to touch animals a lot.

113
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,839
Like...

114
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,281
Maybe there's a job out there
that I'm better suited for.

115
00:04:46,778 --> 00:04:49,588
And some other like gorgeous,

116
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:52,449
slightly under qualified
girl is sitting at my desk

117
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:55,051
asking herself the same question.

118
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,486
Okay...

119
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,065
I'm just realizing
that wanting to come in

120
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,390
and laugh at your
animal puns isn't enough

121
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:03,554
when there is like people here.

122
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:06,463
Those were genuine laughs?

123
00:05:06,497 --> 00:05:07,850
Sometimes, yeah.

124
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:12,178
Well, I can't say the
reception will be as fun,

125
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:16,515
but... that's really
generous of you, Alexis.

126
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:18,449
Like, surprisingly generous.

127
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:21,059
No I know.

128
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,651
So, um,

129
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,511
I guess I should go.

130
00:05:29,587 --> 00:05:31,730
I have my graduation tonight, so.

131
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:34,624
Well, it's only eleven.

132
00:05:34,658 --> 00:05:37,060
And I am paying you for the day.

133
00:05:37,094 --> 00:05:38,122
I totally get that.

134
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:39,677
I will stay until four.

135
00:05:39,702 --> 00:05:41,786
Day ends at five, but sure.

136
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,763
(Dog barks)

137
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:50,840
Johnny: Damian Steele.

138
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,552
Okay, we will see you soon! Bye.

139
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,325
Yeah.

140
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,315
Stevie! Stevie!

141
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,177
- Stevie: Have you tried restarting it?
- What?

142
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:04,654
Oh. Sorry, I thought
you were having trouble

143
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:05,708
with the computer again.

144
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,423
No, no.

145
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,592
Well, I'm stuck on all caps, but no.

146
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:11,361
Come here, take a look.

147
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:16,699
Look, we are sold out.

148
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:18,868
I just booked the last room.

149
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:21,114
Are you sure you didn't put
the same reservation in twice?

150
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:22,505
Because you've done that before.

151
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,574
No. Booked.

152
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:27,610
We can now fire up the 'no'
in the 'no vacancy' sign.

153
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:29,479
Oh, yeah, that burnt out years ago.

154
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:32,215
Sadly it hasn't been an issue, but...

155
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:35,485
maybe we could use the 'no'
from the 'no refunds' sign.

156
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,053
All right. We'll figure out.

157
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:41,711
But I am so proud of our little team.

158
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,326
Up here. Come on.

159
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,328
I don't think we're
those kind of people.

160
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:47,212
In the sky! Here we go!

161
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:50,366
Yeah! Big day!

162
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:52,101
Big day, Stevie!

163
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:53,903
Moira: As long as we have some time,

164
00:06:53,938 --> 00:06:59,385
I thought we'd revisit this
delightful little number.

165
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,356
I can't even remember why
we stopped working on it.

166
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:05,682
Because we are an ensemble group

167
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,951
And this requires a lead vocal

168
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:10,687
that just happens to be in your range.

169
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,769
Ronnie,

170
00:07:11,794 --> 00:07:14,490
When one of us shines, all of us shine.

171
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:16,759
That is the meaning of ensemble.

172
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:18,214
Sorry, gals.

173
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:20,730
I just got caught up on the phone.

174
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:24,867
I have good news and, and some bad news.

175
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,403
Oh. Is the bad news that
there is no good news?

176
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:30,164
My aunt used to play
this game with me a lot.

177
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:33,509
The good news is I
just got off the phone

178
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:36,336
with the little towns
big voices festival

179
00:07:36,594 --> 00:07:39,215
and the Elmdale songbirds
have had to drop out

180
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,625
at the last minute.

181
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:42,552
They got a terrible stomach flu

182
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:44,654
that just run right through them.

183
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:47,257
So the festival was wondering

184
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,727
if the Jazzagals would sub in tonight!

185
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,128
- (Happy gasps)
- Oh, wow.

186
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:53,863
And of course the bad news is

187
00:07:53,897 --> 00:07:55,531
that Moira and I won't
be able to attend.

188
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:57,209
(Disappointed reactions)

189
00:07:57,234 --> 00:07:59,135
Oh. I'm sorry, w-why can't I?

190
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:01,371
Because your daughter is
graduating high school.

191
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:04,641
Oh. And what a grand night it will be

192
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:06,075
for you and your charges.

193
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,445
But the Roses' will
not be at graduation.

194
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,249
No, Alexis has veritably
browbeaten us not to attend.

195
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,119
I wouldn't be surprised if she
skips the whole affair herself.

196
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:19,529
Waggish little nymph, that she is. So...

197
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,492
Well, then I guess it's just me

198
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:24,661
that won't be making it to the festival.

199
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,630
Oh, Jocelyn, don't worry
we will do you proud.

200
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:30,276
I think we might just have
the perfect number for it.

201
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,701
Don't you think?

202
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:39,342
♪

203
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:41,477
(Door creaks open and shut)

204
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:44,668
(Keys jingle)

205
00:08:50,332 --> 00:08:52,949
Well, look at you...

206
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,824
You are radiant.

207
00:08:54,988 --> 00:08:56,292
Hardly.

208
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,301
You are, Alexis.

209
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,773
Oh, I'd advise against the mortarboard.

210
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:02,475
It'll flattens the
hair and pull focus away

211
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:04,167
from that beautiful face.

212
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:05,968
Well, I think everyone has to wear one.

213
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,905
Hm. But by not wearing
one, you'll stand out.

214
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:11,441
And by the fact that you're
a good ten years older

215
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:12,875
than everyone else.

216
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,874
Okay.

217
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:17,012
Um, is this straight? Does it look okay?

218
00:09:19,344 --> 00:09:20,711
Mhm.

219
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:22,764
I'm so proud of you.

220
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:24,824
I don't know why.

221
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:26,481
Everybody graduates from high school.

222
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:29,335
You know, it isn't easy.
Especially at your age.

223
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,129
Okay, Can you please stop saying that.

224
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:34,230
Alexis, you've worked very hard

225
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:36,232
and now that you've done this,

226
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:39,710
the world is gonna open up wide for you.

227
00:09:40,738 --> 00:09:42,238
Um, you know...

228
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:44,941
It's not too late if you wanna come.

229
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:46,709
Hey, it's okay. Don't worry about me.

230
00:09:46,744 --> 00:09:48,378
Mommy is going to be fine.

231
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:50,099
And I'll respect your wishes.

232
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:52,763
I'm just saying like
if you do wanna come.

233
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:55,655
Well, it's a little late now.

234
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,629
Whatever, if you have
plans that's totally fine.

235
00:09:57,654 --> 00:09:58,821
Now I do.

236
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:01,357
Now I'm doing a big
concert with the Jazzagals.

237
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,792
Because you're the one who told us

238
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:04,360
you didn't want anyone there.

239
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,229
Okay. Totally is, it's totally fine.

240
00:10:06,263 --> 00:10:07,252
Had I known.

241
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:10,032
It's gonna be long and boring anyway so.

242
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,534
Alexis.

243
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,760
Alexis, I hope you know

244
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:15,905
that you have been and always will be

245
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:18,474
one of my top priorities.

246
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:20,639
Thanks.

247
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,648
Well, we'll see you afterwards.

248
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:27,283
We'll all have lots to celebrate then.

249
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:28,718
All of us.

250
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:39,662
(Crickets chirp)

251
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:42,064
(Music plays softly)

252
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,533
I almost didn't see you there

253
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:46,169
through the mad rush of the
Friday night dinner crowd.

254
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:48,014
I'm just so relieved
that I made a reservation.

255
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:49,405
Yes. Well, You look very nice.

256
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,011
Oh, thanks. Well, you
know, I assumed that the cafe

257
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:53,843
would have a dinner jacket policy

258
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:55,288
and I didn't wanna wear one of theirs.

259
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:58,091
Mhm. Well, the amazing
thing about this place

260
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,492
is that they've done
such a wonderful job

261
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:03,354
of editing down the
menu to a very concise,

262
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:06,088
world-class selection
of international cuisine.

263
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,523
Agreed. Agreed.

264
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:10,560
Dare we try the deep fried
mozzarella stick platter?

265
00:11:10,594 --> 00:11:13,673
Mmm. They do a lovely wine
pairing with that so...

266
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:15,988
Sorry, I'm late.

267
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,335
Is everybody here or
are other people coming?

268
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:21,170
I don't know. Is anyone else coming?

269
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:23,239
No. This is uh, this is it.

270
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:25,608
In case you didn't
know, I'm widely popular.

271
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:27,343
Some might even venture
to call me beloved.

272
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:28,878
That's a bit of a stretch.

273
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:30,279
Welcome Stevie.

274
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,724
I, I, I'm sorry if I'd
known you were coming

275
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:33,983
I would have them set
three places but...

276
00:11:34,017 --> 00:11:36,452
- Oh.
- Did I not tell you?

277
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,488
But, you know, hey,
the more the merrier.

278
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:41,424
I'm just going to hit
the restroom real quick.

279
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,985
And then I'll come back.

280
00:11:46,243 --> 00:11:47,797
Happy birthday.

281
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:49,198
Thank you.

282
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:50,600
- Is this okay?
- Yeah. Why?

283
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:53,336
Because he bought you a present.

284
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,371
It's very nicely wrapped.

285
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:58,608
So I think I'm crashing a date?

286
00:11:58,642 --> 00:12:00,376
Oh, no. No, no.

287
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,979
He thinks you guys
were here, one-on-one.

288
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,413
He brought you a present.

289
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:05,815
I didn't even get you a present.

290
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:07,466
No, I noticed that.

291
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:09,552
Do you want me to look?

292
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:11,794
No I don't want you to look.

293
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:14,244
Okay, I'll just say this...

294
00:12:15,592 --> 00:12:19,425
if there's anything
remotely sentimental in here,

295
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,984
he is on a date with you right now.

296
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:25,935
(Applause)

297
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,971
Sophie Nguyen...

298
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:30,806
(Applause)

299
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:33,709
Brad Poloski...

300
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:35,605
Which ones are your parents?

301
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,292
Oh, um, I told them not to come.

302
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:42,048
Alexis Rose.

303
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,930
(Applause)

304
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:06,596
<i>(Door shuts)</i>

305
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:10,601
Oh, I see you found my present.

306
00:13:10,838 --> 00:13:14,574
Um, Yeah. We just didn't
want anything to spill on it.

307
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:17,087
So you put it on the table?

308
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,041
- Yeah.
- Huh...

309
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:22,007
Open it, David!

310
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:24,110
Oh, no, no, no no,
you can open it later.

311
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:25,502
It's really not a big deal.

312
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:27,528
It's not...

313
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:30,055
This is the first gift
I haven't bought myself

314
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:31,325
in a very long time.

315
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,068
So thank you.

316
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,470
You're gonna be really underwhelmed

317
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:35,871
when you open it. Trust me.

318
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:38,240
It's not-See. It's nothing.

319
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,762
What is it?

320
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,087
Oh, it's just the receipt

321
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,246
from our first sale at the store.

322
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:48,799
Um, this is not nothing.

323
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:52,150
So, thank you.

324
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:55,925
I overheard someone
wanted Mozzarella sticks

325
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:57,533
for their birthday.

326
00:13:57,558 --> 00:13:59,993
Pretty sure I scraped
off all the freezer burn.

327
00:14:00,263 --> 00:14:01,931
Wow. Look at those.

328
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:03,432
Do you guys need anything else?

329
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:05,234
'Cause I'm just heading out so...

330
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:06,836
You know what, I have to go too.

331
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,204
I totally forgot.

332
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:10,439
I'm gonna take some to go.

333
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:13,576
Okay. I should warn you,
these don't travel well.

334
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:16,689
Even coming from the kitchen
they lost a lot of shape.

335
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:26,339
Um, this is a very solid frame.

336
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:27,929
Thank you, I'm learning.

337
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,828
- Shall we?
- Mmm.

338
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:38,801
(Low hum of chatter)

339
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:42,740
- What are you doing here?
- It's your graduation.

340
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:45,243
What do you think I'm doing here?
I was just taking pictures.

341
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:47,485
I just quit, I thought
you wouldn't wanna come...

342
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,112
Let's try to find
another word for 'quit.'

343
00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:52,638
You know, it kinda
implies poor management.

344
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:54,763
Besides you just,

345
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:56,552
'cause you've decided to move on,

346
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:59,428
doesn't mean we can't
still see each other, right?

347
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:01,221
Mhm.

348
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:04,176
Move... down. Sorry.

349
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,975
Sorry. Sorry. Thank you.

350
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:13,005
I'm really glad you're here.

351
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:14,691
Me too.

352
00:15:15,543 --> 00:15:17,583
I'm gonna have to look at those photos

353
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:19,308
before you share them or post them.

354
00:15:19,342 --> 00:15:21,410
Yeah. Of course. Yeah.

355
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,691
(Johnny on the phone) No,
I-I'm very sorry to tell you

356
00:15:25,715 --> 00:15:27,483
that we are all booked up tonight.

357
00:15:27,517 --> 00:15:29,485
No room at the inn!

358
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,605
(Door opens) Yeah.

359
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,057
No, no. I can imagine
with that many kids

360
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:37,593
and a grandmother,
that it might be tough

361
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:39,895
getting last-minute
accommodations but...

362
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,668
Hello? Hello?

363
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:49,338
Wow, isn't this a hot spot
to be on a Friday night, huh?

364
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:51,307
Well, this is a big night, Roland.

365
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:53,582
- That's good.
- Waiting for our last guest.

366
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:55,489
He was supposed to be
show up an hour ago.

367
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:57,889
Well, Johnny, I would love
to sit and wait with you,

368
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:59,915
but I've got a reservation,

369
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,094
so if you could just give me
my room key that'd be great.

370
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:04,296
- You have a reservation?
- Mhm.

371
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:06,388
Yeah. Roland, we have
a full house tonight,

372
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,624
and I do not see your name down here.

373
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:12,425
Johnny, you'll find me
under... Damien Steele.

374
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:18,487
You're Damien Steele?

375
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:19,862
Shh! Come on,

376
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:21,670
I don't want the whole town to find out.

377
00:16:21,705 --> 00:16:23,639
Roland, I've been waiting here all night

378
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:25,174
for Damien Steele

379
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,210
It's David's birthday,
Alexis is graduating.

380
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:30,045
See Johnny, the mayor of the town

381
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,149
can't use his real name
to check into a love motel.

382
00:16:34,184 --> 00:16:35,818
Yeah, it's not a love motel, Roland.

383
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:38,287
Oh, It will be tonight, my friend.

384
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:40,956
See, Jocelyn and I
have a yearly tradition.

385
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:44,193
Every grad night we like to
pretend to be other people...

386
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:47,273
- if you know what I mean.
- Yeah, you just told me what you mean.

387
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,375
Oh, we've been doing this
ever since our own grad night.

388
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,570
If you catch my drift.

389
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:52,178
Yeah, I caught your drift
when you told me what you mean.

390
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:55,504
So when Joce shows up and she says

391
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:57,506
her name is Lisa Meriweather,

392
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,475
just roll with it, okay?

393
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:00,909
Here is your key, Roland.

394
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:02,544
Okay. Damien.

395
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:05,914
Congratulations, graduates,

396
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:07,783
in honor of your achievement,

397
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:10,486
we have an extra special surprise.

398
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,854
- Ted: Hm.
- Hm. Okay.

399
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:13,288
I think we're good here.

400
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,057
Oh really? She said, extra special.

401
00:17:15,091 --> 00:17:16,859
I think we should stay.

402
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:18,560

Well, that was a fun night.

419
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,566
I'm really glad I decided to invest

420
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:20,789
in your business, David.

421
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:25,360
That is really lovely thing to say.

422
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,795
And I'm so glad you did, Patrick,

423
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,207
because you've really helped to turn it

424
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:29,621
into the success that it is.

425
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:32,456
Hmm. A bold claim.

426
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:46,541
(Clears throat)

427
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:53,064
Thank you.

428
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:59,228
- For what?
- Um, I've never done that before...

429
00:18:59,527 --> 00:19:01,528
with a guy.

430
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:06,501
Okay.

431
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:08,884
Yeah. And uh, (chuckle)

432
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:10,906
I was getting a little scared

433
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,374
that I was gonna let you leave here

434
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:14,032
without us having done that.

435
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:15,625
So uh,

436
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:17,153
thank you...

437
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:19,142
for um...

438
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:22,472
making that happen for us.

439
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:27,624
Well, um,

440
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:33,667
fortunately, I'm an
very generous person.

441
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:35,667
So...

442
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:38,494
Can we talk tomorrow?

443
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,173
Hm. We can talk whenever you'd like.

444
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:46,915
Just preferably not before 10 a.m.,

445
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,298
Um, 'cause I'm not
really a morning person.

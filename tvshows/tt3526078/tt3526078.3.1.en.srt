2
00:00:04,234 --> 00:00:06,636
Moira: David, this isn't funny!

3
00:00:06,669 --> 00:00:09,153
I have my first Town
Hall meeting in an hour,

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,839
where is my portfolio?!

5
00:00:10,874 --> 00:00:13,843
Uh, why... why would I know
where your portfolio is?

6
00:00:13,877 --> 00:00:16,144
You were bedazzling it last night.

7
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:17,250
Excuse me?

8
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:19,815
I haven't bedazzled
anything since I was 22.

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,068
David, you were dressed
like a harlequin,

10
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:24,861
and you were gluing shiny jewels...

11
00:00:24,897 --> 00:00:26,698
perhaps that was just a night terror.

12
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:29,039
Um... oh God.

13
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:30,431
Okay.

14
00:00:30,455 --> 00:00:31,640
Oh.

15
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,734
Well! Uh...

16
00:00:34,253 --> 00:00:36,020
(Gasps) Hello.

17
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:39,545
Hi, uh, I'm-I'm Jake.

18
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:41,805
- Oh, of course you are.
- (They chuckle)

19
00:00:41,831 --> 00:00:44,917
- David?
- Um, Jake, this is my mother.

20
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:46,685
Listen, I'm really sorry,

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,220
I didn't think anybody would be home.

22
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:51,957
Okay, nobody was supposed to be home.

23
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,792
Nobody was supposed to be home, so...

24
00:00:53,826 --> 00:00:55,093
You were supposed to be at lunch,

25
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:57,161
why-why are-why were you not at lunch?!

26
00:00:57,197 --> 00:01:00,625
David, stop acting like
a disgruntled pelican!

27
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:02,533
I came home from lunch
because I realized

28
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:04,368
- I misplaced my portfolio.
- ... folio.

29
00:01:04,403 --> 00:01:06,015
So we're-I'm gonna...
we're gonna look for it.

30
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,085
- Johnny: David,
- Oh my God!

31
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:08,192
we're looking for your
mother's portfol...

32
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:10,328
Oh. Oh! Okay.

33
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:13,144
Hello, uh, Johnny Rose. You are?

34
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:14,947
- Jake.
- Yes, welcome, welcome, Jake.

35
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,483
I see uh, David's made
you feel right at home.

36
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:18,617
- Okay, Dad!
- John...

37
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:20,944
No, no, no, I'm just
saying, carry on doing...

38
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:23,539
whatever you're doing, or not... doing.

39
00:01:23,572 --> 00:01:24,492
- Okay.
- I mean, I see things

40
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:25,966
- No. Got it, got it...
- are wrapping up here, so...

41
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:27,292
- so much.
- Oh my God!

42
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:29,756
- Oh my God!
- Alexis, this is Jake.

43
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:31,096
We seem to have caught the boys in a...

44
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:32,497
In an "afternoon delight."

45
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:34,426
- Is that term still a going thing?
- No, that's no.

46
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,198
- No, never say that again.
- Don't do that.

47
00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:37,753
Um David, I thought we agreed,

48
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:39,097
only when nobody was home.

49
00:01:39,122 --> 00:01:40,706
Nobody was home!

50
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,933
- Nobody was home!
- Oh, here it is!

51
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,492
Ha ha ha!

52
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:46,353
Nice to meet you, Jacob.

53
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:48,180
If you take half as much care of our son

54
00:01:48,213 --> 00:01:49,814
- as you do your physique,
- Okay!

55
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:51,831
David should be in very good hands.

56
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:53,347
Yes, well, not-not your hands,

57
00:01:53,372 --> 00:01:56,008
- Mhmm, yep. Bye!
- but uh... generally speaking...

58
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:57,789
Well, I hope it was worth it.

59
00:01:57,823 --> 00:01:59,691
Okay, I think you can
take a step outside.

60
00:01:59,725 --> 00:02:01,853
You can step outside
while this is happening.

61
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,328
Let him change.

62
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:05,296
You're like a predator!

00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:07,748

What opportunity?

Well, Cal's doing big business,

73
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:31,490
and since you two are sharing an office,

74
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:34,026
uh, I thought you might
wanna get in on some of it.

Sharing an office?

76

You've... rented out my office space?!

Cal: I should add that
registration is totally free,

there's no charge
whatsoever for registration,

within the next two weeks,

Far from it.

00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:07,334
No, my-my computer was
riddled with viruses.

I mean, Cal uh, he fixed it,

over the phone! (Laughs)

93
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:14,973

That's how good he is.

Bob, I've got a meeting

and I cannot be conducting business

97

with somebody yammering
into the phone beside me!

Johnny, you're putting me
in a bit of a pickle here.

You know, obviously I'd
like to keep you both.

00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,800
But there's uh...

101
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:33,384
a cardboard box over there,

102
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:34,920
you know, if you do
feel like you wanna...

103

- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

Um, what are you...
what are you doing here?

110
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:53,084
I just popped in to say hello.

111
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:54,811
Yeah, he came to say hi to me.

112
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:57,091
Oh... yeah.

113
00:03:57,115 --> 00:03:59,877
Um, and-and what... and um...

114
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:01,812
how long have you been here for?

115
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:03,681

116
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:05,427
I'm just curious.

Yeah. Yeah.

123

Well, I should probably head.

Ahh...

00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:37,514
- I'll be in touch, all right?
- Okay, yeah.

132
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:38,903
- Okay.
- Okay.

134
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,168
What the flying (bleep)
is going on here?!

135
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:50,329
I was gonna ask you the same thing!

136
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:53,064
- What was that?!
- Uh, what was that?!

137
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:55,237
We're seeing each other!

138
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:57,536
Okay, we're seeing each other.

139
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:00,346
He literally came here from my room.

140
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:05,045
Well, he dropped me off
at work this morning.

141
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:06,403
He what?!

142
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:07,983
He dropped me off...

143
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:09,264
- at work this morning!
- Okay, I get it!

144
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:11,646
Um, he did not mention that to me.

145
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,685
And... frankly,

146
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:17,723
I don't know whether I
want your sloppy seconds!

147
00:05:17,757 --> 00:05:19,757
Uh, first of all, who
says they're sloppy,

148
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:22,817
and second, who's to say we're
not getting his sloppy thirds?!

149
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:23,863
(Gasps)

150
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,798
Who knows how many people he's
got on the go at this point?

151
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:33,071
Okay, well all I know is
that someone is sloppy...

152
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:34,706
and it's not me!

153
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:38,139
Moira: Well, hello, everyone!

154
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,798
What time is curtain?

155
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:41,956
We'll probably start in a few minutes.

156
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,271
Well, it looks like a
full house out there.

157
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:46,350
Huh! So uh...

158
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:49,053
is this what everyone's wearing?

159
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:52,230
Well, I might lose the jacket.

160
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:55,403
If we look to have
given up on ourselves,

161
00:05:55,427 --> 00:05:57,262
how can we assure our constituents

162
00:05:57,295 --> 00:06:00,014
that we haven't given
up on them as well?

163
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:02,963
So we look like we've
given up on ourselves?

164
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,603
Could we remember please
that these are real people,

165
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:08,127
with real problems, people!

166
00:06:08,338 --> 00:06:10,809
And while I can't pretend
to fully understand them,

167
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:13,636
I can at least attempt to care!

168
00:06:13,661 --> 00:06:15,560
Places, please!

169
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,218
(Car rumbles by)

170
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,216
Um, okay, so I downloaded this app,

171
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:21,276
basically so clients can schedule

172
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:22,788
their appointments online.

173
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:25,012
It just saves me answering the phone.

174
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:26,658
Right, so then...

175
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:28,492
what will you do?

176
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:33,153
Thank you for asking, Ted.

177
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:35,355
And here is my answer.

178
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,560
Um, my answer...

179
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:39,646
starts by me saying...

180
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,358
So, you two call each other?

181
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:44,273
Hey! Um, about what?

182
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:45,630
You're dressed the same.

183
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,091
Ah, never heard that one before.

184
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,524
- How are you?
- I'm good, good.

185
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:53,973
Tennessee and I are actually
goin' on a trip for a while, so...

186
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,418
Wow, like, Tulum? Or...

187
00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:59,800
Uh, just gonna get in our
car, and drive up the coast,

188
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:02,009
let the road take us where it wants.

189
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:04,995
No plans, no phones, no schedules.

190
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:06,668
Basically my worst nightmare.

191
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,093
Sounds very adventurous.

192
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:10,721
Yeah, well, I just needed to
get away for a while, you know?

193
00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:13,223
So uh, what's new with you guys?

194
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:17,209
Well, Alexis came home to
a naked man in her bathroom.

195
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:21,245
- Cool.
- Um no, it wasn't cool,

196
00:07:21,278 --> 00:07:23,481
because he wasn't actually there for me,

197
00:07:23,516 --> 00:07:24,714
which made everything very awkward,

198
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,550
and uncomfortable for everyone.

199
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:28,519
Well, you're free to use
the barn while I'm away.

200
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:30,254
You know, if you need some privacy.

201
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:32,043
I was actually looking for
someone to water the plants,

202
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,901
and check over the place, so...

203
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,526
Oh, well, thank you, Mutt.

204
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,699
That actually might be good for me.

205
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:39,730
Well, we're leaving this
afternoon, so you know,

206
00:07:39,764 --> 00:07:42,100
just swing by and grab the keys.

207
00:07:42,824 --> 00:07:44,521
That's very generous.

208
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:47,442
Is that weird?

209
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:50,473
Daycare Worker: Parents are complaining

210
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:53,978
that they're struggling to get off
work early enough to pick up their kids,

211
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:55,721
and so that's why we
would like to extend

212
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:58,576
the after school daycare
program by half an hour.

213
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,762
(Applause)

214
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:04,130
That's an idea we'll...

215
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,380
give some real thought to.

216
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:08,505
Spoken like a true politician.

217
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:09,692
(Audience laughs)

218
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:12,206
Ah! Vivacity aside,

219
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,723
our children's safety
is no laughing matter.

220
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:17,130
As a mother who once
invested a great deal

221
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:20,247
of time and money into her children,

222
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:21,848
I, for one, stand by

223
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:24,201
the request to extend
the hours of the daycare.

224
00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:26,231
(Applause)

225
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:30,456
One might think that an additional
30 minutes will have no impact,

226
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:32,551
but you tell that to the mother

227
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:35,386
whose manicurist just
applied the wrong color,

228
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:37,495
and must start all over again,

229
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,284
or the father who got stuck in a mine!

230
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:44,191
That extra half hour
could be the difference

231
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:46,268
between a child who
gets picked up safely,

232
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,567
and one who wanders the street,

233
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,229
waiting for a dust-covered man
to emerge from the darkness!

234
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:54,995
We do wait with the kids...

235
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,056
Is that really what
we want for our town?

236
00:08:58,277 --> 00:09:00,090
Homeless toddlers?!

237
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:01,788
Tugging at your pant legs?!

238
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:04,807
Okay Moira, I think
you've made your point.

239
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:07,552
I assure you, council
will examine this issue

240
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:09,653
thoroughly and carefully.

241
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:12,724
Your children will be
safe, that is a promise!

242
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,432
(Thunderous applause)

243
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:22,208
Moira, what are you doing?
You undermined my authority!

244
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:24,895
We were losing our audience!
You saw the walkouts.

245
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:26,153
And on opening night!

246
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:27,889
- This isn't a theatre!
- Isn't it?

247
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:30,650
Look, you can't go making
blind promises to these people!

248
00:09:30,684 --> 00:09:32,365
This isn't "Sunrise Bay,"

249
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:34,754
where everybody lives
in a perfect dream world!

250
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:35,772
I'll have you know,

251
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:37,790
Sunrise Bay was a coastal community

252
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:40,403
plagued by a centuries-old curse!

253
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:42,095
I hate to jump in here,

254
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:45,365
but you told me I should use
the bathroom during the break,

255
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,000
and uh, the line's getting really long!

256
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:49,865
- Go for it, Bob.
- Ohhh!

257
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,809
Ronnie, you have whispers
of a maternal instinct.

258
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:54,508
Isn't this issue important to you?

259
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:57,044
It's not a matter of importance,
it's a matter of money!

260
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,403
Then find the money!

261
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:00,802
Ohhh, okay, why don't I just tiptoe

262
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:02,975
into my orchard of money trees,

263
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:05,514
and fill my basket with money for you!

264
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,817
And while we're at it,

265
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:09,278
why don't I gather up
some diamond carrots,

266
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:11,222
and some golden potatoes!

267
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:12,808
And I don't mean the
kind of potatoes you eat,

268
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:13,966
I mean, the...

269
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:16,466
potatoes that are made
out of actual gold.

270
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:18,558
Okay, there must be some solution.

271
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,432
To the problem you just caused?

272
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:22,942
I'm sure you'll figure somethin' out.

273
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,138
Oh, welcome to the show.

274
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,442
Johnny: Well, first, I
wanna say thank you, Amy,

275
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:33,477
for taking the time to see me today.

276
00:10:33,513 --> 00:10:35,113
It's actually Amygrace.

277
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:38,149
Amygrace, well, apologies.

278
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:40,351
It's funny, 'cause I
remember when our families

279
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:43,465
used to vacation together,
you were just "Little Amy."

280
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,216
I've always been Amygrace.

281
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:46,520
Ah...

282
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,894
well then, just call me Johnnymichael.

283
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:51,434
(Laughs)

284
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:58,125
You know, I-I'm very
interested in your business,

285
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,837
Amy... grace.

286
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:01,340
It's been very fulfilling.

287
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:04,643
Yeah. "Screamnastics."

288
00:11:04,677 --> 00:11:07,993
"Screamnastics," I read that's
a combination of gymnastics

289
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:10,071
and um... screaming?

290
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:12,393
Scream therapy, yes.

291
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:14,346
And extreme juicing.

292
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:18,123
Ah well, I'm a big juice fan myself.

293
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:19,524
Just so you know, Mr. Rose,

294
00:11:19,558 --> 00:11:20,958
most orange juices have

295
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:23,161
frighteningly high sugar levels.

296
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:24,663
Okay...

297
00:11:25,588 --> 00:11:28,066
So, here's the important thing.

298
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,907
I believe this town
could be the perfect spot

299
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:32,803
for your next franchise.

300
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:34,840
Here's the issue, Mr. Rose,

301
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:36,586
I've been touring small towns,

302
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:39,745
in an extensive market research trip.

303
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:41,712
And unfortunately,
what we're discovering

304
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:45,331
is that most "rural" communities

305
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:48,220
just don't have the
same interest in health.

306
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:49,855
Or wellness.

307
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:50,984
Or what we like to call,

308
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:54,115
"Screamnastic inner/outer
beauty connectivity."

309
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:56,130
Well, I know a lot of people here

310
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:59,322
who are very connected to
their inner and outer beauty.

311
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,166
And even more who could use

312
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,333
some of that "Screamnastic"
connect... tivity.

313
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,239
I love your enthusiasm, Mr. Rose.

314
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:08,673
It's very "Screamnastic."

315
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:12,043
Well, this town is very
"Screamnastic," Amygrace.

316
00:12:12,077 --> 00:12:15,139
Why don't we circle back
in I don't know, six months,

317
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:17,725
and see how things are going then?

318
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,893
Yes, sure, sure, sure. We can do that.

319
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,897
Tell you what, why not
make it three months?

320
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:24,655
Let's circle back in three months,

321
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:26,250
and that way we might be able to...

322
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:28,025
open a "Screamnasium" by Christmas.

323
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,860
Oh, we don't call them that.

324

327

what happened to you guys.

328

Well, we're okay.

329

We're doing just fine, thank you.

330

I'm just putting the
last coat on it now.

- Ah.
- I think I'm getting a little high...

340
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:11,745
- from the fumes.
- Oh, that's nice.

341
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,504
Uh, we know that you're
seeing both of us.

- So...
- Okay.

Wait, did you not know that?

344
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:19,911
Uh, no, we did not.

345
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:21,679
I mean, when you kissed
us both on the mouth

00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:24,014
we sort of pieced it together.

Listen, I don't want to cause any drama.

348
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:28,286
- We don't want any drama!
- Who wants drama?

349
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:30,221
Nobody... does.

350
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:33,024
Some clarity would've been nice.

351
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:34,692
- You know?
- Totally, yeah.

352
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:36,051
I just uh...

353
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:38,144
I assumed you guys were cool with it.

354
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,575
Yeah, I don't think it's a
matter of not being cool with it,

355
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,801
I don't think that's...
that's not what this is,

356
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:45,971
it's um, what this
is, is a clarity thing.

357
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:47,261
Yeah.

358
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:49,841
So you are cool with it?

359
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:53,278
Yeah, I'm cool with it now.

360
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,380
I'm not not cool with it.

361
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:58,385
I don't think that was
ever the thing, so...

362
00:13:58,418 --> 00:14:00,888
I don't think anybody's
not cool here. (Scoffs)

00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:03,740
Okay, cool.

Well, hello again, you beautiful people.

366
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:18,144
I would love to circle
back to this matter

367
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:20,838
of the extended daycare hours.

368
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:23,741
Although I made some excellent points,

369
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,945
in the interest of a fair
and balanced discussion,

370
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:30,278
I will now argue the
other side of the issue.

371
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,177
(Surprised whispers)

372
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:37,355
One of my fondest memories
from childhood were weekdays,

373
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:40,114
between 5:30 and 6 P.M.

374
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,927
That was our time!

375
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:43,567
And we would've fought anyone

376
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,764
who dared try to take it away from us.

377
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:48,809
So you're not extending the hours?

378
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:53,261
Do we really want Big Brother
programming every waking minute

379
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:55,105
of our children's lives?!

380
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,442
So is that a yes or a no, I...

381
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:59,961
- It's an absolutely.
- Absolutely what?

382
00:14:59,985 --> 00:15:01,921
Absolutely crucial...

383
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:06,368
absolutely crucial!

384
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:09,306
Crucial that we...

385
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,057
approach-that...

386
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:13,291
that we entertain every...

387
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:15,289
- approach. I don't...
- Ahem!

388
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:17,024
We'll think about it.

Hey, it's you.

396
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:40,350
Um, we just came by to pick
up the keys for the barn.

397
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,437
The keys to... this barn?

398
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:46,024
Yeah, Mutt asked me to just pop by,

399
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:49,046
and keep an eye on the
place while you are gone.

400
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:51,562
Okay.

401
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,631
This is just the first
I'm hearing about it,

402
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:55,466
which is fine.

403
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,201
If I had known you were
staying at our place,

404
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:59,203
I would've cleaned the
sheets for you guys.

405
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:00,833
Oh no, we're not together.

406
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,312
You literally could not
have said that any faster.

407
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:07,090
Hey babe, I'm just
getting caught up here.

408
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:10,249
So, Alexis is crashing at our place?

409
00:16:10,274 --> 00:16:11,546
Not crashing.

410
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,660
It just caught me off
guard, 'cause I didn't know

411
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:15,921
that there was an arrangement here.

412
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:17,684
I don't know about arrangement,

413
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,390
it just sorta happened.

414
00:16:19,424 --> 00:16:21,177
You're the one who said you
don't like to plan things.

415
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:23,615
Well, I like to plan things sometimes.

416
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,359
Uh, so Tennessee,

417
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,666
Mutt tells us that you guys
are heading up the coast?

418
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,591
- Yes!
- Yeah, we're meeting some friends.

419
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,553
We're going on a pinecone harvest.

420
00:16:32,128 --> 00:16:34,205
Pinecone harvest?

421
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,889
We're picking pinecones.

422
00:16:35,914 --> 00:16:38,143
I got this old compass at a flea market;

423
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:41,111
we're just gonna drive
until we see the pine trees.

424
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:44,349
Hmm, that sounds like it is gonna be...

425
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:46,116
super fun and intense.

426
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:48,687
Mutt, you didn't tell me about...

427
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:50,956
Yeah, the pinecones.

428
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,191
So, we know roughly where we're going.

429
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:55,192
I'm pretty sure the
compass is broken, though.

430
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:58,830
Well, I think that it's better
to just freefall into it.

431
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:01,437
- Yes.
- Yeah, but like I said,

432
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:02,859
it wouldn't hurt to bring a map.

433
00:17:02,884 --> 00:17:04,511
Anyway, you pick the pinecones,

434
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:05,971
and they harvest the seeds.

435
00:17:05,996 --> 00:17:08,893
It sounds like this is
going to be like, a very um,

438

- Here's hoping.
- Hmm! Yeah.

439
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:18,650
So uh, here's the keys.

440
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:21,185

Pinky swear.

443
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:27,258
Hmm, we should probably get going.

444
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:28,727
We were going...

445
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,061

Oh yeah, definitely
want to get a soak in,

486
00:19:28,387 --> 00:19:29,972
What's that?

487
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:32,150
But just because no
one is currently seeing

488
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:34,251
all the wonders of
which you are capable,

489
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:36,471
does not mean that you are not

490
00:19:36,497 --> 00:19:40,090
one of the most talented
people in this family.

491
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:45,000
Well, thank you, Moira.

492
00:19:45,213 --> 00:19:47,842
David: Has he thrown up yet?
- Oh, go to bed!

493
00:19:47,866 --> 00:19:50,103
- Alexis: It's six o'clock!
- Goodnight!

494
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:58,403
So, on a scale of one...

495
00:19:58,427 --> 00:19:59,694
to a Sao Paolo hangover,

496
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,288
how are we feeling right now?

497
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:03,146
I wouldn't have gotten
out of bed this morning.

498
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:06,273
Children, have some respect
for your father's condition.

499
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:07,976
I'm feeling fine, Moira.

500
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:10,811
- You don't look fine.
- I'm fine!

501
00:20:11,047 --> 00:20:12,513
Okay...

502
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:14,481
All right, ready to order?

503
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:15,983
Yeah, toast...

504
00:20:16,018 --> 00:20:19,201
dry toast, and more coffee, please.

505
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:22,084
And I know it's early, but
I'm kind of feeling like,

506
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:23,791
a big piece of fish.

507
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:25,028
Mm!

508
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:28,538
Um... and I'll have a bowl of room
temperature hollandaise sauce, please.

509
00:20:28,563 --> 00:20:30,397
Oh, that's funny, very funny.

510
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:31,780
- Don't listen to them, John.
- Very funny.

511
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:34,733
Don't listen and pick a point
on the wall if you need to.

512
00:20:34,915 --> 00:20:37,351
Just a fruit cup for me, please.

513
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:39,207
Anything else?

514
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,223
Um yeah, I would love
to order something else,

515
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:44,132
but I'm just having
trouble... seeing the menu.

516
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:45,358
Yeah, so um...

517
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:47,382
if we could somehow
make it brighter in here?

518
00:20:47,406 --> 00:20:49,384
Okay, you know what, kids? Stop it.

519
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,958
Okay, well, I will be
right back with the toast,

520
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:54,522
fruit, fish, and... sauce.

521
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:56,397
- Thanks.
- Perfect.

522
00:20:56,874 --> 00:20:58,559
Have you no empathy?!

523
00:20:58,594 --> 00:21:01,537
Stop persecuting your father,
we all know he's in a bad way.

524
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:02,961
No bad way, Moira,

525
00:21:02,997 --> 00:21:05,365
I'm actually feeling pretty good.

526
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:09,132
Well I, for one think we should
celebrate your resilience!

527
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,476
A toast!

528
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,108
- A toast!
- (Loud clink)

529
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:14,387
All right, you know what,
I'm sitting at another table.

It's exactly the kind of paranoia

1
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:08,138
<i>I-I can see you!
Can you see me?</i>

2
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:10,536
Finally! How many days
has it been?

3
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:11,676
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.</i>

4
00:00:11,764 --> 00:00:13,462
<i>We ended up having to extend
our research trip.</i>

5
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:15,507
<i>But it was totally worth it
because we discovered</i>

6
00:00:15,594 --> 00:00:18,483
<i>a new breed of fly
that mates with itself.</i>

7
00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:20,635
Yummm! Mm.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,359
Well, I guess if this is
what you look like

9
00:00:22,446 --> 00:00:23,863
after finding some gross fly,

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,040
I can forgive you for being
away for so long.

11
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,185
<i>I've actually been bench
pressing 100-pound tortoises</i>

12
00:00:28,272 --> 00:00:29,869
<i>because there's no gym here.</i>

13
00:00:29,956 --> 00:00:32,481
Ted! Stop making me jealous
of turtles.

14
00:00:32,568 --> 00:00:36,702
<i>Tortoises, but I do have
tur-tell you</i>

15
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:40,532
<i>that I've been thinking
about you, a lot,</i>

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,995
<i>especially at nighttime.</i>

17
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:45,189
What a coincidence.

18
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:47,443
I've been thinking about you
a lot.

19
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:49,098
At nighttime.

20
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:53,113
I've been all alone and lonely.

21
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:54,239
Oh!

22
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:57,079
Oh my God, David!
Knock much?!

23
00:00:57,198 --> 00:00:58,427
<i>Hi, David!</i>

24
00:00:58,515 --> 00:01:00,778
Hi. Is he dressed?

25
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:02,389
- Yes!
- Ugh. Forget it.

26
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,172
Okay, we're celebrating
our anniversary.

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,476
Can you give us some privacy,
please?

28
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:08,335
Kids, just wanna let you know

29
00:01:08,423 --> 00:01:10,154
I'm taking the car this morning.

30
00:01:10,242 --> 00:01:11,036
- Ugh!
- Mm.

31
00:01:11,124 --> 00:01:12,577
You might wanna say hi to Ted.

32
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,708
He and Alexis were about
to engage in cyber-sex.

33
00:01:15,796 --> 00:01:17,189
Mm!

34
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:19,299
- Hi, Ted.
- <i>Hi, Mr. Rose.</i>

35
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:20,865
Alexis,
what have I told you

36
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:22,694
about putting your body
on the internet?

37
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:24,923
Never! Never without proper
lighting.

38
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:26,226
Can everyone get out, please?!

39
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:28,641
I haven't seen my boyfriend
in like eight days.

40
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:31,601
And I haven't seen my furry
Fendi's for weeks.

41
00:01:31,744 --> 00:01:32,855
<i>Hi, Mrs. Rose!</i>

42
00:01:32,943 --> 00:01:34,737
No. We're not engaging
with them.

43
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:37,284
Everybody out so I can
finish off with Ted!

44
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:39,829
- Sick!
- Ugh! Goodbye, please!

45
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:40,999
Found them!

46
00:01:41,363 --> 00:01:43,850

Episode Title :<font color=#FFc30f>"The Job Interview"</font>

48
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,355
What took you so long?

49
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,128
Uh, you said it was
an emergency,

50
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:57,827
- so I came straight here.
- You stopped for coffee?

51
00:01:57,914 --> 00:01:59,947
And a breakfast burrito
that I got to go.

52
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:01,717
So what's going on?

53
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:05,786
I need you to help me...

54
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,209
put together an outfit.

55
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:10,317
'Kay, I have a job interview
this afternoon

56
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:12,182
and I need to look
professional.

57
00:02:12,484 --> 00:02:14,755
So, does that mean you're
officially leaving the motel?

58
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:17,327
No. just, I don't know,

59
00:02:17,415 --> 00:02:19,765
I'm just, you know, trying
to see what's out there.

60
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:21,367
- Mm.
- And...

61
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,453
Larry Air is hosting
an open call

62
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,108
for employment opportunities.

63
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:30,512
Okay, "Larrierre" sounds
like a dollar-store perfume.

64
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,997
It's an airline.

65
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,479
Larry is the name of the CEO.

66
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:36,541
He used to own a chain
of delis,

67
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,588
but then he sold them

68
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:40,761
to buy a bunch of planes.
Mm.

69
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:43,199
I get to travel,
see the world.

70
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:45,134
Mhmm. You know that
I was once told

71
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:47,194
that I would make an excellent
flight attendant.

72
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:49,427
Hmm! By who?

73
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:52,002
Sandy, the hostess on
our private plane.

74
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,456
She once let me debone
a branzino

75
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:56,872
during turbulence.
So what're you trying to say?

76
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,182
You don't think I have what it
takes to be a flight attendant?

77
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:01,347
No. I just think if it's
between the two of us,

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,197
we all know who's getting
the job.

79
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,503
Oh! Okay.

80
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,703
Why don't you come with me then
and...

81
00:03:07,915 --> 00:03:09,525
and we'll see who gets it.

82
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:13,979
Well, if this is what
we're working with,

83
00:03:14,176 --> 00:03:16,910
I think we can hand me
the contract today.

84
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:18,792
I need a boot.

85
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:21,604
I think the pitch
for the new motel went well.

86
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:23,020
If all goes to plan,

87
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:26,116
we should be able to move
forward even without Stevie.

88
00:03:26,657 --> 00:03:28,090
I want you to know, Johnny,

89
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:31,050
I am not gonna abandon you
like she did.

90
00:03:31,137 --> 00:03:34,405
- Stevie didn't abandon us.
- Well, jump ship.

91
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:36,041
Look, origami!

92
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,566
All right, gentlemen,
I spoke with my manager

93
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:39,884
and everyone's in agreement

94
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:41,253
that this proposal
is excellent.

95
00:03:41,341 --> 00:03:43,192
Ah! That sounds good!

96
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:46,631
Unfortunately, we couldn't
offer the loan at this time.

97
00:03:47,817 --> 00:03:49,732
Sorry, I might've gotten
confused there.

98
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,301
The bank has assessed that
you don't have enough assets

99
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,592
to secure the loan.

100
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,727
I have assets.
I'm invested in the motel.

101
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:59,069
Which doesn't appear
to be in your name.

102
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:01,202
That's right, it's in
my partner's name.

103
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,857
So, you're Stevie Budd?

104
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:04,658
No.
Believe it or not,

105
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:06,051
that's actually a woman's name.

106
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,178
Look, there must be something
we can do here.

107
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:10,529
I ran a major business
for 30 years.

108
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,301
Yeah, and look at the way
this guy bounced back

109
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,962
from total financial ruin.

110
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,607
You know, there was a day
when banks

111
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:17,775
would provide loans
based solely

112
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,365
on their faith in a very solid
business idea.

113
00:04:21,453 --> 00:04:23,542
That's gonna be a tough sell
to my boss.

114
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,457
We don't offer faith-based
loans.

115
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:28,134
Okay, uh, I did not wanna
play this card,

116
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:29,684
but... I will.

117
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,720
I am the mayor.
You already mentioned that.

118
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:34,764
'Kay, did I mention I went
steady with your mom?

119
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:35,984
Unfortunately, you did.

120
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:38,335
Okay, then I'm out.
I got nothing.

121
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:42,339
Honey, you're home!

122
00:04:42,426 --> 00:04:43,818
Yay!

123
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:46,021
Alexis!

124
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:48,649
Your father and I are going
to meet for a celebratory lunch

125
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:50,261
when he's done at the bank,
and...

126
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,459
I was supposed to invite you
to join us.

127
00:04:52,547 --> 00:04:54,201
Yeah, I'm a little busy.

128
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:57,384
What in God's name do you
have there?

129
00:04:57,558 --> 00:05:00,193
Please tell me it's not
a testudine.

130
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,674
No, it's a turtle.

131
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:05,770
Alexis!
Turtles do not pets make.

132
00:05:05,924 --> 00:05:08,840
The poor things are riddled
with a myriad of diseases.

133
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:11,975
You may as well tie a leash
around a raw chicken cutlet.

134
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,499
Relax, they said he's already
been washed.

135
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:16,323
Say hello to Ted.

136
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:19,086
Hello, Theodore.
I don't see the computer.

137
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:21,201
No, I've named the turtle Ted.

138
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:23,856
All the blogs about successful
long-term relationships

139
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:27,469
say that the key is creating
shared experiences.

140
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:29,035
Oh dear.

141
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:31,550
If your coupling is
too frangible to survive

142
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:33,060
this brief disunion...

143
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:34,867
Okay, I am trying my best.

144
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:36,889
Is this supposed to be making
me feel better?

145
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:39,069
Oh, very well. Alexis,

146
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:41,699
if you desire a love
with longevity,

147
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:44,905
the key is to have as little
in common as possible.

148
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:48,054
After an award-worthy trilogy
of decades together,

149
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:52,207
your father and I still
astonish each other.

150
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:55,242
Although today,
I will but feign surprise

151
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,933
when he tells me
he's secured a hefty loan

152
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:00,415
to initiate our imminent
connecting departure

153
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:02,392
from this lengthy layover.

154
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,852
You'll be coming with?

155
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,509
No. I have to give Ted
his pellets,

156
00:06:07,597 --> 00:06:09,653
and then put him down
for a little nap.

157
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:11,381
Sexy.

158
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:14,492
Mm! Mm!

159
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:18,996
Now is this look comfortable
for you, or uncomfortable?

160
00:06:19,268 --> 00:06:21,566
Uh, you dress for the job
you want.

161
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:23,133
So you wanna be a youth
pastor?

162
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,136
Hi. Wow. While, that joke was
surprisingly sharp,

163
00:06:26,223 --> 00:06:27,554
these are Patrick's clothes.

164
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:30,159
So, you might wanna tell that
to my fiancé's face.

165
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:33,344
Mm. "Larry Air,
recent improvements:

166
00:06:33,463 --> 00:06:35,666
all chairs will have tray
tables,

167
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:37,930
not just first class."

168
00:06:38,017 --> 00:06:39,932
I feel like I'm flying on
the Concorde.

169
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:42,816
You can leave any time.
I'm fine to do this on my own.

170
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:45,000
How will I get the job
if I leave now though?

171
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:46,699
All right, everyone,

172
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:49,433
If you could please follow me,
we're ready to get started.

173
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:53,095
Thank you so much.

174
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,471
Well, it is so exciting
to see

175
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:59,082
how much interest there is
in Larry Air.

176
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,549
Oh, I should mention,
if anyone here is involved

177
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:03,565
in the class-action lawsuit
against Larry Air,

178
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,673
you are disqualified
from applying.

179
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:12,827
All right,
why don't we go around,

180
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:14,837
and I'll have each of you
state your name

181
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:17,274
and tell us what you consider
your biggest weakness.

182
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:19,233
Ooh!

183
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,323
Me? Um... Stevie Budd,

184
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,759
and um...

185
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:26,974
I'd say my biggest weakness
is...

186
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:30,167
that I'm disorganized.
Ooh, that's true.

187
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:35,336
- And, um, I'm indecisive.
- Yes.

188
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,279
- Uh... I also...
- Okay.

189
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,689
We just needed one. Next?

190
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:42,430
Hi. David Rose.

191
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:45,694
Would we consider loyalty
a weakness?

192
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:48,479
If not, I'm also really honest.

193
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:50,481
I'm just gonna put down
chatty.

194
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,309
- Okay.
- Hmph.

195
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,834
Well, she said there was
nothing she could do.

196
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:57,836
Apparently, I don't have
enough assets.

197
00:07:57,923 --> 00:07:59,708
Yeah, she said apparently

198
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:01,187
Johnny doesn't have enough
assets.

199
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,189
Yeah, and the problem is,
how do you get assets...

200
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:04,539
without the loan?

201
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:05,844
But the the problem is,

202
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:08,369
how do you get assets
without a loan?

203
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:11,023
Roland, you're not adding
anything to the sentence,

204
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,025
you're just repeating
what I said.

205
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:16,377
Anyway, I don't know how long
this will set us back, Moira.

206
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:20,076
Could be another year or two
before we make any headway.

207
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:22,513
Oh, surely there's some
penny-wise townsperson

208
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,211
with a hidden rainy-day
reservoir.

209
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:28,693
Well, you know, uh, I don't
wanna be the town gossip here,

210
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,696
but, uh, the other day,
I got a look at Bob's

211
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:34,253
financial statement
on his desk in the office,

212
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:37,446
and that garage is doing great!

213
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:39,471
Plus, he got plugs last year,
but...

214
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,705
you didn't hear that from me.

215
00:08:40,793 --> 00:08:41,981
You know, come to think
of it,

216
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:43,370
Gwen has been coming
to rehearsal

217
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,058
- in those fancy yoga clothes.
- Those are not cheap.

218
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:48,060
I know because I buy
the knockoffs,

219
00:08:48,147 --> 00:08:50,541
and they're not cheap.
Bob...

220
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:52,064
You know, he was very
interested

221
00:08:52,151 --> 00:08:54,197
in that bagel business
a while ago,

222
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,504
and this is a much stronger
idea.

223
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:57,635
Roland and I are having
dinner

224
00:08:57,722 --> 00:08:59,768
with Bob and Gwen tonight.

225
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:02,640
- Bob!
- Hey, folks.

226
00:09:02,727 --> 00:09:04,338
Bob!

227
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:06,296
Oh, look at you, Robert,

228
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:08,690
with the hides of a herd
of Holstein on your back.

229
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:09,910
Yeah.

230
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:12,856
Sorry, uh, I don't have time
to chat. Uh...

231
00:09:12,954 --> 00:09:15,057
I just had two cups of coffee,

232
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:17,611
uh, I don't wanna push my luck.

233
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:19,788
I mean, uh, these pants,

234
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:23,605
they take like a year
to unlace, so...

235
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:28,079
Rose's, I hope you like fish,

236
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,193
'cause I think we just reeled
in a big one.

237
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,852
Hey, Alexis. Another green
smoothie, no greens?

238
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:43,115
Um... yeah,
if you're making one.

239
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:45,335
No. I'm asking
if you want one.

240
00:09:45,422 --> 00:09:47,729
Okay, Twy, I didn't
like leave anything behind

241
00:09:47,816 --> 00:09:49,578
when I popped by earlier,
did I?

242
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,386
I don't think so, but if you
tell me what you lost,

243
00:09:52,473 --> 00:09:54,257
I can ask George if anyone
turned it in?

244
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,694
No, it's, it's nothing.
It's just a turtle.

245
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:59,113
- What?
- His name is Ted

246
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:01,042
and he's gone. And I can't
remember where I put him,

247
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,028
and I thought it was
in the motel,

248
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:04,047
but he could've like crawled
out of my purse

249
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:06,142
when I brought him
by the cafe earlier.

250
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:07,431
Okay.

251
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:10,621
Turtles are actually kind of
like huge health hazards,

252
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,643
so when did you last see him?

253
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:14,429
'Kay, it's been weeks.

254
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:17,098
But between the patchy Wi-Fi

255
00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:18,907
and like the ten-day
nature trips,

256
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:22,055
and me being alone here,
kind of feels like he left

257
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:23,981
the day that he flew
to the Galapagos.

258
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:25,737
The turtle flew
to the Galapagos?

259
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,073
No, Ted the turtle
is missing,

260
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:30,424
I am now talking about
my boyfriend Ted, Twy.

261
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:32,470
It'd be great if you could
keep up.

262
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:33,551
Right. Sorry.

263
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,728
The slowest animal on earth
escaped from me.

264
00:10:35,816 --> 00:10:37,873
That can't not be a bad sign.

265
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:39,139
My mom had a turtle dove

266
00:10:39,227 --> 00:10:41,258
that was eaten by her
ex-fiancé's snake.

267
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:43,975
- That was a bad sign.
- Oh my God.

268
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:45,852
And it happened on
Valentine's Day.

269
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:48,427
- Mm.
- And her fiancé was a Satanist.

270
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:51,660
I think you guys are just going
through a tough time.

271
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,249
But... who knows?

272
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:55,860
Maybe you'll be pleasantly
surprised

273
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,823
by how much closer this brings
the two of you.

274
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:00,297
And if it makes you feel
any better,

275
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:02,878
turtles actually thrive
out of captivity.

276
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,864
Thanks, Twy.

277
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:11,807
Oh, and if you do see Ted like
waddling around in the kitchen,

278
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:14,349
just feed him a carrot
and shoot me a text.

279
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:16,871
I hope you're joking.

280
00:11:17,118 --> 00:11:19,250
Me too, girl.
Love you!

281
00:11:24,637 --> 00:11:26,219
- Excuse me.
- Mm?

282
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:30,398
This baby behind me has been
crying for over an hour now

283
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:32,401
and I just can't take it
anymore.

284
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:34,099
You and me both.

285
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,801
I have shushed them thrice
at this point.

286
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:38,438
Now, here are your options:

287
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:41,312
I could either move those two
to the back of the plane,

288
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,095
or I could offer you
some complimentary alcohol

289
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:46,557
to make your flight
a little more bearable.

290
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,197
Okay. Thank you, David.

291
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:50,721
Thank you, Carol!

292
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:54,767
- That was a great example...
- Thank you!

293
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:57,771
...of what not to do.
David just reminded us

294
00:11:57,859 --> 00:12:00,914
of two touchstone policies
here at Larry Air:

295
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:02,314
no seat changes,

296
00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:03,957
and "complimentary"

297
00:12:04,045 --> 00:12:06,413
is not in our corporate
vocabulary.

298
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,050
But finger snaps for David!

299
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,126
- We don't... sSure.
- We don't... sSure.

300
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:16,852
Okay, I think it's time
to move on to the final round.

301
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:19,433
If I call your name,
please stand up.

302
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:23,430
Rupinder Pimms,
Tracey Mickleson,

303
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:26,403
Felix Ng, and David Rose.

304
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:28,453
- Fuck yes!
- I regret to inform you,

305
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,050
you will not be asked
to continue the process.

306
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:33,466
This is so embarrassing.

307
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:35,378
I thought you said David Rose.

308
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:36,637
I did.

309
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:39,768
Too bad they didn't have
a branzino to de-bone

310
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:41,139
- because you would've got this.
- Hmm...

311
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,944
Yeah, hi, Carol?
Uh, it's just that some of us

312
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,208
drove some of the other
applicants here,

313
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:47,656
so it might just be easier

314
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:50,181
if we all just moved forward
into the next round.

315
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:52,906
I think it's best
if you wait in the hall.

316
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:54,589
Okay.

317
00:12:59,286 --> 00:13:01,399
I'll be taking some of these
complimentary peanuts then.

318
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:02,584
Oh, as I pointed out,

319
00:13:02,672 --> 00:13:04,577
nothing is complimentary
on Larry Air.

320
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:06,797
I'm taking the peanuts,
Carol!

321
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:12,109
Okay, moving on...

322
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:23,497
Well, hopefully,
Gwen will be here soon.

323
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:25,368
Oh, we don't have to wait
for Gwen.

324
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:27,765
Oh, I think we do. It uh...

325
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:29,681
gives us more time to talk.

326
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,599
How often do good friends get
a chance to sit around and, uh,

327
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:35,722
and talk?
Right!

328
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,074
And, you know, I didn't get
a chance to tell you before,

329
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:42,618
but that is one snazzy outfit.
I mean...

330
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:45,708
Somebody... somebody's
got some money to burn.

331
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:47,358
Take it easy, Roland.

332
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:49,426
- Well...
- Let's not embarrass the man.

333
00:13:49,514 --> 00:13:53,288
He obviously knows what
his money can do for him.

334
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,115
This is so exciting!

335
00:13:55,203 --> 00:13:57,117
I feel like I'm a Wolf
of Wall Street.

336
00:13:57,205 --> 00:13:59,182
Good... then let's go get
our lamb.

337
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,796
Oh, are we having lamb?

338
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:03,537
No, just my Sloppy Jocelyns.

339
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,202
Hope you're hungry, Bob.

340
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,510
Speaking of yummy
opportunities.

341
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:11,028
John, were you able to return
Bill and Melinda's call today

342
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,031
about the hmm hmm-hmm?

343
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,263
Well, you know, Moira,
we're not supposed to be

344
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:16,919
discussing investment
opportunities at the table,

345
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:19,420
no matter how lucrative
they might be.

346
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:21,697
But you know what the Gateses
are like -

347
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:23,438
Bill and Melinda.

348
00:14:23,526 --> 00:14:25,702
You know, they're expecting
your call about...

349
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,878
the investment.

350
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,404
- Yeah.
- Wow! You know Bill Gates?

351
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:32,839
Oh, who doesn't?
But you're right, Bob,

352
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:34,580
why gild their lilies

353
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,836
when there might be someone
right under our noses

354
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:39,750
looking for a lucrative venture?

355
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,753
Well, I... look, I...

356
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:43,992
I might as well just come clean:

357
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,938
Gwen's not coming.

358
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:47,741
Let's eat.

359
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:49,713
Yeah, she, uh, she left me.

360
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:54,019
I'm sorry, it's just all this,
all this money talk,

361
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:55,664
and all I can think about

362
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:58,450
is how much I spent on
this suit.

363
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:00,519
Gwen, she told me, you know,

364
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:02,565
she said, "I like bad boys,"

365
00:15:02,862 --> 00:15:05,053
and now she's holed up
with our minister.

366
00:15:05,141 --> 00:15:08,956
She was bragging about
a religious experience.

367
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:11,650
Perhaps there's an upside
to all this,

368
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:13,697
fiscally speaking.
Hmm!

369
00:15:16,318 --> 00:15:18,569
Oh no, no.

370
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:23,455
Listen, uh, Johnny,
I, I hate to ask,

371
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:25,283
but, uh, you just seem to have

372
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,061
so many, uh, high-profile
friends.

373
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:30,554
Do you think one of them
might be open to...

374
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:32,165
cutting me a loan?

375
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:35,082
See, Gwen and Parson Jim,
they're...

376
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:37,017
they're after the house.

377
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:39,526
Mm.

378
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:47,987
So, are you just never gonna
talk to me ever again?

379
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:49,632
I asked you to roll up
the window in the car.

380
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,119
The highway smelled like manure.

381
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,146
Okay. It just seems like
you're upset.

382
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:54,455
Not upset.

383
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:56,414
Just didn't feel like talking
in the car. So.

384
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:57,974
Okay.

385
00:15:58,062 --> 00:16:00,151
Did Carol embarrass herself

386
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,110
by sending me away
in front of everybody?

387
00:16:02,322 --> 00:16:03,536
Absolutely.

388
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:06,912
Was the entire group shocked
by that decision?

389
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:09,242
Seemed like it based on
some people's faces.

390
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:11,244
Now ask me if I care.

391
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:13,776
- Do you care...
- Don't care! I don't care!

392
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:18,169
You are such a sore loser.

393
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:19,601
I am not!

394
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:22,715
I'm not. It's just, do you
really wanna work for a place

395
00:16:22,803 --> 00:16:25,026
that clearly doesn't know
what they're doing?

396
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,990
Oh, well, they really want me
to work for them,

397
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,221
so I have to trust that they
do know what they're doing.

398
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:35,950
- Okay.
- Admit it.

399
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,064
I'm more qualified than you.

400
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:41,918
- Fine.
- Admit it.

401
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:43,475
You're more qualified
than me.

402
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,109
- Thank you!
- Now...

403
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:48,377
let's see what exciting new
job opportunities await you

404
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,979
in your new career
as an airline hostess.

405
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:52,198
Give me that! Give it!

406
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:54,884
I am so embarrassed for you!

407
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:58,160
Now, I would love to use one
of Larry Air's

408
00:16:58,248 --> 00:17:01,033
"completely private"
new paid toilets.

409
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,545
I don't know why they have
to stress "completely private."

410
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:05,346
Get out! Get out!

411
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:08,294
No.

412
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:13,272
Ugh!

413
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,867
Ted! Dinner's ready!

414
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:21,184
Ugh!

415
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,823
- Alexis Rose?
- Yes?

416
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:28,844
Mr. Mullens has arranged
a limo for you.

417
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:30,557
If you could please come
with me.

418
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,925
How do I know this isn't like
an abduction or something?

419
00:17:33,013 --> 00:17:34,928
It's not an abduction.

420
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:37,287
You didn't blink.
I believe you.

421
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:39,202
Um, okay, I'll be out in five.

422
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:49,952
Good evening, Ms. Rose.

423
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,185
The other member of your party
has already been seated.

424
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:56,951
<i>♪ I tell myself that I'm... ♪</i>

425
00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:01,485
<i>♪ So lucky ♪</i>

426
00:18:01,572 --> 00:18:03,792
<i>♪ To be loving you ♪</i>

427
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:05,402
<i> Oh, hi. </i>

428
00:18:05,489 --> 00:18:07,706
Ted! What is this?

429
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:09,320
<i>Well, I couldn't let
our anniversary go</i>

430
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:10,473
<i>without a celebration.</i>

431
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:11,926
<i>Just because we're not in
the same city</i>

432
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:13,630
<i>doesn't mean that we can't go
on a date.</i>

433
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,128
And you're wearing
the little tie

434
00:18:15,216 --> 00:18:17,761
with your short-sleeved shirt.
My little Galapo-guy.

435
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:19,973
<i>Yeah, it's actually really
hot here,</i>

436
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:22,580
<i>so the bottom half is just my
bathing suit and flip-flops.</i>

437
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,683
Ted! More about your
bottom half, please!

438
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:28,347
<i>Twyla's not standing right
behind you, is she?</i>

439
00:18:29,165 --> 00:18:30,636
Hi, Ted.

440
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:32,258
<i>Twyla, again,</i>

441
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:33,894
<i>I can't thank you enough
for making this happen.</i>

442
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,520
Um, I can lock up
if you wanna go, Twy.

443
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:38,261
Oh, someone has to serve you
dinner.

444
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:41,368
But don't worry,
I'll stay out of your way.

445
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:46,530
<i>Alexis, I'm sorry for
dropping the ball on our calls.</i>

446
00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:48,662
<i>I thought that we would have
Wi-Fi on the trip</i>

447
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:50,698
<i>and we didn't, so...
the rest of the team</i>

448
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:52,623
<i>just had to listen to me talk
about you for seven days.</i>

449
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,329
In fact, they actually named
the new fly "Alexis."

450
00:18:56,448 --> 00:18:58,339
The fly that mates
with itself?

451
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,457
<i>Yeah, I think the important
thing is that, now,</i>

452
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:03,808
<i>I have a little Alexis here
with me,</i>

453
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:05,419
<i>just buzzing around.</i>

454
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:08,596
I'm just like so happy
to see your face.

455
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,130
Me too.

456
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:13,122
- <i>♪ So lucky ♪</i>
- Boop!

457
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:14,732
- Boop!
- <i>♪ To be loving you ♪</i>

458
00:19:25,452 --> 00:19:27,657
Okay, John, I'm going to
throw another name at you:

459
00:19:27,745 --> 00:19:29,965
Ronnie. Owns her own business,
no kids.

460
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:32,663
Clearly doesn't spend any money
on herself.

461
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,840
I appreciate the enthusiasm,
Moira, but uh...

462
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:38,538
I just got off the phone
with Betty Terkstra.

463
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:40,434
She sold the place.

464
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:42,451
No, John!

465
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,239
I'll keep an eye open
for a less pricey property,

466
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:46,694
but, uh, without Stevie,

467
00:19:46,782 --> 00:19:48,330
I think we're in a bit
of a bind.

468
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:50,777
Oh, John, hold me.

469
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:53,320
Good is coming, it has to.

470
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:01,561
Hello, Johnny!

471
00:20:01,648 --> 00:20:03,586
Look, I appreciate
the gesture, guys,

472
00:20:03,674 --> 00:20:06,068
but, uh, this is not a good
night for champagne.

473
00:20:06,262 --> 00:20:08,046
Oh, speak for yourself, John.

474
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:11,491
Oh good, you're lying down!
We have big news.

475
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:14,626
If you're referring to the
bath-time video Gwen posted...

476
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,934
N-no, n-no, it's...
it's not that exciting.

477
00:20:17,022 --> 00:20:18,937
No, um...

478
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:21,571
Well, we...

479
00:20:22,882 --> 00:20:25,623
- BOUGHT THE MOTEL!
- What?!

480
00:20:25,718 --> 00:20:28,544
Yeah, we took out a second
mortgage on our house.

481
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:31,546
Yeah. After what went down
at dinner,

482
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:33,278
Joc and I started talking,
and we figured,

483
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:36,242
well, if it's good enough
for Bill Gates to invest in,

484
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,555
it's, uh, good enough for us
to invest in.

485
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:40,383
Roland, we don't actually
know...

486
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,646
I'm, I'm sorry,
I'm, I'm not comprehending.

487
00:20:43,765 --> 00:20:45,506
We...

488
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:48,039
are buying into the business.

489
00:20:48,703 --> 00:20:51,504
Say hello to your new
business partners.

490
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:54,951
Oh, well, if that's not cause
for alcohol

491
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,485
I don't know what is.

492
00:20:56,573 --> 00:20:58,618
So, we have the motel?

493
00:20:58,705 --> 00:20:59,973
We sure do.

494
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:02,411
Now, first order of business,

495
00:21:02,646 --> 00:21:04,257
we need name tags.

496
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:09,856
I don't believe this!
Roland, we will make this work.

497
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:11,063
- Yes.
- We'll make it work.

498
00:21:11,151 --> 00:21:13,804
- Thank you. Thank you, Roland.
- All right.

499
00:21:16,616 --> 00:21:18,485
Why is there a turtle
on the floor?

500
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:20,294
Alexis!

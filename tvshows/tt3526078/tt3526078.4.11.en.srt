1
00:00:03,552 --> 00:00:04,742
David,

2
00:00:04,782 --> 00:00:08,527
Stevie is just now opening
the Rose Apothecary products

3
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:10,385
we ordered for the motel.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,610
Okay, good, you're welcome.

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,446
Well, it would be good
if the order had arrived

6
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:17,149
when it was supposed
to arrive, last week.

7
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:18,812
All right, so it got held up.

8
00:00:18,837 --> 00:00:21,186
What possible difference
could one week make?

9
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,588
We made sure to order those products

10
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:26,328
- in time for the rollout.
- What rollout?

11
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:28,820
The Rosebud Motel rollout.

12
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:32,006
New name, new branding,
flowers in all the rooms.

13
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,874
New custom towels, all
part of the rollout.

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,772
- Um, who taught you rollout?
- May have been me. Sorry.

15
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:42,327
You know, other than
your little blunder,

16
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:43,741
it would've been a flawless rollout.

17
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:46,100
Okay, you really need
to stop saying rollout.

18
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,750
David, delivery dates are important,

19
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:50,908
when it comes to client loyalty.

20
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:53,906
Okay, do I need to remind you that

21
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:55,832
I'm the one doing you the favour?

22
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:58,401
Accessorizing motel bathrooms

23
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:00,759
is not what I would call
on-brand for the store.

24
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,312
So, if you would like
to pull the account,

25
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:04,789
you can pull the account.

26
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,765
Well I can't pull the account,

27
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,351
because it's part of the rollout.

28
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:13,038
So, I may be looking elsewhere

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,577
when it comes time
for the pop-out store.

30
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,512
Okay. He meant pop-up store, right?

31
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,647
Honestly, David, it
took him like 2 weeks

32
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,867
to learn rollout, so...

33
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:29,288

34
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,029
It's just that we don't want
people adopting sad dogs.

35
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:35,779
You know, like singles are sad enough,

36
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,729
so we want the puppies to be happy,

37
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,148
and fun, and flirty.

38
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:41,710
Yeah, I got that note in your email,

39
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:47,449
uh, but, as you know,
these are rescue dogs so...

40
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,718
it's kinda hard to guarantee fun.

41
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,276
She's a little cutie!

42
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,178
That's actually a he,

43
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,339
and I think he might
already be spoken for?

44
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,784
But the event's like a week away.

45
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:02,087
I know, I just, I happened to show

46
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,689
some of these little rascals to Heather,

47
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,692
and, and she saw this guy,
and wanted to adopt him.

48
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:11,430
So, we're just kind of in the
process of making that happen,

49
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,231
for her.

50
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:16,168
- Hmm. Wow, love that for her.
- Alexis?

51
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:19,471
Oh, Theodore, back for another
meeting of the animals, I see.

52
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,739
Hello, Mrs. Rose.

53
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:24,309
You know you two are
lovely little freaks.

54
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:29,147
In this digital day of
discontented disconnection,

55
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,384
you two still manage to
do things face-to-face,

56
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,339
like people from before your time.

57
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:37,761
Hmm. We were just finishing up.

58
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,403
Oh, I'll-I'll just see you at
the volunteers' meeting, then?

59
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,467
Um, you know what, you
don't have to come to that.

60
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,063
But, thank you for all
of your help with this.

61
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,866
Okay, uh, okay sure.

62
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,988
Well, let me know if
you need anything else.

63
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:54,245
- You got my number, obviously.
- Yes, I do, thank you.

64
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:56,916
- Bye, Mrs. Rose.
- Bye.

65
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,925
See you again soon, I'm sure.

66
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:05,870
Safe to say our animal-loving
singles will be well placated.

67
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,042
Can I help you with something?

68
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:09,867
Yes! Yes.

69
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:12,357
That nudnick at the curling
rink just informed me

70
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,359
that they'll no longer
be able to accommodate

71
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,095
our Lover's Messy
Sloppy Joe Eat-a-Thon.

72
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,097
I'm afraid you have to
secure us another venue.

73
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,105
Okay, well, can't you do it?

74
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,135
N... alas! Your co-chair will
be busy getting herself out

75
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,636
of jury duty today.

76
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:28,972
Okay, then I will just add
that to the immense list

77
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:30,761
of things that I have
to do this morning.

78
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:34,213
Alexis, you know me,
I'm not one to overstep,

79
00:03:34,238 --> 00:03:37,182
But, perhaps you might be able to strike

80
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:38,487
a few more to-do's off that list

81
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:40,913
if you and Ted spend a little less time

82
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:42,905
fussing over this canine auction.

83
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,284
It's a puppy adoption, and we're done.

84
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,612
Planning. So, thank you.

85
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:55,411
Hey.

86
00:03:55,722 --> 00:03:58,770
Wow! Looking very nice, Stevie.

87
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,675
Yeah, thanks, except I
think I have to go home now.

88
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,339
Really? What's going on?

89
00:04:03,364 --> 00:04:07,347
Uh, nothing to be concerned
about, just... this.

90
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,305
Oh my god! What happened?

91
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,616
I don't know it's like an
allergic reaction or something.

92
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,952
Did we change our laundry detergent?

93
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,620
No, what have you
been doing differently?

94
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:19,816
Nothing, just rolling things
out, like you asked me to.

95
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:21,613
Could be, could be an insect bite.

96
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,514
It's all the way up my arms.

97
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:27,399
Well, Stevie, stop! What are you doing?

98
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,934
Uh I know it's for the guests,

99
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,863
but it's like really good
stuff, and this is extra.

100
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:34,511
How long have you been using that?

101
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:35,847
This morning.

102
00:04:35,872 --> 00:04:38,355
Before or after your
arm started itching?

103
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:40,802
After, definitely after.

104
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,194
Oh, okay.

105
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:44,516
I mean, I might've tried a little bit

106
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,886
when I was unpacking the box, but...

107
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,830
- my skin gets real dry in here.
- It's the lotion.

108
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,081
What?

109
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:52,316
David's lotion is giving you the rash!

110
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,831
No, I don't think it's the lotion.

111
00:04:53,856 --> 00:04:55,690
And you know what? I'm not surprised!

112
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:58,558
Because he gets a lot
of this stuff from farms,

113
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,011
and who knows where,

114
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:02,403
and you don't know what's
in these natural products!

115
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,402
Stevie, why do you keep doing that?

116
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,315
I don't know, okay! It
might be causing the rash,

117
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,909
but it's also the only thing
that's making it feel better.

118
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:10,777
Okay, well we have to
now go and see David.

119
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,568
No, I think it's a better
idea that I just go home.

120
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:15,727
After we handle this!

121
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:18,386
This is the last thing we need
in the middle of a rollout!

122
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:23,308
Okay, if I could just
get everyone to be,

123
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,466
like, quiet for a minute?

124
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,949
C-help. Okay.

125
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:31,652
Hey! Hey.

126
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:36,292
Um, welcome to the first
official volunteer meeting.

127
00:05:36,317 --> 00:05:39,681
I, of course, am your
co-chair, Alexis Rose.

128
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,507
Um, I think this is
gonna be a very fun week.

129
00:05:43,622 --> 00:05:46,156
But, as of right now,
it's less than ideal.

130
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:49,089
Um, I don't wanna add
to anyone's stress,

131
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:51,215
but we just lost the curling club.

132
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,639
- Oh...
- Bottom line, we need a new venue,

133
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:57,988
so if everyone can just
like, ask around? Please.

134
00:05:58,013 --> 00:05:59,813
I might have a place.

135
00:06:02,393 --> 00:06:04,261
Oh my god!

136
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:07,261
Okay, um, everyone take a Hot 5.

137
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:10,745
And oh, for those of you
asking about the t-shirts, yes,

138
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,370
they are supposed to be tight.

139
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,729
This is Singles Week,
everyone is fair game.

140
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:15,988
Okay?

141
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,245
- Hi!
- Hi.

142
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,941
What are you doing back?

143
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,152
Oh well, I uh, I don't
know if you heard,

144
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,687
but I'm gonna have a
little brother soon,

145
00:06:25,712 --> 00:06:28,197
- so yeah, I couldn't miss that.
- Um, yes, congratulations.

146
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,689
And, are you serious about
having a venue for me?

147
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:33,014
Because that would be... amazing.

148
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,605
Happy to loan out the barn,

149
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,870
- if it can be cleaned up in time.
- What happened?

150
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:39,241
Oh, I asked a friend of
mine to keep an eye on it

151
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,503
while I was away, and
musta slipped her mind.

152
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,661
It didn't slip my mind,
I just like, didn't go.

153
00:06:46,891 --> 00:06:48,206
Is it bad?

154
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:51,186
Yeah, a nice little home
for a family of raccoons.

155
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,356
I had to evict them, though,
and they didn't go quietly.

156
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,548
Okay. You are literally
saving my life right now.

157
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,425
I feel like I should help you clean,

158
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,484
or like, water the plants, or something.

159
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:01,916
I won't turn down the help,

160
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:03,452
but you don't have to
worry about the plants,

161
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:05,393
they are very, very dead.

162
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:08,818
Mutt, you're making me
feel partially responsible.

163
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,346
Moira Rose.

164
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:19,994
Moira! Moira!

165
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:22,659
Jocelyn,

166
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:26,625
I see you've been lassoed into
the judicial process as well.

167
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,546
Finally!

168
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,534
I'm surprised to see you here, though.

169
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,182
I know, right?

170
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:34,807
You've served so many times already!

171
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:39,024
I mean you had to miss
the Jazzagals Luau Luncheon

172
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,174
because of that hung
jury, and then before that,

173
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,361
you and Johnny got caught
in that criminal trial

174
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,463
and couldn't make it
to the Seafood Potluck.

175
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:48,169
Mmhmm. What can I say?

176
00:07:48,194 --> 00:07:50,495
I'm a stand-out in the jury box.

177
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,550
But shame on them for summoning
a woman in your condition.

178
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:56,136
Oh no, I've been
waiting for this moment.

179
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:58,443
Apparently, if they call your number,

180
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,284
you get to stand in front of a judge!

181
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:02,983
I feel like I'm on "The Voice"!

182
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:06,161
Ooh, as seductive as
that sounds, no thank you.

183
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,986
With Singles Week
just around the corner,

184
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,268
my services are desperately
needed elsewhere.

185
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:13,491
- Number 23!
- Oh my god! That's me!

186
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:15,837
Number 40, number 75!

187
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,429
Uh oh, that's me.

188
00:08:19,227 --> 00:08:22,028
Jocelyn, you're about
to witness a master class

189
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:24,287
in judicatory persuasion.

190
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:31,581
Hello?

191
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:33,804
Hello?

192
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,643
No one at the counter!

193
00:08:37,944 --> 00:08:40,011
Who runs a business like this?

194
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:42,536
Anyone could just walk
in here and shoplift.

195
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:45,262
Okay, nobody's just walking
in here and shoplifting.

196
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:47,587
David! Your face!

197
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:50,004
I know my face! I know my face!

198
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,829
It's a... it's a heat rash or something!

199
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,465
I look like the Phantom of the Opera!

200
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,457
Well, you can't greet
customers with that face!

201
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:56,782
You don't think I know that?

202
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:58,240
I don't have much choice!

203
00:08:58,265 --> 00:09:00,549
Patrick's at some business seminar,

204
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,840
I don't really know, because
I wasn't really listening.

205
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,322
Stevie, show him your arms.

206
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:07,422
- Thought you'd never ask!
- Oh my god!

207
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,813
What happened to your arms?

208
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:10,267
Same thing that happened to your face!

209
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:13,263
- What?
- Your Dad thinks it's your moisturizer.

210
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:15,509
Okay, that's impossible.

211
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:17,603
I've been using this moisturizer

212
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:19,705
- every day for 3 months.
- Oh.

213
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:22,634
Although, this is a new batch.

214
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:25,907
And we've already sold
half the stock. Oh my god!

215
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,543
See? I knew it!

216
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:30,573
David, we have a problem.
We have a big problem.

217
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:31,817
You could be sued!

218
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:33,343
- What?
- For retail negligence.

219
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:34,734
Stevie, show him your arms again.

220
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:37,129
- I don't want to show him my arms.
- I don't wanna see her arms again.

221
00:09:37,154 --> 00:09:39,088
You realize you're gonna
have to talk to Patrick

222
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:41,224
and tell him that you two
are gonna have to take a bit

223
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:43,418
of a breather when it... comes to...

224
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:45,051
- Ew!
- You know, could be contagious.

225
00:09:45,076 --> 00:09:47,590
- Oh my god!
- Yeah, and here you were this morning,

226
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:50,300
acting like you were doing
us a favour with the rollout.

227
00:09:50,325 --> 00:09:52,559
Okay, this is one of our
best-selling products.

228
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:54,995
Well, we're gonna have
to roll it back in.

229
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,549
And stop touching your face!

230
00:09:56,574 --> 00:09:58,374
You stop touching your face!

231
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:01,624
Okay, this is definitely smaller

232
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:03,092
than the curling rink.

233
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:04,805
Well, it sounds like
you've been really busy

234
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:06,729
- puttin' this thing together.
- Yeah.

235
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,753
What's happened since
you and Tallahassee

236
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:11,277
left on your pine-cone journey?

237
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:13,870
It's uh, Tennessee, and I'm
pretty sure you know that,

238
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:17,440
- and that ended a while ago.
- Oh no!

239
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:21,035
I totally thought she
was like, the one for you.

240
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:23,034
We called it off the day we arrived.

241
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:25,909
She's married to Moonshine
now, the owner of the cone form.

242
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:29,161
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- That trip was a disaster.

243
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:30,562
Compass broke halfway there,

244
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,564
we ended up following a star for 2 days.

245
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,900
Anyway, by the time we
got there, we sat down

246
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,792
and uh, spoke our truths.

247
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,449
Pretty freeing.

248
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:41,173
That day I picked 700 cones!

249
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,371
Hmm, is that like a lot of cones?

250
00:10:44,396 --> 00:10:47,012
Well, Moonshine and his daughter, Petal,

251
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,182
said it was the biggest
one-day haul they'd ever seen.

252
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,690
They gave me the Cone of Achievement,

253
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:53,660
which allowed me to
take 2 showers that week.

254
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:57,856
- Speaking of showers,
- Ugh! No!

255
00:10:58,137 --> 00:10:59,603
This can't happen,

256
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:01,981
I have like 50 zillion
things to do today.

257
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:04,407
Ooh, well, if only helping
me clean was one of 'em.

258
00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:05,770
Ugh!

259
00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:08,094
I can crack open a bottle of cone wine?

260
00:11:08,272 --> 00:11:09,817
Feeling risky?

261
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:13,517
Ugh, fine. Um, no.

262
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:16,377
Uh... fine. No.

263
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:19,903
Okay, but um, like just one.

264
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:26,705
Welcome to jury selection.

265
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,897
The case you would be asked to decide

266
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,762
is a misdemeanor embezzlement charge

267
00:11:31,787 --> 00:11:36,289
levied by the owners of Tom
and Marge's Magic and Fun Shop,

268
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:39,721
against their business
manager, Mr. Albert Percy.

269
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:41,947
Embezzlement, no, no, no, no.

270
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:43,614
I've seen this movie before.

271
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,287
It is your responsibility
to notify the court

272
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:48,848
of anything you've seen or heard,

273
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:51,206
that may impact on your ability

274
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:53,973
to be a fair and impartial juror.

275
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:56,266
Moira, this sounds like
what happened to your family.

276
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,262
- This could be your out.
- Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

277
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:02,015
A man needs to be brought to justice.

278
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,673
Yeah.

279
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:09,780
So we're back to the generic brand.

280
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:10,871
Well gang,

281
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,095
Just about time for me to clock out.

282
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,652
I gotta tell you two,

283
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:17,144
this timesheet you have
is really complicated.

284
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,036
By the time I finished filling it out,

285
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:20,660
I was already into overtime.

286
00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:23,293
So do you guys have an
overtime sheet I can fill out?

287
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,172
Kinda busy in here, Roland.

288
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:29,598
Whoa. Stevie! Geez! Yowzer!

289
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:32,315
It's just a reaction
to David's moisturizer.

290
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,903
Well, boy, leave it
to Stevie to get a rash

291
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:37,793
from a moisturizer
when she's sitting right

292
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:41,012
- next to poison oak.
- What poison oak?

293
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:42,436
Excuse me?

294
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,254
Well, right here. It's uh...

295
00:12:44,425 --> 00:12:47,082
- poison oak in that vase there.
- What?

296
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:50,356
Where did you get
those flowers, Mr. Rose?

297
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:54,184
Well, I talked to a few
florists, and then I...

298
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:57,977
decided it was more
authentic and... economical,

299
00:12:58,002 --> 00:13:01,074
if I just went out
back and... picked some.

300
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:03,957
Uh, correct me if I'm
wrong here, Johnny,

301
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:07,417
but I don't think poison
oak is that expensive.

302
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:09,542
I didn't know it was poison oak!

303
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:10,993
- Mmhmm.
- Wait a second,

304
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:12,864
if you picked them, then how
come you don't have the rash?

305
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:14,824
Well, I was wearing gardening gloves.

306
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:17,060
Okay, look, I'd love to stand
around and help you guys,

307
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:19,987
but I'm already sneaking
into double overtime here, so,

308
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:21,812
I'm off.

309
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:25,676
So... someone's gonna have
to tell David before he...

310
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:27,879
takes it all back.

311
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:30,547
No offense, Mr. Rose,
but I'm pretty sure

312
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:33,346
that someone is not going to be me.

313
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,791
Ma'am, can you assure
my client and the Court,

314
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,537
that you would, to the
best of your ability,

315
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:41,961
uphold the law if
selected for jury duty?

316
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:44,260
Affirmative. Mmhmm.

317
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,199
Do you have any life experiences similar

318
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:47,667
to the facts of this case,

319
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:49,463
that might affect your judgment?

320
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:55,608
Well, there was that
summer that Jimmy Smits

321
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:58,645
stole my heart on stage in
a workshop-only production

322
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,213
of "An Officer and a Gentleman".

323
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:03,400
I suppose that might be
called emotional embezzlement?

324
00:14:03,455 --> 00:14:06,219
- So your answer is no.
- To what?

325
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:10,149
Juror 75, you were asked if
you had any personal conflicts

326
00:14:10,174 --> 00:14:12,992
that might affect your
judgments of this case.

327
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,862
I don't know these people.
I don't know these people.

328
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:19,555
The fact that my own world
was ripped out from under me,

329
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,438
by someone like this
prick of a prestidigitator?

330
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,290
I should think would help
the court in the quest

331
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:27,650
to make a fair judgment.

332
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,744
- May I approach the bench, please?
- No, you may not.

333
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:35,238
The Court thanks and
excuses Prospective Juror 75.

334
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,957
Jocelyn, for the sake of that woman,

335
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,269
you must push for the maximum sentence!

336
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:48,161
- Your Honor!
- Hold on.

337
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,629
You two know each other?

338
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:51,631
Not really, we just got
to talking on the way in.

339
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:53,500
I... I wouldn't say we were close.

340
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:58,037
All right, I'm dismissing
both Juror 75 and Juror 23.

341
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,106
Mother.

342
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:02,509
This is the farthest I've ever gone!

343
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,880
It sounds like it's
actually raining harder.

344
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:11,218
So just take the day
off, like old time's sake.

345
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:14,015
Um, I am a college graduate, Mutt.

346
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:15,789
Singles Week is not community service,

347
00:15:15,857 --> 00:15:17,791
it's actually very important to me.

348
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:20,126
And I respect that.

349
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:23,796
So, will you be
participating in Singles Week?

350
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:25,698
Ugh. No, I'm trying to like,

351
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:28,773
learn from my mistakes
before making any new ones.

352
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,472
Think it's funny, you
bringing people together,

353
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:36,053
- and, here we are, still single.
- Hmm.

354
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,513
Makes you wonder if it's us?

355
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:44,217
- What is happening?
- I don't know,

356
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:46,853
I just thought we were
here, it's raining,

357
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:48,688
felt like nothing had changed.

358
00:15:48,713 --> 00:15:51,452
Yeah, I can see how you
would make that leap,

359
00:15:51,477 --> 00:15:54,745
but things have changed for me.

360
00:15:57,015 --> 00:15:58,570
That's cool.

361
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,035
We did have some fun in here, though.

362
00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:04,742
Yeah, we did.

363
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,538
You were quite the heartbreaker.

364
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:09,601
Yeah.

365
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:13,374
Not like, super proud of that, but...

366
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:17,550
Um, so when you and
Tallahassee had your talk,

367
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:20,249
you said it was... freeing.

368
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:23,289
Saying something you've
kept hidden, out loud?

369
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:24,724
Yeah, it was pretty freeing.

370
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:26,559
Though, in our case,
it was mostly swears

371
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:29,054
and we didn't talk for a week,
but it was worth it in the end.

372
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,364
Who knows where I'd
be right now if I just

373
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:33,929
didn't tell her how I felt. Hmm.

374
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:39,238
Yeah.

375
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,365
I think I need to leave.

376
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:44,068
It's still raining!

377
00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:46,112
Yeah, I know, I know, there's um,

378
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,826
there's like something I need to do.

379
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:49,949
But thank you for the talk,

380
00:16:49,952 --> 00:16:51,484
and for finishing up cleaning,

381
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:53,543
because I'm obviously
not gonna help with that.

382
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:56,138
You're a good one, Mutt.

383
00:17:02,757 --> 00:17:04,390
Okay, bye.

384
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,922
Okay, well I don't know what
to tell you, Brenda, I'm rashy!

385
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,725
Rashy!

386
00:17:12,206 --> 00:17:15,254
Yeah, the batch must be
contaminated or something,

387
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,847
it's like, some, some
cream-borne virus!

388
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:20,913
Yes, it's the cream.

389
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,883
My skin is normally fresh,
and dewy, and blemish-free.

390
00:17:25,662 --> 00:17:27,787
Well, I've already sold half the stock!

391
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,400
Okay, can you hold for a sec?

392
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,556
What now?

393
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:34,170
Oh, I'm just dropping by, you know.

394
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:37,661
Oh, place looks great,
really uh, really shaping up.

395
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,609
Yeah, I'm just on the
phone with the vendor

396
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:42,559
that sold us the
infectious moisturizer, so,

397
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:45,129
Well, does the vendor
have a sense of humor,

398
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:48,084
because this is a good one!

399
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:50,453
Remember the conversation
we were having this morning

400
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:53,079
about you know, the rash?

401
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,879
Well, it turns out it
wasn't the moisturizer,

402
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:59,285
it was poison oak.

403
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:07,494
Brenda, can I call you back?

404
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,012
You know, it seems
poison oak accidentally

405
00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:15,592
found its way into the floral
arrangements at the motel.

406
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,771
How did that happen?

407
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,506
I don't know.

408
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:21,975
I don't know how it
happened. I think someone,

409
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:24,844
someone must've thought
it was a beautiful plant.

410
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,747
Mmhmm. You did this, didn't you?

411
00:18:28,018 --> 00:18:29,607
Well...

412
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:33,043
you, yourself must've thought
it was a pretty flower,

413
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:34,821
or you wouldn't have put
your whole face in it!

414
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,757
I'm sorry for touching
my nose to a flower!

415
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,292
I just went all Gordon Ramsey

416
00:18:39,294 --> 00:18:41,394
on one of my most important vendors!

417
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:43,129
I basically told her,

418
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:45,454
her product was like a jar of Ebola!

419
00:18:45,888 --> 00:18:48,801
So, this is uh, not a good time

420
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:51,093
to talk about future orders.

421
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:53,218
We will be canceling your account.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

423
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,817
Just be outgoing, be open,

424
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:06,576
and show them your best self.

425
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:11,357
And don't worry, I'll be
vetting everyone in advance.

426
00:19:14,796 --> 00:19:17,330
- Hi.
- Hi.

427
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,255
How long have you been standing there?

428
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,146
Um, long enough.

429
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:24,570
Yeah, I was just giving
them a little pup talk.

430
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:29,509
Okay, Ted, I have a few things to say,

431
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:31,371
and I need you just to listen.

432
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:33,112
Okay, uh, is it about
the puppies though,

433
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:34,580
just because they're
kinda fragile right now,

434
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,415
so maybe we should go in the other room.

435
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,865
- It's not about the puppies.
- Oh, okay, good.

436
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay. So as you know,

437
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:47,060
Singles Week has been taking
up a lot of my time, um,

438
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,873
because this could be like, a
big step forward in my career,

439
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,030
and generally speaking,

440
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:53,232
this is like a very cute look for me.

441
00:19:53,257 --> 00:19:56,325
- Okay.
- Okay... not finished yet.

442
00:19:56,552 --> 00:19:59,806
The problem is, I've been having um,

443
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:03,209
a hard time focusing on this
exciting career opportunity

444
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:05,388
because my mind has been elsewhere.

445
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,547
Oh, I just assumed that's
how you always work.

446
00:20:07,732 --> 00:20:09,733
Thank you, Ted, but this is different.

447
00:20:12,954 --> 00:20:14,398
I love you.

448
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:16,867
I'm in love with you.

449
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:20,787
And, I know I really don't have
any right to say that to you.

450
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:23,709
And also, I know you're
in a relationship, um,

451
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:25,773
and I'm happy for you, I really am,

452
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:28,000
I just feel like if I
didn't tell you how I felt,

453
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:30,503
I would literally go insane.

454
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:35,045
You're the sweetest man I've ever known.

455
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,709
And... that's it.

456
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:48,514
Wow, I didn't... I
don't know what to say.

457
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,357
You don't have to say anything.

458
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,768
Um, but maybe I could take
a puppy home for the night.

459
00:20:55,824 --> 00:20:59,265
- You know I can't let you do that.
- Yeah, no. That's no problem.

460
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,200
Um, I was just thinking
if there was like,

461
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:03,636
a particularly runty one, like Cindy,

462
00:21:03,704 --> 00:21:06,285
or like, no, no. That's okay.

463
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:09,918
Okay, well, this is going to
be a very successful event.

464
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:12,778
Like, really great.

465
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:14,881
Okay.

1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,436
- What is that?
- What's what?

2
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:13,086
- S-something spilled.
- What?

3
00:00:13,174 --> 00:00:15,889
- Something spilled in the bed.
- Okay, well, clean it up!

4
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:17,613
No, it's wet.
There's wet in the bed.

5
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:18,957
- What?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:20,944
- Well, what did you spill, David?
- I didn't spill anything!

7
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:22,024
Well, what...

8
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:24,253
are you bleeding?
What?! No!

9
00:00:25,246 --> 00:00:26,663
Well, what is it?

10
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:29,229
Nothing.

11
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:31,550
- Is it you? What happened?
- Nothing!

12
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:33,741
Oh my God, David,

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,509
did you wet the bed?

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,098
No. I have to go.

15
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,569
I have to go.
You're not going anywhere.

16
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:43,925
- No, I need to leave.
- David,

17
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:45,797
calm down, okay?
It's fine.

18
00:00:45,884 --> 00:00:48,277
It's not fine!
Nothing about that is fine.

19
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:50,515
Do we have to file for divorce
if we were never married?

20
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:52,636
We are not getting divorced...
Yet.

21
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:54,980
I need to see if I can get the
stain out of my sheets first.

22
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:56,136
Okay, does that window open?

23
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,525
Because I'm about to jump
out of it!

24
00:00:57,612 --> 00:01:00,231
David, just get in the
shower, I will deal with this.

25
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:01,638
Just let-let me do that for you.

26
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:03,562
And I gotta probably get
these sheets in the wash

27
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:05,512
- sooner than later.
- I will take a shower,

28
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,470
but we must never see
each other again.

29
00:01:07,557 --> 00:01:09,211
Okay, that sounds like
a fair deal.

30
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:12,334
David, I'm gonna need
the bedspread too, so...

31
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:13,868
Just...

32
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:15,303
Okay.

33
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:18,927
I love you.

34
00:01:19,015 --> 00:01:20,413
I'm glad one of us does!

35
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,853

38
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,713
Hey. Hmm!

39
00:01:32,856 --> 00:01:35,049
So how was your seventh
shower?

40
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:36,986
Satisfactory,
thank you so much.

41
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:38,545
- Listen David, I...
- Yeah, you know what?

42
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:39,632
Can we just not?

43
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,301
Well, I think
it's important that we do.

44
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:43,620
- Oh my God!
- Look, things happen.

45
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,378
Yes, things happen!

46
00:01:45,465 --> 00:01:47,648
Things happen
all in your sheets,

47
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:49,419
and now you need to remake
your little bed,

48
00:01:49,507 --> 00:01:50,707
because I peed in it!

49
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,515
David, there is absolutely
nothing to be ashamed of, okay?

50
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:56,252
And look, I found this blanket
that I thought I had lost

51
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,452
in the laundry room,

52
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,957
so you've actually done me
a favour.

53
00:01:59,044 --> 00:02:00,288
Mm.

54
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,411
So maybe we can um...

55
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,394
maybe we can take divorce
off the table?

56
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:09,833
Maybe, but if the tables
were turned,

57
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:12,622
I can't say I'd be as generous.
Understood.

58
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:20,091
- What is that noise?
- I don't know.

59
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,337
Maybe the sheets
are a bit stiff.

60
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:24,767
No, it's like a,
a crinkling sound.

61
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,294
Oh, you're probably just
sitting on the mattress tag.

62
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:32,437
Is this a mattress protector?
No.

63
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:33,802
No, no, that's a...

64
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,238
a second sheet that you put on
the mattress,

65
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:38,488
um, that my mom gave me
when I moved in, so I just...

66
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:41,054
You put down a plastic sheet?

67
00:02:41,142 --> 00:02:42,120
Well, I don't think
it's a pla... I mean,

68
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,669
it might have like a rubberized
coating,

69
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:44,677
- but I don't know.
- Oh my God!

70
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,383
Purely coincidental.

71
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:50,318
Purely coincidental?

72
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,053
Okay, look.

73
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:56,405
I just wanted you to be
comfortable in case

74
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:58,724
- it happened again, that's...
- Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm, mhmm.

75
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:01,703
Come on, David,
it's an expensive mattress!

76
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:05,572
More expensive than my
dignity?

77
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,242
- I mean, comparable, at least.
- Wow.

78
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,941
- Wow!
- Okay.

79
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:12,117
- Well...
- No good?

80
00:03:18,356 --> 00:03:20,190
Hey,
I just got off the phone

81
00:03:20,278 --> 00:03:21,851
with the PR people
from Interflix,

82
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:24,126
they're making the announcement
about the "Crows" movie at noon,

83
00:03:24,213 --> 00:03:26,435
so they've requested that
you do a social media takeover,

84
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:28,223
but don't worry,
I will handle it.

85
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:30,264
Takeover?
That sounds hostile.

86
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:31,788
No, they just want you like,
send out posts

87
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,824
from their account,
but I will do it for you.

88
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:35,792
- You will?
- Mhmm, trust me.

89
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,131
I've dated enough mid-level
latte art influencers

90
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,393
to know
what the people want.

91
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:41,060
I'm sorry Alexis,
I only understood

92
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:42,889
about half of what
you just said.

93
00:03:42,977 --> 00:03:44,800
What exactly is required of me?

94
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:47,100
Um, just like,
a couple of cute pics,

95
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:48,786
and funny one-liners.

96
00:03:49,102 --> 00:03:51,941
I see, and you would be
the architect behind

97
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:53,785
- those funny one-liners?
- Mhmm.

98
00:03:53,873 --> 00:03:56,203
Colour me curious,
what might one

99
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,827
of my humorous quips
sound like to you?

100
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:00,178
Oh my God,
I don't know yet.

101
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:02,258
Well, it's just that you
and I have very different

102
00:04:02,346 --> 00:04:03,825
comedic stylings, dear.

103
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,057
I take a slightly
more cerebral approach.

104
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,455
Okay, you were the one
that described social media

105
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:11,245
as an amusement park for
clinical narcissists so,

106
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,395
- I'm doing you a favour.
- Very well.

107
00:04:13,482 --> 00:04:15,116
Let me see what
you're typing!

108
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,642
"Big news coming soon,
caw caw!"

109
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,629
And a little yellow cartoon...
winking.

110
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:24,138
You know what would be fun,
Alexis,

111
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:26,379
let's put a beak on
that winking cartoon.

112
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,906
No, you can't do that.

113
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:29,844
Let me handle this,
please.

114
00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:31,688
Okay, is it on?
Can they see us?

115
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:34,016
No, you just press "send."

116
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,907
Alexis, this is exciting!

117
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,196
We have our very own
digital soapbox here!

118
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:42,424
It reminds me of the
Nickelodeon pilot I did

119
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:44,829
in which Ashley Tisdale
and I played suffragettes.

120
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,281
- Hm. Mhmm.
- You remember, "You Go, Girl."

121
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:50,245
- Have you pressed send yet?
- Send.

122
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,398
Okay, great. Now we just
wait three and a half hours,

123
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:54,868
until people are on their lunch
break,

124
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:56,965
- and then we post again.
- Okay.

125
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:59,180
Alexis, they're liking it!

126
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:01,052
We have five likes!

127
00:05:01,161 --> 00:05:02,893
People are cawing back!

128
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:05,578
Oh Alexis, I think you and I
might need to purchase...

129
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,516
antibiotics.

130
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:09,503
I believe
we've just gone viral.

131
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,533
Ohhh!

132
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:12,794
'Kay.

133
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:19,913
A 20 minute drive
to another motel.

134
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,606
Mr. Rose,
what are we doing here?

135
00:05:23,694 --> 00:05:26,818
Well, I brought you here,
Stevie, because...

136
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,900
- I think we should buy it.
- Uh.

137
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,445
Yeah, okay.
I'm-I'm not sure about that.

138
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:36,081
No surprise there, Johnny,

139
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,519
I told you she's not the
visionary you and I are.

140
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,848
Stevie, this is the
inevitable next step

141
00:05:40,936 --> 00:05:42,929
in building the Rosebud Empire.

142
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:45,614
Okay, but I think maybe
we should talk about it first,

143
00:05:45,702 --> 00:05:47,783
before we just jump
into building the empire.

144
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:50,428
Well, I know this must be a
little overwhelming right now,

145
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,400
but I thought it was better
for you to...

146
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:53,880
see the place yourself.

147
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:56,056
Roland, there are a lot
of cars here today.

148
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:57,979
I thought you set up
a private showing.

149
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,266
I'm pretty sure I said
private.

150
00:06:00,354 --> 00:06:02,903
Okay, heads up,
this must be the agent.

151
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:04,191
Smile.

152
00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:06,614
Good morning, are you here
for Benny Terkstra?

153
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:09,273
Uh, I spoke with somebody
named Betty,

154
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:11,058
but I was mowing the lawn
at the time,

155
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:13,149
so your guess is as good
as mine.

156
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:15,900
Betty is Benny's wife.
Please, follow me.

157
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:18,179
Huh, Betty and Benny?

158
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,206
What are they, puppets?

159
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:21,866
It's the Benny and Betty Show!

160
00:06:21,954 --> 00:06:22,972
- Okay, Roland...
- Tu! Tu!

161
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:25,631
I'm Betty. I'm Benny.
I'm Betty!

162
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:36,413
Why do I get the feeling
this isn't an open house?

163
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:38,287
Maybe it's because
of the coffin.

164
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,210
This is a funeral, Roland!

165
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:42,713
What exactly did the woman
say to you?!

166
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:45,588
She said the showing
was at nine o'clock.

167
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,258
She may have said viewing.

168
00:06:48,594 --> 00:06:49,991
What the hell, Roland?!

169
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,032
Johnny, language, please!

170
00:06:52,556 --> 00:06:54,121
A man is dead.

171
00:07:01,957 --> 00:07:04,132
David, you know, your tea
has been just sitting here

172
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,090
untouched for about
half an hour,

173
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:07,739
and you're probably gonna
have to drink something

174
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:09,869
at some point.
I'm just not that thirsty.

175
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:11,051
I'm doing inventory.

176
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:12,698
Okay, you're making
this so much more

177
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:14,819
- a thing than it needs to be.
- Am I?

178
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,492
Buongiorno, boys!

179
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,707
Oh ho! Say hello at all my new
hashtag "frands."

180
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:25,193
It's a little word I assembled
to consecrate my fans,

181
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:26,751
who are also my friends.

182
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:29,174
Okay, "frands"
doesn't sound nice.

183
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:32,559
To all of you asking
what is little mercantile

184
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:36,635
establishment with the almost
gallery-like austerity?

185
00:07:36,802 --> 00:07:40,765
Well, it so happens
it's also owned by my son,

186
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:42,474
- David Rose, say hi, David.
- Okay,

187
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,920
I would rather not,
thanks.

188
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:46,191
And his hashtag fiancee,
Patrick.

189
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,653
I don't think you have
to say hashtag

190
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,480
when you're just talking,
Mrs. Rose.

191
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:50,777
Okay, what are you doing?

192
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:52,627
You look like the downfall
of society.

193
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:53,876
Can you please turn that off

194
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:55,235
while you're in our store,
please?

195
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:56,540
Very well.

196
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,976
Frands, please keep checking
your phones

197
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:03,702
for more "Crow" related
intel by me, Moira Rose,

198
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,467
especially you,
"Wine and Cat Gal 74,"

199
00:08:06,555 --> 00:08:08,754
I do hope you stop crying soon.

200
00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:11,024
Caw! Caw! For now.
Muah!

201
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:14,245
Didn't realize you were
on social media.

202
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,479
Only fleetingly.

203
00:08:15,604 --> 00:08:18,458
And only because the network
requested it.

204
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:20,558
That's nice.

205
00:08:23,188 --> 00:08:26,425
Hm, it's noticeably
cheerless in here today.

206
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:27,736
If I didn't know better,

207
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:31,478
I would suspect a little
trouble in paradise.

208
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:34,560
David's just having a bit
of a day.

209
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,088
Didn't get a lot of sleep
last night.

210
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:38,803
Okay, I'm doing fine,
thanks!

211
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,934
David, what's wrong?

212
00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:43,872
Your sleep apnea
hasn't returned, has it?

213
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:47,052
I thought that was remedied
when you got your new nose.

214
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,148
It was.

215
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:49,758
Is it night sweats?

216
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:52,168
You're not eating pepperettes
in bed again!

217
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:53,719
- No.
- Night terrors?

218
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:55,218
I don't wanna talk about it!

219
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:59,674
David, don't tell me you've
had a nighttime oopsie-daisy.

220
00:08:59,969 --> 00:09:01,231
I'm sorry, a what?

221
00:09:01,963 --> 00:09:03,155
I'm leaving.

222
00:09:03,431 --> 00:09:06,524
Okay? And if I don't come back
it's because of you.

223
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:07,963
Me?

224
00:09:09,204 --> 00:09:10,553
Ooh dear.

225
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:13,042
David's nocturnal enuresis
used to only happen

226
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:15,436
when he went to bed
all juiced up

227
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:17,699
with excited anticipation
about something.

228
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:21,016
Christmas, birthdays,
the Ides of March.

229
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,581
And now it seems
your impending nuptials

230
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:25,234
has opened the floodgates.

231
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:26,466
Oh!

232
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:28,142
Why am I oddly flattered?

233
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:29,850
I can't imagine.

234
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:31,855
Hmm.

235
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:33,841
Well, I hate to point
this out, Mr. Rose,

236
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:36,261
but if you weren't in such
a rush to see this place,

237
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:37,676
we wouldn't be at a funeral.

238
00:09:37,763 --> 00:09:39,221
No, it's what happens

239
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:40,788
when you leave anything
up to Roland.

240
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,144
We just have to find a window
where we can leave

241
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:44,770
without anybody seeing us.

242
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:47,077
Because the last thing we want
to do is offend the woman

243
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:48,469
that's selling us this place.

244
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:51,670
Well, assuming
we're actually buying it.

245
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:53,451
You know what they say,

246
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:55,517
you can tell the quality
of a motel

247
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:57,793
by the food they serve
at the owner's funeral.

248
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:59,784
We're not even supposed
to be here, Roland,

249
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:01,698
can you put the plate...
Is that egg salad?

250
00:10:01,786 --> 00:10:03,245
Johnny, is it?

251
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:06,091
- Yes, yes, it is.
- Mrs. Terkstra,

252
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,007
this is Johnny Rose.

253
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:10,340
I-I'm sorry,
I don't believe we've met.

254
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:12,256
Um, how did you know my Benny?

255
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:13,764
Johnny...

256
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:18,325
Yes well, we were uh,
friends, I mean...

257
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:20,566
acquaintances,
I would say...

258
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:23,774
- From the bowling league.
- Uh, you mean curling?

259
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:26,309
Did-Did you curl with my Benny?

260
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:28,749
I-you know, more important,

261
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,480
I think we just wanted
to come by

262
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:31,947
- and pay our respects.
- Mm-hmm.

263
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:33,899
Because this must be
so difficult for you

264
00:10:33,987 --> 00:10:35,946
dealing with your loss,

265
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,576
and uh... selling the motel.

266
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:42,144
I'm sorry, I'm still trying
to place you.

267
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:46,172
I-I don't remember seeing you
at Benny's last bonspiel.

268
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,843
Well, that's because
Johnny here um...

269
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:53,453
had another bonspiel to go to,

270
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,953
and unfortunately that bonspiel

271
00:10:56,183 --> 00:10:58,403
was way more important
than Benny's bonspiel, so we...

272
00:10:58,499 --> 00:10:59,743
Well, Ro-Roland that...

273
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:01,213
- we had to go to that bonspiel.
- No, no, no,

274
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,780
- that was I would've been...
- I think I know why you're here.

275
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,312
It might be more appropriate

276
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,347
to have this conversation
outside.

277
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:13,804
Since I wasn't in the curling
league, can I go home?

278
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,794
No. No.

279
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:26,127
Say Havarti, girls!

280
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:29,204
Oh no!

281
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:31,370
Well, you can't win them all.

282
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,569
Wow, someone's
in a surprisingly good mood,

283
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:35,572
considering they're
15 minutes late.

284
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,426
- Blame my new internet frands.
- What'd she just say?

285
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:41,120
Oh, I was dragooned into
taking over the Interflix

286
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,628
social media channels today,

287
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:44,650
and apparently I'm quite
proficient at it.

288
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,653
I thought you hated
social media.

289
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,392
What did you call it, a um,

290
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,743
a cauldron of self-absorption.

291
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:53,621
You have an almost unsetting
memory, Twyla.

292
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:56,201
Now just a quick snap
for my friend,

293
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:59,161
"Wine and Cat Gal 74,"
and her frands

294
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:00,901
at the rehabilitation facility.

295
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:02,904
Fine, but nothing gets posted

296
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:05,212
without my written approval.

297
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:07,720
Oh Alexis, wonderful!
I was just about to post.

298
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:10,015
Will you please do a selfie
of me, and my Jazzigals?

299
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:11,691
Um, actually, may I speak
with you for a moment?

300
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:14,638
If Interflix is asking
if I'll extend my takeover,

301
00:12:14,726 --> 00:12:16,879
my answer is,
I'll think about it.

302
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,166
Mm, actually,

303
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:20,445
I think we might wanna discuss
this matter privately.

304
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:23,115
Okay, two minutes, gals?
In the meantime,

305
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:24,833
if you'd like to follow
the Interflix channels...

306
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,762
Oh no, that won't be
necessary.

307
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:29,510
Okay, who taught you how
to livestream?!

308
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:31,426
A wonderful teen named
CherryBus,

309
00:12:31,514 --> 00:12:33,416
she lives in Singapore.
Why? Who wants to know?

310
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:35,223
Okay, well, did she teach you
how to turn it off?

311
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,518
Because you just posted
your entire conversation

312
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:38,577
with David and Patrick!

313
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:41,277
No, I distinctly remember
putting down the phone.

314
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:42,946
But you didn't stop
recording.

315
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:45,106
So people basically got like,
a whole podcast

316
00:12:45,194 --> 00:12:47,029
about how David's wetting
the bed again.

317
00:12:47,236 --> 00:12:48,841
If I wasn't your publicist,
I would be enjoying

318
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:50,724
the situation a lot more
than I am.

319
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,814
Which is still like,
quite a lot.

320
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:54,648
Oh, dear.

321
00:12:55,351 --> 00:12:58,006
Fortunately, David doesn't
subscribe to social media,

322
00:12:58,093 --> 00:12:59,764
so we-we just need
to take it down,

323
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:01,665
and David will be none
the wiser.

324
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:03,696
- Okay.
- Hey Moira,

325
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,302
you weren't lying!

326
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,379
You do have
a knack for this.

327
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:08,585
What are we looking at?

328
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,583
Okay, um, no need
to watch that.

329
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:12,304
Okay, Twyla, if you haven't
seen it already,

330
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,439
then maybe just once,
but that is it!

331
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:19,708
Now, I-I'd like to start
from the beginning.

332
00:13:19,796 --> 00:13:21,432
Mrs. Terkstra,
we-we were just...

333
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,449
- I was speaking.
- Yes, you were.

334
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:25,338
It's becoming very clear
that you people

335
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:26,969
didn't know
my husband at all.

336
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,454
Well now,
when you say "know" uh...

337
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:31,061
- Am I still talking?!
- Yes, you were, ma'am.

338
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,760
I can't say I wasn't
expecting you,

339
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:34,893
I just didn't think you'd
show up at the funeral!

340
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:37,954
I'm aware that my husband
was not perfect.

341
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:40,817
I told him that poker ring
was risky,

342
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:43,386
and I know there were some
shady business dealings

343
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:44,853
that went on behind
closed doors,

344
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:46,530
but I had nothing
to do with it!

345
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:47,760
I'm sorry?

346
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:49,882
Well, you're the federal
agents I was warned about.

347
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,527
No need to keep up
the act.

348
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:53,991
Her face has "fed" written
all over it.

349
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,197
Thanks...

350
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:57,230
Mrs. Terkstra,
we're not feds.

351
00:13:57,318 --> 00:13:59,972
No, there seems to have been
some crossed wires here.

352
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,682
No, we thought we were coming
out to look at the property.

353
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:05,072
We're from
Rosebud Motel.

354
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,932
Maureen Bud's old place?

355
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,298
That would be the one.

356
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:11,213
Uh, Aunt Maureen is...
was my aunt.

357
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:13,472
Oh, for heaven's sakes!

358
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,371
Benny and I used to play bingo
with Maureen.

359
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:19,007
What a small world!

360
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:21,494
Johnny and I used to play
bingo with Maureen,

361
00:14:21,582 --> 00:14:23,265
right after curling.
Roland.

362
00:14:23,352 --> 00:14:25,785
Well, it would be a relief
to sell this place

363
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:27,139
to someone
we know.

364
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:29,039
Uh, well,
we're not sure yet.

365
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:31,859
But we can touch base
again next week,

366
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:35,277
and again, you have our
deepest condolences.

367
00:14:35,538 --> 00:14:37,383
Well, now that you're here,
why don't you come on in,

368
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,288
- and pay your respects to Benny?
- Oh...

369
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:41,596
Considering you may be taking
over his home.

370
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:43,173
Yes, yes, yes.
Well, sure.

371
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:45,939
We can come in,
and pay our respects.

372
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:47,854
Too bad it's not
an open casket.

373
00:14:47,957 --> 00:14:50,769
I would've loved to say goodbye
to old Benny's face.

374
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,357
We'd be happy to open it
for you.

375
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:54,688
No, no, closed-closed
is fine.

376
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:56,965
You sure?

377
00:15:03,138 --> 00:15:06,325
Oh look Alexis,
Patrick's here.

378
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:09,440
Yep, you asked me
to meet you here.

379
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,573
Hmm.

380
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:13,165
So what-what-what's goin' on?

381
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,028
And David is bewitching
himself elsewhere?

382
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,513
Yeah, he is uh,
dusting the shelves,

383
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:21,293
even though I cleaned them
last week,

384
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:23,915
but hey, whatever it takes
to get him through this.

385
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:27,053
Priority number one,
get David through this!

386
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:28,809
Mhmm, mhmm!

387
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:31,074
Quick "Q," um,

388
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:33,480
has David taken your phone,
or anything,

389
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:35,990
or like, looked
at anyone else's phone?

390
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,613
No.

391
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,234
Sorry, somebody wanna tell me
what's goin' on?

392
00:15:41,322 --> 00:15:43,746
Okay, okay...
so, no biggie,

393
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:47,138
but my mom may have
accidentally posted

394
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:49,958
your little conversation
from this morning

395
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:51,746
over social media.

396
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:54,921
The-the one about...

397
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:56,489
The oopsie-daisy.
Yes.

398
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:58,537
But don't worry,
I am involved now,

399
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,068
and I will be taking it down.

400
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:01,300
It's still up?!

401
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:03,572
And generating a lot
of traction.

402
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:06,453
But yes, it's been uh,
we're taking it...

403
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,582
it's being taken down
right now.

404
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,895
So how...
how did this happen?

405
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:13,941
Right. I was strong-armed

406
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:16,767
into participating
in social marketing,

407
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:19,913
and a dear friend of mine
from Singapore,

408
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:21,169
Miss CherryBus,

409
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:24,640
suggested I try my hand at
creating a living stream.

410
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:26,344
Okay, she doesn't know
what she's doing,

411
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:27,896
and didn't know that
it was recording.

412
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:31,274
Okay look,
David can never,

413
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,215
ever find out about this.

414
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:35,905
I am actually afraid that
he will never sleep again.

415
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:38,981
Precisely why we're involving
you in this covert stratagem.

416
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:41,377
So all we need to do is keep
David off the internet

417
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:42,605
for like, 24 hours,

418
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:44,370
or until a celebrity says
something wrong,

419
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,155
which could be any minute.

420
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:48,054
Okay, I think I can
handle that.

421
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:51,058
Wonderful!
Crisis averted. Hmm!

422
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:53,916
Yeah, so you still haven't
taken the post down.

423
00:16:56,204 --> 00:16:58,250
- I'm doing that now.
- Cool.

424
00:16:58,338 --> 00:16:59,938
So I'll just sit here
until that happens.

425
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,220
- It's kind of cute, though.
- Alexis.

426
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:04,644
Yes.

427
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:06,398
- Let's take it down.
- Mhmm.

428
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,607
Oh Stevie,

429
00:17:19,766 --> 00:17:22,066
listen, I owe you
an apology for today.

430
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:24,246
You know, the way I rushed you
into that thing.

431
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:27,301
On the plus side, we did make
that personal connection,

432
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:29,334
and I think we might be able
to get a better deal

433
00:17:29,422 --> 00:17:32,193
- than I had thought.
- Okay... "we?"

434
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,191
Unless you have
a better idea,

435
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:36,755
I know you wanted to talk
this out, so uh...

436
00:17:36,843 --> 00:17:38,069
I'm all ears.

437
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:40,585
Mr. Rose, what I've been
trying to talk to you about

438
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:43,534
is more than just
the new motel.

439
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:45,901
Oh. Well...

440
00:17:46,322 --> 00:17:48,029
what is it, Stevie?

441
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:52,837
I don't think I'm ready, to...

442
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:57,363
commit to this business like,

443
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,308
as a whole.

444
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:02,006
Oh.

445
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,001
Well, that is a bigger
conversation, isn't it?

446
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:08,052
It's just, doing
"Cabaret" made me feel

447
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,806
like I should push myself,

448
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:12,365
and so I just wondered...

449
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,122
you know, maybe there's
something more

450
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,864
out there for me.

451
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,836
Well, what are you saying,
you want out?

452
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:24,339
No! Uh, I don't know,
I just...

453
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:28,255
I feel like
I'd regret it

454
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:31,456
if I didn't at least try
to see what's out there.

455
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,563
Well, if that's what you feel

456
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:36,280
you need to push yourself,
Stevie, I uh...

457
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:39,870
certainly am not gonna stand
in your way.

458
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,665
Same reason I left the button
factory

459
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,431
when I was a young man.

460
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:46,195
That, and the fact that
working conditions

461
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:48,643
weren't exactly safe
for a ten-year-old, but...

462
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:51,344
that being said,
I'm not going to pretend

463
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:53,822
that I don't hope
you'll come back.

464
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:57,720
Either way, I hope you find
what you're looking for.

465
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:02,149
Mr. Rose...
thank you.

466
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:05,767
Okay, you know what?
I think...

467
00:19:06,534 --> 00:19:08,471
I should just head home early,

468
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:11,673
- and think about it.
- Yeah...

469
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,616
or you can think about it
as you finish your shift?

470
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,967
That's fair.

471
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,989
I'm gonna miss
that enthusiasm.

472
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:34,946
I'm so glad you decided
to stay.

473
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,147
Well, there's literally
no liquid left in my body, so.

474
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:41,637
- Oh!
- Yeah...

475
00:19:41,771 --> 00:19:42,898
Forgot about this.

476
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:44,483
Taking that off first
thing tomorrow.

477
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:45,927
Huh!

478
00:19:49,142 --> 00:19:51,860
I wonder how long my mom
lasted on the internets.

479
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,068
Not long, I don't think.

480
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:56,007
You know, you were smart
to get off of there.

481
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,358
Mhmm. I was curious to see
what kinds of things

482
00:19:58,495 --> 00:20:00,715
she was posting throughout
the day, though.

483
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:02,750
- Yeah, nothing of note.
- Hmm.

484
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:04,926
Um yeah, she really didn't
know how to use it, so.

485
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:06,081
- Mhmm.
- Hey,

486
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:07,562
let's talk about something
else.

487
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:09,605
Sure, um...

488
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:12,833
what's the thread count
on this plastic?

489
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:17,015
Okay, would it help
if I were to share

490
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:20,088
something private and
embarrassing with you?

491
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:22,496
I might be too tired
for that tonight.

492
00:20:22,593 --> 00:20:23,942
Ha ha!

493
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,334
If we're gonna be married,
I just think it's important

494
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:30,293
that we be as open and honest
with each other

495
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:32,166
as we possibly can.

496
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,278
What is this sexy thing?

497
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:38,814
Okay, I only put this in
when you're not around.

498
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,619
It's my mouthguard.
Oh...

499
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,471
well, there's nothing really
embarrassing about that.

500
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,968
Also, you look very beautiful.

501
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:48,665
Aw, thank you.

502
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:51,015
Um, hmm.

503
00:20:51,189 --> 00:20:52,669
How about...

504
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:55,847
- now?
- My God!

505
00:20:55,936 --> 00:20:57,546
This is my nose thing,

506
00:20:57,634 --> 00:20:59,749
and it just helps me breathe
better.

507
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:04,295
I have never been more
attracted to you.

508
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,689
Mm, same.

509
00:21:08,742 --> 00:21:10,069
Ooh!

510
00:21:14,924 --> 00:21:17,107
Ronnie's texting me
a link to something?

511
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:20,113
Okay, put it away, David.
It's bedtime.

512
00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:25,144

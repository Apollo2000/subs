1
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:12,141
Kids, it happens to be
our anniversary today,

2
00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:14,477
so it might be a nice idea
if you wished your mother

3
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:15,945
a happy anniversary.

4
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:17,847
Okay, um...

5
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:19,718
What would you like us to say?

6
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:22,084
Well, you could start by saying,

7
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:23,554
"Happy anniversary."

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,255
Mmm, okay, but why are we wishing her

9
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:27,690
a happy anniversary?

10
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:29,288
Isn't that something that you two

11
00:00:29,323 --> 00:00:30,406
are supposed to say to each other?

12
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,532
Yeah, it's called
being courteous, honey.

13
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:34,894
You know, the Bloomfield kids
used to throw their parents

14
00:00:34,928 --> 00:00:36,729
an anniversary party every year.

15
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:38,965
Mhmm... um, if we're truth telling,

16
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:41,300
the Bloomfields were
always a little too friendly

17
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:42,769
with one another.

18
00:00:42,803 --> 00:00:44,303
I just don't understand
what kind of family

19
00:00:44,338 --> 00:00:46,328
skinny dips together.

20
00:00:46,607 --> 00:00:48,007
John, are you ready?

21
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:49,132
Yes, sweetheart.

22
00:00:49,157 --> 00:00:51,377
Happy anniversary!

23
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:54,447
Congratulations on your
ongoing love for one another.

24
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:55,796
You did it!

25
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,550
Okay kids, that's enough.

26
00:00:57,584 --> 00:00:59,750
You sound like the
incestuous Bloomfields.

27
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:01,555
Have a blessed day.

28

29
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:12,965
Ahem! Hello there, Roses.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,467
- Hello there, you!
- Yes...

31
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:15,935
May we join you?

32
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:18,504
- Oh, we just ordered to go.
- Yeah, we're not staying,

33
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:20,039
we've got a million things to do.

34
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:22,108
Oh, well then, I guess you don't want

35
00:01:22,142 --> 00:01:24,043
your present then, huh?

36
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,714
You wanna guess what your present is?

37
00:01:27,748 --> 00:01:29,782
- No, I do not.
- Dinner!

38
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:32,117
We're gifting you a dinner!

39
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:35,421
At the most exclusive eatery in Elmdale.

40
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:37,390
- Oh.
- It's very hard to get a table.

41
00:01:37,424 --> 00:01:39,659
But uh, I pulled a few strings.

42
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:42,595
That sounds too good
to... what's the catch?

43
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:44,163
No, there's-there's no catch,

44
00:01:44,198 --> 00:01:47,062
just every new council
member gets a dinner, so.

45
00:01:47,468 --> 00:01:50,002
Oh, how very civilized.

46
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:53,439
It is... thank you, Roland. We accept.

47
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:55,775
Terrific, so we'll pick
you up around seven.

48
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:57,944
- We?
- Yeah, we have a coupon.

49
00:01:57,978 --> 00:02:00,079
Four entrees for the price of three,

50
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:01,820
it expires soon, though.

51
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:04,417
It should be really fun, you guys.

52
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:06,886
Yes, it will be fun...

53
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,254
Well, it would be fun,

54
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:10,823
if today were not our anniversary.

55
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,659
- Yeah...
- Wow, happy anniversary!

56
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:15,461
Well, thank you, thank you.

57
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:17,896
You two are obviously
gonna want to spend tonight

58
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:19,078
just the two of you, so...

59
00:02:19,103 --> 00:02:21,234
- Yes, that was the plan.
- Yeah.

60
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:23,035
Oh, well you know, the coupon expires

61
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,604
in three weeks, so...

62
00:02:24,638 --> 00:02:26,205
Okay, all right, let it go.

63
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,640
You have fun, you guys!

64
00:02:27,674 --> 00:02:29,041
- Okay.
- Okay?

65
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:31,257
- Bye bye, now.
- Bye!

66
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:33,846
Boy, that was a close call.

67
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,257
What are you doing with that?

68
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:44,446
With what, this yearbook?

69
00:02:44,558 --> 00:02:46,085
Could you put it back, please?!

70
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:49,109
Why would I put it back,

71
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:51,302
when Stevie Budd was voted:

72
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:53,382
"Most likely to get the guy."

73
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:56,210
With that hair cut?!

74
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:58,870
I'll have you know I was
very popular with the boys.

75
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:01,060
And girls, it seems.

76
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:03,509
Wow, well, according to the Internet,

77
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:06,679
you were "Mister Popular."

78
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:08,314
I will have you know that that head-shot

79
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:11,109
got me a two-episode
arc on a TV series.

80
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:12,482
What series?

81
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:14,445
"Dateline."

82
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:18,305
I played a boy who got
abducted from a grocery store.

83
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,026
- Wow.
- Yeah.

84
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,828
And the performance was so riveting,

85
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:24,710
people thought I actually
was the "Value-mart victim."

86
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:27,130
Hmm, bet that got you laid.

87
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:29,890
It did. It really did.

88
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:34,841
You know, I am surprised
that you haven't asked me

89
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,421
to leave early today.

90
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:38,281
Are you telepathic or something,

91
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:40,842
because I have been thinking
about asking you that question

92
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:42,226
every day this week.

93
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:44,007
I was just kidding.

94
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:47,189
Oh... no yeah, me too.

95
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:50,583
No, just with the big
soiree at Mutt's tonight,

96
00:03:50,657 --> 00:03:53,406
I figured that you would
need ample time to get ready.

97
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:56,273
Mutt's having a soiree?

98
00:03:56,298 --> 00:03:57,597
Well, I'm sure you're invited.

99
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:01,329
Yeah, no. Yeah, no, why wouldn't I be?

100
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:03,530
Um, were you invited?

101
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:05,004
Yeah. Yeah.

102
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:08,174
I guess it's just-just
a bit of a pride issue,

103
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,110
you know, do I attend the
party hosted by the guy

104
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:13,053
that... you left me for?

105
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:15,214
Yeah, no, I'm sure he wouldn't mind.

106
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:18,764
Yeah, but I really would
have to basically throw

107
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:21,354
all my self-respect just
right out the window.

108
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:23,222
Aww, that's so sweet.

109
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:25,945
So um, what time is the party tonight?

110
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:29,829
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.

111
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:32,531
Oh darling, what a sweet gesture,

112
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:33,933
and a precursor no doubt,

113
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:36,109
to something more grand planned.

114
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:39,039
Something more grand?

115
00:04:39,373 --> 00:04:41,816
Ah, knowing your penchant for surprises,

116
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:44,686
I'm guessing you have
something else up your sleeve.

117
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,937
- Yes, I do.
- Uh oh!

118
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:51,297
I do, I...

119
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:53,031
Was going to tell you later,

120
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:56,055
but I booked a restaurant in Elmdale,

121
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:58,424
it's supposed to be very fancy!

122
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,527
The one that Roland and
Jocelyn just told us about?

123
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:03,629
Yes! Yes, but...

124
00:05:03,664 --> 00:05:05,798
Who knew they were asking us tonight!

125
00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:07,867
- Just the two of us?
- Mhmm.

126
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:10,503
Sort of a "Lady and the Tramp"
meets "9 1/2 Weeks"

127
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:12,257
kind of dinner date?

128
00:05:12,506 --> 00:05:14,774
Could for one second
believe that I would not

129
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:18,164
have planned something...
For our anniversary?

130
00:05:18,587 --> 00:05:19,648
Tonight?

131
00:05:20,814 --> 00:05:21,796
The two of us?

132
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:34,212
Hi, Rose, party of two.

133
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:36,329
Yeah, we spoke on the
phone this afternoon.

134
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:38,164
You're lucky we had that cancellation.

135
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:39,865
Yes, well, lucky for someone.

136
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,336
We... had a reservation
which I of course made uh,

137
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:44,976
weeks ago.

138
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:46,706
You always could swing a good table

139
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,140
at the last minute, John.

140
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:51,004
Okay, it'll just be a few minutes.

141
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:52,896
- Thank you.
- Okay.

142
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,226
Moira?

143
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,973
- Bev?
- Don!

144
00:05:55,998 --> 00:05:57,365
- Moira!
- Bev!

145
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,091
Oh my God, the Roses! You're alive!

146
00:05:59,116 --> 00:06:00,684
- Ohhhh!
- Oh my gosh!

147
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:03,244
- Good to see you!
- Wow! What? Don?

148
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:06,256
- Oh, I don't believe it!
- Come on, Don!

149
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:07,626
Muah! Muah!

150
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:09,128
What are you two doing here?

151
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:10,830
Well, we were dropping
MacKenzie off at college,

152
00:06:10,864 --> 00:06:12,631
and decided we'd take
the scenic route home.

153
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,134
You must... they should...
you must join us!

154
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:16,635
Join us for dinner!

155
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,070
- Well-oh, yes!
- That would be great!

156
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:21,574
We are just dying to find
out what you've been up to!

157
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:23,476
We're dying to tell you!

158
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,910
Okay.

159
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:26,992
Ohhh...

160
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:41,694
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

161
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:43,129
Oh, I wouldn't either,

162
00:06:43,163 --> 00:06:44,530
but I couldn't find a cocktail shaker,

163
00:06:44,564 --> 00:06:46,953
and someone brought
room temperature vodka.

164
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:50,669
N-no, I mean... Mutt made those
ice cubes from well water,

165
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:53,072
so... they smell a little fishy.

166
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:54,265
Oh.

167
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:56,509
Yeah, wouldn't want
that melting in my drink,

168
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:57,877
thank you very much.

169
00:06:57,911 --> 00:07:00,446
- I'm Jake.
- David.

170
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,156
It's nice to meet you, handsome.

171
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:10,849
I-I'll-I'm gonna...
So I'll just...

172
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,596
Wow! Look at you.

173
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:19,365
What's that supposed to mean?

174
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,406
No, I've just never seen
you this dressed up before.

175
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:23,616
I do what I want.

176
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:27,039
And tonight, I'm
wanting to meet someone.

177
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:28,140
Hmm.

178
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:29,818
So, I have a certain
high school reputation

179
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:31,310
I need to live up to.

180
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:32,978
Uh huh, yeah, and good luck with that.

181
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:35,181
Um, speaking of sexual popularity,

182
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm pretty sure that
um... that guy at the bar,

183
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:42,460
is into me.

184
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:45,812
- Who, Jake?
- Yeah. Jake.

185
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:50,470
Why, was he one of your
high school conquests?

186
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:51,758
Actually, no.

187
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:54,266
But I have a pretty stellar
radar for being able to tell

188
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:55,701
when guys are into me.

189
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:59,406
Mhmm... um, and having
swam in both ponds,

190
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,708
I can say that I might be
able to navigate those waters

191
00:08:02,742 --> 00:08:04,453
a little but better than you.

192
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:07,713
Uh huh? Well, we'll see.

193
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:09,348
Hmm.

194
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,353
So-so there we are at Izzy
Tennison's country home...

195
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,755
Oh, tell me she doesn't
still have that stuffed bison.

196
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,490
Oh, does she have it?

197
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,750
She's moved it to the front hall!

198
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:31,459
What?!

199
00:08:31,484 --> 00:08:33,905
Grier wanted to hang
her coat on the horns!

200
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:38,200
And it gets better. Don here...

201
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:39,601
Oh, wait now, don't
throw me under the bus,

202
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:41,136
it was Borden who started it all.

203
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:42,971
Borden Simons?

204
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,807
It's like old home week!

205
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:48,453
Anyway, I look over,

206
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:51,547
and Don and Borden are
on their hands and knees,

207
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:54,817
crawling through the
doggie door in the kitchen!

208
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:59,087
It was too funny!

209
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,390
- Oh, you should've been there.
- Oh, wish we could've been.

210
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:04,406
- Maybe next time.
- Well, cheers to that!

211
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:06,209
Cheers.

212
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:11,897
Hey uh... Johnny? Moira?

213
00:09:11,922 --> 00:09:14,140
Oh my God!

214
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:16,085
Um, what are you guys doing here?

215
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:19,434
Well, we-we just ran into each other.

216
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:21,109
It's their anniversary, Roland,

217
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,644
just let them do what they want.

218
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,146
It's your anniversary?
You should've told us!

219
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,328
We don't want to intrude.

220
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:28,317
No, you're not intruding,
this is a surprise treat.

221
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,687
Oh, okay, well then, are we intruding?

222
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:33,388
Because before you were saying

223
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:35,437
that you didn't wanna
go out tonight, so...

224
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:38,026
No, no, we-we uh...

225
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:39,695
You can certainly join us,

226
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:41,421
if you don't have your own table.

227
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,144
We do, but that would be great!

228
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:45,830
- Okay!
- Yes, well then, by all means,

229
00:09:45,855 --> 00:09:49,691
yes, let's uh-let's...
Let's all sit at one table.

230
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:51,717
- This is cozy. Hello.
- Hi.

231
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,709
Good evening.

232
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:12,125
Wow. Look at you.

233
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:14,263
Is it weird that I'm here?

234
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:15,697
It's only weird if you think it's weird.

235
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:18,200
Yeah. Okay. I don't if you don't.

236
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:20,636
Um, in fact, I don't actually
know how late I can stay.

237
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,106
I just wanted to pop in, and say hey.

238
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,523
Well, you're awfully
dolled up for a "pop in."

239
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:30,058
Oh my God, stop, I 
basically came from work.

240
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,218
Babe, your stove's being testy again,

241
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:33,677
should I just serve the cider cold?

242
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:38,640
Uh... Alexis, this is uh, my girlfriend,

243
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:41,790
Tennessee. Wow!

244
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:43,570
Wow. Woweee.

245
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:45,596
Alexis, hi.

246
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:47,129
It's so nice to finally meet you,

247
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:48,830
Mutt's told me so much about you.

248
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:51,171
The way he describes you,
it's like you're this...

249
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:53,568
Beautiful little poem.

250
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:55,804
Well, love "little!"

251
00:10:55,838 --> 00:10:58,740
Look at you! You're like a poem too.

252
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:02,344
Like, a really pretty poem, or like,

253
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,296
a mermaid, or something.

254
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:06,695
Mutt, you're growing back your beard.

255
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:10,018
Yeah, she likes it.

256
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:11,335
Okay.

257
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:16,158
Um, okay uh, I'm gonna go grab a drink.

258
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:19,328
But um, it was so nice
to finally meet you,

259
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:20,640
Tallahassee, so...

260
00:11:20,665 --> 00:11:23,332
- It's ah, Tennessee.
- Yes, Tennessee.

261
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:25,937
I love that name, it's so unique.

262
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,669
Um, thank God you look the way you do,

263
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:29,859
because that name on the
wrong girl would just...

264
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,556
Ooh! So...

265
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:33,226
You should feel really
good about yourself.

266
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:36,875
She's cute.

267
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:40,282
You guys haven't ordered yet, have you?

268
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:43,453
Because I need to present this
coupon to the waiter first.

269
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:46,593
Don't know what that means.

270
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,414
He's so ironic, this one.

271
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:50,500
Oh!

272
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,528
So where are you living now, Moira?

273
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:54,859
Tell us all about it.

274
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:58,601
Oh, we're in a rustic, ranch style...

275
00:11:58,753 --> 00:12:01,507
Bungalow... that...

276
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:03,484
It's very nice.

277
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:06,640
Very nice, it's got plenty of parking,

278
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:08,442
and a TV in every room.

279
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,593
Oh, how many bedrooms?

280
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:12,786
- Ten.
- Ten bedrooms!

281
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:15,979
Yeah, well, we don't
use all the bedrooms.

282
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:18,505
That must be a nightmare to clean!

283
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,632
Um, Stevie does an adequate job.

284
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,391
- Stevie's one of your staff?
- Mhmm!

285
00:12:22,592 --> 00:12:25,101
Stevie's the only staff.

286
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:27,763
This olive tapenade is...

287
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:29,343
Salty, I know!

288
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:31,458
Is it? I-I thought it was good,

289
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,358
but yeah, it's salty.

290
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:36,052
Hmm! Here's a funny story.

291
00:12:36,077 --> 00:12:37,273
Oh, good.

292
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,167
On our way here, we
drove through a town...

293
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:45,589
Not a word of a lie,
called... "Schittstown!"

294
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:48,483
Oh! No, it was called, "Schittsville!"

295
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,318
Schittsville!

296
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,753
And from the looks of it,

297
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:53,722
the town was living up to its name!

298
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:56,458
Let's not go for the
low-hanging fruit here, Don.

299
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:59,539
Okay? No, these are funny jokes.

300
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:01,617
Please continue, Don.

301
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:05,382
You see, Roland gets it!

302
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:17,279
You know, I'm actually
having more fun at this party

303
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:18,679
than I thought I would.

304
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:21,125
How did you do it?

305
00:13:21,387 --> 00:13:23,254
Well, I started by drinking all four

306
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,946
of those peach schnapps
that you left in my fridge...

307
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,795
No, I mean you seemed
so cool about everything

308
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,875
after we broke up. It
was almost annoying.

309
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:32,960
Cool?

310
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:37,359
Alexis... I couldn't stop crying.

311
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:39,671
I was scaring all the animals at work.

312
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:46,781
But when I... had to go on
our honeymoon without you,

313
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,111
the zip line instructor

314
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:51,646
at the Los Passions
Couples Resort told me

315
00:13:51,681 --> 00:13:53,945
that I just gotta get through it.

316
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:59,015
Meaning my fear of heights,
which I did get through.

317
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,210
But with you, it just...

318
00:14:02,824 --> 00:14:04,791
It took a little longer.

319
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:08,328
I'm sorry.

320
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:10,562
It's okay.

321
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:15,937
Staff dance?

322
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:17,972
Yes!

323
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,617
Mmm!

324
00:14:28,642 --> 00:14:31,929
Hmm, I thought I was
shame eating in private.

325
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:34,383
What is shame eating?

326
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,375
I don't think we have
enough time for that tonight.

327
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:40,328
Are you looking for someone?

328
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:42,440
No, yeah, I mean, sorry,

329
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,534
I'm just, I lost my friend
who should... be around here

330
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:47,836
somewhere um, watching this so.

331
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,226
Are you here with Stevie?

332
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,148
I am. Yeah.

333
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,308
- Okay.
- Not here "with."

334
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:55,343
No, we're not together,
I'm very much single, so.

335
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,195
You wanna get some air?

336
00:14:57,837 --> 00:14:59,838
Yeah. Uh huh.

337
00:14:59,863 --> 00:15:01,230
Mm! Yeah.

338
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:08,957
Who do you have to kill around here

339
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,179
to get another bottle
of this undrinkable wine?

340
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,023
I think it's good.

341
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:16,764
I ordered the one with the
highest alcohol content.

342
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:18,578
What do you do, Roland?

343
00:15:19,014 --> 00:15:21,789
Something in agriculture,
by the looks of it?

344
00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:25,777
Roland is actually
the mayor of our town.

345
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:27,273
Oh!

346
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:28,546
Not Schittsville, I hope!

347
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:33,303
What do you even call
someone from Schittsville?

348
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:35,453
A Schitter? A Schitthead?

349
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:38,179
- Okay, you know what?
- John, John.

350
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,127
Don't worry, Moira, I
won't say anything untoward.

351
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,769
We're just having fun, John.

352
00:15:42,794 --> 00:15:44,395
And I thought we were having fun, Bev,

353
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,854
but you know what, we're not.

354
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,113
Oh come on, it's just a joke!

355
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:50,664
No Don, here's the joke.

356
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:54,601
The joke is I'm sitting here
in a half decent restaurant

357
00:15:55,017 --> 00:15:58,484
with my wife... and our friends...

358
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:03,429
And all you two have done
is complain about the food,

359
00:16:03,454 --> 00:16:06,189
and pretend that you
didn't leave us high and dry

360
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:08,181
after we lost everything.

361
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,153
Oh, we're past all that now.

362
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,835
I'm not quite past it, Moira.

363
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:14,835
You wrote us off, Don.

364
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:17,632
Not a phone call,

365
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:20,070
not an email,

366
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:22,093
not a nickel.

367
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:26,393
Roland and Jocelyn here,

368
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,119
could not have been more generous

369
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:31,257
with what little they have.

370
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,039
They found us a place to live,

371
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:37,382
they've offered us their
truck whenever we've needed it.

372
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:40,968
They've invited us to their parties,

373
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:46,017
they even offered to take
us out to dinner tonight.

374
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,056
Well, just to be clear, Johnny,

375
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,491
we were always gonna split the bill,

376
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:50,493
it's just with the coupon...

377
00:16:50,518 --> 00:16:51,852
Rollie, Rollie.

378
00:16:56,738 --> 00:16:58,719
And that town you passed through,

379
00:16:59,244 --> 00:17:01,378
it's not called Schittsville.

380
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:02,907
It's called Schitt's Creek.

381
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:05,798
And it's where we live.

382
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:20,522
So Jake, um...

383
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:22,857
Do you drink red wine, or white wine?

384
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:24,274
I don't really drink wine.

385
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:26,055
I'm more of a beer guy.

386
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,547
Right. Yeah.

387
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:29,907
That doesn't help me much. Um...

388
00:17:29,972 --> 00:17:32,340
Well, I better get going.

389
00:17:32,476 --> 00:17:34,811
I've gotta get to the shop
early tomorrow morning, so.

390
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:36,610
Oh, you work retail as well?

391
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,463
No, no. The wood shop. I make furniture.

392
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:43,071
Ah. Yeah. No, I did a lot of um...

393
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:45,050
I did a lot of wood
working in high school.

394
00:17:45,075 --> 00:17:46,624
- Oh.
- Yeah, uh,

395
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,650
Christie McFadden
accidentally nailed her hand

396
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:50,298
to her paper towel holder,

397
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:53,415
so that's-the lesson is
just not to nail stuff...

398
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:00,204
You know, I'm a pretty open-minded guy.

399
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:03,501
So... why don't you stop
by the shop sometime?

400
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,555
Okay.

401
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:08,377
- Good night.
- Good night.

402
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:15,210
I knew it!

403
00:18:24,818 --> 00:18:26,016
Uh...

404
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:29,360
Where were you?

405
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:31,493
Where were you?!

406
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,088
Some townies were trying to get us high,

407
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,214
and we didn't want to offend them,

408
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:38,640
because they're doing so well in life.

409
00:18:38,977 --> 00:18:40,766
Didn't want to burn a bridge.

410
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:44,939
Actually, those boys did
burn a bridge last summer.

411
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:47,469
Luckily they don't get
as bored as they used to.

412
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:49,592
Okay. Um...

413
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:53,071
So Jake... is into me.

414
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:54,923
Is he?

415
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,798
- Yeah!
- What makes you think that?

416
00:18:58,823 --> 00:19:02,516
Because we just necked
out behind the barn.

417
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:07,329
Seriously, what makes you think that?

418
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,399
Because we put our mouths together,

419
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:13,415
out behind the barn.

420
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:17,171
Just so you know, I kissed him too.

421
00:19:19,595 --> 00:19:20,946
Well, that didn't happen.

422
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:23,180
Who's to say?

423
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:26,571
Well, when would you
have had time to do that?

424
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,435
Did he invite you to his wood shop?

425
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,127
Sorry, that came out wrong.

426
00:19:43,526 --> 00:19:45,994
Smells like grass in here.

427
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:50,192
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God!

428
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:54,730
Okay, this is not okay! What
are you guys doing here?!

429
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:57,209
Shhh, Alexis!

430
00:19:57,234 --> 00:19:59,776
For once in your life Shhhh!

431
00:20:00,137 --> 00:20:02,905
I don't care what snarky
remarks you kids are gonna make

432
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,776
under your breath, tonight
we are dancing as a family.

433
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,479
What is happening?

434
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:17,353
Do you know your father and I

435
00:20:17,387 --> 00:20:20,502
hold great affection for the two of you?

436
00:20:21,124 --> 00:20:23,226
It may not always be obvious, but...

437
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,096
Just say it, Moira!

438
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:28,323
We love you both very much.

439
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:30,518
Love you too!

440
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:35,872
Love you too.

441
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:19,686

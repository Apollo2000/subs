1
00:00:00,996 --> 00:00:02,356
Agh!

2
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:07,250
Agh!

3
00:00:07,338 --> 00:00:09,601
Are you sure you don't
want any help with that?

4
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,056
I fit my high school best
friend into a suitcase

5
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:14,272
way smaller than this when
we were crossing the border

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,512
between Laos and Vietnam,

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,204
so I'm pretty sure
I can figure this out.

8
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:21,350
Ooh, I can't wait to get
to the Galapagos and like,

9
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:23,491
breathe the sea air
and get my...

10
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:24,554
Beach curls back.

11
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,668
Yeah, you've mentioned that
a couple times.

12
00:00:27,146 --> 00:00:28,749
Are you still trying
to close that thing?

13
00:00:28,836 --> 00:00:30,474
- Agh!
- Boys, it looks like

14
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:33,143
I won't be able to see that
wedding venue with you today,

15
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:34,755
your mother's had a bit
of a relapse.

16
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:36,800
Take it the "Crows" movie
is still shelved.

17
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:38,862
I'm sorry, we've started
looking at wedding venues

18
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,586
and no one chose to tell me?

19
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:43,535
Touring a wedding venue is
an incredibly intimate thing

20
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:45,069
and we wanted to keep it small.

21
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:46,300
You invited Dad.

22
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:49,260
Okay, I don't know what that's
supposed to mean, Alexis.

23
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:50,828
<i>John, something's
happening!</i>

24
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,917
Coming, Moira.
Don't make any sudden moves.

25
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:56,168
Okay, you should probably
stay here.

26
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:57,604
No, you shouldn't-
Okay.

27
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:03,739
John, remind me
to reprimand that latch,

28
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:05,869
it's been awfully moody today.

29
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:08,362
Well, good-good morning,
Sweetheart.

30
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:10,268
Look who's come to see you.

31
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:13,925
Finally. I'll have
the continental breakfast

32
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:16,997
with the fresh-squeezed
grapefruit juice.

33
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:18,850
Orange Pekoe tea.

34
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:21,636
No, Moira, Moira,
it's-it's David and Patrick.

35
00:01:21,717 --> 00:01:23,458
- Um?
- Don't we have something

36
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:24,959
- we want to say?
- Yes,

37
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:26,485
thank you, John.

38
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,814
Sadly, I won't be able
to squire you

39
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:33,073
for today's wedding venue
peregrination.

40
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,585
You invited Mom?

41
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:37,215
She's literally been asleep
in a closet for a week.

42
00:01:37,303 --> 00:01:39,218
Just know that missing this

43
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:42,593
will be the heavy-hearted
part of my day.

44
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:44,616
Okay, does nobody care
that I'm going to be gone

45
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,803
- for six months?
- Yes,

46
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,299
of course we care,
Honey.

47
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:49,536
- Don't we, Moira?
- Take me with you.

48
00:01:49,624 --> 00:01:50,778
Okay. On that note,

49
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:52,532
I think we should get you
out of the room.

50
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,900
Alexis, you are more than
welcome

51
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:56,902
- to come see the place with us.
- Thank you.

52
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,697
That actually works out super
well for me

53
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,015
because you guys
can just drive me, straight

54
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:02,692
to the airport after.
Hm-hm-hm.

55
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:05,584
- See what you've done there?
- Yeah.

56
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:07,691
Mhmm.
Out. Out, out, out.

57

59

<i>John! Can you turn off your
alarm?</i>

60
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:25,106
<i>David! I've asked you
not to over indulge</i>

61
00:02:25,194 --> 00:02:26,607
in that smoky cologne,

62
00:02:26,695 --> 00:02:29,306
<i>it's enough to give someone
a seizure!</i>

63
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:32,878
<i>Is someone vaping?</i>

64
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:36,147
<i>Oh no, not now!</i>

65
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:37,317
<i>Help!</i>

66
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:38,766
<i>Alexis!</i>

67
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:41,978
<i>No, this is not,
this is not how I go!</i>

68
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,790
<i>Somebody help!</i>

69
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:44,990
Moira!

70
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:46,754
Oh, Stevie, thank God.

71
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:49,528
I'm being annulled by
a chancy door clasp!

72
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:51,396
Okay, hang on.

73
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:52,484
Ahhh!

74
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:53,834
Okay, all right,
all right, okay.

75
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:55,717
Up, up. There we go.

76
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,663
Jeez, Moira,
I wait 'til at least 10:30

77
00:02:58,751 --> 00:02:59,893
before I have my first beer.

78
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:03,097
Oh, my legs are in slumber.
Carry me.

79
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:04,457
Oh I can't...

80
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:06,608
Oh jeez, okay.
Hang on.

81
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:10,556
You know, Moira, if Johnny
locked you in that closet,

82
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:12,440
we're going to have
to call the police.

83
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:15,220
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait.
My babies...

84
00:03:15,308 --> 00:03:16,912
- No, your kids aren't here.
- My girls.

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,901
- What girls?
- My girls.

86
00:03:17,988 --> 00:03:20,019
Lorna, second from the left.
Okay.

87
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:22,346
If she takes on smoke,
she'll never recover.

88
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:24,841
- Okay, this? This one?
- And Cindy!

89
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:28,243
Cindy, below her. Cindy,
I just gave her a blowout.

00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:43,448
Wow.
This place looks nice.

92
00:03:43,536 --> 00:03:45,228
Yeah, it's the only venue
for miles

93
00:03:45,316 --> 00:03:46,477
that doesn't look like
a crime scene

94
00:03:46,564 --> 00:03:48,676
from a missing person
docu-series.

95
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,924
Uh, so no one thought
to tell me

96
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,617
I still have my show
makeup on?

97
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,994
I thought that was a choice.

98
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:57,233
Yeah, I left Stevie
double-fisting drinks

99
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,870
in a hot tub at the cabaret
wrap party last night.

100
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,541
I think I saw you
triple-fisting at one point.

101
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:06,067
Ah, welcome
to Elmbridge Manor,

102
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:09,198
and you must be the happy
couple.

103
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:11,026
- Oh no, not quite.
- God, no.

104
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:14,204
Oh, ladies, I'm so sorry.
Congratulations.

105
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,158
- Champagne? - Thank you.
- Oh, thank you so much.

106
00:04:16,245 --> 00:04:17,381
Mhmm, hi.

107
00:04:17,977 --> 00:04:19,916
David Rose.
I'm the one getting married

108
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,663
and this is my partner,
Patrick.

109
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:22,491
- Hi.
- So.

110
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,873
Gentlemen,
please forgive me.

111
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:26,161
I looked at your friend's face

112
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:28,576
and thought someone had just
come from her make up trial.

113
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:32,024
Now, if our grooms and the...

114
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:35,782
uh, other couple
would like to follow me,

115
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,069
I will begin our tour.
Wonderful.

116
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,263
You look great.

117
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,729
All of our catering
is provided

118
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:47,727
by the neighbouring farm.

119
00:04:47,814 --> 00:04:51,600
We have fresh cheeses,
breads, meats.

120
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:55,310
Oh, now I do apologize
if the peonies back there

121
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:57,177
were a little overwhelming,

122
00:04:57,265 --> 00:05:00,109
it rained last night
and they just bloomed.

123
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:06,314
It's perfect.

124
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:09,546
David, I know you've made me
relinquish most,

125
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:11,835
if not all of the wedding
planning to you at this point,

126
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:13,448
but for what it's worth,

127
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:15,842
this place is beautiful.

128
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:18,997
- I think this is it.
- Mhmm.

129
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,502
I think this is it, guys!

130
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,632
See, David?

131
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:25,765
Imagine if I wasn't here
for this moment.

132
00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:28,135
Mhmm, okay.
Glad you're here.

133
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:30,358
So, do we have a winner?

134
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:33,117
If you're happy,
I'm happy.

135
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:36,638
We have a winner, Clive!

136
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:38,027
Yes!

137
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:42,115
It's a hell of a story,
Johnny.

138
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:44,024
So I'm next door,
I'm cleaning the bathroom

139
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:45,138
and I want a snack.

140
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:47,607
So I grab some of those jail
time toaster pops

141
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:48,934
and I put them
in the toaster,

142
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:51,264
- and suddenly there's a fire.
- Oh, Roland.

143
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:53,185
Why do they call them toaster
pops

144
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:55,924
if it says on the box,
"Do not toast"?

145
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:58,014
How mercurial is life?

146
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:01,415
We all imagine being
carried from the ashes

147
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:02,627
by the Goddess Artemis

148
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:06,573
and here I get a balatron
from Barnum and Bailey.

149
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,547
Okay. I...
I have no idea what that means,

150
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:11,029
but it doesn't sound good.

151
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:12,985
Okay, I'm gonna
go to lunch.

152
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:16,725
Gotta get this burnt toaster
pop taste out of my mouth.

153
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:18,267
Excuse me.

154
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,367
Moira. I'm just glad
you're okay.

155
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:22,386
Hm.

156
00:06:22,473 --> 00:06:23,344
And first thing
in the morning,

157
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:25,760
I'm going in and I'm fixing
these latches.

158
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:27,130
No need, John.

159
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:29,049
I have been gifted
a smoke signal

160
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:32,386
and you will never again find
me back in the closet.

161
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:35,486
Well, why don't we take
this one step at a time?

162
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:38,033
This may come as a shock
to you, dear, but...

163
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:42,491
I don't believe my career
has been that kind to me.

164
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,322
- What?
- I all but perished

165
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,321
in the name of an unrequited
love

166
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:51,795
for an industry that has burned
me over and over again.

167
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:54,766
It's been difficult watching
you go through this, Moira.

168
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:57,650
I know you'll want to fight
me tooth and nail, John.

169
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:02,965
It's time my career
took its final bow.

170
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,717
Now, if, if...

171
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:11,672
if that's what you want,
Moira,

172
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,359
just know that I'm here
if you need me for anything.

173
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:17,704
Oh, I have never
needed less.

174
00:07:18,593 --> 00:07:20,739
Shall we take lunch outside
today?

175
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:24,567
- What a great idea.
- Lay a blanket somewhere!

176
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:25,973
If you're feeling up for it,

177
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:28,157
I mean I, I, I know you're
still a bit shaken.

178
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:31,805
That's just it, John,
I have never felt more lucid.

179
00:07:31,988 --> 00:07:33,292
I'll fix a basket.

180
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,215
And I am including that
Peruvian ayahuasca retreat

181
00:07:36,303 --> 00:07:38,591
we embarked upon
with Al and Tipper.

182
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:40,442
Okay.

183
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:50,105
Okay, smiles over here please.

184
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:51,993
Ted wants to know
what we're doing.

185
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:56,219
Okay, like, a little less eager
and maybe one without Stevie.

186
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:57,317
- No offense.
- All right. Alexis,

187
00:07:57,404 --> 00:07:58,523
could you put the phone down?
You're gonn be

188
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,030
spending six
months with Ted,

189
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:02,375
I think the two of you can
chill for a minute.

190
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:06,172
Okay, this is our pricing
guide.

191
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:10,678
Starting with our gold,
silver, and bronze packages.

192
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:12,060
But, as you'll see,

193
00:08:12,148 --> 00:08:15,143
we can really accommodate
almost any request.

194
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,859
- Are these in dollars?
- Hm.

195
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:20,370
Okay, um...

196
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:24,198
is there a package lower
than the bronze package?

197
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:26,163
Perhaps a copper package?

198
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:29,348
No, we can't accommodate that.

199
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,493
Did you not ask to see
the prices in advance?

200
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:32,831
They don't provide...

201
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:35,052
We don't provide pricing
in advance.

202
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,658
Well, now we know why.

203
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:38,319
This might be the worst day
of my life.

204
00:08:38,406 --> 00:08:40,321
Okay, look.

205
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,927
You're clearly
very desperate

206
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:45,196
and I'm feeling terribly
for you.

207
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:46,652
I don't love the way
you phrase that.

208
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:51,227
Now, we did just have
a cancellation earlier

209
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:54,064
in the week for a Sunday
afternoon.

210
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,747
- Sundays are good.
- We can work with that.

211
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,425
Now, the first Sunday
of every month

212
00:08:57,513 --> 00:08:58,645
is discounted already

213
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:00,975
and we're unlikely
to find someone else

214
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:02,161
this late in the game.

215
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:06,339
So, I would be happy to offer
you an additional 30% off.

216
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:08,039
Oh my God!

217
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:11,870
Yes, but the only problem is:
it's a month from today.

218
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:14,546
This is basically free!

219
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:15,882
David, that's not enough time.

220
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,153
We need to give people notice.

221
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,106
Uh, I planned my ex
girlfriend's intervention

222
00:09:19,194 --> 00:09:20,275
in less than an hour.

223
00:09:20,363 --> 00:09:22,753
Plus, it'll weed out all
the dead weight.

224
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:26,145
Um... I will not be here
in one month,

225
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,886
so I guess that makes me
the dead weight?

226
00:09:31,214 --> 00:09:33,042
I'm feeling a little tension.

227
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:35,356
We're gonna find another
venue, okay?

228
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:36,975
We can't get married
without Alexis.

229
00:09:37,063 --> 00:09:39,485
Why? She's the one that can't
wait to get out of here.

230
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:42,250
I once dated someone who left
me for a stuffed animal.

231
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:44,466
- I'm not having my big day...
- Our...

232
00:09:44,554 --> 00:09:46,350
Our big day compromised

233
00:09:46,438 --> 00:09:50,417
because Alexis wanted to chill
in a tankini for six months.

234
00:09:53,985 --> 00:09:55,334
Honestly, David,

235
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:57,403
if this is the kind of bride
you're going to be,

236
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,388
I'm glad that I'm leaving.
Wha?

237
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:03,772
And I would never
wear a tankini!

238
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:10,285
Uh, just so you're aware,

239
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:13,473
that is house made bacon
from the farm up the road.

240
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,580
- Oh, give me this.
- Can... is that for everyone?

241
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:19,147
- Oh, Please, please.
- Oh my God.

242
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:27,813
Okay! God.

243
00:10:28,888 --> 00:10:30,944
Well, I guess congratulations
are in order.

244
00:10:31,032 --> 00:10:33,248
We didn't end up
taking the venue.

245
00:10:34,495 --> 00:10:36,205
Really? What stopped you?

246
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:38,785
Did they like,
run out of sandwiches or...?

247
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:41,046
Uh, yes.
But that's not why.

248
00:10:41,662 --> 00:10:45,277
We don't want to get married
without you here, okay?

249
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:47,399
- And?
- And, David?

250
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:51,053
And I didn't mean to make
you feel

251
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:52,709
excluded from the day.

252
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:55,327
Then again,
when all you talk about

253
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:56,950
is how excited you are
to get out of here,

254
00:10:57,037 --> 00:10:58,932
I don't really feel like
including you in stuff.

255
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,181
David, just say
you're sorry

256
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:01,924
so we can get your sister
to the airport, okay?

257
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:03,724
- Nevertheless...
- Mhmm.

258
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,225
I might have overreacted

259
00:11:06,327 --> 00:11:08,720
- and for that, I am apologetic.
- Wow.

260
00:11:09,644 --> 00:11:11,153
So, you're sorry.

261
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:13,156
I knew there was a reason
I came on this trip.

262
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:14,458
My God.

263
00:11:14,546 --> 00:11:16,365
I am remorseful

264
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,910
over an action
I participated in.

265
00:11:19,998 --> 00:11:21,290
- Hmm.
- Dammit!

266
00:11:21,378 --> 00:11:22,593
What is going on?

267
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,089
- Car won't start.
- What?!

268
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:25,843
Well, I can't be late
for my flight!

269
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:27,329
Okay, well why don't you
go inside

270
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:28,506
and ask Clive for help then?

271
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:30,334
Because my feet
are killing me, David.

272
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:32,428
- Oh my God!
- Why don't we go inside

273
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:34,264
and see if there's anything
Clive can do, okay?

274
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:36,482
Why do I feel like Clive
doesn't handle stress well?

275
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:38,269
Come on.

276
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:40,056
This might be a stupid
question,

277
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:43,321
but why are you wearing high
heels on an airplane?

278
00:11:43,456 --> 00:11:45,022
Oh, I'm not wearing them on
the plane,

279
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,151
they hand out slippers
with the mimosas.

280
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:49,623
When was the last time
you flew economy?

281
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:50,886
Hmm?

282
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:58,079
Hard to believe this is our
first trip down to the creek.

283
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:00,988
You know, Moira,
after the week we've had,

284
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:03,637
this is the perfect way
to end it.

285
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:06,424
To think I nearly made you
a widower.

286
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:08,317
Oh, John,
I can just see you

287
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:10,320
aimlessly wandering
through life.

288
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:12,749
Stoic but stymied,

289
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:15,744
not a friend in the world
and so very lost.

290
00:12:15,832 --> 00:12:17,597
Well, you're here now,
Moira,

291
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:19,456
and... so am I.

292
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:21,498
And, with your career
behind you,

293
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:22,920
we'll be able to

294
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:25,342
take advantage
of more days like this.

295
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,812
Does this not remind you
of that wellness retreat

296
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,337
we went to in Evian,

297
00:12:30,424 --> 00:12:33,209
right after Alexis ended
things with Sean Penn?

298
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:36,552
Yes. You and I wandered down
to the lake,

299
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:38,977
ne'ery a person to be found.

300
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:40,978
Bid adieu to our clothing

301
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:43,320
and let the cool sting
of the mineral water

302
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:45,594
remind us that we were,
in fact,

303
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:47,706
alive and well.

304
00:12:47,794 --> 00:12:50,495
I lost my Patek Philippe
in that lake,

305
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:53,641
but I wouldn't have had it
any other way.

306
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:57,152
We seem to have found
ourselves alone again,

307
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,345
Mr. Rose.

308
00:12:58,617 --> 00:13:01,308
- Moira, that was 15 years ago!
- Mmhm?

309
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:02,611
What if someone sees us?

310
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,105
Who knows what will befall us
tomorrow, John?

311
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:07,374
You could be hit
by a Mack truck,

312
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:10,572
or bopped on the head by
a tiny piece of space debris!

313
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,344
I don't know,
it feels risky.

314
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:15,529
Let me just attend
to one thing first.

315
00:13:15,617 --> 00:13:17,475
Moira, whatever it is can
wait.

316
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,146
No, no. Before we re-baptize
ourselves

317
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:22,673
I'm going to call my agent
and make it official!

318
00:13:22,854 --> 00:13:25,047
Moira Rose is tech un-avail,

319
00:13:25,143 --> 00:13:27,184
she has a life to live.

320
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:29,290
I'm proud of you,
Sweetheart.

321
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:32,954
You just remove those
vetements, Mr. Rose,

322
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:35,362
I'll be back in the shake
of a lamb's rump.

323
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,982
As soon as I find a signal.

324
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:46,880
Ugh! Ugh!
Uh! Like...

325
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:53,390
- What's going on over there?
- I'm trying to check in!

326
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:54,922
If we're going to be late,
I'm going to at least do

327
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:56,581
everything I can
to not miss my flight,

328
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,049
because I have never needed
a vacation more.

329
00:13:59,168 --> 00:14:00,431
Yeah, this?

330
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:03,106
I think this is what might be
bothering your brother.

331
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,030
Okay, I get it,
my life is an inconvenience.

332
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:07,810
That. Um,

333
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,958
or the fact that you've been
talking nonstop

334
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:12,394
about how desperate
you are to get out of here?

335
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:15,206
I think it might be hurting
his feelings.

336
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:18,019
Okay. I'm moving to a place
that doesn't have a Sephora

337
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,362
for literally 2700 miles,

338
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,269
so I'm sorry if I'm trying
to convince myself

339
00:14:22,357 --> 00:14:23,772
that I'm doing
the right thing.

340
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:26,843
I might still be
a bit boozy,

341
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:29,238
- Yes, I can confirm that.
- But...

342
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:33,742
I've actually been jealous
of your trip.

343
00:14:34,596 --> 00:14:37,396
Like, you're getting out there,

344
00:14:37,484 --> 00:14:38,811
seeing the world.

345
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,639
And now that
Cabaret's over,

346
00:14:40,735 --> 00:14:44,254
I feel like I might need
to be doing more of that.

347
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:46,780
I just wish I had your...

348
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:49,482
what's going on?

349
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:50,832
Because I think
I might be

350
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,136
in the middle of giving you
a compliment

351
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:53,509
- for the first time, so.
- Yes,

352
00:14:53,597 --> 00:14:55,258
and I am super touched,
it's just that

353
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,330
I'm having trouble getting
my boarding pass.

354
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,562
Like, do they not let people
in economy check in

355
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,794
for the flight?

356
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,662
Can I see your phone?

357
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:09,406
Okay. Um, think I've found
the problem;

358
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:12,271
your flight's not leaving
for another month.

359
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,848
What?! Give me that!

360
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:18,098
No, it says right here,
0-7-0-8.

361
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:21,072
Yeah, but it's day before
month,

362
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,772
so you're not leaving
on July 8th,

363
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,800
you're leaving on August 7th.
What?

364
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:27,338
Why it's so?

365
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,802
Ugh, and my stupid ticket
doesn't allow for any changes.

366
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,711
Ugh!
What am I supposed to do?

367
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:35,854
Well, maybe you could start
by telling David

368
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:38,176
that you messed up and he can
book the venue after all!

369
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:40,434
Okay, I would literally
rather sleep at the airport

370
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,118
- for a month.
- Yeah.

371
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:43,651
Can you hear me now?

372
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:45,804
No, I'm not blocking
the microphone

373
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:47,585
with my finger anymore!

374
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:49,954
Okay, no I was.

375
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,131
Now... yes?

376
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:54,790
Oh, well, what would the back
end look like

377
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:56,023
on a deal like that?

378
00:15:56,642 --> 00:15:59,931
Oh, I see, what an emphatically
Kismetic

379
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:01,767
turn of events.
Oh, John's here now.

380
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:04,550
Okay, talk soon. Kisses!

381
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,504
Johnathan, have we found
ourselves a new friend?

382
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,926
- Hmm.
- Hello ma'am,

383
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:11,260
I'm Officer Cornwall.

384
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:13,397
I was off duty when I came
across this man

385
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:16,075
in a state of undress,
down by the creek.

386
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:17,975
He claims to be
your husband?

387
00:16:18,252 --> 00:16:19,563
Last I checked,

388
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:21,580
a decades-long successful
marriage

389
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:23,305
is not a criminal offence.

390
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:24,832
No, no it is not.

391
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:27,271
However, indecent exposure
certainly is.

392
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:30,631
I found your husband sunning
himself in the creek,

393
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,506
like he was in some
Grecian bath.

394
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:34,711
No, I don't think we need
to editorialize.

395
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:36,700
John, I'm so sorry,

396
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,743
I was engrossed in a very
stirring phone call.

397
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:42,913
Officer, perhaps we could
arrange a plea bargain?

398
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,694
Well, since I wasn't supposed
to be fly fishing

399
00:16:45,782 --> 00:16:47,530
at this end of the creek...

400
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:50,039
I think we can leave it
at a warning.

401
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:51,162
Oh, thank you, Officer,

402
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:53,519
for your almost militant
commitment

403
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:55,819
to the protection
of our community.

404
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:59,097
I promise to keep my husband
habilimented from now on.

405
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:05,120
John, you won't believe
what's happened!

406
00:17:05,247 --> 00:17:08,178
What happened was,
you left me alone,

407
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:10,053
struggling to get out
of a creek!

408
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:11,562
The algae was so slippery,

409
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,477
the cop had to throw me
his fishing line.

410
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,386
Well, button back up your
birthday tux, John,

411
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:18,407
because I've just found out
the "Crows" movie

412
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:20,627
is back in business!

413
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:22,106
What?

414
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:25,045
Yes! Apparently it's been
picked up by Interflex,

415
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:26,676
a brand new streaming service.

416
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:28,526
Can you believe that?

417
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:31,416
Moira, you were just saying
what a relief

418
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,617
it was to have
the ups and downs of your career

419
00:17:33,705 --> 00:17:35,247
- behind you, and...
- I know, right?

420
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:36,899
How serendipitous is this?

421
00:17:37,078 --> 00:17:39,528
At the precise moment I choose
to walk away,

422
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:43,056
the industry comes crawling
back to me on all fours.

423
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:45,693
I just worry about the next time
it's not great news.

424
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:47,489
A new day has dawned.

425
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:51,462
It took my accepting that
I could quit at any time

426
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,466
to realize I musn't, John.
Ever.

427
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,224
If this is what you
really want, then I'm...

428
00:18:00,231 --> 00:18:02,847
I'm happy for you.
Thank you, John.

429
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:06,200
It appears officer fly fish has
taken his leave,

430
00:18:06,288 --> 00:18:07,638
how about that dip?

431
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:10,331
Oh, I think the moment
has passed.

432
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:14,367
Okay, roadside assistance

433
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:16,117
isn't gonna be here
for the next hour,

434
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:17,585
so we're going to call you
a cab.

435
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:20,047
And Clive didn't have jumper
cables because he doesn't drive

436
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:21,775
because he's scared
of car horns.

437
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:23,170
Okay, um, David?

438
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:26,236
I also have something that
I would like to say to you

439
00:18:26,324 --> 00:18:27,559
as well.

440
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:30,209
Okay?

441
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:33,615
I am sorry also,

442
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:36,286
for rubbing my trip
in your face.

443
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,163
The truth is,

444
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:40,394
is that I'm really
gonna miss you.

445
00:18:42,803 --> 00:18:44,152
Thank you.

446
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,705
I'm going to miss you,
as well.

447
00:18:48,366 --> 00:18:50,635
And I just feel so bad
about standing in the way

448
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:52,806
- of your dream wedding.
- Oh...

449
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:54,665
But maybe I should just, like,

450
00:18:54,831 --> 00:18:57,318
- push my trip back by a month.
- Wow.

451
00:18:57,406 --> 00:18:58,420
Okay.

452
00:18:58,557 --> 00:19:00,885
I am not having you push your
trip back.

453
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,164
No, I insist.

454
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,536
What's going on?

455
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:11,085
Nothing, David,
just accept your wedding gift.

456
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:12,668
- Patrick, call a cab, please.
- 'Kay.

457
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:14,971
- Okay, no, don't call a cab!
- Ugh.

458
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:17,958
- My flight got delayed.
- Delayed by a month?

459
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:19,562
This is like watching
a car crash.

460
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,398
Ugh.

461
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:22,178
You mixed up the day and the
month on your ticket again,

462
00:19:22,265 --> 00:19:23,997
didn't you?
No! I... no.

463
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:25,689
Like that time you showed up
to Kate Winslet's wedding

464
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:26,361
a month late.

465
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:28,024
The calligraphy
was hard to read

466
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:29,897
and Billy Zane also did
the same thing, David.

467
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:33,490
- Unbelievable.
- Okay, well the upside

468
00:19:33,578 --> 00:19:35,848
is that you guys can now
take the place,

469
00:19:35,936 --> 00:19:37,981
so actually,
you're welcome.

470
00:19:38,631 --> 00:19:39,983
She's right, David.

471
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,433
We could go back
and talk to Clive.

472
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:46,948
Do we go back
and talk to Clive?!

473
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:48,383
Ew.

474
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:50,572
- Oh my God.
- What is that?

475
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,566
It's like a thousand
babies teething.

476
00:19:52,654 --> 00:19:54,497
Didn't he say there was
a farm up the road?

477
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:55,651
Uh, that is correct.

478
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,986
They process their pork

479
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,511
on the first Sunday
of every month,

480
00:19:59,654 --> 00:20:01,222
hence our discounted rates.

481
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,935
Did I hear that the wedding
was back on?

482
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:05,667
Hey. This is not a winner,
Clive.

483
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:07,986
Okay. I can't stop
hearing it!

484
00:20:11,365 --> 00:20:13,382
It sounded like a thousand
guinea pigs

485
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,535
were being shoved into
a wood chipper.

486
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:17,251
- Pork chops?
- Oh, no thank you.

487
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:18,419
I'll have my later, thanks.

488
00:20:18,507 --> 00:20:19,893
Well, it sounds to me
like you two

489
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,669
dodged a bacon-wrapped bullet.
I'll say it again:

490
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:26,101
life is but a strand
of happy accidents.

491
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:27,500
You've never said
that before.

492
00:20:27,588 --> 00:20:29,931
It's such great news
about the film, Mrs. Rose.

493
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:31,053
Interflex is huge.

494
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:33,194
Oh, wait 'til
our movie drops.

495
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:36,525
So, I just talked to Ted.

496
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:37,998
He's devastated,
obviously,

497
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:40,226
but he did say that it's
probably for the best

498
00:20:40,314 --> 00:20:42,619
because he still hasn't
lizard-proofed his place

499
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:45,312
and I have absolutely no desire
to be there until that happens.

500
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,393
You see? Further proof
that life is but a...

501
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:48,878
- Okay. We get it.
- Strand.

502
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:51,373
Well, I, for one,
am happy to have you

503
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:54,323
- for another month, Alexis. - Hey,
- <i>Thank you.</i>

504
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:55,871
What if we got married
here?

505
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,937
What if we got married
under a highway overpass?

506
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,430
I'm serious.

507
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:01,594
This place means something
to you guys.

508
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:03,677
Put a tent in the back,
string up some lights.

509
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:05,071
You could make it beautiful.

510
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:09,761
- I'll think about it.
- Okay.

511
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:11,252
Oh, in other news:

512
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,963
your father was arrested
for indecent exposure.

513
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:16,933
- Ew, I'm eating!
- Moira.

514
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:19,224
Okay. There's no backing out
now!

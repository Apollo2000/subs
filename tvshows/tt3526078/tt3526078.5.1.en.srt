(Cell phone rings)

2
00:00:04,508 --> 00:00:06,873
Johnny: Kids! Your
mother's on the phone,

3
00:00:06,898 --> 00:00:08,365
and it's her first day on set,

4
00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:10,660
so let's all make sure we
keep her spirits high, okay?

5
00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:11,728
Alexis, come on.

6
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:13,430
Mr. Rose, I think you should answer it.

7
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:14,809
Yeah, she's over there all by herself,

8
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,165
so it's gotta be stressful, right?

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,144
- I mean, the jet lag, and...
- Oh my God, answer the phone!

10
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:19,747
- That's why-that's why...
- Answer the phone, please!

11
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:21,515
Put her on speaker, how
do you put her on speaker?

12
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,882
- Arghhh!
- Speaker, speaker.

13
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:24,773
Yeah, hello? Moira?

14
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:27,109
- _
- Moira: John? Hello? Hello?

15
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:30,212
<i>Moira? David, I don't
think she can hear me!</i>

16
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:31,880
John, are you there?

17
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:33,949
<i>Yeah, I'm here, everybody's here.</i>

18
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:36,285
<i>I expected to hear from you yesterday.</i>

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,186
Kids, say hi to your mother.

20
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:39,455
- Hey.
- Hi...

21
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,124
- She-she's not my mother.
- Who are those voices?

22
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,648
Uh, your children!

23
00:00:43,673 --> 00:00:46,262
<i>Oh Alexis, do you have strep again?</i>

24
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:48,497
- That was David!
- Is that Stevie?

25
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:49,632
Hi.

26
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,400
David! Oh, David, how's the store?

27
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:54,403
Any new customers, or
is it still friendless?

28
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:55,704
Okay, thank you.

29
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,574
And John, I know disoriented
you get in my absence.

30
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:00,842
Don't forget I left
you that Sudoku book.

31
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:02,623
Yeah, well, I haven't
needed it sweetheart,

32
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:04,246
because I've been up since 5:00am,

33
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:06,581
there's so much to do here at the motel.

34
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:08,483
But listen, how are you doing?

35
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:10,718
I mean, how does it feel
to be back in the saddle?

36
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:13,188
<i>Oh John, there's a sweetness in the air,</i>

37
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:14,389
<i>and I'm not just saying that</i>

38
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:17,458
because we shoot next
to a baklava factory.

39
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,693
(Snapping) Kids!

40
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:21,629
Do you wanna put those
magazines back, please?!

41
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,265
No. (Knock on door)

42
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,867
Excellent, Hamza!
Darlings, I must sign off.

43
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:28,003
I'm finally getting my
tete-a-tete with the director.

44
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:31,306
He's some up-and-coming pretty
young thing out of New York.

45
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,908
Well, sounds like your kind of people.

46
00:01:32,943 --> 00:01:34,609
Yes! You come up with some real money,

47
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:36,344
you can attract the best.

48
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:37,779
Well, zbogom, John!

49
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:39,380
That's goodbye in the mother tongue!

50
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,249
Okay, well, I'll sign
off too, sweetheart.

51
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:43,518
Lots to do, but wishing
you an exciting...

52
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:45,687
(Call beeps off)

53
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:47,955
Okay, yep. Miss you, too.

54
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,324
She already hung up.

55
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,925
Oh! Burn, Dad!

56
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,104
Oh my God that's so embarrassing,

57
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,195
you must feel ridiculous.

58
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,963
You better remember
which nails you pulled

59
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:58,433
those wigs from, because your
mother keeps a spreadsheet.

- David? Come here, please.
- (Gasps)

62
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:11,346
- I have a concern.
- Oh! Um, no.

63
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,548
Your natural deodorant isn't working.

64
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,416
Stop, David! No, come here.

65
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:16,951
- Sit!
- What?

66
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,333
- Um...
- What?!

67
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,101
I just wanted to make sure
that everything was okay

68
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,640
between you and Patrick.

69
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:29,503
Yeah! Why? Why? What did...
what did he say to you?

70
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:31,365
No, nothing. I just got...

71
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,834
scared when I saw your score
on this relationship quiz.

72
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:35,134
Oh my God!

73
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,481
Because according to M'Lady Magazine,

74
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:38,049
"How Electric is your Relationship" quiz

75
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:40,640
from summer 1991, you and Patrick

76
00:02:40,676 --> 00:02:43,577
are "In Need of a
Generator!" Poor thing!

77
00:02:43,612 --> 00:02:46,913
Okay, first of all,
it's Major Lady Magazine,

78
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:49,483
and second of all, that quiz is garbage.

79
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:50,917
Mm, totally, David.

80
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:53,520
This garbage quiz that it looks
like you took more than once.

81
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:56,590
Yeah, because it's rigged.
You could take it 1000 times

82
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,902
you'd still get the same outcome.

83
00:02:57,926 --> 00:02:59,459
Oh, it's okay, David.

84
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:01,138
You and Patrick have
settled in to that like,

85
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:03,530
nine to five life, so
things are probably starting

86
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:05,599
to feel a little snooze-town.

87
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:09,168
You're dating a vet who
irons his polo shirts.

88
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:12,138
Um, Ted and I got
"Electrical Storm." So.

89
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:16,075
That's impossible. What
did you do to get that?

90
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:18,611
Did you plug your hairdryer
in with wet hands again?

91
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:21,680
Hey, that happened
twice David, let it go.

92
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:24,517
Sorry that we work hard
to keep the sparks flying.

93
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:25,919
That's disgusting.

94
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:27,965
We've actually started taking
every Friday afternoon off

95
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,672
to go on "adventure dates."

96
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:34,493
"Adventure dates" sound like
something a marriage counselor

97
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:36,495
would proscribe as a last resort.

98
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:38,431
Okay, fine... I was gonna see

99
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:40,011
if you guys wanted to
join us this afternoon,

100
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:42,201
but you probably have
more exciting things to do,

101
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:45,338
like put price tags on things, and...

102
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:47,506
It's merchandising day, actually.

103
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:49,398
Oh!

104
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:51,410
Where are you going, anyway?

105
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:53,578
Ted booked a tour of Elm Falls Park,

106
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:55,613
which is like, a super cute look for us.

107
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:56,729
Sounds dumb.

108
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:00,052
Fine, text me the information,

109
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:01,886
and I'll see if we're interested.

110
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:04,256
Oh! David? It could be worse.

111
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,955
You guys could be a
"Total Power Failure."

112
00:04:07,194 --> 00:04:08,971
Mm! Eat glass.

113
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:11,997
(Door slams)

114
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:14,566
Caw! Caw! My teamster brethren!

115
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:17,202
Yes, it's me, if you can believe it!

(Door latch clicks)

121
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:36,705
Okay, I told the producers

122
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,331
I would approve background on set.

123
00:04:39,356 --> 00:04:42,691
Oh! And I shall tell them the same.

124
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:46,197
You must be Blaire. No last name.

125
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:48,900
Doctor Clara Beatrice
Mandrake at your service.

126
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:51,870
Middle name wasn't scripted,
but I've done my homework.

127
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:54,768
Okay. So, you're Rose, then?

128
00:04:55,074 --> 00:04:58,370
Moira Rose. And I see
what's happening here.

129
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:02,357
Break me down just to build me up again!

130
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:04,581
Like Stan Kubrick did to Shelley.

131
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:07,385
Okay, I'm not really into games,

132
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,721
and I'm due on set in an hour,

133
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:12,023
so can whatever this
is can wait 'til then?

134
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:15,059
I imagine script revisions
might be something

135
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:16,327
you'd like to sign off on

136
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:18,262
before the first clap of the boards.

137
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:20,245
There's a problem with the script?

138
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,401
Well, just a few character adjustments.

139
00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:25,369
(Laughs) I'm kidding.

140
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:27,745
The script's a total
dumpster fire, of course.

141
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:30,441
Hah! If the script were garbage,

142
00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:32,343
I don't believe we'd have signed on.

143
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:35,112
It's an apocalyptic
fantasy about mutant crows.

144
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:36,914
I think we all know
what we're making here.

145
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,350
A timely allegory about prejudice.

146
00:05:39,385 --> 00:05:42,053
- Okay, Maura, is it?
- Moira.

147
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:45,022
My last picture was a $50
million dollar studio project.

148
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:48,417
I think it's safe to say
that this is not that.

149
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:51,028
And what exactly is this to you, then?

150
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:52,784
A trip to Bora Bora.

151
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:55,854
I see. Bora Bora.

152
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:58,568
Caroline Kennedy once
called it the Atlantic City

153
00:05:58,603 --> 00:06:00,417
of French Polynesia.

154
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,949
Okay, let's just cash our paychecks,

155
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:05,557
and pray no one ever sees this, yeah?

I'm just here to submit
my letter of resignation.

160
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:17,853
Okay, you can just leave
it right here on the desk.

161
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:19,655
Well, I haven't actually written it yet.

162
00:06:19,691 --> 00:06:22,559
But I guess I can just
dictate it to you right now.

163
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:24,427
Um, "To whom it may concern."

164
00:06:24,463 --> 00:06:27,197
Sorry Roland, why
exactly are you quitting?

165
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:29,210
Well, I would rather quit
than come in here every day

166
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:30,694
and be humiliated!

167
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:32,547
I mean, I come to work,
and Johnny's out there

168
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:34,204
doing all my jobs!

169
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,938
Yeah, he's been... buzzing around

170
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:38,248
- ever since Mrs. Rose left.
- Yeah, exactly!

171
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:39,642
I mean, come on, what's next?

172
00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:42,544
I go home and he's playing
strip backgammon with my wife?

173
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,013
(Laughs) Come on!

174
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:46,348
- No, don't talk to me.
- Yeah.

175
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:47,683
I-I mean, I look in the mirror

176
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:49,551
and it's Johnny's face
staring back at me?

177
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:51,220
Got it, Roland. I'll talk to him.

178
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:53,030
Okay, well, I'll go with you.

179
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:56,592
Oh, look! This guy's
wearing a work shirt.

180
00:06:56,628 --> 00:06:58,327
He's even copping my look now!

181
00:06:58,362 --> 00:06:59,895
(Scoffs)

182
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:01,038
Uh...

183
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:03,699
What ya doin' there, Mr. Rose?

184
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:06,535
Oh, I noticed there was a bit
of blockage in the gutters.

185
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,437
But um...

186
00:07:08,472 --> 00:07:10,506
Roland's in charge of doing the gutters.

187
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,441
Yeah, I'm the gutter guy, Johnny.

188
00:07:12,476 --> 00:07:14,209
Everybody knows I'm the gutter guy!

189
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:16,045
Well, it was on the
to-do list for today.

190
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,980
Yeah, it was on my to-do list!

191
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:19,626
What are you gonna do
next, the bathrooms?!

192
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,927
No, I haven't done the bathrooms.

193
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:23,317
Jeez, I wouldn't mind
if he did the bathrooms.

194
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:26,121
Uh, is everything okay, Mr. Rose?

195
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:28,835
Yeah, never felt better.
I feel invigorated!

196
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:31,137
Well, maybe you can move
on to cleaning the windows,

197
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:32,761
and give Roland his job back?

198
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:34,896
Well, I've already done the windows.

199
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:37,231
It looks like Roland might
have to find some other work.

200
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:40,001
Oh jeez. Find some other
work, do you hear him?

201
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:42,103
What's gonna happen next?
I go to my dermatologist,

202
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,305
and Johnny's there
getting my moles checked?

203
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,641
Stevie: Point made Roland, thank you.

204
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:48,009
(Bell on door jingles)

205
00:07:48,045 --> 00:07:50,611
(Soft Jazz music plays)

206
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,375
- Oh hi.
- Hi.

207
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:02,623
Have I ever told you how
sexy it is to walk in here

208
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:05,459
and see you doing um...

209
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:07,562
inventory?

210
00:08:07,597 --> 00:08:11,546
And wearing those little
rubber thimbles on your fingers?

211
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:13,999
They help me flip the pages easier.

212
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:17,155
Hot. Hot sex.

213
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:20,249
You know what else is hot and sexy?

214
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:23,477
Doing something
spontaneous this afternoon.

215
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:25,346
Ooh, like what?

216
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,429
You helping me with the inventory?

217
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:30,132
Yes. Or...

218
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,687
taking the afternoon off.

219
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:34,577
Mixing up the nine to five.

220
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:36,490
Okay...

221
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:38,326
well, nine to five are our store hours.

222
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:41,160
So it's kinda hard to
build customer loyalty

223
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:43,763
when your store is just like,
spontaneously open or closed.

224
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:46,633
Yeah. Anyway, it turns out

225
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:49,202
Alexis's relationship is in trouble.

226
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,903
- What?
- Yeah, I know.

227
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:53,607
Struggling. She practically
begged us to join them

228
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:55,475
at the park this afternoon,

229
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,009
probably for emotional support.

230
00:08:57,045 --> 00:08:58,823
Wow, we just saw them,
they seemed totally fine.

231
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:00,313
I know. Yeah.

232
00:09:00,349 --> 00:09:02,514
Well, they're in need of a generator,

233
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,065
if you know what I mean.

234
00:09:04,552 --> 00:09:06,151
Well, I don't, but uh...

235
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:07,631
if you think it'll help a bad situation,

236
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:09,755
I guess we could duck
out a little early today.

237
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,602
It will just mean we'll
have to start early tomorrow.

238
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:12,893
Mhmm.

239
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:17,062
You know, it's that unshakable
sense of responsibility

240
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:19,643
that... makes me wanna just...

241
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:23,135
rip those little rubber things,

242
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,704
and... burn 'em in a fire.

243
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,005
(Laughs)

244
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:29,870
(Groans)

245
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,747
Johnny: Twyla, can I get a
lunch special to go, please?

246
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:36,573
- Sure.
- Okay.

247
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,752
Oh! So no one thought to tell me

248
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,552
about the team lunch today?

249
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:42,920
Oh, we tried.

250
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:45,856
You just couldn't hear us over
the sound of the lawnmower.

251
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:48,559
Yeah, lawnmower, as in mowing the lawn,

252
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:50,561
which is also my job.

253
00:09:50,597 --> 00:09:53,464
Am I supposed to be reading
between the lines here?

254
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,001
Well, I think we were just
wondering if maybe the fact

255
00:09:57,036 --> 00:10:01,015
that you're so
invigorated to work lately

256
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,508
is because Mrs. Rose is gone,

257
00:10:03,543 --> 00:10:05,075
and you're trying to fill a...

258
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:07,812
Fill a big, black
empty hole in your life.

259
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:10,348
Is that pretty much what you
were trying to say there, Stevie?

260
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:11,982
Maybe not quite like that, but...

261
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:14,985
Okay, if you're suggesting...
that my work ethic

262
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,265
has anything to do
with... Oh, it's Moira!

263
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,721
I gotta to take this.

264
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:20,724
Moira, what's the good word?

265
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:24,295
Oh John, I'm afraid I've made
a grave error in judgment.

266
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,264
Oh sweetheart, I told you
not to drink the tap water.

267
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,534
If only! At this moment
an intestinal bacteria

268
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:32,736
would wreak less havoc on my career!

269
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:33,938
Well, I don't understand.

270
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:35,840
Everything was fine two hours ago.

271
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,542
John, you know me, I'm
never one to complain.

272
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:41,078
I didn't bat an eye when I
found out my accommodation

273
00:10:41,113 --> 00:10:44,748
here was in actuality a
small "Bed or Breakfast."

274
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:46,616
They feed me at work, I'll take the bed.

275
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:47,952
So then what's the problem?

276
00:10:47,987 --> 00:10:51,155
Our director appears to
be on a kamikaze mission

277
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,289
to sink this ship,

278
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:54,958
and I refuse to be the
goddess on its prow!

279
00:10:54,993 --> 00:10:57,927
Well, if you're not enjoying
yourself anymore sweetheart,

280
00:10:57,963 --> 00:10:59,663
<i>then coming home is always an option.</i>

281
00:10:59,698 --> 00:11:01,598
I mean, you must be missing your family.

282
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:05,235
Oh, thank you, John, but that's not it.

283
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,605
This was supposed to
be my comeback vehicle,

284
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,407
and opportunities like this

285
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:12,843
come along ever so infrequently.

286
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:18,682
Well, Moira,

287
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:20,831
I feel the answer is
right in front of you.

288
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:24,220
This isn't some rinky-dink
made-for-TV movie,

289
00:11:24,256 --> 00:11:27,723
or a voice gig for an X-rated
Japanese video game.

290
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,958
That-that was rated
"M" for "Mature," John.

291
00:11:29,994 --> 00:11:33,362
All I'm saying is you
have an opportunity here.

292
00:11:33,398 --> 00:11:36,503
And if you want it bad enough,
you've gotta fight for it.

293
00:11:37,862 --> 00:11:39,751
You're right. You're right!

294
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:41,370
If Sandy Bullock hadn't fought

295
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:43,372
to keep the Speed Franchise alive,

296
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:45,508
we never would've had "Cruise Control".

297
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:46,876
<i>John, thank you.</i>

298
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:49,111
I would be lost without you.

299
00:11:49,146 --> 00:11:51,079
(Kiss sound, beeps call off)

300
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:53,289
Me too.

301
00:11:56,993 --> 00:11:58,387
Everything okay?

302
00:11:58,423 --> 00:11:59,988
Yeah, everything's good, Stevie.

303
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:02,968
Everything's good. So
I'm gonna head back,

304
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:06,694
uh, but you can brainstorm
some things for Roland to do.

305
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,563
And if not, I have a window later,

306
00:12:08,598 --> 00:12:11,069
so I can take the job on if you like.

307
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:12,667
Just so you're aware, Mr. Rose,

308
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:14,836
the special is cream of mushroom soup.

309
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:16,749
We don't actually have
to-go containers for that,

310
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:18,446
so I've just double-bagged it.

311
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,404
Would you like a spoon, or a straw?

312
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:28,798
(Birds chirp)

313
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,381
I have to say, David,
I'm a little shocked

314
00:12:32,405 --> 00:12:33,504
that you agreed to do this,

315
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:35,106
I know how fearful you are of heights.

316
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:36,940
Hmm. Well, "fearful" makes me

317
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:39,710
sound like some Dickensian
orphan with a chronic illness.

318
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:41,345
It's more an aversion.

319
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,582
Yeah, do I wish that Alexis
was a little more specific

320
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:46,683
when she said we were coming to a park?

321
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:50,631
Uh maybe, but this, this is
gonna be fun, I think for us.

322
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:52,256
- You know?
- Yeah.

323
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,625
David, you look so cute under there!

324
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:56,701
Like a tiny toadstool man,

325
00:12:56,729 --> 00:12:59,096
or a little acorn person, or something.

326
00:12:59,132 --> 00:13:01,464
Hey! So glad you guys could make it!

327
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,798
I hope you didn't have to like,

328
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:05,135
rearrange your daily
schedule, or anything, hm?

329
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,680
Oh, no, no, no, we just agreed to finish

330
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:08,338
doing the inventory tomorrow.

331
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:10,640
Mm, that's a sensible decision.

332
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:11,680
Yeah.

333
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,689
They look like they're really
enjoying each other's company.

334
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:17,847
Yeah, they fake it well.

335
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:20,583
I actually did one of
these at summer camp.

336
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:22,796
Yeah, and I couldn't imagine
who wouldn't want to dangle

337
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,121
20 feet in the air on
a series of shaky logs.

338
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:27,563
It's actually closer to 30 feet, bud.

339
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:29,403
David's never done
anything like this before.

340
00:13:29,427 --> 00:13:33,072
- Uh oh, we've got a virgin!
- Okay,

341
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:36,565
you might wanna talk to half
my birthright trip about that.

342
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,962
All right, do you wanna go first, babe?

343
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:41,610
- Hundred, babe.
- Oh okay, there we go!

344
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,472
Hey. Mm!

345
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:46,542
All right.

346
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:48,944
You feeling okay, David?

347
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,646
You're looking a little flushed.

348
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:53,415
No, just using a new tinted
moisturizer, that's all.

349
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,151
It's all right.

350
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:56,852
- I guess I'll go.
- (Laughs) All right!

351
00:13:56,888 --> 00:13:58,298
This will be a fun adventure for us.

352
00:13:58,322 --> 00:13:59,421
Yes...

353
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:01,724
Get the clip off, and
you're ready to go.

354
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,040
- Babe!
- Whoa, great job, babe!

355
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:06,929
David!

356
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:10,989
David!
- Stop!

357
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:12,681
(David whimpers)

358
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:15,136
None of my phone chargers are working!

359
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:16,871
I ask for a pressed juice,

360
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:18,773
and all I get are blank stares.

361
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:20,508
Look, I just find it hard to believe

362
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:22,877
that this was the best
gig you could've gotten me.

363
00:14:22,913 --> 00:14:25,554
Get my days down! Yeah. Hi.

364
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:26,581
- Hello, again.
- Hi.

365
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,516
I was hoping this might
be an opportune moment

366
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:29,918
to discuss the quagmire

367
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,721
in which you fancy yourself ensnared?

368
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:34,089
The what to the what now?

369
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:37,348
I suspect you're viewing
this enterprise as a barrier

370
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:39,694
rather than a gateway to
the future of your career.

371
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,262
Yeah, you really don't have to worry

372
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,664
- about the future of my career.
- Is that so?

373
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,365
Because I did a little "Ask Jeeves-ing,"

374
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,334
and you, Sir, were recently cut loose

375
00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:49,970
from a high-profile blockbuster.

376
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:52,072
We had artistic differences.

377
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:54,610
You were the artist, and
they were indifferent!

378
00:14:54,922 --> 00:14:56,944
Yes, well, nothing is a
sure thing in this business.

379
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,742
Nothing is a sure thing.

380
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,934
Which is why you should
look at every opportunity

381
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:03,079
as a pearl in an un-shucked oyster.

382
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:06,297
I would hardly call this an opportunity!

383
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:08,955
I-I worked in soaps.

384
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:10,914
They had me play my own father,

385
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:13,907
who then became pregnant
despite the vasectomy.

386
00:15:14,368 --> 00:15:16,359
I still hold the record
for the longest-running

387
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:18,621
demonic possession
on daytime television.

388
00:15:18,656 --> 00:15:19,856
Okay, what's your point?

389
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:21,516
We were number one.

390
00:15:21,993 --> 00:15:24,194
Every project has potential.

391
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:26,096
If you allow yourself to see it,

392
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:27,998
and give it the respect it deserves,

393
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:30,133
others just may follow suit.

394
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,883
Yeah, I really wouldn't know
where to start with this one.

395
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:38,180
Hmm, well, here are my revisions.

396
00:15:38,883 --> 00:15:40,343
If you care to discuss them,

397
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,545
I'll be running lines in the nest.

398
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,949
(Blaire sighs heavily)

399
00:15:46,974 --> 00:15:48,974
Hey Stevie, don't mind me.

400
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:52,333
Just coming in for a
quick cup of rocket fuel.

401
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:55,302
Nobody drinks that
rocket fuel, Mr. Rose.

402
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:57,136
I know it tastes like something I found

403
00:15:57,161 --> 00:15:59,261
in that gutter out there, but uh...

404
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:02,231
it's the pick-me-up I need to
finish reorganizing the shed.

405
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:03,799
(Exasperated sigh)

406
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:07,952
You're reorganizing the shed?

407
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:10,411
That's not on the
calendar 'til next week.

408
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:12,674
Yeah well, with my evenings free,

409
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:14,043
I mean, normally at this time

410
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,313
Moira and I are deciding
on dinner plans, but uh...

411
00:16:17,348 --> 00:16:18,580
Okay, Mr. Rose,

412
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:21,834
I know I might be overstepping here,

413
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:24,853
but I... just wanted you to know

414
00:16:24,888 --> 00:16:27,077
that it's okay to miss your wife.

415
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,697
No, it's just an adjustment, that's all.

416
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:34,329
I mean, we're making
adjustments all the time.

417
00:16:34,364 --> 00:16:37,468
Yesterday I couldn't drink
this coffee, and now...

418
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:45,280
we've been serving this
to guests the whole time?

419
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:46,609
Mr. Rose,

420
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:49,511
I-I hope that someday I find someone

421
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:51,379
who I can stand long enough

422
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:54,101
to feel a little lost
when they're not around.

423
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,214
(Sighs heavily)

424
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,008
I'm exhausted.

425
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,154
Eight days, Stevie.

426
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:07,452
That's the longest we've gone
without seeing each other.

427
00:17:08,731 --> 00:17:09,964
No matter where we were,

428
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:13,066
and... yeah, we've managed to keep it up

429
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:15,866
for almost 40 years.

430
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:18,023
Well, see?

431
00:17:18,841 --> 00:17:21,074
It makes sense that you're a little

432
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,116
out of sorts without her.

433
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:25,123
I'll tell you what's
not out of sorts anymore,

434
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:27,214
that shed! (Chuckles)

435
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:29,917
Yeah well, now that
you're done with the shed,

436
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:34,515
maybe you could start sharing
the jobs with Roland again?

437
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:38,135
Yeah well, you're right, Stevie,

438
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,249
and I will call Roland.

439
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:43,607
It's just I'm so tired

440
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:45,165
From all the work I've been doing,

441
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,702
so I'm thinking...

442
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:48,868
maybe you could...

443
00:17:48,904 --> 00:17:51,155
No, it's just not my job.

444
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:54,841
Right.

445
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:57,450
Patrick: You can do this, David!

446
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:59,446
Just one step at a time!

447
00:17:59,471 --> 00:18:01,338
You're looking pretty
shaky there, David.

448
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:04,202
I really hope we didn't
"rope" you into something here.

449
00:18:04,554 --> 00:18:06,797
Alexis: Hey David, just
pretend you're in like,

450
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:09,088
a super dangerous
walk-and-turn sobriety test.

451
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:10,489
Okay, I don't like this!

452
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:11,891
Okay well then, just turn around!

453
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:14,093
Why would he agree do this
when he's afraid of heights?

454
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:15,428
He's not afraid of heights,

455
00:18:15,463 --> 00:18:16,807
He's afraid of moths and butterflies.

456
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:18,230
And businesswomen in sneakers.

457
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:19,699
Okay, I can hear you!

458
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:21,100
And also heights,

459
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:23,180
something to do with him being
broken up with while he was...

460
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:25,335
Parasailing in the Seychelles!

461
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:28,085
He and Anderson Cooper were
stuck up there for like,

462
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:29,841
three hours, until the wind died down.

463
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:32,343
I totally forgot! Argh!

464
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,523
- I'm sorry, David!
- Aah!

465
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,915
I'm sorry, you were
right, the quiz was rigged.

466
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:40,185
- What?!
- What quiz?

467
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,788
Okay, David took this relationship quiz,

468
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,823
and it said that his
relationship was like,

469
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,524
in need of some excitement.

470
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,304
- What?!
- David, I lied!

471
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,429
I took the quiz like, 15 times.

472
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:52,742
"In Need of a Generator" is like,

473
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:53,932
the only answer you can get.

474
00:18:53,968 --> 00:18:55,433
Oh my God!

475
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,813
Okay, I don't know what this is about,

476
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:58,870
but this generator is running smoothly.

477
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:01,206
So we're doing all of
this so that you can prove

478
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,740
our relationship is exciting?

479
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,141
I failed the stupid quiz,

480
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,477
and Alexis made me feel bad about it.

481
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,957
David, you're basically 40 years old,

482
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,581
I shouldn't be able to make
you feel bad about anything.

483
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,049
I love our relationship.

484
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:13,951
I love it when you order me pizza.

485
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,353
I love when you use
words like inventory!

486
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,866
I even love those stupid rubber things

487
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,356
you put on your fingers,

488
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,558
'cause you think they
flip the pages faster.

489
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,494
They don't flip the pages faster.

490
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,295
They don't flip the pages faster!

491
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,765
- Okay...
- I'm so sorry!

492
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,412
We're gonna talk about
the fact that we missed

493
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,369
half a day of work to make this happen,

494
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:35,539
But you did just do a tree
walk 30 feet in the air for us.

495
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,608
- Yes, I did.
- Both: Muah!

496
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,443
- (Tired exhale)
- All right, guys,

497
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,978
that's one rope down,
seven courses to go.

498
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,014
- Hey.
- Don't touch me.

499
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,649
No.

500
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,380
***

501
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,775
Soon we will walk once more
walk amongst the humans.

502
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:58,778
But until that day
comes, we must remember,

503
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:01,514
the crows don't just have eyes...

504
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:04,593
we also have wings!

505
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:07,698
Caaaaw! Awk! Caw! Caw!

506
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:09,155
- Cut! Cut.
- (Buzzer sounds)

507
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:12,933
Let me guess, he didn't
like the rewrites,

508
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,726
I don't know why,

509
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:19,960
or really, even how,

510
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:23,286
but something about this actually works.

511
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:27,907
Oh. All right then, then um...

512
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:31,177
might I ask why did
we interrupt that take?

513
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:32,422
Right, so at this point Moira,

514
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:34,213
I'm gonna have a bunch of digital birds

515
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:35,948
sort of circling around you,

516
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,884
so if you can just be aware of them.

517
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,853
Yes. Aye, Captain. Note taken.

518
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,221
Let's pick it up from there.

519
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:43,890
In terms of my eye-line,

520
00:20:43,925 --> 00:20:45,999
how many birds am I clocking?

521
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:49,116
And of them, how many are mutants?

522
00:20:50,023 --> 00:20:51,329
Okay, winging it.

523
00:20:51,354 --> 00:20:53,087
Action!

524
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:57,069
(Gravelly and shrill)
Listen to me... aaawk!

525
00:20:57,094 --> 00:21:01,507
The day will come when we
are no longer social outcasts!

526
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:05,703
I am but a tail-feather
away from finding the cure.

527
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:08,593
So please...

528
00:21:09,816 --> 00:21:11,449
quiet your caws

529
00:21:11,484 --> 00:21:14,151
so that we may take up our cause...

530
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:15,887
redemption!

531
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:17,622
Redemption!

532
00:21:17,657 --> 00:21:20,593
Awk! Awk! Ahaaa!

533
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:25,617

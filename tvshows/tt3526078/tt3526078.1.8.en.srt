1
00:00:07,869 --> 00:00:10,637
Mom, can you come here, please?

2
00:00:10,672 --> 00:00:12,339
What?!

3
00:00:12,373 --> 00:00:14,174
- I said, come here, please!
- You come here!

4
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,309
We got a big box sent to us!

5
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:17,644
- We did?
- It's a package!

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,146
- Who's it from?
- I don't know.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,115
Oh! It's for me!

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,419
Thinking of you!

9
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:27,988
"Dear M., hope this helps,

10
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:31,558
I only wish I could do more, xoxo, J.S.P."

11
00:00:31,592 --> 00:00:34,327
Justine St. Pierre!

12
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:37,698
David, one of my dear friends
is finally reaching out,

13
00:00:37,732 --> 00:00:40,500
and you know what, I
knew it would be Justine.

14
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:45,038
She can be an angry drunk,
but we were always close.

15
00:00:45,073 --> 00:00:47,574
"Congratulations on your
Allez Vous Starter Kit."

16
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:48,809
That frigid whore!

17
00:00:48,843 --> 00:00:50,510
What's Allez Vous?

18
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:54,014
It's a scam, it's her
stupid cosmetics company!

19
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:56,183
It's a pyramid scheme
for desperate housewives,

20
00:00:56,217 --> 00:00:57,951
and struggling actors!

21
00:00:57,985 --> 00:00:59,586
Well, how much can we make from this?

22
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,855
David, it's an insult,
we're sending it back!

23
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:03,457
Well, apparently you can win an Audi.

24
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:04,858
What colour?

25
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:07,260
A Champagne Audi, look at that!

26
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:11,064
As if you could ever sell
enough of this crap to get a car.

27
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:13,233
Well, Kristi Stubbs and
her team out of Montreal

28
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:15,368
have sold enough to get the car, so...

29
00:01:15,403 --> 00:01:17,704
don't believe everything
you read, dear, please.

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,907
- Burn it!
- Except this mascara.

31
00:01:20,942 --> 00:01:26,079
- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe -
- www.addic7ed.com -

32
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,118
So Ray can't lend me his car today,

33
00:01:31,152 --> 00:01:34,855
because he has to drive his
92-year-old mother somewhere.

34
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:37,657
Where does a 92-year-old
woman need to go?!

35
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:40,060
I don't know, John, perhaps the hospital?

36
00:01:40,094 --> 00:01:42,195
Yeah, well, it's just I needed that car

37
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,030
to get to my appointment today.

38
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:45,665
What appointment?

39
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,135
Well, you know, the uh...

40
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:50,303
Thing that I had, I had a thing that I...

41
00:01:50,338 --> 00:01:52,973
What thing?

42
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:55,375
An unemployment thing, okay?

43
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,077
To get unemployment insurance,

44
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:58,645
I have the meeting this afternoon,

45
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:01,681
and now I have to grovel to Roland,

46
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:04,718
to get his truck, in
order to get to Elmdale,

47
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:06,186
to get this money...

48
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,688
Well, I think you're brave,

49
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:11,758
and while I didn't see us
living off of food stamps,

50
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:15,362
I think there is something
very masculine about the way

51
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:17,531
you're taking control of this situation.

52
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:19,933
Sweetheart, I'm about to beg for a truck,

53
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:22,269
in order to beg for money,

54
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:23,804
I think you've gotta
raise that masculinity bar

55
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:26,873
just... just a little.

56
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:35,015
- Roland!
- Hey, Johnny.

57
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:37,017
- Hi!
- What?

58
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:38,785
- Hi!
- Can't hear you.

59
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,687
Hey, turn the motor off!

60
00:02:40,721 --> 00:02:42,255
I can't hear you, the motor's on!

61
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,158
Turn the motor off!

62
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:48,728
Turn the motor off, you dumb son of a...

63
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:52,432
well, what can I do for
you, you "dumb son of a... "?

64
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:58,238
Hey Roland, I need... I
need to borrow your truck,

65
00:02:58,272 --> 00:03:00,440
I've got a very important
appointment today,

66
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:03,610
and I sure could use it.

67
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:06,046
Well of course, Johnny, you
know my truck is your truck,

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,948
any time you wanna borrow it,
it's fine with me, no problem-

69
00:03:07,982 --> 00:03:09,742
well, that's very, very
nice, that's so nice.

70
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,652
Listen, as the owner of the truck,

71
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:14,187
would you do me one favour, though?

72
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:16,223
When you return it, can
you bring the seats back up,

73
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:17,591
the way I had 'em, I'd appreciate that.

74
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:18,758
- I do.
- Well, you don't.

75
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:19,893
But if could, I'd appreciate
it, that'd be great.

76
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:21,628
Well, I think I do!

77
00:03:21,662 --> 00:03:23,496
- Here's the keys,
- Thank you.

78
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:25,131
... and also, when you return it,

79
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,100
if you don't mind just backing it in,

80
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:28,368
because in the morning,
I have to kinda crick...

81
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:30,737
Yeah, I'll back it in, I'll back it in!

82
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:32,005
My neck like that, if you could
back it in that would be terrific.

83
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,740
Sure, I'll back it in.

84
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:35,942
The wiper fluid, um...

85
00:03:35,977 --> 00:03:39,079
I had to replace sooner than usual,

86
00:03:39,113 --> 00:03:41,314
- Now, I'm not asking...
- I don't touch the wiper fluid!

87
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:43,049
- Well, okay, somebody did.
- I never use it.

88
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:45,552
Yeah well, I guess your "imaginary
friend" uses wiper fluid, right?

89
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:47,387
I don't know! I'm not
asking for payback here,

90
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:48,755
but whatever you think
is fair would be terrific.

91
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:50,390
Okay, I never use it, though.

92
00:03:50,424 --> 00:03:52,359
The radio was at a four.
I like it at a ten, so...

93
00:03:52,393 --> 00:03:54,661
Okay, you know what, I'm gonna walk!

94
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:56,129
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna walk, Roland!

95
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:57,297
- What do you mean you're walking?
- I don't want your truck!

96
00:03:57,331 --> 00:03:57,898
No, no, the truck's right
there, what are you talking...

97
00:03:57,932 --> 00:03:58,798
I don't need your truck!

98
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,967
It's gonna be there all day!

99
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:01,902
I'm just asking, maybe
you could put a little air

100
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:03,570
in the tires, from time to time.

101
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:05,805
Bonjour!

102
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,141
Now that you've opened
your Allez Vous starter kit,

103
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:10,644
let's begin with those
essential tips and tricks

104
00:04:10,678 --> 00:04:14,047
you'll need to make up
to 600,000 dollars a year.

105
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,082
That's 50,000 a month,

106
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:19,019
that's 7,000 dollars a week.

107
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:22,455
No, it isn't! She didn't
finish high school.

108
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,591
Now, you've heard of other
get rich quick schemes,

109
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,494
but this isn't a scheme, it's a system.

110
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:32,265
Look at the work she's
had done, it's grotesque.

111
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,533
Go grab a pen and paper,

112
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,402
because I'm about to share
with you some essential

113
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:39,039
tips and tricks to maximize
your sales productivity.

114
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:40,974
If this seems like a dream come true,

115
00:04:41,008 --> 00:04:45,145
you need to pay attention
to my tips and tricks.

116
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,813
But the best part is, the
products sell themselves!

117
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:48,315
Okay, where are the tips and tricks?

118
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:49,049
We've been watching this for five minutes,

119
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,417
she's talking in circles!

120
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:52,953
Because it's a scam!

121
00:04:52,987 --> 00:04:53,954
But if your father's
willing to go out there

122
00:04:53,988 --> 00:04:55,689
and sell his soul, dear,

123
00:04:55,723 --> 00:04:59,292
the least we can do is
try to sell this garbage.

124
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:00,827
What's this? Huh?

125
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:03,797
Oh, it's a sunless bronzing.

126
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:05,799
Okay, let's sell it, how hard could it be?

127
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,200
You sell you.

128
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:10,704
You sell you using Allez Vous.

129
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:12,439
Okay, we're going to have a luncheon.

130
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:14,174
A luncheon?

131
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,043
Mm-hmm, a luncheon for
our little townie friends.

132
00:05:17,078 --> 00:05:21,047
It's the least we could do. Hmm!

133
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:23,316
System, support, tips, tricks,
community, opportunity, tips...

134
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:25,418
Twyla?

135
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:27,253
- Hey, what's up?
- Nothing.

136
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:31,024
So um, Ted ordered toast, not home fries,

137
00:05:31,058 --> 00:05:32,759
and he got home fries, so would
you just be a peach, and...

138
00:05:32,793 --> 00:05:34,427
Oh, sorry.

139
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:36,329
No, you know what? It's
okay. I'm good with it.

140
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:39,632
I like home fries, I'm gonna eat 'em, so.

141
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:43,703
First day of a cleanse,
so she's a little whoo!

142
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:46,006
Okay, so I can take it back.

143
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,440
- That would actually be great, if you wouldn't...
- No, no thank you.

144
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:50,010
Lex, if you'll just let
me eat my breakfast here,

145
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:50,910
it's not like there's broken glass in it.

146
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:52,445
There's broken glass?

147
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,514
No, there is not broken glass in it,

148
00:05:54,548 --> 00:05:57,384
just a lot of great flavours
that I can't wait to taste.

149
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:58,752
Great!

150
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:03,423
Thank you.

151
00:06:03,457 --> 00:06:05,258
I'm just trying to help you.

152
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:09,295
Well, if you wanna help, eat something.

153
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,598
I do not like what this
cleanse is doing to your brain.

154
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:14,267
You're being very rude!

155
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:15,602
I'm sorry for yelling.

156
00:06:26,947 --> 00:06:28,615
Ain't she a beaut?

157
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:29,783
Boy, is she ever, Bob.

158
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:32,085
You know, I uh...

159
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,787
I woke up this morning, I said to myself,

160
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:35,989
Johnny, you've gotta buy yourself a car.

161
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:38,258
You may have a business
meeting in Elmdale one day,

162
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:40,193
and you're gonna be in trouble.

163
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:42,162
Yeah, I wouldn't have thought
this was your cup of tea.

164
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:45,965
Oh, this is exactly what I was looking for!

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,636
Yeah, I'd love to take this
baby out for a test drive.

166
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,505
Yeah? I've got the keys,
let's take 'er for a spin.

167
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,541
Not with you, Bob, I
don't wanna bother you.

168
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:57,343
It's no bother.

169
00:06:57,378 --> 00:06:59,813
I would just love to
take this out myself, Bob,

170
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:02,082
you know, a little peccadillo
of mine when I'm buying a car,

171
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:04,617
I like to experience the car one on one,

172
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:06,219
just me and the machine,

173
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:07,420
you know what I mean?

174
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:10,056
No, I don't.

175
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:11,458
I just wanna take it out
for a test drive, Bob,

176
00:07:11,492 --> 00:07:13,159
just for a spin.

177
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:15,128
So... Once around the block?

178
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:16,663
Oh yeah, once around the block,

179
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:17,797
you know, maybe around the corner,

180
00:07:17,832 --> 00:07:18,965
up the road a bit.

181
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:20,633
What road?

182
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:22,635
Well, this road, I'll take it up this road.

183
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,604
Okay, but no lefts, okay?

184
00:07:24,638 --> 00:07:26,506
Because they lead to the highway,

185
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,777
and I really don't want her on the highway.

186
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:34,280
Why would I take it on the highway?

187
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:37,951
♪ driving down that highway of life ♪

188
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:41,020
♪ feelin' fine and feelin' sunny ♪

189
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,590
♪ going to pick me up some money ♪

190
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:48,294
You do know that just staring at the fence

191
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:49,963
isn't gonna help me fix it, right?

192
00:07:49,997 --> 00:07:52,799
Yeah, I am.

193
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,001
I'm just thinking about
Ted, and how nice he is,

194
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:57,003
and... generous,

195
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:59,072
like, almost too generous.

196
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:01,508
And I just wanna grab him
by the sweater sometime,

197
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:04,544
and be like, "stop being
so generous and nice!"

198
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:06,546
He always has been.

199
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,647
I feel bad thinking about all those times

200
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:09,983
I pinned him against a locker.

201
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:13,520
You pinned somebody against a locker?!

202
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:16,156
Well, I was a different person then,

203
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,992
a lot changed since after high school.

204
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:21,895
So what did he do to make
you such a teenage cliché?

205
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:23,696
He always said hi when
he passed me in the halls,

206
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:25,732
and for some reason, it bugged me.

207
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,734
Yeah, I can see that.

208
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:29,802
So he's bugging you.

209
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:31,271
What? No! Oh my God, no!

210
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:33,173
Oh yes.

211
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:35,775
No, I'm just saying, generally speaking,

212
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,378
when you order breakfast and
they give you the wrong order,

213
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:41,047
send it back and get the right order.

214
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:43,616
I never return food,
I think that's so rude.

215
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:53,092
Oh no!

216
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:55,995
Oh, son of a bum!

217
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,431
Son of a bitch!

218
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:05,905
Argh! What the hell?!

219
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,807
Ugh!

220
00:09:09,577 --> 00:09:11,678
Oh!

221
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:14,514
Oh!

222
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:28,027
Well, the good news is all
you need is a new fan belt,

223
00:09:28,062 --> 00:09:29,028
and then you'll be right back on the road.

224
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:30,964
Good, good.

225
00:09:30,998 --> 00:09:33,266
Well, it was important I
get to Elmdale today, Roland,

226
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,435
I appreciate you helping me out.

227
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:37,237
Ah, it's no problem, Johnny.

228
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:40,974
So, where in Elmdale am I taking you?

229
00:09:41,008 --> 00:09:45,211
Oh, just the general
downtown area will be fine.

230
00:09:45,246 --> 00:09:48,615
Okay, don't wanna tell me
where we're going, interesting.

231
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:50,817
It's uh, just... just a business meeting,

232
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,051
just I've gotta meet a guy.

233
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:53,953
Uh huh, what guy?

234
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:56,322
A financial guy, it's a financial matter.

235
00:09:56,357 --> 00:09:57,824
Well Johnny, it's gonna
be awfully hard for me

236
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:59,659
to get you to this meeting if
I don't know where we're going!

237
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:02,095
I mean, why is this such a big secret?

238
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:04,264
It's not a big secret, it's
not a big secret, Roland,

239
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:06,199
and you're only doing 25, if
we could pick it up a little...

240
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:07,800
Oh my God, now you're in such a hurry.

241
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:09,602
What's the big rush here?
I don't get that, either!

242
00:10:09,637 --> 00:10:11,104
The office closes at
four o'clock, that's all.

243
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:12,739
What office are you talking about?

244
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:13,606
The financial guy that
I'm seeing, his office...

245
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:15,141
What financial guy?

246
00:10:15,175 --> 00:10:17,377
The guy I'm doing business
with, I told you...

247
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:18,945
- Where are we going?!
- The unemployment office!

248
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:21,114
Okay?

249
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:25,385
I'm applying for unemployment.

250
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:27,287
Jeez pal, your business is your business.

251
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:28,354
I don't know why you're telling me!

252
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:35,181
Well, good afternoon!

253
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,655
Everyone have a full glass, I hope?

254
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:39,557
We've wanted to have you all here for ages,

255
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:41,292
you've all so graciously welcomed us

256
00:10:41,326 --> 00:10:44,495
into your heavenly hamlet!

257
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:47,898
Now, if you'll be so good as to follow me,

258
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:49,333
David is setting out some hors d'oeuvres

259
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:51,836
in our adjoining suite.

260
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,139
David! We have guests!

261
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:57,107
You were supposed to have cleaned
up all these quality products!

262
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:59,810
I must've lost track of time.

263
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:02,947
Now the seating areas are
covered in Allez Vous cosmetics!

264
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:05,482
I know, I just didn't want
to put such high quality

265
00:11:05,517 --> 00:11:08,853
paraben and paba free product on the floor!

266
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:13,157
Come on in.

267
00:11:13,191 --> 00:11:15,693
Okay, well everything's going
super well, I can see, so...

268
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:17,494
well no, come on, we've
gotta stay for a bit.

269
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:19,530
No, we've made our
appearance, and now we can go.

270
00:11:19,564 --> 00:11:21,932
Your mom asked me to come.

271
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:23,968
Well, she asked everybody to come.

272
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:25,769
Can you not just say no for one time, Ted?!

273
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,809
Jocelyn, you can hold this lip plumper.

274
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:33,878
Ronnie, this is a mineral moisturizer,

275
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:36,213
you could keep it on
your lap, or sample it.

276
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:38,716
David, now is not the
time to discuss Allez Vous'

277
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,618
preferred customer discounts.

278
00:11:40,652 --> 00:11:43,320
Oh!

279
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:45,055
Actually, I think I'm going
to be getting lunch elsewhere.

280
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,457
Can I come with you?

281
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:48,058
I don't think so.

282
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:51,695
Now you get all decisive-y?

283
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,131
I was just so excited
about Allez Vous' exclusive

284
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:57,735
anti-aging formula,
and rejuvenation serums.

285
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:59,637
Alexis, you'd like this product.

286
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:01,839
It's all about aging, and dry skin.

287
00:12:01,873 --> 00:12:04,341
Oh my God, ew, David!

288
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:06,477
David, I know you're excited to be part

289
00:12:06,511 --> 00:12:08,812
of the fastest growing
multilevel marketing community

290
00:12:08,847 --> 00:12:12,750
on the continent, but honestly!

291
00:12:12,784 --> 00:12:14,184
There's something wrong with your face.

292
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:16,787
With my face?

293
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,756
Well, if any of you do
happen to have questions

294
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,991
about the products,

295
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:24,795
or how to make up to
600,000 dollars a year,

296
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:28,198
I suppose I'd be willing to
share with you what I know.

297
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:37,441
In the meantime, please, eat, drink,

298
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:40,311
to your possible beauty!

299
00:12:42,147 --> 00:12:44,114
How can I help you today, sir?

300
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:45,883
Uh, yes, Johnny Rose, I have an
appointment to get some money.

301
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:48,052
Get some money?

302
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:50,888
I need a cheque, preferably today.

303
00:12:50,922 --> 00:12:52,523
Ideally in the next few minutes,

304
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:54,658
'cause I have somebody waiting in the car.

305
00:12:54,693 --> 00:12:58,028
Well, we don't just give out money.

306
00:12:58,063 --> 00:12:59,797
First we need some information.

307
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:01,799
Oh yeah, sure, yeah. Hm-hm.

308
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,702
- Your name?
- Johnny Rose.

309
00:13:04,736 --> 00:13:07,104
- Last employer?
- Johnny Rose.

310
00:13:07,138 --> 00:13:08,439
And how long did you work for yourself?

311
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:11,875
All my life.

312
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,745
And your reason for being out of work?

313
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:18,549
I sold my business, and I got
screwed by my business manager.

314
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,018
Did you pay into unemployment insurance?

315
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:23,754
I don't know, maybe I did, maybe I didn't,

316
00:13:23,788 --> 00:13:27,758
it never came across my desk, I uh...

317
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:32,730
We can't give you money unless
you contributed to the program.

318
00:13:32,764 --> 00:13:34,365
I don't think you're understanding,

319
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,801
I employed people, hundreds of people.

320
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:40,270
You see, and now I'm unemployed.

321
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:42,840
But that doesn't mean you
qualify for unemployment.

322
00:13:42,874 --> 00:13:44,308
I lost my job!

323
00:13:44,342 --> 00:13:46,043
You lost your business.

324
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:48,579
Okay, let me walk you through this.

325
00:13:48,613 --> 00:13:51,749
You see, I need money
to get back on my feet

326
00:13:51,783 --> 00:13:54,451
so I can employ more people,

327
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:56,587
that might actually end up
saving you money in the long run

328
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:58,122
now, am I the only one who understands

329
00:13:58,156 --> 00:13:59,790
how an economy works around here?!

330
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:02,459
Let me walk you through this, Mr. Rose.

331
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:05,295
Unless you can prove that you
contributed, you don't qualify.

332
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,997
If you were laid off, or fired,

333
00:14:07,032 --> 00:14:08,265
or could show that you
were out looking for work,

334
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:09,900
that would be a different story.

335
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,368
I'd like to talk to
your supervisor, please.

336
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:14,271
I am the supervisor.

337
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:17,808
And, may I say, doing a fantastic job.

338
00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:24,948
And who's interested?

339
00:14:24,983 --> 00:14:27,484
Well, it doesn't look like
anybody's really interested.

340
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,486
Get out!

341
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:35,125
I know someone here wants in
on this exclusive opportunity!

342
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,027
Moira, honey, that Champagne
Audi is really hard to get.

343
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:39,730
Excuse me?

344
00:14:39,764 --> 00:14:41,932
Take it from me, Roland and
I have been Allez Vous reps

345
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:45,769
for two years, and we're
still driving that old truck.

346
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:49,406
Sorry, you're... you're
an Allez Vous consultant?

347
00:14:49,441 --> 00:14:52,076
I'm actually an executive area manager.

348
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,445
I'm a district manager.

349
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:56,346
I'm an executive district manager.

350
00:14:56,381 --> 00:14:57,581
I gave up.

351
00:14:57,615 --> 00:14:59,950
What?!

352
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:01,485
The Allez Vous craze hit
the town a couple years ago,

353
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,554
and you should've seen us!

354
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:05,322
In two weeks we had sold everything

355
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:07,224
to the other half of town, and vice versa.

356
00:15:07,258 --> 00:15:09,993
That's... that's funny.

357
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:13,330
It became a bit incestuous,
yeah, very small sales pool.

358
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:16,633
It became literally
impossible to climb the ladder.

359
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:19,636
Anywho, good luck!

360
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:26,944
Somehow, we got off on the wrong foot.

361
00:15:26,978 --> 00:15:30,380
Okay? So if I in any way
gave you the impression that-

362
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:32,416
I am locking up now, Mr. Rose.

363
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,050
Johnny, how long is this gonna take,

364
00:15:33,084 --> 00:15:35,619
'cause I got a couple-

365
00:15:35,653 --> 00:15:37,754
Roland?

366
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:41,592
Well Marnie, hello. How are you?

367
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:43,727
Haven't seen you in a while.

368
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:47,531
Yeah, it has been a while, hasn't it?

369
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:50,467
Marnie and I were, um, how shall I say it?

370
00:15:50,502 --> 00:15:53,403
"Close friends" in high school.

371
00:15:53,438 --> 00:15:54,838
Isn't that right, Marnie?

372
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:56,874
Okay, that's enough of that.

373
00:15:56,908 --> 00:15:58,628
Marnie likes the bad boys.

374
00:15:58,643 --> 00:16:00,911
Roland!

375
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:02,479
Are you taking care of
my bad boy over there?

376
00:16:02,514 --> 00:16:04,081
No, she's being quite obstinate
about this whole situation.

377
00:16:04,115 --> 00:16:06,617
I'm getting nothing!

378
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:08,785
Well, unfortunately,
Mr. Rose doesn't qualify

379
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,722
for unemployment because
he's never had a job.

380
00:16:11,756 --> 00:16:13,157
Oh well, didn't he tell you about the job

381
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:15,626
- he was doing for me?
- No, what job?

382
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,195
You didn't tell her?

383
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:21,632
No-no, not
specifically, I-I-uh...

384
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,300
Well, that's important
information, Mr. Rose.

385
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:25,369
You working for Roland
makes you an employee.

386
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:28,205
- Yes!
- Oh! I forgot.

387
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:30,841
Well, what were your duties?

388
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,277
Well, I was in more of
a consulting position.

389
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:36,146
Oh!  No, no, no, no, no.

390
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:38,415
It was not a consulting
position, he was my assistant,

391
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:39,883
he was like my little guy Friday.

392
00:16:39,918 --> 00:16:41,485
He would fetch things for me,

393
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,287
I'd tell him where to go
and he'd go running off,

394
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:44,988
and fetching things for me.

395
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:46,690
What were some of the things you fetched?

396
00:16:46,724 --> 00:16:49,159
- You fetched like uh...
- Coffee.

397
00:16:49,194 --> 00:16:51,094
- Coffee, you'd get that, and um...
- I get his coffee...

398
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:53,597
- Sometimes you'd have to...
- Get a hankie.

399
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:56,099
- No, you'd pick up, you know...
- Cleaning, his dry cleaning.

400
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:57,334
- Yeah, you'd have to do that, and then...
- Just when he didn't have time.

401
00:16:57,368 --> 00:16:59,102
How about these guys down
there, those are boots.

402
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:00,237
Nothing with the boots,
I don't think there was-

403
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:01,605
Oh, there was something with the boots.

404
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,373
Polish them every once in a while.

405
00:17:03,408 --> 00:17:05,008
Every now and then, he had to do that, too.

406
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:08,011
He was a hell of a worker and
I really, really needed him,

407
00:17:08,046 --> 00:17:12,115
because you know how busy I can get.

408
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,784
Yes I do.

409
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:19,890
Yeah, unfortunately I
had to can his ass though,

410
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:22,593
because of that whole
"cut the gravy" thing, so.

411
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:25,729
Oh. Well...

412
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:28,398
I think we can make this work.

413
00:17:34,973 --> 00:17:37,808
Hey... I come in peace.

414
00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:40,043
What's this?

415
00:17:40,078 --> 00:17:43,665
I don't know, it's a pre shave
follicle mask or something,

416
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:48,151
I took it from the pile of
product that nobody bought.

417
00:17:48,186 --> 00:17:49,920
Sweet gesture.

418
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:55,892
I'm sorry for being rude.

419
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:57,361
You have to understand
that you're the first

420
00:17:57,395 --> 00:17:59,062
nice guy that I've dated.

421
00:17:59,097 --> 00:18:02,132
Lex, I am not always nice.

422
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,766
I just really want my family to like you.

423
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:05,936
They don't like me?

424
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,338
No, they do! They do, they've just
always seen nice as a sign of weakness,

425
00:18:08,373 --> 00:18:10,107
they take advantage of nice.

426
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:13,644
No, nice does not always mean weak, it's...

427
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:17,714
Okay, so get mad, then.

428
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:20,217
Say something super mean.

429
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:24,221
What, I can't just turn it on
in an instant, like you can.

430
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:28,625
Okay well, consider it
a kind of role play then,

431
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,328
and just let it out.

432
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:35,599
I-I don't know...

433
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:38,635
I find your brother can be a
little pretentious sometimes.

434
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,470
Yes, yes!

435
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:42,839
He is so pretentious, and it is so gross.

436
00:18:42,874 --> 00:18:44,174
This is good, keep going.

437
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,710
Well, and your mother...

438
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:49,313
Seems to be a little uninformed at times.

439
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:51,966
She's uninformed most of the time.

440
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:53,376
This is great, this is really good.

441
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:54,952
Keep going!

442
00:18:54,986 --> 00:18:56,653
Well, and you, what about you?

443
00:18:56,688 --> 00:18:57,788
Are you just going to sit around all day,

444
00:18:57,822 --> 00:18:59,123
while I work and buy you dinners?

445
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:01,091
You've gotta go out there and get a job...

446
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:02,526
- Too far.
- Mm-hmm.

447
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,062
- It's too far, okay.
- That's too far.

448
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:07,531
All right, and there we go.

449
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:10,000
- Boy, thank you!
- Oh, stop it.

450
00:19:10,034 --> 00:19:14,438
No, no, Roland, I-I owe you big.

451
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:18,108
Well um, one day, and
that day may never come,

452
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,911
I may call upon you to perform a function.

453
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:22,379
Marlon Brando!

454
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:24,848
Yes, but from what movie?

455
00:19:24,883 --> 00:19:27,284
The Godfather.

456
00:19:27,318 --> 00:19:29,153
No, it's the one where
he's the big mafia guy.

457
00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:31,455
The Godfather!

458
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:33,824
Hold on a second, I'll think of it.

459
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:37,561
Anyway, I appreciate what you've
done, Roland, I really do, I'm-

460
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:39,863
Don't you worry about it,
Johnny, I'm happy to do it.

461
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:42,166
Why don't you just get
me a little wiper fluid,

462
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,834
and we'll call it even, okay?

463
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:45,402
Okay, wiper fluid, you got it.

464
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:46,870
And also maybe a Kleenex caddy?

465
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:48,505
I've always wanted one of those.

466
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,973
That's funny!

467
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:52,142
It is, but I'm not joking.

468
00:19:52,177 --> 00:19:55,479
All right, one Kleenex
caddy, and wiper fluid.

469
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,357
Roland, you screwed it up!

470
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:10,727
Roland!

471
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,630
Roland!

472
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,734
Son of a bitch!

473
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,865
Oh Johnny, I told you not
to take 'er on the highway.

474
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:27,466
Yeah, I'm sorry, Bob,

475
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,669
I guess I took one of those
left turns, and uh, yeah.

476
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:32,905
Okay, well, let's get 'er hooked up,

477
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:35,274
get you back to the garage,

478
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:36,475
and we'll start on the paperwork.

479
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:39,311
What paperwork?

480
00:20:39,345 --> 00:20:42,281
It's all filled in, you just
have to sign it, and uh...

481
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:44,249
She's all yours!

482
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,851
I'm not buying this car!

483
00:20:45,885 --> 00:20:47,619
You change your mind?

484
00:20:47,654 --> 00:20:50,823
It broke, twice! It's a broken car!

485
00:20:50,857 --> 00:20:52,591
We'll play a little hardball, okay.

486
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,227
I'll knock twenty bucks off.

487
00:20:55,261 --> 00:20:56,821
You couldn't get twenty bucks for scrap!

488
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,697
Oh!

489
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:00,566
All right, thirty bucks!

490
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,401
How about zero bucks?!

491
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:03,969
I wouldn't give you a dime for this!

492
00:21:04,003 --> 00:21:05,571
Johnny, you're killing me here!

493
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:07,439
Fifty bucks!

494
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:11,643
Oh, you know what, Bob,
I'm walking. I'm walking!

495
00:21:11,678 --> 00:21:13,479
I'll throw in a couple of floor mats,

496
00:21:13,513 --> 00:21:14,680
but that's my final offer!

497
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:15,380
Walking!

498
00:21:15,382 --> 00:21:22,221
Hey!

499
00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:23,489
I said bring

500
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:24,590
the goddamn diaper bag!

501
00:21:24,592 --> 00:21:25,724
Have you seen that couple

502
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:26,558
that checked in?

503
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,593
They're my cousins.

504
00:21:27,595 --> 00:21:28,427
Oh.

505
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:29,394
John, you're speaking

506
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:30,496
at the funeral?

507
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,864
Nothing says we'll miss you

508
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:32,866
like an excerpt

509
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:33,999
from Breaking Dawn.

510
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:36,023

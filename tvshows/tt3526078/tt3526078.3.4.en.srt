1
00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:01,937
(Birds chirp, car door slams)

2
00:00:01,962 --> 00:00:04,197
Johnny: Well, what do you
think of the new wheels?

3
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:06,390
Do you want my honest opinion?

4
00:00:06,758 --> 00:00:09,025
- Or...
- You got your wallet?

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,773
Um, I have my debit card.

6
00:00:10,798 --> 00:00:12,699
And what about your license?

7
00:00:12,997 --> 00:00:15,703
- What about it?
- Do you have it?

8
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:17,406
It's fine.

9
00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:19,427
It was a yes or no question.

10
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,634
Okay, yes, it's fine.

11
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:24,007
We're going up the street,
I don't need my license.

12
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,053
David, we just insured the car,

13
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:28,912
and you can't drive it unless
you have your license on you,

14
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,881
so could you go get it, please?

15
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,078
(Sighs) It's expired.

16
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,596
- When did your license expire?!
- I don't know!

17
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,304
Like, last month.

18
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:39,122
Then you're not driving!

19
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:41,224
Well, I drove the car yesterday!

20
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:43,360
- Well, that's illegal, David!
- Argh!

21
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:45,662
You need to go renew your license!

22
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:47,107
Alexis: Are you guys done with the car?

23
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,132
No, we're just leaving.

24
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:49,851
Okay, 'cause it looks
like you're getting out.

25
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,879
We're changing seats because
David's license is expired.

26
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:54,471
(Gasps) Oh no!

27
00:00:54,505 --> 00:00:56,573
And it took him like, 16
tries to get it last time.

28
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:58,775
It didn't take me 16 tries!

29
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,944
I failed the written test twice,

30
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,647
and then took the
driving test, and passed!

31
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:05,125
And then your learner's permit expired,

32
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:06,750
and you had to do the
written test again,

33
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:08,685
which you... failed.

34
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,120
Oh, I remember this!

35
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:11,588
You had to start from scratch,

36
00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:14,024
and you failed the
practical two more times.

37
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:16,460
God! Moira: Oh, the poor thing
has crippling test anxiety.

38
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:17,861
We all know that.

39
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:19,729
Who has the keys? I need the car.

40
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:22,375
Well, we're using the
car right now, sweetheart.

41
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:26,593
David, would you drive your
mummy to Town Hall, please?

42
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,539
He can't drive, his license is expired.

43
00:01:29,564 --> 00:01:31,320
Okay, I will drive.

44
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:33,196
You got your wallet?

45
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:34,692
It's fine.

46
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:38,195

(Dog barks in the distance)

51
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,839
- Ugh!
- Oooh!

52
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:04,808
So many boxes.

53
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:06,220
And most of them are
filled with paperwork

54
00:02:06,244 --> 00:02:07,531
I have to go through,

55
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:11,217
so I'm just hoping I contract
some deadly lung infection

56
00:02:11,242 --> 00:02:13,383
from the dust before I
have to open another one.

57
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:14,928
Um well, I wouldn't
really worry about it,

58
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:16,520
I managed several galleries,

59
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:19,125
and never once looked
at the paperwork, so.

60
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:21,424
It either all comes
together, or it doesn't.

61
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:22,734
Ultimately.

62
00:02:22,825 --> 00:02:24,526
Did it ever come together?

63
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:26,919
Um, I think we're getting sidetracked.

64
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:31,476
The upside is that you
are your own boss now!

65
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,104
Or I'm the owner of a very sad business

66
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:36,554
with one under-performing employee.

67
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:39,543
Okay, what I find helpful
when I get overwhelmed

68
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:42,012
is actually taking a step away

69
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:44,614
for like, 15 minutes to an hour,

70
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:46,983
to um, to maybe two hours,

71
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:49,890
and ah, helping... people.

72
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:53,067
I feel like there's a request coming on.

73
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:55,004
Mm, not so much a request,

74
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:56,969
as it is an opportunity.

75
00:02:56,994 --> 00:03:01,007
I am looking for a very lucky person

76
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:04,167
to drive me to my driver's test.

77
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:08,939
Oh yeah, that's not
gonna happen right now.

78
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:12,075
Um, I guess you're right.

79
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,937
I should probably be helping you.

80
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,478
I would love to run some errands,

81
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:17,380
or you know, maybe pick something up,

82
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:21,390
I just-I just need a
valid driver's license.

83
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:29,312
The test is this afternoon.

84
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,382
And I'm very anxious about it.

85
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:34,578
And need a lift.

86
00:03:35,232 --> 00:03:37,334
Um... you know what?

87
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:39,437
I don't think this
is a good time to ask.

88
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:42,377
Hmm, that's really perceptive.

89
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:44,841
Um, I'm gonna find someone
with a little more time...

90
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,910
- on their hands.
- Okay.

91
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:47,921
Okay...

92
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:51,047
I don't know why you
didn't ask me first, David.

93
00:03:51,082 --> 00:03:52,983
I have my license in
seven different countries,

94
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:54,751
And I have my "F" Class.

95
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:56,252
Isn't that for transport trucks?!

96
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:58,622
Yes, well, I had a
lot of people to move!

97
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,023
Anyway, it's not a big deal.

98
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:01,758
You just get in, you
do what they tell you,

99
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:02,828
and then you get out.

100
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:04,186
And wear your best hair perfume.

101
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,763
Okay, I don't have hair perfume,

102
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:08,965
and not all of us can flirt our way

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,367
into getting a driver's license!

104
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:13,370
Okay, you try parallel
parking in a burka, David.

105
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:14,881
No amount of flirting
can get you out of that,

106
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:16,439
trust me!

107
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:18,174
Okay, the big difference is that nothing

108
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,576
seems to give you anxiety,

109
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,411
which is actually sort of concerning.

110
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:22,846
Oh, that reminds me,

111
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,984
can you hold the wheel for a second,

112
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:25,387
I need to check my phone. Oh my God!

113
00:04:25,412 --> 00:04:27,194
I'll tell you what's
not helping me right now!

114
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:29,152
- This!
- Hey, relax, David.

115
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,381
I once had a 7-year-old
drive me around Mumbai,

116
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:33,657
so I'm pretty sure you're
cool to steer for a sec.

117
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,058
- Ugh!
- Okay.

118
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:37,074
Okay!

119
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:39,703
(Sighs nervously)

120
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:42,065
- Breaths!
- (Exhales)

121
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:44,039
- Breaths!
- (Exhales)

122
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:45,969
(Exhales)

123
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:49,906
(Traffic rumbles, birds chirp)

124
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,527
(Door opens)

125
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,489
Oh Stevie, I don't mean to bother you,

126
00:04:55,513 --> 00:04:57,647
but um, there's a leaky faucet

127
00:04:57,682 --> 00:05:00,562
in David and Alexis' bathroom.

128
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:03,406
And this is a pressing issue for you?

129
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:05,732
Well, it's just that when
you're in our bathroom,

130
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:07,691
you can hear it clear as day,

131
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,592
I mean, it's almost
like it's happening...

132
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:11,227
in our bathroom.

133
00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:12,437
But it's not.

134
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:15,665
So I'm just gonna finish this first.

135
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,100
- Hi.
- And...

136
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:19,867
Stevie, I'll need
your telephone, please.

137
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:22,672
- Sure.
- Along with the number for a plumber.

138
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:25,909
The faucet is dripping
in David and Alexis' room.

139
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:27,310
It's exasperating,

140
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:29,257
the incessant tap, tap, tap...

141
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:31,624
Oh, it's so irritating, Stevie, it...

142
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:32,843
(Stevie sobs)

143
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:35,484
But maybe this is uh...

144
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,062
not a good time.

145
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,454
(Sobs loudly)

146
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,591
Oh, boy troubles, no doubt.

147
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,959
We don't want to intrude, dear,

148
00:05:42,993 --> 00:05:44,742
just when you can, plumber, please.

149
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:46,830
Or get someone else to do it, Stevie,

150
00:05:46,864 --> 00:05:49,432
because... you are the owner now.

151
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:50,648
Yeah!

152
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:53,570
And I don't know what I'm doing!

153
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,305
Oh! None of us do, dear!

154
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:58,007
We're all just muddling
through, aren't we?

155
00:05:58,042 --> 00:05:59,542
I mean, look at John.

156
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:00,867
Why look at me?!

157
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:03,113
I'm saying, even someone with a history

158
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:06,316
of wild success can experience
a downtick now and then.

159
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,284
Well, I didn't realize
I had a downtick, Moira.

160
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,753
Just, I don't know what to do,

161
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,021
do I sell the motel?

162
00:06:12,056 --> 00:06:13,523
Sell the motel? No, no!

163
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:17,076
No, no, that's not something
you should be thinking about.

164
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:18,960
- Mmm!
- I mean, I can't keep it!

165
00:06:18,985 --> 00:06:21,965
Okay Stevie, allow me to get you a pill.

166
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:23,967
It's going to make you
forget every last one

167
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:26,903
of those irrational thoughts
for at least two days!

168
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:29,606
Yes, and Stevie, if you
need any help at all,

169
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,851
please, feel free to come by our room.

170
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:33,543
Well, I'll be at work.

171
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:34,911
But John will be there,

172
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:36,379
implementing and strategizing.

173
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:38,648
And honestly, the drip
is just uh, you know,

174
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:42,026
a wish list project,
lowest of priorities.

175
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,354
I'm-I just need a
minute, and I'll do it.

176
00:06:44,388 --> 00:06:46,089
- Sure, yes, of course.
- Oh, Stevie.

177
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:47,590
(French accent) Courage!

178
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,958
(Sobs)

179
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:51,559
(Door slams)

180
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,978
(Groans)

181
00:06:55,846 --> 00:06:56,729
Whoa!

182
00:06:56,754 --> 00:06:59,379
John, you don't really think
she'd sell the place, do you?

183
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:02,315
It would not bode
well for us if she did.

184
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:08,203
(Door slams)

185
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,595
(Car rumbles)

186
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:18,033
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the car

187
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:19,809
for 20 minutes, so that I can
do my transcendental meditation

188
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,224
before I fail this test.

189
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:24,527
Okay, you are acting all
sorts of crazy right now.

190
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:25,929
This honestly does not matter.

191
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:27,497
Nobody cares.

192
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:29,651
Uh, people care.

193
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,503
I care, the driving
examiner person cares.

194
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,004
No, he doesn't.

195
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,106
Trust me, people aren't
thinking about you

196
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:39,127
the way that you're thinking about you.

197
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:41,110
What does that mean?

198
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:42,579
You always over think everything,

199
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:44,518
and that's why you fail all the time.

200
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,249
Thank you, Alexis.

201
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:47,851
Well, it's true!

202
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,653
Okay, just because
everything falls in your lap,

203
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:53,572
doesn't mean it falls
in everyone else's.

204
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:54,885
What does?!

205
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:57,627
- What?
- What falls in my lap?

206
00:07:57,661 --> 00:08:00,541
Stuff! Things. Opportunities.

207
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,398
Things don't fall in my lap!

208
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:03,800
Okay, I'm just saying,

209
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:05,768
that you've always just gotten stuff,

210
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:08,805
without realizing that other
people don't skate through life

211
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,206
the same way you do.

212
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:12,208
I don't skate through life David,

213
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:13,886
I walk through life.

214
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,278
In really nice shoes.

215
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:17,547
And I'm sorry if that
rubs you the wrong way,

216
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,259
but maybe if you could
just relax for a second,

217
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:21,317
and stop worrying about everything,

218
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:23,213
everything would be easier for you!

219
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:25,212
And what I'm saying
is that things haven't

220
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:27,257
been as easy for me as
they've been for you!

221
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,393
Um, yes, they have!

222
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,309
No, they haven't!

223
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:33,029
And now I'm even more stressed out

224
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:35,432
than when I got in the stupid car!

225
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,651
Thank you very much
for your help, Alexis.

226
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:40,422
Hey!

227
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:42,639
I'm the one that's
supposed to be getting out

228
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:44,841
of the stupid car, David!

229
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,627
The driving man's coming!

230
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:48,612
Oh my God!

231
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,187
David?

232
00:08:58,222 --> 00:08:59,789
Nobody cares.

233
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:01,291
- I got it!
- Okay!

234
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:04,772
(Sighs)

235
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:12,683
(Birds chirp)

236
00:09:15,744 --> 00:09:17,018
Johnny: Hey, Stevie.

237
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,424
Good news,

238
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:22,312
I fixed the drip in David
and Alexis' bathroom,

239
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:24,963
so you can check that off your list.

240
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:26,642
Thank you.

241
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,919
You know, to be honest
it's more a temporary fix,

242
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:32,388
I put a sandwich bag over the faucet,

243
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:34,557
and secured it with...

244
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:36,322
an elastic.

245
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:39,649
Oh okay, won't the drips...

246
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:41,899
fill up the sandwich bag?

247
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,934
Well, like I said, it's temporary,

248
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:47,744
uh, but it might buy you a little time.

249
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,931
A little.

250
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:53,588
Ooh! A ledger?

251
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:58,292
I haven't seen one of these in a while.

252
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,204
Aha, well, at first glance,

253
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:04,053
what you think of say,

254
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:06,964
charging for late check outs?

255
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:08,725
Yeah, again, that would assume

256
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,104
that we had guests to check out.

257
00:10:11,786 --> 00:10:13,796
Well, there's a solution
to everything, Stevie,

258
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:15,298
and when that idea comes,

259
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:16,866
it's going to appear...

260
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,104
so obvious.

261
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:20,230
Well, I mean, I did
think that I could start

262
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:23,979
charging full price to
the long term guests here.

263
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:27,877
And sometimes it's the
second or third idea

264
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:30,190
that's really the keeper.

265
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:33,449
- Hey.
- Afternoon.

266
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:34,817
(Door slams)

267
00:10:38,198 --> 00:10:40,490
Oh, Moira's in early.

268
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:42,759
Oh, just catching up on my reading.

269
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:45,328
Well, we'll leave you to it.

270
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:49,727
Oh dear, that's a shame.

271
00:10:49,752 --> 00:10:51,589
(Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk)

272
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:56,072
That's a real shame!

273
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:59,948
The old pulp mill in Elmdale, torn down.

274
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,455
That reminds me, I gotta
check out the new pulp mill.

275
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,913
I hear it's breathtaking.

276
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:06,082
But surely the old
pulp mill had its charm,

277
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:08,184
and it was an historic landmark.

278
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:09,685
Where'd you find that article?!

279
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,889
The old pulp mill closed
down what, two years ago?

280
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,253
Well, it just makes one think,

281
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:18,261
might there be a building
struggling in our town

282
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,030
that could, with the
aid of municipal funds,

283
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:23,190
avoid befalling a similar fate?

284
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:25,107
Like the library.

285
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:27,336
Gwen does all her internet stuff there,

286
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:30,740
you know, she worries about
people tracing her IP address.

287
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,910
I was thinking of
another worthy landmark,

288
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:35,315
the motel.

289
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:39,115
Oh, that sounds like
more of a personal issue.

290
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:41,472
Oh, it's very personal, for Stevie.

291
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,319
The poor thing is a wreck.

292
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:46,136
Inheriting the motel,
feeling lost and alone.

293
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:48,690
She even threatened to sell the place!

294
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:51,260
A pitiable creature, that's what she is.

295
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:54,130
John and I, we both
threw our arms around her,

296
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:55,498
figuratively speaking,

297
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:57,500
and we said, the people of this town,

298
00:11:57,534 --> 00:11:59,769
and Council in particular,

299
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,705
will not let this
business go under, Stevie.

300
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:04,526
For your sake, Stevie!

301
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:07,877
I thought you were
against giving town funds

302
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:09,879
to heritage projects.

303
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:12,582
Yeah, when we wanted to
restore the war memorial,

304
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:15,464
you said we should avoid taking sides.

305
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:18,960
But this cause affects everyone.

306
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:20,823
We all know, or are,

307
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:23,147
people who live in the motel.

308
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:28,264
In closing, I move that
we free up heritage funds

309
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:29,799
for the motel, effective immediately,

310
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,362
all in favor, say Aye.

311
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:36,336
Ronnie, you're with me?

312
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:38,089
I see that you're scratching.

313
00:12:38,114 --> 00:12:39,615
Bob! You're making a note!

314
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:42,445
Oh, just writing uh,
"visit new pulp mill."

315
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:44,080
Yeah, Roland got me thinking.

316
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:45,515
I hear the floors are so clean,

317
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:47,081
you can eat your lunch off them.

318
00:12:47,251 --> 00:12:49,085
I laid those floors.

319
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,473
(Phone buttons click)

320
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:03,481
Okay, Derek.

321
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:05,850
You are gonna make a turn up ahead.

322
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:07,565
Uh, it's David.

323
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,821
Oh yep, sorry about that.

324
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:12,634
Um, I just didn't want
you thinking you had gotten

325
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,245
in the wrong car.

326
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:16,152
- Rose, David?
- Yes.

327
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:19,564
Sorry, it's been a long day.

328
00:13:20,628 --> 00:13:22,462
Um, so a left or a right?

329
00:13:23,898 --> 00:13:25,265
What?

330
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:27,220
You said there's a turn coming up,

331
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:29,536
do you want a left
turn, or a right turn?

332
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:31,484
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a left.

333
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:33,644
- Okay.
- But when I tell you to make a left.

334
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:37,813
Okay. Um, can I ask you a question?

335
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,260
Uh yep, failure to
signal will be counted.

336
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:44,253
Um, how old are you?

337
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:46,869
- Twenty-eight.
- Mhmm, and is this like,

338
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:49,034
what you would like to do for a career?

339
00:13:49,308 --> 00:13:52,104
Well, I uh, I DJ on the weekends.

340
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,506
- Ah.
- Why?

341
00:13:55,308 --> 00:13:57,843
So you don't really care about this.

342
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,178
Like, about me, in the car.

343
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:00,915
I mean, you care in the
sense that it's your job,

344
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,300
but you don't-you don't
care about this, do you?

345
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:07,419
I've done like, eight of these today.

346
00:14:07,454 --> 00:14:08,995
Is that a problem?

347
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,027
No.

348
00:14:13,627 --> 00:14:15,261
(Birds chirp)

349
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,917
(Key rattles in lock)

350
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,743
(Adding machine whirs)

351
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,371
Oh, there she is, back from council.

352
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:26,772
Any chance of a bailout?

353
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:28,941
I was very persuasive.

354
00:14:28,975 --> 00:14:30,809
And there were lots of questions,

355
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:32,444
that shows engagement.

356
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:35,314
Good, 'cause even with
just a little cash flow,

357
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,983
I think Stevie can get
this motel back on its feet.

358
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:40,052
- Excellent.
- Yes.

359
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:41,853
And if she can get let's say,

360
00:14:41,878 --> 00:14:43,845
a volume discount on paper products,

361
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,025
or offer deals on last
minute bookings, then...

362
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,327
Well, it sounds to me
like we may not even need

363
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:50,429
those funds from Council.

364
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:52,198
Oh, no, no, we need the funds,

365
00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:53,899
that's for sure, but I'm just saying,

366
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,868
if she took some of my suggestions...

367
00:14:55,902 --> 00:14:57,175
Stop!

368
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:59,872
I want to remember this moment.

369
00:14:59,906 --> 00:15:01,183
What moment?

370
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,885
I haven't seen you this
excited in a very long time.

371
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,744
No, I'm just thinking of Stevie,

372
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,306
and... listen,

373
00:15:07,331 --> 00:15:09,220
how much money do you think
we can get from council?

374
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:12,392
Well, now I'm wondering if that money

375
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:14,320
might not just complicate things.

376
00:15:14,354 --> 00:15:17,389
Look how much you've achieved
with your back to the wall.

377
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:19,447
Necessity drives invention,

378
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:22,548
and far be it from me to
rob you of your necessity!

379
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,997
Well, I'm not thinking of
getting that involved, Moira,

380
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:27,399
I'm just offering a bit of advice.

381
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:29,268
You've been looking for a project, John.

382
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:31,971
Well, not running a motel,
Moira, that's a commitment

383
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:33,947
Or not! Go!

384
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:35,507
Go tell Stevie of your decision.

385
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:36,351
What decision?

386
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:38,997
And I'll instruct Council
to save their largesse

387
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,123
for a more worthy charity.

388
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:43,749
You didn't get the money, did you?

389
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:45,351
Go, John!

390
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,779
Before the passion dies again!

391
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:51,690
(Door slams)

392
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:55,894
(Car rumbles)

393
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,208
So I assume you got your license,

394
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:01,400
and you're not just
driving us home illegally.

395
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:03,869
- I did.
- Good.

396
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:05,537
I know.

397
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:08,097
And how was your tester
guy, was he a monster?

398
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,037
He was fine.

399
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:13,354
Slightly distracted.

400
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,204
Transitioning to a career as a DJ,

401
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:18,284
but apparently none of
the venues around here

402
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:21,120
could handle his sound...

403
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:23,022
See? I told you.

404
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:24,790
He didn't care.

405
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:26,625
You never trust me!

406
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,727
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't!

407
00:16:28,762 --> 00:16:30,229
Yes, I do.

408
00:16:30,263 --> 00:16:31,764
No, and you never take my advice.

409
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:34,401
And I'm always the
last person you turn to.

410
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:36,065
What do you want me to say?

411
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,814
Well like, what makes me
different than Stevie or Mom?

412
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:40,472
You trust them with stuff.

413
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:42,902
Okay, you wanna talk trust?!

414
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:45,621
Stevie and Mom weren't
running around the world

415
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:47,970
for a decade and a half with random men,

416
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:50,182
leaving me at home to wonder
whether they were okay!

417
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:52,851
Well, I'm sorry for having fun, David.

418
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,751
With a selection of very
confident international men.

419
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:58,390
- But I was always okay.
- Were you?!

420
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:00,367
Because I was the one at the consulate

421
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:01,759
sending you temporary passports,

422
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:04,034
and colored contacts lenses
whenever you needed them.

423
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,634
I was the one at home,

424
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,301
not having fun because I was...

425
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:13,400
constantly worried
which East Asian palace

426
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:15,933
Alexis was being held
hostage in this week.

427
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,953
Not Mom and Dad.

428
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:20,108
Me!

429
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,043
Well, you didn't have to worry about me.

430
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,064
Well, I did.

431
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,454
(Birds chirp)

432
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:39,775
Ray: As your realtor
I would take pictures,

433
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,166
arrange viewings,

434
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,042
dress each room with
complimentary baskets

435
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,703
of plastic foods.

436
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:46,271
Okay, and if we're going to do this,

437
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:48,240
what would the timeline be like?

438
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:50,793
The sooner the better, I
have my camera in the car.

439
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:52,440
What's going on?

440
00:17:52,691 --> 00:17:54,580
Ray and I are just discussing...

441
00:17:54,614 --> 00:17:56,074
Selling the motel.

442
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,884
I have to weigh all
the options, Mr. Rose.

443
00:17:59,051 --> 00:18:01,457
Yeah, I thought we talked about this?

444
00:18:02,021 --> 00:18:03,129
Ray came to me.

445
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:05,957
There's never been a
better time to sell a motel.

446
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:08,783
It's a terrible time to sell this motel.

447
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:10,941
Either way, in reality,

448
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:13,119
it's always best to tell the
client what they want to hear.

449
00:18:13,144 --> 00:18:16,314
Yeah, but I think
selling is not necessarily

450
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,904
the best way to solve a problem.

451
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,484
Maybe we should discuss
this at a later date,

452
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:24,215
or um, when Mr. Rose has left the room.

453
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:26,252
Well, I'm not leaving,

454
00:18:26,277 --> 00:18:27,913
and Stevie's not selling.

455
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:29,515
I might be selling.

456
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:32,050
I-I can't do this on my own, so.

457
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:35,426
Well, maybe not on your own, but um...

458
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,902
what if you had a partner?

459
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:41,226
Stevie, as your agent,

460
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:43,791
I would advise against
partnering with somebody

461
00:18:43,816 --> 00:18:45,431
who has no capital,

462
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:48,233
no contacts, no industry experience.

463
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:50,346
Well, thank you, Ray, but
I did run a big corporation,

464
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,574
and I'm perfectly
capable of handling this.

465
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:55,908
And I think it's...

466
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:57,609
something I wanna do.

467
00:18:57,644 --> 00:19:00,746
Oh well, this is all very exciting.

468
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,715
However, if any of this
falls through for any reason,

469
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,150
perhaps one of the ones I mentioned,

470
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,582
then... do give me a call.

471
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:09,355
Well, Stevie's not selling.

472
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:11,929
- Here's my card.
- Yeah. Okay.

473
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,560
(Stevie sighs)

474
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:17,796
You don't have to do this, Mr. Rose.

475
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:19,619
Well, it's not charity, Stevie.

476
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:20,866
I mean...

477
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,534
I'll take a percentage of the profits,

478
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:25,137
if and when this place ever sees any.

479
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:26,926
You're actually serious?

480
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:30,355
I'm getting more serious by the second.

481
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,950
Any help you need,
accounting, sales, marketing...

482
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:35,342
Plumbing?

483
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:38,550
Plumbing, yes, it might keep
me away from the books, but...

484
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:41,053
Oh, thank you so much!

485
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:43,856
Oh! I'm sorry.

486
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,472
Oh my gosh.

487
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:47,137
(Stevie laughs)

488
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:55,143
Yeah I just feel like the
whole session was rushed

489
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:56,602
Like, there was no back lighting,

490
00:19:56,636 --> 00:19:57,793
or emotional direction.

491
00:19:57,818 --> 00:20:00,043
Nobody likes their driver's
license photo, David.

492
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:02,303
Okay yeah, I was just hoping
I would get some options.

493
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:03,496
- Well...
- Ohhh!

494
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:04,280
It's done.

495
00:20:04,305 --> 00:20:06,556
Have you been in
there the whole time?!

496
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,249
The sink doesn't fix itself.

497
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,208
Moira? Kids?

498
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:11,600
Check it out.

499
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:15,902
- Ugh.
- (David scoffs)

500
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:24,431
Okay kids, give it a spin.

501
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:27,467
Ahem.

502
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:30,841
(Water splashes)

503
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:35,974
You changed it so that the hot water

504
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,230
comes out of the cold water tap?

505
00:20:37,255 --> 00:20:38,855
No, I fixed the drip.

506
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,879
- Now, turn it off.
- What are we all looking at?

507
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:43,660
Um, Dad messed up our tap.

508
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:45,808
No, I fixed the drip.
Turn it off, honey.

509
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,387
It's getting hotter.

510
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,710
Okay well, turn it
the other way, then.

511
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:49,262
Turn it off!

512
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:51,422
Ow! Ow! It's burning my hand now!

513
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,722
- I see steam, John.
- Okay, well, how do you turn it off?

514
00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:55,824
- It's a tap, just turn it off!
- I turned it off!

515
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:57,617
Good! Good!

516
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,759
See? No drip.

517
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:07,901
I'm gonna go.

518
00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:09,327
Ow!

519
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,540
(Thumps)

520
00:21:14,852 --> 00:21:18,320

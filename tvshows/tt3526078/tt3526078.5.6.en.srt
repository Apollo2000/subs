1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,920
Oh Johnny, I
wish you had told us

2
00:00:02,945 --> 00:00:04,612
it was uh, movie day.

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:05,880
Stevie and I could've come up

4
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,507
with some good recommendations for you.

5
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:08,432
What are we gonna watch,

6
00:00:08,457 --> 00:00:09,804
a silent movie from your childhood?

7
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:11,067
It's not movie day, Roland.

8
00:00:11,092 --> 00:00:13,256
We're watching an instructional video

9
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:14,670
on professional workplace etiquette,

10
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:17,125
and it's clear from
the stain on your top

11
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,254
that things have gotten just
a little lax around here.

12
00:00:22,704 --> 00:00:24,524
I made this at Rose Video a while back,

13
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:27,625
but uh, I think you'll find
it holds up pretty well.

14
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,996
<i>Employee
Health and Safety Series.</i>

15
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:33,099
Where is it? Let's see.

16
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:34,468
Oh wow, this looks like the videos

17
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,259
Joce and I used to make.

18
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,970
Just focus on the content, Roland.

19
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:40,339
"Q, R, S," ah!

20
00:00:40,364 --> 00:00:41,965
There it is.

21
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,023
Here, let me help you with that.

22
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:47,750
Excuse me, Emilio!

23
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:49,460
Pause.

24
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:54,010
That kind of physical
touch is inapprop-ri-rate.

25
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,489
Let's rewind, and try again.

26
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,392
And now they're gonna come
and do it again!

27
00:01:03,852 --> 00:01:05,920
Where is it? Let's see.

28
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:09,569
"Q, R, S," oh!

29
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:10,660
There it is.

30
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:12,906
Here, let me help you with that.

31
00:01:14,098 --> 00:01:16,199
Is this what you were looking for?

32
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:18,144
A double-cassette of
the "Best Body Swaps

33
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:20,537
of Sunrise Bay", Season 21?

34
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:22,281
Yes, thank you.

35
00:01:22,306 --> 00:01:24,559
I've been asked to
retrieve it for a customer

36
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,452
with wonderful taste.

37
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:28,718
I value you as a fellow employee.

38
00:01:29,112 --> 00:01:30,590
Perhaps you'd like to
meet outside of work

39
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:32,289
for a dinner at my place?

40
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,118
Fast forward!

41
00:01:35,143 --> 00:01:36,777
- Oh!
- Jesus.

42
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:39,498
Well, it's somewhat dated, but uh...

43
00:01:39,523 --> 00:01:41,157
I think the principles of etiquette

44
00:01:41,182 --> 00:01:43,421
are still applicable today.

45
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,528
Hm. Pretty timeless. Yeah.

46
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:54,656
No, I'm not gonna be
the one to tell her.

47
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,815
Tell me what?

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,125
No, it's not about you, Moira.

49
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,122
Well, is it about Twyla
needing to pick up the pace

50
00:02:00,147 --> 00:02:02,054
- on that solo?
- What?

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,833
No, it's about the
Poison concert tonight

52
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,959
being canceled at the casino.

53
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:08,937
And that's a problem because?

54
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,130
Jocelyn's been looking
forward to it for weeks.

55
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,698
This is her one night out.

56
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:15,410
Not to worry. If she's
anything like I was

57
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,802
with a little moppet in the house,

58
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:19,396
she'll find any ruse to
escape for an evening.

59
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:21,974
The Poison concert was merely a device.

60
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:27,137
Uh oh, ladies!

61
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:28,938
Somebody better call Poison Control,

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,840
because tonight's gonna be...

63
00:02:30,865 --> 00:02:34,194
♪ Nothin' but a good time! ♪

64
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:36,952
Yeah, I'm not gonna be
the one to... oh, okay.

65
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:38,882
Jocelyn, you might want to take a seat.

66
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:40,708
Oh no, there's no time for that.

67
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:42,928
No, no, we have to
rehearse our Poison medley.

68
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:45,407
Because when Rikki Rockett
makes direct eye contact

69
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,133
with you during "Talk Dirty to Me",

70
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:49,793
you are gonna want to talk dirty back!

71
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:51,861
Oh gals, this is getting painful.

72
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:54,807
Jocelyn, wonderful news!
They've refunded the price

73
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:57,067
of your ticket for tonight's concert.

74
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:59,421
What? But I don't want a refund.

75
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,347
No, the show got pushed.

76
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:04,359
Looks like they double-booked
Poison with The Doodlebops.

77
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,652
And the casino just sent out an apology.

78
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:08,645
Well, what are we supposed to do now?!

79
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:10,880
I didn't pump for four hours straight

80
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:12,415
to get on a chartered bus

81
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,775
to go to the end of the street and back!

82
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,529
We could go to the cafe.

83
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:19,775
Oh! Well, do they have a
smoke machine at the cafe?!

84
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,461
No, but I can ask George to
burn something on the grill.

85
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:23,869
This is just sad.

86
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:25,895
Why can't we still go to the casino?

87
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,588
If I'm holding the truth stick,

88
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:30,309
I was never planning to
attend the concert anyway.

89
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:33,828
I never pegged you for a
gambling kind of gal, Moira.

90
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:37,207
Oh, I'm not above a
naughty night of debauchery.

91
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,018
When Condi Rice, and Sharon Stone and I,

92
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:41,354
used to make our annual casino sojourn

93
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,113
to Ho Chi Minh City,

94
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,881
well, let's just say,
toi khong bao gio thua.

95
00:03:47,529 --> 00:03:49,595
Okay, but it's been a really long time

96
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,488
since I've spun that roulette wheel.

97
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:53,767
And this is the only casino
I haven't been banned from

98
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,631
as an unaccompanied minor.

99
00:03:55,926 --> 00:03:57,406
Well, do we still have a reservation

100
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:59,362
at Bucky's Fried Chicken House?

101
00:03:59,463 --> 00:04:02,298
Yes, but I wouldn't let that stop us!

102
00:04:05,926 --> 00:04:07,646
So you just
plug in the information,

103
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:09,231
and then it creates the website for you.

104
00:04:09,256 --> 00:04:11,491
So what exactly am I
paying you for, then?

105
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:13,018
I'm your brand consultant, David.

106
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:15,888
I'm consulting with you
on which template to use.

107
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:19,593
Sorry, I'm just distracted,
there's a guy over there

108
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:21,518
currently flirting with my boyfriend.

109
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:23,796
- Poor thing.
- I know.

110
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:26,156
No, I meant you, David.

111
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:29,297
Oh hi, are you finding
everything you're looking for?

112
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:30,794
Um, actually, I was wondering

113
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:32,152
if I could have a pen and paper?

114
00:04:32,177 --> 00:04:34,774
Hm, you planning on
doing some journaling?

115
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,065
Hmm.

116
00:04:37,368 --> 00:04:39,158
- There you go.
- Thank you.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

118
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:55,694
Um... score, Patrick!

119
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:58,788
Look at you, just drowning in
other people's phone numbers.

120
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:02,282
Who was that hunk with the
teeny-weeny little polo?

121
00:05:02,444 --> 00:05:04,970
- His name is Ken.
- Ken!

122
00:05:04,995 --> 00:05:06,529
Just when I thought it was impossible

123
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:08,641
to find a thirty-something named Ken!

124
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:10,482
Oh, I think he looked younger than 30.

125
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:11,701
Get fucked Alexis!

126
00:05:11,802 --> 00:05:13,870
What exactly did Ken do with my pen?

127
00:05:13,895 --> 00:05:15,714
Did he write down a banana bread recipe?

128
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:18,675
Or was he looking for
directions to some place?

129
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,001
- This is his phone number.
- Yes, it is.

130
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,556
Yeah. Look at you go.

131
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:25,014
- Mhmm.
- And he like...

132
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,395
gave it to you in front of David,

133
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,154
so clearly no threat there.

134
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:29,686
Hey Alexis, find a stick...

135
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,121
Can I at just enjoy this for a second?

136
00:05:32,146 --> 00:05:34,366
Of course, yeah! Enjoy Ken.

137
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:35,902
I mean, I think it's
funny 'cause when he first

138
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:38,179
walked in here I was gonna help him,

139
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,673
so to think it could've
been me enjoying Ken.

140
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:42,232
Yeah, I don't think so.

141
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,243
- Yeah, I think he liked me.
- This is fun!

142
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:45,879
It's the great thing about
owning a store, really,

143
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:47,804
is getting to flirt with the customers.

144
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,097
You know, just last week,

145
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:50,860
A woman came in and gave me her number.

146
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,751
Do you mean the woman who wanted to know

147
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:54,154
when the soap would be back in stock?

148
00:05:54,178 --> 00:05:56,113
Who came in here with
her husband and kids?

149
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,348
Hasn't stopped me before.

150
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:00,360
But thank you for reminding
me, I have to call her,

151
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:01,792
the soap did come back in.

152
00:06:03,454 --> 00:06:05,088
I'm just gonna...

153
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:06,613
put that right there.

154
00:06:06,638 --> 00:06:08,406
Mhmm.

155
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:10,734
<i>Stevie?</i>

156
00:06:10,858 --> 00:06:12,025
<i>Just a minute!</i>

157
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,398
Oh, I was talking to Roland
about the latticework,

158
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:18,444
and we figure if we uh,
put the vines right up

159
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:19,980
- the side of the motel... oh!
- Oh! Oh!

160
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,804
Oh my God, Mr. Rose! Oh!

161
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:24,829
Okay. No, no, no, that's okay.

162
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:25,988
I'm sorry.

163
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:28,311
- I said just a minute!
- Yeah. Yeah.

164
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,422
No, I-I was coming back to you,

165
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:31,954
because I-I figured, you know,

166
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,814
you'd be busy back there. I was busy!

167
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,390
- Taking a personal photo...
- Right, right.

168
00:06:37,415 --> 00:06:38,655
For my doctor.

169
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,042
Right, well, it was, it
was a medical uh, photo,

170
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,701
and, and uh... and you what?

171
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:45,246
You text or email this
right back to your doctor,

172
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,740
I mean, what a-what an age we live in!

173
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:49,299
I thought you were running errands!

174
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:51,810
I was, I was, and-and uh...

175
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:53,736
I was at the nursery, there were no cars

176
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:56,315
absolutely on the way home, and uh,

177
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,740
so it was clear sailing,

178
00:06:57,765 --> 00:07:00,052
and that's what I was
gonna tell you when I...

179
00:07:00,077 --> 00:07:01,344
- until I...
- Okay!

180
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:04,189
I am kind of seeing somebody,

181
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:06,325
and it's like, a
long-distance thing, so I...

182
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,328
Yeah, okay, I'm gonna stop,
I'm gonna stop you right there.

183
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:10,632
I wish we had gotten to the second tape

184
00:07:10,657 --> 00:07:12,431
in the workplace etiquette series,

185
00:07:12,456 --> 00:07:15,077
that had a whole chunk on Polaroids.

186
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,303
- Oh my God!
- Um, Stevie, look, look!

187
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:19,762
All I saw was a business
partner communicating

188
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,640
with a friend, that's all.

189
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:23,399
Although you've just explained

190
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:25,253
that it was a more intimate relationship

191
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,445
with this uh, chap.

192
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,556
But uh, congratulations, by the way.

193
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,848
If-if uh, you know.

194
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:33,361
I think I need to take
a walk around the block.

195
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,854
- Mhmm?
- So, like, a couple of thousand times.

196
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,999
Okay, that's a good
idea. Yeah, sure, sure.

197
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,892
Take a walk. And uh, you know,

198
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,203
uh, get some, get some fresh air,

199
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,796
and you know, clear your head.

200
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:46,274
And if you feel the need
to finish that communication

201
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,866
by the way, with your friend,

202
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:50,712
just uh, maybe try and find
a room with a locked door?

203
00:07:51,962 --> 00:07:54,330
But everything's okay Stevie,
don't worry about that.

204
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:56,532
We're...

205
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,335
- I waited 35 minutes!
- Oh, don't start.

206
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,817
Oh, please, save your
applause for Jocelyn,

207
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:06,818
who's right behind me.

208
00:08:06,843 --> 00:08:08,821
You know what? I was going
to change and then I thought,

209
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:11,790
no, if my babysitter can
show up wearing a crop top

210
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:15,503
the size of a bib, I can
wear this to a casino!

211
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:18,121
Jocelyn, you look amazing.

212
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:21,367
Yes, why not throw caution
and the dress code to the wind?

213
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:23,570
I'm sure the maître d' at
Bucky's will make an exception!

214
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:26,887
Let's get goin'!

215
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:31,200
If the bus is a-rockin',
don't come a-knockin'!

216
00:08:31,225 --> 00:08:32,859
Wooo! Yeah!

217
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:37,916
I've come prepared
with casino must-haves:

218
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:40,528
oxygen drops, antibacterial wipes,

219
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,622
and military-grade caffeine pills.

220
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:45,214
The pills came from Condi,

221
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:47,893
so if anyone asks, you
found them on the floor.

222
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,963
Mrs. Rose, when you said
you were bringing essentials,

223
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,789
I thought you meant snacks,
and something to drink.

224
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,366
No.

225
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:56,391
- Well, nothing for the road?
- Don't worry ladies,

226
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:58,961
I've got you covered, this
afternoon I made some...

227
00:08:58,986 --> 00:09:02,274
magic brownies!

228
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:04,200
THC and carbohydrates.

229
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,712
Oh Moira, we don't
expect you to have one.

230
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:08,204
One? At least one.

231
00:09:08,305 --> 00:09:10,056
Okay...

232
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:13,042
Who wants some zhampagne?

233
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,468
Yeah! Wooo!

234
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:22,819
So, whatever happened
to that phone number?

235
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,655
Uh, it might still be in my pocket. Why?

236
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:28,057
Hm. Just keeping it close?

237
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:29,850
Well, I haven't thrown it out yet.

238
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,413
What are you doing?! I'm
obviously not gonna use it.

239
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:35,631
Why not?

240
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,710
Uh, because I'm in a
committed relationship.

241
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:38,842
I know that.

242
00:09:40,637 --> 00:09:43,639
- I think you should call him.
- What?!

243
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:45,575
Skin-tight clothes aside,

244
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:47,553
do you find Ken attractive?

245
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,655
I mean, sure.

246
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,214
Then I think you should call him!

247
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:52,284
David!

248
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:54,426
Consider it a selfish act on my part.

249
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:56,085
You have only been with me.

250
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,330
And Rachel, and like, a
handful of other girls.

251
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:00,656
Okay, we've all been with
a handful of other girls.

252
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:02,925
- But I'm the only guy.
- So?

253
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:05,113
So inevitably there might come a point

254
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,972
where you find yourself curious

255
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:08,831
about being with other people.

256
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,809
So why not explore that now,

257
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:13,054
so that we don't have
to have this conversation

258
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,646
five years down the line.

259
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:17,706
Oh, so you think we're gonna
be together 5-years from now?

260
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:19,952
I think a cute boy gave you his number,

261
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:23,312
and you should go for
dinner, and run free.

262
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,823
Best case scenario,

263
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:26,816
you realize how good
you have it with me.

264
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:28,742
Worst case scenario,

265
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:30,419
you realize how good
you have it with me.

266
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,652
Fun!

267
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:39,677
Okay, Mr. Rose?

268
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,342
Uh, I've thought a lot
about what happened,

269
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,553
uh, maybe a little too
much about what happened.

270
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,180
And I think for the
sake of the business,

271
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:51,309
that we should just
put it all behind us.

272
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,453
- Okay, good.
- Good.

273
00:10:54,478 --> 00:10:56,078
Thank you, Stevie.

274
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,591
What happened?

275
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,161
Mr. Rose saw me topless.

276
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:04,405
- Oh! Oh!
- No! No!

277
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,065
I... I didn't completely see anything,

278
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,792
but I got the gist of
what you were doing.

279
00:11:09,893 --> 00:11:11,460
I didn't know anyone was here!

280
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:13,596
Oh Johnny,

281
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:16,451
I don't think the woman in
that video would approve.

282
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,243
The woman on the video is Moira,

283
00:11:18,268 --> 00:11:20,336
and no, she would not
approve! I would not approve!

284
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:21,862
It was an accident.

285
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:24,449
Trust me, it will never happen again.

286
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:25,641
Understood.

287
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,719
I really don't know what
to say to the two of you.

288
00:11:27,744 --> 00:11:29,289
Well, you don't have
to say anything, Roland.

289
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,723
Less is more in a...
situation like this.

290
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:33,228
Well, I did just think of one thing.

291
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,894
- Please don't!
- It's more of a limerick.

292
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:36,352
All right, enough, Roland.

293
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:37,911
Thank you, we're going to move on now.

294
00:11:37,936 --> 00:11:40,399
Stevie, Room Three needs a change over.

295
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:42,314
I would be happy to leave and do that.

296
00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:45,623
Thanks.

297
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:47,530
Whoa!

298
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:50,075
Aah! Stevie! Your friend just responded!

299
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,201
- Oh my God, gimme that!
- Hmm.

300
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,946
Oh my...

301
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,450
uh, I'll be taking the
rest of the day off.

302
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:01,119
Okay.

303
00:12:01,144 --> 00:12:03,045
Yeah...

304
00:12:03,146 --> 00:12:04,780
I'd say her friend responded.

305
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:14,939
Hey, can you
give me a ride to Ted's?

306
00:12:14,964 --> 00:12:16,631
It's basically on the way to Patrick's.

307
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:18,108
It's in the opposite direction,

308
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:20,134
and I'm not going to Patrick's tonight.

309
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,293
Why?

310
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,237
Because we don't have plans tonight.

311
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:26,180
- He has plans with someone else.
- Who?

312
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,767
Okay, can you utilize like,

313
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:29,486
a little bit more of
the English language?

314
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:31,045
If you must know,

315
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,815
I sent Patrick off to
have dinner with that guy

316
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,533
who gave him his number today.

317
00:12:34,761 --> 00:12:36,896
That hot piece from the store?

318
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:38,327
Why would you do that?

319
00:12:38,428 --> 00:12:40,229
Because I think it's funny,

320
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,570
and I also think it's important
for Patrick to experience

321
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,533
other people in order to realize

322
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:47,270
how good he has it with me.

323
00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:49,739
What if he doesn't come
to that realization?

324
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,317
Every time I did that with a boyfriend,

325
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:53,643
I'd send them off with someone
who like, wasn't a threat.

326
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:56,178
Like, Pippa Middleton, or Rihanna.

327
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,649
Okay, well, I hardly
think Ken is a threat.

328
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,718
Mm, tell that to his
million dollar smile, David.

329
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:05,321
- Okay.
- So what are the GRs?

330
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:07,523
- The what?
- The ground rules.

331
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:09,492
What ground rules did you lay down

332
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:12,260
before you sent him off
with that hottie-boom-bottie?

333
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:16,065
Okay, I haven't sent him
off with ground rules,

334
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,458
because this is a one-night thing.

335
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:20,536
Did you say that?

336
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:22,071
No.

337
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:24,049
So at this point he could like,

338
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:25,541
spend the night, double-dip,

339
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,452
- kiss on the lips!
- I don't know!

340
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:29,578
Okay, this is why you
have ground rules, David!

341
00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:31,690
Josh Groban has a thick,
leather-bound binder

342
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:32,924
full of them.

343
00:13:32,971 --> 00:13:34,594
Patrick didn't even wanna do this.

344
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:36,894
I basically forced him into it.

345
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:38,955
Is it too late for any amendments?

346
00:13:39,056 --> 00:13:40,623
I thought this was a good idea,

347
00:13:40,648 --> 00:13:43,101
and now you're making me
feel like I made a mistake.

348
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:45,071
Okay, you haven't made a
huge mistake yet, David,

349
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:47,937
we probably won't find out
about that until tomorrow.

350
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:52,177
Okay, I have never been
in this position before,

351
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:54,112
usually I'm the one finding out

352
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:56,491
I'm in an open
relationship after the fact,

353
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:59,151
and now you're making me
feel like I've just shipped

354
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:02,244
my boyfriend off to fall
in love with someone else!

355
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,466
Ugh! I was supposed to go
to dinner with Ted, David!

356
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:07,092
Then go for dinner with Ted!

357
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:09,218
Well, now I feel like I
should be here for you!

358
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:11,029
Why?

359
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,398
Let's just hope we don't find out.

360
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:15,233
What?!

361
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:16,592
Ugh...

362
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:28,456
Are we up yet?

363
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,658
It's either black or red, even or odd.

364
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:33,118
And you never know
where you're gonna land.

365
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:34,610
I'm sorry, Jocelyn?

366
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:36,012
If you'd've told me 20 years ago

367
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:37,757
I'd be standing here
with an empty chip bucket,

368
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:39,915
stoned out of my mind
at a Doodlebops concert,

369
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:42,618
I would've lit a
menthol, and had a laugh.

370
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,086
You went to that show?

371
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:45,221
I stepped in briefly,

372
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,090
Roland Jr.'s a huge
fan of "Wobbly Whoopsy."

373
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,977
Moira, you may not believe this,

374
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:52,471
but I used to rock out.

375
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:54,106
Well, of course you did,

376
00:14:54,131 --> 00:14:56,645
as did anyone with brain cells to kill.

377
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:58,810
I'm thinking of a
particular night in Monaco

378
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:01,804
with Maggie Trudeau
and the Rolling Stones.

379
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:04,373
You rocked with the Stones?

380
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:07,362
All except Charlie, but
every party has a pooper.

381
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:10,355
Moira, it's like,

382
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,449
on the inside I feel
like I'm 19-years-old,

383
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,402
and then I catch a glimpse
of myself in the mirror,

384
00:15:16,427 --> 00:15:19,898
and realize that I'm so not.

385
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:24,102
Oh Jocelyn, you'll soon
learn that we aging mortals

386
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:26,772
are blessed with
weakening eyes and memories

387
00:15:26,797 --> 00:15:29,971
so we don't have to
really see ourselves.

388
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:34,179
If you love the number 19, you go be 19.

389
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:37,206
And while you're at it, bet on it.

390
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:39,084
I can't take all of these!

391
00:15:39,109 --> 00:15:41,070
It only looks like a lot.

392
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:44,056
Do as you will. Jocelyn,
but whatever you do,

393
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:47,492
rock onwards and upwards!

394
00:15:47,543 --> 00:15:49,377
Mhmm!

395
00:15:49,634 --> 00:15:51,068
Yeah!

396
00:16:04,158 --> 00:16:06,026
- Ah, Stevie.
- Oh my God!

397
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:07,712
I forgot my bag,

398
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:09,816
and I thought you might have
gone home for the night, so...

399
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,674
Oh no, I was just
about to leave, but uh,

400
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,195
I'm glad I caught you.

401
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:16,961
Can we pretend today didn't happen?

402
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,968
Oh, consider it erased.

403
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:21,026
Thank you.

404
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:23,662
Although, I did wanna
say just one thing,

405
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:27,056
if I could put my friend
cap on for a minute.

406
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:28,633
I'm glad things are working out

407
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:30,542
with you and your gentleman friend.

408
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:33,901
And I'm just piecing
things together here.

409
00:16:34,764 --> 00:16:36,499
Thank you, Mr. Rose.

410
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,100
I hope he makes you happy, Stevie,

411
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,010
and that's all that matters to me.

412
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:42,814
And from this point forward,
I am staying out of it.

413
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,018
We never have to talk about this again.

414
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:47,800
Okay.

415
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:50,088
Remember Emir?

416
00:16:50,113 --> 00:16:52,214
The guy who came to review the motel?

417
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:54,783
The one who asked you to lunch?

418
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:57,386
Yes, that would be him.

419
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:01,199
Oh! Well, he seems like a nice guy.

420
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:02,791
- Yeah.
- Good job.

421
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:04,660
Good taste in motels.

422
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:07,763
And clearly he likes you a lot.

423
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:10,122
And I'm not saying that
just because of the photo.

424
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:11,333
Oh my God, Mr. Rose!

425
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:13,445
- Okay, rewind, please.
- See you tomorrow!

426
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,571
Yeah, okay, see you tomorrow, Stevie.

427
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,574
Does anyone want more Bucky's?

428
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:22,311
No! Who knew everything
would contain chicken?

429
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:24,737
Oh, that dessert menu was
especially disappointing.

430
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:26,549
"Black forest tenders."

431
00:17:26,574 --> 00:17:28,493
Jocelyn's still not answering her phone.

432
00:17:28,518 --> 00:17:31,574
Well, somebody ought to go look for her!

433
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:35,925
Tah-dah!

434
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,337
Oh, Jocelyn, is that you?

435
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:41,749
Yes! I took your advice, Moira.

436
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:43,642
And what advice was that?!

437
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:46,639
Yes, Jocelyn, what advice did I impart

438
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:50,406
that translated into
this daring new coiffure?

439
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,617
That I can still rock on!

440
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:54,243
Your chips bought this!

441
00:17:54,268 --> 00:17:56,955
And you certainly risked
it all, didn't you?

442
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,281
Yeah!

443
00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:01,039
I'm ready to go home.

444
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:02,551
Okay.

445
00:18:02,652 --> 00:18:04,420
Wow, Jocelyn.

446
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:06,021
It must feel so light and breezy.

447
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:07,890
Mhmm!

448
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:09,825
Ha ha! Yeah.

449
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:11,727
Yes, I love it, too.

450
00:18:11,752 --> 00:18:14,506
I know. Thank you.

451
00:18:14,531 --> 00:18:17,199
Thank you.

452
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:19,277
Do you recognize me from earlier?

453
00:18:19,302 --> 00:18:21,003
I have a new hairdo!

454
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:23,724
Hey Ted, I'll be there soon,

455
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:26,017
but I just can't leave
David alone right now.

456
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:28,877
Yeah, no, apparently they
left for dinner at seven.

457
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:30,269
Radio silence.

458
00:18:30,294 --> 00:18:31,994
Nothing, not a word.

459
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:35,794
Anyway, I will be there
soon, and I love you so much.

460
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:36,885
Okay...

461
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:38,520
Oh my God, imagine?

462
00:18:38,622 --> 00:18:40,856
Muah! Muah!

463
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,688
This is not how I
wanted to spend my night.

464
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,960
Me neither.

465
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:46,581
And David, I know what you're thinking,

466
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,497
they're probably back at his house,

467
00:18:48,598 --> 00:18:51,543
listening to Frank Ocean,
laughing, and re-hydrating.

468
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:53,369
Yeah, the more I think about this,

469
00:18:53,394 --> 00:18:55,580
the more I realize it was way too early

470
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:57,673
to have introduced this
into the relationship.

471
00:18:57,698 --> 00:18:59,584
I mean, I thought I was being mature,

472
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:02,830
but in actuality, it
was just a classic case

473
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:04,489
of self-sabotage.

474
00:19:04,514 --> 00:19:06,448
Chill, David.

475
00:19:06,473 --> 00:19:08,074
Hey!

476
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,854
Yes, those are all valid points,

477
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:14,347
but this is a moment of growth for you.

478
00:19:14,524 --> 00:19:17,326
Was it flawlessly executed? No.

479
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:18,827
Would I have done it?

480
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:19,995
Hell no.

481
00:19:20,096 --> 00:19:21,964
Okay, if this is intended to be helpful,

482
00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:25,048
- you can leave now.
- But what I was gonna say is,

483
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:27,303
if a cute guy that walks into your store

484
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:30,072
is enough to unravel
your whole relationship,

485
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:31,907
you're better off knowing that now,

486
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:33,909
than in a year from now.

487
00:19:47,457 --> 00:19:49,559
Do I want to hear about it?

488
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:52,107
I couldn't do it.

489
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,963
Oh. Come in.

490
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,933
I don't want to date Ken!

491
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,359
I don't think I ever said "date".

492
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:01,351
Was it the lack of ground rules?

493
00:20:01,376 --> 00:20:03,257
- Hi. David...
- Mhmm?

494
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:06,341
I love you, and I really appreciate

495
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:07,686
what you were trying to do for me,

496
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:11,342
but I feel no need to meet
up with other guys right now.

497
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,492
Okay, I mean...

498
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:16,685
if that's what you
want, then I guess I'm...

499
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,358
I'm fine with it, I
mean, I'm easy either way.

500
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:20,772
Oh.

501
00:20:24,835 --> 00:20:27,081
Also, this is gonna sound totally petty,

502
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:30,108
but something about his shoes
just made me feel really weird,

503
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:32,668
'cause they were like,
long and pointy, but then...

504
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:34,127
- Squared off at the toe.
- Yes!

505
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:36,748
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know. I know, it's okay.

506
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,674
It's okay.

507
00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:43,488
Okay, this is a really long hug now.

508
00:20:43,513 --> 00:20:45,952
Just need one more minute, mhmm.

509
00:20:53,977 --> 00:20:56,812
We all still like it, right?

510
00:20:57,077 --> 00:20:59,616
I think it really brings
out my eyes, right, Gals?

511
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:01,109
Sure.

512
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:02,856
It's not like we think it's a mistake,

513
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:05,299
or we regret it, right?

514
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,402
Oh, you never regret
a good time, Jocelyn.

515
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:09,736
Thank you, Moira.

516
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:11,872
You'd tell me the truth, I know.

517
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:14,936
It's really short.

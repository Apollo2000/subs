1
00:00:06,814 --> 00:00:10,217
They call this a candidates' breakfast?!

2
00:00:10,702 --> 00:00:12,169
Well, it can't be, Moira,

3
00:00:12,204 --> 00:00:14,131
there's a woman in cargo shorts.

4
00:00:14,157 --> 00:00:16,324
Good morning, Mrs.
Rose. Here's your name tag.

5
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:18,009
Oh, bless you, dear, but a name tag

6
00:00:18,044 --> 00:00:19,678
does not go with this ensemble.

7
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:21,679
Oh, it's just so
people know who you are.

8
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:23,248
Not that people won't know,

9
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:25,516
when they see you in that outfit.

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,051
It's very shiny.

11
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,468
You're too kind.

12
00:00:29,554 --> 00:00:32,156
Well, I'm glad you
talked me out of the Mohawk.

13
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:34,024
I think these people
deserve a little glamour

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,726
in their political campaign.

15
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:38,128
I was always impressed by
those masquerade key parties

16
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:39,564
at the Sarkosy's.

17
00:00:39,597 --> 00:00:41,585
Hey Johnny, good morning to you.

18
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,576
- Roland.
- How are 'ya?

19
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:46,902
And Elvis! I'm so
glad you could make it.

20
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:50,387
Excuse me?!

21
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:52,335
Well, because you look
like Elvis in that...

22
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,661
outfit there, you know, and...

23
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:57,366
but the early Elvis, not the...

24
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:00,685
Okay Roland, stop it.

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,356
Moira, all anyone can
talk about is that outfit.

26
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:06,924
Hah!

27
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,992
You are a hit!

28
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:12,629
Huh, well no one has said as such to me.

29
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:14,265
It's just that, you know,

30
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:15,599
what you're wearing is
something that people

31
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:17,635
around here aren't really used to,

32
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,460
or comfortable with.

33
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:21,319
But that's what makes it great.

34
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:24,408
Oh, this is going to be a fun campaign.

35
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:27,078
- Yeah, I think it already is.
- Mhmm...

36
00:01:28,212 --> 00:01:32,828
Credit

37
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,539
Hey Johnny, you know
I like to keep some milk

38
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:40,194
in the fridge for myself,
uh... and I noticed it uh...

39
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:44,545
- Mm, some of it was missing.
- Yeah, yeah.

40
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,514
Well, I do admit I
used a bit of your milk,

41
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:49,173
uh, to put in my coffee.

42
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:50,841
It looks more than just a bit.

43
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,414
I mean, the uh... the whole
bottle seems to be gone.

44
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:56,780
Well...

45
00:01:56,814 --> 00:01:59,216
Well, it was very tasty,

46
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,484
and naturally I'll reimburse you for it.

47
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,108
Alright, well, give me seven
bucks, we'll call it even.

48
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,990
- Seven dollars?!
- It's raw milk we're talking here,

49
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,126
it's all natural, unpasteurized,

50
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,562
straight from the cow's
breast, to your mouth.

51
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:14,397
You paid seven dollars
a bottle for this?!

52
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:16,699
- Where do you get it?
- Oh, Johnny, I...

53
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:19,370
I'm not giving up my
supplier. I mean, uh...

54
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:22,717
Unpasteurized milk is... illegal.

55
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:25,141
Yeah, okay, Bob, you know, I get it,

56
00:02:25,175 --> 00:02:27,944
but... we're not talking heroin here.

57
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:29,747
Okay well, you know,

58
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:32,983
maybe you're used to being
on the wrong side of the law,

59
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:35,875
but I for one am not going to prison.

60
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:39,453
Gwen has already told
me she won't wait for me,

61
00:02:39,478 --> 00:02:44,581
so I'm counting on you
to be uh... discreet.

62
00:02:44,606 --> 00:02:47,741
Right, okay Bob, I'll
keep it on the down low.

63
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:54,337
You know, if you expect
me to drive you to work,

64
00:02:54,372 --> 00:02:56,741
it would be nice if
you were ready on time.

65
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:59,209
I am ready!

66
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:00,510
I just have to get my jacket,
change out of these shoes,

67
00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:01,632
and grab my bag.

68
00:03:01,657 --> 00:03:03,524
David? David!

69
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:06,584
David, I have an urgent
campaign related question:

70
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,609
I am approachable...

71
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,540
- Is that a question?
- Yes, the question is:

72
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:16,897
I am approachable...

73
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,132
That sounds more like a fact
that you're sharing with me.

74
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,069
Are you saying you disagree?

75
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:27,737
With your statement? Um...

76
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:29,673
Well, Stevie actually is just
about to drive me to work...

77
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:30,850
- Oh my God!
- Sorry.

78
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,375
So um, maybe I could
give that one a think?

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,312
Stevie! Stevie! You're
an average Joe... Anne.

80
00:03:35,346 --> 00:03:37,448
You must have an opinion.

81
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:41,317
- On what?
- About my approachability.

82
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:43,152
Jocelyn seemed to insinuate

83
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:45,122
that I am not at one with the people.

84
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:46,723
But I've always believed that you lead

85
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:49,679
with your best foot forward,
and the masses will follow!

86
00:03:49,836 --> 00:03:51,336
You sound a bit like a dictator.

87
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:54,531
Oh enough, David. Stevie understands!

88
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:55,966
I'm trying to.

89
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:58,026
Yes! As a strong willed modern woman,

90
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,718
with a high school degree,

91
00:03:59,742 --> 00:04:03,149
you know how hard we have to
work to be taken seriously!

92
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:05,272
I actually went to college, but sure.

93
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:08,211
I would vote for you
based solely on the fact

94
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:10,480
that you wore this outfit
to the cafÃ© for breakfast.

95
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:11,406
Okay.

96
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:14,159
You know, being approachable
isn't that important anyway,

97
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:16,153
The queen hasn't smiled since the 70's,

98
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:18,488
and her birthdays are
still very well attended.

99
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,625
Exactly! Wait.

100
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:23,627
What are you saying?

101
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:37,632
Nice bike!

102
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:44,648
Oh my go... ! Oh my god!

103
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:46,649
- Ted?
- Alexis!

104
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:49,485
You look good.

105
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:52,588
Like, really good, like, super...

106
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:55,057
sun kissed, and muscle-y.

107
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:57,593
Thank you, I've been working out a bit.

108
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:00,531
And travelling, hit the beach
pretty hard for a few weeks.

109
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:02,663
And boy, did it hit me back.

110
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:04,742
Good for you!

111
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:07,137
I was wondering where you ran off to.

112
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:09,605
Yeah well, it's actually
kind of a funny story.

113
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:12,041
Do you remember that couples
vacation that I booked for us

114
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:14,077
right before you broke
off our engagement?

115
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:17,113
Again, I'm-I'm super sorry about that.

116
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:18,389
No, no, it's awesome.

117
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:20,834
'Cause they actually gave me
the "Broken Hearts Special."

118
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,362
Three extra nights at no extra charge,

119
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:24,855
as long as I could prove
that I didn't actually make it

120
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:26,423
down the aisle.

121
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:28,091
Hmm!

122
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,625
Look at you, and now you have a bike!

123
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:32,062
Yeah! Yeah, no, I got
almost full price back

124
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:33,564
for the engagement ring,

125
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:35,331
and I've always wanted one of these,

126
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:37,500
and it cost less than the ring, so...

127
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:40,288
Wow! So you're in like,

128
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:42,235
a really good place right now?

129
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:45,608
Yeah, well, the beach changes you.

130
00:05:45,643 --> 00:05:47,009
Oh... yeah.

131
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:48,545
How about you? What's going on?

132
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:51,545
Yeah, I've just been...
super busy as well.

133
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:53,584
Oh. Yeah no, I hear that.

134
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:57,086
My day's been stacked,
doing rounds to some farms,

135
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,084
checking on the animals,
and now some house calls,

136
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:02,793
But I gotta say, it's a lot more fun

137
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:04,560
now that I've got this puppy.

138
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:05,963
Pun intended.

139
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,067
Look at you!

140
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,702
It's like if the "Sons
of Anarchy" had a vet.

141
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:14,319
Yeah!

142
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:16,005
Except they don't wear
helmets on that show,

143
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,757
Which I get, but, it's
a little dangerous.

144
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,511
Anyway, it's great to see you, Alexis.

145
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:23,523
Totally.

146
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:31,053
Ooh! Ahem!

147
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:51,100
- David!
- Jocelyn! Hi.

148
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:55,129
Are you here picking up
something for yourself?

149
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:59,398
No. No, I um...

150
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:01,504
I work here now.

151
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:03,262
- Oh!
- So...

152
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,517
I usually just come here
when I need to kind of...

153
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:07,658
freshen up my wardrobe.

154
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:09,959
I see, well, enjoy.

155
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:12,495
Just looking for a few
things for the campaign.

156
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:16,699
A couple of pieces that
might catch the eye.

157
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,045
Got it.

158
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:21,637
I've got quite the stiff
competition with your mother.

159
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:24,173
- Mhmm...
- Of course I wouldn't want to create

160
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:26,992
a conflict of interest for you.

161
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:29,038
Got it.

162
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:32,158
Well, I have brought in some
pretty decent pieces to the store,

163
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:34,928
you're just gonna have to search
pretty hard for them, so...

164
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,360
Twyla, I was just wondering,

165
00:07:44,394 --> 00:07:47,303
have you ever carried raw
milk in the restaurant?

166
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:50,233
Um, that's illegal, Mr. Rose.

167
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:53,370
- Yeah.
- Between us,

168
00:07:53,403 --> 00:07:55,372
I had a bad experience
with black market milk.

169
00:07:55,406 --> 00:07:57,173
- Oh?
- Granted, I bought it from a man

170
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:58,908
who I later found out was a drifter.

171
00:07:58,942 --> 00:08:01,043
Anyway, it made a lot of people sick,

172
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,968
and I am almost positive
now it wasn't cow's milk.

173
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,702
- Okay.
- It might've been elk's milk.

174
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:09,619
Is elk's milk a thing? I
don't know. I don't know.

175
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:12,456
I'm just looking for
someone who sells raw milk.

176
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,956
From a cow.

177
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,437
That's a big business right now.

178
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,011
What's a big business right now?

179
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:18,656
- Raw milk.
- Shhh!

180
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:22,406
You would make a terrible
drug dealer, Mr. Rose.

181
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:26,036
You're thinking about
becoming a drug dealer?

182
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:27,603
- Ugh...
- I mean, I get it,

183
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:30,307
it's fast money, and no
one would ever suspect you.

184
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:32,928
I'm thinking of selling raw milk.

185
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:35,490
Oh. I don't think that's right for you.

186
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,548
But selling drugs is?!

187
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:40,015
Okay, I had a friend in
Venice Beach who sold raw milk,

188
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:42,280
and his entire compound was raided.

189
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:45,389
I mean, he also sold drugs, but like...

190
00:08:45,423 --> 00:08:48,392
Well, I just think it can
be... profitable,

191
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:50,803
if I can find a way to capitalize on it.

192
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:53,952
Um... oh!

193
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:56,381
I just saw Ted.

194
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,335
Ted knows a lot of farmers,

195
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:00,327
so maybe he can point you
in the right direction.

196
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:02,438
Oh okay, good, good.

197
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:05,207
Good, maybe you can uh, give him a call?

198
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:07,609
Mm, I just feel like that'd
be kind of awkward right now.

199
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:11,581
You know, your trail of
discarded boyfriends, Alexis,

200
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:14,418
is making it very difficult
to get anything done

201
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:17,653
- in this world.
- Okay! I will call him.

202
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:19,296
Good, thank you.

203
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,443
I'll call him right after my run today.

204
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:25,861
Oh my God, okay, I'll
call him right now.

205
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:28,171
- Good.
- Um...

206
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:30,062
How much milk do we want?

207
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:33,503
Well, let's say twelve pints.

208
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:35,838
And then, we'll see where that gets us.

209
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:38,174
- Okay.
- Okay.

210
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:42,256
Hmm...

211
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:50,337
Does this print come
in a different colour?

212
00:09:52,088 --> 00:09:54,090
Uh, theoretically.

213
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,293
Yeah, um... is it... You're look...

214
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,794
You want to have-you want
that in another colour?

215
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,975
Maybe?

216
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,628
Unless you think that
there's another top

217
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,796
that might be better.

218
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:10,072
Well, I mean, there are
other tops in the store.

219
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:12,975
Uh huh, okay well, maybe you could,

220
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:14,975
without being specific,

221
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:18,114
point me in the general
direction of something

222
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,062
that might be more suitable?

223
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:23,001
Hmm. Well, it's not really up to me.

224
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:26,062
Um, and I am supporting
my mother in this campaign.

225
00:10:26,086 --> 00:10:29,489
- Oh yeah, yeah.
- But if I were you, um...

226
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:32,528
I might look for a...
a blouse maybe in...

227
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:34,928
in this general area.

228
00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:38,610
Uh, maybe a-a skirt, and a jacket.

229
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:40,366
Maybe on this rack here.

230
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,610
But again, it's all
- it's all you. So...

231
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:45,808
Okay!

232
00:10:45,842 --> 00:10:46,875
Thank you, David.

233
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:48,639
For what? I didn't do anything.

234
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,582
Good afternoon, Jazzagals.

235
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:56,552
I have a great warm-up exercise
I'd like to share with you.

236
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:58,754
Oh! Okay, I think
we're just waiting for Jocelyn.

237
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:01,291
Again? I don't know how
anyone can one manage a town

238
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:03,866
when they can't even
manage their own time.

239
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:06,428
Well, I guess we could
start without her.

240
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:08,999
Good! Because I was thinking...

241
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,085
we should get to know each other.

242
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:15,205
Well of course, you all
do know each other already,

243
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,788
But I'd love for you to get to know me.

244
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:21,030
Does anyone have any questions?

245
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:27,738
I am just trying to think.

246
00:11:27,763 --> 00:11:31,687
Maybe this will help... break the ice?

247
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:34,393
We don't usually
drink until after rehearsal.

248
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:35,229
Oh.

249
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:37,661
Uh, unless of course
the drinks are free!

250
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:40,663
Here, let me. Yeah. Open it.

251
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:42,665
Thanks.

252
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:06,332
Alexis?

253
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:15,750
What is this?

254
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:18,000
The twelve things of
milk that you asked for.

255
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:21,100
The twelve "things" of milk?

256
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:24,607
I didn't ask for
twelve "things" of milk,

257
00:12:24,642 --> 00:12:26,327
I didn't-I didn't say "things!"

258
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:28,807
No, I asked for twelve pints!

259
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:30,312
Is there one missing?

260
00:12:30,643 --> 00:12:32,844
- Alexis!
- What?

261
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:34,803
These are not pints!

262
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:37,764
Pints are little bottles!

263
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:39,741
Ohhh!

264
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,957
Okay, 'cause I was
wondering why would Dad order

265
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:44,259
$300.00 worth of milk?

266
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:47,663
This cost $300.00?!

267
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,778
Yeah, well like, three-ish.

268
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:51,730
I don't... hmm.

269
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:55,456
Um... okay well, $394.40,

270
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,879
so I guess kind of closer to $400.

271
00:12:57,904 --> 00:13:03,476
Alexis, what am I gonna do
with $400.00 worth of raw milk?!

272
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,984
- Sell it!
- To whom?!

273
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:08,527
- To your customers!
- I don't have any customers!

274
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:10,575
Well then, why would
you order so much milk?

275
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,465
I didn't! You did!

276
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,124
Okay, why are you yelling at me?

277
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:15,725
Why am I yelling?!

278
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,360
Ugh! I try and do
something nice for somebody,

279
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:20,697
You think I would at least
deserve a "thank you!"

280
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,231
Oh well, thank you, Alexis,

281
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:24,933
thank you for ordering
an insane amount of milk

282
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:27,712
that I will never be able to sell!

283
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:28,966
You're welcome!

284
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:47,846
This is a lot of raw milk, Johnny.

285
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:49,373
Oh, believe me, I know.

286
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:51,174
How many times do you
want me to apologize?!

287
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:53,009
Well, try one, and
let's see what happens.

288
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:55,946
Okay, I'm sorry you weren't
more clear about ordering milk!

289
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,621
Mm, not a proper apology.

290
00:13:57,647 --> 00:13:59,482
Ugh! Okay, quiet, you two!

291
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:02,318
You're scared, all right, I get it.

292
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:03,720
That's why you came to me.

293
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:06,123
We came to you because you have a truck.

294
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:07,924
And because you know
if anybody can navigate

295
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:11,195
the dark underworld of
the raw milk game, it's me.

296
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:13,230
You said it was a milk co-op.

297
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:16,036
Uh, it is, but these raw milk
guys can be loose cannons.

298
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:17,801
Just remember, if things go south,

299
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:19,135
there's a loaded BB gun in the back.

300
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,004
What is that?

301
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:22,806
Oh my God, it's the cops!

302
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:25,918
Don't stop! No, it's
nothing, it's probably an accident!

303
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:27,168
I'm gettin' out of here!

304
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:28,903
- Roland, Roland!
- Stop, it's so conspicuous!

305
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:30,043
- I know it's conspicuous!
- Close the door!

306
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:30,989
You're acting like I've
never done this before!

307
00:14:31,014 --> 00:14:32,886
Roland, just drive, just drive! Drive.

308
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:34,536
Okay, okay, okay, I'm driving.

309
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:35,504
Start driving, drive,
drive, drive! Okay?!

310
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:36,786
- Okay, I'm driving, I'm driving!
- Okay.

311
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:39,932
- A little quicker would be good!
- Yeah.

312
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:43,154
- I'm driving, I'm going!
- It's just a checkpoint, okay?

313
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:45,120
I've been through tons
of these in Johannesburg,

314
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:48,635
um, it's like a drive thru,
except everybody has a gun.

315
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:50,106
When were you in Johannesburg?!

316
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:52,743
I don't know, I remember I
just got my braces off, so...

317
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:55,011
You were 14, in South Africa?!

318
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:56,346
- Oh! Oh!
- Hey Johnny, Johnny, Johnny!

319
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,960
If this turns into a fire fight, um...

320
00:14:57,985 --> 00:14:59,519
you're my human shield,

321
00:14:59,543 --> 00:15:02,182
and we'll use her as a bargaining chip.

322
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:03,541
Yeah, okay, well,
that's not gonna happen.

323
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:05,176
Okay, I think the best thing to do

324
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:06,778
is just blow through the checkpoint.

325
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:09,097
Yeah, we're not blowing
through anything, Alexis!

326
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:13,817
So then my Uncle Ralph
marries his third wife.

327
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:15,754
What do you think her name was?

328
00:15:15,788 --> 00:15:17,355
- I don't know.
- Gayle!

329
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:19,356
The man marries three Gayles!

330
00:15:20,826 --> 00:15:22,693
Like didn't learn anything
from the first two!

331
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:24,328
I mean, what is that?!

332
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:27,365
Sorry I am late, gals,
it's just been a crazy day.

333
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,833
Wow, you look amazing!

334
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:32,236
Somebody went to the beauty salon!

335
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,005
Oh no, this is just a little refresh.

336
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,775
It's very... very glamorous.

337
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:40,945
So we've scrapped the whole
approachable angle, have we?

338
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,749
Who says this has anything to
do with the campaign, Moira?

339
00:15:44,783 --> 00:15:47,018
I love your top, where'd you get it?

340
00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:48,692
Oh, just a shop in Elmdale.

341
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:50,250
Colour me impressed.

342
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:53,572
It takes a real eye to
find something of quality

343
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:55,669
at a clothier in Elmdale.

344
00:15:55,695 --> 00:15:57,528
Oh no, just a little bit of luck,

345
00:15:57,562 --> 00:15:59,989
and the right... salesperson.

346
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:01,732
Any of that vodka left?

347
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:04,528
Oh yeah, Moira brought plenty.

348
00:16:07,725 --> 00:16:10,461
And here I thought you were
against this type of campaigning.

349
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:12,820
Who says this has anything
to do with the campaign?

350
00:16:20,753 --> 00:16:22,192
Just remember, no sudden movements,

351
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:23,411
do not reach for the glove box,

352
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:25,457
and not matter what happens do
not tell them your real name.

353
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:27,091
- Uh huh...
- What?!

354
00:16:28,936 --> 00:16:29,966
Turn off your truck, please.

355
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,957
Yes, sir.

356
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:34,770
Okay, who do we have here?

357
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:36,596
Oh, um...

358
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,188
that's uh, Jennifer.

359
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:41,616
And then he's um... Jacob.

360
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:43,509
And then I'm also Jacob.

361
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:47,678
Well, you can look at
our drivers' licences,

362
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:48,913
if you don't believe me!

363
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:51,278
Oh, I don't think that'll
be necessary, Jacob.

364
00:16:51,484 --> 00:16:53,418
Yeah, I'm just joking.

365
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:55,168
We don't have drivers' licences.

366
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:56,004
Um...

367
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:57,654
No, yeah, we do have driver's licenses,

368
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,923
we don't have those names
on our driver's license.

369
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:01,636
I'm gonna talk to someone else.

370
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:05,426
Jennifer? Actually, my
birth name is Angelica.

371
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,900
We're out here today
checking for illegal game.

372
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:10,372
Have you folks been hunting?

373
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:13,646
Hunting? No, no. We don't uh, hunt.

374
00:17:13,672 --> 00:17:17,008
I mean, there's n-no
hunting going on here.

375
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,609
No illegal... yeah,

376
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:21,679
you won't find any illegal
game here, that's for sure.

377
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:23,381
No!

378
00:17:23,415 --> 00:17:25,153
So, what do you have there in the back?

379
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,746
Um, actually, we're just
taking some milk to a co-op.

380
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,727
What kind of milk?

381
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,855
Cow milk.

382
00:17:31,356 --> 00:17:33,097
So you three are dairy farmers?

383
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:35,211
- Mhmm...
- Yes, yes, dairy farmers.

384
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:38,619
Hard work, hard work,
'Cause you get up you know,

385
00:17:38,644 --> 00:17:40,932
so early, but uh... But we love it.

386
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:44,044
- We do.
- You farm in that suit?

387
00:17:45,304 --> 00:17:46,911
When the weather's good.

388
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:49,535
I'm gonna need you to pull over, Jacob.

389
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:55,814
- Jacob?
- Jacob.

390
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:57,182
- Jacob?
- What?!

391
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:58,411
She wants you to pull over.

392
00:17:58,884 --> 00:18:00,285
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry, I
thought you were talking

393
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:02,487
to the other Jacob.

394
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:17,558
David? David, is that you?

395
00:18:21,695 --> 00:18:23,028
Yeah...

396
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:25,817
Will you come in here a minute, please?

397
00:18:29,986 --> 00:18:31,720
- Uh huh?
- You've had a long day.

398
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,445
Come sit.

399
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:36,520
Don't be such a prickly pear.

400
00:18:36,555 --> 00:18:39,324
I just wanna check in with my son.

401
00:18:39,357 --> 00:18:41,019
My first born.

402
00:18:41,393 --> 00:18:43,728
Mhmm...

403
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:47,332
So! You're enjoying
that new job of yours?

404
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:49,634
Um, it's a job.

405
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,472
So... sure.

406
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:54,338
I was wondering what kind
of customers do you get

407
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:56,090
at a store like that?

408
00:18:57,675 --> 00:18:58,977
Different kinds.

409
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,372
Different people come in.

410
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:02,680
Are they mostly locals from Elmdale,

411
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:06,230
or do people travel from far and wide

412
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:09,097
to benefit from the
expertise of a David Rose?

413
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:14,980
Okay, well if someone
is looking for my advice,

414
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:18,542
then I am more than happy to provide.

415
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:23,130
- I saw Jocelyn today.
- You did?

416
00:19:23,904 --> 00:19:27,040
Mhmm, she looked very different.

417
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,136
Mostly improved, though I must say,

418
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:32,916
I didn't like the matchy
matchy skirt and blazer!

419
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:35,012
No, she looked like an ageing stewardess

420
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:37,122
from a Latvian airline!

421
00:19:37,682 --> 00:19:39,317
I told her not to wear
the jacket with the skirt,

422
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:41,184
so... I don't know.

423
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,269
And whose idea was the hair thing?

424
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:47,950
I-I may have suggested...

425
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,961
a slightly more contemporary look.

426
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:53,664
I understand, I understand.
It's water under the bridge.

427
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:56,034
Well I'm sorry, I felt very...

428
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:57,468
conflicted about the whole thing.

429
00:19:57,502 --> 00:19:58,739
Of course you were.

430
00:19:59,672 --> 00:20:02,683
Now will you be a doll,
and fetch Mummy a knife?

431
00:20:03,972 --> 00:20:05,476
- A knife?
- Oh, I'm sorry,

432
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,239
I think you'll find one lodged
in the middle of my back.

433
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,965
Okay, well, that's a lot.

434
00:20:11,215 --> 00:20:12,650
And when you pull it out of my back...

435
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:14,184
Okay, I'm gonna take a shower.

436
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:16,220
... you can plunge it into my heart!

437
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,958
Okay, all right.

438
00:20:17,982 --> 00:20:21,786
Plunge it into my heart!

439
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:31,226
Thank you, Jacob.

440
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:32,980
Have a good day.

441
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:36,798
Well, there it goes.

442
00:20:36,832 --> 00:20:39,340
$400.00 worth of milk.

443
00:20:39,715 --> 00:20:41,568
I feel like this is partly my fault.

444
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:42,801
Partly?!

445
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,862
Roland was the one who
completely blew it back there!

446
00:20:45,886 --> 00:20:48,894
What?! Did you not
see me playing that cop?

447
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:50,902
Oh my God, she didn't
know which way was up

448
00:20:50,926 --> 00:20:52,333
when I was done with her!

449
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:54,761
The smell of this milk is
making me super nauseous.

450
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,799
Oh come on, guys, let's
not end on a down note here,

451
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,701
this was a good day,
let's end on an up note!

452
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:02,538
Enough Roland, just get the
cans in the truck, please.

453
00:21:02,571 --> 00:21:04,269
Oh, okay. I'll grab one.

454
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:05,884
Pick it up and put it on the truck!

455
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:06,972
Yes! Oh... okay.

456
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:09,310
Grab that one, put that on the truck,

457
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:11,547
and then I'll organize the
rest so you can grab 'em,

458
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,415
and put 'em on the truck.

460
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:18,753
Someone has to find

461
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:19,755
naked pictures of me.

462
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:21,123
Better you than a stranger

463
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,057
in a storm cellar.

464
00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:23,489
Nothing's coming up.

465
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:25,317
What search words did you use?

466
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:27,630
Your name and "nude."

467
00:21:27,632 --> 00:21:29,630
Three words I thought
I'd only have to type

468
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:31,847
if I was held at gunpoint.

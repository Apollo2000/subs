1
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,703
Someone keeps eating my yogurt!

2
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,151
- Arghhhh!
- What kind of yogurt?

3
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,487
I was saving that for after my run, David!

4
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,688
Oh my God, I guess I was saving it

5
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:25,057
for during your run, then.

6
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:27,259
Agh, you're like a big,
dirty raccoon, David!

7
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,061
Oh Alexis, you're almost forty,

8
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:31,835
if you want some food,
prepare yourself some food!

9
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:34,666
There is no food!

10
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,002
Nobody can cook, this
is basically child abuse!

11
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,813
David can cook.

12
00:00:39,225 --> 00:00:40,350
I can't cook.

13
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:43,875
You got that Teppanyaki
table for your bar mitzvah.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,554
That was thrown out after
Alexis left her extensions on it,

15
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,113
and everything smelled like burnt hair.

16
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:49,815
I thought it was an actual table, David.

17
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,950
There was a plug coming
out of the side of it!

18
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,819
Well, Alexis, why don't
you cook, you can cook.

19
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,854
- Yeah.
- I can't cook!

20
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,422
Why don't you cook?

21
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,157
Well, I-I could...
I-I could cook.

22
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,560
Oh, John, John! This is embarrassing!

23
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,889
Fine, I'll cook dinner tonight.

24
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,255
What was the chicken dish
that Adelina used to make?

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,607
Mm! The enchiladas.

26
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:12,999
- Yeah!
- Uh huh.

27
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:15,616
Oh, Adelina, she was a good cook, remember?

28
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:16,749
Mm! Uh huh! Yeah! Mmm!

29
00:01:16,774 --> 00:01:19,858
Excuse me, but the enchiladas
were my mother's recipe.

30
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:22,418
I don't think so.

31
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:24,277
Um, that's not how I remember it.

32
00:01:24,302 --> 00:01:26,077
I made it for you all the time!

33
00:01:27,456 --> 00:01:29,491
- John?!
- Yes, well,

34
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:31,296
if that's the way you remember
things, sweetheart, that's...

35
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:34,803
Okay, enough, tonight I will
make my mother's enchiladas.

36
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,476
And David, you will help me.

37
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:37,788
Uh, what?!

38
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:40,819
Oh my gosh David, it's gonna be so fun

39
00:01:40,844 --> 00:01:42,881
- for you tonight, doing that with Mom.
- Don't touch me!

40
00:01:42,906 --> 00:01:44,428
- It's so nice!
- Don't! That's harassment!

41
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:51,280
-- Synced by the_foe --
-- (dla Misi) --

42
00:02:04,117 --> 00:02:05,850
Well, there she is!

43
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,053
- Hi.
- How are you today, Jocelyn?

44
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:10,483
Oh, I'm okay, busy, I mean, we were about

45
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:12,743
- to head to, um...
- How fun.

46
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:15,405
Listen, a small favour...

47
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:18,272
I require the use of your kitchen.

48
00:02:19,632 --> 00:02:21,399
Sorry, for what?

49
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:23,077
To cook a meal, of course.

50
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,735
Oh Moira, normally I'd be happy to,

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,528
it's just we have a really
hectic afternoon, so...

52
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:30,139
David and I are going to resurrect

53
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:32,265
an old family recipe.

54
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,952
Mmm!

55
00:02:34,257 --> 00:02:36,936
Of course I'd say... yes,

56
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:40,135
it's just that that darn
stove is on the fritz.

57
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:41,936
Oh really, honey?

58
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:43,879
Because this pie is scorching!

59
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:46,053
It comes and goes, Roland!

60
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:48,346
Oh, I'm sure it's far superior
to what we have at the motel.

61
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:50,006
David and I will manage!

62
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:52,827
Oh, I know, it's-it's just
that I called the repairman,

63
00:02:52,852 --> 00:02:54,616
and so he's coming this afternoon.

64
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,639
- Oh.
- Who'd you call, honey? Bill?

65
00:02:56,667 --> 00:03:00,460
- Yeah... Bill.
- Bill doesn't do stoves.

66
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,782
Then, Gary.

67
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:04,655
Gary? Our dentist??

68
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,733
I don't remember who I called but,

69
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:10,280
they're coming, this afternoon!

70
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:11,678
Oh.

71
00:03:12,252 --> 00:03:14,152
It's as if you don't trust David and me

72
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:16,483
to fend for ourselves in your kitchen.

73
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:19,654
Oh no, we don't mind you using our kitchen,

74
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:21,880
as long as you make extra for us,

75
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:24,538
and leave a ten spot
over there for the hydro.

76
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,609
That I can do! I'll be back in ten,

77
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:27,874
to a clean kitchen!

78
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:30,577
- A clean kitchen.
- I just cleaned the kitchen!

79
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:33,281
How's the brisket, Mr. Rose?

80
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:35,381
Well, it's tasting more like meat.

81
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:37,077
Oh, well that's good!

82
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:39,131
You know Twyla, I've
been noticing how quiet

83
00:03:39,156 --> 00:03:40,546
it is in here during the day.

84
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,194
Oh yeah, it's always quiet
before the lunch rush.

85
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,954
Which isn't so much a rush
as much as it is just a...

86
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:48,247
A handful of people showing
up at a leisurely pace.

87
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:51,245
Oh, yeah, well, the reason I point it out

88
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,014
is that um, you know, I've been
looking for a place to work.

89
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,006
- Like a-an office
space. - Uh-huh.

90
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:58,457
You see, I get a lot of
ideas back at the motel

91
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:01,061
that need serious contemplation,

92
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:02,789
but with the family there,

93
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:04,436
I just can't seem to get any work done.

94
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:07,491
- I hear that.
- So, I was wondering...

95
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:09,450
And I thought about bringing
this up the other day,

96
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:11,910
but decided against it, for some reason.

97
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:13,928
But here we are talking, so, what the hell.

98
00:04:14,274 --> 00:04:16,008
What are the chances of me operating

99
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,928
out of one of these booths every day?

100
00:04:19,077 --> 00:04:20,927
I am just gonna put these plates down.

101
00:04:20,952 --> 00:04:22,752
I just think I'll think better,

102
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:25,178
once the blood rushes from
my arms, back to my head.

103
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:27,738
Oh, oh! Yes, yes, yes! Uh, absolutely!

104
00:04:27,763 --> 00:04:29,597
Yeah, you can put them down, I
didn't mean to keep you, there.

105
00:04:29,622 --> 00:04:30,689
I know you've got a lot of work to do.

106
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:31,835
Totally, they're just heavy plates!

107
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,594
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. Okay.

108
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,452
Hey there, Johnny.

109
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:39,896
Oh, Bob, hi! Oh, I didn't see you there.

110
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:42,053
I hope you don't mind me uh,

111
00:04:42,078 --> 00:04:44,512
eavesdropping on your conversation, but uh,

112
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:47,358
I think maybe I could help you.

113
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:51,375
- Really?
- I heard you're looking for office space?

114
00:04:51,815 --> 00:04:54,384
- Yes!
- Well, I have a sweet little spot

115
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:56,577
you might be interested in, if uh,

116
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:58,212
if you wanna take a look.

117
00:04:58,285 --> 00:05:00,046
Yes, I would! Thank you.

118
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:03,077
Happy to help, I'm sure
you'd do the same for me.

119
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:05,466
If you had anything to offer.

120
00:05:17,308 --> 00:05:19,413
- Hi.
- Hi.

121
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:24,452
Is this a safe space yet, for us? Or...

122
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,936
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

123
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:29,021
Oh, okay, it's just 'cause
the last time I was in here,

124
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:30,467
you told me to leave your office,

125
00:05:30,492 --> 00:05:32,589
so, I guess I was just having a hard time

126
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,311
gauging where we're at,

127
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:40,921
as two people who used
to um... be well, um...

128
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:44,171
How can I help you?

129
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:47,249
I-I'm wondering if I
can borrow your vehicle?

130
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:49,546
I need to get some groceries.

131
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:54,092
Sure. Do you want a lift?

132
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:57,250
Is that a trick question?

133
00:05:57,275 --> 00:06:00,249
- No.
- Oh, okay.

134
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:01,514
Um...

135
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:02,939
You don't have to keep tiptoeing around me.

136
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:05,296
- I'm over it.
- Over it?

137
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,344
Yeah, I don't like you anymore.

138
00:06:07,394 --> 00:06:08,828
I mean, like that.

139
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:11,585
Oh! Okay.

140
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,756
Well, that's good then, I guess.

141
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,022
I think so.

142
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:19,311
- Are you wearing makeup?
- So what if I am?

143
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:36,514
Hey! Uh, I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

144
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,941
Uh no, no, of course not.

145
00:06:39,076 --> 00:06:41,022
Okay. Um...

146
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:43,715
So I've been thinking a lot about things.

147
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:45,717
Okay, good, because I've been thinking

148
00:06:45,742 --> 00:06:46,921
a lot about things, too.

149
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:49,827
- Like your proposal.
- Yeah, the more I thought about it,

150
00:06:49,852 --> 00:06:52,320
the more it just didn't feel right.

151
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:54,866
Yes! I agree!

152
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:55,983
Yeah, it came out of the blue,

153
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:58,441
and you had a lot on your mind.

154
00:06:58,476 --> 00:07:00,288
Yes, Ted, yes!

155
00:07:00,491 --> 00:07:04,069
So I think it may be best for us just to...

156
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:06,028
Take some time, you know?

157
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:08,587
Oh my God, it's like we're sharing a brain!

158
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:10,279
Then in a few weeks, when we're settled,

159
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,638
and more focused on each other,

160
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:14,139
we try the whole proposal thing again.

161
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:17,272
Hmm?

162
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:21,303
Mmm-hmm...

163
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:23,629
Unless you were gonna say something else?

164
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:29,608
No!

165
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,389
'Cause you and me...

166
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,181
You and I...

167
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,673
No, uh-huh,
uh-huh, uh-huh!

168
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:40,678
It's-mmm!

169
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:44,830
So uh-us, the "us" thing,

170
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:47,811
and... Um...

171
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:51,296
Whoa!

172
00:07:55,693 --> 00:07:58,030
So uh, what do you think, Johnny?

173
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,911
What do I think? I
think it's a nice garage.

174
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:03,350
- Where's the office?
- You're looking at it.

175
00:08:03,603 --> 00:08:06,204
Bob, you told me you had a
sweet little office space,

176
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:08,421
okay, and frankly, working out of a garage

177
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,874
is not what I had in mind.

178
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:11,712
Well uh, out of curiosity,

179
00:08:11,737 --> 00:08:13,631
what did you have in mind?

180
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:17,110
An office! You know, a chair, for starters!

181
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:20,991
Oh, well, we got a uh, I got a
great spot for a chair right there,

182
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:24,147
uh, you just have to move these tires.

183
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,673
Um, filing those papers'll
give you some extra space.

184
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:28,248
Yeah, Bob, I'm not working for you,

185
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:30,171
I'm not filing papers.

186
00:08:30,196 --> 00:08:32,598
No, I'm just saying, if you
need to get a chair in here,

187
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:34,224
you know, you might
have to move some things,

188
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:37,685
maybe, you know, sell some old car parts.

189
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:39,975
Yeah, I didn't come here looking for a job.

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,272
Okay? I wanted a space
to work, and frankly...

191
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:43,663
I don't think this is it.

192
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,491
Okay, well uh,

193
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:48,053
I'm not saying you have to
make a decision right now,

194
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:51,389
just maybe clean it
up, and give it a think.

195
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:53,883
How about I give it a think
without cleaning it up!

196
00:08:54,362 --> 00:08:55,600
Suit yourself.

197
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,658
As long as it gets
cleaned up at some point.

198
00:08:57,683 --> 00:08:58,434
Okay, Bob...

199
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,709
Uh, I'm gonna leave you with your thoughts.

200
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:17,764
- Hey!
- What's up?

201
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:22,850
Mm, uh well, good news, I um...

202
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:24,721
I finally went over to break up with Ted.

203
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:26,489
Ooh, that is good!

204
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,657
I was starting to think
you might never do it.

205
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:30,026
I know, I know.

206
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,803
It must've been hard.

207
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:34,029
It was, it was really hard.

208
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:35,858
How'd he take it?

209
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:38,310
Um, I don't know, you never
know with these things.

210
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:39,960
So... ooh!

211
00:09:39,985 --> 00:09:42,953
- Alexis?
- What's up?

212
00:09:42,978 --> 00:09:45,146
You didn't break up with Ted, did you?

213
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:49,585
Um, well, like I said,
I started to, and then,

214
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,245
I don't know if it was
the timbre of his voice,

215
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,255
or the fact that he
smelled like baby powder,

216
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,896
but I just, I physically couldn't do it!

217
00:09:56,921 --> 00:10:00,223
- Okay.
- Yeah.

218
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:02,325
You know, there was... It
must happen to people, right?

219
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,427
Like, there must be people
out there who say yes

220
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:05,895
to getting married
because they can't say no,

221
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,077
and then what happens?

222
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:09,850
And then they're just stuck
for the rest of their life,

223
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,663
with the same wrong, sweet, person, right?

224
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:16,657
Well, I'm pretty sure
those people get divorced.

225
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:18,264
Aaah!

226
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:21,647
Alexis, you need to be honest with him.

227
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:25,764
Okay.

228
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:31,647
What if I sent him the
sweetest little text message?

229
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:36,663
Okay. Yeah.

230
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,234
I'll do it in person.

231
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:40,960
Obviously, I'm just...

232
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:42,919
I'm gonna do it in person.

233
00:10:42,944 --> 00:10:44,725
I will do this in person!

234
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:48,835
Well, that was quick.

235
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,108
It was a pretty short grocery list.

236
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:54,749
No, I mean, you being "over it."

237
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:57,336
I knew what you meant.

238
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:58,962
It's just a really fast turnaround.

239
00:10:58,987 --> 00:11:01,122
You know, usually it
doesn't happen that quickly.

240
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:02,702
What if it does?

241
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,663
Well, it's just when
someone keeps telling you

242
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:06,322
that they're over it, sometimes it means

243
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:09,217
that they're not actually
over it, which is fine!

244
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:11,243
But it's fine too if they are over it.

245
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:13,210
Yeah, I just wanna make sure
that you're taking the time

246
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:15,764
to actually get over it, you know,

247
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:17,923
because if you don't, I
think it could lead to just...

248
00:11:17,948 --> 00:11:19,445
You know, it's interesting,

249
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,770
the longer we have this conversation,

250
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:22,702
the more over it I get.

251
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:24,161
- Oh!
- In fact, I'm having a hard time

252
00:11:24,186 --> 00:11:25,987
remembering when I wasn't over it.

253
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,630
Wow, well aren't you just a...

254
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,689
A pillar of strength, and self-healing.

255
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:32,889
Yeah, I'm pretty amazing.

256
00:11:32,914 --> 00:11:34,748
- Uh huh.
- You really missed out.

257
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:37,542
- Oh, did I?
- 'Cause, you know,

258
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,201
- I'm over it.
- You're over it! Yep.

259
00:11:39,226 --> 00:11:41,702
Yeah, you made that abundantly clear. So...

260
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:47,689
Okay, a quarter cup at a time.

261
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,457
A thin stream, it's
supposed to be a thin stream,

262
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:51,059
- and blend it really well.
- Uh huh. Uh huh.

263
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:53,054
Or you'll burn it...
David, that's not right!

264
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,312
Okay well, that's because
I'm ladling and stirring

265
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,114
at the same time, and
you're just standing there.

266
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,248
Now is not the time to lose focus, darling.

267
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,117
This was your idea!

268
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,210
You're the one who allegedly
made the enchiladas.

269
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:03,036
Yes, so try to keep up.

270
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,883
Okay, next.

271
00:12:04,908 --> 00:12:07,277
Now's the time to sprinkle
in the chili pepper flakes.

272
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:09,133
We've already done that.

273
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:11,211
What number are we on?!

274
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:13,489
Oh my God, is this not
your mother's recipe?

275
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:15,256
Yes, and now I'm passing it on to you!

276
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:16,516
So try to keep up.

277
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:18,235
Um... oh!

278
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,141
Next step is to fold in the cheese.

279
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:24,781
What does that mean?

280
00:12:24,806 --> 00:12:26,578
What does "fold in the cheese" mean?

281
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:30,034
- You fold it in.
- I understand that, but how?

282
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:31,926
How do you fold it? Do you fold it in half,

283
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,663
like a piece of paper,
and drop it in the pot,

284
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:34,901
or, what do you do?

285
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:37,037
David, I cannot show you everything.

286
00:12:37,071 --> 00:12:38,828
Okay, well, can you show me one thing?!

287
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:42,084
You just... here's what you do:

288
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:43,844
You just fold it in.

289
00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:46,471
Okay, I don't know how to
fold broken cheese like that!

290
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:48,364
Then I don't know how to be any clearer!

291
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:49,756
You take that thing that's in your hand,

292
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:50,948
- Uh huh?
- And you...

293
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:53,162
If you say "fold in" one more time...

294
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:55,008
It says, fold it in!

295
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,257
This is your recipe!

296
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,125
You fold in the cheese, then!

297
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,787
- Don't you dare!
- You fold it in!

298
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:01,727
David!

299
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:05,492
Oh good, now I see bubbles.

300
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:09,491
David! What does burning smell like?!

301
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:14,039
All right, here we go. Ohhh!

302
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:17,039
Hey.

303
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,906
Wow, twice in the same day,
what'd I do to deserve this?

304
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,466
Um, I was hoping we could talk again.

305
00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:25,227
Oh, well, I was about to
give Hazel a blood test.

306
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:27,516
Well, I think it's probably
better if you put Hazel down.

307
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,656
What?! No, she'll be fine!

308
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,324
- It's just her blood sugar!
- No, no, no, no, no!

309
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:32,392
I just mean while we talk,
I think it would be...

310
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:34,094
Um, easier.

311
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:36,963
Oh, okay.

312
00:13:36,998 --> 00:13:39,633
There we go.

313
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,133
Okay.

314
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:44,844
So, I did something.

315
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:48,375
I didn't do something, I
should've done something.

316
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:50,024
And I didn't.

317
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:51,985
What didn't you do?

318
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,250
Um, I wasn't direct with people.

319
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:58,461
People who deserve more directness.

320
00:13:58,992 --> 00:14:01,321
People like you.

321
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:04,469
Well, that was pretty direct.

322
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:07,235
People like you deserve
better than people like me.

323
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:10,008
You're the perfect boyfriend, Ted.

324
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,074
- Thank you...
- But...

325
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:13,466
I knew there was a "but."

326
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:15,656
No, no, no! There is no "but."

327
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:19,883
But you're just not the
perfect boyfriend for me.

328
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:23,570
And I don't-i don't think
that I'm in this enough

329
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:25,229
to take it to the next level.

330
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:28,949
Okay.

331
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:30,383
Okay.

332
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:32,434
So that does mean that I don't think

333
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:35,367
that I can accept, your proposal.

334
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:37,157
Yeah, no, I pieced that part together.

335
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:38,578
Okay.

336
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,428
But um...

337
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,945
Thank you.

338
00:14:44,904 --> 00:14:48,244
- For what?
- Well, I wouldn't want to marry someone

339
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,737
who didn't feel about me

340
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:52,297
the same way that I feel about them.

341
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:56,269
Oh wow, could you make this any harder?

342
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:59,038
Well, I did book us a
two week couples vacation

343
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:00,590
that's non-refundable.

344
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:02,949
Ooh, yeah, that makes...

345
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:04,633
That makes it harder.

346
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:10,991
Hi Bob, what's uh, going on?

347
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:12,656
Johnny, what are you doing here?

348
00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:15,985
Well, I just came by to talk
to you about the office space.

349
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:18,198
It's funny to hear that,

350
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:21,468
because before you were
saying this isn't office space.

351
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:23,370
And uh, well, I got to thinking,

352
00:15:23,404 --> 00:15:25,538
well, if it's not office space,

353
00:15:25,573 --> 00:15:28,789
then, what the heck is it?!

354
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:31,082
And then I remembered
Gwen's nephew, Eric, here,

355
00:15:31,107 --> 00:15:33,741
was looking for studio space.

356
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:37,344
Uh, he draws Chinese cartoons.

357
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,671
They're Japanese graphic novels.

358
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:41,828
It's called Manga.

359
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:43,693
Oh, well, that sounds like a...

360
00:15:43,718 --> 00:15:45,750
Lucrative career choice.

361
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:48,662
So anyway Bob, I've
decided to take this space

362
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:50,617
for my office, so.

363
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,433
Ooh, now this is a bit awkward,

364
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:56,036
because you gave me the distinct impression

365
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,063
that you didn't want it.

366
00:15:58,264 --> 00:16:01,232
And now we uh, have Eric here.

367
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:03,425
Yeah, well, Eric can find a you know,

368
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,252
a back room, or a dark
basement to doodle in.

369
00:16:06,547 --> 00:16:08,748
Well, that's okay, Uncle Bob.

370
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:10,281
I don't have any money.

371
00:16:10,306 --> 00:16:13,175
Either does Johnny, and
he's not even related to me.

372
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,269
No, but you said Eric was Gwen's nephew,

373
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:19,639
so technically he's not
related to you, either.

374
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:20,994
So... no offense, Eric.

375
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:22,774
No, that's fair.

376
00:16:23,164 --> 00:16:25,065
Oh. Well, uh...

377
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:27,701
All right, Johnny, uh,
I guess just let me know

378
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:29,836
when you've finished cleaning up,

379
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,477
and uh, I'll find something
else for you to do.

380
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:36,410
Bob, I don't work for
you, I'm just setting up an office!

381
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:38,236
No, I know, it's your space.

382
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:41,397
And uh, just so you know,
garage opens at eight,

383
00:16:41,422 --> 00:16:44,824
but if you're here a few
minutes before that, even better!

384
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,178
How did it go?

385
00:17:02,203 --> 00:17:04,070
You smell the room, what do you think?

386
00:17:04,504 --> 00:17:06,171
I-I don't know.

387
00:17:06,206 --> 00:17:07,577
Well, of course you don't,

388
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:10,960
because I have not taught
you life's basic skills.

389
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:14,381
Other than cooking, what
basic life skills don't I have?

390
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:17,242
Oh David, I'm not sure
we have time for that.

391
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:18,367
You know, when I was a young girl,

392
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:21,196
my sister and I baked bread from scratch,

393
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:23,555
in a kitchen half this size.

394
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,850
Do I wanna hear this story?

395
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,260
I could make a bed, I
could fix a wobbly table,

396
00:17:28,294 --> 00:17:30,686
or start a car without a key.

397
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,561
Then I met your father,

398
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:36,322
and suddenly I had people
to do everything for me.

399
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:40,420
And I assumed that I would
maintain my proficiencies,

400
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:43,100
should I ever, God forbid, need them.

401
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:47,264
But no, I have lost all my skills.

402
00:17:47,763 --> 00:17:51,198
And now I know how it feels
to be utterly helpless,

403
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,764
like you, and your sister.

404
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:56,506
I don't know if I'd call us "helpless."

405
00:17:56,531 --> 00:17:58,186
No need to make me feel better.

406
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:03,241
Anyway, I um... I found something.

407
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:06,405
David, that's your cell phone!

408
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:11,936
Um... you might wanna
press play on my cell phone.

409
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,608
Just press...

410
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,552
"Folding" is one of the easiest
techniques in the book.

411
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:20,855
It's just a very gentle way
of combining two ingredients.

412
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,592
See what I'm doing?

413
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,901
Well, that's simple enough,
any fool could do that.

414
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,952
- Did you do that?!
- No.

415
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:31,170
Folding is most often used in baking...

416
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:37,044
- Oh, Mr. Rose.
- Oh, hi there, Ted.

417
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:39,004
I was just dropping off
some stuff for Alexis.

418
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:41,898
Oh. You wanna come in?

419
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,845
Uh, I think it's best if I don't.

420
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,835
Oh.

421
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,127
- Oh...
- Yeah.

422
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:49,702
We broke up.

423
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:52,287
Yeah, I... I'm sorry to hear that.

424
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:54,311
Yeah, me too.

425
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:56,848
Are you okay?

426
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:58,928
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

427
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:00,756
Good.

428
00:19:05,534 --> 00:19:08,889
Okay, that's okay.

429
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,115
I'm sorry, it's just...

430
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:13,780
She really made a mark on me, you know?

431
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:19,655
And it's rare to find someone
that beautiful, and smart,

432
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,514
and deeply selfish, yet charming!

433
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:27,121
Yeah, I know, I know.
Well, you'll bounce back,

434
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:30,082
you'll bounce back because
you're a fine young man.

435
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:32,256
You're a fine young man, and...

436
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:34,866
Yeah, yeah. I think I just...

437
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:38,358
Need to get away for a little while.

438
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:39,960
You know, clear my head a bit.

439
00:19:39,985 --> 00:19:43,491
Yeah, well, that looks like
that might be a good idea.

440
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,833
Well, this looks delicious!

441
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:57,802
I see someone decided on a new dish.

442
00:19:57,837 --> 00:20:00,452
Nope, these are the enchiladas.

443
00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:02,278
Yeah well, they kinda
smell like enchiladas, so...

444
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:04,525
We had lots of fun making them.

445
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,224
Mm! Let's not ruin a meal
by talking about the process!

446
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:08,678
Well, fair enough.

447
00:20:08,703 --> 00:20:12,241
Hey, I for one, cannot wait to dig in!

448
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:13,852
Hmm!

449
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,358
Mmm!

450
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:46,724
Not bad. Not bad, you two!

451
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:47,967
Not bad at all!

452
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:58,874
Mm... it's creamy.

453
00:20:58,998 --> 00:21:00,198
- Very creamy.
- Mm!

454
00:21:00,232 --> 00:21:01,299
Thank you, Alexis.

455
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:05,415
Well, this could be a very good thing!

456
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,241
I think maybe once, or twice a week...

457
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,232
This won't be happening again.

458
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:09,662
Uh-uh.

459
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:12,077
Although it's really not that complicated,

460
00:21:12,111 --> 00:21:16,835
- once you fold in the cheese!
- Ahh...

461
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,967

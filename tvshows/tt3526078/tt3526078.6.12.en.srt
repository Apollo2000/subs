1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,952
8:15. Roland still
isn't here yet.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,599
You know if we're a half hour
late for this pitch meeting

3
00:00:06,684 --> 00:00:08,172
we'll be laughed
out of the room.

4
00:00:08,257 --> 00:00:09,776
Mr. Rose,
you're stressing me out.

5
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:11,747
And I just chugged
a bottle of CBD oil.

6
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:14,439
Patrick and I will need to
get to the store at some point.

7
00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:16,184
David,
your father and Stevie

8
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:18,042
can use all the help
they could get.

9
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:19,878
- Help?
- I said support, dear.

10
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:21,432
Listen, I think it's
a very good sign,

11
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:23,564
- that they've sent a jet.
- There is a jet?

12
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:24,776
- Can I come?
- I already asked.

13
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,983
I'll swap out
with someone.

14
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,719
Stevie, you're gonna
be great.

15
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:29,855
Okay. Here we go.

16
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,262
Here we go.
Stevie, let's move.

17
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:33,541
Okay, Stevie.

18
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:36,122
Make sure they feed him lots
of booze on the fight.

19
00:00:36,207 --> 00:00:39,842
Johnny, woo!
Look at me. I'm you.

20
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,488
I can't believe
your suit fits me,

21
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:45,136
we're completely
different sizes.

22
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,205
And I have a much more
athletic build.

23
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:50,893
He looks the same age
as the day I met him.

24
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:54,101
Oh, I'm sure he's just as
handsome as he's ever been.

25
00:00:54,308 --> 00:00:56,851
Boys, this time tomorrow
your store

26
00:00:56,943 --> 00:01:00,193
may be the official supplier
of Rosebud Motels

27
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:01,736
across the continent.

28
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:04,016
I have nothing
but confidence, Mr. Rose.

29
00:01:04,254 --> 00:01:06,069
Rollie, there's mints
in your pocket,

30
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:08,230
there was a lot of onions
in the omelette.

31
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:10,162
Goodbye, my conquistadors!

32
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:11,763
We are all relying on you...

33
00:01:11,847 --> 00:01:13,376
No! We're cheering you on!

34
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:15,569
- Just wave. Just wave.
- All right.

35
00:01:16,682 --> 00:01:17,882
- Yay!
- Woo!

36
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:21,932
Woo! Woo!

00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:45,830
Can we maybe stop
with the drum circle?

42
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,135
Just-I'm just not feeling great.

43
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:51,306
Are private planes
always that bumpy?

44
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:54,999
Sorry, Stevie, just a bit
anxious to get this started.

45
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:57,057
I believe in this team.

46
00:01:57,293 --> 00:02:00,531
And we have an idea here that
could be a nice little Jewel

47
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:03,512
in the advantage capitol
association portfolio.

48
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:05,450
- Agree?
- Agree.

49
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,933
Sure.

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,055
Mr. Rose. Ruth Clancy.
I'm Mike Morrison's assistant.

51
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,424
It's an honour to meet you.

52
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,812
Well, hi Ruth,
just call me Johnny.

53
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:17,918
Uh, do you know if there
is water where we're going?

54
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:21,563
'Cause I just got a sudden
case of dry mouth.

55
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:24,101
There's water waiting for you
in the boardroom.

56
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:24,948
Right.

57
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:26,982
Johnny, Mike has been
singing your praises

58
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:28,786
ever since you reached out
to him.

59
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:30,766
He's devastated he couldn't be
here for the meeting.

60
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,871
What?

61
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:34,578
Yeah, unfortunately, he had
to board a flight last night

62
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:37,182
to Johannesburg,
but he sends his best.

63
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,785
Um, we can always wait
'til he gets back.

64
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,148
He's there for a week.

65
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:43,524
On a personal note,

66
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:45,932
my parents used to take me
to Rose video

67
00:02:46,017 --> 00:02:47,805
- all the time when I was a kid.
- Oh.

68
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51,644
I always loved the free
popcorn. Nice touch.

69
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:54,465
Well, thank you, Ruth.
It's always important

70
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,498
to make the experience
more personalized.

71
00:02:57,657 --> 00:02:59,336
I couldn't agree more.

72
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,207
- Hi. Ruth.
- Stevie.

73
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,942
I like your offices.

74
00:03:04,347 --> 00:03:06,897
- Office.
- Thank you.

75
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:09,520
Right this way. I'll show you
to the boardroom.

76
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:11,936
- Okay.
- Hey does anybody want a mint

77
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:13,564
before we go up
to the boardroom?

78
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:15,153
I'm looking at you, Johnny.

79
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,275
- I'm good, Roland.
- Uh...

80
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:19,940
There you go.

81
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,062
Um... what are you doing?

82
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:29,198
Oh, just some light
reorganization.

83
00:03:29,283 --> 00:03:31,134
Okay, because it looks
like you're packing.

84
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:33,721
You see a few cherished items
being neatly folded

85
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:35,204
into a piece of luggage

86
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:37,241
and you immediately leap
to conclusions.

87
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,994
So you're not packing then.

88
00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:40,756
It's just a precaution.

89
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:43,342
God forbid I find myself
once again

90
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:44,700
being forcefully evacuated

91
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,835
and given no time
to do a thorough sweep.

92
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:49,281
Who will be forcefully
evacuating you?

93
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:51,436
I will, if your father
gets the green light.

94
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:53,506
And where will you be
forcefully evacuated?

95
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,040
Well, the offices
are in New York,

96
00:03:55,124 --> 00:03:56,519
so one can only presume.

97
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:58,091
- You're moving to New York?
- Hm.

98
00:03:58,176 --> 00:04:00,095
When were you gonna tell me?
Or you're just gonna like

99
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:01,565
up and leave in the middle
of the night.

100
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:04,265
Alexis, neurosis is not
becoming on a young woman.

101
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:05,878
Well, what are we supposed
to do?

102
00:04:05,963 --> 00:04:07,814
You just going like abandon
us here?

103
00:04:08,142 --> 00:04:11,390
Alexis, let's not count our
poultry before it's incubated,

104
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:13,070
and depending on
what we acquire,

105
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:16,194
we might not even have
a guest room available.

106
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:19,264
Okay. Well, either way,
the interflix offices are there

107
00:04:19,348 --> 00:04:21,066
and they told me that they
wanted to talk to me

108
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,872
about continuing
our relationship.

109
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:24,869
Felicitations, Alexis.

110
00:04:24,953 --> 00:04:26,939
Okay, I know this technically
isn't news yet,

111
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:29,506
but like...
This is really good news.

112
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:41,623
Hi.

113
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:43,140
- What are you doing?
- Working.

114
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:45,512
- What are you doing?
- Um, I'm on a break.

115
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:46,785
What are you actually
doing?

116
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,383
I am looking up apartment
rentals in New York.

117
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,529
What are you actually
doing?

118
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:52,228
I forgot my wallet
and keys and phone. Wait.

119
00:04:52,312 --> 00:04:53,763
Why-why are you doing that?

120
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:55,896
Um, apparently when dad signs
the deal,

121
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:57,765
we are moving
to New York.

122
00:04:58,551 --> 00:05:01,164
What? Well,
who's moving to New York?

123
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:02,746
Mom and dad. And me.

124
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:04,907
And nobody thought to include
me in this plan?

125
00:05:04,992 --> 00:05:07,856
I literally just found out,
and I'm telling you right now.

126
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,907
Okay. Well, this might be
a stupid question,

127
00:05:09,992 --> 00:05:11,850
but what if the deal
doesn't go through?

128
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:13,765
Okay. You would have no way
of knowing this,

129
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:15,890
but usually when someone
sends a jet for you,

130
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:18,123
it means he's very interested.
Trust me.

131
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,692
And Tiger Woods.

132
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:21,860
Okay. Also, and don't worry.

133
00:05:21,944 --> 00:05:23,618
I knew you'd get all panic-y
and weird about this,

134
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:26,530
so I'm looking for a two
bedroom. You're welcome.

135
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:28,400
Okay. What if my husband
and I

136
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:30,045
don't wanna share
an apartment with you?

137
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:32,635
Oh, David, you try finding
an affordable one-bedroom

138
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,406
in a place that's
not Atlantic city.

139
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:36,274
This is a lot of information
to process

140
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,371
on a Tuesday morning.

141
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:39,934
Like, I'm gonna have to talk
to Patrick about this.

142
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:41,804
And, what,
we move our business?

143
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:43,624
I mean, New York would be
a good market for it.

144
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,428
Especially if we start supplying
all those other motels.

145
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:48,080
Oh my god, David,
look at this one.

146
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:49,463
It overlooks a park.

147
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:51,266
I would have my own bathroom.

148
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:52,840
And oh my god,
your bedroom would have

149
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:54,909
one of those little beds that
comes down from the wall.

150
00:05:54,993 --> 00:05:56,343
Okay, we're two people.

151
00:05:56,428 --> 00:05:57,361
We would get
the master bedroom.

152
00:05:57,446 --> 00:06:00,171
- But I have a lot of coats.
- I have been looking forward

153
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:02,433
to seeing kerry Washington
in that all-female revival

154
00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:04,311
- of "12 angry men."
- Okay, David,

155
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:06,469
I'm gonna have to like bring
down to earth for a sec.

156
00:06:06,553 --> 00:06:08,405
There is no way you're getting
tickets for that show.

157
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:09,802
But I love your enthusiasm.

158
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:12,488
Okay. I have to go back
to work.

159
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,489
So why don't I just talk
to Patrick,

160
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,261
and then we should all regroup
at some point

161
00:06:16,345 --> 00:06:18,288
because there is a lot
of what ifs to go through.

162
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:20,909
Like what if we don't agree
on apartment decor,

163
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:22,409
or candle fragrance, etc.

164
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:23,960
Totally.

165
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:27,601
I don't wanna get too excited
about this,

166
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,086
but I will be putting
our names down

167
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,585
for that ticket lottery
to see kerry

168
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,167
because Elle fanning is
supposed to be incredible

169
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:34,770
as the foreman.

170
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:37,197
- Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
- Oh my god.

171
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:41,844
This is Mr. Rose
and associates.

172
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:43,392
The floor is yours.

173
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:45,291
Well, good afternoon,
everyone.

174
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:47,227
I'd like to say,
long time no see,

175
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:50,700
but Mike's not here
and we've just met.

176
00:06:52,232 --> 00:06:53,507
Well, it's good
to have you here.

177
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:55,826
I'm Bryce Wilson, this is my
partner, Tripp Campbell.

178
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:57,837
Say hello
to advantage capital.

179
00:06:57,922 --> 00:06:59,573
- Oh hi.
- Oh hi.

180
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,698
Hope the jet was
Johnny Rose approved.

181
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:02,766
Oh.

182
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:03,956
Although I guess at this
point,

183
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,025
coach would be Johnny Rose
approved?

184
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,727
Quite the tumble you took
there, Johnny.

185
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:13,472
Could have happened
to any one of us.

186
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:16,708
But thank you
for flying us in today.

187
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,644
- Yeah, that was Mike's idea.
- Hm.

188
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:21,446
Think he felt bad 'cause he
wasn't gonna be here, you know?

189
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,281
Maybe we should get things
moving?

190
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:25,754
Hi.
Spoken like a true C.O.O.

191
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,425
Now, I'd like to introduce
you to my team.

192
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,562
This is Stevie Budd
and Roland Schitt,

193
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:33,899
and together we are
Rosebud Motel Group.

194
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:36,846
Look, we read the information
packet you sent through.

195
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:39,661
Buying up local motels,
dusting them off,

196
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:42,440
and selling it as a boutique
experience. Right?

197
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:43,669
That's correct.

198
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:46,470
So Stevie how do you feel
about walking us

199
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:47,913
through the projections?

200
00:07:48,055 --> 00:07:51,337
Okay. So...

201
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:55,010
You might be thinking
to yourself

202
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:58,284
these motels are small,
how and why should I...

203
00:07:58,369 --> 00:07:59,624
We invest?

204
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,427
Well, that's a good question.

205
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:03,851
I should hope so.
It's why we're all here.

206
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:07,409
Well, here's why.

207
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:11,163
There are currently over
250,000 motels for sale

208
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:12,867
across North America.

209
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:14,917
Sadly, it's a dying industry,

210
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:16,853
but not one
without potential.

211
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:20,742
Now, apply our
reinvigoration model.

212
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:23,591
Reinvigoration.

213
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:27,714
Um, should I just wait
until it unfreezes?

214
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:30,315
Billion dollar company
and none of us can stop

215
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,984
technology from cacking out,
am I right?

216
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:34,971
- I'll get in touch with I.T.
- Okay.

217
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:37,124
What are you guys pumpin' in
here, pollen?

218
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,925
Do you mind if I have some
of that water there, please.

219
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:41,891
- Jesus.
Oh gosh!

220
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:43,697
- Roland! What are you doing?
- What?

221
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:45,284
- Why don't we take five, huh?
- Okay.

222
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:47,254
Don't worry.
We'll get this cleaned up.

223
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:49,137
- Good.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rose.

224
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:50,540
No, no need to apologize.

225
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:53,673
I think a quick five
would be a good idea.

226
00:08:53,758 --> 00:08:54,942
Here we go.

227
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:03,949
Oh gals!

228
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:05,817
You shouldn't have.

229
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:09,065
Jocelyn, are we now
moonlighting as town crier?

230
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,893
- Oh, no, Moira...
- Cheeky gawpus you.

231
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:13,360
Yes, it's true.

232
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:15,389
Our husbands,
at my husband's direction,

233
00:09:15,474 --> 00:09:18,429
are currently in New York City,

234
00:09:18,513 --> 00:09:22,215
vending their business
to the corporate cognizant.

235
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,089
Oh my gosh.
That's so exciting.

236
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:27,372
I wonder if they'll go
to the M&M's store?

237
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:28,400
Shall I?

238
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,603
Hence our impending move

239
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:33,000
to the big red delicious.

240
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:34,146
Excuse me?

241
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:36,465
Moira, I haven't said
anything yet.

242
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:39,302
Why the festivities then?

243
00:09:39,423 --> 00:09:41,209
Grace is moving to elm
valley.

244
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:43,527
<i>That's why the cake says
"Goodbye Grace".</i>

245
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:46,120
Oh I-I...

246
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:49,126
I thought you were singling out

247
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:51,779
one of my notable attributes.

248
00:09:53,481 --> 00:09:55,566
Shh. Okay, we'll just smooth
things over

249
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:57,217
until Grace arrives.

250
00:09:57,302 --> 00:10:00,320
- I-I'm right here.
- Yes you are!

251
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:02,858
Grace! Our timorous grinagog.

252
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:05,343
I think I'll miss you
most of all.

253
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,476
Moira, are you sure
it isn't a bit premature

254
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:09,611
to be talking about
all of this?

255
00:10:09,731 --> 00:10:11,651
No, don't you worry, Jocelyn.
Oh, you're kidding.

256
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:14,152
No, John has decades
on these people.

257
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:16,421
Okay. Well, that makes me
feel a little bit better.

258
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:18,156
I... I got a little concerned

259
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,535
when I got this text
from rolland,

260
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,737
but obviously I'm just
reading into it so.

261
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:23,340
You've received
correspondence?

262
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:26,026
What am I looking at?
A cartoon head exploding?

263
00:10:26,111 --> 00:10:28,634
Oh. It looks like three
cartoon heads exploding.

264
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:30,569
Well, then they're blowing
people's minds.

265
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:31,643
What's the concern?

266
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:34,305
It's just that usually when
rollie sends that emoji

267
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,241
it's like his head
is exploding.

268
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:37,538
It's like he's in trouble.

269
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:40,318
Yeah. I get a lot of those
texts during council meetings.

270
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:42,781
No, listen to me, Jocelyn.

271
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:46,079
The deal has to happen.
Because it has to.

272
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:48,764
Because there is no
alternative.

273
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:49,971
Okay?

274
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:52,141
It's as simple as that.

275
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,359
You're gripping my wrist
very tightly, moira.

276
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:57,725
Okay. Well, let's just
continue celebrating Grace.

277
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,194
- What?
- I'm Grace.

278
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,316
I know.
But she's not... you're-

279
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:04,636
you're not celebrating enough.
No.

280
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,955
I don't think you
took long enough.

281
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,466
Okay, am I holding
a treat for you?

282
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:17,081
I don't know, are you?

283
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,751
No. But you can share
my muffin.

284
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:21,337
Seriously.
What took you so long?

285
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,751
Are you sitting down?

286
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:24,528
I mean, I'm-I'm clearly not.
What's up?

287
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:25,830
So as we all know,

288
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,736
they are currently in New York
securing the deal.

289
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,814
They secured the deal?

290
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:31,046
They are there talking
to people in New York

291
00:11:31,131 --> 00:11:32,349
about securing the deal.

292
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:35,178
Anyway, when the deal
goes through

293
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,889
apparently their plan
is to move to New York.

294
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:41,539
Wait? Whose plan?
Your parents?

295
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:43,541
Yeah. And Alexis.

296
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:46,044
You seem awfully excited
for your family to move away?

297
00:11:46,128 --> 00:11:48,827
We would be moving with them!

298
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,248
What?

299
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:52,888
Yeah. Alexis has already
short-listed apartments for us.

300
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:54,786
One of them was featured
in season 3

301
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,203
of "sex and the city".

302
00:11:58,267 --> 00:11:59,869
Wow.

303
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:03,032
Don't-i don't
know what to say.

304
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:04,708
I know.
It's a lot to process.

305
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:06,444
I was overwhelmed at first
as well.

306
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:09,738
I mean, David,
our business is here.

307
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:12,837
Okay. What?
You-you don't wanna go?

308
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:14,739
Honestly? I don't know.
I...

309
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:16,165
Like you're just telling me

310
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,612
that you wanna uproot
our entire lives,

311
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,548
and it's just throwing me
for a bit of a loop.

312
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:23,697
Okay. Well, you know,
at this point it's just talk.

313
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:26,686
So there's a good chance that,
that the deal won't go through.

314
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:29,568
In which case, you know this
was just a big waste of time

315
00:12:29,703 --> 00:12:31,245
and frown lines.

316
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,718
I thought you'd be excited.

317
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:37,982
Would half a muffin help?

318
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:40,155
I'm not sure.

319
00:12:44,378 --> 00:12:47,691
Okay. Y-You took it
so that's a good sign.

320
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:55,683
Look, we can't let this bumpy
start derail why we're here.

321
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,582
And why are we here, Stevie?

322
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,774
Because we have an idea.

323
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:01,719
No. Because we have
a great idea.

324
00:13:01,804 --> 00:13:03,280
- And they should
- And they should bebe...

325
00:13:03,364 --> 00:13:04,708
lucky
to have us.

326
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:05,943
Damn right.

327
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:07,791
Johnny, sorry to interrupt,

328
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:09,095
but we're back up and running.

329
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,546
Oh, great.

330
00:13:11,753 --> 00:13:14,038
Okay. Let's do it.

331
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:15,793
So I came in two under par

332
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,729
and that is with half
the course under water.

333
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:19,937
It was-it ruined
the whole trip.

334
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:22,808
Horrible.
What course?

335
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:24,609
Ocean course on kauai.

336
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:25,953
Ah, what hotel?

337
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,701
We got a villa
at the St. Regis.

338
00:13:27,786 --> 00:13:30,004
Oh. Very nice. I've stayed
there quite a few times.

339
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:31,941
- Hm.
- Now let me ask you,

340
00:13:32,026 --> 00:13:35,654
how many of you
have stayed in a motel?

341
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:40,884
Well, motels are small hotels
without the golf courses

342
00:13:40,969 --> 00:13:42,293
in case you...

343
00:13:42,378 --> 00:13:44,006
Well, good-good-good.

344
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:45,673
So you're familiar at least.

345
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,878
Now, when I say "motel",
what comes to mind?

346
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:51,862
Uh, rundown? Unclean? Unsafe?

347
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:54,239
Yeah, that sounds about right.

348
00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:56,441
Well, that's what I used
to think.

349
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,917
I always saw motels
as a last resort,

350
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:01,713
a dreaded pit stop.

351
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,115
But I was wrong.

352
00:14:04,272 --> 00:14:07,919
Motels have the potential
of offering a window

353
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:10,588
into the unique charm

354
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:12,383
of small town life.

355
00:14:12,468 --> 00:14:15,316
And that's exactly what
the Rosebud Motel Group

356
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:16,570
plans to do.

357
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,106
Open that window

358
00:14:18,242 --> 00:14:21,332
and revitalize the classic
roadside motel

359
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:23,050
for a new generation.

360
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:26,807
Turns out,
a couple of coats of paint

361
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:29,186
and dusting off some
mid-century furniture

362
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,742
can go a long way.

363
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:32,047
That's right.

364
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:35,042
We've seen a 400% increase
in occupancy

365
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:36,893
since we started marketing.

366
00:14:37,232 --> 00:14:38,354
And cleaning.

367
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:41,218
And if this is what
we can do with one motel,

368
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:45,116
just imagine what we
can do with 10,000.

369
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:48,492
I'm not coming to you
for charity here,

370
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:50,408
I'm coming to you
with an opportunity.

371
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:53,728
There is value in these motels.

372
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,650
And if you're wondering
how I'm so sure...

373
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:01,640
My family and I have been
staying in a motel

374
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:03,349
for the past three years.

375
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:08,662
And I wouldn't trade our stay
there for anything.

376
00:15:09,646 --> 00:15:12,531
That's how strongly
I believe in this idea.

377
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:14,156
As Stevie can attest,

378
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:17,121
if my family can find peace
and comfort

379
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:19,724
staying at a motel,
anyone can.

380
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:22,594
And I can only wish
that one day soon

381
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:26,130
you and your families
can experience the love

382
00:15:26,214 --> 00:15:27,756
and simple pleasures

383
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:30,632
that come with staying
even for one night...

384
00:15:31,663 --> 00:15:33,636
At a Rosebud Motel.

385
00:15:34,622 --> 00:15:36,535
Where every stay

386
00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:38,919
feels like home.

387
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:42,018
Thank you for your time.

388
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:44,865
I think that's great.

389
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:50,146
Mr. Rose,
that was so good.

390
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,156
Did you see their faces?

391
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,825
I mean, I think-i think they
liked it.

392
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:55,771
Johnny, even I was impressed,

393
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,661
and I thought you had blown it
for all of us.

394
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:59,497
Didn't you have a briefcase?

395
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:02,100
See this is what happens
when Johnny impresses me.

396
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:04,235
I get confused and I forget
what I'm doing.

397
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:06,237
What was in that briefcase
anyway?

398
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:08,106
Nothing. You told me to look
intimidating.

399
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,729
So I brought a briefcase.

400
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:11,708
I'll go get it.
I'll meet you guys downstairs.

401
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:13,932
Mr. Rose, you were so good.

402
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:16,469
<i>First a video
store, now a motel chain.</i>

403
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:18,850
What? He wants to
reinvent the pager next?

404
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:29,931
I uh... forgot my briefcase.

405
00:16:30,016 --> 00:16:31,833
Don't wanna forget that.

406
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:36,199
Do you people know what
it took for Johnny Rose

407
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:37,557
to come back and do this?

408
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:39,776
After being away
for all that time?

409
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:44,348
Shame on you.
Shame on all of you.

410
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,648
Okay. I just realized you
guys are flying us home.

411
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:52,065
So I apologize for my outburst,

412
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,267
but I don't regret it.

413
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:56,921
The man's a legend.

414
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,746
Family!

415
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:10,393
- What's going on?
- Nothing is going on, David.

416
00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:12,301
I'm just worried
about your father.

417
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:14,645
I don't believe the two of you
were encouraging enough

418
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,676
before he left.

419
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:18,046
- I made him a card.
- And I said "take care".

420
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:19,648
We need to do something.

421
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:21,849
Send some energy his way.

422
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:23,565
Hands, children.

423
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,874
What's going on?

424
00:17:25,156 --> 00:17:26,305
Perhaps we should kneel.

425
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,372
- Okay. You're scaring me.
- Please.

426
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:29,974
Hm.

427
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:34,076
- Ow!
- Ooh.

428
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:35,533
Okay, are we praying?

429
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:37,069
Don't be ridiculous.

430
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:38,838
To whom it may concern:

431
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:41,208
There's a man out there,
my husband,

432
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:43,828
he's out there trying to build
back what we've lost.

433
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:46,537
And... I'm sorry; 5'10',
slow talker...

434
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:48,187
Okay. I think they get it.

435
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,431
It's our turn
to send him abetment.

436
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,105
It's just that this is
feeling a bit desperate.

437
00:17:52,189 --> 00:17:53,477
Can we do this
without holding hands?

438
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,878
No! He's worked so hard
while the rest of us

439
00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:57,619
have just been flailing about.

440
00:17:57,704 --> 00:17:58,881
I don't think
that's accurate.

441
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:01,051
- Absolutely not the case.
- I implore you...

442
00:18:01,162 --> 00:18:02,612
Please forward the following;

443
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:05,379
John. My macho man.

444
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:07,977
You don't deserve
another failure.

445
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:09,346
Oh.

446
00:18:09,431 --> 00:18:10,750
Okay. What is happening?

447
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:12,720
I don't know, David,
just go with it.

448
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,960
John, we're here for you.

449
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:22,440
Oh, Alexis your hands
as dry as an Autumn leaf.

450
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:24,325
- Eww.
- Shh.

451
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:28,421
Well, I'm just happy
it's over, Stevie.

452
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:30,003
Those rooms are never easy,

453
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:31,768
but you were right there
when I needed you.

454
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:34,106
Okay, I got my briefcase,

455
00:18:34,436 --> 00:18:35,826
let's go. Where is the car?

456
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:37,696
Well, we still have
a few minutes, Rolland.

457
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:40,099
We finished early,
the car is not here yet.

458
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:43,035
I can't wait to pop some
champagne on that plane.

459
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,074
We can finally start
enjoying ourselves.

460
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,366
Um, Johnny, let's not jump
the gun just yet, okay?

461
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:50,501
- Mr. Rose.
- Ruth.

462
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,241
Did we forget something else?

463
00:18:52,326 --> 00:18:54,785
Uh Ruth, we don't need
to be ushered out,

464
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,741
we know where the door is.
Come on, guys.

465
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:58,041
I just wanted to come out

466
00:18:58,126 --> 00:19:00,402
and personally thank you
for your pitch.

467
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:02,213
Well, you're welcome.

468
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:05,283
It felt like we really turned
things around in there.

469
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:07,751
You certainly did.
But between us,

470
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:09,687
they won't be moving
forward with the idea.

471
00:19:09,771 --> 00:19:11,554
How can they even decide
that fast?

472
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:12,794
It's okay, Stevie.

473
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:15,202
They've turned down
a thousand good ideas.

474
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:17,695
I was in the room when
they passed on uber.

475
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:19,451
Well...

476
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:22,390
I guess, I guess that's it.

477
00:19:23,504 --> 00:19:26,112
I really shouldn't be saying
this on company soil,

478
00:19:26,197 --> 00:19:27,915
but two of the junior
partners and I

479
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,118
are in the process of starting
our own firm.

480
00:19:30,441 --> 00:19:32,542
We've got the team,
we've secured the capital,

481
00:19:32,627 --> 00:19:34,510
and we're planning on
launching next month,

482
00:19:34,595 --> 00:19:37,468
and this is exactly
the kind of project

483
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:38,883
we're hoping to get behind.

484
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,263
Maybe I should wait
to hear from Mike first.

485
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,868
Johnny, I think you should
listen to her.

486
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:46,308
Believe me,
those people up there,

487
00:19:46,474 --> 00:19:48,977
they don't deserve to be
in business with you.

488
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:51,134
Mr. Rose, I don't know,

489
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:53,787
I feel like I'm getting
a good vibe from her.

490
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:56,442
We would love
to take you for lunch

491
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:58,079
and hear more
about your proposal.

492
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,651
Okay, I hear another vehicle.
Heavier tread.

493
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:14,019
Oh my god. They're gonna get
here when they get here.

494
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:21,463
Is that... could that be their
limousine?

495
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:24,077
That's them!

496
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:26,617
Oh, your father's insistence
on telling us in person

497
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:28,821
could so go either way.

498
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:31,316
This threat of failure
is inhumane.

499
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:32,769
<i>No, I think
it's exciting.</i>

500
00:20:32,854 --> 00:20:34,305
It's like "deal or no deal",

501
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:36,289
but with the rest of our
lives.

502
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,197
John! No!

503
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:02,094
So you're like
a businesswoman now.

504
00:21:02,237 --> 00:21:03,461
Damn right I am.

505
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:06,320
I sealed the deal.
It was really me.

506
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:08,224
- Oh my god!
- We did it!

507
00:21:08,357 --> 00:21:09,842
We all did it!

508
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:12,597
Champagne!
Champagne for all!

509
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:16,146
- We only have zampagne.
- Zampagne for all!

510
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,706
Yes!

511
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:22,868

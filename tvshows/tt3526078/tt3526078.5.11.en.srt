1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,000
(Bird caws, dog barks)

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,105
Okay so, as we all know,

3
00:00:04,206 --> 00:00:05,906
I think surprise parties are tacky,

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:08,542
and far too often organized
by well-intentioned people

5
00:00:08,643 --> 00:00:09,910
with very bad taste.

6
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:13,180
But... Patrick has always wanted one,

7
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:14,415
poor thing.

8
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:18,185
So I am throwing him a
surprise party... tonight.

9
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:20,264
Johnny: Well David, these
kinds of parties take time,

10
00:00:20,296 --> 00:00:21,798
and... planning.

11
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:24,191
Now, when I planned that
Casablanca-themed party

12
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:25,635
for your mother's 40th,

13
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,971
I had to quarantine
the camels for a month.

14
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:29,463
- Mhmm.
- Yeah David,

15
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,556
this is all feeling very
sketchy and last minute-y.

16
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:34,077
I've actually been organizing
this for quite some time,

17
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:35,903
I'm just telling you right now

18
00:00:35,928 --> 00:00:38,129
because I know that none
of you can keep a secret.

19
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:40,217
Oh! At 9 a.m. it's a little early

20
00:00:40,242 --> 00:00:42,309
for character assassination.

21
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,988
Not one of you knows how
the "Crows" movie ends.

22
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:46,914
You told me the day you got home.

23
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,773
You gave me the script.

24
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,328
And you were both sworn to secrecy,

25
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:52,720
so David is right not to trust you.

26
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:54,698
Yeah, this is why I'm
reluctant to tell you

27
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:58,523
that there is an extra surprise tonight.

28
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,691
I invited Patrick's parents.

29
00:01:01,716 --> 00:01:03,264
Oh my God, David!

30
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:07,320
Oh, that is very exciting news, son!

31
00:01:07,345 --> 00:01:08,912
Meeting the parents!

32
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:10,504
That's a big step.

33
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,749
Yes, things are certainly racing along

34
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:15,743
at a dangerously rapid velocity.

35
00:01:15,768 --> 00:01:17,045
Thank you so much, we're doing great.

36
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,257
Now, I will only be
throwing one surprise party,

37
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:21,749
and one surprise party only.

38
00:01:21,774 --> 00:01:23,927
So tonight there will be a surprise.

39
00:01:23,952 --> 00:01:25,252
And there will be tears.

40
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:27,867
Even if they're just my own. Okay?

41
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:31,601
How did it end again?
Like, a crowmageddon?

42
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:32,927
Crowpocalypse.

43
00:01:32,952 --> 00:01:35,851
- But you didn't hear it from me.
- (Snickers)

44
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:37,767
- So...
- Wow.

45
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:42,757

46
00:01:43,305 --> 00:01:45,172
This is a really big deal, Johnny.

47
00:01:45,197 --> 00:01:47,384
I mean, meeting my best friend's son's

48
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:50,420
boyfriend's parents
for the very first time,

49
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:51,946
I am very touched that you wanted me

50
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:53,438
to share this moment with you.

51
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:55,659
I asked you to mow the
lawn three times, Roland,

52
00:01:55,684 --> 00:01:58,552
So you being here is more
your decision than mine.

53
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,044
(Door latch clicks)

54
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:01,522
- Oh! Clint... Hello.

55
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:03,214
Oh, hi!

56
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,759
- Hi.
- You must be the Brewers.

57
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:08,685
I'm Clint. This is my wife, Marci.

58
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,344
What a special moment
this is for all of us, huh?

59
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:13,910
- (Chuckles)
- You must be David's Dad.

60
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:17,004
Oh, no, no! I do get
that all the time, though.

61
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:19,740
It's uh, you know, you've got
David's handsome looks there,

62
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:20,832
and then my face.

63
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:22,958
Yeah, I'm David's father, Johnny Rose.

64
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:24,843
Johnny, it's a pleasure to meet you.

65
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,013
- Yes, hi.
- Hi.

66
00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:27,772
Now, Patrick tells me you run the motel.

67
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:29,550
More like, runs it into the ground.

68
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:32,143
(Laughs uproariously)

69
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,288
Oh, we do have a lot of
fun around here, don't we?

70
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:35,747
We do, sometimes.

71
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:37,650
Roland, do you want to
get the room key for them?

72
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:38,675
Sure.

73
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,895
So this is all very exciting.

74
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,387
I assume we'll see you tonight?

75
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,114
Oh you definitely will.

76
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,828
So Patrick has been
keeping us up to date

77
00:02:46,853 --> 00:02:49,145
about everything he and
David have been doing,

78
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,953
and I think it's amazing
how far they've come.

79
00:02:51,978 --> 00:02:53,941
Yes, yes, yes it is.

80
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,952
But uh, I'll have to admit,

81
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:59,213
I've been somewhat of a
skeptic about those two.

82
00:02:59,238 --> 00:03:01,573
This one isn't as
progressive as the rest of us.

83
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,326
It's a generational thing with him.

84
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:05,753
I was talking about the store, Roland.

85
00:03:05,778 --> 00:03:07,679
You know, mixing a business relationship

86
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:10,691
and a romantic
relationship, well, that's...

87
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:12,684
it can get kinda tricky sometimes.

88
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,598
I-I-I missed
the last part

89
00:03:17,623 --> 00:03:19,679
of what you just said. The uh...

90
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:22,303
Oh, well, you were aware
they were in business

91
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:25,063
together as well, right?

92
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:27,322
We knew that part, yes.

93
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:31,578
Really? Because it kind of
seems like the two of you

94
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:34,953
just found out some really
shocking information.

95
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:37,924
Did I... speak out of turn?

96
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,920
I-I think we'll just go to the room,

97
00:03:39,945 --> 00:03:42,547
and get ready for the
big surprise tonight.

98
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,109
Oh, sure.

99
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:47,473
(Door latch clicks)

100
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:51,665
(Door slams)

101
00:03:51,937 --> 00:03:54,969
Huh. Correct me if
I'm wrong here, Johnny.

102
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:57,180
But it kinda seems like they didn't know

103
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:59,796
their son is in a
relationship with David.

104
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:06,347
(Gasps) You're looking especially fresh

105
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,373
and photogenic today, Mother.

106
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:09,832
Why thank you, Alexis.

107
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:11,742
Perhaps it's my excellent news.

108
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,854
I found a very promising revenue stream

109
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,166
to help finance the little
deficit we've accrued

110
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:18,359
- on "Cabaret".
- What might that be?

111
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:20,051
Well, according to the radio,

112
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:23,364
there's a darling little
medical clinic in Elm Grove.

113
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,224
Where if any one of us,
say, you, or your father,

114
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:29,476
participates in a few nugatory tests,

115
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:32,983
we could be bringing
in over $200 a week!

116
00:04:33,008 --> 00:04:34,174
(Gasps)

117
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,788
Or, you could make
$2,000 in one afternoon.

118
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,481
Ugh, which test is this?

119
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:42,792
I'm talking about the
soap opera fan convention

120
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:44,284
that's happening today.

121
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:45,695
I looked at your calendar,

122
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,321
so I know that you have the day off.

123
00:04:47,346 --> 00:04:49,047
Working from home.

124
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:51,759
I already purchased a booth.
Your name is on the website,

125
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:53,461
and I just printed out
all of these headshots

126
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:54,787
for you to sign.

127
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:56,864
Obviously I will be taking commission.

128
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:58,608
Alexis, there's a good reason

129
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:00,934
I've avoided these
conventions in the past.

130
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,026
Showing up, taking
your picture with a...

131
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:06,803
motley crew of pale,
dewy-faced salamander people.

132
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:09,319
I haven't hit rock bottom quite yet.

133
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,421
It's a matter of self-worth.

134
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:13,847
You did a commercial for adult diapers!

135
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:15,406
In Japan!

136
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,395
In full-face Kabuki makeup!

137
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,454
Okay. As your acting publicist,

138
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,313
I'm putting my foot down.

139
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:23,930
We're doing this. You need the money,

140
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:25,632
and this is how you're gonna get it.

141
00:05:26,565 --> 00:05:28,066
Look at you.

142
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:30,130
- Hmm!
- Very well.

143
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:32,000
But there will be a safe
word in case the gaggle

144
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:34,960
of asymmetrical faces
gets to be too much.

145
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:37,217
Deal. I'll start the car.

146
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:42,355
(Car rumbles)

147
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,779
Okay, so I told Patrick
that there's a salmonella

148
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,290
outbreak at the cafe,

149
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:50,385
so he will not be coming here
until I tell him to tonight.

150
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:53,921
Oh. Is it possible you could maybe...

151
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:55,589
choose a lie that doesn't make the cafe

152
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:57,715
look like it's in
violation of health codes?

153
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,825
I think it's a pretty good one.

154
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,251
(Panting) David!

155
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,175
You said you were only
gonna be half an hour.

156
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,466
(Panting)

157
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,358
Did you run here, Mr. Rose?

158
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:10,580
No! Just a pleasant walk.

159
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:12,973
Okay, I'm on a site
survey for the party.

160
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,265
Why, what's going on?

161
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,455
Well, I-I just checked in
"you know who's" parents.

162
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,080
What? They're not supposed to be here

163
00:06:20,105 --> 00:06:21,839
for another 11 minutes!

164
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:23,765
Well, nothing to worry about.

165
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,225
Um, random question for you.

166
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:29,538
They're aware that you
and Patrick are uh...

167
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:32,418
romantically involved, right?

168
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,758
Of course they are.
Why wouldn't they be?

169
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:37,040
Well, they're definitely aware

170
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:38,899
that you're business partners,

171
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:41,044
it's just that uh, if I recall,

172
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:44,528
at one point Patrick was engaged

173
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:46,273
ahem... to a woman, so...

174
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:48,041
Okay, what did you say to them?

175
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:49,243
Nothing, nothing!

176
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:51,654
It's more how they
reacted when I brought up

177
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,390
the fact that you two were...

178
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:56,426
romantically in
business with each other.

179
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:57,234
Ew!

180
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,395
Yeah, they-they looked
a little... shaken.

181
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,822
- Shaken?
- Well, upset.

182
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:04,348
- Upset?!
- David, they know, right?

183
00:07:04,526 --> 00:07:05,959
Of course they know!

184
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:08,252
I wouldn't have asked them
to come here if I didn't think

185
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:10,640
they knew we were in a relationship!

186
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:13,867
They call the store all the time!

187
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:15,569
I mean, what do they think,

188
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:17,762
I'm just his business partner?!

189
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:19,588
- Possibly.
- I mean, yeah.

190
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:21,451
Oh my God! Okay!

191
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:24,578
Everybody calm down! Nobody
say a word to anybody!

192
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:27,126
- Well, that sounds reasonable.
- What did I just say?!

193
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,318
(Car door slams, horn honks)

194
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:32,786
A few things to expect.

195
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:35,122
Now, the fans will either
want a signed picture,

196
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:36,263
a picture and a handshake,

197
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:38,192
or a picture either of you, or with you.

198
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:39,593
Well, that's reasonable.

199
00:07:39,618 --> 00:07:42,138
Now, if they ask for
pictures of your feet...

200
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:44,798
Hailey, you have been more than helpful.

201
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:47,358
If I might have a moment
alone with my daughter?

202
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,773
Slash publicist, thank you.

203
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:54,980
Alexis dear, now is bad
a time as any to tell you.

204
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:57,044
There is a dark side
to Mummy's industry,

205
00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:00,538
and I've tried to protect
you from it your whole life.

206
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,131
You took me to the Playboy
Mansion when I was seven.

207
00:08:03,156 --> 00:08:06,092
And you had a wonderful time
in the children's grotto.

208
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:07,705
But, this!

209
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,498
Alexis, you shouldn't have to see this.

210
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,060
Thespians selling their
autographs for money

211
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:16,087
in cheerless convention centers.

212
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:17,473
- Mhmm.
- Oh God, no!

213
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,999
We have to get out of here, Alexis!

214
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:22,627
- What's going on?
- That's Gloria Gregson.

215
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:25,305
Who's Gloria Gregson?

216
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,031
Who's Gloria Gregson?!

217
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:29,209
She only played Grace
on "Touched With Grace"

218
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:30,787
for 37 years.

219
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:33,780
The woman has 17 Emmys
for playing a hot-headed

220
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,626
nurse who healed people
with her sexual touch.

221
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:39,853
I can't have her see
me in a place like this!

222
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:41,913
- Come on!
- Moira?

223
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,605
Mmm!

224
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,287
No, no, it is...

225
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:48,826
the Gloria Gregson?

226
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:51,398
Oh, darling!

227
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:54,162
Well, look at you, you look gorgeous!

228
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:55,869
I'm so glad you're here, darling.

229
00:08:55,894 --> 00:08:59,197
I'm usually the only
marquee name at these things.

230
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:02,175
I'm shocked by my presence as well.

231
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,688
And I am Alexis Rose, Moira's
publicist and daughter.

232
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:08,015
Oh! Daughter? More like sister.

233
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,802
- (Laughs)
- Ew.

234
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,554
(Insects buzz)

235
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:19,669
(Key rattles in lock)

236
00:09:19,694 --> 00:09:21,161
Happy Birthday!

237
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,220
Thank you.

238
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:24,679
Flowers are for you;
the pizza's my lunch.

239
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,849
- Hi.
- Hi.

240
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,980
Mm! So, how's the store?

241
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:34,107
Thriving. But more
importantly, how are you?

242
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:38,254
You gotten some calls from
some family or friends?

243
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,239
Yeah, I talked to my
parents a little while ago.

244
00:09:40,264 --> 00:09:42,132
They're on like, a weekend getaway,

245
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:44,191
so they couldn't chat long, but...

246
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,984
Did you tell them about dinner?

247
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:48,265
Uh, they were actually just
pulling up to their hotel

248
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:51,024
so they had to jump off but...

249
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:55,838
Oh. Um, speaking of your parents,

250
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:57,374
I've been piecing
together that I don't think

251
00:09:57,398 --> 00:10:01,240
I ever spoken to them outside of work.

252
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:02,751
Is that weird?

253
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,907
Okay. I'm sure you... I'm sure you have.

254
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:07,990
Yeah...

255
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:11,881
Like, they know about me, right?

256
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,024
Of course they know about
you, what do you mean?

257
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,279
What are you-why?

258
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,032
Like they know about "us", right?

259
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:23,711
Um...

260
00:10:28,435 --> 00:10:30,897
<i>Okay listen, David.</i>

261
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,942
I've have been wanting
to tell them about us.

262
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:36,746
I really have, I just was
waiting to do it in person,

263
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:39,573
and then I didn't go
home for the holidays,

264
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,818
and then I was feeling
so comfortable with you,

265
00:10:41,843 --> 00:10:43,844
- and your family.
- Yeah.

266
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:46,981
Yeah, I-I don't know
why I assumed, um...

267
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:51,518
So all this time, your parents
thought they were just...

268
00:10:51,543 --> 00:10:54,927
talking to your...
your business partner?

269
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,690
Okay.

270
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:02,663
David, I know my
parents are good people,

271
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,701
I just... (Emotional exhale)

272
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:09,296
Hmm...

273
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:12,076
I can't shake this, this fear that...

274
00:11:13,096 --> 00:11:16,399
there is a small chance that
this could change everything.

275
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:18,588
That they might see me differently,

276
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:19,980
or treat me differently.

277
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:21,858
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

278
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:23,192
But I'm gonna deal with this

279
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:24,553
as soon as I see them next, okay?

280
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:27,980
Okay, what you're dealing
with is very personal.

281
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:31,335
And something you should
only do on your terms.

282
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:33,452
Okay?

283
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:38,942
That's why I brought
this couple home one day

284
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,944
in college, and just told
my parents to deal with it.

285
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:43,204
(Laughs)

286
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:44,814
I'm a take-charge guy, David.

287
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,784
I like to take charge of things
in my life, you know that.

288
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,136
Yep, mhmm.

289
00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:53,389
You're upset. I would be, too.

290
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:56,149
Yeah. Uh, it's not about that.

291
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,706
Ahem... heh.

292
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:01,497
You're gonna laugh yourself

293
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:03,457
right out of the closet on this one.

294
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:06,175
You know how you've always
wanted a surprise party?

295
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:09,472
David, I don't think this
is how surprise parties work.

296
00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:11,364
Yeah, I know, it's just...

297
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:14,699
part of that surprise was inviting...

298
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,841
your parents... here.

299
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:20,292
What?

300
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:23,143
Yeah. I realize that was a big mistake.

301
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:25,736
I-I should've talked to you.

302
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:33,553
I could be just your
business partner tonight.

303
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:36,490
- If that will help.
- No, David.

304
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:39,060
I, I can't have you do that.

305
00:12:40,478 --> 00:12:42,912
I owe it to us to tell them.

306
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:47,035
I want them to know.

307
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:50,871
(Laughs) Yeah, maybe this whole thing

308
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,063
is a blessing in disguise, huh?

309
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:58,023
- It's at the cafe?
- Yeah.

310
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:00,013
The salmonella was a decoy.

311

315
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:22,299
Hi, Mrs. Brewer, Mr. Brewer.

316
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:24,320
I'm... I'm David Rose.

317
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,438
Oh, David, come in.

318
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:29,564
Oh, thank you.

319
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:30,848
Um...

320
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:32,273
I uh,

321
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:34,012
I brought you some things from the store

322
00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:36,672
as a welcome present. We
ran out of the body milk,

323
00:13:36,697 --> 00:13:38,165
so I threw in some extra lip balms.

324
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,558
Thank you, David.

325
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,218
I just wanted to come here and apologize

326
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:46,084
for a very unfortunate miscommunication.

327
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:48,516
So you're not in a
relationship with our son?

328
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:50,018
- Oh, no. I very much am.
- Oh.

329
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:52,659
Um, I was talking more
about how you found out.

330
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:55,661
Was it something we did, David?

331
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,954
- I'm sorry?
- Honey, stop!

332
00:13:57,979 --> 00:13:59,713
No, I wanna ask.

333
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,573
Do you think if we'd
done things differently,

334
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:03,308
- that Patrick would still be...
- I understand that this news

335
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:05,800
can come as a shock... to some people.

336
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:08,726
But he is still the same person,

337
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:10,628
and it's his birthday, and he...

338
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:13,975
David, we're not upset
about Patrick being gay.

339
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:15,410
No.

340
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:17,388
Oh my God, okay!

341
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:19,480
For a minute I thought this
was gonna get very dark.

342
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:21,206
Ahem!

343
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:23,061
The thought that Patrick
was feeling like he couldn't

344
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:24,585
come and talk to us about this.

345
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:27,155
Is it because we were
so close with Rachel?

346
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,680
(Quiet knock)

347
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:32,093
- Hi.
- David.

348
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,405
Oh, hi.

349
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,759
Hi, Clint, Marci.

350
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:39,233
I see you've met my son.

351
00:14:39,335 --> 00:14:42,103
How are you, David? Happy, I hope.

352
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,580
Uh, 'cause at the end of the day,

353
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:45,406
that-that's all that matters, isn't it?

354
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:46,765
Dad, it's fine.

355
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:50,299
They, they are fine
with Patrick being gay.

356
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:53,205
Oh. Oh, good.

357
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,198
Good, then no one really has to feel bad

358
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:58,991
about how this information
came out, then, huh?

359
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:00,812
So what do we do now?

360
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:02,080
Not go to the party?

361
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:03,516
I don't want to make him uncomfortable.

362
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,342
No, no, no, we are
all going to the party.

363
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:09,478
Patrick is planning
on telling you tonight.

364
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,391
So I think the best birthday
gift we could give him

365
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:13,249
at this point is to just...

366
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:15,494
keep him in the closet until then.

367
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:17,029
I know that came out wrong,

368
00:15:17,054 --> 00:15:19,121
but we all understand
what I'm saying, right?

369
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:20,465
Okay.

370
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,824
- Okay.
- Yeah.

371
00:15:22,893 --> 00:15:24,126
Whew!

372
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:25,619
(Birds chirp)

373
00:15:25,644 --> 00:15:28,331
As actresses we have to do
whatever it takes to survive.

374
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:30,943
Which is why I'm on
the convention circuit.

375
00:15:30,968 --> 00:15:32,702
I do dozens a year.

376
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:34,746
I still can't quite believe that.

377
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:36,872
Well, can you believe
that because of them,

378
00:15:36,897 --> 00:15:39,418
I have a vineyard in
the south of France?

379
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,553
You may have tried my wine,

380
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:43,079
"Touched With Grapes."

381
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:46,358
- Oh my God, that's your wine?
- Yes.

382
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:47,917
We used to use that for sangria,

383
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:50,019
because it was like, so cheap, and...

384
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,787
so good.

385
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:55,625
So the fiscal sweetener
negates any discomfiture

386
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,804
one might feel exploiting
their extremities

387
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:00,563
for a $20 bill?

388
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:02,999
$20?! I charge $50.

389
00:16:03,024 --> 00:16:05,477
And just in case, I
wear open-toed sandals.

390
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:07,503
Darling, I used to spend my entire time

391
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:09,081
chasing after parts,

392
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:10,725
worrying about what
people thought of me.

393
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,785
It was exhausting! But no more.

394
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:17,459
These conventions are a godsend.

395
00:16:17,484 --> 00:16:21,154
There is a freedom in letting go, Moira.

396
00:16:22,886 --> 00:16:24,253
(Convention goers chatter)

397
00:16:24,354 --> 00:16:26,822
Okay Alexis, let's do this
before I change my mind.

398
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:28,190
- Are you sure?
- Mhmm.

399
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,103
I don't want you to feel
like I'm pressuring you

400
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:31,661
- into anything.
- Oh, I'm sure.

401
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:33,672
As Gregson said, to milk
this for all it's worth.

402
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:35,297
So let's get it going.

403
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:37,776
I have some fans to meet!

404
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:39,535
(Crowd cheers)

405
00:16:39,962 --> 00:16:41,813
Okay, here's how it's gonna go down.

406
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:43,673
It's 30 seconds each, tickets in hand,

407
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:45,717
or it's back of the line, and no,

408
00:16:45,742 --> 00:16:48,778
she will not be clarifying
any "Sunrise Bay" plot points.

409
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:50,722
- Ahem! Feet!
- Oh yes.

410
00:16:50,747 --> 00:16:53,182
And if we're talking
feet, it's $75 for one,

411
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:54,926
$150 for the pair.

412
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:56,786
(Crowd chatters)

413
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:58,896
(Crickets chirp)

414
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:02,525
He's coming, he's coming!

415
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:04,427
Okay, he's coming, he's coming.

416
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:05,561
So are we on lights?

417
00:17:05,662 --> 00:17:07,483
Also, we're going with "Surprise."

418
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:09,408
"Happy Birthday" was too wordy,

419
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:10,873
and we couldn't nail it at rehearsal.

420
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:12,935
- Okay.
- Okay! Okay, great.

421
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:15,580
(Bell on door rings)

422
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:18,240
- (Patrick sighs)
- All: Surprise!

423
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:19,566
Oh my gosh!

424
00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:22,211
David, I thought we were
just having a casual dinner.

425
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:23,903
Mhmm.

426
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:26,840
Johnny: Happy Birthday, Patrick!

427
00:17:27,117 --> 00:17:29,452
What is happening? I thought
you guys were out of town!

428
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:31,511
- Well, we are.
- (Both laugh)

429
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:33,989
We're just so happy to be included.

430
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:36,659
You've got a really wonderful
friend here, Patrick.

431
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,362
Yep, I'm just glad you could
make it, Mr. and Mrs. Brewer.

432
00:17:40,464 --> 00:17:41,697
Um...

433
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:43,775
well, I should leave
you all to catch up,

434
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,768
and spend some quality
time with your son.

435
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:47,746
But might I recommend the crab cakes?

436
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:50,224
I over-ordered, and they
cost a small fortune.

437
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:52,317
Hey, could I just have
two seconds with him?

438
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:53,576
Sure.

439
00:17:56,538 --> 00:17:58,839
What if they don't react
the way I think they will?

440
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:01,917
Then I will be here.

441
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:03,929
And we'll get through it together.

442
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:05,856
Okay...

443
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,157
- I love you.
- I love you.

444
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:10,449
(Inhales deeply)

445
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:15,131
<i>Well, I am suitably surprised.</i>

446
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:16,599
<i>Thank you guys for coming.</i>

447
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,467
Clint: Well, we wouldn't miss it.

448
00:18:18,568 --> 00:18:20,169
We just love you so much.

449
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,204
I love you guys, too.

450
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:25,089
- But um...
- Both: (Eagerly) Yes?

451
00:18:26,276 --> 00:18:28,677
Well, there's something that uh...

452
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:29,989
that I've been meaning to tell you.

453
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:32,281
- You can tell us anything!
- Honey, let's just...

454
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:33,840
let him talk.

455
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:36,576
Uh, yeah.

456
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:38,795
So I guess this doesn't
really come naturally.

457
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,889
Um... David...

458
00:18:41,944 --> 00:18:43,936
He seems like a really
great partner, honey.

459
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,442
- Marci.
- In business.

460
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:48,001
Yeah, he is.

461
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:51,801
He's also a great partner
outside of business.

462
00:18:54,037 --> 00:18:55,481
We're together.

463
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:58,583
David is my boyfriend.

464
00:18:59,284 --> 00:19:01,886
And I've never been happier in my life.

465
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:06,848
And so I just, I hope
you guys can accept that.

466
00:19:08,985 --> 00:19:12,254
Ohh! You are the only thing in the world

467
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,080
that matters to us.

468
00:19:14,662 --> 00:19:17,998
And if David makes you happy,
then that's all we care about.

469
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,071
(Emotionally) Dad?

470
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:25,501
I like him.

471
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:28,199
I like him a lot. (Laughs)

472
00:19:28,224 --> 00:19:30,248
Me too.

473
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,184
I don't understand his clothes, but...

474
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:33,709
(All laugh)

475
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:36,411
Ah, you will in time.

476
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,579
(Relieved) Oh man,

477
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,062
I didn't know how I
was gonna tell you guys.

478
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,689
Well, we're just glad you finally did.

479
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,786
Happy birthday, my sweet boy.

480
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:52,394
Thank you.

481
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:56,799
♪

482
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:09,305
So I know that you're annoyed
that the surprise got blown,

483
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,708
but this party might go down

484
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,734
as one of the happiest
nights of my life.

485
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:16,324
Well, I guess that makes up for the fact

486
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,208
that no one ate the crab cakes.

487
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:19,435
Well...

488
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:22,850
so how long have they known?

489
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,989
- I'm sorry?
- My parents.

490
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:28,549
How long have they known? About us?

491
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:30,948
Um, I don't know, I don't
know what you're talking about.

492
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,559
David, I know my parents.

493
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:35,384
They're not good actors.

494
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:37,176
They knew about us, right?

495
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,464
Okay, my Dad might've told them,

496
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,724
but he, he thought they knew.

497
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:45,418
And the gift basket that you gave them

498
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:47,077
that I'm hoping you paid for,

499
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:48,989
that had nothing to do with you

500
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,015
trying to smooth things over with them?

501
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:54,728
It was just a very messy day,

502
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,621
And I was, I was trying
to detangle things, and...

503
00:20:57,911 --> 00:21:00,684
- and just make everything okay.
- Yeah.

504
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:03,688
Well, you made everything okay.

505
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,167
Twyla: Not to step on the moment,

506
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:11,489
but uh, I do have to lock up in five.

507
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:13,871
- Oh.
- Right.

508
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:17,508
♪ What a feeling in my soul

509
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:19,834
♪ Love burns brighter
than sunshine ♪

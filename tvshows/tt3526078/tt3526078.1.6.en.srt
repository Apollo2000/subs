1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,477
Hey, Moira, could you
turn that down please?

2
00:00:02,478 --> 00:00:04,646
Important call coming through.

3
00:00:04,647 --> 00:00:07,115
Stevie says it's the guy from the winery.

4
00:00:07,116 --> 00:00:10,051
Hmm.

5
00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:15,056
Hello, Johnny Rose.

6
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:18,927
Hello? Hello?

7
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:21,029
Ah.

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,665
Stevie?

9
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,467
- I put it through!
- Okay.

10
00:00:25,468 --> 00:00:27,836
- Who is it?
- Herb Ertlinger.

11
00:00:27,837 --> 00:00:30,105
- Excuse me?
- Herb Ertlinger from the winery.

12
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:32,274
He's the only guy that's gotten
back to me on my proposal.

13
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:33,446
And-and now the ph-

14
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:37,178
Hi! Hello!

15
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:43,251
There's something wrong with the phones!

16
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:46,221
John, have her patch it
through to the kids' room.

17
00:00:46,222 --> 00:00:48,557
Yeah, patch it through to the kids' room!

18
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:49,958
Okay!

19
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:54,830
Very good suggestion!

20
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:56,998
Kids!

21
00:00:56,999 --> 00:00:59,768
David, answer the phone!

22
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:01,837
He has his headphones in; He can't hear it.

23
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:04,372
- Then you answer it!
- Okay!

24
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:08,009
Hello?

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,978
Alexis, could you open the door, please?

26
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:11,179
I'll take it.

27
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:11,913
No, sorry, you have the wrong room.

28
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:13,882
He's actually in room 6.

29
00:01:13,883 --> 00:01:15,917
Alexis, unlock the door please!

30
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:20,355
Okay! No problem. Bye.

31
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:22,090
He's gonna call you back in your room!

32
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:26,661
No!

33
00:01:26,662 --> 00:01:29,831
Hello?

34
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:38,975

35
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:42,611
Can you get a heart murmur
from a lack of sleep?

36
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:44,346
Because I have not slept
since we've got here

37
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:45,893
and I think my body is shutting down.

38
00:01:45,894 --> 00:01:48,817
Well, I hate to admit it, but I actually
know very little about heart murmurs.

39
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,285
Well, I have one.

40
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:52,621
Uh, the pulse is very irregular.

41
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:54,489
Honestly, David, I have
tried to find my pulse

42
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,558
like a thousand times and
nothing. So don't worry about it.

43
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:57,659
No, this is very serious!

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,060
My heart has not rested in a long time,

45
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:01,029
my immune system is very low,

46
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,465
I have not been able to
find kale anywhere here-

47
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:05,533
how long are we going to
be talking about you for?

48
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:07,335
I think I'm having a heart
attack, is what's happening!

49
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,570
David, you are like 34.

50
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:10,438
I'm basically 29.

51
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,207
Oh my God, you are overreacting.

52
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,608
I think you're gonna feel very guilty

53
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:15,477
when I slip into a coma and
you have to come visit me

54
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:17,812
in the hospital at hospice.

55
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:19,948
Well, I'm gonna go for a jog,
so don't die until I get back.

56
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:22,350
Well, how long are you going for?

57
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,952
Um, I don't really know. How long
are you gonna be like this for?

58
00:02:23,953 --> 00:02:25,720
- Don't be a little b...
- Bye!

59
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:27,655
When I'm this state!

60
00:02:34,163 --> 00:02:37,132
Now, it's fruit wine,
which is exciting in itself.

61
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:39,000
But the thing we're most proud of

62
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:42,237
is that our fruit is 100% insecticide free.

63
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:43,772
- Ah!
- Mm!

64
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:45,206
Mm! Mm.

65
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,609
There's something in mine.

66
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,147
Oh, that's a ladybug.
That's one of the good ones.

67
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:51,579
Excuse me.

68
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,316
Herb Ertlinger...

69
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:56,685
No, this tastes like something
one should not put in their mouth.

70
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:59,120
It's fruit wine. Whoever
heard of fruit wine?

71
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:01,423
Doesn't matter, it's a
business. I'll make it work.

72
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:03,024
It's next to a landfill, John.

73
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:05,493
He said former landfill.

74
00:03:05,494 --> 00:03:08,163
Sorry. I was looking into a new sprayer.

75
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:10,265
And I brought you this...

76
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:12,534
It's our Cabernet Merlot petit grenache.

77
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:13,969
Oh!

78
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,938
Sounds delightfully busy.

79
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,407
You know, uh, Herb, if you
need any help with distribution,

80
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,876
I have extensive contacts in that area,

81
00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:24,946
or if it's operations management...

82
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:26,514
Johnny, while I appreciate that offer,

83
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:29,084
it's actually not your
help I'm looking for.

84
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:31,453
- Oh.
- No. It's you, Moira.

85
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:34,589
We were hoping that you
will be the spokesperson

86
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,325
for Herb Ertlinger fruit wines.

87
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:39,494
I-I don't understand.

88
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:42,330
My wife and I were such
big fans of "Sunrise Bay."

89
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:44,632
And we would be an honoured to have you

90
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:46,935
do just a few commercials
to promote our wine.

91
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:49,471
That is, of course, if you like it.

92
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:52,807
Like it? It's fruit
wine. What's not to like?

93
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:02,050
So, an hour ago, I thought
I was having a heart attack.

94
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:03,885
- Oh no!
- Yup, yup. Yup.

95
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:06,021
- Um, but I'm not.
- Oh, phew!

96
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:09,524
According to Web MD, I'm
having a pulmonary embolism,

97
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:11,826
which is much, much worse.

98
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:13,361
Well, you look good.

99
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:15,163
That's... just the way I look.

100
00:04:15,164 --> 00:04:17,799
I need you to take me
to a hospital right now.

101
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,001
Yeah, the only hospital's in Elmdale.

102
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:21,736
You're telling me there's
no doctor around here?

103
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:24,572
People just drop dead in the
streets out of sheer neglect?

104
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:27,442
Well, there is, technically, a doctor.

105
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:30,011
Then, please take me to
that doctor right now.

106
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:33,181
I'm just not sleeping.

107
00:04:33,182 --> 00:04:34,949
I think there's a lack of
oxygen getting to my heart

108
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,618
because I'm feeling very suffocated.

109
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:38,753
Okay, right. Well, if it is a heart attack

110
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:40,388
we're way too far away
from the nearest hospital

111
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:41,831
for you to make it through the night.

112
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:42,891
- What?
- Kidding.

113
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:44,659
Take a deep breath for me.

114
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,728
Good.

115
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:48,969
Now, have you been around any
feces in the past two days?

116
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:52,700
- I don't n...
- So, no.

117
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:54,836
- No.
- Okay. Well, the good thing is,

118
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,738
I don't think that you
need an ambulance, David,

119
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:58,606
because what I think is happening here

120
00:04:58,607 --> 00:05:00,875
is you're having a panic attack.

121
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,577
Oh no, those... Those aren't real.

122
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:04,579
Those are a PR spin for
celebrity publicists.

123
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,949
Trust me, I've known enough celebrities.

124
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,652
No, it's absolutely a... A real thing.

125
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:12,420
Uh, tell me, have you
had any experiences lately

126
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:15,990
that have caused you... Stress or anxiety?

127
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:18,860
Uh, well, I went from living
in a 25 hundred square foot

128
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,562
Soho live/workspace

129
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:23,031
to a motel room with my sister.

130
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:26,334
Wow. Eek. That'll do it.

131
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:28,569
"Hello, I'm Moira Rose for Herb-"

132
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:35,743
"Oh, hi! I'm Moira Rose
for Herb Ertlinger wines

133
00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:38,446
inviting you to try our latest offering,

134
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:41,916
a fruity cab franc we call...

135
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:44,319
We call Herb Ertlinger's fruity cab-"

136
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,340
Oh, no. No, no, no. No good.

137
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,392
Uh...

138
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:55,029
"Smokey tannins infuse this rich
blend with a plummy bouquet."

139
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,233
"Plummy bouquet"? Is this guy for real?

140
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:00,269
His turns of phrase
leave much to be desired,

141
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,237
but the wine is potable.

142
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,205
You called it liquid stink this morning.

143
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:06,141
The whites seem less stinky.

144
00:06:06,142 --> 00:06:08,877
How about this tote bag?

145
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:11,079
Two-ply toilet paper has more heft.

146
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,748
I'm sensing negativity, John.

147
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:17,218
Is this because he did not
take you up on your offer?

148
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:20,722
Are you kidding me? Come on!

149
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:23,458
Hey, I haven't even given that guy
a second's thought since I got home.

150
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,793
I was doing him a favour, that's all.

151
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:27,662
I don't want him
tarnishing your reputation.

152
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:29,412
I mean, have you read the literature?

153
00:06:29,413 --> 00:06:31,399
Look at this.

154
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,502
"The maximum benefit of
the peachafication process."

155
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:37,238
"Peachafication!" Who uses
a word like "peachafication"?

156
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:40,074
A moron... would use that.

157
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:43,678
That moron is the first moron to offer
me an acting role in a very long time.

158
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:45,480
Well, he's lucky to have you.

159
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:50,185
John, this commercial, in
the right hands, could be...

160
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:51,619
I don't want to use the word "comeback,"

161
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,689
that's... I don't wanna jinx it, but...

162
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,458
John, no one knows the
business better than you do.

163
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,628
Oh, honey, I'm just the
money behind the scenes.

164
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,464
Not that I don't have a few company
commercials under my belt, but...

165
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,000
If you want me in your corner, I'm there.

166
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:09,437
Oh, John. Thank you.

167
00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:11,239
- I'll do what I can.
- Thank you.

168
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,709
But seriously, how cheap ass is that bag?

169
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,377
Ew, ew-ew, ew, ew!

170
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:18,218
You have to open your
eyes to get it in the bag!

171
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:20,481
Ugh! Good. Ugh!

172
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:24,052
So can I ask you a question?

173
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:25,653
Why do you always get
dressed up to do this?

174
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,223
I mean, it doesn't seem very practical.

175
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:31,092
Naomi Campbell wore Dolce & Gabbana couture

176
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:33,194
to her community service.

177
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:34,762
And just because she
was picking up roadkill

178
00:07:34,763 --> 00:07:36,664
did not mean that she
needed to look like it.

179
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:40,101
And I just always really
admired her courage.

180
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:45,873
Um... I didn't understand
a word you just said.

181
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:49,244
Besides, it's nice to uh... Change
clothes every once in a while.

182
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:52,981
Something you might wanna
consider doing at some point.

183
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:54,782
I change my clothes.

184
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:56,384
They're just all the same.

185
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:59,821
Uh-huh. Yeah.

186
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:02,190
Oh! Well, at least now they'll get washed.

187
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,691
Agghhhh!

188
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,227
Come on! Run!

189
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,109
What? It's actually nice in here.

190
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,810
Well, I'm not Valentino, but you know.

191
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:25,680
Okay, well, don't try
and be funny about it.

192
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:27,882
It just happens naturally.

193
00:08:30,486 --> 00:08:32,854
It's that um...

194
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:34,956
When a guy can pack his whole wardrobe

195
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:36,491
into an overnight bag,

196
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:40,061
you just don't really think that
he'd be much of an interior designer.

197
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,933
Don't worry, they're fresh. They're clean.

198
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:50,396
Hmm. Ooh! Smell that
rock-beaten freshness.

199
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,808
What?

200
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:56,210
It's just I do beat my
laundry against rocks.

201
00:08:56,211 --> 00:08:58,346
You're a freak.

202
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:20,921
What uh... what kind of
lens are we using here?

203
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:23,256
It's uh... It's a zoom lens.

204
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:24,591
Oh, zoom! Good, good, good.

205
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:26,159
- Yup, yeah.
- Any primes?

206
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,461
Any primes? Using any primes?

207
00:09:28,462 --> 00:09:30,830
Nah. Those are usually for feature films.

208
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:34,935
Yeah. Yeah. No, it's just I...

209
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:37,003
What's the, uh, ring light situation?

210
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:38,772
Do you think we need an inkey?

211
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:39,973
Uh... I don't know, I don't know...

212
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:45,006
I... are we booming this... Today?

213
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:56,856
- Ew!
- Shhh!

214
00:09:56,857 --> 00:09:58,858
Why is it dark?

215
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,560
It's like a witch's house in here, David.

216
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:02,128
- Shush!
- What's going on?

217
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:04,097
I am on day two of a panic attack

218
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:06,666
and I have not slept at all.

219
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:10,637
Babe, you know that panic
attacks aren't real, right?

220
00:10:10,638 --> 00:10:12,839
They're just things that
celebrities make up to...

221
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,048
No, I know. I thought
so too, but they are real

222
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,648
and I'm having one apparently.

223
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,511
Okay. Okay.

224
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:20,513
Well, while you were
having your panic attack,

225
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:25,485
I somehow agreed to attend a yoga class.

226
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:27,087
That might be a good thing for me.

227
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:28,688
Okay, well, I'm not gonna go though.

228
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:30,557
That might help me relax,
might help me calm down.

229
00:10:30,558 --> 00:10:32,492
David, I just said I'm not gonna go.

230
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:35,028
I don't wanna have to bring this up...

231
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:38,531
But it's my turn to take a selfish.

232
00:10:38,532 --> 00:10:39,954
- No, David,
- Yes, it is.

233
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:42,936
- You selfished last time.
- No. Dubai, 2010,

234
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:45,399
I had to pick you up from that blind date

235
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,200
that went terribly wrong.

236
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:51,237
It was a total disaster. It's my turn,

237
00:10:51,238 --> 00:10:53,206
and I wanna go to a yoga class.

238
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:55,541
Fine, I will go,

239
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,276
but I am not happy about this at all.

240
00:10:57,277 --> 00:10:59,178
Okay. Get off my bed.

241
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:02,148
Ouch, David. Ouch, David!

242
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:04,617
- Ugh!
- Shut the curtains!

243
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:08,755
Oh, some people like to exaggerate,

244
00:11:08,756 --> 00:11:10,925
especially in our business.

245
00:11:10,926 --> 00:11:13,158
I dunno. A lot of people
on set were saying it.

246
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,694
He's making people nervous.

247
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:17,830
I don't care what other's
say. That's today's mantra.

248
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:22,168
- You look awesome!
- Oh...

249
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:24,570
- Hey! There she is!
- Hi!

250
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:27,140
There's my TV star. Hi, sweetheart.

251
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:28,808
- Hi!
- Nervous?

252
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:31,277
- No, I'm good.
- Good! Don't want you nervous!

253
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:33,780
- No.
- Is that the outfit you're wearing?

254
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:36,215
Yes. That's the one you
and I chose together.

255
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:38,488
Oh. It looks a little less
flattering in the daylight.

256
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,212
Johnny!

257
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:41,320
No. I'm just saying, if
there's another outfit-

258
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:43,356
- No! There's no second choice.
- Really?

259
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:45,091
- No.
- Oh, I don't know.

260
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:46,359
- Cheese tray.
- Whoa, whoa, cubby,

261
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,428
what's this? Who ordered cheese?

262
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:50,329
- I... I asked for cheese.
- Oh no, no. No cheese.

263
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,531
I don't think that's a good idea.

264
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:53,066
- What about the melon?
- You ordered melon?

265
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:54,133
- No, I didn't.
- No, well, let's see...

266
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:55,568
You know what? Looks a little soft.

267
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:58,571
Why don't we eighty-six that plate.

268
00:11:58,572 --> 00:12:00,106
- Johnny? Johnny?
- Yeah?

269
00:12:00,107 --> 00:12:02,642
- Crystal, do you mind?
- Yeah. Hey, crystal.

270
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:04,644
- Speak to my husband.
- Hey.

271
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:07,113
Yeah... listen. The script,
I wanna make a few line-

272
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:09,382
No! John, no more changes.

273
00:12:09,383 --> 00:12:12,452
I was wondering if it
might be better if you-

274
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:14,387
Just directed. Just directed?

275
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:15,788
Believe me, I tried. That didn't fly.

276
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:17,623
No. Went home.

277
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:22,795
- Went home?
- Mm-hmm.

278
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:24,731
- Why?
- Because you're making me nervous.

279
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:26,532
And apparently you're
making everyone nervous.

280
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:28,468
No, no, no. Honey, I'm just trying to help.

281
00:12:28,469 --> 00:12:30,303
I'm just trying to be...
You know, watching your back.

282
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:32,538
I know, John. You're so good at trying.

283
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:34,273
Now, I'm gonna call
you as soon as I'm done.

284
00:12:34,274 --> 00:12:37,643
- Crystal?
- Yeah?

285
00:12:37,644 --> 00:12:39,979
Yeah, sure. Well, I can just uh...

286
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,114
Yeah, I'll just uh... go home.

287
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:44,250
Bye.

288
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:47,687
- All right.
- Bye.

289
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:50,289
All right. Have a good shoot!

290
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:54,694
- You look good.
- No, keep working please.

291
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:06,139
- Oh!
- Okay, I don't think I can do this.

292
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,373
There's a lot of people here.

293
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:10,143
Hey! You guys made it! Amazing!

294
00:13:10,144 --> 00:13:12,311
It's a pairs class, so partner up.

295
00:13:15,616 --> 00:13:16,516
Okay, well, I'm not touching you.

296
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:18,351
Well, I'm not touching you.

297
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:20,253
- David, Hun.
- Oh!

298
00:13:20,254 --> 00:13:23,222
- Come join me.
- Oh... Jocelyn.

299
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:24,457
Normally I do this with Roland,

300
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,326
but he had a bad burrito so he's M.I.A.

301
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:29,195
- Oh...
- Trust me, that's good news for everybody.

302
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:30,930
I'm sure it is.

303
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:33,933
And Alexis, you can join Mutt.

304
00:13:33,934 --> 00:13:37,203
Okay.

305
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:39,505
This is gonna be good for you. Just relax.

306
00:13:39,506 --> 00:13:41,641
- Oh, okay. All right.
- Okay.

307
00:13:41,642 --> 00:13:44,143
- Hi.
- Hey.

308
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:51,784
Ted told me all about your...

309
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:53,352
Nervous breakdown.

310
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:57,156
My... my what?

311
00:13:57,157 --> 00:13:59,759
I was at the cafe. He
didn't mention any names,

312
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,095
but when he said it was
someone "precious," I knew.

313
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,933
- Slating!
- ...Somehow.

314
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:08,601
Remember to smile.

315
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:10,770
- All right, get out of there, ladies!
- Thank you.

316
00:14:10,771 --> 00:14:12,905
And action!

317
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:15,775
Hello, I'm Moira Rose.

318
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:19,478
And if you like fruit wine as much as I do,

319
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:24,650
discover a winery that pours care
and craftsmanship into every glace.

320
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:27,053
Oh, I'm sorry.

321
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:30,423
I wanted to say glass,
but I... was thinking case.

322
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:31,858
That was great. Loved it.

323
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:34,160
Uh, same energy. Back
to one. Still rolling.

324
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:35,862
Check your teeth. Yeah.

325
00:14:35,863 --> 00:14:37,430
Outta there, ladies.

326
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:39,999
Still rolling... And when you're ready-

327
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,534
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

328
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:43,102
Action.

329
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:45,538
Hello, I'm Moira Rose,

330
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:47,840
and if you enjoy flute line as much as-

331
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:51,010
What?

332
00:14:51,011 --> 00:14:52,511
Uh... you said "flute line."

333
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:55,081
Oh. Oh, that is funny.

334
00:14:55,082 --> 00:14:58,017
No problem. Uh... back to ones.

335
00:14:58,018 --> 00:15:00,286
And when you're ready... Action!

336
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:02,755
Hello, I'm moina rose, and if you Li-

337
00:15:02,756 --> 00:15:04,056
Okay, back to ones. Still rolling.

338
00:15:04,057 --> 00:15:06,058
- Why? Why?
- You said "moina."

339
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:07,426
- You sure did.
- Are you sure?

340
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:09,228
- Yeah. Yeah, it's cool.
- I'm good.

341
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:10,429
- That's great. All right.
- Please, I'm good.

342
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,564
- Get outta there, ladies.
- Please, yes.

343
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:14,300
And... when you're ready, action!

344
00:15:19,306 --> 00:15:21,474
Action.

345
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:25,911
Action?

346
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:36,553
Well, thanks for the lift, Thomas.

347
00:15:36,554 --> 00:15:38,067
You got it, Mr. Rose.

348
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:40,110
Yeah, we're talking to her now.

349
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:42,028
Where'd she go?

350
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:45,431
Apparently she just locked
herself in the bathroom.

351
00:15:45,432 --> 00:15:47,900
He's gonna pull the plug on the
whole thing unless, and I quote,

352
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:50,670
"that Bitch gets her
Ass out of the trailer."

353
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:52,238
Maybe I should get back in the car?

354
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:53,906
I'm guessing, yes.

355
00:16:02,115 --> 00:16:05,618
Rolling the shoulders
back and down, lengthen...

356
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:07,420
It's just all these feelings
of displacement, you know?

357
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:08,587
- Like I've...
- Yeah...

358
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:10,356
I think I'm just having a very hard time

359
00:16:10,357 --> 00:16:13,592
adjusting to the overall
aesthetic of the town.

360
00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:15,161
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Um...

361
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:16,829
And it's just running through
my head and I've been...

362
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,398
Yeah, lots of talking. Lots of emoting.

363
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,902
That's good, David. Yeah.
Um, have you tried sex?

364
00:16:22,903 --> 00:16:25,471
- Excuse me?
- Sex puts me right to sleep.

365
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:29,108
- You should have lots and lots of sex.
- Ugh...

366
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:30,576
Now, with your partner's help,

367
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:33,579
send your hips to the back of the barn

368
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,950
and partners roll your biceps out and up,

369
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:40,619
guiding the hips wide and back.

370
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,722
- Is everyone doing this?
- Mm-hmm.

371
00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:44,790
- Um, how's your back?
- It's good.

372
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,792
I mean, normally, it's
a little tight, but...

373
00:16:46,793 --> 00:16:49,061
Yeah, it is. I mean I-I haven't noticed.

374
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:51,397
I have noticed, I haven't-

375
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:53,599
I haven't "noticed" noticed, so...

376
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,068
- How're we doing here?
- Good. Super good.

377
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:59,572
Um... this is a very challenging...

378
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:01,674
Yoga class, Twyla. Thank you.

379
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:03,743
Thanks! Yeah, so just
hold Mutt's lower back here

380
00:17:03,744 --> 00:17:05,077
just to support him.

381
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:06,579
- Okay.
- Good.

382
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,848
Now feel the inner edge of the thigh...

383
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:11,117
Mm-hmm.

384
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:13,099
Let's bring it down... Oh, no!

385
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,154
Oh!

386
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:16,542
Mutt should support his own thigh.

387
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,557
Omigod! Omigod! I'm so sorry.

388
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:20,393
I'm sssso sorry.

389
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:22,528
It's okay. Yeah.

390
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:24,230
Wow, I'm so sorry.

391
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:35,107
Moira? It's me.

392
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:36,275
Hi!

393
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:38,444
You okay?

394
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:42,114
Yeah... I blew it,
Johnny. I blew it big time.

395
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:43,949
Let me in, sweetheart.

396
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,652
Oh, I don't know how.

397
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:49,088
There's a knob on the door.

398
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:53,592
No, I mean I don't know
how to do this anymore!

399
00:17:53,593 --> 00:17:55,828
I'm no good!

400
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:05,037
How did you open the door?

401
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:07,907
I threw a shoe.

402
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:14,680
This wine is aw-ful!
Give me another glass.

403
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:18,447
Well, I think maybe we've
had... Enough wine, sweetheart.

404
00:18:18,448 --> 00:18:20,953
I, I can't feel my tongue.

405
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:24,557
But I know it's there because I'm talking.

406
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:27,126
Moira, you should hear what
they're saying about you out there.

407
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:30,461
- You are doing great.
- No. No, John. No.

408
00:18:30,462 --> 00:18:34,066
No, John, I ruined it. I ruined everything.

409
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,768
- No, no, you didn't.
- I did!

410
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:39,105
No, sweetheart, I ruined
everything. I ruined it.

411
00:18:39,106 --> 00:18:43,642
You did. Why... Why
did you ruin everything?

412
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:46,545
Okay, well, let-let's
not focus on me right now.

413
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:48,114
The important thing is,
you've gotta get back up

414
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:49,615
and you've gotta get out there.

415
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:53,152
I can't. Can't.

416
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:57,056
You can! Moira, remember "Sunrise Bay?"

417
00:18:57,057 --> 00:19:00,126
You were drunk most of season three...

418
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:04,029
And half of season four.

419
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,298
End of season five.

420
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:09,668
I'll have to take your word for it.

421
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:11,737
Did I used to have a drinking problem?

422
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:16,775
The point is, you can do this, Moira.

423
00:19:16,776 --> 00:19:20,179
You're radiant. You're beguiling.

424
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,016
You're daytime television's brightest star!

425
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:30,623
All you have to do is
go out there and shine.

426
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:33,092
I'm gonna.

427
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:35,628
I'm gonna Nail it.

428
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:37,129
Okay.

429
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,668
And on a big inhale...

430
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:46,272
Identify any tension you may be holding.

431
00:19:46,273 --> 00:19:48,941
And on a big exhale, breathe it out.

432
00:19:51,678 --> 00:19:55,781
I burnt my sausage casserole.

433
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:58,551
I'm pretty sure I'm really lonely here.

434
00:19:58,552 --> 00:20:00,986
Now, with one partner on the ground,

435
00:20:00,987 --> 00:20:03,455
the other comes into a downward dog

436
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:06,091
with hands on your partner's ankles.

437
00:20:18,188 --> 00:20:20,683
In the... of a picturesque ridge

438
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:24,562
lies a small, unpretentious winery,

439
00:20:24,563 --> 00:20:28,733
one that pampers its
fruit like its own babies.

440
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:31,269
Hi! I'm Moira Rose,

441
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,505
and if you love fruit wine as much as I do,

442
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:36,240
then you'll appreciate the craftsmanship

443
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:39,911
and quality of a local vintner

444
00:20:39,912 --> 00:20:41,913
who brings the musk melon goodness

445
00:20:41,914 --> 00:20:44,482
to his oak chardonnay,

446
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:47,685
and the dazzling peach cral-bapple

447
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:51,456
to his Riesling rioja.

448
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:55,326
Come taste the difference good
fruit can make in your wine.

449
00:20:55,327 --> 00:20:58,830
You'll remember the experience
and you'll remember the name.

450
00:20:58,831 --> 00:21:00,898
Herb erfling... Ger.

451
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:02,733
Burt herngeif.

452
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:05,303
Irv herb-blinger.

453
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:07,572
Bing livehaanger.

454
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:10,608
Liveling. Burt herkurn.

455
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:13,574
Ban-Bingo ling-!

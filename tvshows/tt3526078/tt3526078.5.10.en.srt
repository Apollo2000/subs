1
00:00:02,156 --> 00:00:03,956
I don't know why I'm
feeling this like deep,

2
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:05,558
aching sense of dread.

3
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:07,703
David, I'm more than capable
of looking after your store

4
00:00:07,728 --> 00:00:09,462
while you and Stevie
work the flea market.

5
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:12,074
Why did Patrick have
to book today of all days

6
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,062
for his tax seminar?

7
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:15,898
Like who voluntarily
goes to a tax seminar?

8
00:00:15,923 --> 00:00:18,759
Maybe the kinds of people who
want to keep their businesses?

9
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:20,827
Okay, hi.

10
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:24,043
You are literally only
here to receive a package.

11
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:26,103
So I cannot have you
distracted your phone...

12
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:28,863
unless there's an emergency.
And then immediately call...

13
00:00:28,888 --> 00:00:30,222
Call Patrick. I know!

14
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:32,294
No! Patrick is at the tax seminar!

15
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:33,887
Are you hearing anything I'm saying?!

16
00:00:33,912 --> 00:00:36,532
Yes. Stay off your phone.
Wait for the delivery man

17
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:38,558
to drop off whatever. You can trust me.

18
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,983
Okay, can I?

19
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:41,820
Because the last time I left
you in charge of something...

20
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:44,740
Ugh! This is about
those stupid Tamagotchi?

21
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:47,066
- Actually it is.
- Okay guys...

22
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:48,959
You left me with six of them, David.

23
00:00:48,984 --> 00:00:51,219
Taking care of that many
is like a full-time job!

24
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:55,417
I left you with six adult
Tamagotchis in perfect health!

25
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:58,077
And by the time I came
home, they were all dead.

26
00:00:58,102 --> 00:01:00,689
You have to like actively murder them

27
00:01:00,714 --> 00:01:02,982
- in order for that to happen!
- Okay, David,

28
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:05,828
um, as much as I love carrying
out all these boxes by myself,

29
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:07,499
I think she's going to be okay,

30
00:01:07,524 --> 00:01:09,725
so maybe you could give me a hand?

31
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:12,073
How did David con
you into this anyway?

32
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:14,571
It gives me an excuse to
take a break from rehearsals

33
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:16,429
with your mom for a day?

34
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:18,593
Um, last night she texted me at 3 A.M.

35
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:20,786
and all it said was "leggings."

36
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:23,546
- Hmm...
- We have to go.

37
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:25,648
Um, you're welcome,
by the way, David.

38
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:27,507
Who knows, maybe after today

39
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:30,100
you'll finally stop
talking about... Tamagotchi.

40
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,727
Unlikely... murderer.

42
00:01:42,747 --> 00:01:44,833
Unfortunately for everyone, John,

43
00:01:44,858 --> 00:01:46,859
Stevie turned out to be quite the find.

44
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:49,964
She'll need a lot of
direction obviously, but...

45
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:52,024
you know, ballet intensive,

46
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,386
perhaps some mittens
to curb the nail biting.

47
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:56,478
Moira, I love the
way you pour yourself

48
00:01:56,503 --> 00:01:57,589
into your projects.

49
00:01:57,614 --> 00:01:59,596
But the whole point of this spa trip

50
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:02,290
was to take a breather from cabaret.

51
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:05,754
Yes John. I promise to
enjoy the 60 minutes I'll spend

52
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:08,047
having my deepest tissues palpated.

53
00:02:08,148 --> 00:02:10,745
Then a few sips of cucumber water.

54
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,871
Factor in five minutes for
you to use the facilities

55
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,418
and we'll be back home by noon.

56
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:16,534
And we're not rushing
through this, Moira.

57
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:19,428
We've got an entire day
of treatments ahead of us.

58
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:21,776
Today is for slowing down,

59
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:25,386
and getting reacquainted
with our bodies.

60
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,102
Okay, just please give me
a moment to make a decision

61
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:30,433
on this chaise lounge.

62
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,063
Oh, put the phone down, Moira.

63
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:33,655
Whatever it is can wait.

64
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,815
It's for Fraulein Schneider's Salon.

65
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:38,420
Do you prefer the olive
suede to the Merlot?

66
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:41,987
Similar texture but falls
apart in emotional complexity.

67
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:44,183
I can't look right
now, Moira. I'm driving.

68
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,809
All right. I'll hold it up for you.

69
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,235
No, Moira, I can't right now.

70
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,927
It's just a quick glance, John!

71
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:50,596
All right, then you
need to hold it straighter.

72
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:52,522
That... oh-oh, what was that?

73
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:55,294
- A tiny speed bump.
- Speed bump?

74
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,686
We're in the middle of nowhere.

75
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:58,111
Why would there be a speed bump?

76
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,704
No, I think I, I think I hit an animal.

77
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:03,053
Oh, it's the circle of life, John.

78
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:05,671
You've just provided
a nice Passover Seder

79
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:07,797
for a family of hawks.

80
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:10,830
No... ew...

81
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:16,654
John,

82
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:18,518
don't get too close, dear.

83
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:20,853
We can't afford you contracting mange.

84
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,136
It's a cat, Moira. I hit a cat!

85
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:27,093
Well, what kind of ailurophobe

86
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:28,618
sends their kitty out to play

87
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:31,278
on such a busy stretch of highway?

88
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:33,604
It's got a collar!
This is someone's pet.

89
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:37,746
There's a farmhouse right there,

90
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:39,878
probably belongs to them.

91
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,376
Or not.

92
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:49,282
Okay, so this is really good,

93
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:51,684
we just need everything
facing forward. Facing forward.

94
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:54,596
Facing forward. See what I'm doing here?

95
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:56,189
Okay, like a serial killer?

96
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,025
David Rose!

97
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:02,097
- Oh God!
- Would you look at that?

98
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:04,263
If this isn't a full circle moment,

99
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:08,158
- then I'm not twice divorced.
- My God, Wendy!

100
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:10,351
This must be your wife.

101
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:11,511
- No.
- God, no.

102
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:13,870
No, no, Wendy, this
is my friend, Stevie.

103
00:04:13,928 --> 00:04:15,295
Stevie, this is Wendy.

104
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,654
Wendy used to employ
me at the Blouse Barn.

105
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:20,913
I'm so sorry, I don't
mean to jump to conclusions.

106
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:24,401
I guess I've got marriage
on the brain again.

107
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,201
If you can believe it, I'm engaged!

108
00:04:27,654 --> 00:04:29,822
- Hmm, wow.
- Congratulations.

109
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:32,849
Well, you know what
they say about love,

110
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:34,842
it's like target practice,

111
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:37,651
if you just keep shooting at it...

112
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:44,698
Anyway, David, I was hoping you
would have settled down by now!

113
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:47,440
Oh, I actually own this
business with my partner.

114
00:04:47,465 --> 00:04:48,999
Get outta town!

115
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:51,692
I know, I am as shocked as you are.

116
00:04:51,764 --> 00:04:54,900
Well, I guess that
makes us flea buddies.

117
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:56,472
I've got my own booth.

118
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,796
Wow, so we're
reopening the Blouse Barn?

119
00:04:58,828 --> 00:05:02,986
Oh, no, no, no, just test
driving a new business idea,

120
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:07,780
brought to me by my
new partner, Antonio.

121
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,875
Antonio!

122
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:11,902
What are you doing?

123
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:14,562
Come over here, so I can show you off!

124
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:18,763
Hey.

125
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:21,523
Well, Antonio, say hi to everyone.

126
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:23,807
- Hi.
- You look very familiar.

127
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:25,827
Have I seen you in my store before?

128
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:27,505
I don't think so.

129
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,431
Okay.

130
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:34,717
He seems sweet.

131
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:36,676
He reminds me a lot of you.

132
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:39,770
Well, isn't that a
compliment. For him.

133
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:43,414
I better get back and
help Tony set up the booth.

134
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,209
It was such a treat seeing you, David!

135
00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:49,272
And you, Karen!

136
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:52,569
Karen's a new one.

137
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:55,963
I have... definitely seen
that guy in my store before.

138
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,967
Do you think that
Wendy knows her fiancé

139
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:01,108
has been checking out every guy in here?

140
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,892
She has the worst taste in men.

141
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,418
At one point, she told me

142
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:08,111
she was looking for a Jon Gosselin type.

143
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:13,960
Sorry, we're closed.

144
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:15,061
Very funny.

145
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:17,697
Ugh, I was hoping you
were the delivery guy.

146
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:19,990
- Thanks.
- No, I'm just like, so bored.

147
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:23,250
Well, I am not the delivery
guy, but I come bearing gifts.

148
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,084
But I didn't pay for that.

149
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:30,844
I know, I got it at the flea market.

150
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:33,788
Thank you for the delivery.

151
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:36,281
Do you need my signature?

152
00:06:36,683 --> 00:06:38,303
Oops.

153
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,243
Oh... wow!

154
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:44,186
Uh... um, miss,

155
00:06:44,715 --> 00:06:48,084
seems that the strap has
fallen off of your shoulder.

156
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:50,530
I'd offer to put it back for you,

157
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:53,090
but as a delivery guy,

158
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:54,779
I don't know if it's my place.

159
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:57,600
Oh, how respectful.

160
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,845
Now, if only you had that
much respect for my time.

161
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:03,449
I've been waiting here forever.

162
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:05,942
Um, sorry that I'm late...

163
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:10,342
my... grandmother passed this morning.

164
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,288
Ew! Oh my God, Ted!

165
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:14,724
Sorry, I wasn't prepared for an improv.

166
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:16,583
No, it's fine, it's fine.

167
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,879
Okay, what else
weren't you prepared for?

168
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:25,311
- The... import taxes?
- Hmm...

169
00:07:25,832 --> 00:07:27,277
Okay, obviously I'm not good at this,

170
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:28,578
can we just skip to the good part?

171
00:07:28,602 --> 00:07:31,037
Yes. Okay.

172
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:35,408
So, you and I just
innocently witnessed

173
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:36,673
an 18-wheeler barreling down...

174
00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:38,458
Moira, I'm just gonna
be honest, all right?

175
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:41,957
There was an accident, it
was tragic, unavoidable,

176
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:44,217
and then we'll be on our way.

177
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:46,443
Mm-Kay.

178
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:54,845
Can I help you?

179
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:58,574
What... beautiful day, isn't it?

180
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:01,052
- Crops need rain.
- Yes, yes.

181
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,370
Oh, as they often do.

182
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:08,125
Um... well, we just had
an unfortunate thing...

183
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,220
My husband struck down
your feline with our car.

184
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:14,534
Well, we don't necessarily know

185
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:17,479
whether the cat belongs
to this uh, gentleman.

186
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:19,105
Well, what did it look like?

187
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,671
The name on the tags was "Sergio"?

188
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:25,701
Well, that was him.

189
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:28,733
Oh, these city people
driving too damn fast

190
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,303
up and down this road.

191
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:33,158
No, I-I don't think speed
was-was the thing here.

192
00:08:33,183 --> 00:08:36,178
No, my husband has what's
called a feather foot.

193
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:38,971
Well then, why did you stop?

194
00:08:39,072 --> 00:08:43,008
We thought it was...
the decent thing to do.

195
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,577
Um, now that's done,

196
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:46,803
and we have a very
pressing engagement so.

197
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:48,969
Well, my wife is so right,

198
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:51,596
we're running very late right now.

199
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:54,870
The Hammam Spas are
notoriously fickle about refunds.

200
00:08:54,895 --> 00:08:56,629
You're going to the spa?

201
00:08:56,957 --> 00:08:59,194
Well, that does sound important,

202
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:01,120
but since you just
killed my daughter's cat,

203
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:02,779
coming inside to break the news to her

204
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:04,504
might be a little bit more important.

205
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:06,272
Don't you think?

206
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:09,599
Hm, John, shall I pick
you up on the way back?

207
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:12,777
I know how desperate you were
for me to have my day of detox.

208
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,060
No! No, Moira!

209
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:18,741
I think it's better if
you... come inside with me,

210
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,333
so we can uh,

211
00:09:20,956 --> 00:09:23,691
break the news together.

212
00:09:27,398 --> 00:09:28,918
Okay, this is the last of them,

213
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,044
unless you wanted me to
bring in the 14 coffee cups

214
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:33,665
and 3 empty chip bags that
are also in your back seat?

215
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,325
Mhmm. David, remember when
you thought Wendy's partner

216
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,237
had been in your store before?

217
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:41,412
He has been in my store before.

218
00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:43,048
Well, I think I know
why he wasn't being

219
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:44,373
so upfront about it.

220
00:09:44,398 --> 00:09:45,878
Okay, I know what you're gonna say,

221
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:47,483
and I also thought that he
was into me for a second,

222
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:49,499
but I'm pretty sure
that's just his face.

223
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:51,758
No. Look over at their booth,

224
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:54,819
and tell me you don't
notice any similarities.

225
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:01,175
- What the actual fuck?!
- I know.

226
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,359
- They've ripped off our entire store.
- Yeah.

227
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:07,119
Tulips instead of roses? Woof!

228
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:09,831
Similar products. The
labels even look like ours.

229
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:11,524
Except, their stuff's half price.

230
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:13,283
What?

231
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:14,852
Well, we have a very loyal customer base

232
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:18,316
who would not be fooled
by some skanky knockoff.

233
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:20,709
Okay, Dave, I'm
ready to check out here.

234
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:22,435
Roland! What are you doing here?

235
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,837
You're supposed to be at the motel!

236
00:10:23,862 --> 00:10:26,597
I'm on my coffee break,
and I ran out of foot cream.

237
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:30,591
- Those are 3 for 15, yes?
- These are not from our store.

238
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:31,953
Well, what are you talking about?

239
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:33,612
I just got 'em off
your table over there.

240
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:34,975
That's not our table.

241
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,068
Well then, why were
you standing there?

242
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:40,382
That's not me! And
he's still standing there!

243
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:44,155
Okay um, do you want the sale, or not?

244
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,102
Uh no, you can buy
our superior foot cream

245
00:10:47,127 --> 00:10:48,461
at a slightly higher price.

246
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:50,472
Geez. You were a lot nicer

247
00:10:50,497 --> 00:10:52,565
when I was talking to you over there.

248
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:00,292
How far do you think we'd get

249
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:02,218
if we just started running?

250
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,816
When might we expect
your daughter to show up,

251
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:10,635
because we do have a
very busy day ahead of us?

252
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,894
Well, baby's still sleeping,

253
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:15,636
but if you wanna go and wake her up,

254
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:17,862
tell her what happened, by all means.

255
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,836
Where is Bebe's chamber?

256
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:24,630
Oh, there she is now.

257
00:11:24,655 --> 00:11:26,856
She's either up, or takin' a leak.

258
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:30,445
Either way, great progress for Bebe.

259
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,301
Here she is.

260
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:34,807
What's all this?

261
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:36,703
Who are you?

262
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:40,668
Uh, hi, Johnny Rose, Baby.

263
00:11:42,627 --> 00:11:44,728
- This is my uh...
- Sergio's dead!

264
00:11:44,753 --> 00:11:46,321
Ugh.

265
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:49,094
What the hell?

266
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,183
Yes, it seems he had taken ill,

267
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,738
and stumbled out on the road poor thing,

268
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:56,031
presumably to end it all.

269
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:57,923
And then?

270
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,773
And then we ran over him.

271
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

272
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:14,082
Anyway, this feels like a
very private family moment...

273
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,494
that we're more than willing to share.

274
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,167
That's for you.

275
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:31,557
Clearly that brand loyalty
you were talking about

276
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:33,438
is really paying off.

277
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:36,231
Like to pay you off
to not be here anymore.

278
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:40,054
Roland, what are
you still doing here?

279
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,680
This will only take a second.

280
00:12:41,857 --> 00:12:44,225
Dave, I don't know if
you remember or not,

281
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,451
but I purchased some foot
cream from you earlier?

282
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:48,329
That wasn't our foot cream.

283
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:50,222
Yeah, okay, well
you took my 15 bucks,

284
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:52,081
and now I'd like a refund,

285
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:53,817
because I realized I've
used this stuff before,

286
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:56,577
- and it makes my feet stink.
- Give me that.

287
00:12:58,698 --> 00:13:00,332
Ugh!

288
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:02,434
It smells like pennies and burps!

289
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:04,921
Oh yeah! Wait, that
smells exactly like the stuff

290
00:13:04,946 --> 00:13:06,280
we used to use at the motel.

291
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:09,004
- Ugh.
- Like, exactly.

292
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,385
Wait a second...

293
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:16,991
That's why!

294
00:13:17,016 --> 00:13:18,550
Gel Time Moist Liquid.

295
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:21,565
Contains 100% moist liquid.

296
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,033
- Uh
- oh, Davey got busted!

297
00:13:24,058 --> 00:13:25,924
Okay, this is not our product, Roland!

298
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:28,994
Anyone who sells counterfeit
luxury beauty products

299
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:30,659
is clearly a sociopath.

300
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,171
Dave, I don't wanna tell
you how to run your business,

301
00:13:33,196 --> 00:13:36,507
but 3 or 15 dollars for
Gel Time is a total rip-off.

302
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:39,444
I mean, pharmacies hand those
out for free on Halloween.

303
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:41,703
David, you have to talk to Wendy.

304
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:43,039
Okay, what am I gonna tell her?

305
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:46,385
That her curious life partner,
who looks nothing like me,

306
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,644
is some big old con artist?

307
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:51,895
$18 for toner?

308
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,241
Why don't you just on some Gel Time?

309
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,567
That stuff will strip
your skin right off.

310
00:13:57,965 --> 00:14:00,033
Ooh.

311
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:02,868
Whoa! That was...

312
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:05,651
I know, like are good,
but that was like...

313
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:07,611
You pulled some new tricks out.

314
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:08,992
New to you.

315
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:11,657
Anyway, David should
leave you in charge

316
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:13,726
of the store more often.

317
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:16,638
Um... Ted, the door was
unlocked the entire time!

318
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:18,264
What?

319
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,342
Someone could've
like, walked in on us.

320
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:22,568
They would've gotten quite the show!

321
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:27,035
It's very... irresponsible
and dangerous of us.

322
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,941
Well, now we know for next time.

323
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:31,210
Oh, um, I almost forgot,

324
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:33,737
I never signed for that parcel.

325
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,425
Uh, I don't think the guy showed up?

326
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,883
No, Ted...

327
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:43,680
Oh uh... oh, yeah I...
I'd get your signature,

328
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:47,269
but I guess I left my clipboard

329
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:49,428
and scanner thing somewhere, so.

330
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:52,007
Do you think it might
be in David's new bathroom?

331
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:54,009
Apparently it's just for customers,

332
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:55,835
but he never lets anyone use it.

333
00:14:56,012 --> 00:14:58,547
I remember now, I definitely
left my scanner thing in there.

334
00:14:58,572 --> 00:15:01,807
- Mhm... let's go
- let's go find your scanner thing.

335
00:15:01,907 --> 00:15:03,619
Can I just request we
actually drop the scanner

336
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:05,560
thing bit just 'cause
it's kinda throwing me off.

337
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:06,919
Yeah, okay.

338
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:10,149
Oh, this is nice!

339
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,451
- Uh
- Oh! Is that a sink?

340
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:13,886
Oh! A sink it is!

341
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:17,914
Help me up, babe.

342
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,161
- Oh my God!
- Fuck! Ugh!

343
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,243
How are we still trapped
in this Gothic horror show?

344
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,447
You know, I think we've
already missed the seaweed wrap,

345
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,574
and at this rate, it's not
looking good for the salt scrub.

346
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:38,253
You know, I wish there was
something else we could do here,

347
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,057
but uh, I really feel we've
overstayed our welcome.

348
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:44,250
Yes, we should really hit the road.

349
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:46,776
In that big, fancy car of yours?

350
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:50,374
Oh it's... it's big, but
it's not that fancy.

351
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:52,324
Listen folks,

352
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:53,959
we don't want much,

353
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,256
but you should cover the
expenses of the funeral.

354
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:01,250
The funeral... for your cat?

355
00:16:01,601 --> 00:16:03,736
Well, it was Baby's only cat.

356
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:05,981
Perhaps it's the lack of air,

357
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,140
but I believe I saw three or four cats

358
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:10,500
running around since
this interrogation began.

359
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:12,757
It was my only tabby.

360
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:15,590
Okay, well maybe there's
something we can do.

361
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,250
Does Bebe enjoy the theater?

362
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:19,676
Hmm?

363
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:22,501
How about two complimentary,

364
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:25,823
partially-obstructed
view seats to Cabaret?

365
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:28,617
No! She likes the Kinky Shoes.

366
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,481
You got tickets to Kinky Shoes?

367
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:34,541
I believe it's Kinky Boots. And no.

368
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:38,407
Well, maybe a professional massage

369
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:41,183
might help ease Baby's pain.

370
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,075
I like massages.

371
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,320
So, now you're
taking Bebe to the spa?

372
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:48,090
No, I wouldn't be taking her Moira,

373
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:52,184
but maybe Baby can take
her uh, grandmother.

374
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:53,777
- I'm her mother!
- Yes, well that...

375
00:16:53,802 --> 00:16:55,497
Yes, you are!

376
00:16:55,522 --> 00:16:59,892
And you are going to adore
the rejuvenating facial peel.

377
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,681
Can I keep the slippers?

378
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:06,298
This is my favourite after shave.

379
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:07,476
This is for you.

380
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:09,001
- Go!
- Okay.

381
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:12,338
On my feet...

382
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:14,431
- Hi.
- Wendy, hi!

383
00:17:14,456 --> 00:17:16,685
David! Isn't this great?

384
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,078
The two of us, back together!

385
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,972
Successful in business!
Successful in love.

386
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,718
- Mhmm, totally.
- Quick question for you, Wen...

387
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,507
You know, when Antonio
came to me with this idea,

388
00:17:28,532 --> 00:17:30,766
I wasn't sure there was a market

389
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,491
for another general store.

390
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:34,302
Everyone is doing them now.

391
00:17:34,327 --> 00:17:36,214
Yeah, I was one of
the first, but I get it.

392
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:38,340
And they sell all the same stuff.

393
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:41,201
I'm sure you've noticed a similarity

394
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,546
- between our products and yours.
- Sure did.

395
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:46,272
Wendy can I speak with you for a moment?

396
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:47,630
Sure.

397
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:50,361
Why don't we go over to your booth?

398
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:52,888
It's so much quieter.

399
00:17:52,913 --> 00:17:54,413
Okay.

400
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:59,270
Um, I don't wanna be the
one to have to tell you this,

401
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,463
but it's about your fiancé...

402
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,609
You know Brad?

403
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:07,335
- Who's Brad?
- My fiance.

404
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,695
I thought you and Antonio were...

405
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,721
Oh David...

406
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:14,348
We're business partners.

407
00:18:14,601 --> 00:18:17,085
Oh! Okay.

408
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:19,705
Well, that's gonna make
this a little easier.

409
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,884
Turns out Antonio is a common criminal.

410
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,169
- What?
- Stevie give me the...

411
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:27,656
Look at this, please.

412
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,892
100% moist liquid?

413
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:34,563
Antonio said it was locally sourced.

414
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:36,874
Sure. If you consider
the dollar store local.

415
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:38,967
These sell for 99 cents.

416
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,993
Well, he's been charging me way more!

417
00:18:41,507 --> 00:18:43,338
I'm so sorry, you had to hear this.

418
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:45,264
No, David,

419
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:46,975
I'm glad you told me.

420
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,602
I was gonna go into
business with this person.

421
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,814
And I'm ashamed to say,

422
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:55,074
in my weaker moments,

423
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:59,086
I've been tempted to
cheat on poor, sweet Brad.

424
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,047
With Antonio?

425
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,893
Well, obviously you picked up

426
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:07,342
on the intense heat between us

427
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:10,532
- if you thought we were a couple.
- Yeah.

428
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:12,024
Wendy, for several reasons

429
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:14,135
I think you need to
say goodbye to Antonio.

430
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,705
Ugh. How I'm gonna tell Brad.

431
00:19:17,046 --> 00:19:19,674
He and Antonio are roommates.

432
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:23,044
They share this tiny
one-bedroom together.

433
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:25,513
And it is so crowded in there,

434
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:27,740
they had to put the
mirror on the ceiling.

435
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:31,052
Yeah. Best to shut
all that down, I think.

436
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:33,288
David,

437
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:36,258
what would I do without you?

438
00:19:36,446 --> 00:19:38,613
I literally don't know, Wendy.

439
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:42,982
You wanna get high?

440
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:46,078
- No, but thank you.
- Okay.

441
00:19:51,702 --> 00:19:54,146
Okay. So, the delivery man came in,

442
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:56,007
used the bathroom,

443
00:19:56,032 --> 00:19:58,000
somehow broke the sink,

444
00:19:58,025 --> 00:20:01,060
and then left without
delivering the package.

445
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:04,373
That is correct.

446
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,851
I just find it strange that
he would then leave a note

447
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:08,710
saying, "sorry I missed you".

448
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,956
Yeah. No...

449
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:12,533
I think he meant, like,
sorry I missed you.

450
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:14,659
Because I was here the entire time.

451
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:16,729
And I actually think that he
was like a little bit drunk,

452
00:20:16,753 --> 00:20:19,121
because he knocked over a lot of things.

453
00:20:19,146 --> 00:20:20,647
And you were here for this?

454
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:22,439
Um, no...

455
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:25,470
Well, you were here for part of it.

456
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:28,304
Right. But I got here late...

457
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:31,076
my grandmother passed away.

458
00:20:31,101 --> 00:20:33,102
- Oh God!
- A few years ago.

459
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:35,295
And it just been real tough to get over.

460
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:36,874
Mhmm.

461
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:38,984
Well, fortunately we had these
security cameras installed,

462
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:41,277
so I guess I'll just show
that to the insurance people?

463
00:20:41,302 --> 00:20:42,735
I don't really know how this works,

464
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,468
Patrick went to that seminar.

465
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:46,348
Oh. Um...

466
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:49,828
honestly, I-I don't think
that you wanna do that.

467
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:54,256
You said that I could trust you.

468
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,501
First, the Tamagotchies, now this!

469
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:57,960
Get out of my store.

470
00:20:57,985 --> 00:20:59,629
Okay, fine. You can
take the money for the sink

471
00:20:59,654 --> 00:21:01,465
out of what you were
going to pay me for today.

472
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,135
I wasn't planning
on paying you anything.

473
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,660
Get out!

474
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:06,568
You too. Very disappointed.

475
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:08,380
And if we're pointing fingers, David,

476
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:10,873
I've done it on a lot of sinks
and I've never had an issue.

477
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:12,852
When you say you've done
it on a lot of sinks...

478
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:14,076
Out!

479
00:21:14,177 --> 00:21:15,911
Hmm.

480
00:21:15,936 --> 00:21:19,187
Ugh! I don't wanna touch this.

481

1
00:00:01,984 --> 00:00:03,359
Do you like this sweater?

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:06,420
Jared Leto gave it to me and I've
always been on the fence about it.

3
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:08,773
I don't know.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,476
What do you mean, you don't know?

5
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:12,036
You either like it, or you don't like it.

6
00:00:12,203 --> 00:00:14,439
I mean, I like it 'cause
Jared Leto gave it to you,

7
00:00:14,464 --> 00:00:16,781
and he was my first kiss,
but I don't know if I like,

8
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:17,984
like it, like it.

9
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:20,320
Um, that's not really an answer.

10
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:21,769
I feel really bad,

11
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:23,740
I feel like there's something
burning in my throat.

12
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,808
Oh my God, well, you could've
answered the question by now.

13
00:00:25,843 --> 00:00:27,296
So I guess I'm wearing it.

14
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:29,945
Dad, can you bring me some juice?

15
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,968
- Be right there, honey!
- Yes, we'll be right there!

16
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,671
I knew this day would come, John!

17
00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:36,103
Isolated, impoverished,

18
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:37,996
cut off from all medical services!

19
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,274
I only prayed it wouldn't be Alexis.

20
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:43,125
- It's just a cold, Moira.
- Oh, it's always just a cold, John,

21
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,827
until it's full blown... Typhoid!

22
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:47,406
I don't have typhoid!

23
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:49,890
Well, of course you don't,
what are the chances of that?!

24
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:51,916
Do you remember Valentina?

25
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:54,087
Our chambermaid in little Martinique?

26
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:55,622
We all thought she had just a cold,

27
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:56,990
until it was too late!

28
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:58,392
I'll never shake the mental image

29
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:01,664
of her frothing and
flailing in the water taxi!

30
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,124
I can still hear you!

31
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:06,117
We love you, Alexis!

32
00:01:06,142 --> 00:01:09,111
- Don't we?!
- We love you, Alexis.

33
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:10,650
Tell her you're gonna bring her the juice.

34
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:12,209
I am bringing the juice, Moira.

35
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:14,109
John, don't touch her.

36
00:01:14,463 --> 00:01:16,097
Ohhh...

37
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:19,731
This is as far as I go, Alexis.

38
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:22,327
One of us has to stay safe for David.

39
00:01:22,352 --> 00:01:23,752
I'm already in the room.

40
00:01:23,777 --> 00:01:25,693
See, we're still alive, Moira,

41
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,153
I think we're gonna be okay.

42
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,588
Of course you are, that's the spirit.

43
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:33,292
I'm just going to close
this door until you're done.

44
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,062
Sorry! I'm sorry!

45
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:40,679

46
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:52,576
Oh! Uh...

47
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:54,203
Do you like this sweater?

48
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:56,851
Honestly...

49
00:01:57,305 --> 00:01:59,807
While I admire your courage,

50
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:01,843
uh, when it comes to fashion,

51
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:03,703
I'm just not the best person to ask.

52
00:02:04,345 --> 00:02:05,713
- Okay.
- What's going on?

53
00:02:05,747 --> 00:02:07,335
Nothing.

54
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,545
- Mm, you seem stressy.
- I'm not. I'm not stressy.

55
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,656
I just want to make a
lasting impression, so...

56
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:17,124
It's a job interview?

57
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,693
For a "brand manager" position

58
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:20,594
at an upscale boutique.

59
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:22,007
In Elmdale?!

60
00:02:22,497 --> 00:02:24,064
Okay, there are certain lies I tell myself,

61
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:25,799
and if you're any kind of a friend,

62
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,301
you' will let me cling to those lies.

63
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:31,871
And, drive me to the interview.

64
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:34,140
So is this like, an either/or type thing?

65
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:37,640
Can I help you cling to lies,
and not drive you to Elmdale?

66
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:39,579
Okay, I'm gonna change my sweater,

67
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:41,875
and meet you at your car, so.

68
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:44,453
It's like a poncho.

69
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:49,122
So the guys says to me,

70
00:02:49,156 --> 00:02:52,671
"well, I wouldn't try that
with a fractured larynx!"

71
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,461
I wouldn't try that, period!

72
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:00,065
- Morning, boys.
- Hi, Johnny.

73
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,835
- Ahem!
- Oh man! Oh, boy.

74
00:03:05,138 --> 00:03:06,538
Well, if you gentlemen don't mind,

75
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:08,373
I'd like to start my day.

76
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:09,808
Yeah, me too, um...

77
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:11,554
Do you guys wanna see a card trick?

78
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:13,912
- Oh, I do. - Okay, first thing
I need is a deck of cards.

79
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:15,680
All right, you know what, I
hate to break up this party,

80
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:19,451
but this is my office, and I
do have a lot of work to do,

81
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,253
so up, Roland.

82
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:22,710
Your office?

83
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,723
Uh, well that's kind of
interesting, Johnny,

84
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:26,892
because I don't remember
seeing your application

85
00:03:26,926 --> 00:03:29,394
for a new business license.

86
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:30,828
Oh jeez!

87
00:03:30,863 --> 00:03:33,397
To be a fly on the wall
for this conversation!

88
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:35,179
Bob, you're in the room.

89
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:38,323
You know, Johnny, it's
kind of standard procedure

90
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:41,317
for new businesses to register.

91
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,807
But then again, I guess
you don't really have

92
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:44,809
a lot to register, do you?

93
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:48,712
Maybe not to you, Roland,

94
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:50,915
but keep in mind I did start Rose Video

95
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:52,917
with $2,000 dollars and a dream,

96
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:55,019
so it's all about planning.

97
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:56,788
I see it every day.

98
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:59,223
Lots of quiet planning.

99
00:03:59,258 --> 00:04:01,759
Sure, he treats himself to a muffin or two,

100
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:04,896
but uh, I get that that's
all part of the planning,

101
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,007
right, Johnny?

102
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:08,492
Could be.

103
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:11,234
Yeah, could be. I mean...

104
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:14,671
I could look at this muffin
and say, this is a fine muffin.

105
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:17,007
I'd kill for a bagel, but
I haven't seen one bagel

106
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,828
since I got to this town.

107
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,512
Now, back at Rose Video,
I used to get my assistant

108
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:23,367
to bring me a bagel every morning.

109
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:26,650
So I might think a bagel shop is something

110
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:28,118
this town could use.

111
00:04:28,152 --> 00:04:29,867
Oh, I love a good bagel, Johnny.

112
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,823
Do you-do you think that
idea really has legs?

113
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:36,126
Well, it's just an example, Bob.

114
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,829
Ooh, I just get chills
thinking that we're sitting

115
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:42,499
right in the middle of the
"Johnny Rose Dream Factory!"

116
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:44,301
Ooooh!

117
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:46,569
Stupid... baby.

118
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:50,506
I'll tell you what, Johnny,
instead of the license fee,

119
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,304
I'll just take a bite of your muffin.

120
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:55,045
Mmm! Good!

121
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,750
Mmmm! Mm! Mm!

122
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:02,016
I have to go to this
Jazzagals rehearsal, Alexis,

123
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,164
so I'll need your word
you'll remain stable.

124
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:08,132
We're a long way from any hospitals.

125
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,078
You can't be playing fast
and loose with those symptoms.

126
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:13,976
Alexis?

127
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:18,671
Alexis?!
- I'm sleeping!

128
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:21,328
Oh, honey!

129
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,132
Honey, I need to ask
you a serious question.

130
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,976
Has it gotten worse, or are
you just not wearing any makeup?

131
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,211
Your freaking out is not helping anything!

132
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,390
Well, I'm sorry, dear,

133
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:32,217
but you're the first one to get sick here,

134
00:05:32,242 --> 00:05:33,715
and I-I can't... I don't...

135
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,281
I appreciate your concern,

136
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,953
but it's only a cold, and
I just need to get better.

137
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:39,062
You're right.

138
00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:41,289
Do I have a fever, though?

139
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:44,546
- I don't know.
- Can you see?

140
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:50,432
Hmm. Ugh!

141
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,882
I think you have to do
it without the tissue.

142
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:00,256
You're right, okay, put
your hand up on the forehead.

143
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:02,248
Mom!

144
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:05,453
Oh God!

145
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:07,258
- It's warm!
- How warm?

146
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,684
I don't know Alexis, I'm not a nurse!

147
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:12,721
Though I played one once in a
lovely little production of "Harvey,"

148
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:14,687
but she worked in a mental institute.

149
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:18,305
I blame those late nights at the barn.

150
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:19,855
Cold air whistling in and out,

151
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,023
and you and Mutt not
wearing near enough clothing.

152
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,808
Everybody gets sick sometimes.

153
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,531
Speak for yourself!

154
00:06:28,537 --> 00:06:30,604
I'm sorry, Alexis, I'm
sorry I must leave you,

155
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,812
but... mummy's gotta fight for her solo.

156
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:37,037
Arghhhh!

157
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:45,529
No. Nope. No.

158
00:06:45,554 --> 00:06:47,585
- What?
- Well, this can't be it.

159
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,077
That's it.

160
00:06:49,102 --> 00:06:51,592
Can't you tell by how
upscale the boutique is?

161
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:52,993
Well, that's false advertising!

162
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:56,228
I've been in this boutique,
and nothing about it is upscale!

163
00:06:56,263 --> 00:06:58,698
How did you being in
this store ever happen?

164
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:01,078
I was with Roland, we
were shopping for Jocelyn.

165
00:07:02,585 --> 00:07:04,256
It's a long, frightening story.

166
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:06,014
Anyway, we can't be here, we need to go.

167
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,789
Why? What's the big deal?

168
00:07:07,814 --> 00:07:11,083
There is a solid chance I
may have insulted the owner.

169
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:13,680
Oh well, that doesn't sound
like something you'd do.

170
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:15,335
She has very questionable taste.

171
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,445
And I may or may not have
told her that to her face.

172
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,039
So there is no point in being
here, you can start the car.

173
00:07:22,064 --> 00:07:24,832
I didn't drive all the way out
here for you not to do this.

174
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:27,527
Also, this is probably the only job

175
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:29,617
in this town that you'll
ever be qualified for.

176
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:31,653
Okay, so do you want me to lead with that,

177
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:35,052
or hold it 'til the end,
and keep it as a surprise?

178
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:40,399
You know, Johnny...

179
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:46,164
I think you're really on to
something with this bagel idea.

180
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:49,824
Yeah, but Bob, as I said this morning,

181
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:51,550
it wasn't so much an idea,

182
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:54,046
as it was an example of an idea.

183
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,612
I see.

184
00:07:55,637 --> 00:07:59,429
Well, for example, if you
were to open a bagel shop,

185
00:07:59,863 --> 00:08:01,998
what would be the first
thing you'd need to do?

186
00:08:02,313 --> 00:08:04,896
Well offhand, I honestly don't know,

187
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:07,942
I suppose I'd start by finding a space.

188
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:10,768
And then I'd probably
source out a bagel oven,

189
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:14,330
and um, a bagel Baker.

190
00:08:14,355 --> 00:08:17,657
Sesame seeds? Gwen loves
the ones with sesame seeds.

191
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:19,182
Yeah well, whatever.

192
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:21,930
And then we get the blueberry cream cheese.

193
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:23,179
- Ooh!
- Yeah.

194
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:24,938
Listen Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm,

195
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,032
but even if this bagel
shop was a viable idea...

196
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:30,459
- Which I think it is.
- Fair enough.

197
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:34,437
But you still have...
Considerable overhead.

198
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:36,497
I mean, you wanna make
sure you're making...

199
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:39,190
Good bagels the real way.

200
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:40,783
Well,

201
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,679
You would certainly know how
to make them the real way,

202
00:08:44,826 --> 00:08:48,187
because you're uh... you...

203
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:52,609
- Jewish?
- I didn't know if I could say it.

204
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:57,351
But boy, do you all love your bagels!

205
00:08:57,851 --> 00:09:01,562
I mean I do too, and I'm not even uh...

206
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,699
Jewish. You can say it, Bob.

207
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:09,258
I don't know why,

208
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:10,968
it feels like a swear.

209
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,372
What's the one you can't say?

210
00:09:13,407 --> 00:09:15,207
Okay, you know what, I've
got a lot of work to do, Bob,

211
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:17,695
but thanks for stopping by.

212
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:27,986
So... David!

213
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:29,855
This is quite the resume.

214
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:33,695
If I ever need a performance
artist I know who to call.

215
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,085
- Thank you.
- Skanky!

216
00:09:37,764 --> 00:09:41,232
- Excuse me?
- You called my store skanky

217
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:43,828
when you were here with the mayor.

218
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,439
Mmm... mmhm.

219
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:48,840
Hmm.

220
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,876
Well, what I think I'd
bring to the position

221
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,579
is a worldly approach to merchandising,

222
00:09:54,613 --> 00:09:57,481
and sales tactics. We're not
over the skanky thing, are we?

223
00:09:57,515 --> 00:10:00,618
No, and I can't help but wonder,

224
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:03,320
why you'd wanna work in a
store you described as skanky!

225
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:05,255
I don't know if we need
to keep saying the word.

226
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,857
Skanky!

227
00:10:06,892 --> 00:10:10,203
Do you still think my
store is skanky, David?

228
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:14,865
Which is why I feel like I can help.

229
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,400
You think I need your help?!

230
00:10:16,434 --> 00:10:18,569
Well, I am answering an ad in the paper.

231
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:21,521
Well David, I am looking for a partner.

232
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:24,274
Someone who believes in my store.

233
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:27,209
Well, I can say with complete certainty

234
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:31,247
that I see literally nothing but potential.

235
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:32,951
In your store, you know?

236
00:10:32,992 --> 00:10:35,515
Is the floor overcrowded? Yeah.

237
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:37,787
Are the mannequins a little too busty?

238
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:39,388
Absolutely.

239
00:10:39,524 --> 00:10:41,624
Does it smell like urinal cakes in here?

240
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:43,159
Perhaps.

241
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:45,294
Well, this is all very constructive,

242
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:49,335
and it's clear you have some strong ideas.

243
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:53,569
It seems as though you have trouble

244
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:55,905
filtering negative thoughts.

245
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,409
So I don't know if I can trust you

246
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:03,015
to represent the "Blouse Barn."

247
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:06,215
Okay, well, this has been a treat.

248
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,953
Thank you so much.

249
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:11,053
I'll need to see you on the floor,

250
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,023
working with customers.

251
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:15,820
Okay.

252
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:29,726
- Can I help you?
- Bob want us to meet.

253
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,585
Bob wants us to meet?!

254
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:34,953
- Yeah, may I sit?
- No, no.

255
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:37,356
Hey there, Johnny.

256
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,957
- Bob?
- This is Ivan.

257
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:40,392
- Uh huh?
- Take a load off.

258
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:43,406
- Ah.
- Well... sure, sit. Sit down.

259
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:47,468
Ivan would like to help
with the uh, bagel idea.

260
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:50,302
Well, there's no bagel
- I mean, you know, Bob,

261
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:52,507
I already told you... I got some brick.

262
00:11:53,273 --> 00:11:55,406
You've got bricks? What bricks?

263
00:11:55,908 --> 00:11:57,226
- For bagel oven.
- Yeah.

264
00:11:57,744 --> 00:11:59,111
Ivan works down at the quarry,

265
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:01,579
he's got a whole truck filled with bricks.

266
00:12:01,614 --> 00:12:02,757
Right out front!

267
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:07,139
Bob, you know, this bagel
shop idea was just an idea.

268
00:12:07,486 --> 00:12:08,854
You know, it's not even an idea,

269
00:12:08,888 --> 00:12:13,812
it's just an illustration
of a theoretical idea.

270
00:12:13,837 --> 00:12:15,148
Well, that may be,

271
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:19,237
but do you know how
much a bagel oven costs?

272
00:12:19,632 --> 00:12:22,433
And Ivan here, he's
willing to do it for free.

273
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:25,336
- As long as I get to...
- As long as he gets to make the bagels.

274
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:28,656
- Yeah.
- Wow, well, no one is making any bagels.

275
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,876
- Right now.
- You want me to start unloading?

276
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,281
No, no unloading.

277
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:33,979
Ivan, would you excuse us for a minute?

278
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:36,570
I just wanna have a word with Bob.

279
00:12:36,595 --> 00:12:38,671
- Oh yeah, sure.
- Okay.

280
00:12:42,617 --> 00:12:45,290
Could you stand, and excuse us?

281
00:12:45,324 --> 00:12:46,398
All right, oh, okay.

282
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:47,789
I'll meet you out there in a minute.

283
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:51,015
Bob, you know, we are... so f...

284
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:53,554
Oh.

285
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:57,590
We are so far from even remotely having

286
00:12:57,615 --> 00:13:01,818
a conversation about
this... You know, business.

287
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,085
Yeah. Okay.

288
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:06,771
You said you started Rose Video

289
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:08,898
with $2,000 bucks and a dream.

290
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:12,722
I-Bob, you-you
don't have to...

291
00:13:12,803 --> 00:13:16,578
Let's turn this dream... Into green!

292
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:20,039
Bob, I don't want your check.

293
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:23,944
Oh my God.

294
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:38,154
- Ooh!
- Do you think I should get it?

295
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:40,787
Mm! That's a question.

296
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:42,612
- You don't like it.
- I never said that.

297
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:46,216
I never said that, I
feel... You know, in France,

298
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,257
they say the looser the fit,
the sexier the feel, so...

299
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:50,717
I've never been to France.

300
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:53,077
Okay, what if I pulled a few other options,

301
00:13:53,102 --> 00:13:56,235
and um, see what happens?

302
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,382
I'll be right back.

303
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:00,730
Hi! How much longer do you expect me

304
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:02,966
to wait in the car like
some hired chauffeur?!

305
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,046
Um, yeah, I'm gonna need
you to do something for me.

306
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:06,886
Like drive home without you?

307
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:10,013
Uh no, Wendy has got me
on a bit of a trial run

308
00:14:10,038 --> 00:14:12,639
with the customers, and I'm
gonna need you to help me out

309
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:14,232
by looking like you're
enjoying this conversation

310
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:15,906
a little more than you are,

311
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:19,210
um, I'm gonna need you to
buy a couple blouses from me.

312
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:21,890
- A couple?!
- One. A blouse.

313
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:27,289
- What about this?
- Well, that's not an option.

314
00:14:27,323 --> 00:14:30,468
- That-no. - But I have my
sister's communion this weekend.

315
00:14:31,228 --> 00:14:33,229
- Okay, don't do that.
- Don't do what?

316
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:34,687
Do you not like it? Don't, Stevie!

317
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:37,165
Good recommendation, sir!

318
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,179
This is gonna be a smash at
my husband's trial hearing.

319
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:42,679
He's got good taste.

320
00:14:42,704 --> 00:14:44,772
Okay, so I've pulled a few options.

321
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:46,197
Or we can go with what we have.

322
00:14:46,222 --> 00:14:48,357
- These are stupid.
- Okay.

323
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,760
Alexis?

324
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,091
The woman at the general
store said a girl in Elmdale

325
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:56,351
recently contracted avian flu.

326
00:14:56,376 --> 00:14:58,835
So I got you a bit of everything.

327
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:03,267
Oh... I see you're already
being taken care of.

328
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:04,421
Hello.

329
00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:07,068
I didn't realize you were
feeling well enough for company.

330
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:08,955
I just brought over a few things

331
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,500
to help break the fever.

332
00:15:10,658 --> 00:15:13,727
And it's really helping, thank you.

333
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,577
No, I-I'm relieved that Alexis has someone

334
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:20,004
with such natural care-giving tendencies.

335
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:24,312
- I'm gonna go.
- No babe, stay.

336
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:26,710
Had I known your spirits were so high,

337
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:30,605
I might not have spent the
last 45 minutes of my life

338
00:15:30,823 --> 00:15:33,925
running around buying cold medication.

339
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,884
I didn't ask you to go buy cold medication.

340
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:38,177
When have you ever bought
me cold medication?!

341
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:40,773
Exactly, I knew it didn't feel right.

342
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:44,058
I think you're in good hands now, babe.

343
00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:45,840
- No! -
Uh-huh.

344
00:15:45,865 --> 00:15:48,201
Oh dear, are we sure this
isn't just mono again?

345
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:50,394
What with your symptoms,
and your lifestyle?

346
00:15:50,502 --> 00:15:52,515
Mrs. Rose, I don't have mono.

347
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:54,728
Oh no offense dear, could be others.

348
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,854
- Oh my God!
- Get some rest.

349
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,601
- Bye.
- Bye.

350
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:03,773
Weren't you supposed
to be at choir practice?

351
00:16:03,813 --> 00:16:05,757
Rehearsal. Yes.

352
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:07,649
I supposed to be there over an hour ago.

353
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:08,812
So why aren't you?

354
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:12,773
Because I kept picturing
you diseased and all alone.

355
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:15,312
That's never stopped you before.

356
00:16:15,337 --> 00:16:16,770
I know!

357
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,718
What the hell is going on, Alexis!

358
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,765
I'm feeling something.
Something debilitating!

359
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:26,445
You're the ill one, but
I'm... I'm feeling this...

360
00:16:27,592 --> 00:16:30,360
- This...
- Maternal instinct, maybe?

361
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:33,216
No, that's not it.

362
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:34,709
No!

363
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:35,726
Maybe.

364
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:38,328
No!

365
00:16:44,156 --> 00:16:46,357
Have I offended you in some way, Johnny?

366
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:47,617
Probably.

367
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:51,779
I'm just wondering at what
point you decided to cut me out.

368
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:55,134
- Of what?
- Well, I assumed I would be consulted

369
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:57,369
before we made any major decisions

370
00:16:57,404 --> 00:16:59,625
- about the bagel business.
- What decisions?!

371
00:17:00,109 --> 00:17:02,607
Well, hiring Ivan for one thing,

372
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:04,601
I don't have good feeling about that guy.

373
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:06,515
I think he's ex-KGB.

374
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:10,265
Roland, there is no bagel business!

375
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:13,017
Okay, it was just a stupid idea I made up

376
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:14,853
because you were right.

377
00:17:14,878 --> 00:17:16,877
Well, I know that!

378
00:17:17,264 --> 00:17:18,698
Right about what?

379
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:20,958
About me not doing anything.

380
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,045
It's tough enough coming
up with a business idea,

381
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,413
let alone a money making
idea in a town this small,

382
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:29,345
and I was you know, putting
a lot of pressure on myself.

383
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:31,252
Maybe too much pressure.

384
00:17:31,921 --> 00:17:34,923
And I've been doing nothing
but... treading water.

385
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:40,846
So I... started rambling
about bagels this morning.

386
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:46,601
Look at this, the brain trust!

387
00:17:46,635 --> 00:17:48,836
So I was thinking, and uh,

388
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,244
I'm not married to it, but uh...

389
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:53,634
"Bob's Bagels."

390
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,377
Johnny, I think you have something

391
00:17:57,412 --> 00:17:59,150
you'd like to say to Bob.

392
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:01,447
You don't wanna use the name Bob?

393
00:18:01,717 --> 00:18:03,550
Oh, I get it,

394
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:06,587
go with something a
little more old testament?

395
00:18:06,622 --> 00:18:08,055
Bob that's not it, no.

396
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,400
See, there won't be a bagel shop.

397
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:12,919
'Cause I've looked into
it, and it's not feasible.

398
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:15,284
And there already is a
bagel shop in Elmdale.

399
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:16,764
But Ivan's about to hand in his notice

400
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:18,775
down at the quarry, and uh...

401
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,667
I gave you that check!

402
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:23,673
Yes and of course I'm-I'm returning...

403
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:25,648
This check to you.

404
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:29,642
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.
You took money from Bob?

405
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:33,247
- Why didn't you come to me?
- You would've given me money?

406
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:35,081
No, of course not, but as your partner...

407
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:38,033
You're not a partner! Not my partner.

408
00:18:38,423 --> 00:18:41,559
Look Bob, I appreciate all the
confidence you've shown in me.

409
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:44,119
I really do, and I promise you this:

410
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:47,980
I will come up with a...
better idea real soon.

411
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:50,096
You know, next time uh...

412
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:52,097
I should probably see a business plan

413
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:57,119
so I don't invest so much
in another uh, hollow scheme.

414
00:18:57,389 --> 00:18:59,924
Yeah, me too.

415
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:03,252
- You didn't invest.
- Yes, and whose fault is that?

416
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:06,337
Mm...

417
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:08,994
Well, congratulations.

418
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:11,717
Let me get the champagne.
You guys are gonna love it,

419
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,369
it's the same one we use to
celebrate my mom's divorces.

420
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,757
- Great...
- So how long before I can return this?

421
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,611
Oh, it's exchange or store credit only.

422
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:24,697
- That's funny.
- I'm not joking.

423
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:28,744
Well, I guess you're buying drinks tonight.

424
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:30,277
I can do that, that's fair.

425
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,822
And dinner.

426
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:34,215
- Okay.
- And if I feel like dessert...

427
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,384
It's a $12 dollar negligee
on a 2-for-1 promotion so...

428
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,913
Okay, I'll just drop
a little raisin in here

429
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,314
to release the bubbles.

430
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,916
Blechhh! That's no necessary!

431
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,080
Okay!

432
00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:49,337
Congratulations!

433
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,353
A whole raisin.

434
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,793
To your first job.

435
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,395
Ooh, my first job was actually
a gap kids campaign

436
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,830
when I was six.

437
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,228
- To your first job!
- Mm!

438
00:20:14,143 --> 00:20:15,033
So tired

439
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:17,041
- Yeah.
- Tell me a story.

440
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:20,166
- How about a song?
- No!

441
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,173
A story it is.

442
00:20:23,111 --> 00:20:25,079
Um...

443
00:20:25,238 --> 00:20:28,574
There once was a radiant young actress,

444
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:31,566
who dreamed of having two sons.

445
00:20:31,912 --> 00:20:34,579
The second of which would be named Alex.

446
00:20:34,614 --> 00:20:36,894
- I don't like this story.
- Shh!

447
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:40,685
Now it seems the vivacious
daytime Emmy nominee

448
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,588
was surprised by how taken she was

449
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:46,527
with this unanticipated daughter.

450
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:50,269
Mostly because she didn't cry
as much as the unmannerly son,

451
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:55,550
but also because she was
adventurous, carefree,

452
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,854
so beautiful.

453
00:20:57,879 --> 00:20:59,433
Just like her mother.

454
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,355
Alexis, you're on my arm.

455
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,394
Alexis, seriously. I can't feel it!

456
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:12,566
I can't-Alexis!
- Aah!

457
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,417
Go to sleep, dear.

458

459
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,019
Ray, I have always seen you

460
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:22,441
as a sensitive,

461
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:24,299
cultured man of the world.

462
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,175
Thank you.

463
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,500
And I'm sure your family

464
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:27,991
wanted more for you

465
00:21:28,194 --> 00:21:29,827
when they immigrated from...

466
00:21:29,852 --> 00:21:31,870
- Winnipeg.
- Winnipeg?

1
00:00:01,873 --> 00:00:04,381
Listen, I've gotta step out for a bit,

2
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:07,108
I told Stevie if she needed any help...

3
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:08,335
Well, where are you off to?

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,661
To pick up the motel coasters.

5
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:12,351
Oh, you were serious.

6
00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:13,910
Yeah, custom coasters

7
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:15,769
are a very effective marketing tool.

8
00:00:15,852 --> 00:00:19,100
Says who?! The guy who
invented custom beer cozies?

9
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,723
- Coasters work.
- Yes, the last thing we want to do

10
00:00:21,757 --> 00:00:23,792
is stain these exquisite table tops.

11
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:25,460
Moira, you're having a drink,

12
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:27,028
you glance down at your coaster,

13
00:00:27,063 --> 00:00:29,397
it says, "tweet us on Facebook!"

14
00:00:29,432 --> 00:00:30,966
Or uh, "leave us a review!"

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,934
And you say, yeah, yeah,

16
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,835
okay, I think I will.

17
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:37,138
Is that what it says?

18
00:00:37,173 --> 00:00:38,807
Yes David, that's what it says,

19
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:41,042
you're not the only one
with an online presence.

20
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:44,312
- No, no...
- Well, aren't you Mr. Futuristic!

21
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:46,289
Listen, we had samples made.

22
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:48,109
Take a look.

23
00:00:51,187 --> 00:00:52,521
There's no address on this.

24
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:53,955
Oh, wow!

25
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,414
Aren't we stuck in the Dark Ages.

26
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:59,429
Huh? Let me break it
down for you, junior.

27
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:02,931
If they're at the motel
using the coasters,

28
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:06,164
they don't need to
know where the motel is.

29
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:10,581
Um, I was referring to a web address.

30
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:12,703
Or a Twitter handle.

31
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,203
Oh.

32
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:16,921
Hmm, that might be something
you'd wanna put on there.

33
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:18,446
Or a Facebook page.

34
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:20,226
All right, let me write this down.

35
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:21,917
Or a hashtag.

36
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:23,518
A hashtag? Is that two words?

37
00:01:23,553 --> 00:01:24,920
No, it's not.

38

39
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:38,934
Hi, sorry to bother you.

40
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:40,669
I'm afraid Mr. Rose
has just stepped out,

41
00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:42,078
He's gone to get coasters.

42
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:44,937
Yeah, wait, he said that you
might be available to help.

43
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:47,475
- Did he?!
- It's just that we have um,

44
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,910
a bunch of guests checking in,

45
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:50,710
and I could really use some help.

46
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,718
- Now!
- Now?

47
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,984
Well then, I am here for you, Stevie.

48
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:57,452
Uh, let's see...

49
00:01:57,486 --> 00:02:00,859
something in a supervisory
capacity, perhaps?

50
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:03,959
Then you can work the front desk.

51
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:06,294
Ooh, receptionist work
is not my strong suit,

52
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,129
that's more Alexis' bailiwick.

53
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:10,765
The other option is changing the sheets,

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,453
and mattress covers.

55
00:02:14,095 --> 00:02:17,179
Then I shall keep watch
over this front desk.

56
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:27,046
Okay, I'll see you after lunch.

57
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:34,289
Alexis, do you mind
sticking around for a minute?

58
00:02:35,428 --> 00:02:36,631
Okay.

59
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:47,450
I'm assuming that you know
why I wanna talk to you today?

60
00:02:47,703 --> 00:02:49,738
Is it because I was texting in class?

61
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:51,139
Uh, nope.

62
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:52,968
I wanna talk about your paper.

63
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:55,276
There are parts of this that sound like

64
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:56,906
they've been written by someone else.

65
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,357
- Oh my God, thank you!
- No, no, no.

66
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:02,150
I'm saying that I
think it's plagiarized.

67
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:04,351
Are you sure you wrote this yourself?

68
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:05,964
Trust me, if I could've
gotten someone else

69
00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:07,822
to write this, I would've.

70
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:09,324
I definitely wrote this.

71
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:10,792
Okay, there are just parts of this

72
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:12,527
that make me think that's not true.

73
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:13,928
For example,

74
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:15,830
"we should begin by scrutinizing

75
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:17,732
the duplicitousness of such businesses,

76
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,567
whose practices, or lack thereof,

77
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:22,015
can only be described as untoward."

78
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:23,893
Duplicitousness?!

79
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:25,257
I can barely say that.

80
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,343
And untoward?

81
00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:28,977
Okay, yeah, no, I did not write this.

82
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,656
Can I see?

83
00:03:32,448 --> 00:03:34,416
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

84
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,093
Can you just look? Can... eyes, eyes!

85
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:39,721
Hi. You're gonna write a new paper,

86
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:42,190
and I am gonna grade that one instead.

87
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:44,062
Otherwise it's a fail.

88
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,912
Okay, like, I didn't
even choose this font!

89
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:49,499
It's horrible.

90
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:51,523
_

91
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,818
Okay, look at her.

92
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:56,858
But don't really look
at her, look at me.

93
00:03:57,073 --> 00:03:58,914
Look at her, and look at me.

94
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:01,476
Oh, that's good, that's good, closer.

95
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,554
Closer.

96
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:04,346
Yeah, we had an
appointment this morning.

97
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:07,382
Okay, here we go, one, two...

98
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,484
oh, that was good.

99
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:13,254
Uh remind me, are you
here for a photo series,

100
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:14,656
or travel planning,

101
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,257
or our newest service,

102
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:17,882
closet organization?

103
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,395
Um, I'm here to file
my incorporation papers

104
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:21,796
for my business.

105
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:23,843
Oh, that's right. Patrick!

106
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:27,093
Uh, B13.

107
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,495
Ah, this is for you.

108
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:31,506
- Patrick.
- David.

109
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,185
David Rose, you bought
the General Store.

110
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,343
Leased.

111
00:04:34,368 --> 00:04:36,102
Leased the General Store, yeah.

112
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,480
- That's a big deal.
- Is it?

113
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:39,914
Yeah, it's pretty big.

114
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,316
Yeah, you wanna have a seat?

115
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,928
Your parents tell me you're very sporty,

116
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:44,686
so Will, why don't you grab the paddle,

117
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,888
and Theresa, a badminton racket?

118
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:50,258
So, why don't we start with
the name of the business?

119
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:51,626
Oh um, I'm oscillating

120
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,027
between two names at the moment,

121
00:04:53,062 --> 00:04:54,439
so if we could just
leave that one blank,

122
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:56,898
- that would be great.
- Sure, sure.

123
00:04:56,932 --> 00:04:59,534
Give you more time to... oscillate.

124
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:01,773
Um, business address?

125
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:03,211
Okay, so I'm working on that.

126
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,083
Um, I'm currently staying in a motel,

127
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:06,852
and I think it might be
confusing if I gave you

128
00:05:06,876 --> 00:05:09,054
the address to another business.

129
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:11,546
Y-Yeah, for sure.

130
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,164
We'll leave that blank as well.

131
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:15,984
Battin' a thousand here, David.

132
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:18,531
I don't know what that means.

133
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:20,455
Hey, here's an easy one.

134
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:22,056
A brief description of the business.

135
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:23,591
Um well, it's-um,

136
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:25,126
it's a General Store,

137
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:27,095
but it's also a very specific store.

138
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:29,531
- Huh.
- And it's also not just a store,

139
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:32,000
it's like a place where
people can come and get coffee,

140
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:35,513
um, or drinks, but
it's not a coffee shop,

141
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:36,945
nor is it a bar.

142
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:40,108
Okay, so we're pretty
clear on what it's not.

143
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:42,162
Yeah, it's an environment. Um...

144
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:44,588
And yes, we will be selling things,

145
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:46,132
but it's more like...

146
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:49,227
more like a branded
immersive experience.

147
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:51,319
Right, I love the buzzwords, David,

148
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:54,195
but I do need to put
something down here.

149
00:05:54,356 --> 00:05:56,445
Okay, you couldn't use
anything I just said?

150
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,639
I'll tell you what. Why don't you
take these home with you,

151
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:02,140
and just fill them
out when you have a...

152
00:06:02,164 --> 00:06:04,843
a clearer idea of what you
want to do with your business.

153
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:06,453
Okay, um...

154
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,804
I do have a clear idea.

155
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,841
Oh! You've settled on a name, then?

156
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:15,410
Um... you're either very impatient,

157
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:17,554
or extremely sure of yourself.

158
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:19,658
I threw you a bit of
a change-up there, huh?

159
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:21,059
Yeah, again, I don't
know what that means,

160
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,450
I don't play cricket.

161
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,896
Look, take this, it's my card,

162
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:28,056
and I feel like you will need it.

163
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,525
Uh, you know what, I think I'm good.

164
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:33,161
Um, so thank you for this.

165
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:34,762
It's nice to meet you, David.

166
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:36,264
Yeah.

167
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:38,600
Okay Teresa, remember to breathe!

168
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,407
I'd like to check in, please.

169
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:48,676
Oh my God, where did you come from?

170
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:50,252
I said hello twice.

171
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:52,705
Well, hello, hello, then.

172
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:55,850
Here you go, room three.

173
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:57,919
Uh, don't you need my credit card?

174
00:06:57,953 --> 00:07:00,922
My associates will deal with
all that when you depart.

175
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:02,367
Also, how many beds are in the room?

176
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:03,721
Two.

177
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,693
Would it be possible to get a cot,

178
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:07,528
or a roll away bed put in the room?

179
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:09,931
Oh, you're expecting company?

180
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:12,533
No, I use it to lay out my clothes.

181
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:14,836
The chest of drawers should suffice, no?

182
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,672
I like to see all my clothes at once.

183
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:19,941
Might the other bed not do?

184
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:21,119
Yes...

185
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:23,678
Except I haven't decided
which bed to sleep in,

186
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:25,213
so that's tricky.

187
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:27,148
Really, the cot would be best.

188
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:29,284
- A cot it is, then.
- Thank you.

189
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:31,753
Oh, and are the pillows
feather, or foam?

190
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:33,955
- Yes.
- Sorry, which one?

191
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:35,590
- I don't care.
- I'm sorry?

192
00:07:35,624 --> 00:07:37,058
I don't know!

193
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:39,093
I'm not entirely versed on the contents

194
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:41,663
of the motel's pillow collection.

195
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:42,814
I was just asking.

196
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,499
And I'm very much looking forward

197
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:46,567
to the moment when that stops!

198
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:49,370
- Well!
- Enjoy your stay.

199
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:01,683
Oh hi, honey!

200
00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:03,073
How was school?

201
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:05,353
Um, not great.

202
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:08,122
Jocelyn failed my economics paper.

203
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:09,768
What?!

204
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:12,493
You worked so hard on that!

205
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:14,495
Yeah, which is why
it was super upsetting

206
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,378
when she said it wasn't good.

207
00:08:16,832 --> 00:08:19,801
- She what?
- Yeah, she said it was bad.

208
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:21,469
No, sorry, um...

209
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,589
"poorly written, and under-researched."

210
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:25,565
Well, that's just not true!

211
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:27,652
Well, you have to go
back and tell Jocelyn

212
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:29,043
that information was founded

213
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:31,620
on practical experience in the field!

214
00:08:31,814 --> 00:08:34,948
It should've been
founded on my research.

215
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:37,752
Oh, well yes, I'm sure...

216
00:08:37,786 --> 00:08:39,520
Well, your research was all over it.

217
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:41,055
Dad, what did you do to my paper?!

218
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,457
I didn't do anything!

219
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:43,931
I didn't do anything with your paper.

220
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:47,261
Your laptop was open, I did...

221
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:48,730
a little editing, nothing major.

222
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:50,865
I've been accused of plagiarism!

223
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,261
- What?
- Yeah!

224
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:57,848
Jocelyn thought I
cheated because "someone"

225
00:08:57,873 --> 00:09:00,241
used words like duplexity,

226
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:01,676
and backtowards!

227
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,378
- Untoward.
- Whatever!

228
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:05,056
And now I have to do
the whole thing again,

229
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,348
when my original paper was totally fine!

230
00:09:07,383 --> 00:09:09,017
Well, it wasn't totally fine, honey.

231
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:11,152
There was... questionable grammar,

232
00:09:11,186 --> 00:09:13,054
and a few spelling
mistakes, and I mean...

233
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:14,956
- Dad!
- All right, I'll back off.

234
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,324
Thank you!

235
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:17,859
Just out of curiosity,

236
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:20,495
did she... happen to say
anything about that quote

237
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,355
from Lee lacocca?

238
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:37,949
That's for you.

239
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:40,433
- Those are the clean sheets.
- No, I know.

240
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:44,673
Um, so I went to
incorporate earlier today,

241
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:47,009
and some guy basically told me

242
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:48,855
that my business was a failure.

243
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,400
- What?!
- Yeah!

244
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:55,233
- Who told you that?
- Some guy who's working at Ray's.

245
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:58,423
Some guy who's working at Ray's
told you your business was a failure?

246
00:09:58,448 --> 00:09:59,628
Basically, yeah.

247
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,874
Oh well, what did he say?

248
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:05,572
He told me to come back to him

249
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:08,384
once I had a clearer idea
of what my business was.

250
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,698
And then he told you it was a failure?

251
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,822
Well no, not like... Not exactly.

252
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,697
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to figure out

253
00:10:15,722 --> 00:10:17,666
when he called your business a failure.

254
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:20,392
Okay, maybe he didn't
call my business a failure,

255
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:23,128
- but it was insinuated.
- Okay.

256
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:28,800
So you know that I think
your business is a good idea,

257
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,931
and you know that I mean that,

258
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:33,425
because... I'm incapable
of faking sincerity.

259
00:10:33,956 --> 00:10:36,580
I'm also just incapable
of sincerity in general.

260
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:37,819
Okay, you know what, I'm
going through it right now,

261
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:39,621
and I actually think that
I might've been the one

262
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:42,580
that insinuated that my
business was a failure.

263
00:10:43,597 --> 00:10:46,394
Wait, you blew something
out of proportion?

264
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:47,862
No, what if he's right?

265
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:52,534
I am sitting on a big, empty space,

266
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,495
and I couldn't even tell him
what I wanted to do with it!

267
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,120
- You're freaking out.
- Uh...

268
00:10:57,145 --> 00:10:59,189
Because you know what you
wanna do with your business,

269
00:10:59,214 --> 00:11:02,150
you have walked me through
it one too many times.

270
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:05,183
So... he was probably
just trying to help.

271
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,944
No, I mean, he was very snippy.

272
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:09,980
Okay, um...

273
00:11:10,014 --> 00:11:12,425
I found this under the bed in room two,

274
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,318
so do you wanna take a break?

275
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:16,177
That's disgusting!

276
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:18,152
Uh, and yes. Yeah.

277
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:21,941
♪

278
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:54,809
Hi David, it's Patrick.

279
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,424
I um-was just calling
to run my business plan

280
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:03,318
uh, by you in a little more detail.

281
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:06,666
So feel free to give me a call back,

282
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:09,524
and I will be happy
to walk you through it.

283
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:11,214
Okay, ciao.

284
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:14,939
Ciao! I said ciao to that person.

285
00:12:14,964 --> 00:12:16,331
Hi Patrick,

286
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:18,566
Yeah, I think I... I
think I called you David.

287
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:20,535
Which that's not - that's not your name.

288
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:22,137
You can just delete that text,

289
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:24,673
the-the voice-mail
that I left you.

290
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:26,508
Um, just thought it might be a good idea

291
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:29,577
to give you some background
information about...

292
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:31,813
the-the store.

293
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:33,994
It's basically a General Store.

294
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,009
Um, that will support local artists

295
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:38,820
under the brand of the store,

296
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:41,289
which-which would
also be my brand-oh.

297
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:44,859
Sorry, I just got a text.

298
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:46,261
Oh God!

299
00:12:46,295 --> 00:12:47,870
Yeah, the text cut us off.

300
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:51,448
Oh my god!

301
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:56,809
Well, at least I finished my book.

302
00:12:57,073 --> 00:12:59,674
Moira, what happened this morning?

303
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,743
John, you'd be so proud of me.

304
00:13:01,777 --> 00:13:03,678
I manned that front desk with the vigor

305
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:06,245
of a wartime radio operator.

306
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:07,782
Really?!

307
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:09,718
I checked in one whole guest.

308
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:11,820
Answered his questions, and believe me,

309
00:13:11,854 --> 00:13:13,888
it was a laundry list!

310
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:16,491
I see, and is there any
chance you might've been...

311
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,667
a little brisk with this guest?

312
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:20,634
Not in the slightest.

313
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:22,530
It was a master class in patience.

314
00:13:22,565 --> 00:13:25,150
Moira, I just got an alert,

315
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:29,673
that someone has posted a
terrible review of this motel.

316
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:30,972
Oh no, John!

317
00:13:31,316 --> 00:13:33,666
Well dear, if I've learned
anything from the theater,

318
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:35,330
it's whatever they say,

319
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:36,945
you cannot take it personally.

320
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:40,070
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
this is not about me.

321
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:46,355
"I was served by an intimidating
woman at the front desk,

322
00:13:46,522 --> 00:13:49,973
with an unrecognizable accent,

323
00:13:49,998 --> 00:13:52,099
and scary-looking attire."

324
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:55,030
And what might this have to do with me?

325
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:58,728
- Moira?
- Oh, that...

326
00:13:58,753 --> 00:14:00,441
fussy little (Bleep)!

327
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,438
After niggling me with
relentless demands!

328
00:14:03,472 --> 00:14:05,306
It doesn't matter!

329
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:07,041
Our job is to welcome people,

330
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:08,676
to make them feel at home!

331
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:10,044
I did!

332
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,946
John, do you know a better hostess?

333
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,581
You're gonna have to talk to him!

334
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,228
- Apologize!
- You can't be serious!

335
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:19,056
Moira, one bad review
could sink this motel!

336
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:20,893
We had four good reviews,

337
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:23,086
and this just brought
down the whole average!

338
00:14:25,027 --> 00:14:26,386
Okay, John.

339
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:29,597
For you I will talk to
that odious little man,

340
00:14:29,632 --> 00:14:31,232
and set things straight.

341
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:32,768
- Good.
- But unlike him,

342
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:35,395
I will not hide behind the internet!

343
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:42,377
♪

344
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:49,659
Hi.

345
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:52,206
Um...

346
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:55,023
So I messed up my form.

347
00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:58,027
And I'm going to need another...

348
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:00,056
form from you.

349
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:02,980
Oh, okay.

350
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,702
What?

351
00:15:07,736 --> 00:15:10,104
Nothing, I'm just uh,

352
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,299
I'm so glad you made such
good use of my business card.

353
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:14,689
I'm sorry I didn't pick
up, I was at a thing.

354
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:15,910
Well, best you didn't.

355
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,166
But I got all your messages.

356
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:20,748
Ah, um, and just
listened to the first one,

357
00:15:20,783 --> 00:15:22,150
and then erased the rest?

358
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:23,551
- No, no, no, no.
- No?

359
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:24,986
No, I listened to all of them,

360
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,498
I kinda had to, to piece them together.

361
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:27,999
Actually, I played them
for a few friends of mine,

362
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:29,390
I was at a birthday party,

363
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:30,869
so there were a lot
of people weighing in.

364
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:32,393
Okay, um...

365
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:34,929
Just kidding, I didn't
play them for anybody.

366
00:15:34,964 --> 00:15:37,121
I thought the first few
were very humorous, David,

367
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:39,057
and then I lost interest.

368
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:42,604
I may have played them
here on speaker phone.

369
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:44,005
Okay.

370
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:46,207
Can I just get the
paperwork, and then I can...

371
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:47,719
You know, the good
thing about the messages

372
00:15:47,743 --> 00:15:49,387
was that I was able to
get enough information

373
00:15:49,411 --> 00:15:51,676
to fill out your forms.

374
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,101
Oh.

375
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,683
I wish I could remember.

376
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:58,052
It's a good idea, your business.

377
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:00,087
Re-branding local products and crafts,

378
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:01,589
it's very inventive.

379
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,459
- Thanks.
- And I like the name.

380
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,427
"Rose Apothecary," you know,

381
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:08,206
it's just pretentious enough.

382
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:10,899
Would we call that pretentious,

383
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:13,198
or... timeless?

384
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:16,971
So I'll call you when I hear something.

385
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:18,383
And hey, if I don't get a hold of you,

386
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:19,777
I'll just uh,

387
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:21,527
leave a message.

388
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:24,417
Okay, thanks.

389
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:27,081
Ciao!

390
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:42,530
Hard at it, huh?

391
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,484
Mhmm.

392
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,589
You know honey, I'm sorry.

393
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:53,241
I'm sorry for interfering,
I was only trying to help.

394
00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:55,486
Why couldn't you have helped
me cheat in private school,

395
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:56,878
like everyone else's parents?!

396
00:16:56,912 --> 00:16:59,681
Because I wasn't around to
help you cheat back then,

397
00:16:59,715 --> 00:17:01,237
and I regret it!

398
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:04,042
The not being around, I mean.

399
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:07,299
And I think that's part of the reason

400
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:09,666
I wanted to help you cheat this time.

401
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,950
Although...

402
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:14,128
I don't really consider it cheating.

403
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:15,763
Mmm. okay, well, it is.

404
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:18,600
It is, but is it...

405
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:22,408
really plagiarism to take
something your dad wrote,

406
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:24,900
and put it in your paper,
and claim it as your own?

407
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:27,175
Yes, that's exactly what it is.

408
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:28,948
Well...

409
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:30,845
I'm sorry.

410
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,902
And I may have
underestimated you before,

411
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:37,527
but that is certainly...
not the case now.

412
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:39,893
Thank you.

413
00:17:41,156 --> 00:17:43,684
And you know why, honey?
Because you're better...

414
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,370
"than" that.

415
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:47,441
Thank you.

416
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,669
N-No, you're better...

417
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:51,666
"than" that.

418
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,401
Okay, I'm better then that.

419
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:55,706
Not better then that, better...

420
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:57,715
than that.

421
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,784
Okay, I don't know what
you're talking about right now!

422
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:01,728
All right, well if
you don't want my help,

423
00:18:01,753 --> 00:18:03,511
"than" I guess I'll leave.

424
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:05,146
Okay, thank you!

425
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,902
Okay, I'll see you later... "than."

426
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:09,702
Bye!

427
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:15,262
Ugh!

428
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:24,308
Hi.

429
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,035
The drinks out of this
machine are very cold.

430
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:29,070
- Oh, good.
- Too cold.

431
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:30,938
When I hold them, they sting my hands.

432
00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:33,007
We'll have to find you some mittens.

433
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:35,112
I'm quite prone to frostbite.

434
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:37,573
I know you wrote that review.

435
00:18:38,144 --> 00:18:40,314
It's my responsibility
to relate my experience

436
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:42,517
- to other customers.
- Is it?

437
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:46,454
I didn't even mention that the hot
water runs brown for three seconds.

438
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:47,822
All right, I'll agree,

439
00:18:47,856 --> 00:18:49,957
this motel could use some improvements.

440
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:52,827
But your review will scare
off the guests we need

441
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,762
to afford those improvements.

442
00:18:54,797 --> 00:18:56,197
I was just being honest.

443
00:18:56,231 --> 00:18:57,448
I see.

444
00:18:57,968 --> 00:18:59,753
Then I suppose I should be honest.

445
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:03,753
My daughter married a man who
turned out to be her uncle.

446
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:05,506
I'm sorry?

447
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,658
The lowlife uncle she
believed to have been executed

448
00:19:08,683 --> 00:19:10,912
years before by the Indian cartel.

449
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:12,547
This is all on my ex-husband's side,

450
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:14,449
I'm good people, and so's my daughter.

451
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:16,918
She had nothing to do
with Raven's accident.

452
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,087
When the Bangalores
finally found Dagger,

453
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:20,706
and gave him what he deserved,

454
00:19:21,378 --> 00:19:23,324
they threatened to burn down the motel,

455
00:19:23,358 --> 00:19:25,526
and leave my pregnant baby penniless.

456
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,261
This motel?

457
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:30,228
She begged them to let
her keep this place,

458
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,934
and she promised them a cut
of the profits in return.

459
00:19:32,968 --> 00:19:34,836
They laughed, and left,

460
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,606
but not without first shaving
all her beautiful hair!

461
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:41,943
When people ask me, why do
you work here for nothing?

462
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:44,377
I tell them, this is my flesh and blood!

463
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:45,970
I do this for her!

464
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:48,783
Nothing! She is my everything!

465
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,886
Okay, wow, I had no idea.

466
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,554
I can take down that review.

467
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:54,922
- Oh, I...
- I'll take it down.

468
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:56,524
Oh, do what you must.

469
00:20:07,824 --> 00:20:09,291
Good morning, Roses.

470
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:11,560
I just wanted to pop by
to congratulate Alexis

471
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:13,496
on her economics paper.

472
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,831
Oh honey, that's great news!

473
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:18,300
Our little woman of academia!

474
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:20,213
I would love to read 
this economics paper.

475
00:20:20,237 --> 00:20:21,871
I will admit that your thesis

476
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:23,873
of "why shop in store
when you can buy online"

477
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:25,841
was a little off-topic,

478
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:27,643
but still a really fresh take.

479
00:20:27,677 --> 00:20:29,136
Thank you.

480
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,914
Well, look at you,
Alexis, acing your paper!

481
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:33,516
Oh, no, no, God no.

482
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,152
I gave her a solid C plus.

483
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:36,845
Oh, so she did write it herself.

484
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:38,621
It was a noticeable improvement

485
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:39,925
over the first paper.

486
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,350
Um well, I should hope so!

487
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,869
Well, m-maybe not a
noticeable improvement,

488
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:46,659
but um, a different improvement.

489
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:49,330

(Knocking)

3
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:13,994
Hi, Johnny. Can we come in for a moment?

4
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:15,395
Yes. Yes.

5
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:19,733
Thank you. Hello.

6
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:21,434
Oh, hi.

7
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:23,336
Is everything okay?

8
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:25,104
(Emotional) We've got some sad news.

9
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:28,975
Uh... someone very close has died.

10
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:31,844
- (Winces) Sorry.
- Oh...

11
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:34,147
You remember Bob?

12
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:37,150
No...

13
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:39,085
You broke into his cabin and had sex

14
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,155
while he and his wife
were in the next room.

15
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:44,256
Oh... (Realizing) That's Bob.

16
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,559
Yeah, Bob, who was on the town council.

17
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:49,162
He's on the town council,
yeah... Oh, Bob died?

18
00:00:49,196 --> 00:00:50,963
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

19
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:53,933
No. No, not Bob. Bob's brother, Carl, died.

20
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:58,805
(Awkward silence)

21
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:03,041
I don't know Carl.

22
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:05,811
We barely know Bob.

23
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:08,314
Carl thought so highly of you, Johnny.

24
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:11,483
Oh... really. Well, that's nice.

25
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:13,285
No, I honestly don't know the man.

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,688
Well, understandably, Bob is uh...

27
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:17,856
Pretty broken up by all of this

28
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,793
and he asked me to ask you
if you'd be willing to um...

29
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:25,731
be a pallbearer at Carl's funeral.

30
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:28,466
A pallbearer... Mm-hmm.

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,904
at Carl's funeral. Well, I don't, um...

32
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,741
I, you know, I-I'm flattered.

33
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:37,709
It's-it's quite
an honour to be-

34
00:01:37,744 --> 00:01:39,144
- I knew he would say yes.
- Yeah.

35
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:41,880
And-and normally I would... I would.

36
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:44,715
I-I-I, you know, but
my back. I have uh...

37
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,884
I... I-I have back issues.

38
00:01:46,918 --> 00:01:48,352
- Honey? You know, my back.
- What?

39
00:01:48,386 --> 00:01:49,586
- The thing with my back.
- Your back!

40
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:52,389
Oh, it's... it's terrible.

41
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:56,260
And his arms are so weak.
Little muscles like corn nuts.

42
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:58,262
Yeah, yeah, we're just talking
about my back, sweetheart.

43
00:01:58,296 --> 00:02:00,530
It's awful.

44
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:02,466
I don't know what we're gonna tell Bob.

45
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,236
He's gonna be so disappointed.

46
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,571
Yeah... yeah. Well, life can
kick you in the teeth sometimes.

47
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:12,008
Mm. Well, that's not gonna help
Bob out too much there, Johnny.

48
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:14,043
Mm. Yeah. Shouldn't bother Carl.

00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,964
(Car doors open and close)

52
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:37,766
(Bottles clatter)

53
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:39,921
(Screaming) I said bring
the goddamn diaper bag!

54
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:42,871
Uh, babe, I'm getting the cooler right now

55
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:44,439
in case you didn't notice.

56
00:02:44,473 --> 00:02:45,640
Well, Denim has needed a diaper change

57
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:47,475
since before we left the house!

58
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,077
Oh my God.

59
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:50,879
What?

60
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:53,881
Some townie douchebag
is moving in next door.

61
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:57,618
They've got a baby.

62
00:02:57,652 --> 00:02:58,219
(Loud blast outside,
David gasps, terrified)

63
00:02:58,253 --> 00:02:59,553
Agh! (Gasps)

64
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:00,955
Is there a gun?

65
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:02,423
(Baby wails)

66
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:03,590
(Frustrated scream)

67
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,993
(Bottle crashes and shatters)

68
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:07,228
- Oh... no.
- Jesus! What the hell did you

69
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:09,030
- throw that for?!
- It's still too hot.

70
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,065
It's 20 seconds in the microwave
not 20 minutes, you tool!

71
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,200
You've lost it. You've lost it.

72
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,002
What the hell are you so rattled about?

73
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:19,539
(Bag thumps loudly, baby wails outside)

74
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:21,842
- What are you doing?
- Um, I'm gonna go stay at Ted's

75
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:23,676
because I've been on enough spring breaks

76
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:27,513
to know how this is gonna
end, and it's not... not good.

77
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:29,782
You're just gonna leave
me here with these people?!

78
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:31,751
Yeah. Like I don't feel good about it.

79
00:03:31,785 --> 00:03:34,387
Um, hello! Hello!

80
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:36,756
Is anybody in that hollow chest?

81
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,358
(Baby wails outside)

82
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:41,293
(Birds chirp)

83
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:43,563
(Door opens, door bells jingle)

84
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:49,935
Hey, Bob. How are you holding up?

85
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,904
Oh... you know. Not bad.

86
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:56,175
You know, they say death is just life

87
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:58,377
except you're not here.

88
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:01,146
You're somewhere else, you know? But...

89
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:03,815
But that's okay because
at least you're somewhere,

90
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,984
you know? But when does...

91
00:04:05,018 --> 00:04:07,219
When does somewhere become there?

92
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:09,388
And when does there become here?

93
00:04:09,422 --> 00:04:10,655
- And I... it
- Just, just a coffee, please.

94
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,390
- For here?
- Yeah.

95
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:12,424
Okay.

96
00:04:14,593 --> 00:04:17,828
(Music plays quietly,
dishes and cutlery clink)

97
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:22,100
(Gasps) Bob.

98
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:24,769
- Hi, Johnny.
- Oh, hi... hi.

99
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:27,138
You mind if I join you?

100
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:28,873
I could use a little company today.

101
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:31,509
Oh, no, no. You-you stay where you are

102
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:34,712
and I'll... I'll come over there.

103
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:36,213
(Grimacing and grunting) Oh! Ooh, baby.

104
00:04:36,247 --> 00:04:37,782
Ooh, wow. Ugh.

105
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:44,789
Yikes! That's... That hurts today.

106
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:48,258
Yeah, Roland, he told me
about your back and I...

107
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:50,227
I am so sorry.

108
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:52,662
Well... well, I'm the one who's sorry, Bob.

109
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:56,800
You know, hearing about your,
uh, brother... C-C-Chris-

110
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:59,002
- Carl.
- Carl. Yeah, he was a good man.

111
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:00,703
A good man. He admired you, Johnny.

112
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:01,805
And I him. Yeah.

113
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,640
And I him.

114
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:05,875
Listen, uh, I understand about your back...

115
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,978
Yeah... (Grimaces)

116
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:11,181
And... I was just uh.. Just wondering

117
00:05:11,215 --> 00:05:14,250
if, uh, maybe you could say
a few words at the funeral?

118
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:16,920
(Coughs)

119
00:05:16,954 --> 00:05:19,322
Well, the thing, uh, the thing is, uh, Bob,

120
00:05:19,356 --> 00:05:22,559
I-I-I don't feel I
deserve that... honor.

121
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:26,028
Oh, see, I'm uh... I'm
no good at these things.

122
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:29,231
You know, you, you're... You're polished.

123
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:31,100
You know, you're... You're well-spoken.

124
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:33,069
Oh no. No, no. Not really. Not really.

125
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:35,605
I mean, I'm good one on one,

126
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,539
but not-not good in a public situation.

127
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:38,941
I clam up pret-pretty good.

128
00:05:38,976 --> 00:05:41,143
As a favor, Johnny.

129
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:43,245
He must have had a few close friends,

130
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,515
- somebody that
- No one.

131
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:49,452
Well, sure. Sure. I can
say a few words, Bob.

132
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:52,721
I'll say a few words.

133
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:55,824
(Music plays quietly,
approaching footsteps)

134
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:58,494
Have you seen the couple that checked in?

135
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:02,531
They're like really scummy.
Like... very skaggy people,

136
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:05,400
who happened to produce a child

137
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:07,302
that hasn't been taken away from them yet.

138
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:08,871
Imagine being related to them.

139
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:10,639
No, I can't. It's too early.

140
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:15,210
- They're my cousins.
- Oh! Well, the um...

141
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:17,545
The baby's relatively normal looking.

142
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:18,946
No, no they're definitely skaggy.

143
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:22,282
My God, they're so skaggy.

144
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:24,418
Hmm. Wait, so you're related to Carl?

145
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:26,654
Not genetically.

146
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:30,090
My mom's sister was married to
Carl. Carl is Sean's step-dad.

147
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,526
And was that a factor
in the cause of death?

148
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,094
I wouldn't be surprised.

149
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:36,530
They broke up just before
Sean got Bree pregnant.

150
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,999
Or someone got Bree pregnant.

151
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:41,034
I mean, Bree's not exactly fussy

152
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,037
when it comes to introducing
men to her vagina.

153
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,471
Mm. Charming.

154
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:48,241
(Car rumbles by)

155
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,877
(Bag thumps on chair)

156
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:53,947
Tell me it's not always this clean in here.

157
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:55,015
No, it's-it's always this clean.

158
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,716
Oh... it smells so fresh!

159
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,585
Uh... that's the Febreeze.

160
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,787
I was... I was eating
Indian last night, so...

161
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,323
So much better than the motel.

162
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:07,026
At least you know what the smell is.

163
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:08,994
(Squeals happily)

164
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,029
(Kissing)

165
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,100
(Paws skitter across on floor)

166
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,900
Oh, ho-oh! Oh... (Laughs)

167
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,002
Hey, come on now, you two, Oh, hi! Hi.

168
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,638
- Come on.
- Hi there. Ooh!

169
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:24,042
Oh-ho-ho... there's a good
girl. There's a good girl!

170
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:27,845
- They're so...
- Well, Macy and Fifer are just staying with me

171
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,314
for a couple of weeks until
they get back on their feet.

172
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,283
Isn't that right, Fifey?

173
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,518
Yeah, your worms are almost
all gone, aren't they?

174
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,419
Yeah...

175
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,521
Is that a diaper on that little cutie?

176
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:40,691
Yup. Oh! You know what though? Whoa
-'kay. This is just...

177
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:42,759
This is because she's...
She's... She's scared right now.

178
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:44,295
But don't worry.

179
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,330
I can tell that you
are gonna win them over.

180
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:48,566
- Yeah... ?
- Yeah.

181
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,935
I just-I haven't um...
been... I haven't-I don't-

182
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,769
I'm not around dogs a lot,
so... (Laughs nervously)

183
00:07:53,804 --> 00:07:54,670
No, you know what? Don't even worry about.

184
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:56,906
Just... for tonight,

185
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,476
think of them as... our kids. (Dogs pant)

186
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,378
Right? Oh yeah...

187
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:04,481
John, you're speaking at the funeral?

188
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:07,217
The man was weeping.
What was I supposed to do?

189
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:08,884
You take his hands in yours,

190
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:12,154
you look him in the eye, and say, "no."

191
00:08:12,188 --> 00:08:14,823
What do you say about guy
you couldn't care less about?

192
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:17,593
Oh, it's Gord what's-his-name's
funeral all over again.

193
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:18,827
- Who's Gord
what's-his-name? - Exactly.

194
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:21,430
He was some kind of
crew-person on Sunrise Bay.

195
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:24,833
I made an obligatory
appearance at the service

196
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:27,503
and his hysterical girlfriend
cornered me into saying a few words.

197
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:28,897
I didn't have a thought in my head,

198
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:30,472
so I just stood up and sang "Danny Boy."

199
00:08:30,507 --> 00:08:31,839
Not a dry eye in the house.

200
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:32,906
Huh...

201
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:35,676
(Crickets chirp)

202
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,345
God, I love this bed.

203
00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:42,550
I'm so glad you're not my brother.

204
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:45,453
Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty glad about that too.

205
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:48,489
But let me assure you,
tonight it is just you and me.

206
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:49,723
(Happy sigh)

207
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:51,058
(Kissing)

208
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:57,096
(Playful giggle, gasping)

209
00:08:57,131 --> 00:09:00,667
(Kissing)

210
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:02,602
(Panting) Um...

211
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:05,838
Hey, the little guy is looking at us.

212
00:09:05,873 --> 00:09:09,209
Oh, yeah, dogs sometimes do that.

213
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:10,910
(Kissing)

214
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:14,314
(Panting)

215
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,421
Um... maybe we could
invite it to... go? Go away.

216
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:23,723
Oh, she's fine. She's fine. She's fine.

217
00:09:23,757 --> 00:09:25,524
(Kissing)

218
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,994
(Collar jingles)

219
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:31,163
Oh, now you want in on
the action, too, huh?

220
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:34,800
Okay, the... the big one
is sniffing the diaper.

221
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,534
Does... does that mean it's full?

222
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:38,103
- Okay.
- What is... ?

223
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:40,939
Okay, you guys, just give
us a little bit of time here

224
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:44,209
and then you can come
sleep with us, okay? Okay?

225
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:46,044
Okay, where were we?

226
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:47,713
- Hmm...
- Mm...

227
00:09:47,747 --> 00:09:50,215
(Kissing, dogs start growling)

228
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:52,483
(Barking)

229
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:55,153
(Mouthing) Out! Out!

230
00:09:55,188 --> 00:09:58,388
(Dogs continue barking)

231
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:01,826
(Loud rock music plays,
people chatter and laugh)

232
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,961
Pass the chips!

233
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:06,363
(Beer bottles clink)

234
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,298
(Knocking) Hello. Excuse me.

235
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,499
(Loudly) Excuse me!

236
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:10,901
- Hey!
- Excuse me!

237
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:13,170
- Hey! Go.
- Excuse me, hi.

238
00:10:13,205 --> 00:10:14,872
Oh, Buttons,

239
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,540
I don't think you're
invited to this one, huh?

240
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,474
I don't wanna be invited to this one.

241
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:19,743
(Laughing) Hey, look
who it is. It's your dad.

242
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:21,211
- He's here to take you home!
- Yeah, yeah...

243
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,813
- Remember that?!
- Yeah! (Laughs)

244
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:24,547
You remember that one?! (Laughing)

245
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:27,083
No.

246
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:29,152
- I'm just pumpin' your tires, bud!
- Okay.

247
00:10:29,186 --> 00:10:31,020
Look, what you gotta understand

248
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:33,322
is that my ex-stepdad just died,

249
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:35,859
so we're here celebrating his life, okay?

250
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:38,261
Okay, you all seem very devastated by this.

251
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:40,296
I need you to turn-mm.

252
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,866
I need you to turn the music down, okay?

253
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,536
Because I-I'm trying to get
couple hours... Sleep tonight.

254
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:50,906
Oh, sleep? Well, you know
who's sleeping forever, bud?

255
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,642
- Your ex-stepdad, yeah.
- My ex-stepdad, yeah.

256
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:55,210
- Yup, yeah.
- Damn, that's sad...

257
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:57,012
- Okay, thank you. If you could just turn it..
- Are we out of mix?

258
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:58,713
Thank you.

259
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:03,152
Oh my God.

260
00:11:03,186 --> 00:11:04,552
(Drunkenly) Don't...

261
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:08,556
Oh my... (Mouths) Oh my God!

262
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:10,025
I am so sorry. They got me...

263
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:13,395
(Drunk whisper) They got me wasted.

264
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:15,264
- Mm-hmm. - I
hate them, okay?

265
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:17,432
I hate them so much.

266
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:21,035
You smell... very flammable right now.

267
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:23,337
Yes, I'm sure...

268
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:27,374
I'm gonna need you to get
them to turn it down, okay?

269
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:29,177
- Yes!
- Yeah.

270
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:31,345
(Music plays loudly, Sean laughs)

271
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:34,615
- Hi, Denim.
- Hi, sweetie pie.

272
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:36,550
David, I so sorry.

273
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:51,024
- Johnny.
- Hello, Bob.

274
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,659
Moira, so good of you to come.

275
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:56,596
John said we had no choice.

276
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,031
Listen, we have some good seats down front.

277
00:11:58,065 --> 00:11:59,185
Oh, that's very nice.

278
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:05,337
Boy, what a beautiful day for a... funeral.

279
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:11,243
(Low murmurs, organ music plays)

280
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,408
Bob... in case I wanna
mention this in my remarks,

281
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:20,775
how-how did Carl go?

282
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,246
Well, it was a bit of a
freak accident, really.

283
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,615
Apparently, he was trying to
unhook his belt from the ceiling fan

284
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,086
and... apparently it... It
got knotted around his neck.

285
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,854
(Alarmed) What?

286
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:34,156
Yeah, you know, you'd think the whole thing

287
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,391
would've come down, you know,

288
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:41,662
keeping a fan and a body
spinning up there for two days.

289
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:45,032
But uh... Carl found the studs on that one.

290
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:46,867
Oh...  Yeah... (Chuckles)

291
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:47,969
That's craftsmanship.

292
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:50,104
Oh, yeah.

293
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:53,007
But that uh... That was Carl.

294
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,309
(Organ music plays,
mourners murmur quietly)

295
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,947
(Birds chirp)

296
00:13:00,982 --> 00:13:03,483
Do you even know what that stain is or... ?

297
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:06,386
Uh... I'm worried if I
did, I wouldn't clean it up.

298
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,257
Why are you cleaning it up?

299
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:16,029
Sadly, um, I threw most of
the broken glass you see here.

300
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:18,097
You were a bit of a mess last night.

301
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,831
They told you?

302
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,968
Oh, no, no. We had a
full-blown conversation.

303
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,537
You were barely clinging to consciousness.

304
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,572
Oh. Sorry.

305
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,877
Did I try and make out with you?

306
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,746
- Mm-mm.
- Good.

307
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,149
But now I'm worried I
made out with someone else.

308
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,551
Uh, it's kind of my go-to
when I'm a little boozy.

309
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:43,287
Mm. Mine's shame eating,
so yours sounds more fun.

310
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,089
(Laughs)

311
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,590
Huh. (Chuckles)

312
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,227
Um...

313
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,062
Is this your thong or... ?

314
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:55,233
Yeah, no. Bree's a real classy girl.

315
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,535
Uh, his was wrapped around the remote.

316
00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:59,170
Don't worry, I threw out the remote.

317
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:00,638
Hmm.

318
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,508
Well, it looks like
they have a side hustle.

319
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,945
Uh, I'm pretty sure she strips. Why?

320
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:10,113
Oh no, this is just a lot of um...

321
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:13,283
- Yes, it is.
- Marijuana. (Sniffs)

322
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,586
And if you're offering, my answer is yes.

323
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,021
(Bag rustles)

324
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:24,528
Thank you for that, Shannon.

325
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:28,097
Nothing says we'll miss you like
an excerpt from "Breaking Dawn,"

326
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:30,466
one of Carl's favourites
of the Twilight movies.

327
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,634
(Mourner cries, baby wails)

328
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:34,303
Now, to say a few words,

329
00:14:34,337 --> 00:14:36,272
I'd like to bring up a close friend

330
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,140
and one of Carl's personal heroes...

331
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:39,943
(Baby wails)

332
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:41,510
Johnny Rose. (Mourners clap and murmur)

333
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:46,848
(Baby wails, mourner coughs)

334
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:51,587
Thank you... minister.

335
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:57,059
Carl...

336
00:14:57,093 --> 00:14:58,526
What to say about Carl... ?

337
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:04,299
Once so full of life

338
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,735
and now... lying... very, very close to me.

339
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:11,706
What a terrible thing death is...

340
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:17,078
And yet, for Carl,

341
00:15:17,112 --> 00:15:19,113
pretty much an all-consuming
thing at this point.

342
00:15:19,147 --> 00:15:21,048
(Mourner cries)

343
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,084
He-he was a- he was
a man who loved...

344
00:15:25,186 --> 00:15:26,553
A good sweater I'm told.

345
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:31,558
And-and he loved the feel
of big tool in his hand,

346
00:15:31,593 --> 00:15:34,161
am I right, Bob?

347
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:36,563
And I wonder,

348
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:40,199
when Carl was spinning
around on that ceiling fan

349
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:42,935
that he was so very proud of,

350
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:46,539
was he ever thinking of this town...

351
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:49,342
where he was born where he lived,

352
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:51,477
and where he died... Where he died.

353
00:15:55,382 --> 00:15:58,484
But I-I-I'm not
up here today

354
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,720
to speak about dying in Schitt's Creek.

355
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:06,991
(Cell phone rings)
I'm-I'm here-I'm-

356
00:16:07,026 --> 00:16:09,327
(Phone beeps on) (Bleep!)
Where the hell are you, Sean?!

357
00:16:09,362 --> 00:16:11,630
At a bar?!

358
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:13,298
If anyone should be in
a bar right now, it's me.

359
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:14,732

360
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:17,169
(Bleep) Sean! (Mourners gasp)

361
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:21,540
(Baby wails) Excuse me.

362
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:25,075
Well... I-I am here to talk
about dying in Schitt's Creek!

363
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,679
I'm here to talk about the
misery of our lives here

364
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:31,715
and how we might never escape this place,

365
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:34,652
and how we do not wanna end
up in a coffin, like Carl,

366
00:16:34,686 --> 00:16:37,754

373
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:11,220
So... I'm sorry

374
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:15,290
if, earlier, I wasn't
sensitive to your animal issues.

375
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,060
And if it's any consolation,
the dogs told me to tell you

376
00:17:18,095 --> 00:17:22,331
that they're super embarrassed
about their behaviour, too.

377
00:17:22,365 --> 00:17:25,767
Well, I am dating a vet.
I should've known that...

378
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:28,136
There'd be slutty little
animals running around.

379
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,004
And I only take in the slutty ones, so...

380
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,672
(Laughs)

381
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:33,374
I just... I didn't know what to do

382
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:36,377
because I love the dogs so much, but...

383
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:40,949
You know, I also really love...

384
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:45,653
The way that our relationship
is going right now... so much.

385
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:48,155
Mm... such a sweet face. (Both laugh)

386
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:50,691
So, to get you more
comfortable around animals...

387
00:17:50,726 --> 00:17:52,693
Not a puppy, Ted! I...

388
00:17:52,728 --> 00:17:54,328
No, that would be cruel to the puppy.

389
00:17:54,363 --> 00:17:56,697
No, I got you... this.

390
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:01,969
"Opening your heart to
animals: A guide to the benefits

391
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:05,038
of caring for something
other than yourself."

392
00:18:05,073 --> 00:18:06,774
It's a very specific book.

393
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:09,843
You might wanna check out page 37.

394
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:10,878

395
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:14,681
(Whispers excitedly) Is it a credit card?

396
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:17,651
No. It's a room key...

397
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:20,320
To the premium king suite

398
00:18:20,354 --> 00:18:22,389
at the Holiday Inn Express in Elmdale,

399
00:18:22,423 --> 00:18:25,125
and they have a very strict
no pets allowed policy.

400
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,660
Well... it just so happens

401
00:18:27,694 --> 00:18:30,062
that I have packed my overnight bag.

402
00:18:30,097 --> 00:18:32,165
- Hmm.
- Come here.

403
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:35,101
(Kiss)

404
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,702
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

405
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:38,137
- No. Thank you!
- Thank you.

406

You know where I got my hat, brah?

410
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:47,179
Where?

(Car doors bang shut outside) Oh! Ow!

415
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:01,759
(Baby wails outside) Oh! Oh my God.

416
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:03,829
Oh my God! We need to go.

417
00:19:03,863 --> 00:19:05,830
We need to go! We need to go!

418
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,400
(Panicked whisper) I don't
see it... I don't see it.

419
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:11,501
- Let me see
it- - Shhh...

420

(Keys jingle, lock tumbles)

The (Bleep)?!

424
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:21,651
Shhhhhh!  (Stifled laughter)

425
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:27,784
(Whispering) My hat.. I'm wearing it.

426
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:29,052
I'm wearing it...

427
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,753

(Kissing, Stevie slams into door)

430
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:38,033
(Beer bottle scrape door,
Stevie grunts softly)

431
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:41,464
(Panting and kissing)

432
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:44,767
(Crash)

433
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,344
So I'm thinking to myself,

434
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:57,814
"Oh, God, what if die here?"

435
00:19:57,848 --> 00:20:01,184
Mm. That was not lost on anyone.

436
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:03,152
Uh, let's pilfer a few sandwiches

437
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:04,753
and make a gracious French exit.

438
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,588
Good idea.

439
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:14,661
Moira! Your "Danny Boy"... What a voice.

440
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,665
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

441
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,834
I-I'd really like you to
sing at my cousin's funeral.

442
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,336
She's not dead, but...

443
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,372
She's been coughing a lot lately.

444
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:25,808
Moira, before they close the coffin,

445
00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:28,210
One more chorus for Carl?

446
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:30,511
Please?

447
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:31,912

1
00:00:06,957 --> 00:00:09,916
Agghhhhhh! (Bleep) me! (Bleep) me!

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,582
- What?
- (Bleep) me!

3
00:00:11,617 --> 00:00:13,651
- What?
- John, there's something in the bed!

4
00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:15,086
- What?
- Something crawled up my leg and I can't see it!

5
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:16,822
- What?
- I can't see it!

6
00:00:16,856 --> 00:00:18,790
- A spider?
- No! Something invisible like...

7
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:22,393
Lice, or scabies, or... bed bugs!

8
00:00:22,428 --> 00:00:23,561
Oh, we don't have bed bugs.

9
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:26,131
Oh, John, I can't afford
to burn all my clothes!

10
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:28,050
Oh, Moira, relax.

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,635
Just relax. If we had lice, I'd have lice!

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,643
Guess who?

13
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,393
Deedee?!

14
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:39,033
- Hi, Momo.
- What the hell?

15
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:41,525
Sorry. I know I should've
called, but um... I just thought

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,961
it'd be really fun to
come see my older sister

17
00:00:44,996 --> 00:00:49,300
in her... new digs. You
know, a little visit.

18
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:51,767
Oh. Um... do you really have lice?

19
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:54,073
I'd hate to contract... lice.

20
00:00:54,098 --> 00:01:03,322
- Synced the_foe for Misia

21
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:09,288
So, Deedee, you are... looking well.

22
00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:12,315
Seaweed facials. I get one every week.

23
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:14,650
But enough about me, I
wanna talk about you guys.

24
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:17,419
Mm. I want you to know that I...

25
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:20,156
Really wanted to come and visit you

26
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,690
when I heard about your life collapsing,

27
00:01:21,724 --> 00:01:23,926
but I got this really big
job promotion that week

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,761
and things got, you know, kinda crazy.

29
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:27,963
Plus, we haven't really seen
much of each other recently.

30
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:30,832
Yes, well, we've had kind of a hectic year.

31
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:32,767
Well, thank goodness for the Internet!

32
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:34,236
Seemed to be the only thing letting me know

33
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,937
you two were still alive.

34
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,739
Telephone is also amazing!

35
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:39,407
You just push the buttons and say,

36
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:42,543
"Hi, it's me, your deadbeat sister."

37
00:01:42,578 --> 00:01:45,313
Well, it's a treat seeing
you two going at it again.

38
00:01:45,347 --> 00:01:46,881
Kids!

39
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,983
Come in and say hi to your aunt Deedee!

40
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:51,953
Better hurry before she
disappears for another decade.

41
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:55,022
Oh! What?

42
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:58,258
Look at you guys! You've grown!

43
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:00,160
Why did I think that you were dead?

44
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:02,395
Ah, you're so sweet.

45
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,865
Now how long has it been
since we've seen each other?

46
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:06,466
I think you crashed one of my pool parties

47
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,569
with some guy you were
calling "Uncle Julio."

48
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:11,694
Oh!  I remember that.

49
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,274
All right, you guys treat yourself, okay?

50
00:02:15,308 --> 00:02:17,343
Buy yourself something nice.

51
00:02:17,377 --> 00:02:18,745
- A hundred dollars?! Oh my goodness, wow.
- Oh my God! Oh my God,

52
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:21,714
I missed you! I missed you so much!

53
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:23,850
I missed you so much!

54
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:27,419
Oh gosh, look at that. They are sweet kids!

55
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:29,359
I don't know what you were
so worried about, Moira.

56
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:31,385
Deedee, what are you doing here?

57
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,021
Are you staying here at the motel?

58
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:34,888
Can I... get you a room?

59
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:37,557
No. God no.

60
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:40,694
No, I mean... no, I... I booked
myself into a junior suite

61
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:42,529
at the Comfort Inn in Elmdale, thank you.

62
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,643
This is very darling, it's
just it doesn't have a gym

63
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,066
and I'm kind of in the best
shape of my life right now

64
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:47,417
and I kinda wanna keep it that way.

65
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:49,003
Okay.

66
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:56,743
Okay, so you're saying that I
would be as in shape as you are

67
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,044
if I just fixed lights all day?

68
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,646
Pretty much.

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,874
Well... a few pull ups here and there.

70
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:07,454
Okay, so you do workout.
You are such a liar!

71
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:11,525
Oh! Wow! Did Stevie say
something funny or... ?

72
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,026
- Grant, this is David Rose.
- Hi.

73
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,493
He's one of our permanent guests here.

74
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,944
Don't say that... again.

75
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,545
Grant does repairs around here.

76
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,828
- Oh, great.
- He was also just trying to tell me

77
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:23,199
that he got that body
from just being a handyman.

78
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:25,926
Well, isn't Grant just a big fat liar!

79
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:30,706
- Um...
- I gotta grab the right marette, so...

80
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,041
My head is all over the place.
She keeps distracting me.

81
00:03:36,646 --> 00:03:40,487
Wow. He is wearing a tight shirt!

82
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,096
So is he gonna do some repairs
on your... on your undies?

83
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:46,995
Who's to say he hasn't already.

84
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,801
Wow! Great.

85
00:03:49,826 --> 00:03:51,591
Why, is that a problem for you?

86
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,859
No. No. Do you.

87
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:56,895
Do him. Do both. Do things.

88
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,530
- Great. I think I might.
- Yeah.

89
00:03:58,565 --> 00:04:01,467
Good. Jump in.

90
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,504
So...

91
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:10,308
We should probably
establish some boundaries

92
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:12,544
about this whole friends
with benefits thing.

93
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:14,579
Okay. Yeah. No, let's do that.

94
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:16,914
Let's, uh, let's put up some boundaries

95
00:04:16,948 --> 00:04:19,417
uh, for the infrequent benefits
that our friendship has.

96
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:21,151
I think that's really good.

97
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:23,588
Can we do that after
you screw mister fix-it

98
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:26,501
or... would you like to do it now?

99
00:04:26,526 --> 00:04:27,992
Let's throw some boundaries up.

100
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:29,861
'Kay.

101
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:32,830
Hey, Twyla.

102
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:37,066
Twyla!

103
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:38,702
Twyla?!

104
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:45,813
I'm so sorry. I really didn't
think that was gonna hit you.

105
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:47,582
That's okay. Your mom did the
same thing to me this morning.

106
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:49,932
- Okay.
- What can I get you guys?

107
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,926
Just coffees. Thanks.

108
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,417
So what's going on over there?

109
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:57,495
I'm just working on something.
Just a little thing for Mutt.

110
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:00,131
Oh! Is it his birthday or something?

111
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,000
No. Um, my dad always said,

112
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:03,735
"When in doubt, say it with a song."

113
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:05,536
He was a roadie with Fleetwood Mac

114
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,039
and that was the last thing
Mick Fleetwood said to him...

115
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:12,010
Before the band hit him
with a restraining order.

116
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:14,797
So you're writing a song for Mutt then?

117
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:16,489
Yeah, I'm trying to.

118
00:05:16,523 --> 00:05:18,649
Cute! So what, is it about...

119
00:05:18,674 --> 00:05:22,220
Your feelings, or is it love and... what?

120
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:24,130
Are we shooting a Dateline
investigative report?

121
00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:26,165
No... we're not.

122
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,740
I'm just looking out for my friend.

123
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:33,607
Um... honestly, Twy, ixnay on the ongsay.

124
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,075
Because I tried it once

125
00:05:36,109 --> 00:05:38,990
and the guy ripped the
guitar out of my hands

126
00:05:39,015 --> 00:05:42,380
and he just started
smashing it on the ground.

127
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:45,596
Granted, I'm tone deaf and he was a...

128
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:48,510
He was a super angry marine, but...

129
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:50,889
Just let the girl write
her boyfriend a song!

130
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:53,190
Okay, I know! And I'm all
for it, I'm all for it.

131
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:54,689
I just think it's um...

132
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:57,561
I think it's a super big mistake.

133
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:12,316
David!

134
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,818
Jocelyn. Hi.

135
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:17,254
Can I ask you something?

136
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:19,056
Uh... that depends.

137
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:20,891
How shall I put this?

138
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:22,460
You strike me as the sort of person

139
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:25,096
that had a hard time in high school.

140
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,697
Thank you.

141
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:29,905
Your floral top, for instance.

142
00:06:30,452 --> 00:06:31,975
Is there something I can help you with?

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,104
Well, there's a new kid in my school

144
00:06:34,138 --> 00:06:35,705
and he's having a little
trouble fitting in.

145
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:37,874
Mm-hmm.

146
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:40,377
He's also struggling with his sexuality,

147
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:42,312
which I think that you may be also...

148
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:43,813
What can I help you with, Jocelyn?

149
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:46,182
Well, I was thinking,
wouldn't it be wonderful

150
00:06:46,217 --> 00:06:48,217
if you could come down to the school,

151
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,617
you know, maybe talk to him

152
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:51,919
and tell him that...
things only get better.

153
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:59,421
The idea of me life
coaching another human being

154
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:03,792
should scare you. A lot. I don't...

155
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:07,462
I knew there was a good person
in there somewhere, David.

156
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:10,365
Oh, and honey, get the quilted;

157
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,433
that other stuff will chafe you right up.

158
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:16,871
So this is weird.

159
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:19,207
Um, today marks the longest relationship

160
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:21,309
that I've ever voluntarily
had with someone.

161
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,786
Voluntarily.

162
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:25,693
Yeah. The actual longest
relationship was um...

163
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,527
A three month affair with a Saudi prince,

164
00:07:27,552 --> 00:07:29,187
but for the last two months of that

165
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:31,622
I was trapped in his palace
trying to get to an embassy.

166
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:34,525
Um, so... hey. How is it
going with you and Twyla?

167
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,460
You guys are looking cute.

168
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:40,250
Uh... I don't know.

169
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,399
Why? What's going on?

170
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:49,773
I dunno. It... it's nothing. It's fine.

171
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:52,743
Okay, if my boyfriend ever described

172
00:07:52,777 --> 00:07:55,278
our relationship as "fine,"
I think I would literally...

173
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:58,295
it's just... it feels
like it's run its course.

174
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,209
- What?
- And I think we've both known it for a while now.

175
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:06,756
Oh.

176
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,998
Oh, give me a break. How did you find me?

177
00:08:17,032 --> 00:08:20,235
Well, where else is there to go?

178
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:21,803
And Johnny may have told me.

179
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:23,771
Thank you, Johnny.

180
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:26,240
Moira, why are you making
this so difficult for me?

181
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:28,442
Oh... where do I start?

182
00:08:28,477 --> 00:08:30,577
Um, you know, I think it's
best we don't go there.

183
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:33,611
No, I'd like to go there. Please, take me.

184
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:37,017
Fifty thousand dollars.
Does that sound familiar?

185
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:39,640
- Yes. You gave that to me as a downpayment
- No! Loaned it.

186
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:41,586
You gave it to me as a down payment

187
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:43,144
for my buffalonian town house.

188
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:45,908
We handed you the money and you said... ?

189
00:08:49,418 --> 00:08:51,351
- Thank you?
- Oh, too late.

190
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:55,066
Well, Moira, considering you had

191
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:57,357
over 500 million dollars in the bank,

192
00:08:57,392 --> 00:08:59,791
I'm a little personally
offended that I didn't get more.

193
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:01,094
Go away, Deedee.

194
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:05,765
No. No. Not until I do
what I came here to do.

195
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,901
Didn't want to hurt your
feelings, but I forgot.

196
00:09:07,936 --> 00:09:09,502
- Don't you dare.
- You don't have feelings.

197
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:12,605
- Don't you dare.
- Yes, yes. I am paying you back.

198
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,386
It's not everything, but it's a start.

199
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,653
So walk me through this...

200
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:25,536
She offered you a cheque
and you turned it down?

201
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:27,438
She was insulting us!

202
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:30,341
Moira, the woman dates
dive bar owners, okay?

203
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:32,577
Let her insult us!

204
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:33,944
Well, I don't know whether you've noticed,

205
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:36,113
but we could use the money.

206
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:37,948
You talk about bed bugs?

207
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,784
That check could pay for fumigation.

208
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:41,919
Better yet, we could move to a place

209
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:43,421
that doesn't have bed bugs.

210
00:09:43,455 --> 00:09:45,990
I don't want her money. I want our money.

211
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:48,726
She owes us! We loaned her $50,000 dollars!

212
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:51,162
We gave her $50,000 dollars,

213
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:53,869
and you spent more than
that on wigs that year.

214
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,600
I don't see any one else
lining up to give us cheques.

215
00:09:56,634 --> 00:10:00,069
Why are you taking her side?

216
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:02,372
I'm not taking her side, but
she's offering us a way out

217
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:04,541
and you're letting your
pride get in the way.

218
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:06,343
It's all I have left, John, literally.

219
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:07,778
Swallow it, Moira.

220
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:10,614
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

221
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:13,249
And then we can buy a case of champagne

222
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:15,418
to wash it down with.

223
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:20,189
So... you and Grant.

224
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:22,591
How are things going?

225
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:25,561
Uh... well, he asked me
out for dinner tonight,

226
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:27,830
so... we're gonna do that.

227
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:29,064
We're gonna go for dinner, Grant and I.

228
00:10:29,098 --> 00:10:32,234
Yeah! Yeah, that's...

229
00:10:32,268 --> 00:10:34,670
Well, he seems like a
really like respectable guy.

230
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:37,071
Like one of those guys that has like a...

231
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:40,007
Candy bowl of condoms on his
bedside table or something.

232
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:41,776
Oh, hope so. Wonder what colour I'll get.

233
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:42,977
Yeah!

234
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:46,881
So I am mentoring a
teen in crisis... later.

235
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:48,249
That's what I'm doing.

236
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:50,485
One of Jocelyn's students, so...

237
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,286
He's being bullied because he's different,

238
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:54,422
so I'm helping to change his life.

239
00:10:54,457 --> 00:10:56,056
Giving back, so...

240
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,592
- Wow...
- Yeah.

241
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:01,027
And on a scale of one to ten,

242
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:04,698
how much are you looking forward to that?

243
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:07,368
Three point five. I'm gonna leave you be

244
00:11:07,402 --> 00:11:09,069
because it's not everyday
you get to go on a date

245
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:11,338
with a guy who owns a windowless van, so...

246
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:13,006
Oh, Grant.

247
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,875
Hi!

248
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,838
What're you doing? You
checking out porn again?

249
00:11:18,863 --> 00:11:20,346
I'm gonna go.

250
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:22,348
I'm gonna go. Um...

251
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:23,949
Warmest regards to you both.

252
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:27,520
Best wishes.

253
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,758
Such a weird dude.

254
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,459
Yes. Yes, he is.

255
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:00,653
You must be Connor.

256
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,733
Yeah.

257
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:05,786
I don't know how much
Mrs. Schitt has told you,

258
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:08,911
but she asked me to
come in and have a chat.

259
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:13,015
She thinks that since
we're both... new here

260
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:14,517
it might be worth talking about some things

261
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:17,600
like, you know, fitting in.

262
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:25,198
Apparently you're having
trouble fitting in.

263
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:27,533
Who... who... who are... who are you?

264
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,434
Oh, my name is David.

265
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:31,737
Are you... like a doctor or something?

266
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:32,905
A psychologist?

267
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:34,740
Am I what? N-uh, no.

268
00:12:34,774 --> 00:12:37,910
So why would I talk to you?

269
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:41,079
I don't know. Because
your teacher is concerned

270
00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:42,848
that you're having trouble adjusting.

271
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:46,451
So she told you to come here
and... and what, help... help me?

272
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:49,888
Look at you. Look at your pants.

273
00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:52,456
Excuse me! I am sensing a
tinge of disrespect here.

274
00:12:52,491 --> 00:12:54,025
I'll tell you what my problem is.

275
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:55,860
I'm a 16-year-old gay kid

276
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:58,462
living in a town that
makes me wanna throw up.

277
00:12:58,497 --> 00:12:59,998
The issue isn't me not fitting in.

278
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:03,401
It's me not wanting to fit in.

279
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:07,404
Is there anything else you
wanna, you wanna help me with?

280
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:11,441
No.

281
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:29,159
Go ahead and order whatever
you want. This is on us.

282
00:13:29,193 --> 00:13:32,362
Oh. They're letting you
run up a long tab, are they?

283
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,497
You see?

284
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:37,067
Well, I hear the pork is very good here.

285
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:40,070
The ribs, the chops, the roast...

286
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:42,135
Nothing for me, thanks.

287
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,107
Well, isn't that funny. Because
Moira doesn't eat here either.

288
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:46,876
But I will be eating and I just don't know

289
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,078
whether to have the ribs or the chops,

290
00:13:49,112 --> 00:13:51,280
but I'm definitely ordering pork.

291
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:53,549
If you mention pork one more time...

292
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,885
Moira, um... don't you have something

293
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,152
you wanna say to your sister?

294
00:13:57,187 --> 00:13:58,554
No.

295
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,322
Oh, I'm pretty sure you do.

296
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:02,424
I'm pretty sure I don't.

297
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,726
Thank you for trying, Johnny. Truly.

298
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,928
But like I'm just really
uncomfortable right now

299
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:09,564
with my older sister acting
like a stubborn child.

300
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,900
Okay, why don't we all
take a deep breath here

301
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:16,337
and try and remember what's
really important, okay?

302
00:14:16,371 --> 00:14:20,523
We are family, and we
have to hang onto that.

303
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,810
And you know as well as I do, Moira,

304
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:24,612
that in times of crisis,

305
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:28,181
the one thing we need
to hang onto is family.

306
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:29,416
Okay, okay.

307
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,618
Deedee...

308
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:37,724
We appreciate you coming to this town...

309
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:41,261
And offering whatever
it is you're offering.

310
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:43,363
Much appreciated. 'Cause seriously,

311
00:14:43,397 --> 00:14:44,598
I thought you were just
coming here to gloat.

312
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:46,633
No, no, no.

313
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:50,604
I came here in the spirit
of giving and forgiving.

314
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:53,406
The... the gloating thing was a bonus.

315
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:55,571
Moira, go on...

316
00:14:57,278 --> 00:14:59,778
Yes, go on.

317
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:08,687
We need help. Please help us.

318
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:16,861
Okay! I will. Hmm?

319
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:20,098
Oh!

320
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,567
I'm gonna do this for you, but
mostly, I'm doing it for me.

321
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:25,370
Why? Because you can't... And I can.

322
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:27,272
Okay.

323
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,575
How much are we gonna make this out for?

324
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:34,112
Oh... sh... I haven't the
foggiest. I couldn't...

325
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:35,647
I couldn't come up with a number.

326
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:39,184
I mean, I... whatever you think is fair.

327
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:41,518
Well, you guys gave me fifty grand, right?

328
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:45,956
Yes, we gave you fifty
thousand when we had the money.

329
00:15:45,991 --> 00:15:51,095
But I can't... I can't ask
you for fifty thousand dollars.

330
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:54,999
Whatever you think is
the... Equivalent amount.

331
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:57,902
Okay, I think I can do you...

332
00:15:57,936 --> 00:15:59,636
A little better than that.

333
00:15:59,671 --> 00:16:01,138
Okay?

334
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:13,268
Oh, so... unnecessary,
Deedee, but thank you.

335
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:17,621
Well, who's up for pork?

336
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:19,790
Okay... so you're telling me

337
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:22,257
your girlfriend is on
a date with someone else

338
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,192
and, instead of doing something about it,

339
00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:26,361
you're here talking to me,

340
00:16:26,396 --> 00:16:28,431
a kid who practically
has no respect for you.

341
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:30,866
Well, first of all, you're a little bitchy.

342
00:16:30,901 --> 00:16:33,268
Second of all, she is not my girlfriend.

343
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:35,404
She's someone I'm
occasionally having sex with

344
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,907
because we're bored and desperate.

345
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:41,009
Ah... you're doing a friends with
benefits thing with this girl.

346
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:43,010
Have you not seen the 42
films they've made about it?

347
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,780
It never works.

348
00:16:45,815 --> 00:16:48,416
Okay, well, movies aren't
always right, all right?

349
00:16:48,451 --> 00:16:49,731
You'll learn that later in life.

350
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:51,619
I happen to be a little bit
older than you are, so...

351
00:16:51,654 --> 00:16:53,120
- Obviously.
- Okay.

352
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:54,355
Well, I think we're good here.

353
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:59,461
You're gonna be okay, right? You're stable?

354
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:01,495
I have a party later.
Can you buy me some beer?

355
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:04,380
Uh, no. Can you buy me some beer?!

356
00:17:14,943 --> 00:17:17,478
Hey! Can I grab a glass of water?

357
00:17:17,512 --> 00:17:19,312
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

358
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:21,514
So how's the uh... song going?

359
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:23,149
Is that... Is the song still a thing?

360
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:25,452
Yeah! Do you wanna hear some of it?

361
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:28,588
Um, I would love to, but
I actually hate music,

362
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:30,723
so... I don't think I'd
be a very good judge.

363
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:33,193
- You hate music?
- Mm-hmm...

364
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:35,308
Are we sure that Mutt likes music?

365
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,498
'Cause I feel like if he didn't
it could be kind of... awkward.

366
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:40,566
Are you feeling okay?

367
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:46,331
Um... I just don't think that...
The song thing is a good idea.

368
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:49,674
For, like, a lot of reasons.

369
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:51,543
Um... are you sure that
you wanna put yourself

370
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:54,346
in such a vulnerable situation, Twy?

371
00:17:54,381 --> 00:17:56,548
Are you saying you don't
think Mutt would like it?

372
00:17:56,582 --> 00:18:00,119
I don't know. I mean... I'm not sure.

373
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:02,086
Maybe, but... I don't... I'm not...

374
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:04,022
yeah, I'm not sure.

375
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:06,491
Did you talk to Mutt?
Because I know that...

376
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:08,426
We've been sort of off for a while.

377
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,294
And I've been just trying to
think of things to make it better

378
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:12,529
and so I'm... you know, I'm
just trying to make it work.

379
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:18,369
I think that you should
talk to Mutt before...

380
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:20,071
Breaking into song.

381
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:28,945
Thank you, Alexis.

382
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:31,415
For what?

383
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:32,882
Bye.

384
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:48,344
In all honesty, Mutt
was just a place holder.

385
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:51,233
According to my tea leaves, the guy
I'm suppose to marry is black, so...

386
00:18:54,406 --> 00:18:55,337
Oh.

387
00:18:55,372 --> 00:18:57,740
- What and why are we drinking?
- Oh my goodness!

388
00:18:57,775 --> 00:19:01,444
Um, I don't know, and today,
some snippy teen told me

389
00:19:01,478 --> 00:19:03,479
that my life was a mess, so...

390
00:19:03,513 --> 00:19:06,427
And I am now a single person.

391
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:09,107
Oh...

392
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:12,788
So did you spend the night washing
your clothes on Grant's abs?

393
00:19:12,822 --> 00:19:14,790
- You're funny.
- Mm-hmm.

394
00:19:14,824 --> 00:19:16,925
Um, Grant went to the
bathroom and never came back.

395
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,494
- Thank you.
- What?

396
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:20,488
He w... he went to the
bathroom and never came back?

397
00:19:20,497 --> 00:19:22,364
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh...

398
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:24,433
So either I was stood up
halfway through my date

399
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:27,703
or Grant has some serious digestive issues.

400
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:30,639
- Mm.
- Wow. Sounds like a real catch.

401
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:37,579
So word on teen street
is that our little...

402
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:41,216
Friends with benefits situation is a...

403
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,852
- Not a good idea?
- Is a bad idea.

404
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:45,920
And because I don't have
any other friends here,

405
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:48,556
I can't afford to lose you, so...

406
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:50,358
I think it's best if we just...

407
00:19:50,392 --> 00:19:51,326
- Friends.
- Friends. Yup.

408
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,228
I think that's best.

409
00:19:53,262 --> 00:19:55,196
Good. This is good.

410
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:56,431
- That's good, right?
- That's good.

411
00:19:56,465 --> 00:19:59,534
Okay. Well... Warmest wishes to that.

412
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:00,635
Kindest regards.

413
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:02,003
Yeah!

414
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:03,904
Cheers!

415
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:09,343
- Whoa. Twy...
- Mm...

416
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:11,845
- That's...
- It's good, right?

417
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,027
My eyes are tearing.

418
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:17,706
So this is it?

419
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:19,508
After all that?

420
00:20:22,782 --> 00:20:25,550
And we paid for the dinner!

421
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:27,576
So we lost money on the whole deal.

422
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:35,241
I'll tell ya, she's gonna be embarrassed

423
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:37,295
when this thing gets cashed.

424
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,514
She will be embarrassed. She missed a zero.

425
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,358
Moira, she missed a zero or two.

426
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:48,502
I... you know what?

427
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:50,003
I'm gonna call her. I'm
calling her right now,

428
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:53,150
that... What a cheap-ass amount!

429
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:55,775
Turn your light off, John.

430
00:20:58,536 --> 00:21:01,005
Your sister is a cheap ass.

431
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,093
Cheap ass.

432
00:21:18,962 --> 00:21:21,771
We're planning a surprise

433
00:21:21,796 --> 00:21:22,796
party for your mother.

434
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:24,530
Listen to the words
coming out of your mouth.

435
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:25,397
Then you plan it.

436
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:26,231
No!

437
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:27,366
Oh, he snap-diva'd!

438
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:28,434
Talk to the hand, son,

439
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:30,770
because the ears are no longer working.

440
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:31,804
Oh my God.

441
00:21:31,806 --> 00:21:34,507
Okay, that's not at all how that works.

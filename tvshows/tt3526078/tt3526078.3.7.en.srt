1
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:10,751
Okay well, you could've
dropped me off back there!

2
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:12,143
Oh, don't be silly honey,

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,246
we're happy to drive you
right to the front door.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,781
Yeah, this is an iconic moment
in all of our lives,

5
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,683
and I think we should
experience it to the fullest.

6
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,886
We're very proud of you, Alexis.

7
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:21,896
Thank you.

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,031
Is that appropriate attire

9
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:25,609
for high school, do you think?

10
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,159
- Yeah well, what's wrong with it?!
- Well...

11
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,561
Well, now you're making
me nervous!

12
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:30,996
Anyway, just don't trust anyone

13
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,697
that wants to be your friend
on the first day, okay?

14
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,066
And you mustn't let anyone
push you around,

15
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,535
I will not relive that
bullying nightmare.

16
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,780
I wasn't bullied.

17
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:40,137
She doesn't mean you, Alexis.

18
00:00:40,172 --> 00:00:42,073
Uh, it wasn't that bad.

19
00:00:42,296 --> 00:00:43,696
That's the heartbreaking part,

20
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:45,431
He was so blissfully unaware.

21
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:47,734
- Okay, I'm gonna go.
- Ugh!

22
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:49,903
Okay, I think you're brave.

23
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:51,704
Well, that's very nice of you
to say, David.

24
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:52,960
Okay, he's being sarcastic!

25
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:54,015
- What?!
- Oh.

26
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,054
It's a defense mechanism.
From all the bullying.

27
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,277
Oh my God!

28
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:59,974
<i>General Store</i>
Aired the 21rst February

29
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:02,382
Sync and correction by LittleDuck
www.addic7ed.com

30
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:09,380
I can't tell what's more tragic,

31
00:01:09,405 --> 00:01:12,091
the fact that the only store
in town is closing,

32
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:13,593
or that they've...

33
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:17,523
decided to display fungal cream
beside the cereal boxes.

34
00:01:17,588 --> 00:01:19,422
That's actually really
convenient,

35
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:21,200
because I forgot to have
breakfast,

36
00:01:21,235 --> 00:01:22,735
and I'm running low
on fungal cream, so...

37
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,337
I don't wanna hear you say
fungal again.

38
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:25,397
Fungal?

39
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:28,085
Yeah, it's like they knew
what the consumer wanted,

40
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:31,349
and then ran in the opposite
direction.

41
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:33,683
- Finding everything okay?
- Yes. Yeah.

42
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,566
It's sad about the store.

43
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:37,781
Thank you, it's been very hard.

44
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,538
Yeah, I can imagine.

45
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:42,577
Yeah, they just missed
the mark, you know?

46
00:01:42,796 --> 00:01:44,763
I mean, this store
in the right hands

47
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:46,522
could be very lucrative.

48
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:48,724
Uh huh, and by the right hands,
you mean your hands?

49
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:50,326
Well, I mean someone
with faultless taste

50
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,894
who understands what people
want and need,

51
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:54,811
and if those happen to be
my hands, then...

52
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:56,921
So why don't you do
something about it?

53
00:01:57,054 --> 00:01:58,265
I'm pretty sure telling them

54
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,657
that they've driven their store
into the ground

55
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:00,983
might be rubbing salt
in the wound.

56
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:03,046
No, I'm saying ever since
you walked in here

57
00:02:03,108 --> 00:02:05,890
you've been talking about how you
would've done things differently,

58
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:08,046
so now's your chance.

59
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:09,767
Okay, your eyebrows never move,

60
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,160
so I can't tell whether
you're being serious or not.

61
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:13,888
I think you should put
what little money you have

62
00:02:13,913 --> 00:02:15,458
where your mouth is.

63
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:18,077
I do have a very good idea.

64
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:19,928
What you lack in most things,

65
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:22,288
you make up for
in unsubstantiated confidence.

66
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:23,288
Okay, are we good to go?!

67
00:02:23,313 --> 00:02:24,934
Good morning, class.

68
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,693
I'm sure you have all noticed

69
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:29,226
there's a new student
in our midst.

70
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:32,908
Let's give a warm welcome
to Alexis Rose.

71
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,717
She is here until the end
of the semester

72
00:02:34,742 --> 00:02:36,604
to finish her diploma.

73
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:41,948
Okay, so let's open our books.

74
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:45,186
Oh um, I'd just like
to say a few words.

75
00:02:45,557 --> 00:02:48,192
Okay, we're actually just
running a little bit behind.

76
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:49,296
- Hey.
- Oh.

77
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:51,819
So as Jocelyn said,
my name is Alexis,

78
00:02:52,078 --> 00:02:54,346
and yes, I did not finish
high school.

79
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,295
Um, it's this long, boring
story involving a yacht,

80
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,921
and a famous soccer player,

81
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:00,043
and like...

82
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:01,835
a ton of mushrooms.

83
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,782
Anyway, I think it would
be so great

84
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:05,141
if we could just
go around the room,

85
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,652
and everyone could tell me like,

86
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,247
five things about yourself.

87
00:03:08,394 --> 00:03:11,464
Actually, we don't
have time for that today.

88
00:03:11,715 --> 00:03:14,240
Maybe you could talk
between classes,

89
00:03:14,265 --> 00:03:16,583
or after school,
or on the weekends.

90
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:18,944
- Yeah, totally.
- Yeah. Okay.

91
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:21,438
So just find me
after class, or...

92
00:03:23,257 --> 00:03:24,590
Good morning, Twyla.

93
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:27,450
Sorry I'm late,
but I have morning muffins.

94
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:29,077
Oh, thanks, Ivan.

95
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:30,602
Yeah, they keep selling out.

96
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:31,811
Ivan!

97
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:33,896
- Bob's friend?
- Oh yeah!

98
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:35,455
Johnny Rose, remember?

99
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:36,624
Bagels, I know.

100
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,583
Yes, yes, yes, yes, bagels.

101
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:41,671
Oh, I see you have
a new enterprise.

102
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,907
Yeah, it was always my dream
to bake muffins.

103
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:46,392
Well, funny you should
mention it,

104
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:47,984
because I'm thinking of

105
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:50,561
doing a continental breakfast
at the motel,

106
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:52,855
and this could be uh...
very helpful.

107
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,472
Yeah. I not make breakfast.

108
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:57,593
No, no, no,
a continental breakfast,

109
00:03:57,618 --> 00:03:59,643
just pastries and coffee.

110
00:03:59,797 --> 00:04:00,807
No coffee.

111
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:04,691
Oh, I wouldn't expect you
to make the coffee.

112
00:04:04,738 --> 00:04:07,874
No, I make coffee,
but only for myself.

113
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:09,940
Yeah, no, no, it's just
your muffins

114
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:11,340
that I'm interested in.

115
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,449
I bake for Twyla.

116
00:04:13,522 --> 00:04:16,158
Oh, but it's always nice
to have new customers.

117
00:04:16,183 --> 00:04:18,988
Yes, yes, I think we should
talk about this, Ivan.

118
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:21,087
Yeah, I'd love to see
your operation.

119
00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:26,593
Uh yeah, yeah, yeah,
just come by place

120
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:28,769
and I show you kitchen.

121
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:30,915
Yes. Yeah.

122
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:34,354
- Well, yeah, okay.
- Good, yes.

123
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,047
- Yes, see you.
- Bye!

124
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:37,715
So long.

125
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:41,527
Wow, this could be very exciting.

126
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:43,706
You know, a continental
breakfast could add

127
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:45,663
an extra star on our rating.

128
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,461
Oh wow, so how many stars
would that give you?

129
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:50,973
One.

130
00:04:51,496 --> 00:04:53,792
So, there are carols playing,

131
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:56,722
and it snows inside
all day long.

132
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:58,353
Gwen's gonna lose her mind!

133
00:04:58,387 --> 00:04:59,754
Shh! Shh! Shh!

134
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:03,358
What now?!

135
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:05,346
No need to terminate
your chitter-chatter

136
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,636
on our accounts.

137
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,824
You gonna tell them,
or should I?

138
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:11,608
Ladies, um we have
some good news...

139
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:14,090
Christmas world!
Moving into town!

140
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,683
Bob, okay, there's a way
to do these things,

141
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,807
and I'm the one who's supposed
to lead these meetings,

142
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:20,480
- all right?
- They wanna take over

143
00:05:20,505 --> 00:05:21,988
- the general store.
- Bob!

144
00:05:22,227 --> 00:05:23,369
I'm sorry!

145
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:25,418
It's just, you know,
it's big news.

146
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:28,756
And what on earth
is a Christmas World?

147
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:31,018
They sell Christmas stuff
all year round.

148
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:33,081
But is this really
the kind of business

149
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:34,822
we want in this town?

150
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,784
You know, I have yet
to find an ornament in there

151
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:39,152
that I'd put on my tree,

152
00:05:39,177 --> 00:05:42,546
And I heard those little elves
they have running around,

153
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:44,519
they're actually underage kids.

154
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,362
Ladies, if we don't
approve this,

155
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:49,388
then Christmas World
will take its fake snow,

156
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:52,162
and its all-you-can-drink
nog fountain to Elmdale!

157
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:54,084
Well, that makes
our decision easy.

158
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:55,624
Oh, Moira!

159
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,196
Moira, Moira, Moira.

160
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,131
A word to the wise, okay?

161
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,785
You don't vote against
Christmas.

162
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:03,754
It's huge business.

163
00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:05,183
Tourist dollars!

164
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,005
Well, I'm not voting for it.

165
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:09,781
I'm inclined to side
with Veronica on this.

166
00:06:10,864 --> 00:06:12,626
All right, look guys,
this is a big decision.

167
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:14,283
Let's take a little time
to think about it.

168
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:16,410
It's-it's Christmas World!

169
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:18,560
We don't wanna get
on their naughty list.

170
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:27,581
Oh.

171
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:29,996
This is where I bake.

172
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,397
I have three ovens.

173
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:32,799
Is tradition in my family.

174
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:35,948
We make vatritza, burek,
gibantsa...

175
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:39,210
and now I making uh,
Danish, eclair,

176
00:06:39,252 --> 00:06:42,254
American-style toaster
popping tart.

177
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:44,534
Wow, that sounds great, Ivan,

178
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,418
but I was thinking...

179
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:48,093
cinnamon buns.

180
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,397
You know, the smell of cinnamon

181
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:52,863
in the motel lobby, mmm!

182
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:54,655
Mr. Rose, for you,
I can make anything.

183
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,348
- Great.
- Blueberry bun,

184
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:57,619
butter tart,

185
00:06:57,644 --> 00:06:59,245
blueberry butter tart
with raisin,

186
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:01,760
blueberry butter tart
with chips of chocolate...

187
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:04,807
Well, let's just stick
with cinnamon buns for now,

188
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:06,300
and if this works,

189
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,661
we'll take it from there.

190
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:09,474
And I'm giving you
special price.

191
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:11,293
Thank you.

192
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:12,871
Because you know Twyla.

193
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,426
Yes, I do.

194
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:17,110
I watch you make her laugh.

195
00:07:18,532 --> 00:07:20,589
You watch me make her laugh?

196
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:22,957
Oh, so you...

197
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,949
you like Twyla!

198
00:07:25,957 --> 00:07:28,113
Oh, well, you should uh...

199
00:07:28,684 --> 00:07:29,800
talk to her, I guess.

200
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,292
No, no, I can't.

201
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:34,425
I try, but when I speak,

202
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:36,836
is like many, many muffin
in my mouth.

203
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,808
You talk for me?

204
00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:40,698
Oh, no, no, no,

205
00:07:40,723 --> 00:07:42,899
I wouldn't be too comfortable
doing that, no.

206
00:07:42,924 --> 00:07:44,457
You just say nice thing.

207
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,189
I'll give you cinnamon bun
for free.

208
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:48,005
You say, he's a good man,

209
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,629
hard worker, never hurt no one.

210
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:52,488
Well, I wouldn't lead
with that but uh...

211
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:55,570
no, no, I think this is better
coming from you.

212
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:05,331
So, I have some news.

213
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:07,346
Oh David, I'm not sure
I'm in the mood

214
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:10,000
to hear about another
sexual exploit.

215
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,693
I'm sorry, who is it this time?

216
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:14,763
I have actually been thinking
about going back to work.

217
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,841
That's wonderful!

218
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:18,933
You've received an offer?

219
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,971
Um, it's more of a plan
for an idea

220
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:25,300
of a-a thing that I will
be working at.

221
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,033
Well, that sounds less concrete,

222
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:30,293
but full of promise, I'm sure.

223
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:33,421
I know you've been moping about
the motel for some time now.

224
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:34,231
Mm,

225
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:35,496
decompressing.

226
00:08:35,643 --> 00:08:38,177
Um, and from that decompression

227
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:41,692
came the idea to start
my own business.

228
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,816
And just what is this
exciting new venture?

229
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:49,910
I plan to submit
a lease application

230
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:51,906
for the general store.

231
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:56,097
Can you imagine?

232
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,388
Not seizing on this opportunity.

233
00:09:01,423 --> 00:09:03,588
Well, I'll be investing
some of the money

234
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:04,949
I got from the Blouse Barn.

235
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:07,058
A bold decision.

236
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:10,902
Especially since the previous
business has since gone under.

237
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:12,690
Dare I say,

238
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:14,992
the space might be cursed?

239
00:09:15,026 --> 00:09:18,429
Okay, the general store
was a disaster.

240
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:20,831
And your plan is to raise
it from the ashes?

241
00:09:20,856 --> 00:09:23,858
Well, that's a risky move
on the part of your investors.

242
00:09:23,893 --> 00:09:25,589
I don't have any investors.

243
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:27,371
It's just me.

244
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:29,480
Just you?

245
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:32,262
I am doing this all on my own.

246
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,958
All on your own?

247
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:37,639
Yeah, I've actually given it
a lot of thought.

248
00:09:37,782 --> 00:09:38,949
You have?

249
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:42,210
You're the that's been
telling me to get back to work!

250
00:09:42,244 --> 00:09:43,878
- I did?
- Oh my God!

251
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:45,980
What, I'm simply
asking questions!

252
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:48,627
No, you're not, you're just
repeating random things

253
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:49,839
that I've been saying!

254
00:09:49,864 --> 00:09:52,160
Oh, far be it from me
to stand in your way

255
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:55,871
while you roll the dice
with your hard-earned savings!

256
00:09:56,918 --> 00:09:58,318
Thank you!

257
00:09:58,578 --> 00:09:59,933
That's all you had to say.

258
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:13,784
The only people who buy silver
trees are serial killers,

259
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:15,238
and single men over 40,

260
00:10:15,263 --> 00:10:18,160
and my cousin, who is a single
man over 40.

261
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:22,659
Oh, what a startling
little tannenbaum.

262
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:24,351
To whom do we owe
our reciprocity

263
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:26,135
for this yuletide gift?

264
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,754
It says Christmas World
right on it.

265
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,324
Oh, I see!

266
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,245
Sometimes the eyes
won't allow the brain

267
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,683
to see things at first.

268
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:37,880
Like the cultural
and economic benefits...

269
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:40,900
of a seasonally specific store.

270
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:43,738
Okay, what did they send you?

271
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,972
Nothing, I assure you.

272
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:48,886
But when one considers
the alternatives...

273
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:51,470
Moira, are you caving on this?

274
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:53,381
I'm just thinking out loud.

275
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:56,933
What if a young, independent

276
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,144
business person were to step in?

277
00:11:00,302 --> 00:11:02,300
I worry, one worries,

278
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,534
you worry, are they too naive,

279
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,027
or overly coddled,

280
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:09,262
or emotionally precious

281
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:11,998
to handle the rigor
of establishing a business?

282
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,533
Look, I uh...

283
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:17,070
I don't wanna pressure anyone,

284
00:11:17,104 --> 00:11:18,236
but uh...

285
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:20,904
Gwen did tell me if I uh,

286
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:23,140
I don't get Christmas World
passed,

287
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,002
I shouldn't come home.

288
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,347
I shouldn't...
I shouldn't come home.

289
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:33,832
Okay, let's put it to a vote.
Shall we?

290
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:38,629
All those in favor
of Christmas World?

291
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:43,975
Hah! Done!

292
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,500
Thank you, Moira!

293
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:49,855
It's Gwen.

294
00:11:50,238 --> 00:11:52,002
The woman has a sixth sense.

295
00:11:52,037 --> 00:11:54,129
Hi honey, are you sitting down?

296
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:56,273
Trust me, it's for the best.

297
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:57,910
It's happening!

298
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:01,278
It's really happening!

299
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,791
So here's the thing
about Marie Antoinette.

300
00:12:03,816 --> 00:12:06,300
Even though I love to eat cake,

301
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,864
I think I'd be pretty annoyed
with her myself.

302
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:10,423
I do see your hand up Alexis,

303
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:12,336
it's just that you probably
haven't had a chance

304
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:13,362
to catch up.

305
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:15,323
Okay, it's just that
she never actually said

306
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:16,486
"let them eat cake."

307
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:19,181
Um well, that depends
on who you ask.

308
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,053
Hmm, well,
I asked Kirsten Dunst,

309
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:22,612
who played her in the movie.

310
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:25,246
Um, that line was actually
written years before

311
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:27,316
Marie Antoinette allegedly
said it.

312
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:30,002
And um, Kirsten also told me
at the premiere

313
00:12:30,027 --> 00:12:31,589
that she was jealous
of my bangs.

314
00:12:31,614 --> 00:12:33,217
Thank you for that contribution

315
00:12:33,242 --> 00:12:34,488
to the discussion, now...

316
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:36,280
My friends used
to call me Marie,

317
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,160
And that was mainly
because I was casually

318
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:40,437
seeing Prince Harry,
so there was the whole like,

319
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:41,960
is she gonna be a princess
thing,

320
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,238
um, but it's also because
we were going through

321
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:46,488
this very dark phase
where we were just like,

322
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:47,824
partying too hard.

323
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:49,951
Thank you for your enthusiasm,

324
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:52,471
it's just that we have a lot
to cover here.

325
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:53,644
Girls?

326
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:56,410
What did I say about
passing notes in class?

327
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:58,994
I'll see you both after school.

328
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,543
You know who else passed notes?

329
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:01,932
This lady

330
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:04,145
passed a lot of secret notes,

331
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:07,767
and eventually was killed.

332
00:13:09,176 --> 00:13:11,308
Oh hi, how are you?

333
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:14,214
- Very busy.
- How am I?! Terrific!

334
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,853
Aside from the fact
that I caught wind

335
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:20,660
that Christmas World was moving
into the general store.

336
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:23,932
Just when I thought that
the taste levels in this town

337
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:26,285
were already scraping
the bottom of the barrel.

338
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,910
Oh! Tell me about it.

339
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:31,190
So you can imagine
my surprise when I found out

340
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:33,557
that the deciding factor
in all of this

341
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:35,183
was my own mother!

342
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:37,057
It seems extremely off brand

343
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:40,277
to support a disgusting
big box store like that.

344
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:44,480
David, sit, please.

345
00:13:49,864 --> 00:13:51,877
I know you think what
I did was cruel,

346
00:13:51,902 --> 00:13:53,886
but I was just protecting you.

347
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:56,440
And I'd say you'll understand
one day,

348
00:13:56,465 --> 00:13:58,254
but you don't enjoy children,

349
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,777
so perhaps you won't.

350
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,578
Okay, protect me from what?

351
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:02,902
From yourself.

352
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,026
Your father and I have not
prepared you

353
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:06,885
for an undertaking
of this scope!

354
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:08,861
Okay, what about
all the galleries?

355
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:09,910
Those were all me.

356
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:12,191
I've run businesses before.

357
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:15,728
Never on your own,
and never without a safety net.

358
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:18,034
I don't know how many times
I have to thank you

359
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,362
for the start-up money!

360
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:22,097
But I opened those
galleries myself.

361
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:25,127
And who do you think
bought all that art,

362
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:27,160
and sold out all your shows?

363
00:14:27,462 --> 00:14:29,205
Uh, my patrons.

364
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:38,572
And who do you think
bought all your patrons?

365
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:51,925
So you're telling me that
my entire professional career

366
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,293
was a sham?!

367
00:14:53,318 --> 00:14:55,162
We helped you because we could!

368
00:14:55,423 --> 00:14:58,292
And now I realize that
might not have been

369
00:14:58,317 --> 00:15:00,385
the best thing for you
or your autonomy, but...

370
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:02,153
Okay, well, now I guess
I'll never find out

371
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:03,940
if I could've succeeded
on my own.

372
00:15:04,522 --> 00:15:05,863
David!

373
00:15:18,426 --> 00:15:19,683
Hello, Mr. Rose.

374
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:22,072
Cinnamon buns for you.

375
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:24,543
Oh Ivan, thank you.

376
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,106
Ohh! These smell amazing!

377
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:30,010
And I have muffins for Twyla.

378
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:32,252
- Oh.
- Yeah, I'm going to talk to her now.

379
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:33,605
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

380
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,217
- Hi, Ivan.
- Um...

381
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,535
Here's the muffins.

382
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:43,713
- Goodbye.
- Yeah.

383
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,579
Wow!

384
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:49,054
Mr. Rose,

385
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,136
I blow it.

386
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,473
Oh, well, there's always
tomorrow, Ivan.

387
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:55,232
No, no, don't...
All right, have a seat.

388
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:57,754
I always watch romantic movies.

389
00:15:58,136 --> 00:15:59,199
"Got Mail,"

390
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:01,519
"When Harry Met Sally,"

391
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:03,116
"Smell of Woman."

392
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:06,160
Yeah, Ivan, you don't want
to be over-preparing.

393
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:08,379
- Oh.
- Hey, guys.

394
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:10,980
- What can I get you?
- I'm good man.

395
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:14,017
Okay, and?

396
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:15,403
I'll have the waffles.

397
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,949
And uh, eggs,

398
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:19,683
uh, uh,

399
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:23,011
what does dog say
before the breakfast?

400
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:25,629
Bun appetite.

401
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:28,839
Bun appetite.

402
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:30,863
Bun...

403
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:35,964
Bone appetit, I think
it's a dog bone joke.

404
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:37,410
Bun appetite.

405
00:16:38,738 --> 00:16:41,143
- Eggs and waffles.
- Hmm, yes.

406
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,502
Coming up.

407
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:45,965
- Yeah.
- I know.

408
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:48,019
Oh, well...

409
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:52,823
I think uh a little quality
control on this

410
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:54,644
- wouldn't hurt, huh?
- Yeah, yes.

411
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:04,753
Hey, I think that we started
out on the wrong foot.

412
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:07,408
And like, I totally get it,
there's a new girl in town,

413
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,403
and that can be
super intimidating,

414
00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:11,566
but I just wanted to let
you know that I'm actually

415
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:13,002
very approachable.

416
00:17:13,702 --> 00:17:15,457
- Okay.
- Okay.

417
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:18,316
So why don't you just show me
what that note says.

418
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:23,488
Girls,

419
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:26,830
passing notes in class
is not only disruptive

420
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:29,594
- to the whole student body...
- I started it.

421
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:32,324
I passed the note to Steph M.
And Becky.

422
00:17:34,022 --> 00:17:36,143
Alexis, if you're gonna be
in this class,

423
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:38,652
you are gonna have to learn
to be less disruptive.

424
00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:41,630
Now let's see what
was so important.

425
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:44,019
That really isn't necessary,
Mrs. Schitt.

426
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:46,746
"Alexis is too pretty,

427
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:50,675
and everyone's talking
about the dress.

428
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:52,793
So gorge."

429
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,066
Okay, I love that
you're so confident,

430
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:02,323
It's just that we're going
to have to focus

431
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,824
a little less on ourselves,

432
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,043
and a little more
on the material.

433
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:07,676
Totally.

434
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:13,293
I stole this dress
from Ashlee Simpson.

435
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:15,972
Or like, she stole it from me,
and then I stole it back.

436
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:18,794
Do you wanna have lunch
tomorrow?

437
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:21,722
Sure.

438
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:28,886
I just find it extremely
violating.

439
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:31,168
Because your parents
threw money at you?

440
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:32,692
Yes!

441
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,111
They paid for everything,

442
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:36,024
it's like a form of child abuse.

443
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,323
Don't quote me on this,

444
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:41,300
but it seems like their
intentions were good.

445
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:44,707
I mean, they didn't buy
all the good reviews

446
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:45,863
your galleries got.

447
00:18:45,897 --> 00:18:47,058
Who's to say?!

448
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,743
Yeah, I mean, they do give me
a small weekly stipend

449
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:52,369
for hanging out with you, so...

450
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:56,511
David, there you are.

451
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,003
I come bearing good news.

452
00:18:58,168 --> 00:19:00,502
And what's that, your friends
at Christmas World

453
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:02,386
are looking for
a deeply embittered,

454
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:04,480
mildly Hebraic-looking elf?!

455
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,910
I thought you might like to know

456
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:09,277
that council has agreed
to accept your application.

457
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:13,902
What about Christmas World?

458
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:16,064
I had a very effective strategy

459
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:17,941
to change everyone's minds,

460
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,643
that I ultimately didn't
get to use,

461
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:21,941
because Christmas World
pulled out.

462
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,817
This is good news!

463
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:28,869
I mean, yeah, if someone
hadn't snuffed out

464
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:31,422
the last remaining embers
of my self-confidence.

465
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:33,983
Why don't you channel some
of that charming self-pity

466
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:36,339
into a business plan, okay?

467
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,075
Because the lease is yours,
David,

468
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,730
if you still want it.

469
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:43,254
Which he does.

470
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:45,527
If there's anyone in this town
who might have the eye

471
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,683
to create something truly
beautiful,

472
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:49,348
it's you, David.

473
00:19:50,478 --> 00:19:52,433
And me, but in this case, you.

474
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:57,245
Okay.

475
00:19:57,522 --> 00:20:00,035
I will submit my application.

476
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:07,816
There's cinnamon buns
in the lobby!

477
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,441
These are good.

478
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:11,574
I know, where are these from?

479
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,479
Yeah, I got those for the motel.

480
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,238
They're supposed to be
for the guests!

481
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:16,773
Okay, well, they were
just sitting there.

482
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,732
Oh, they weren't just
sitting there, Alexis,

483
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:21,063
they're the product of a lot
of hard work!

484
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,629
In here, Moira.

485
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,855
There are cinnamon buns
in the lobby!

486
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,150
Oh come on, Moira, Moira!

487
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:30,919
These are for
the continental breakfast

488
00:20:30,944 --> 00:20:32,597
we're offering at the motel!

489
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:33,989
Continental breakfast?

490
00:20:34,014 --> 00:20:36,315
- They're for the guests!
- How whimsical.

491
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,386
It's a start, it's a start,

492
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:39,427
it's a big step.

493
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:41,471
What exactly goes into
a "continental breakfast?"

494
00:20:41,496 --> 00:20:43,573
It's a breakfast, David,

495
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:46,129
it's a light breakfast
with pastries and coffee.

496
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:47,868
What's continental about that?

497
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,546
It's for business travelers,

498
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:51,228
travelling the continent,

499
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:52,449
eating breakfast, and...

500
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:55,777
continental travelling.

501
00:20:55,802 --> 00:20:57,618
That doesn't sound
even remotely correct.

502
00:20:57,643 --> 00:20:59,644
Well, it's European, Moira, so...

503
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:01,615
Okay, come on, seriously!

504
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,007
There's only one left?!

505
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:05,018
I know, Stevie was eating
the other one.

506
00:21:05,053 --> 00:21:06,254
Here, why don't you have this,

507
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,558
and I'll take the big one.

508
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,006
It's all right,
I'll take care of it.

509
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,245
Well, I guess it would be wrong
to serve the guests day-olds.

510
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,683
You know this bun added
a star to our rating?

511
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,410
How many did we have before?

512
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:17,566
Not the point!

513
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:23,506

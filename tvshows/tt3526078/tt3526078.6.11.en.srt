1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,121
Okay, Stevie, I told you
I didn't want

2
00:00:03,206 --> 00:00:04,452
a jokey bachelor party.

3
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:06,655
Also, my T-shirt is missing
the "with".

4
00:00:06,776 --> 00:00:08,560
Oh, no, I had yours
custom-made.

5
00:00:08,645 --> 00:00:09,964
- Okay.
- Now,

6
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:12,362
<i>before I tell you what
I have planned...</i>

7
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,297
for tonight's festivities,

8
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,566
I think we can all agree
that putting me in charge

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,236
of your joint bachelor party
was a big mistake, right?

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,089
- I'm sure it's gonna be great.
- Absolutely.

11
00:00:21,174 --> 00:00:23,392
And the fact that you guys
wanted it to be

12
00:00:23,477 --> 00:00:24,729
the "bachelor party
of your dreams"

13
00:00:24,813 --> 00:00:27,804
only added extra,
totally unnecessary pressure

14
00:00:27,889 --> 00:00:29,116
- to the whole thing.
- 'Kay, Stevie,

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,060
- we never said that.
- Oh no, you didn't.

16
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:33,879
David sent me a seven-page
e-mail with the subject line,

17
00:00:33,974 --> 00:00:35,651
"The Bachelor Party
of My Dreams".

18
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,654
We will be happy with
whatever you've planned.

19
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,585
- Right, David?
- Yes.

20
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:41,764
Just depends on
what she's planned.

21
00:00:41,849 --> 00:00:44,050
Oh.

22
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:45,829
Oh...

23
00:00:45,914 --> 00:00:49,269
David, you wanted something
chic and elegant.

24
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:52,401
I have arranged for a night
of customized appetizers

25
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,680
and cocktails
at the Wobbly Elm.

26
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:56,484
Wow, that's bleak.

27
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:00,773
But thank you...
for planning that.

28
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:01,905
- There we go.
- Mm.

29
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:03,357
- Patrick...
- Yeah.

30
00:01:03,442 --> 00:01:04,926
- You just wanted one thing.
- Mm-hmm.

31
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:08,163
So before we indulge in
an elegant night of shots,

32
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:12,032
we will all experience
the thrill

33
00:01:12,183 --> 00:01:15,136
of Elmdale's finest
and only...

34
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:16,371
Escape Room.

35
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:17,840
- Yes!
- Okay,

36
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,715
isn't that a Jodie Foster movie?

37
00:01:19,806 --> 00:01:21,457
<i>No, David, that is
Panic Room.</i>

38
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,733
An escape room is like a,
a fun group game

39
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,102
where you're trapped
in a room

40
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:27,237
and you have to solve
all these puzzles to get out.

41
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,405
You lost me
at fun group game.

42
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,799
I'm sorry, my family agreed
to this?

43
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,768
Your family hasn't responded
to a single email,

44
00:01:33,853 --> 00:01:35,653
so they will be doing
what we tell them to do.

45
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:38,013
Is there anything else
on my list

46
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,563
that we could do this evening?

47
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:40,884
If you could come up with
the money

48
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,247
for the Tahitian dolphin
cruise,

49
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:45,118
I'd happily change plans. No?

50
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:47,219
Don't say a word.

51
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:50,359
<font color=#FF00FF>*SCHITT'S CREEK*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 06 Episode 11</font>

52
00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:53,148

Aired on: <font color="#00ffff">March 17, 2020</font>

53
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,953
So I leaned in and I said,
"Tippy, I'll take the job...

54
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:59,204
for a hundred grand more
than Clifton,

55
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:01,473
and a diamond tennis bracelet."

56
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:02,909
What was the bracelet for?

57
00:02:02,994 --> 00:02:05,279
Dramatic effect. Symbolism.

58
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:08,072
And you said Nicole Kidman
is starring in it?

59
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:10,007
Oh, it doesn't matter
who's starring!

60
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:11,949
I don't think the point
is getting across.

61
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:13,286
No, no, I get it.

62
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,618
It's just that a lot of people
would have a really hard time

63
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,084
saying no
to that kind of work,

64
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:18,888
especially when you spent
the last three years

65
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,956
talking about how badly

66
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,789
you wanted to get outta
this place.

67
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:23,692
Oh, we're still
on course.

68
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,458
Oh, you know what they say,

69
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:28,494
when one door closes,
the floodgates open.

70
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:29,963
You got another job?

71
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:32,801
Say hello, ladies,
to the new spokesperson

72
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,936
of an international airline.

73
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:36,985
Oh my gosh, Mrs. Rose!

74
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,632
You're gonna be in a commercial
for an airline?!

75
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,975
Radio, yes.

76
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,478
Voiceover work
is every actor's dream.

77
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:46,543
- Well, I'm glad you're happy.
- Thank you!

78
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,268
I have to admit, Mrs. Rose,

79
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:50,283
these past few weeks,

80
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,789
I feel like I've been waiting
on a famous person.

81
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,370
Twyla,

82
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:56,840
you're not waiting on
a famous person.

83
00:02:56,925 --> 00:02:58,861
She's already arrived!

84
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:06,001
- 'Kay, what's going on?
- Hey, guys, come on in!

85
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,137
Close the door.

86
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:08,493
Johnny, this better be good.

87
00:03:08,578 --> 00:03:11,153
I got a hot little BLT
over at the café

88
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,742
and I don't wanna keep her
waitin'.

89
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,513
I got some big news.

90
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:18,305
I've been, uh, reaching out
to some old business contacts

91
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,075
about potentially investing
in a motel franchise,

92
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,778
and I got a very positive
response today

93
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:26,674
from Mike Morrison,
my former assistant,

94
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:29,157
who's now a big venture
capitalist.

95
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,426
- Ooh, wow!
- Okay, so what does this mean?

96
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,029
More, more money?

97
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,671
Possibly.

98
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:38,841
I'm listening.

99
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:41,292
Well, I don't wanna put
the cart before the horse here,

100
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:44,374
but I have a feeling
this is a prospect

101
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,577
we can all get very excited
about!

102
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,312
But what does this mean?
Do they wanna invest?

103
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,552
Do they like the idea?

104
00:03:50,637 --> 00:03:52,117
Well, they haven't heard
the idea yet.

105
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,579
I gave him a teaser
in my last e-mail.

106
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,786
And, uh, we'll have to take
a meeting with him

107
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,556
and, you know,
do a formal pitch.

108
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,912
Sure. Well,
when's the meeting?

109
00:04:00,997 --> 00:04:03,216
We don't actually have
a meeting yet,

110
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,195
but he is calling today, so...

111
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,089
Johnny, I'm sorry,
I was so busy

112
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:09,799
being excited like you asked,

113
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,068
that, um, I think I missed
something here.

114
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,737
Do we have an investor
or do we have a meeting?

115
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,102
We might.

116
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,808
And I want you to keep this
information to yourself.

117
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:22,268
I don't want the family finding
out and getting their hopes up.

118
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:24,420
I'm pretty sure I can keep
this one to myself.

119
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,549
Okay. Yeah,
I don't know about me.

120
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,152
I mean, if the local papers
ask me about the rumour

121
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,987
that you might be getting
a phone call...

122
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,388
All right, all right,
you know what, Roland?

123
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,609
You can go and finish
your sandwich now.

124
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:36,289
Thank you.
And by the way, Johnny,

125
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:38,161
you should check to make sure
this place isn't bugged.

126
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,496
We wouldn't want the big news
to leak out!

127
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,189
It is big news...

128
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:45,084
probably.

129
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:50,295
Hi.

130
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:51,937
What, uh, um...

131
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:54,044
are those... sweatpants?

132
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,578
Yeah, I started getting
dressed for work

133
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,847
and I got distracted.

134
00:04:57,092 --> 00:04:58,733
What could have possibly
distracted you enough

135
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:01,774
- to do that to yourself?
- It died, David.

136
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,850
Okay, if you're talking
about your style,

137
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:05,254
we can bring it back to life.

138
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,790
Ted gave this to me.

139
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,792
It's like the one thing left
of our relationship

140
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,326
- and it's gone.
- 'Kay,

141
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,525
I would argue that you still
have your memories.

142
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,955
This weird little desert

143
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,471
- daisy thing...
- It's a succulent.

144
00:05:15,556 --> 00:05:18,128
Literally not supposed to die,
and yet it did.

145
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:20,358
Like what does that say
about me?

146
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:22,260
I think that's a longer
conversation.

147
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:25,350
But here's one thing
that'll make you feel good:

148
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:27,360
my bachelor party tonight.

149
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:29,684
I'm pretty sure I told Stevie
that I couldn't come,

150
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:32,321
or like I started sending her
an email saying that.

151
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:33,840
I don't know, I just...

152
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,071
I can't seem to do anything
right now.

153
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:38,541
Mm-hmm. I never thought
I'd have to say this,

154
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:40,165
but there is only space
in this family

155
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,505
for one unstable sibling,

156
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,342
and I have held that title
for a very long time,

157
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:46,698
so you are going to have
to get it together.

158
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,744
David, I don't have
a boyfriend anymore.

159
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:50,582
I'm like trying get my business
off the ground,

160
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,290
but honestly, like how many
people in this town

161
00:05:52,374 --> 00:05:55,053
need a publicist?
Like, what am I doing?

162
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,396
Well, as of 7:30 tonight,

163
00:05:58,481 --> 00:06:01,241
you will be thoroughly enjoying
yourself at my bachelor party.

164
00:06:01,387 --> 00:06:04,215
So, why don't you take a couple
of Mom's happy pills

165
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,256
and we can just put this
whole situation on ice

166
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:07,375
- until tomorrow?
- No, I can't.

167
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:09,743
I have to escort a client
to a meeting.

168
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,840
- Alexis!
- Ugh!

169
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,698
Are you almost ready,
dear?

170
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,375
The airline will not be
impressed

171
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,677
if we don't have an on-schedule
arrival at the studio.

172
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:22,197
Oh, David, is it all right
if I don't watch Panic Room

173
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,933
with everyone tonight?

174
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,302
Jo Foster once screened it
for me privately

175
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,670
and I would like to keep that
memory safe.

176
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:31,988
It's an escape room followed
by a really sad reception,

177
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,098
and everyone will be
participating.

178
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,810
Thank you so much!

179
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:39,261
- Stevie?
- Yeah?

180
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:42,543
I got this picture of David
back from the printer.

181
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,592
- I hope it's big enough.
- Oh my God, this is perfect!

182
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:47,928
Are you sure we can't move
the bachelor party

183
00:06:48,114 --> 00:06:50,499
to the motel here?
We can bring out some games,

184
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:53,095
and, you know, escape from...
one room to the other.

185
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,499
This is just a bad time
to be away from the business.

186
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,901
Ah... bachelor party, right?

187
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,503
Yeah, it's just for family.

188
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,773
Well, I think godfather
is part of the family,

189
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:04,931
is he not?

190
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:07,734
Roland, I need you manning
the phones.

191
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,979
Take it easy,
Johnny, okay?

192
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,115
Not that it's gonna happen,
but I'll come running

193
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,756
when Ike Morrison calls.

194
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:15,725
You mean Mike Morrison.

195
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,649
You're waiting on a call
from him, too?

196
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:19,746
That's the only call
I'm expecting.

197
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:23,350
No, you said you were waiting
on a call from "Ike" Morrison.

198
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:25,122
I don't know an Ike Morrison.

199
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:27,948
Mike Morrison was my assistant
for 3 years,

200
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,465
I think I know what
his name is.

201
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,656
Well, that's what I thought!

202
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,035
So I was confused when
a Mike Morrison called

203
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,571
after you said Ike Morrison...
Mike Morrison called?!

204
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,895
- Yeah.
- Well, give me the number!

205
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,938
You know, maybe this is why

206
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:42,078
Roland shouldn't be in charge
of phones.

207
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,469
Hey!

208
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:46,107
Hello? Oh, voicemail.

209
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:48,741
Uh, Mike, Mike.
Hi, it's Johnny Rose calling.

210
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:50,066
Sorry I didn't get your
message.

211
00:07:50,156 --> 00:07:53,343
Uh, a few technical
difficulties on our end,

212
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:56,025
but, uh, it's Johnny Rose
calling.

213
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,027
Uh, Johnny Rose calling
you back.

214
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,829
Uh, bye.

215
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,834
Oh, I don't know.
H-how did that sound?

216
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,003
Is there an option
to redo it?

217
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:07,528
Uh... no.

218
00:08:08,193 --> 00:08:10,312
- Yeah, it was fine.
- Okay.

219
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:12,112
I don't think you mentioned
your name.

220
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:18,253
<i>The copy's on
the stand.</i>

221
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:20,035
We'd like for you to read it
exactly as written.

222
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:22,737
Oh wow, a prolific amount
of material.

223
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:25,280
And I am being paid
for each spot, so hah!

224
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:28,273
Oh, uh, we agreed to a flat
rate with your publicist.

225
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:33,049
Well, there'll be nothing
flat about my performance.

226
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:36,199
Okay.
Whenever you're ready, Moira.

227
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:39,553
Just start at the top, and...
high energy.

228
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,218
Con brio, si!

229
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,637
"We really care...
at Larry Air."

230
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:47,373
I like that, it's snappy.

231
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,812
"We really care...
Just roll right through.

232
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:52,016
Just go on to the next line,
please.

233
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:55,499
"A deal so rare,
it's Larry Air."

234
00:08:56,965 --> 00:09:00,280
"Never flown Larry Air?
Try Larry Air."

235
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:03,358
Oh, that's a touch uninspired.
Alexis?

236
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:06,362
Alexis!
I'd rather not use that one.

237
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,665
Okay, so I'm being told just
to read through them all

238
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,200
and then we'll figure it out
after, okay?

239
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,354
And higher energy.

240
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:14,771
Higher...

241
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:17,640
"Get your
derriere on Larry Air..."

242
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,973
That's a bit chummy
for an airline.

243
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:22,677
Couldn't we maybe take a moment
to rework some of these?

244
00:09:22,884 --> 00:09:24,176
The client's not here.

245
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:26,021
It's my job just to get you
to say the words.

246
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,119
"Larry Air.

247
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,089
We'll take you from there...
to here..."

248
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:34,832
Now that should switched,
shouldn't it? You should...

249
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:37,392
Alexis, I can't work like this!

250
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,872
<i>No.</i>

251
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:41,645
Alexis!

252
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:44,132
I'm so sorry. This is like
the first offer I could get

253
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,669
after that whole "Sunrise Bay"
thing went down, and I...

254
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,069
I thought it would get you
back out there,

255
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:50,406
but I did not know that
it would be this.

256
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,879
Have I made a terrible
mistake, Alexis?

257
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:54,900
Is this the lowest point
of my life?

258
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:56,646
Okay, look who
you're talking to.

259
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:58,683
I haven't showered in like
two days.

260
00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:00,807
Is this the lowest point
of my life?

261
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,210
Thought you should know
that we can hear

262
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,235
your entire conversation.
Ooh... okay.

263
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,838
You should not have to do this,

264
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:09,891
so you start the car
and I will cover for you.

265
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,794
Oh, Alexis, no.

266
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,148
No, dear,

267
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:15,716
I could not let you do that
for me.

268
00:10:19,378 --> 00:10:20,957
Just hit "record".

269
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:25,030
"Try one
of our in-flight meals,

270
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:28,440
if you dare... at Larry Air."

271
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:33,263
I'm sorry, this is not...
this is not good, so.

272
00:10:34,496 --> 00:10:36,430
Hmm, hmm, hmm!

273

274
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:51,533
Okay, well, um, I would just
like to welcome everybody

275
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,136
to our... bachelor party.

276
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,572
Is anyone else not getting
a signal in here?

277
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,008
- I thought there were drinks.
- That's after.

278
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,878
Okay, how about half of us
do the escape room,

279
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,879
and then the other half of us
get a table at the bar?

280
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,815
Okay, how 'bout you shh
for a sec.

281
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,683
Now, this will all go a lot
smoother

282
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,152
if we just accept the fact

283
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,408
that this is something we
have to do, and that Patrick,

284
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:13,893
for some reason, thinks this
is gonna be... fun!

285
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:15,247
- Fun!
- Here he is.

286
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,465
Hi, hi, hi. Sorry, it took me
forever to find a spot.

287
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,529
- That's okay!
- Who's excited, huh?!

288
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,430
- Oh, hah-hah.
- Oh... huzzah.

289
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,143
So I guess you're all
wondering uh...

290
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:25,034
- what're we doing here?
- Hmm...

291
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,673
But, uh, the annual escape
room challenge

292
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:29,175
has been a Brewer family
tradition for a long time,

293
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,712
and I thought it could be fun
to share it with my new family,

294
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:33,782
since mine couldn't be here,
so.

295
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,716
Have they passed?

296
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:38,295
Well, I'm sure I speak for
all of us when I say

297
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,897
I hope we escape very quickly.

298
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:43,219
That's
the spirit, Mr. Rose. Yes.

299
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:45,777
<i>Players, are you
ready to enter the laboratory?</i>

300
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:47,256
Oh, I think so.

301
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,192
<i>Place all
electronic devices</i>

302

303
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,912
<i>and enter at your own risk.</i>

304
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:56,851
- Okay, here we go.
- Oh my God.

305
00:11:57,094 --> 00:11:58,627
<i>It's gonna be fun.</i>

312
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:16,281
This is a Galapagos-themed
room!

313
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:17,886
I didn't plan this part.

314
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,822
It was just called
"The Laboratory."

315
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,490
And I picked it
'cause it was the easiest.

316
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,559
<i>There are rumours
that Wallace's assistant</i>

317
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,028
<i>sides with Darwin
and may be willing to help</i>

318
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,231
if you get stuck.
There's our lucky break.

319
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:31,643
Assistant, show us the exit.

320
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:33,679
Don't worry,
I'm also in the Guild.

321
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,972
That's uh, that's not exactly
how it works, Mrs. Rose.

322
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,895
We do actually have
to try first.

323
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:42,394
Okay. So, the numbers for the
combination on Darwin's journal

324
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:45,032
are gonna be on finches
with red beaks.

325
00:12:45,117 --> 00:12:46,781
"Traveling east
to west,

326
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,168
the numbers on the beaks
will get you to the nest."

327
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:51,040
I have a compass on my phone.

328
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,177
Uh, when do we get our phones
back?

329
00:12:54,262 --> 00:12:56,125
Well, you don't actually need
a compass, Mr. Rose.

330
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,728
It's, uh, more like
a brain teaser.

331
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:01,464
So, uh, we'll cover more ground
if we pair off into teams.

332
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:05,134
So Stevie and Mr. Rose,
uh, Alexis and, and David,

333
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,870
and, uh, Mrs. Rose,
why don't you help me out?

334
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,339
Oh, I'd love nothing more,
Patrick.

335
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,141
Mrs. Rose, I'm sensing you
that you might be

336
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,185
a little bit distracted,

337
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,143
but unfortunately,
there is a time limit

338
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,126
on us getting out of here.

339
00:13:17,211 --> 00:13:20,330
Oh, I used to share your
philosophic optimism, dear,

340
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:22,067
but know the reality is,

341
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:24,136
we're never getting out
of here.

342
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:25,942
I wouldn't be so sure.

343
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:28,705
Just found a finch.

344
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,126
The first number is six,
people!

345
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:33,958
Okay. Okay, see this is why
I don't like mind games.

346
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:36,766
It puts you in a situation
where you're made to feel dumb,

347
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,895
even though you're not.

348
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,498
Like, some people's minds
just don't work like this.

349
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,968
Maybe I made a mistake?

350
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:43,902
I did tell you to wear
sensible heels today,

351
00:13:43,987 --> 00:13:45,802
and I'm not sure this outfit
is entirely appropriate.

352
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:48,080
No, I mean about not going
to the Galapagos.

353
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,146
Like I'm having a hard time
not taking this as a sign.

354
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,582
Okay, we're in a strip mall
on the side of the highway.

355
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,117
I really wouldn't read
into this.

356
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,721
Also, as stupid as this is,
I'm now invested.

357
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:00,663
You know, there was a time,
before we got here,

358
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:03,858
that I would've like gone
anywhere and done anything,

359
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,423
no questions asked.

360
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:07,860
Like, what if I'm just losing
my edge?

361
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,633
All right, if this'll help me
escape this conversation:

362
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:13,703
yes, it would have been
a mistake to go.

363
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:16,007
- Okay, go on.
- Well, what were you gonna do?

364
00:14:16,092 --> 00:14:17,877
Follow another guy around
the world?

365
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:19,480
Yeah, but what am I doing
here?

366
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:21,550
Setting Mom up with second-rate
radio gigs

367
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,078
for regional airlines?

368
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,349
'Kay, well, I don't know,
where do you wanna be then?

369
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:27,809
- There.
- Where?

370
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:30,461
No, the finch.
Second row, in the middle.

371
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:32,255
Trust me, Stavros and I used
to make out

372
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,699
in his parents' aviary.

373
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:35,368
Okay, we have the second
number!

374
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,642
The second number is eight!

375
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,597
'Kay, I'm gonna start looking
from the top here.

376
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:42,799
Excuse me, Assistant?

377
00:14:42,884 --> 00:14:44,966
Uh, any chance of getting
our phones back?

378
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,703
I know, I'm aware of
the no-phones situation,

379
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,038
but I need mine
for a business...

380
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,707
See, I don't know
what this means.

381
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,576
I heard a rumour you're on
our side,

382
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,711
and I'm, I'm waiting on
an important call.

383
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:56,779
<i>I found it!</i>

384
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,447
I found it!
I found the third finch.

385
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,783
- Okay. Okay!
- It's four, David. Four.

386
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,467
6-8-4.
Okay!

387
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,720
Six...

388
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:06,786
eight...

389
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,255
<i>four...</i>

390
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,058
Ah-hah-hah!

391
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,349
Ahh! Ahhh!

392
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:13,129
- Woo!
- Yes!

393
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:16,374
'Kay. It says "natural
selection."

394
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:18,252
- Ahh!
Oh my God!

395
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:20,856
Well, good work, team!
Now who's driving me to drinks?

396
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:23,392
Outta my way! Outta my way!

397
00:15:25,013 --> 00:15:26,932
Okay, there's no key in here.
There is no key in here.

398
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:28,467
That's just the first puzzle,
David.

399
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,622
It's a series of puzzles.

400
00:15:29,706 --> 00:15:31,958
- What?!
- Wait, wait, everyone!

401
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,579
<i>I hear my phone ringing.</i>

402
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:35,483
That's the phone
I was talking about.

403
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,954
So if I could just leave
the lab for one minute...

404
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,289
<i>You have 52 minutes
to escape.</i>

405
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,657
52 minutes!

406
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,692
Hey, David, everyone heard
the time, all right?

407
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,629
52, people!
Let's go! Come on!

408
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,299
Blow on them, David! You have
to blow on the circles, David!

409
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,301
You have to blow on the circles
until they're blue.

410
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,840
- I'm blowing!
- Blow harder, David!

411
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:56,311
Oh my God, you blow on them!
You blow on the circles then!

412
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:59,047
Use this! Use this thing!

413
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:01,449
- 'Kay, this is a good idea.
- 'Kay. Oh!

414
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:02,755
- Oh my God!
- Yes!

415
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,547
- Oh my God!
- Yes! Ahhh! Yes!

416
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,050
One more! One more!

417
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,485
Yay!

418
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:10,920
It didn't do anything.

419
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,552
Oh! Oh! It's uh...

420
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:15,489
- What is that?
- It's a flashlight?

421
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,625
Oh yeah! Oh my God,
this game is actually fun.

422
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,065
See? I told you!

423
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,875
You're only saying that
because you got one right!

424
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,370
Oh, your time will come,
David.

425
00:16:22,455 --> 00:16:25,810
- Please just give us the key.
- The key, or our phones!

426
00:16:25,895 --> 00:16:27,513
Either way!
No, the key!

427
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,204
John, what is this newfound
obsession with your device?

428
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,213
Dad, what's the big deal
with the phone?

429
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:34,980
Just tell them, Mr. Rose.

430
00:16:35,158 --> 00:16:37,877
Okay. Well, I didn't want
to get ahead of myself,

431
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:41,349
but I'm waiting on a call
from my old assistant.

432
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:44,687
And we may have a meeting
to get an investor

433
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:46,587
for the Rosebud Motel Group.

434
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,626
Well, John, what,
what does this mean?

435
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:52,493
Well, potentially, there
could be a big influx of money

436
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,897
to turn Rosebud Motels into a...

437
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:57,017
- into a full franchise.
- Oh!

438
00:16:57,185 --> 00:16:59,860
Well, why didn't you say
this before? Get the phone!

439
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,171
Oh, I don't know. we're
almost finished the game, so.

440
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,907
- You can use my phone, John!
- You still have your phone?!

441
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,090
We all have our phones!

442
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:09,282
Well, his number's in
my phone

443
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:11,285
and my phone I can't get

444
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,863
unless I get outta this
damn room!

445
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:15,651
<i>Okay, I've used
the clues</i>

446
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,070
to turn the dials
on the flashlight,

447
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:18,247
and it spells out England.

448
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:20,835
So, thank you, my weekend
with Tom Hardy...

449
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:23,400
England is here.

450
00:17:23,485 --> 00:17:24,869
It says something.

451
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,255
"I'm tall when I'm young
and short when I'm old."

452
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:31,024
Candle.

453
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,111
How are you doing this?

454
00:17:33,196 --> 00:17:35,003
What?

455
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:38,741
- Laser. Laser's pointing at...
- Okay, I got this, Patrick.

456
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:42,019
Okay, this is an ancient
Egyptian symbol for stability.

457
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,746
My friend Prairie got one
tattooed on her lower-back

458
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,047
- in seventh grade.
- Okay,

459
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,458
what does that mean?!

460
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:48,675
It means that we need to find
something from Egypt.

461
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,294
So like mummies, Rami Malek,
a...

462
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:54,293
a pyramid.

463
00:17:54,393 --> 00:17:55,911
What?!

464
00:17:55,996 --> 00:17:59,400
- And there it is.
- Try it in the door!

465
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:03,899
<i>Congratulations!</i>

466
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,812
<i>You have outwitted Darwin's
nemesis...</i>

467
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:08,743
Ah! Mummy and Alexis
solved the puzzle!

468
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,798
- How did she do that?
- I dunno.

469
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:14,347
I don't know
how you did that.

470
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:16,217
That was actually pretty
impressive, Alexis.

471
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:18,180
Thanks! I just like wanted
to get to the drinks.

472
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,248
- Uh-huh.
- Congratulations!

473
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,017
Professor Darwin would be
very proud.

474
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,052
Can I just have my phone,
please?

475
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,736
<i>Thank you.</i>

476
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:30,858
- Okay.
- Four voicemails!

477
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,461
- Yes?
- Put it on speaker!

478
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:33,929
Okay, is that the button
with the arrow?

479
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,798
That's the button that says
"speaker"!

480
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,551
- Speaker button!
- Ooh!

481
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:39,219
<i>"John,
call me when you can.</i>

482
00:18:39,304 --> 00:18:41,464
<i>We need an excuse to get out
of the escape room thing."</i>

483
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,672
- Okay, skip that. Skip it.
- I have something...

484
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,540
"Hi, just reminding you
that you can't bail

485
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,410
<i>on the escape room thing,
even though all of us want..."</i>

486
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:48,746
Yeah, I don't think we need
to keep...

487
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,081
I actually wanna hear
that one.

488
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,384
- I don't think so.
- "Johnny,

489
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:54,054
<i>it's Mike Morrison,
returning your call."</i>

490
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:55,456
- This is it!
- "Just read your proposal

491
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,392
<i>and I think it's a solid idea,
my friend.</i>

492
00:18:57,477 --> 00:18:59,329
<i>Would absolutely love to take
a meeting.</i>

493
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:01,265
<i>Let's say 4pm Tuesday
at the New York office?"</i>

494
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,968
Oh my Go

495
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:04,338
- Did I just hear that?
- Oh, John!

496
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:06,761
Did I just... is that what
he just said?!

497
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,898
Oh my God!

498
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,168
Oh!

499
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,581
We got a meeting!

500
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,551
Oh-ho-ho!
Yeah!

501
00:19:15,636 --> 00:19:17,386
- Why am I still holding this?
- Okay, okay.

502
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:19,578
Thank you!
We got a meeting!

503
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,014
So, for someone who is
all about signs,

504
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:30,519
what do you think it meant
that you were the one

505
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,455
that got us out of
the Galapagos?

506
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,590
Honestly? Like...

507
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,525
being in a high-pressure
situation,

508
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,461
with time running out and a lot
of people yelling at me,

509
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:41,931
it just like... made me feel
like myself again.

510
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,265
Well, mission accomplished.

511
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,467
And you're out of your
sweatpants,

512
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,270
so things are looking up.

513
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,749
I think it might be time
to let go of that succulent.

514
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,831
Okay, I've been thinking
about that.

515
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:56,534
Do you think that maybe it died

516
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:58,886
because it outgrew
its little pot?

517
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:01,735
No, I watched you slowly
kill it.

518
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:04,354
Like maybe it realized
that it...

519
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:07,165
missed the bigger pots
that it used to grow in...

520
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,959
and maybe it can't live up
to its full potential

521
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,032
in such a small space?

522
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:17,626
David, I'm starting to feel
that I'm a lot like the plant.

523
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,326
I was tracking the metaphor,

524
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:21,502
but um...

525
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,783
what're you saying?

526
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,837
I don't know.
Like maybe it's time

527
00:20:26,922 --> 00:20:29,026
I think about being
somewhere else,

528
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:32,649
finding a bigger pot
to grow in.

529
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,251
Oh...

530
00:20:38,743 --> 00:20:41,228
<i>Before we find
ourselves ebrious</i>

531
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:44,026
with hooch and happiness,

532
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:48,690
may I say how very proud all
of us are on this day of days.

533
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,799
Well, we did say no speeches,
so...

534
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,534
- Your father...
- Guess they listened.

535
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:56,121
With his pecuniary savvy
and intrepidation

536
00:20:56,206 --> 00:21:00,599
has turned what began as
a katzenjammer of a day

537
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,508
into one filled with faith,

538
00:21:03,677 --> 00:21:06,080
hope and love.

539
00:21:06,385 --> 00:21:08,837
<i>Well, thank you,
Sweetheart.</i>

540
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:11,624
Well, I think we have
forgotten why we're here.

541
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:13,994
It is our bachelor party.

542
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,118
Also, whoever chose
those photos,

543
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:18,550
they were not approved.

543

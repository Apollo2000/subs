1
00:00:04,908 --> 00:00:07,276
Moira: John! Are you awake?

2
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:09,846
- John!
- What? What's happening?

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,664
Your wayfaring thespian has returned!

4
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:15,394
I-I don't wanna jinx anything,

5
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:17,720
but the shoot was a triumph.

6
00:00:17,755 --> 00:00:20,456
The local Bosnians are calling
it a stunning re-invigoration

7
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:22,558
of the "Crows Have Eyes" franchise.

8
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:24,594
That, of course, is a loose translation.

9
00:00:24,628 --> 00:00:26,929
Oh, well that sounds
great, sweetheart.

10
00:00:26,964 --> 00:00:29,632
John, no need to
get out of bed, dear.

11
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,502
I'm sure you considered
planning a little more fanfare

12
00:00:32,527 --> 00:00:34,194
for my return, but...

13
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:36,639
oh, it's best to ease back in.

14
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:38,207
It's 3:30 in the morning,

15
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:41,236
you said you were
coming in today at noon.

16
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:44,247
Yes! Noon Bosnian
Mountain Time, that is!

17
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:46,482
Which was several hours ago, John.

18
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:48,985
Oh, and what a journey it has been!

19
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:50,887
Production had me routed through Nairobi

20
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:53,189
for some reason, and then
our plane was grounded

21
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:55,758
after flying through a swarm of locusts.

22
00:00:55,793 --> 00:00:57,660
I didn't want to miss
my third connection,

23
00:00:57,694 --> 00:01:00,696
so I took a Bosnian
upper just to keep awake.

24
00:01:00,731 --> 00:01:02,242
Those things are the size of a nickel,

25
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:03,866
so I only took one,

26
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:05,101
at least, I think I did.

27
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:06,913
I may have taken a second
one just to be safe,

28
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:10,106
because I don't know if I
took that first one, or not.

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,875
Either way, I've been up
since eight am three days ago,

30
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,277
with time changes factored in,

31
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,379
and I couldn't be happier to see you!

32
00:01:16,413 --> 00:01:17,680
Oh!

33
00:01:17,714 --> 00:01:20,917
Well Moira, it sounds
like a nightmare of a trip.

34
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:22,919
Why don't we leave the
unpacking 'til tomorrow,

35
00:01:22,953 --> 00:01:25,221
and just get some rest?

36
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:26,486
Good idea.

37
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:28,658
Kids!

38
00:01:28,692 --> 00:01:30,660
- No Moira, it's 3:30.
- David!

39
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:32,261
Alexis!

40
00:01:33,363 --> 00:01:35,131
- Oh! Who is it?
- Oh my God, what?!

41
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:38,501
I don't know what you kids
are still doing up so late.

42
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:40,169
I didn't want to disturb you,

43
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:43,039
I just wanted you to know that
Mummy got home safe and sound!

44
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:44,273
- Okay, good night.
- Great.

45
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:46,175
Okay, if you insist, one quick story.

46
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,744
So, day three of shooting, Hamza and I

47
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:51,347
find ourselves stuck in a hail storm...

48
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:52,792
Oh my God, not tonight,
thank you, though.

49
00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:55,651
I'm sorry kids, your mother's
had a rough couple of days.

50
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:58,154
Moira, why don't we
get to bed, sweetheart?

51
00:01:58,188 --> 00:01:59,956
Ooh, frisky, John.

52
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,458
- Oh! Bye!
- Ewww!

53
00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:05,194
- Eww.
- Ugh!

54
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:09,765

55
00:02:10,808 --> 00:02:13,910
Moira: No! No one would believe this!

56
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:15,992
These cannot be real!

57
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:18,521
What's going on?

58
00:02:18,976 --> 00:02:20,743
Well, instead of sleeping last night,

59
00:02:20,777 --> 00:02:22,678
I decided to just power right through.

60
00:02:22,713 --> 00:02:24,647
You know, best to round
up to an even four days.

61
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:27,517
And while I was doing
some light reorganization,

62
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:30,553
I came upon this stack of love letters

63
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:33,210
written to your father by another woman.

64
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,293
- Okay.
- Best not to be concerned, Alexis.

65
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:40,763
I'm sure there's a logical
explanation for all of this.

66
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:43,232
- Sure there is.
- Yes. Some of them!

67
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:45,067
Some of them are even funny!

68
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:47,904
Listen. Where's that one? Oh! Read this.

69
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,344
"Dearest John-John,

70
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,613
I'm lying here, stuck, sweaty.

71
00:02:57,648 --> 00:02:59,615
All I can think about is you,

72
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,183
and the last night we spent together,

73
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:02,725
bed shaking... " Ew!

74
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,083
Why are you making me read this?

75
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:05,788
- I know, right?
- Eugh!

76
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:07,423
Before your father met me,

77
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:09,091
he was not quite so selective.

78
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:11,727
I hesitate to add, he
even had a predilection

79
00:03:11,762 --> 00:03:13,863
for boom boom girls!

80
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:15,464
Okay, I would like to remind you

81
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:17,433
that I don't have a therapist anymore.

82
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:18,968
No, as you said,

83
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:21,337
there's a logical
explanation for all of this.

84
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:24,373
No, you've said that
like, three times now.

85
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:26,208
So I think it's probably for the best

86
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:28,932
that we put these down,
and we go have a nap, okay?

87
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:30,746
- Yes. You're right.
- Mhm.

88
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:33,316
You're right, Alexis,
you're always so right.

89
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:37,219
Okay.

90
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:40,189
All right...

91
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,062
Just a few more, just
to lull me to sleep.

92
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:47,286
That's all.

93

94
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:57,249
Good morning.

95
00:03:57,441 --> 00:03:59,108
Is there something I can help you with?

96
00:03:59,142 --> 00:04:00,820
Yeah, I'd like you to
open your cash register,

97
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:02,345
and give me your money!

98
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,020
Okay, small problem.

99
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:07,106
Um, our money isn't for sale.

100
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:10,629
- I'm robbing you!
- Thought so, yeah. Um...

101
00:04:10,654 --> 00:04:12,965
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

102
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,425
Hey! Hey! Where do you
think you're going?!

103
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,428
- Here.
- David: So here's the problem.

104
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:21,430
Our till doesn't currently
have any cash in it,

105
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:22,642
because my partner is at the bank

106
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,002
getting money for the float.

107
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:26,636
What about you, what do you have?

108
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,379
A wallet full of debt.

109
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:31,474
Can someone put
something in a bag, please?!

110
00:04:31,508 --> 00:04:33,776
Um, we only have cloth
totes, I hope that's okay.

111
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,778
- Whatever!
- Would you like some wine?

112
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:38,047
Okay, yeah, yes, put
some booze in a bag.

113
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:40,016
Do you drink red wine, or white wine?

114
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,118
Maybe some chilled rose in the back?

115
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:43,038
I'll get it!

116
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:44,864
Robber: I'm not letting
you go into the back!

117
00:04:44,888 --> 00:04:46,756
What else?

118
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,158
Cheese goes good with wine.

119
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:50,860
Suddenly she's a sales associate.

120
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:52,461
Would you like some cheese?

121
00:04:52,496 --> 00:04:54,563
Uh yeah, I'll take some cheese.

122
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:55,642
God forbid he be specific.

123
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,800
I guess throw in some brie,

124
00:04:57,834 --> 00:04:59,135
some aged cheddar.

125
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:01,203
Uh, that tapenade goes
good with the brie.

126
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:02,838
Tapenades, great, yeah, yeah, yeah.

127
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:05,878
- Do you have bad skin?
- Yeah, sure, just hurry it up!

128
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,251
There you go.

129
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:16,295
Could you help the man with the door?

130
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:18,130
- His hands are full.
- Sorry.

131
00:05:18,155 --> 00:05:20,523
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

132
00:05:24,153 --> 00:05:25,953
Why do I feel like
we did something wrong?

133
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:33,836
Look at you all dressed
up, Mr. Sporty Spice.

134
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,871
Uh yeah, I'm dressed for the run

135
00:05:35,906 --> 00:05:37,250
that we're supposed to be going on,

136
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:40,088
but I don't think you can run in those.

137
00:05:40,477 --> 00:05:43,479
Tell that to me at
21, escaping the yakuza.

138
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:45,205
So that's a no on the run, then?

139
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,826
Okay, honestly Ted,
I've had a very traumatic

140
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,884
morning at home, so
going on a run is like,

141
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,121
the last thing that I
wanna do. Also, I forgot.

142
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:53,889
Okay well, that's
actually like, scary,

143
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:56,092
because we texted about
it twice last night,

144
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:59,095
and twice this morning, but anyway,

145
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,629
is everything okay?

146
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:02,575
Like, other than reading
some very porny love letters

147
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:04,967
that someone sent my dad, sure.

148
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,869
Like, who holds on to things like that?

149
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:08,938
I've held on to some things.

150
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:10,606
Oh my God, should I be worried?

151
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,475
Well, I, I did keep this waterproof watch

152
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:13,951
that Heather gave me.

153
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:16,472
Okay, I asked if I should be worried.

154
00:06:17,414 --> 00:06:18,891
I don't know, I think
it's kind of romantic

155
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:20,783
to hang on to things
from old relationships.

156
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:23,452
I've certainly kept some
things from our past.

157
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:26,555
Ted!

158
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,136
I take it that you haven't?

159
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:31,761
Um, harsh. I for sure have.

160
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:33,963
Yeah, it's just
that your face is doing

161
00:06:33,997 --> 00:06:35,308
some really weird stuff right now.

162
00:06:35,332 --> 00:06:37,967
No... because you put me on the spot!

163
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:40,536
There's like, a very long
list of things that I've kept.

164
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,338
Oh, really.

165
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:43,806
Like what?

166
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,443
Like... that empty
book that you gave me.

167
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,413
- The journal?
- Yes! The journal.

168
00:06:51,448 --> 00:06:55,961
And very likely some jewelry.

169
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:59,965
Like a ring, or...

170
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,525
- A locket?
- Yes.

171
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:04,426
The locket you gave me.

172
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:06,028
I kept that the most.

173
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:07,163
Oh yeah, it's just funny,

174
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:08,898
I don't think I've
ever seen you wear it.

175
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:11,400
I'm just so scared of losing it.

176
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:13,102
That makes sense.

177
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:15,204
Okay, well, you have a run to go on,

178
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:18,974
so I should probably go
and update my journal.

179
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,453
You've never written
in a journal, have you?

180
00:07:20,477 --> 00:07:22,077
No, but um,

181
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:24,046
one time I did do a book
report on David's diary,

182
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:26,239
and it was very dark. Okay.

183
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,857
Jocelyn!

184
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:36,959
Moira, you're back.

185
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:38,894
Did you just let yourself in?

186
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:41,230
I have been knocking on your door

187
00:07:41,264 --> 00:07:43,032
since the beginning of time!

188
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,377
Although now that I'm standing here,

189
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:46,402
it's equally possible
that I didn't knock at all.

190
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:48,170
I suppose we'll never know, will we?

191
00:07:48,196 --> 00:07:50,573
Ah! Sorry. I just need to...

192
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:53,142
- catch my breath.
- Oh, as do I.

193
00:07:53,176 --> 00:07:55,477
I don't know if you know
what it's like to be mortally

194
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:57,546
deprived of one's sleep!

195
00:07:57,581 --> 00:07:59,481
I haven't slept in eight months.

196
00:07:59,516 --> 00:08:02,117
- Why's that?
- Because of the baby.

197
00:08:02,152 --> 00:08:04,987
I've had a bit of a
rebirth myself, in Bosnia.

198
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:07,056
I hope it wasn't as painful as mine.

199
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,624
The music, Jocelyn.

200
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:12,221
In Bosni-wood, as the industry
will soon be calling it,

201
00:08:12,762 --> 00:08:16,131
I... I picked up some beautiful Sevdah,

202
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,969
that I absolutely must
teach to the Jazzigals!

203
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:21,837
Would you like to hear me sing

204
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:23,775
a traditional love song?

205
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,508
I - I would, it's just
the baby's sleeping, so...

206
00:08:26,543 --> 00:08:28,577
Shhh...

207
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:50,324
Yeah... it's a sad one.

208
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:54,169
I would be feeling it too, if I knew...

209
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:56,448
what the heck you were singing about.

210
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:00,229
Oh...

211
00:09:01,878 --> 00:09:02,878
What are these?

212
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:06,448
Oh, just some old love letters,

213
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:07,917
written by another woman,

214
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:10,786
onto which John has been clutching.

215
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,112
Wow, I have been down this road.

216
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:18,827
I once found a bag of
Roland's ex-girlfriends' bras.

217
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:21,284
Burned them.

218
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:23,666
Except for the ones that were my size.

219
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,734
But this is incomparable, Jocelyn,

220
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:29,905
there's a perfectly logical
explanation for this!

221
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,573
Oh, there always is.

222
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:35,077
Woo! Wow.

223
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:38,414
This little "butterfly"
is quite the writer.

224
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:41,483
It's like 50 Shades of Johnny Rose!

225
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:43,052
Holy cow.

226
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:48,757
You know, I've never
been robbed before,

227
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:50,526
and I had friends
that lived in Brooklyn.

228
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,829
Yeah... that was a robbery, right?

229
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:56,532
I mean, we were robbed.

230
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:58,032
Right?
Yeah!

231
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:00,235
Someone walked out of here
with two bags of product,

232
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,371
I mean, I don't know
what else you'd call it.

233
00:10:03,473 --> 00:10:06,041
I mean, he had a weapon, right?

234
00:10:06,076 --> 00:10:08,077
Yeah! Yes.

235
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:09,745
I mean, it must've been in his pocket,

236
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,547
because he used both
hands to carry the bags

237
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:13,282
out of the store, but...

238
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:19,388
I can't believe you
just offered him the wine.

239
00:10:19,422 --> 00:10:20,766
You offered him the skincare, I mean,

240
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,435
we don't know what was
going on under that mask!

241
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:24,326
He could've had perfect skin.

242
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:25,728
I can't believe this happened,

243
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:27,628
I was gone for like, 45 minutes.

244
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:30,440
Are you guys sure you're okay?

245
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:32,210
Surprisingly, yes.

246
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:33,769
- Yeah, I'm not.
- Thanks.

247
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:35,537
I'm very startled.

248
00:10:35,572 --> 00:10:36,682
It just doesn't make any sense.

249
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:38,707
I mean, I can understand
taking the wine,

250
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:41,730
but who steals a jar of tapenade?

251
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:44,980
- And the brie?!
- Yeah, the brie.

252
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:47,216
Stevie? The brie?

253
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,819
Well, at least we know
if the cops don't get him,

254
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:52,862
his cholesterol will.

255
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:54,700
Well, there's no need to
keep talking about it now.

256
00:10:54,724 --> 00:10:56,702
You guys are gonna have to
go through this all again

257
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:58,627
in much more detail
when the police get here.

258
00:11:00,228 --> 00:11:01,565
Yeah, I um,

259
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:03,766
I don't know if going
to the police is...

260
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,968
is necessary at this point.

261
00:11:06,002 --> 00:11:07,503
If we want any insurance money

262
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:08,781
for the things that were stolen,

263
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:10,620
you have to explain
everything to the police.

264
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:12,908
I was pretty much in the back

265
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:14,370
while all of this was going down, so...

266
00:11:14,544 --> 00:11:17,611
Mm, I remember you being
pretty involved, actually.

267
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,881
Yeah well, between the two of you,

268
00:11:18,915 --> 00:11:20,816
I'm pretty sure you
can piece it together.

269
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,485
Yeah. Right? So...

270
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:33,955
Hey, Twy?

271
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,191
I've always admired your jewelry game.

272
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:37,469
You just like, pick a few pieces,

273
00:11:37,493 --> 00:11:39,761
and just and wear them to death.

274
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:42,164
Oh, if you're talking about
my earrings the clasp broke,

275
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:45,233
so I actually physically
cannot take them off.

276
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:47,769
Okay, I am experiencing
the same problem.

277
00:11:47,804 --> 00:11:49,980
All of my jewelry is boring.

278
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:51,773
Is that what I said?

279
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:54,309
So way back when, all
of my girlfriends and I

280
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:56,188
used to throw the diamonds
we got from our parents

281
00:11:56,212 --> 00:11:59,047
on a table, and just do
like, a big jewelry swap.

282
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,049
I wish I had someone
in this town to swap with.

283
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:04,908
Yeah, I used to think
that a lot growing up,

284
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,043
when I'd see other kids
with their families.

285
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,080
Okay, you just gave me a great idea!

286
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:12,516
Why don't we do a jewelry swap?

287
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:15,218
Well, I do have a large collection

288
00:12:15,253 --> 00:12:17,020
of my grandfather's hospital bracelets.

289
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:19,623
Yum! Um, but I also love

290
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,791
that cute little
locket around your neck.

291
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:22,959
Well, that makes sense,

292
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:24,505
because you gave it to me for Christmas,

293
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:26,196
and I wear it every day.

294
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,164
Yeah, and I always think like,

295
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:29,966
what would I look like in it?

296
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,219
S... so do you want the locket?

297
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:35,279
No, Twy, I got it for you.

298
00:12:35,573 --> 00:12:38,041
But what I'm saying
is, let's swap for it.

299
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:40,944
I have a toe ring that
would look so cute on you!

300
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:45,050
We're not allowed to wear
open-toed shoes, but um...

301
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:47,217
maybe I could...

302
00:12:47,242 --> 00:12:48,910
take that bracelet?

303
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:54,031
Yes! Um, I actually got this
in a swap with Sienna Miller.

304
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:56,626
And by that I mean it fell off
her wrist at a Halloween party,

305
00:12:56,661 --> 00:12:58,161
and I kept it.

306
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,894
Well, maybe I could come
over on my lunch break,

307
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,653
and we can swap some more stuff!

308
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:04,234
Yes, Twy!

309
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:05,746
I mean, I actually
thought this would be like,

310
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,237
a one-for-one situation,

311
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:09,205
but if you want to open it up...

312
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,218
- Let me help you with that.
- Oh, that's okay, I got it.

313
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:13,402
No, the necklace.

314
00:13:14,178 --> 00:13:15,979
Oh, right now?

315
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,004
Okay...

316
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,458
- What are you doing?
- Uh...

317
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:30,226
word on the street is that

318
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:32,753
you're in a little hot
water with Moira, huh?

319
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:35,332
No, everything's fine with Moira.

320
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:37,601
I just thought she was coming in today.

321
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:41,004
Look Johnny, everybody likes
to take trips down memory lane,

322
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:44,174
but you gotta get rid of the evidence.

323
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,142
Do you know what a burnt
under-wire smells like?

324
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:47,184
Okay, Roland,

325
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,613
I actually don't know
what you're talking about.

326
00:13:49,647 --> 00:13:51,982
Those spicy letters
from Miss Butterfly

327
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:54,117
that you left out for Moira to find.

328
00:13:54,151 --> 00:13:56,186
How do you know about those letters?

329
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,788
Well, Moira's out
showing 'em around town.

330
00:13:58,823 --> 00:14:00,290
Jocelyn's read 'em.

331
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:03,827
She told me about some
very racy parts, young man.

332
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:05,795
Moira is showing my letters?

333
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,174
Yeah, I was talking to Bob about it.

334
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:09,399
Why were you talking to Bob about it?!

335
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,801
We're trying to save
your marriage, bud!

336
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:14,137
Although, Gwen thinks
it's probably a lost cause.

337
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:16,406
She's thinks you might be a sexaholic.

338
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,540
Okay, first of all,

339
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:19,209
everyone should mind their own business,

340
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:20,877
and stay out of my affairs.

341
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:23,213
Affairs, plural? Oh.

342
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,914
There's no affair, okay?

343
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:27,117
Now, would you unlock the
door, and open the blind?

344
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:30,220
Jeez, Johnny, I'm on your side, pal.

345
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:31,888
Unless things get messy,

346
00:14:31,922 --> 00:14:33,823
in that case, I'm gonna
be on Moira's side.

347
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:38,762
So I guess it was sort of like a...

348
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:41,097
a low end poly-blend hooded sweatshirt,

349
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:44,393
in what I could only describe
as an aubergine color.

350
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,170
And just in case
he changes his outfit,

351
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:50,507
do you have a rough idea
of his physical description?

352
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,475
Right, um...

353
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,642
Well, I guess, my build.

354
00:14:55,112 --> 00:14:57,380
- That's being generous.
- If I was at my goal weight.

355
00:14:57,415 --> 00:14:59,735
Officer, they mentioned
there was a weapon involved.

356
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:01,918
Can you describe the weapon?

357
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:03,319
You describe it.

358
00:15:03,354 --> 00:15:06,756
Well, if there was a
weapon, it was concealed.

359
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,492
Yeah, so you know, it's...
it's sort of hard to describe

360
00:15:09,527 --> 00:15:11,361
a concealed weapon.

361
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:14,731
Yeah, I mean, if we could
tell you what it looked like,

362
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:17,167
he wouldn't be doing a
good job of concealing it.

363
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:18,401
Yeah!

364
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:20,070
So let me get this straight.

365
00:15:20,104 --> 00:15:21,805
You have no idea what it looks like,

366
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,240
or whether there was
one in the first place.

367
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:26,076
You guys said you were held up!

368
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,544
Emotionally!

369
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:29,179
I mean, I don't know if there was a gun,

370
00:15:29,213 --> 00:15:31,347
but it was still a robbery,
he was wearing a mask.

371
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:34,884
And would we all not agree
that words are weapons?!

372
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,854
Okay, so you offered the wine,

373
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:39,923
and you offered the
cheese and the tapenade,

374
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:41,386
and there was no gun?

375
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:43,955
This guy just sounds like
a lucky customer, David!

376
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:46,262
You know what? I am just gonna...

377
00:15:46,297 --> 00:15:48,732
file this report, and you can follow up

378
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:51,092
if you have any more information.

379
00:15:52,336 --> 00:15:53,870
Yes...

380
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:00,706
So you upsold the robber.

381
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:03,413
I did not! I didn't even tell him

382
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:06,182
about the vintage wines
we have in the back.

383
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:07,517
Oh. Stevie: Speaking of...

384
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:10,353
I think we should probably
open one of those bottles,

385
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,555
just to calm the nerves.

386
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,447
Yeah, I thought
you had to go to work.

387
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:19,335
Great. Great stuff, you guys.

388
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:25,345
- Can I have some more popcorn?
- Oh, sure.

389
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:27,103
Oh, don't worry, I'll get it.

390
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:32,575
I uh, see you're wearing the locket.

391
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,577
Oh! I don't know, am I?

392
00:16:34,612 --> 00:16:36,012
Oh, right.

393
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:39,215
Well, you proved me wrong, Alexis.

394
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,727
And I have to say, I'm
actually kind of relieved,

395
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,729
because that means that you
also kept favourite photo

396
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,053
of the two of us.

397
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:47,023
I keep that photo in a
locked folder on my phone.

398
00:16:47,057 --> 00:16:49,125
No, no, I'm talking
about the one in the locket.

399
00:16:52,063 --> 00:16:53,490
Hmm!

400
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:58,592
Now, this appears to
be a photo of Twyla?

401
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:01,471
Yes... I put that there.

402
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,208
Because Twyla is an important friend.

403
00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:07,399
And Twyla's mom?

404
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,045
Is her important friend.

405
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,757
You gave the locket
to Twyla, didn't you?

406
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:12,415
Okay, I would've kept it.

407
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,860
But the necklace just kept reminding me

408
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:15,518
of all the bad things that I'd done,

409
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:16,797
and then Twyla gave me a Christmas gift,

410
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:18,298
and I didn't have
anything to give her...

411
00:17:18,322 --> 00:17:20,690
Okay, Alexis, I think
we should just agree

412
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:22,625
to stop feeling bad about our past,

413
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,341
and just focus on the future.

414
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:26,556
Yes, Ted.

415
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:28,541
And, in that spirit,

416
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:30,967
I should probably tell you
that I didn't actually keep

417
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:32,969
everything that you gave me.

418
00:17:33,003 --> 00:17:34,137
That's fine.

419
00:17:34,171 --> 00:17:36,172
Yeah, after the breakup, I uh...

420
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:38,408
well, I took some of your
stuff to the incinerator,

421
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:40,810
along with some pets that
needed to be cremated.

422
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:42,645
- Ew.
- And you think you feel bad?

423
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,157
The wallet that you gave
me was still in there,

424
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:45,926
and I had forgotten to
take some of the cards out,

425
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,786
and I was actually only one
stamp away from a free sub, so.

426
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,755
Okay well, if it makes
you feel any better,

427
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,591
that was David's wallet.

428
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,740
Well, well, "John-John" returns.

429
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,236
Okay, Moira, don't tell
me you still haven't slept.

430
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,837
What would give you that impression?

431
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:09,639
Sweetheart, you've got to find a way

432
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,541
of getting some sleep!

433
00:18:11,575 --> 00:18:13,109
Easier said than done, John,

434
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:14,844
when your only husband is longing for

435
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:17,447
his epistle-writing inamorata.

436
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:19,025
You know what, if
you had taken a nap,

437
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:20,717
and cleared your head,

438
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:22,385
instead of running around town

439
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:24,621
showcasing our personal business...

440
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:26,856
When we were herded from our home,

441
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:30,159
and forced to grab what
few precious items we could,

442
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:32,372
you chose to grab those letters!

443
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,796
- That's right.
- Who is this woman?!

444
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,380
Oh... okay.

445
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:40,303
If you must know,

446
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:44,177
she's someone who's
very important to me.

447
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:45,948
Oh?

448
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:48,778
Moira, you wrote those letters!

449
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:51,381
Don't be absurd,
that is not my writing!

450
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:53,483
It was that week on "Sunrise Bay"

451
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:55,385
when Vivian Blake had her accident,

452
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:58,187
you were in a body cast, they
wouldn't let you take it off.

453
00:18:58,212 --> 00:19:00,482
You were writing with your left hand!

454
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:03,059
The spelunking incident.

455
00:19:03,084 --> 00:19:03,950
No.

456
00:19:04,654 --> 00:19:08,431
It was after she got thrown
upwards through a skylight.

457
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:10,435
Look...

458
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,235
"I'm lying here in bed,

459
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:14,671
I can't move, I miss you."

460
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:15,872
It's all there, Moira.

461
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,107
You're telling me none
of this rings a bell?

462
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,410
In my defense, John,

463
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:22,245
I had asked for actual painkillers,

464
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:25,169
to help ease me into
my character's plight.

465
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:28,485
But why are you reading them now?

466
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:33,716
I was missing you,

467
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:35,692
so I took out the letters,

468
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:37,779
because reading them made me

469
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:40,233
feel like you were still here with me.

470
00:19:40,258 --> 00:19:42,025
Oh, you're too sweet.

471
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:46,179
Unfortunately, we're
going to have to stick with

472
00:19:46,203 --> 00:19:47,971
my version of the events.

473
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:50,006
What? Why would we do that?

474
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,575
I don't want anyone
thinking I wrote these!

475
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,421
Well, I don't want
people thinking I'm reading

476
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:56,379
some other woman's love letters!

477
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:57,847
Well, it'll give you an edge.

478
00:19:57,881 --> 00:20:00,883
No one will ever accuse
you of being vanilla again.

479
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:05,184
Who's saying that?

480
00:20:10,068 --> 00:20:13,317
No kids, I understand that
you both have read

481
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:15,466
a somewhat adult-themed correspondence

482
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:17,607
between a loving wife and her husband?

483
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:20,380
Yeah, and I'd prefer if you
could stop talking about it.

484
00:20:20,414 --> 00:20:22,616
This is why I think it's
best to torch everything

485
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,638
from past failed relationships.

486
00:20:24,663 --> 00:20:27,554
I'd hardly call this a
failed relationship, David.

487
00:20:27,588 --> 00:20:30,357
We're still here, 35 years later.

488
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:32,560
Okay, here we go.

489
00:20:33,294 --> 00:20:34,685
I know you asked for a small,

490
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:37,118
but I "swapped it" for a large.

491
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:41,281
Twyla, may I say, you
are looking very chic.

492
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:43,547
Johnny: Would you look at
that? That looks like the tiara

493
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:46,006
you wore at your bat mitzvah, Alexis.

494
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,622
Well, I had a little
help from a friend.

495
00:20:48,876 --> 00:20:50,443
We should probably coordinate a time

496
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:51,645
to swap everything back.

497
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,193
Oh, don't worry, I'm fine.

498
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:58,380
And what exactly did you
get out of this fun swap?

499
00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:01,768
I got Twyla's step-brother's dog tags.

500
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:04,224
And a whistle. Moira: Caw! Caw!

501
00:21:04,258 --> 00:21:06,092
Oh!

502
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:09,136
Is she okay?

503
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,997
Yeah, she's just sleeping.

504
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:13,802
Well, I'm ready to order.

505
00:21:14,735 --> 00:21:16,974
Okay, can somebody close
her eyelids, at least?

506
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:19,267
Please?

507
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:24,291

1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:02,646
Look at the state of this place,

2
00:00:02,671 --> 00:00:04,892
it's like we're in a Mumbai-an slum.

3
00:00:04,926 --> 00:00:08,123
A year ago we had a staff of twenty-five

4
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:10,016
working the grounds of our home,

5
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,518
and now we walk by a mattress
on the side of the road,

6
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:14,653
without thinking twice about it.

7
00:00:14,688 --> 00:00:16,522
Well, the good news is
that mattress is covering up

8
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:18,924
- the cracked toilet seat.
- Oh, John.

9
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:21,461
John, do you remember
what Goldie Hawn told us

10
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:23,304
at that Amfar dinner?

11
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:24,687
I dunno.

12
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:27,300
"You are the life you accept for yourself."

13
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:28,882
Those are Goldie's words.

14
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,304
Or something someone said to her in India.

15
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:33,167
Or perhaps she read it.

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,459
In any case, it has always stayed with me.

17
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:38,439
John, I will not accept this life.

18
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:40,468
And neither should you!

19
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:41,916
Yeah.

20
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,541
I mean, would it kill someone
to plant a few peonies?!

21
00:00:44,913 --> 00:00:47,248
I have a feeling if
you want peonies, Moira,

22
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:49,315
you're gonna have to plant them yourself.

23
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:58,132
These are dark times
John, but not that dark.

24
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:06,866

25
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:14,250
I love how we can just
be silent with each other.

26
00:01:15,132 --> 00:01:17,410
Yeah.

27
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,404
I mean, I definitely feel
like we used to talk more

28
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:21,146
at the beginning,

29
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:24,148
but um, it's good that we
don't have to do that anymore.

30
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,226
Because now we can just express
how we feel through silence.

31
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,164
- What?
- Nothing.

32
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,390
What?

33
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:37,903
It's just, you're talking about
how nice it is not to talk,

34
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,298
but you're still, talking about it.

35
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:42,233
I mean, yeah, I'm not a mute!

36
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,281
Well, that is an understatement.

37
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:48,414
Are we having some
non-fight fight or something?

38
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:50,472
Because all I'm saying is
that it's nice to not talk,

39
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:52,467
but apparently I'm not
allowed to say that?!

40
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:54,112
No fight.

41
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:55,914
It's not a fight.

42
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:57,382
All I am saying is that you know,

43
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,716
you need to talk about everything,

44
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,390
and I... don't.

45
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:04,122
I don't need to talk about everything,

46
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:06,324
I'm just saying that, if I stopped talking,

47
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:08,585
then who knows when we're
gonna start talking again.

48
00:02:09,203 --> 00:02:10,961
You know?

49
00:02:21,914 --> 00:02:23,974
- That way.
- Thank you.

50
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:25,787
Are those my mannequins?

51
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,531
Yeah.

52
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:31,023
Well, where are they going?!

53
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:35,252
- Oh, I sold them on eBay.
- Well, what do you mean?

54
00:02:35,286 --> 00:02:37,726
But don't worry, I'm using the
money to buy other mannequins,

55
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:39,303
ones that are a little less um...

56
00:02:39,328 --> 00:02:41,257
- Fun?
- Porn-y.

57
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,125
Uh, I also placed a few other orders.

58
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,494
Little things to scatter around the store,

59
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:46,250
to give the space a more directional feel.

60
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:49,566
Oh David, I saw some
cute little knick-knacks

61
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,937
that I thought we could
pair with the scarves.

62
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:54,539
- Where are the scarves?
- Oh, I sold those, too.

63
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:58,540
Oh. Well, things are
happening very quickly.

64
00:02:58,575 --> 00:03:02,342
Now the candles, are they
something that we would sell

65
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:03,346
at a blouse store?

66
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,014
No, those are just decorative.

67
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:07,916
Scent is a really important
factor in defining a brand.

68
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:09,818
Alexander Wang once fired
my friend over the smell

69
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:11,460
of his cologne.

70
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:13,522
To Alex's credit, "Curve Pour Hommes"

71
00:03:13,556 --> 00:03:15,924
hasn't been the look since '97.

72
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,761
Well, the look and the smell
here's very "woody",

73
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:22,007
very funky.

74
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:26,434
Now David, you don't have
to sell all my things off.

75
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:28,336
You can use the company credit card.

76
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:30,071
Yeah, I used that, too.

77
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:32,773
Oh well then, save all the receipts,

78
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:36,007
because anything you buy
for the store is a write off.

79
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:38,346
The candles, and the jewelry stands...

80
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:39,812
No jewelry stands.

81
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:41,949
- No jewelry...
- Noooo!

82
00:03:41,974 --> 00:03:44,843
No, David! Jewelry stands!

83
00:03:44,868 --> 00:03:48,093
I have taken a moment
out of my busy schedule,

84
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:51,742
because this poor town
is sliding into disarray.

85
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,805
There is a filthy mattress just
lying on the side of the road

86
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,468
a few blocks from here!

87
00:03:56,493 --> 00:03:59,218
Oh no, that's Dick Sinson's
mattress, he's giving it away.

88
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:02,631
Ray, I have always seen you as a sensitive,

89
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:04,838
cultured, man of the world.

90
00:04:04,872 --> 00:04:07,648
- You have that striking accent.
- Thank you.

91
00:04:07,673 --> 00:04:10,411
And I'm sure your family
wanted more for you

92
00:04:10,445 --> 00:04:12,484
when they immigrated from...

93
00:04:13,114 --> 00:04:15,679
- Winnipeg.
- Winnipeg.

94
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:18,164
We deserve more, don't we, ray?

95
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:21,087
We deserve cleanliness,
we deserve flower beds,

96
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,226
we deserve better lives!

97
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:25,812
- You make some very good points Mrs. Rose.
- Thank you.

98
00:04:25,837 --> 00:04:28,601
But can I ask why are you
talking to me about this?

99
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:31,500
I'm hoping to take my complaint to council,

100
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:34,431
and I've been told you'd
be the easiest one to crack.

101
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:37,365
Too kind. And I'd be happy to help.

102
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,771
Excellent!

103
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:41,174
But unfortunately, I'm no
longer on the town council.

104
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,641
I resigned a few weeks ago,

105
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:44,960
too overwhelmed with my businesses.

106
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,712
But uh, you're more than welcome to take it

107
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:48,814
to council yourself, with my endorsement.

108
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:50,616
Which won't really help, since I resigned.

109
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,952
Um, and council wasn't too happy about it.

110
00:04:52,986 --> 00:04:54,640
I'm surprised you didn't hear,

111
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:57,022
I talked about it
extensively on my podcast.

112
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:58,554
I don't know how I missed that.

113
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,304
David, is that you?

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,953
- Huh?
- Hey!

115
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:11,615
Look at us, son, a couple of working stiffs

116
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,195
back from the salt mines.

117
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:16,382
- What?!
- Two men, back from the mines.

118
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:18,076
What mines? What's that mean?

119
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:19,444
It's a figure of speech.

120
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:22,179
Um, I don't get that.

121
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:24,875
The salt mines! Back
from when people mined.

122
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,752
- Uh huh...
- When miners worked in the, salt industry,

123
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,771
they'd come home, after digging... salt.

124
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,657
I don't know what it means!

125
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:34,959
Uh-huh, you know I just got
back from a four-hour shift

126
00:05:34,994 --> 00:05:38,578
that mostly consisted of me
sampling luxury candles so...

127
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,899
Well, that's
- that's a tough day.

128
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,934
Hmm.

129
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,740
Why don't you grab yourself a cold one?

130
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:47,438
You've earned it.

131
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,664
Working man.
- Thank you.

132
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:55,972
- There's nothing in here.
- Really?

133
00:05:55,997 --> 00:05:57,702
- Yeah.
- Oh, I must've taken the last one.

134
00:05:57,727 --> 00:05:59,195
Okay.

135
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:03,498
You know, for what it's worth, son,

136
00:06:03,523 --> 00:06:05,588
I just wanted to tell you uh...

137
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:08,312
- How proud of you I am.
- Thank you.

138
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:10,460
I mean, you got this job all on your own,

139
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:12,495
nobody had to make a
call, nobody got involved,

140
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,132
nobody had to... pay somebody off.

141
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:18,668
- What?
- And you're looking very, very sharp.

142
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:20,170
- Well...
- Is that a new sweater?

143
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:22,038
Uh, it is.

144
00:06:22,072 --> 00:06:23,540
Well, word to the wise, son,

145
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:26,429
don't... spend all your money at once.

146
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:28,367
- I thought you weren't getting involved.
- No, I'm not.

147
00:06:28,392 --> 00:06:31,085
I'm not, I'm just saying,
word to the wise, is all.

148
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,062
Okay, what does "word
to the wise" even mean?

149
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:36,374
Word to the wise.

150
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:40,189
When you're... speaking to somebody wise,

151
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:42,935
you lis... you're cognizant
of what they're saying.

152
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,804
A wise person telling you...

153
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:49,030
Anyway, just-just uh, keep
that in mind, and um...

154
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:52,197
Keep up the good work.

155
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,343
Thanks so much. I'm just
gonna use this now. So...

156
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:08,250
Wake up sleepy head, nap time's over.

157
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:13,722
Honestly, honestly, I have no money,

158
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:16,170
and an empty purse from two seasons ago!

159
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:17,289
Alexis, it's me.

160
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,810
Oh my God! Your face!

161
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:22,196
Yes, you can see it now!

162
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,016
You shaved!

163
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:28,936
Are you-are you crying?

164
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:30,889
No!

165
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:33,531
No, um, when did you do this?

166
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:35,195
Just now, I felt like a change.

167
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,612
And you didn't talk to me about it.

168
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:39,039
About me shaving my beard?

169
00:07:39,463 --> 00:07:41,568
- Yeah.
- Okay, what would we have talked about?

170
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:42,857
It's my face.

171
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:44,952
Um...

172
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,968
You'd have said, uh,

173
00:07:46,993 --> 00:07:52,281
"wow Alexis, I'm thinking
about shaving my beard."

174
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:53,992
And then I would've said,

175
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:57,773
"hm, no mutt, I don't think
that that's the right journey

176
00:07:57,798 --> 00:08:00,032
for you at this point in time."

177
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,368
Well, then I would've said, "too bad."

178
00:08:01,402 --> 00:08:03,179
I shave like, every six months.

179
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:05,109
Okay, you try growing a beard!

180
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:08,517
I was a beard for a very well known actor,

181
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:11,077
and I get it, it's uncomfortable.

182
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:13,507
But your beard is like, my
favorite thing about you!

183
00:08:13,781 --> 00:08:16,448
My beard is your favorite thing about me!

184
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:17,750
- I said one of my favorite things.
- No, no, no, no.

185
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:19,919
You said, "favorite thing!"

186
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:21,687
I just woke up, and you
have a different face.

187
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:24,190
So there's just a lot going on right now!

188
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:25,691
Yeah, tell me about it, I just found out

189
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:26,859
that my girlfriend's
favorite thing about me

190
00:08:26,894 --> 00:08:28,601
is the hair that grows out of my face!

191
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,062
I'm just saying...

192
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:33,732
That I think that that was a decision

193
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:36,067
that we needed to make as a couple.

194
00:08:36,102 --> 00:08:38,539
Okay? We need to communicate more.

195
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:42,623
I really didn't think
that "this" was a thing

196
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,875
we needed to talk about.

197
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,643
I thought we had a deeper thing goin' on.

198
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:47,179
That's not what this is about.

199
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:49,898
This is about me being
left out of the loop.

200
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:52,242
I do need to talk.

201
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:54,585
And maybe if we had talked more,

202
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,382
I could have prepared myself for this.

203
00:09:05,597 --> 00:09:07,465
Look at your little doll lips.

204
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,373
Thank you for installing the
ramp at the post office

205
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:16,726
But it's a little steep.

206
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:19,171
I've tried it twice, and both times,

207
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:21,187
I've been sort of shot back into traffic.

208
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:23,546
Yeah, but see the thing with a ramp is,

209
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:25,273
it's kind of a momentum thing,

210
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,731
you really gotta you know, give it a...

211
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:28,223
Attention please, council!

212
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:30,632
I have a concern.

213
00:09:30,824 --> 00:09:33,590
I was just hoping to be interrupted

214
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,500
by a concerned citizen.

215
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:37,914
Would you like to be
added to the agenda, Moira?

216
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:40,273
No need, I'm prepared to speak now.

217
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:41,718
Well, that just doesn't work, I mean,

218
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:43,664
we have a list, uh...

219
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:45,828
Bob, just concentrate on the minutes, okay?

220
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,148
I can tell right now you're behind.

221
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:50,316
Okay, typing is not my strong suit.

222
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,013
Ray could type without looking at the keys.

223
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:53,617
This will take but a moment.

224
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:56,510
I can't imagine you have anything
more pressing this afternoon.

225
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:59,593
Well, actually, Jennifer had the floor.

226
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:02,890
Hello.

227
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:05,781
You could've spoken up.

228
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,993
Excuse me.

229
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:11,757
David, if you're going out again,

230
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:13,850
can you pick up some new toilet paper?

231
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,257
I cannot use the stuff
the motel provides, okay?

232
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,783
It's like a birthday streamer.

233
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:19,776
You-you-it
stretches,

234
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:22,435
and then, and then you pull it,
and it just snaps, okay?

235
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,394
That-that whole thing
just fell off the roller!

236
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,487
Wow, um, dad, you remember Stevie.

237
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,803
Yes, yes, I remember Stevie.

238
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:34,125
I know Stevie. I knew Stevie was here.

239
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:36,920
That's why I came in
with something funny.

240
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:38,248
Hmm. Oh yeah, sure.

241
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:40,319
What's
this? Looks expensive.

242
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:42,210
Oh, this is some new bedding.

243
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:46,851
David, didn't I just...
Tell you to save your money?

244
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:48,187
Uh, yeah.

245
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:50,155
I am testing this out for the store,

246
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:51,750
so work is paying for it.

247
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:54,734
Work is paying for your bedding?

248
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,023
I was gonna leave, but now I don't want to.

249
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,023
What is that? Is that a new lamp?

250
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,012
Yeah, I'm thinking of bringing home-ware

251
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,820
into the store, so that's a write off.

252
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:08,872
- That's a write off?
- Yeah.

253
00:11:08,897 --> 00:11:10,966
Do you even know what a write off is?!

254
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:13,773
Uh yeah, it's when you buy
something for your business

255
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,382
and the government pays you back for it.

256
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:17,976
Oh, and who pays for it?

257
00:11:18,154 --> 00:11:20,601
Nobody, you write it off.

258
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:23,398
Who writes it off?!

259
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:25,822
I don't know, the govern...
The "write off" people!

260
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:27,789
Why are we having this conversation?

261
00:11:27,814 --> 00:11:30,148
So if I need booze
to get through my day,

262
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:33,042
- I can just write that off?
- That's a stretch.

263
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,068
But the skin care products
you got this morning,

264
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:36,085
those are a write off.

265
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,812
What skin care products? You
purchased skin care products?!

266
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:43,117
Okay, okay. I am the face of the company.

267
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:46,285
If I have acne, what does
that say about the legitimacy

268
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,570
of the store?

269
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:50,073
That's not a write off!

270
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:52,326
That's not a write off!

271
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:54,828
This?! Not a write off!

272
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,992
Oh, well, the bedding's non refundable, so.

273
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:02,507
David, a write off... is a business expense

274
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:05,687
used to reduce your taxable income!

275
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:09,808
Okay, well then why isn't
it called a "tax write off?"

276
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,265
It is!

277
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,962
It is, you can't just
buy things for yourself,

278
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:16,321
and write them off!

279
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,375
Well then, I'll return some things.

280
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:23,403
There's not enough space in here
for the massage chair, anyway.

281
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:25,533
I should get back to work.

282
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:27,820
Just in case any more
of your packages arrive.

283
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,625
I am here to address
an issue that I believe

284
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,968
Self-respect.

285
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:44,171
I don't think we can help
you in that department.

286
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,112
I'm speaking about what we have allowed

287
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,875
to happen to this town.

288
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,773
Everyone leaving their
old things here and there,

289
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:54,664
like some city-wide garage sale!

290
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:56,062
I deserve better!

291
00:12:57,545 --> 00:12:59,866
We deserve better.

292
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:04,086
A baby born in a prison cell does not know

293
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:06,430
that a toilet should
not be in the same room

294
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:07,960
as its bed, but we do.

295
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:10,186
I didn't know you'd been in prison.

296
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:13,304
What? No, I'm illustrating a point.

297
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,765
Okay, picture all of you living in a cave,

298
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,025
having never seen the outside world...

299
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,906
And then I show up.

300
00:13:22,156 --> 00:13:24,622
No, this is not what I'm trying to say.

301
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:26,085
What are you trying to say?

302
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,784
That we should strive for something

303
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,664
that sets us apart from the prison baby.

304
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:33,203
Greenery! We need greenery!

305
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:35,718
Flowers, Boxwood trees!

306
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:39,852
Two sets each for the cafe, and the motel.

307
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,754
And then a citywide clean up,

308
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,956
and I will not take no for an answer.

309
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:52,390
Yeah well, I was actually
just gonna suggest that.

310
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,257
Before you suggested it.

311
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,359
Thank you.

312
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:58,948
So there was just one baby in prison,

313
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:00,757
or there were more?

314
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:07,398
- Did you lose weight?
- I shaved my beard.

315
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:11,617
Oh, I like it. You look younger.

316
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,110
Thank you, Twyla. That means a lot.

317
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:16,034
So, what can I get you guys?

318
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:18,976
Um, what's the cake today?

319
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:21,103
I'm sorry, did you just ask for cake?

320
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,937
I'm not used to you ordering solid food.

321
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:24,914
Yeah, I'll just have a slice of whatever.

322
00:14:28,882 --> 00:14:30,408
I guess I'm having cake.

323
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:34,929
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

324
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:44,348
I don't know, I just feel
like something's changed...

325
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,383
with us.

326
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,217
Huh.

327
00:14:50,985 --> 00:14:52,486
What are you thinking?

328
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,414
I don't know if anything's changed.

329
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:58,906
I think maybe we know
each other better now.

330
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,851
Maybe that's the problem.

331
00:15:01,222 --> 00:15:03,490
No, no, I'm not saying
that there's a problem,

332
00:15:03,515 --> 00:15:05,757
I'm just saying that there
are definitely a few things

333
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:08,437
between us that need to be adjusted

334
00:15:08,462 --> 00:15:10,882
in order to make this work for us.

335
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:15,302
Like maybe I need to
talk less and listen more,

336
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:19,437
and you need to talk more, and listen less.

337
00:15:22,577 --> 00:15:24,745
And are you willing to
make these adjustments?

338
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,658
Well...

339
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:31,023
Are you?

340
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,787
- Uh...
- I brought two forks.

341
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:35,578
Just in case you wanted to share.

342
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:45,708
S...

343
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Hmm.

344
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,142
Yeah.

345
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,550
Be careful on those stairs!

346
00:16:38,585 --> 00:16:41,545
Hey, next order of business,
we install a ramp here.

347
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,354
- Hey!
- Hmm?

348
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:45,656
You really put Roland on the spot there.

349
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:48,193
I was simply exercising
a basic human right.

350
00:16:48,227 --> 00:16:50,261
Yeah, and I don't disagree with you.

351
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:52,225
I've always known you were on my side.

352
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,766
I wouldn't go that far.
But I will say this,

353
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,836
usually these council
decisions, they take weeks.

354
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,370
Oh, I won't wait for anyone's decision.

355
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:01,672
I once got Winnie Mandela to RSVP

356
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:04,875
to an "Artists Against Eczema"
benefit within the hour.

357
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:09,087
You're a pain in the ass,
but you get stuff done.

358
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,525
- A delightful compliment.
- Hmm, but those boxwood trees?

359
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,317
Oh yes, two sets,

360
00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:15,085
and if you know a good ceramicist...

361
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,654
I would lower your expectations.

362
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:20,190
You're lucky if you get
some daisies in a planter.

363
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:23,737
But good work.
- Thank you.

364
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,495
Eczema benefit?

365
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:28,065
Yes, you try enjoying a puff pastry

366
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,500
with everyone around you scratching.

367
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:32,802
Ew!

368
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:39,253
Ugh!

369
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:52,088
What's going on?

370
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,328
I think Mutt and I ended things.

371
00:17:55,018 --> 00:17:57,452
You think? Okay, here's a serious question:

372
00:17:57,637 --> 00:18:00,312
Are you capable of making
an executive decision?

373
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:03,566
It's done.

374
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:09,148
Um... what happened?

375
00:18:09,773 --> 00:18:12,804
I don't know, like, we were
talking, and then we just...

376
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:15,974
Like, didn't talk for a long time.

377
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:20,718
Okay. And that's it?

378
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,812
No, and then we talked
about why we weren't talking.

379
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:28,829
And then we both agreed that
even though the sex was amazing...

380
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:30,455
- Mhmm.
- Like, amazing!

381
00:18:32,132 --> 00:18:36,443
There was this time in the barn
where I climbed up onto this rafter...

382
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:39,521
But yeah, no, I think-I think we're good.

383
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:42,503
Yeah, anyway, we both
agreed that we'd just been

384
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,023
lusting after each other
for such a long time

385
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:48,296
that that's what we were holding onto,

386
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,351
and not what was right in front of us.

387
00:18:52,113 --> 00:18:54,578
- Which was what?
- What?

388
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:56,570
What was right in front of you?

389
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:59,220
- When?
- Okay.

390
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:01,717
Okay. So anyway, it's done.

391
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:03,891
And it's just really weird,

392
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:06,293
because I've never felt
anything after a break up.

393
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:07,995
- Mhmm.
- Like, nothing.

394
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:09,763
Like, I've been to doctors about it.

395
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:12,232
- Mhmm...
- But this time, it's different.

396
00:19:12,624 --> 00:19:14,092
Well, that's good.

397
00:19:16,585 --> 00:19:18,132
I think he changed me a bit.

398
00:19:20,187 --> 00:19:21,679
Like he knows me.

399
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:26,469
I let him know me. You know?

400
00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:32,945
I think I need a hug, or something.

401
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:36,155
W-you what?

402
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:37,933
I need a hug.

403
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,054
Uh... uh...

404
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,062
- David, will you please give me a hug?
- Oh, okay, yes, yeah.

405
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:55,036
Did you get new bedding?

406
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:57,289
Um, yeah, I did.

407
00:19:58,203 --> 00:19:59,737
But it's a write off, so I don't...

408
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:01,329
Anyway.

409
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,707
David, Alexis!

410
00:20:09,404 --> 00:20:11,404
Could you come out here, please?

411
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,122
David, Alexis!

412
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:20,739
Come see this!
- What?

413
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,591
Honestly, John, it's not worth it.

414
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:27,474
Your mother has done something
we can all be proud of.

415
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,167
Oh, did you pick up that random condom

416
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:30,831
that was on the grass there?

417
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,264
- Ew yeah, whose was that?
- I have no idea.

418
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,027
No, that's not it. Not it.

419
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:35,255
They'll never see it.

420
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,825
Throw it on the long
list of things I've done

421
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,718
for my children they don't appreciate.

422
00:20:38,743 --> 00:20:42,044
Your mother had these boxwoods put in.

423
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:47,519
- Weren't those here before?
- There was literally nothing here.

424
00:20:47,544 --> 00:20:48,913
It was a wasteland.

425
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,208
Weren't there more plants here before?

426
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:53,360
No, there weren't! And
there are more around town.

427
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,246
Thanks to your mother.

428
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:57,630
That's great.

429
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:01,278
Okay.

430
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:04,557
- Are we good with the plants, or?
- Can we go? Yeah.

431
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:05,949
- Yeah, we're good.
- Okay.

432
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,397
Oh, there's the condom right there, David.

433
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:11,567
Ew! Eww!

434

435
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,587
There seems to be a rumor

436
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,599
going around about me.

437
00:21:20,624 --> 00:21:21,690
I heard that one.

438
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:22,742
It's only because you converse

439
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:23,698
with women easily

440
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:25,281
and you dress so well.

441
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:27,016
I wouldn't give it
another thought.

442
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:28,884
- What?
- I'm sorry, which rumor

443
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:31,544
are you talking about?

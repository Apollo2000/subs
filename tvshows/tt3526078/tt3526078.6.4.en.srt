the first trailer
to the "Crows" movie!

- My "Crows" movie?

This is a critical moment.

We're going to watch
the "Crows" trailer.

No! No, go away.

for an earring

Anyway, you did it.

You weren't supposed to be here
for six months,

someone else.

of money and a gun.

Should we give it
another watch?

No, I think three times

I gotta say,
those special effects looked

way better than what I pictured

You seem to be wishing
to discharge something

from your chest today
at rehearsal

- You're fine.

Why?
Why do you hate my movie?

- I just saw the trailer.
- Exactly!

I just don't like horror
movies.

My first boyfriend took me
to a Michael Meyers movie

- Oh, bow.
- No bow.

309
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:38,808
I sort of feel like bow tie
is kind of classic, no?

Okay, you sort of made it
seem like you weren't sure.

311
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,339
I'm not sure.
But I also very much am.

312
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:46,971
Also, a black bow ties
photograph better.

313
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,297
I should know.

with three different
GQ Men of the Year.

315
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,647
At the GQ Men of the Year party.

316
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:52,824
Okay, sorry.

317
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:55,716
I'm probably not the person
to ask for fashion stuff.

318
00:12:56,015 --> 00:12:57,862
Um, speaking of maid of
honour duties...

319
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,625
Stevie? Thoughts on
the bachelor party.

320
00:13:00,856 --> 00:13:01,944
Oh-oh.

321
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:06,742
Um, I think I was just gonna
see what David wanted to do?

322
00:13:07,173 --> 00:13:08,808
Okay. I'm super easy.

323
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:11,351
Although I did find a gorgeous
ryokan in Hakone

324
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:13,678
With a hot spring-fed onsen
on the balcony?

325
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:15,117
Private Chef optional.

326
00:13:15,205 --> 00:13:16,708
But I'm open to other ideas.

327
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:19,490
Okay. Hot tip: it often makes
for less stress

328
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:21,840
if you just plan it yourself
and then tell the bride after.

329
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,636
Okay. Stevie,
not hot on that tip. Okay?

330
00:13:24,724 --> 00:13:26,415
Okay, I'm starting to realize

331
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:29,164
that there's a lot more to this
job than I thought.

332
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:30,303
Tell me about it.

333
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:32,335
I once planned
Megan Fox's bachelorette

334
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:34,827
on this tiny island off
the coast of Montenegro

335
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,881
where nothing is illegal.
Like nothing.

336
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:42,227
Okay. Are you sure you
shouldn't do this?

337
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:43,585
Because, I mean...

338
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:45,768
you're here now,
you're David's sister,

339
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:48,218
and you're clearly better
suited for the job.

340
00:13:48,732 --> 00:13:50,234
Oh my God, Stevie.

341
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:53,055
I get why you and everyone else
would be asking that question,

342
00:13:53,143 --> 00:13:55,479
but the answer is...

343
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,909
like maybe?

344
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,071
What am I doing?

345
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,328
Well, we can just crossfade
responsibilities.

346
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,918
No. What am I doing
with my life.

347
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:10,788
I'm now unemployed
in my thirties.

348
00:14:11,082 --> 00:14:13,085
For the second time in a week.

349
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:15,483
I left your dad high
and dry at the motel...

350
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:16,921
and now I'm...

[Stressed exhale]

352
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:24,555
Okay, all of what you're
saying may be very, very true.

353
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:29,521
Which is why I will not
let you give up this job.

354
00:14:29,609 --> 00:14:32,011
You can do this.
And if you can't,

355
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:34,380
I will be here for the whole
month to help you through it.

Bring it in, girl.

Oh my God.

361
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:47,446
Since when did James Bond
shop to Elm Glenn?

362
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,448
- So that's a yes?
- Yes.

363
00:14:49,594 --> 00:14:52,236
Um, we still need to pick
a tie.

364
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:56,391
So what does our maid
of honour think?

365
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:01,803
Hm. Hm.

366
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:03,661
Which one is your favourite.

367
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,565
Hm...

368

Yes.

369

Can we just get married
already?

370
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:14,309
I'm kidding,
I want pageantry

371
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:16,159
that takes months
and months to plan.

- You look so good.

Okay.

Oh, I really don't know
about this, Roland.

Still feels like a police
matter to me.

Johnny, you got this.
Relax.

Remember there is two of us,
one of him so.

Okay.

Of course he does have
that gun.

Yeah?

384
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:44,553
Hi.
My name is Johnny Rose...

385
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:49,718
and this is my partner...

He calls me...
No we actually just met.

00:15:55,112 --> 00:15:56,646
What're you, guys, cops?

[Laughs nervously]
No. No, no.

390
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:00,260
No weapons here.

00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:02,009
No, we're um,

392
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:03,844
we're the new owners
of this motel

393
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:05,807
and we just stopped by
and say hi,

394
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:07,331
and to get a little more
information

395
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:10,343
about what exactly you are
doing here on our property.

396
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:14,848
And by the way, whatever
you're doing is A-okay with me.

397
00:16:14,936 --> 00:16:18,198
But unfortunately
Professor Prude here

398
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:19,679
is not too keen on
"squatters."

399
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:21,531
Who said I'm a squatter?

400
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,881
I'm a long-term tenant.

401
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:24,849
Betty told me she'd bake
that into the contract.

402
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,236
Bake it into the contract.
Roland?

403
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:30,454
Was it in the contract?

404
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:32,970
The contract is like
25 pages.

405
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,687
That's what lawyers are for.
Well, I'm a lawyer.

406
00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:37,776
And I assure you that
it's in there.

407
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,494
You're a lawyer?

408
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:42,909
Then might I ask
what you're doing here?

409
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:44,332
I'm a prosecutor.

410
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,222
And uh, when you're putting
away the kind of guys I do...

411
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,137
- Or gals.
- No, never women.

412
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:52,047
It's always safest
to keep a low profile.

413
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:54,834
So part of that involved
paying Betty and Benny in cash.

[Relieved exhales]
Okay.

Well, that explains what
that big ole bag was for.

416
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:03,410
How do you know
I have a big old bag?

417
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:04,639
I didn't know.

418
00:17:04,727 --> 00:17:06,891
I don't know anything
about a bag.

419

You guys have been in my
room, haven't you?

420

We wouldn't want you
to have to use your gun.

he's talking about.

cash payments

I think my reason

for not wanting to jump
on the bandwagon

453
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:31,667
is just that I've seen you
get your hopes up before,

when things didn't work out.

- I did.

472
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:24,259
You? You did.

473
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:28,923
Oh, wow... Jocelyn, thank you.

474
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:32,835
Nothing about me
or my performance?

475
00:19:33,064 --> 00:19:35,371
Oh. It's just a first draft.

476
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:36,821
Yes. Okay.

477
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,130
- I really liked your feathers!
- Mhmm.

478
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:40,262
They're very life-like.

479
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,096
Surprise. They are real.

480
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:45,498
1200 of them hand-sewn
into my costume.

481
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:46,588
Mhmm.

482
00:19:46,676 --> 00:19:49,113
The live crows on set
welcomed me as their own.

483
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:50,837
One even tried to mate.

484
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:54,407
- Ooh. Sounds dangerous.
- [Chuckles] Wow.

485
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:58,121
Perhaps one more watch to get
your superlatives surging anew?

486
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:00,491
Oh Moira, I'm sure
that you're tired and...

487
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:01,578
okay.

488
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:02,882
Trailer Voice: <i>"There was
a time</i>

489
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,691
<i>when the Crows were our
friends."</i>

490
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:06,651
- That voice really is creepy.
- Shh.

491
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:14,009
Wow, so what happened?

492
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:16,265
She was ready to hand over
the crown.

493
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:17,862
Oh, she was, but...

494
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,681
I feel like she needs it
more than I do.

495
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,453
Wow. Who are you?

496
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,836
I know, right?
Like what's happening to me?

497
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:25,441
- You're going soft.
- Ugh.

498
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:27,588
But don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.

499
00:20:27,777 --> 00:20:29,342
Anyway, it might kill
me on the day,

500
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,916
but I'm glad that she actually
found something

501
00:20:31,003 --> 00:20:33,338
- to distract herself.
- Hm. Mhmm.

502
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:36,199
Speaking of the day...

503
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:37,831
I have a better job for you?

504
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,727
Okay. I think it would be
a weird look for me

505
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:41,682
to be a flower girl
at my age, David.

506
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:43,620
I've thought about it...

507
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:46,250
and I want you
to give me away.

508
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,593
Oh my God, David.

509
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,288
That's like arguably the most
important role of the wedding.

510
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:55,624
A simple yes or no is fine.
No need to pull focus.

511
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,802
Okay.
I do.

512
00:20:58,556 --> 00:20:59,570
Great.

513
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,672
Although now that I think
about it,

514
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,736
I could also be the flower girl.

515
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:06,695
Like come out first, wearing a
gown made entirely of flowers...

516
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:08,432
- No.
- Just walk down the aisle,

517
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,070
- and loop back...
- Absolutely not.

518
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:11,999
And then quick outfit change,
and we're up.

519
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:14,318
I take it back,
I'm gonna ask Jocelyn.

520
00:21:15,794 --> 00:21:19,475
- Hm. Hey...
- Enough.

521
00:21:20,093 --> 00:21:22,518

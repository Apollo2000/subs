1
00:00:02,217 --> 00:00:04,082
David! Alexis!

2
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:05,951
Time to leave for breakfast.

3
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:08,789
Honestly David, why are you not ready?

4
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:10,391
I'm not going.

5
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:11,959
How is it that a moth can find its way

6
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:14,028
into a triple locked titanium suitcase?!

7
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:15,863
The perils of owning cashmere.

8
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:18,332
Alexis! Please, dear!

9
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:19,600
Alexis hasn't been here
for a week and a half.

10
00:00:19,634 --> 00:00:21,001
She's at Mutt's.

11
00:00:21,036 --> 00:00:22,770
Well, that's simply not true.

12
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:24,805
I had breakfast with her just yesterday.

13
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,506
That was me!

14
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:30,292
We had a lengthy conversation
about hosiery and menopause.

15
00:00:30,317 --> 00:00:31,884
Again, that was me.

16
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:38,310
-- Synced by the_foe --
-- (for KochAsia) --

17
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:43,657
Hello? Anyone here?

18
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:45,626
Oh, hey.

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,229
Could I get you to take a
quick look at my muffler?

20
00:00:48,263 --> 00:00:50,514
Oh, I'm - I'm sorry, I don't work here.

21
00:00:50,748 --> 00:00:53,067
Oh, that's... 'cause you're
behind the desk,

22
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:54,668
and everything.

23
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:56,637
Oh yeah, no, I mean I "work" here,

24
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,287
but I don't actually work
"here... " in the garage.

25
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:04,184
I mean, I am working, here in the garage,

26
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,717
but I don't work for the garage. I'm...

27
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,368
So you don't know
anything about mufflers?

28
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:12,461
'cause I think it's just a
loose connection on the bottom.

29
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:14,698
Yeah, Bob will be back in a minute,

30
00:01:14,723 --> 00:01:16,490
and I think that's your best bet,

31
00:01:16,524 --> 00:01:18,928
Just you know, 'cause
he comes and goes, and...

32
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:25,661
Okay, well, maybe I'll
just... go to another garage.

33
00:01:25,828 --> 00:01:29,521
Yeah, yeah. Well,
sorry, I uh, couldn't help.

34
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,289
Hey Johnny, I just went
out and got me a muffin.

35
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,945
Bob, a customer was just in here,

36
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,701
and he was saying he had
a problem with a muffler.

37
00:01:44,726 --> 00:01:47,127
Oh yeah? What uh,
what'd it end up being?

38
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:49,678
Well, I don't know, I
didn't go out and look!

39
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:52,020
- Oh?
- I'm not a mechanic!

40
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:54,434
Well, I don't expect
you to know everything,

41
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,027
but you know, if a client
of yours came in here,

42
00:01:56,052 --> 00:01:57,853
I'd certainly talk to them.

43
00:01:58,068 --> 00:02:00,834
Well, I hope you wouldn't.

44
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:01,835
Well, not that I have to worry,

45
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,381
I know you're a little low on clients.

46
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:08,285
That's because I'm
building a business, Bob.

47
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,311
And right now I'm in strategy mode,

48
00:02:10,345 --> 00:02:12,046
looking for opportunities,

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,049
and eventually I will implement a plan.

50
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,318
Well, if you feel like uh,

51
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:19,334
you might like to implement
a muffler, be my guest.

52
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:22,561
Because I can't afford to lose
any customers right now, Johnny,

53
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:26,209
Especially ah, when I'm
giving away free office space.

54
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:39,639
Question.

55
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,119
The cedar planks out behind the motel,

56
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:44,511
are they being used for something,

57
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:46,225
or are they up for grabs?

58
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,918
How do you know it's cedar?

59
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:50,417
Um, I bought a cologne once, in Japan,

60
00:02:50,452 --> 00:02:51,685
that's supposed to smell like the aftermath

61
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,693
of a car crashing into a cedar tree.

62
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,653
Why would anyone wanna smell like that?

63
00:02:56,024 --> 00:02:57,524
- Hmm?
- You know what?

64
00:02:57,559 --> 00:03:00,461
Never mind, the cedar is yours.

65
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:01,462
Thank you so much.

66
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:03,646
Um, If I may,

67
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,586
what are you planning on
doing with a pile of wood?

68
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:10,058
Oh. Um...

69
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,318
A family of moths seem to have mistaken

70
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:13,644
my cashmere sweaters for an Atlantic City

71
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,670
all-you-can-eat
buffet.

72
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,295
And I plan on putting a stop to that.

73
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,303
So I'm building a cedar chest for my knits.

74
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:23,351
You're planning on
building a cedar chest?

75
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:25,310
That's correct.

76
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:26,506
You are.

77
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:29,990
- You're gonna build it?
- It's a box!

78
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:32,131
So you're just nailing some
planks of wood together.

79
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:34,068
Anyway, if you've seen
the state of my sweaters,

80
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:36,761
you'd know that I have very
little choice in the matter.

81
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,499
- So thank you.
- Okay well, don't let me

82
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:40,131
stand in the way of your handiwork!

83
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:42,736
- Mhmm.
- May the force be with you.

84
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:44,638
Thank you so much.

85
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:46,440
Thank you, genuinely.

86
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:48,475
Honestly, you're so great.

87
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:58,152
Oh, Twyla...

88
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,412
Twyla!

89
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,857
Twyla!

90
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:07,329
Uh, be right there, Mrs. Rose.

91
00:04:07,354 --> 00:04:09,239
- Hi, Moira!
- Hello, everyone.

92
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:11,037
Hey.

93
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:12,615
- I'll see you guys later.
- Yeah, see you at two.

94
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,607
Yeah.

95
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:16,825
Sorry about that, I wasn’t
sure whether you were waiting

96
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,075
for your family, or a friend...

97
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,168
No, just an intimate
breakfast, nothing special,

98
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:23,995
no big "ladies' bruncheon" for me.

99
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,451
Ladies' bruncheon?

100
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,685
Well, whatever that was.
A gathering of the girls, I...

101
00:04:28,745 --> 00:04:31,147
- Oh, you mean the Jazzagals.
- I do?

102
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:33,106
Yeah, the Jazzagals
is our singing group.

103
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:35,665
A singing group? What fun.

104
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,707
Yeah, Jocelyn started
it a few years ago,

105
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:39,335
and it's been great.

106
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,021
We even went to New York once.

107
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:43,631
Oh, a trip to the big city. How grand!

108
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:46,250
Let me guess, a bucket
of shrimp in Times Square,

109
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:48,676
followed by a "Lion King" matinee!

110
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:51,670
No, actually, we
performed in Central Park.

111
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:53,693
C-Central Park? Really?

112
00:04:53,718 --> 00:04:56,912
Yeah! For the "Little
Towns, Big Voices" Festival.

113
00:04:57,935 --> 00:05:00,570
You do realize I am
a professional vocalist.

114
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:01,920
Oh, really?

115
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:03,947
I thought you were in like, a soap opera.

116
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:06,428
Oh, I didn't know you
were a fan, thank you!

117
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:08,912
My roots are in the theater.

118
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:11,739
Especially musicals.
Anything "Andy" Webber!

119
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:14,076
Wow! So did you record an album?

120
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:17,170
Oh, yes, you'll find
me on ensemble tracks

121
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:21,264
seven, nine, and thirteen of the
original cast recording of Starlight...

122
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,529
"Starlight Express."

123
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:26,185
Well, then you should
definitely talk to Jocelyn!

124
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,178
She would love to have you in the group.

125
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,205
Or perhaps Jocelyn should speak to me.

126
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,584
Yeah. Menu?

127
00:05:33,786 --> 00:05:36,725
Yes please, I'm still
not quite off book.

128
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:42,514
Aaah!

129
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:44,982
Uh huh?

130
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:48,037
Uh, hey, I just came by for Alexis,

131
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:49,982
she wanted me to grab some uh...

132
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,873
- Cute looks for...
- Cute looks for the barn?

133
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:53,865
- Yeah.
- Yeah, in the closet.

134
00:05:54,802 --> 00:05:56,270
Everything okay?

135
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:57,896
Yeah, I'm just um...

136
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:00,240
I'm just doing some measurements,
I'm measuring something, so.

137
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:01,787
- Why don't you use a measuring tape?

138
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:03,685
- Ah, because we don't have one.

139
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,873
- Did you ask Stevie if
maybe the motel has one?

140
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,825
- Um... yeah, I haven't got...

141
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,678
I hadn't thought of...
I didn't think of that.

142
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:13,867
- So what are you measuring, exactly?
- Um...

143
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:15,731
It's a really tragic story,

144
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:18,303
involving some damaged luxury cashmere.

145
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:22,857
And so I am building a
cedar chest for my sweaters.

146
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:27,146
So I'm just measuring
how big to make the chest.

147
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:28,471
- Well, I've built a chest before.
- Yeah?

148
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:30,463
And I have some time, um...

149
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:32,342
Do you want some help?

150
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,295
You know what? That could be good.

151
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,920
Well, how far along are you?

152
00:06:36,945 --> 00:06:39,459
Um, I'm this far.

153
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:50,507
I can't come in, But
I do have some good news.

154
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:52,320
That's great.

155
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:55,038
What's your news?

156
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:57,898
Well, a little bird chirped in my ear

157
00:06:57,932 --> 00:06:59,249
about your singing group.

158
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,405
Oh, you mean the Jazzagals.

159
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,065
Yes, at first I wondered aloud

160
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,492
why would a competitive vocal group

161
00:07:06,517 --> 00:07:09,252
not reach out to a trained chanteuse?

162
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:10,911
Oh, we're just a group of gals.

163
00:07:10,936 --> 00:07:13,062
Exactly, that's the answer.

164
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,901
Small minds don't reach for the stars.

165
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:18,782
No more! Not on my watch.

166
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:21,226
Jocelyn, I am here!

167
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,461
You wanna audition for the Jazzagals?

168
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:27,655
Au-Audition!

169
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,348
Uh, though I'm sure you mean no offense,

170
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:32,426
in the actual world of entertainment,

171
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,734
I'm what's known as, "offer only."

172
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:38,610
Moira, I know you're a great singer,

173
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:40,421
everybody has to audition,

174
00:07:40,446 --> 00:07:42,680
and I can't have you not audition,

175
00:07:42,705 --> 00:07:44,171
it would open up a whole can of worms,

176
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:47,155
I mean, even Gwen had to audition,

177
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,916
and she was in a regional
production of "Annie."

178
00:07:51,126 --> 00:07:52,484
Who hasn't been?

179
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:56,564
Listen, we would love to have you,

180
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:58,265
you think about it.

181
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:01,575
Okay...

182
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:13,288
Bob? You've got a customer!

183
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,803
Bob!

184
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:29,187
Yeah, the owner's just
stepped out, uh, but,

185
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:32,559
maybe... I can help you?

186
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,101
Hey.

187
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:44,359
Has Paul Bunion finished his box?

188
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,827
Who?

189
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:51,732
I'm going to need some
things for the chest.

190
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:53,695
Like the number for a carpenter?

191
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:56,259
Like, a work bench, a miter saw,

192
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:57,937
two bar clamps, and some dowels.

193
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:02,153
Okay... do you know
how to use a miter saw?

194
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:04,511
Um, no. Mutt is out back,

195
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:07,460
and he's asked me to
get these things for him.

196
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:11,835
Um, we're building the
chest together. So...

197
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:17,712
Wow, this whole thing
just got a lot weirder.

198
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:22,006
There's a tool shed out back,
the other side of the motel.

199
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:25,820
- Okay.
- Will you be requiring a tool box?

200
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,507
Maybe?

201
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:32,077
Um, let's go with yes, just to be safe.

202
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:34,237
Will you be needing your basic toolbox,

203
00:09:34,262 --> 00:09:37,413
or your "cedar chest" tool box?

204
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,796
Obviously the cedar chest tool box!

205
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:43,169
Oh, that's in the shed.

206
00:09:43,197 --> 00:09:45,210
It's a big wooden box,

207
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:48,327
with the words, "tools
to make a cedar chest"

208
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:50,834
carved into the side of
it, so it's really clear...

209
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:52,804
Okay, I'm assuming you're kidding.

210
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:54,234
Um...

211
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:56,425
But in the off chance that you're not,

212
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,554
where in the shed would I find that box?

213
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:02,366
You're kidding.

225
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,497
- Hi!
- Sorry for interrupting.

226
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:41,232
I just-I just thought I'd stop by,

227
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:42,551
I was in the neighbourhood.

228
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,768
Maybe I should showcase my talents,

229
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:45,670
I thought, for the group.

230
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:47,827
Oh, that's great.

231
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:49,432
Great, you can call it
an audition if you must,

232
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:52,365
or an impromptu performance,

233
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,695
or perhaps "An Evening with... "

234
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:56,981
That all sounds amazing.

235
00:10:57,016 --> 00:11:00,018
We're just finishing up a rehearsal,

236
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:02,620
we just have to work out a couple
of rough spots in Lena's solo,

237
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:04,960
and then you can have the floor.

238
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:06,834
I'll wait, far be it
for me to get in the way

239
00:11:06,859 --> 00:11:09,820
of you making any necessary improvements.

240
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:13,731
Okay, so we're almost there,

241
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:14,966
let's just work out some
of those little rough spots.

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,968
- Okay?
- Okay.

243
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:18,870
So let's take it from...

244
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:19,938
"For tonight, for the first time."

245
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,306

Hey, Johnny. Keepin' busy,
or uh... hardly workin'?

250
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,568
Well, first of all Bob,
that's not the expression.

251
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:46,331
Um, take a seat.

252
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:53,091
If I may, an observation?

253
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:57,419
To run a business, you have to be here

254
00:11:57,661 --> 00:11:58,958
to run the business.

255
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,904
You have to be here to
deal with your clients.

256
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:06,021
That's what I've been doing all afternoon.

257
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:08,113
You got some clients, that's great news!

258
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:13,200
No, I was dealing with your customers!

259
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:14,826
Well, thank you, Johnny,

260
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,195
That's a refreshing change of attitude.

261
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:18,771
Bob, you're never here!

262
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:21,099
And while you were gone,

263
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:23,833
I helped a customer fill his tire with air,

264
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:27,261
I helped an elderly
woman add oil to her car,

265
00:12:27,286 --> 00:12:30,822
and I sold the '93 Buick for $350 dollars.

266
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:33,411
You've got to be here to run your business!

267
00:12:33,446 --> 00:12:35,713
Whoa, you have been busy!

268
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,622
Listen, uh...

269
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:41,216
tell me just a little more
about selling that Buick.

270
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:45,529
Well, it's a funny story.

271
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:48,249
This guy came in supposedly for directions.

272
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:50,404
Okay, but anyone with a background in sales

273
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:52,230
could see how he was eyeballing that Buick.

274
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:54,065
So I slow play it.

275
00:12:54,497 --> 00:12:56,286
I pretend I don't notice.

276
00:12:56,637 --> 00:12:59,572
And then he sort of mentions the Buick.

277
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:02,599
So I hem and haw, textbook
stuff, I tell him, you know,

278
00:13:02,624 --> 00:13:05,092
oh, there's a lot of interest
in that particular vehicle.

279
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:07,685
You know, I'm playing
the guy like a bow fiddle.

280
00:13:08,226 --> 00:13:10,494
Then he finally admits
this is the kind of car

281
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,326
that he's been looking for.

282
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:14,319
Oh, really? Says I.

283
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:16,028
That's when I go in for the kill.

284
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:21,553
Long story short, he forks
over $350 dollars cash.

285
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:23,488
And you're welcome.

286
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:27,131
Certain instincts you just don't lose.

287
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,591
It's like riding a bike.

288
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:31,997
Well, funny you should
use that expression.

289
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:36,307
Because Dick Sinson is
gonna be riding his bike

290
00:13:36,342 --> 00:13:39,201
until we can get his car back for him!

291
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,911
- Who's Dick Simpson?
- I couldn't tell 'ya.

292
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:45,404
But Dick Sinson is the fella
whose car you just sold.

293
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:47,483
He brought it in for a brake job.

294
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:49,629
I don't recall him wanting to sell it.

295
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:50,592
Oh.

296
00:13:50,904 --> 00:13:52,557
Oh, poor Dick.

297
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:54,310
He loved that car.

298
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,358
It was a gift from the church.

299
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,959
He and his family hit on
some hard times, and uh...

300
00:13:59,984 --> 00:14:01,475
Yeah, you know what, Bob?

301
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,803
I'll tell 'ya, I will call
Mr. Stinson, and apologize.

302
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:07,839
Well, you can apologize to Mr. Stinson

303
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:09,701
until the cows come home,

304
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:13,954
but I don't see how that
is gonna help Dick Sinson!

305
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,709
I'll fix it, Bob!

306
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:18,248
Here's hopin'.

307
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:24,088
Ridiculous name!

308
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,483
Sin-Sinson... Sinson!

309
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:28,451
Dick Sin-Sinson!

310
00:14:33,113 --> 00:14:35,781
Ahh... we just need
to wait for the glue to dry,

311
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:38,236
- it shouldn't take too long.
- This is really nice of you.

312
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,397
Thank you very much.

313
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,850
Yeah, well, I can't not jump in and help

314
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,889
when I see someone doin' something wrong.

315
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,455
Was it wrong, or was
it just unconventional?

316
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,139
No, it was wrong.

317
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,483
Okay, well, I'm not
gonna argue with you,

318
00:14:51,508 --> 00:14:53,542
'cause I need you to keep
working, we're in too deep.

319
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:57,155
Uh, does Alexis know about this?

320
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:59,279
Yeah... definitely.

321
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:06,561
But can I tell you something?

322
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,279
But you gotta promise not to tell Alexis.

323
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:13,022
Okay, um...

324
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,240
If you're experiencing feelings for me,

325
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:18,409
Like, I totally get it.

326
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:19,877
And normally I'd be into it,

327
00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:21,212
I've just been down this road before,

328
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:23,247
and it's-it's messy.

329
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:25,904
- No, it's about Alexis.
- I see, okay.

330
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,367
Um, well, you know, uh...

331
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:31,381
what is it?

332
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:32,991
She slept over like
a week and a half ago,

333
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:34,568
and she hasn't left.

334
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,961
- Uh huh.
- I mean, don't get me wrong,

335
00:15:36,996 --> 00:15:38,396
I love having her there at night,

336
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,920
- if you know what I mean.
- Yeah, I do, yeah.

337
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:43,397
It's just the days,
they've gotten a bit um...

338
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:44,826
Suffocating?

339
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:49,625
I just think that a little
space is a healthy thing.

340
00:15:50,443 --> 00:15:51,909
Mhmm, it is, totally.

341
00:15:51,944 --> 00:15:54,006
I mean, I've been enjoying it a lot, so.

342
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:56,523
And I live alone, and now
someone is there all the time.

343
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:58,326
- Which is great.
- Uh huh.

344
00:15:58,402 --> 00:16:00,115
But just not every day.

345
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,904
And I just... don't know what to say.

346
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,425
Well, she sort of fades into
the background after a while,

347
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,303
you know, like a smoke alarm.

348
00:16:10,397 --> 00:16:11,829
Are you just saying that
because you don't want her

349
00:16:11,864 --> 00:16:13,451
- to move back here?
- Yes, I am!

350
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:15,584
You just take some time, you know?

351
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:19,146
Carve out some time in
a day to just escape.

352
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:20,571
You know, do what you wanna do.

353
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:22,084
It's the only thing that'll keep you sane.

354
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,095
Because no, you can't
mention any of this to her,

355
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,068
she'd lose her mind.

356
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:27,631

I just noticed the time, wow.

00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:48,197
And you're all very busy, so
why don't we reschedule this

for two weeks from now, when
you're all more prepared.

365
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:54,172
Oh no, we were done
early, we got plenty of time.

Thank you, but I think
I'm fighting a little bug.

I would love to learn
from a professional singer.

Thank you.

Well, thank you, I'll leave you to discuss.

392
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,283
What's going on?

393
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,364
Um, I'm gonna sleep here tonight.

394
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:45,228
Oh, is everything okay?

395
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,337
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

396
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:50,000
Well, it's just that you've been
spending a lot of time at Mutt's.

397
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:54,674
Yeah, I know, and I actually
had to talk to him about that.

398
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:57,064
Oh, you did?

399
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,368
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

400
00:18:58,393 --> 00:19:00,408
Um, like, he brought all my stuff back,

401
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:01,884
and I was like, this is great,

402
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:04,244
but then at the same time
I was just kinda like,

403
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,376
I feel like I need my space right now.

404
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:09,570
Yeah, and that's something
that you said to him.

405
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:12,068
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we were chatting,

406
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:13,915
and I was just like, I feel
like I need to spend a few days

407
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,134
- back at the motel.
- Yeah...

408
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:18,827
That's-again, that's... You said that?

409
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:20,508
Yeah, that's what we were talking about.

410
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,736
Oh, okay. Um...

411
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,079
and how did he take that?

412
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:28,417
Um, well, I mean, I was kinda
worried about telling him.

413
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:29,910
I'm sure. Uh huh.

414
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:31,368
Because I didn't want...

415
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:33,560
I didn't wanna hurt him, and
I didn't want him to worry,

416
00:19:33,585 --> 00:19:35,686
like, oh my God, is he breaking up with me?

417
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:37,228
Is she breaking up with me?

418
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:39,202
Right, yeah, 'cause
we wouldn't want him...

419
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:40,960
to worry about that.

420
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:43,439
- Yeah, exactly.
- Mhmm.

421
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:45,892
So... but I'm really
glad that I told him,

422
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:48,283
and he took it really, really well.

423
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:50,206
- So...
- That's excellent.

424
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,447
Yep.

425
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:54,595
That's a cute little wood thing, David.

426
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:56,169
Thank you, I made it.

427
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,332
It did seem like a few of them

428
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:03,302
might've had some training,

429
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,614
but what I bring is a
certain sophistication,

430
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,907
improvisation, showmanship!

431
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:10,583
I'm sure you wowed them, honey.

432
00:20:10,631 --> 00:20:13,864
Oh John, there were definitely
lots of surprised looks.

433
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:16,247
Well, they've probably
never heard the real deal.

434
00:20:16,272 --> 00:20:17,653
I suppose!

435
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:20,618
Oh John, it felt so good

436
00:20:20,643 --> 00:20:22,896
to be working the old muscles again!

437
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,890
Riding the melody, bending the notes!

438
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:27,049
Well, they must've enjoyed it sweetheart,

439
00:20:27,074 --> 00:20:28,893
if they asked you to join.

440
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:30,263

1
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:06,437
David?

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,364
David, what is this?!

3
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:12,333
It looks like a bike.

4
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:14,442
Is it yours?

5
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:17,450
Yes. Yes, it is.

6
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,503
David, what is this doing here?

7
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:22,229
You might wanna read the note.

8
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:24,364
No, is it from Mutt?

9
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:26,560
David!

10
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:30,716
No! No!

11
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:32,763
I feel like he really gets you.

12
00:00:32,788 --> 00:00:35,841
Like, I feel like he sees
like, deep into your soul.

13
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:38,132
I'm not quite sure what
he's seeing exactly,

14
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,566
but there's definitely
- he's looking inward.

15
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:42,574
- What am I gonna do?!
- About what?

16
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:43,917
This is serious, David!

17
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:45,271
This is so off base!

18
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:46,958
Arghh!

19
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:49,292
My God, imagine what kind of ring he'd buy!

20
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:50,591
Like an opal, or something.

21
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:52,786
Ooh, like a pear-shaped opal.

22
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:55,355
Hello, is anybody home?

23
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,488
No, Mutt!

24
00:00:56,513 --> 00:00:59,251
Hey, you have to support me in this.

25
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:01,544
- Mhmm.
- You have to, do you promise me?

26
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:03,751
Oh yeah, of course.

27
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,341
- So...
- Hey you!

28
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:13,771
This is so special for me.

29
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:16,230
Well, I thought you needed a new
mode of transportation.

30
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:17,692
I do!

31
00:01:17,717 --> 00:01:20,700
I do need a mode of transportation!

32
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:24,769
And like, a car would be
nice, but, do I need a car?

33
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,021
Not anymore, it appears.

34
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,464
Well, you said you missed spin class, so...

35
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,648
I did!

36
00:01:30,682 --> 00:01:32,315
I did say that I missed spin class.

37
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:34,551
And so you bought me a bike!

38
00:01:34,585 --> 00:01:36,586
Because I said that I missed spin class.

39
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,536
Because you're so
thoughtful and perceptive.

40
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:43,133
- So you like it?
- Mm, I'd say she loves it.

41
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,278
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, you're gonna need this.

42
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:48,347
A helmet!

43
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:49,498
It came with the bike.

44
00:01:49,532 --> 00:01:51,091
I think you should put it on.

45
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,293
Like, I think you should actually like,

46
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:54,686
- like, put the helmet on.
- Yeah.

47
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,871
And I will one day,

48
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:59,638
when we take this little
pony for a joyride!

49
00:01:59,663 --> 00:02:01,927
Actually, I brought my
bike, so we can test it out.

50
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:04,427
I thought maybe we could take
a little ride to the cafe.

51
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:06,739
Ah! So fun.

52
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:09,049
I hate you, David!

53
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:11,218
See 'ya!

54
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:18,034

55
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:27,856
What about lamps?

56
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:30,704
The lamps at the motel have those uh...

57
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,761
Little bulbs,

58
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,408
these are old-fashioned big bulb lamps.

59
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:37,444
I don't see any bulbs here.

60
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:39,145
No there aren't, but the point is,

61
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:41,580
we can get big bulbs if
we have big bulb lamps.

62
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:43,949
Oh John, I don't know.

63
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:46,752
Lamps, clothing, jewelry...

64
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:48,487
Look at this poor woman's life

65
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:52,333
strewn across cheap folding tables.

66
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:55,854
John, do you think they
did this with our things?

67
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:58,028
No, not ours, no.

68
00:02:58,063 --> 00:02:59,974
They put our stuff right on the lawn.

69
00:03:01,176 --> 00:03:05,012
Strangers picking through
precious pieces we owned!

70
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:07,372
I know, and judging us,

71
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:09,140
like we're judging this poor woman.

72
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:10,642
Well, except they'd have been saying,

73
00:03:10,683 --> 00:03:12,888
"what great taste they had!"

74
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,345
I wonder who got my golf clubs.

75
00:03:15,614 --> 00:03:17,996
Really, John, that's the
first thing that comes to mind?

76
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:20,231
They were custom made.

77
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:23,225
So was my Galapagonian
tortoise-shell foot bath.

78
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,389
And now some lonely hoarder

79
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:27,505
is letting his cats poop in it.

80
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,860
Well, they were just
things, Moira, just things.

81
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:34,930
Yeah, designer,
one-of-a-kind things.

82
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:39,201
Yeah, sleek, oak-trimmed,
leather interior,

83
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:41,989
- German-engineered things.
- Oh!

84
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,810
Shopping used to cheer me up.

85
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:47,474
Big bulbs is not doing it for me.

86
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,294
Oh God.

87
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:58,855
- Roland! - Sure, I'll come in, but
just for a second.

88
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,505
Ahem!

89
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,224
Huh!

90
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:05,138
Can I help you with something?

91
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:08,872
Well um, here's the deal:

92
00:04:08,897 --> 00:04:11,052
Uh, I was thinking this morning,

93
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:12,375
and I don't wanna tell
you where I was thinking,

94
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,801
but it was a small room in my house,

95
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:15,075
- and I was sitting down...
- Okay.

96
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:17,263
And I was thinking to myself,

97
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:21,755
who can I trust to help me
pick out a woman's blouse?

98
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:25,263
And you know whose name came to mind?

99
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:27,794
I don't-i don't know, Rachel Zoe?

100
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:29,549
Yours!

101
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,884
I don't know how to take that.

102
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:34,721
- It's for Jocelyn.
- Mm!

103
00:04:34,755 --> 00:04:36,472
And you know, I would do it myself,

104
00:04:36,497 --> 00:04:38,224
it's just that you know, shopping,

105
00:04:38,258 --> 00:04:40,291
I mean, you go in, you get...

106
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:42,561
- You know, look at the stuff on the racks,
- Uh huh...

107
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:45,063
and you pick out, you know,
the color that you like,

108
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:47,265
and then you try it on
and make sure it fits you,

109
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:49,334
- Right.
- and then you buy it and you...

110
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:51,169
You're just describing what shopping is.

111
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:54,239
Yes, and normally I'm fine with that,

112
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:57,908
it's just I'm looking for
something a little fancy here.

113
00:04:57,942 --> 00:05:01,144
A little um, stylish. A little elegant.

114
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:03,046
- Ah...
- You know?

115
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:05,750
And who knows elegance
better than you, pal?

116
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:08,966
I mean, you're the only elegant guy I know!

117
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:12,513
So you're looking for me to style Jocelyn?

118
00:05:13,424 --> 00:05:15,919
Well, actually, this is
supposed to be a surprise.

119
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:18,372
So I was kinda thinking that maybe um,

120
00:05:18,397 --> 00:05:21,899
you and me could just go
out and do a little uh,

121
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:24,411
shopping together on the down low.

122
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:30,833
Y-yeah... yeah, that um...

123
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:33,141
No, we could to that, we
could do that at some point.

124
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:34,997
Oh, great! Yeah. Yeah.

125
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:36,564
Good, that's terrific.

126
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,022
So then, whenever's good for you.

127
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:41,747
Okay, great.

128
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:48,528
So you wanna-so you wanna go now?

129
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:51,225
It's a little time sensitive,
that's the only thing.

130
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:52,878
Yeah, okay, well, I take
it you have measurements,

131
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:54,481
and a mood board, then?

132
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:56,853
The whole purpose of having a bike

133
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:59,347
might be to actually ride the bike.

134
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:00,972
Yeah, I'm just not
wearing the right outfit.

135
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:02,637
It's a five minute ride.

136
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:04,270
Yeah, so by the time we get on,

137
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:06,411
and then we get off,
it's almost not worth it.

138
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:09,208
Do you not like the bike?

139
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,708
No, I love it! It's just that, um,

140
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:15,181
there are so many drunk
drivers around here.

141
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,026
It's 10:00am.

142
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:19,319
Mutt, you tell that to an alcoholic!

143
00:06:19,353 --> 00:06:20,519
Is it the color? Because I mean,

144
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,721
- it's totally fixable!
- Okay, fine.

145
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:24,396
I don't know how to ride a bike.

146
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:27,722
- What?
- I said, I don't know how to ride a bike!

147
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:33,067
Ugh!

148
00:06:39,572 --> 00:06:41,238
Moira, look at these cufflinks.

149
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,356
Oh John,

150
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:45,309
we're better off stealing
cutlery from the cafe!

151
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:47,411
No, these look like sterling.

152
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:49,146
I'm gonna bid on these.

153
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:51,015
Hey there, Roses!

154
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:52,584
- Oh, hi.
- Oh hey, Jocelyn.

155
00:06:52,618 --> 00:06:53,785
Look at you two bargain hunters.

156
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,853
You finding anything yet?

157
00:06:55,887 --> 00:06:57,454
Mm, nothing you couldn't
see fall out of a common

158
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:59,690
Christmas cracker!

159
00:06:59,724 --> 00:07:01,859
I think half the fun is panning for nuggets

160
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:05,294
- at these things.
- Ooh, look at that mattress!

161
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:08,599
Well, there you go, what a find.

162
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:11,083
Poor dear, enchanted by a death bed.

163
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:13,503
This is a brand new mattress,
it's still in the plastic!

164
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:15,325
- What?!
- Yeah!

165
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,440
And it's memory foam! This
must've cost a fortune!

166
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:20,466
Well, you're just gonna have to bid on it.

167
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:23,479
John, why didn't you
see that mattress first?!

168
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:25,515
That's something we could actually use!

169
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:28,117
- I'll use the cufflinks!
- What size is it?

170
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:30,442
Oh I don't know, it's at least a queen.

171
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:33,889
Well, that's too big to get home.

172
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:36,491
- No, we got the truck.
- But awkward, Jocelyn,

173
00:07:36,526 --> 00:07:39,093
and awkward with those
tiny doorways of yours.

174
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:40,829
Johnny, help me cover it up.

175
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:42,296
I don't want other people to see it.

176
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:48,636
Now, we need a top, and we need a bottom.

177
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,571
Like a skirt, something like that,

178
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:52,740
which I know you're familiar
with 'cause you're wearing one.

179
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:54,842
Okay, these are pants
that just so happen to have

180
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:57,978
a pant fabric over the
front and back... Okay.

181
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:00,313
Yeah, it's a skirt. Um, what about this?

182
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:02,115
It seems durable, yes?

183
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,851
Yeah um, in fashion, durable and elegant

184
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,619
rarely go hand in hand.

185
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:09,417
So I'd put that... put that back.

186
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:11,290
Okay, so not that.

187
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:13,270
What about this?

188
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:16,747
Jocelyn seems to like loud floral prints.

189
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,699
Yeah, the thing is, um,
this is kind of a special...

190
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,427
- Kind of blouse.
- Uh-huh.

191
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:25,270
Have you ever seen "The Devil Wears Prada?"

192
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,439
- Obviously!
- Okay, well,

193
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,676
Meryl Streep plays this kind of
powerful, sexy fashion woman...

194
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,478
- Yep, I've seen it!
- Okay, anyway,

195
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,246
Jocelyn and I like to have
a little fun with that idea,

196
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,181
if you know what I mean.

197
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:39,216
She plays Meryl, and I play the nervous

198
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,724
but ambitious intern who's new to the city.

199
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:45,623
Oh, so you're the...

200
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,966
So you-you're the Anne
Hathaway in that situation?

201
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:50,153
I don't know who that is.

202
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,745
Well, that's more than enough
information for me to go on.

203
00:08:54,997 --> 00:08:56,810
- You're judging me!
- I'm not!

204
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:59,152
It's just riding a bike
is a pretty basic skill.

205
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:00,927
Mm, is it though?

206
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:03,106
I think that most kids
learn how to ride a bike!

207
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,489
Yeah well, most kids also get head lice.

208
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:07,811
I'm sorry if the opportunity
never presented itself.

209
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:09,879
Oh what, there was no gap year in Belgium?

210
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:12,147
No tour de France boyfriend?

211
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:14,185
Yeah, but I never had to ride the bike!

212
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:18,988
And David, was such a little drama queen

213
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:20,911
when my parents tried teaching him,

214
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:23,104
that they threw all the
bikes into this big bonfire

215
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,597
up in the Hamptons, and we
never talked about it again.

216
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,646
Oh.

217
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:31,081
Anyway, I have lots of
skills that you don't have.

218
00:09:31,106 --> 00:09:32,433
I am sure that you do.

219
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:34,135
Like, have you ever had
to negotiate in Arabic?

220
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:36,153
- It is very difficult.
- I believe you.

221
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:37,772
And try getting into "Kiss Kiss" in Tokyo

222
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:39,607
without a lock of human hair.

223
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:41,442
Now, you see, if you can do all that,

224
00:09:41,476 --> 00:09:43,344
I'm pretty sure that you
can learn to ride a bike.

225
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:48,509
Alexis?

226
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:53,355
Sorry, I was just thinking
about this crazy night

227
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,833
at "Kiss Kiss."

228
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,356
Well, this might be the closest
we're gonna get to Meryl.

229
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:09,089
You know, if she got fired
from her job at the magazine,

230
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:11,044
and started walking the streets.

231
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:13,973
Oh, that's a good one! We
haven't tried that one yet.

232
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:15,875
- Yeah, I wouldn't.
- No, it's a good idea.

233
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:18,130
Missing Peter Pan?

234
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:21,579
I'm sorry?

235
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:24,675
Well, because I see a
couple of "Lost Boys."

236
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:32,300
Hi, I'm Wendy. Are we shopping
for a mother, a girlfriend?

237
00:10:32,325 --> 00:10:34,125
- Actually, my wife.
- Oh!

238
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,488
Yeah, we've got it under control though,

239
00:10:35,513 --> 00:10:36,626
so thank you so much.

240
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:38,724
Oh well, very well, then.

241
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:41,999
If you need me, I'll be right here.

242
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:44,267
I know how hard it can be for two men

243
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:46,606
in a women's clothing store.

244
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:48,739
Well, I'm actually in really good hands,

245
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,075
because this man has a woman's touch.

246
00:10:51,388 --> 00:10:53,888
I don't... I don't know what that means.

247
00:10:57,371 --> 00:10:59,371
Okay, so we're going with these two pieces.

248
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:03,766
Oh well, I have to ask,
is this for a funeral?

249
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,902
Because we do offer bereavement discounts.

250
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:08,604
No, why would you think that?

251
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:12,274
Well, just very somber, serious pieces.

252
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:14,030
Well, we don't want that!

253
00:11:14,055 --> 00:11:16,210
Well, they're not... If you're willing,

254
00:11:16,245 --> 00:11:18,413
I have a few new pieces that just came in,

255
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:20,584
I'd love for you to see them.

256
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:22,752
I just don't know if we need to be
adding any more options to the mix.

257
00:11:22,777 --> 00:11:24,285
Well, if she's offering,
what's the problem?

258
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:27,885
Everything in here is
like one big, tacky blouse.

259
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,230
Oh, come on, that's silly.

260
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:34,294
Now, I know you men like to play it safe,

261
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:37,631
but I just thought, why not shake it up?

262
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:40,233
- Ugh!
- Oh, I like these!

263
00:11:40,268 --> 00:11:42,469
- Um... Hmm?
- Mhmm!

264
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:44,872
- Are they durable?
- Oh well,

265
00:11:44,906 --> 00:11:47,807
durability a given here
at the "Blouse Barn."

266
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,442
And if you're asking my opinion...

267
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,511
Are we, though?

268
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:54,285
It's between these two.

269
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:58,785
Well, this is a real "Sophie's Choice!"

270
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,820
I hope that you and Jocelyn
don't role play that at home.

271
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,221
Hell, we've played every Streep movie.

272
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,300
Oh, okay. Um...

273
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:07,692
Would you describe either
of those as "quick release?"

274
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,916
Funnily enough, both have snaps.

275
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:12,597
Oh, great!

276
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15,558
Well, then I guess I um...

277
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:17,761
Well...

278
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:21,675
Uh, which one do you like?

279
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:26,510
I don't know, it's such a tough choice.

280
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,546
Oh, you're tellin' me!

281
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,314
It's just that I'm finding
both of these options

282
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:32,941
- to be a little um...
- What?

283
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:35,052
Well, I don't know, we've
just spent so much time

284
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:38,877
and energy finding the few
pieces that aren't um...

285
00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:41,157
- Uh...
- What?!

286
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:43,059
I'm trying to find the
word to describe what I...

287
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:45,462
Oh! Flirty? Sassy?

288
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:48,665
Skanky! I think the
clothes are a bit skanky.

289
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:51,033
Hmm.

290
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:54,277
Well! Skanky.

291
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:58,558
We'll um, take the funereal skirt then,

292
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:01,910
and the skanky blouse.

293
00:13:01,945 --> 00:13:04,179
And sold!

294
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:06,849
To Johnny Rose, for the
price of $15 dollars!

295
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:08,550
Which uh, I hope you can afford.

296
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:10,752
You know, considering
your financial situation.

297
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:12,454
Yeah, I get it Ray, I get it. I get it.

298
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:15,255
I've got cash, and I'd just
like my cufflinks, please.

299
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,725
And now, moving on to bedroom items.

300
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,105
First we'll have a brand new queen sized

301
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:23,121
memory foam mattress.

302
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:25,366
We'll start the bidding
on the bed at $50 dollars.

303
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:27,496
We have $50!

304
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:29,870
- $60!
- Moira.

305
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:32,549
- Ssh!
- Ooh, I smell a bidding war!

306
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:34,385
- Do we have $70?
- $70!

307
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,976
$70! Do I have $75?

308
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,411
- $75!
- Moira, what are you doing?

309
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:40,113
We are currently sleeping
on a rectangular collection

310
00:13:40,147 --> 00:13:41,549
of knives and barbed wire, John.

311
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:43,416
$75, do we have $80?

312
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:44,718
- $80!
- $80!

313
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:46,919
- $90!
- Moira, we can't afford this!

314
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:48,821
- You got the cufflinks!
- For $15 dollars!

315
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:50,990
- $90! Do we have $100?
- $100!

316
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:53,652
- $100!
- You just bid against yourself!

317
00:13:53,677 --> 00:13:54,550
Do I hear $105?

318
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:57,143
Do you remember what we used
to sleep on? Texas Kings!

319
00:13:57,168 --> 00:14:00,627
- $130!
- Wow, $130! Do I hear $135?

320
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:02,300
- $140!
- $150!

321
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:04,235
- $160!
- Moira, I'm begging you!

322
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,203
Oh, she has a decent bed, John,

323
00:14:06,238 --> 00:14:07,471
- she's just being greedy!
- $165, anyone?

324
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:09,641
- $170!
- You did it again!

325
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:11,175
- I know what I'm doing!
- $170! $180?

326
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:13,096
- Ray, I think we're done here!
- $180!

327
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:15,580
$180! Do I hear $190?

328
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,150
One-nine... two hundred!

329
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:20,551
$200! Wow, Mrs. Rose.

330
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:23,253
You're really going for
it, which is surprising...

331
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:26,056
Yeah, Ray, you know what,
that was just a joke bid, so.

332
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,925
Oh, I understand.

333
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,392
Unfortunately that joke
bid is currently our highest

334
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:31,494
at $200 dollars!

335
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:35,238
Going once, going twice,
two hundred and one!

336
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:40,011
- $201 going once, going twice,
- Don't!

337
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:44,173
Sold, to Jocelyn Schitt, for $201 dollars.

338
00:14:50,614 --> 00:14:53,293
Well, thank you for this delightful trip.

339
00:14:53,318 --> 00:14:55,307
You know, I'm starting to
get the feeling that uh,

340
00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:56,585
you're a little upset.

341
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:58,319
What would give you that impression?

342
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:00,388
Well, I first noticed
it when heart came on,

343
00:15:00,422 --> 00:15:03,441
and nobody was taking the high parts.

344
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,160
- Oh my God!
- Look you should feel good about yourself!

345
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:08,830
Come on, you made some great choices today.

346
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:11,088
Nothing we bought today came anywhere close

347
00:15:11,113 --> 00:15:12,541
to something Meryl Streep would wear

348
00:15:12,566 --> 00:15:14,101
in "The Devil Wears Prada," nothing!

349
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:16,436
Oh jeez, you are so touchy!

350
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:19,773
God, you're like a
- a fancy dinner plate

351
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:24,211
that you don't wanna nudge
off the edge of the table.

352
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:25,715
Okay, I don't know what that means.

353
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,444
Um listen, I don't have a
lot to my name right now,

354
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,002
but I do have one thing.

355
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:33,052
- Self-respect?
- No, taste.

356
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:35,488
And when that is not appreciated,

357
00:15:35,522 --> 00:15:39,926
or worse, publicly undermined, publicly...

358
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,061
Uh yeah, I might get a little upset.

359
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:43,763
Look, David-David!

360
00:15:43,797 --> 00:15:46,564
Listen.

361
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:49,234
If I wasn't so easily
swayed by powerful women

362
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:52,144
in a retail environment, I
would've been there for you.

363
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:56,074
Okay, because I honestly
believe that really do

364
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:59,808
have a very, very sharp eye.

365
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:03,191
Thank you, that's nice of you to say.

366
00:16:03,448 --> 00:16:05,382
Trust me, when Joc sees this blouse,

367
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,884
I'm gonna make sure
she knows you're the one

368
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:08,318
- that picked it out.
- I didn't pick that blouse.

369
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:09,736
I know, but I'm gonna tell her you did.

370
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,294
Okay, thanks so much.

371
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:21,597
- This is ridiculous!
- This is how you learn.

372
00:16:21,622 --> 00:16:23,041
Everyone is looking at me, Mutt!

373
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,600
No one is looking at you!

374
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:26,941
- Ugh!
- Is everything okay?

375
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,839
People were saying that a girl
was struggling with her bike.

376
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:32,008
I kinda just assumed it was a toddler.

377
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:34,243
No, I am a grown adult young woman.

378
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:35,745
Okay, this is how my dad taught me,

379
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,355
and this is how I'm teaching you!

380
00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:40,933
I'm glad I knew how to
ride a bike when we dated.

381
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,252
Yeah, I don't really trust
your dad in terms of like,

382
00:16:43,277 --> 00:16:45,160
"teachable moments."

383
00:16:45,185 --> 00:16:47,656
You know, one of my mom's
boyfriends had a really great trick.

384
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:49,892
He used to say, "one foot on the ground,

385
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,347
one foot on the pedal, now
get the hell outta here!"

386
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:54,569
Hey, that's fun, I like
that, let's try that.

387
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,197
Okay fine, I'm just saying,

388
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:57,431
if it's something you never did before...

389
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,754
- There you go!
- Okay, wait!

390
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:03,337
Are you coming, or do I just
keep like, driving straight?

391
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:05,272
I didn't teach you how to brake yet!

392
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:08,042
Get the hell outta here, you dumb broad!

393
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:10,223
That was another thing he used to say.

394
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,490
Hey. Roland!

395
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:26,785
Johnny, um, do you have a minute?

396
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:29,754
- Yeah.
- Come here.

397
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:32,765
What's going on?

398
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,800
Well Johnny, I'm about to make you

399
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:38,105
the most popular guy in room 6.

400
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:39,972
Is this the mattress?

401
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:42,141
Okay, yeah, I've got a big heart,

402
00:17:42,175 --> 00:17:43,743
all right, don't spread it around.

403
00:17:43,777 --> 00:17:46,394
I talked Jocelyn into letting you have it.

404
00:17:47,312 --> 00:17:49,300
You're giving us the mattress?

405
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,652
Well, practically, it's
yours for $200 bucks.

406
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:55,954
That's a dollar less than you paid for it!

407
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:58,489
Johnny, it's barely out of the plastic.

408
00:17:58,808 --> 00:18:00,183
We can't afford it.

409
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,604
Oh I see, you're the master
negotiator at work here, huh?

410
00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:07,222
Okay, um, $195.

411
00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:08,899
We can't afford it!

412
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:10,916
Okay, hardball, huh? I'll play.

413
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:12,702
Um, $182.50.

414
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:16,373
- All right, bye, Roland.
- Fifty bucks.

415
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:18,508
Fifty?

416
00:18:18,738 --> 00:18:21,238
Look, I'll level with you, okay?

417
00:18:21,263 --> 00:18:25,754
Um, we tried it out as soon
as Jocelyn brought it home.

418
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:29,218
You tried it out?

419
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:30,686
Yeah, not enough bounce for the bumps,

420
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,924
- if you know what I mean.
- Hmm.

421
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:34,791
But given your advanced years,

422
00:18:34,825 --> 00:18:37,492
it might just be the
thing for you and Moira.

423
00:18:37,526 --> 00:18:39,621
Yeah well, we're not that old...

424
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:42,837
But $50?

425
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:49,104
Kudos to you, Mr. Rose.

426
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,986
I can't believe I'm saying this,

427
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:52,807
but I'm so comfortable!

428
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,285
Well, only the best for you, my dear.

429
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:58,668
Yet they didn't want it?

430
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:02,449
Oh, I think they just felt sorry for us.

431
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:04,597
Well, that seems strange, John.

432
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,183
Especially since Jocelyn
paid over $200 for it.

433
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:09,889
You know what I think, I
think they tried it out,

434
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:12,433
and uh, it just didn't work for them.

435
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:20,941
And by tried it out, you mean...

436
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:26,687
I mean they... tried it out.

437
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:31,186
Eww! Oh God! No! Oh! Oh!

438
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,611
Oh God, that's memory foam, John!

439
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:35,981
Oh Moira, we've stayed at Kennedy compound,

440
00:19:36,015 --> 00:19:37,582
Oh! This can't be any worse than that!

441
00:19:37,616 --> 00:19:39,284
The Kennedys aren't Roland!

442
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,887
The Kennedys have regular
medicals, daily laundering!

443
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:44,222
This has gotta be better
than the motel mattress

444
00:19:44,256 --> 00:19:47,730
we were using, I mean, who
knows who tried that out!

445
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:49,933
Is that supposed to be helping me?!

446
00:19:50,151 --> 00:19:53,652
Moira, this is a $50
dollar gift from heaven.

447
00:19:53,972 --> 00:19:55,566
I mean, look, hey!

448
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,793
I don't feel any springs,
no nails, no bolts!

449
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:01,660
It's comfy, come to bed.

450
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:03,916
Tomorrow we get a mattress cover.

451
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:06,873
Yes, yes, that's the spirit.

452
00:20:06,898 --> 00:20:08,131
Oh...

453
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:13,746
- Oh!
- Mm!

454
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,353
Ahh...

455
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:21,949
Seriously, don't think about it.

456
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:24,088
Okay, ***

457
00:20:24,113 --> 00:20:25,546
I don't even wanna do this!

458
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:26,980
David, you're gonna feel so good, trust me.

459
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:27,972
Oh my God, you know that I have bad

460
00:20:27,997 --> 00:20:30,050
foot-eye coordination,
you didn't have to wear

461
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:31,543
corrective leg braces for three months.

462
00:20:31,568 --> 00:20:33,941
You can't blame everything on
having been pigeon-toed, David.

463
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,832
- Oh my God!
- Kids, your mother and I are gonna...

464
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:38,225
Oh my God, David, what are you doing?!

465
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:39,707
I'm teaching him how to ride a bike!

466
00:20:39,732 --> 00:20:42,662
Oh please don't, you know I
can't stand the sight of blood.

467
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:44,396
Seriously son, you're gonna hurt yourself!

468
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:46,298
David, it is one foot on the pedal,

469
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,134
and one foot on the ground, and
then get the hell out of here!

470
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:49,401
Okay? I don't know what that means.

471
00:20:49,436 --> 00:20:51,237
Okay, I'm gonna hold the back.

472
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:52,705
Aah! He's coming, come on, come on!

473
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,441
Oh, okay-aah! Aah! Aah!

474
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:56,976
David, the pedals make it move more!

475
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,019
- John, he's doing it!
- You're doing it, son!

476
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:03,896
Oh my God.

477
00:21:06,052 --> 00:21:07,986
- Yay!
- Woo Hoo Hoo!

478
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,465
Hey, someone get my camera!

479
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,523
- Nobody get a camera!
- David! Over here!

480
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:20,798
Alexis.

481
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,621
I'm sleeping!

482
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:25,550
Oh, honey.

483
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,837
Honey, I need to ask you

484
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:27,938
a serious question,

485
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,206
has it gotten worse or are you

486
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,465
just not wearing any makeup?

487
00:21:32,418 --> 00:21:37,644

1
00:00:00,664 --> 00:00:02,031
(Key rattles)

2
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:06,490
(Door shuts)

3
00:00:06,524 --> 00:00:08,292
Hi.

4
00:00:08,326 --> 00:00:09,660
Hi.

5
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:12,229
Um, your agent called; do
you have any safety pins?

6
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:14,015
My agent?

7
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:15,652
Which one?

8
00:00:15,677 --> 00:00:18,246
I think the assistant
said her name was Jennifer?

9
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:20,795
Ginnifer? Or Jennifer with a "G?"

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,939
There's more than one!

11
00:00:22,203 --> 00:00:23,734
They sent you an email.

12
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:25,409
Is it a job?

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,967
I don't know, do I look like Ginnifer?!

14
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:30,881
David, your inability
to retain information

15
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,225
that doesn't directly pertain to you

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,585
might actually require
medical attention!

17
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:37,609
Are they sending a script?

18
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:40,639
David there's nothing here but...

19
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:42,718
"hot singles in my area."

20
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:45,162
No, wait, wait.

21
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:49,437
David, it's an audition
for a feature film!

22
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,276
Well, that sounds promising.

23
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,568
"Attractive and spunky
forty-something female."

24
00:00:54,593 --> 00:00:55,750
In my sleep!

25
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,784
"Respected ornithologist
Dr. Clara Mandrake,"

26
00:00:59,818 --> 00:01:03,218
in the psychological thriller,
"The Crows Have Eyes... Two."

27
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,790
It's a sequel, that's good.

28
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:07,717
It must mean the first
one was a big success.

29
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:09,132
I've never heard of it.

30
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,362
Well, they want me
to put myself on tape.

31
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:12,807
David, do you still have that camera?

32
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:14,070
Go get it, please!

33
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:15,234
And a drop cloth.

34
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:16,664
And a ring light.

35
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:19,481
I could probably prop my
phone against some books.

36
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:25,962
And so it begins again.

37

38
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:37,333
(Door opens)

39
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:40,149
Good morning.

40
00:01:42,027 --> 00:01:44,031
I'd like to book some rooms, please.

41
00:01:44,196 --> 00:01:46,664
Oh, well, that's wonderful.

42
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:49,267
Good... good.

43
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:51,335
Um, is there a problem?

44
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:54,005
Uh no, no problem.

45
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,656
I can certainly handle this.

46
00:01:56,809 --> 00:02:00,011
My associate usually works the computer,

47
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:01,265
But uh...

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,247
let's get you booked.

49
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:05,820
I'd like to book three rooms.

50
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:07,852
Three rooms?

51
00:02:07,886 --> 00:02:09,253
Okay...

52
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:13,458
- Now will that be uh, three...
- (Chimes)

53
00:02:13,492 --> 00:02:15,170
separate uh, bookings?

54
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:18,318
You see, there's a
conference over in Elmdale,

55
00:02:18,343 --> 00:02:22,166
and I was hoping to use
the motel as a kind of a...

56
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:26,004
breakout space to conduct
my own business out of,

57
00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:28,272
- for the next two days.
- (Computer chimes)

58
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:30,408
During the afternoons.

59
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,953
- (Computer beeps repeatedly)
- Okay, we seem to be...

60
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:34,612
having a bit of a problem
with the system here,

61
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:36,681
but not to worry.

62
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:38,242
Are you new at this?

63
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:41,152
Ish. (Laughs)

64
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:43,855
Well, not to complicate
things for you even more,

65
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:46,523
um, Johnny, but...

66
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,503
I would love if we
could work out some kind

67
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:50,028
of a discounted deal,

68
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:52,296
seeing as we're not
gonna be needing the rooms

69
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:54,132
during the evenings.

70
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:57,711
Okay, um... tell you what.

71
00:02:57,736 --> 00:03:00,921
Why don't I go to a fresh...

72
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:03,241
page here,

73
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:05,309
and we'll get this done.

74
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,601
Lickety-split, okay.

75
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,828
- So...
- I would love to pay cash.

76
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:12,590
Whew!

77
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,251
Even better.

78
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:19,631
Moira: From what I
understand it's between me,

79
00:03:19,656 --> 00:03:21,492
and one other actress.

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,928
Congratulations, Mrs. Rose!

81
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:25,329
Who's the other actress?

82
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:27,198
- Well, they haven't found her yet.
- Oh.

83
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:28,900
But if all goes according to plan,

84
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:30,435
(Knocks on wood)

85
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:32,737
they'll be flying me
out for a screen test!

86
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:35,706
Moira, I was just thinking about you!

87
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:37,312
Well, thank you.

88
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:40,078
What if we switched parts?

89
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:42,780
- Switch parts?
- For the duet next week.

90
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:45,453
Oh Jocelyn, the duet.

91
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:47,885
I must apologize,

92
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,132
there seems to have
been a change of plans.

93
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:52,490
Moira's gonna be in a movie!

94
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:54,092
(Moira and Twyla laugh)

95
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:56,294
- A movie?
- Well...

96
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:59,531
I'm sure you've seen
"The Crows Have Eyes."

97
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,039
This would be the
second in the franchise.

98
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:04,769
- Wow.
- Mhmm.

99
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:07,872
I have never heard of
it, but congratulations.

100
00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:09,240
Thank you.

101
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:11,008
Shame about the duet, though.

102
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,857
Yeah, we were gonna have a
pretty incredible audience

103
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:15,313
for the performance next week.

104
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:17,875
Big tour group coming through, so...

105
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:20,852
Then you'll cut the number.

106
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,945
No, I don't think that's
a possibility, actually.

107
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:29,842
Twyla, what if you took Moira's part

108
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:31,429
for the duet next week?

109
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:35,835
(Gasps) I would be honored!

110
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:38,503
God, it'd be such big shoes to fill.

111
00:04:38,537 --> 00:04:40,071
No, Twyla, no.

112
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:41,839
No deprecatory mocking.

113
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:44,041
One must champion oneself and say,

114
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:46,679
I am ready for this!

115
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:49,447
Otherwise, the pressure
could be crippling.

116
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:53,006
Look at this filth!

117
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:55,920
"Community center adds ramp."

118
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:57,288
No, this.

119
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:58,723
He says the comma's a typo,

120
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,201
but it has run that way
three years in a row!

121
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:02,367
Who is this person?

122
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:04,272
He looks like if Ricky Martin
and Mark Consuelos had a baby.

123
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:06,553
It's the competition,
and he's selling his body

124
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:08,666
to get clients, it's disgusting!

125
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,411
You could probably take
just as sexy a photo

126
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,836
if you wanted to.

127
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,271
I could definitely take just a...

128
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:14,453
I don't want to.

129
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:16,062
Let me ask you this question.

130
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:18,982
Why should the person who is
performing surgery on your pet

131
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:20,344
have to have a six pack?!

132
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:22,647
- You have a six pack.
- That's not the point!

133
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:24,617
And... it's not a full six yet,

134
00:05:24,642 --> 00:05:25,757
That's why I'm shredding right now.

135
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:28,428
I don't know, it looks like
a pretty smart campaign to me.

136
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,154
If he wants to sell sex,

137
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:32,557
then he should just get a
job down at the Dude Cave!

138
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:34,392
He'd make more money than being a vet!

139
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:36,093
Um, what's the Dude Cave?

140
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,396
It's the all male strip
club outside of town.

141
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,273
My cousin Dwayne works
there; he drives a Corvette.

142
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,900
Okay...

143
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:45,475
Listen, you might wanna
think about spicing up

144
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,704
your approach a little bit.

145
00:05:46,738 --> 00:05:48,873
The bottom line is that
I did not go to med school

146
00:05:48,907 --> 00:05:50,982
just to exploit innocent puppies

147
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:52,743
as a cover for my extreme vanity!

148
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:54,779
But people love extreme vanity!

149
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,214
And they love puppies,

150
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:57,659
so you have to give them
at least one of the two.

151
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:59,335
I don't know.

152
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:02,453
Oh! What about the bunnies
that we have up for adoption?

153
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,154
We can set up like, a little bunny cam,

154
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:05,590
and stream it live from our clinic.

155
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:08,192
That is very popular with
people who hate their jobs,

156
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:10,093
or are in loveless marriages.

157
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:12,463
Are those the people
we wanna be targeting?

158
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,864
Well, it's free marketing,

159
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,266
and you can find little homes

160
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,023
for those little bunnies
that don't have any houses.

161
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,203
Fine!

162
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:22,640
But if those bunnies feel
exploited even a little bit,

163
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:24,460
- I am pulling the plug!
- Yes.

164
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:26,437
Honeypea.

165
00:06:29,648 --> 00:06:31,048
Moira: Okay...

166
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,351
this is really taking me back.

167
00:06:33,385 --> 00:06:34,601
(Coughs)

168
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,988
Okay David, I'll need
you to count me in.

169
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,823
Okay, um, from what?

170
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,258
Start from five,

171
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:42,493
you leave out the two, and the one.

172
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,861
Okay, why?

173
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:46,703
Because it's my process.

174
00:06:47,187 --> 00:06:49,233
Okay. Um...

175
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:51,593
Five, four...

176
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:54,365
One.

177
00:06:55,634 --> 00:06:57,101
Look what you've done!

178
00:06:57,455 --> 00:06:58,822
Look at it!

179
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:01,545
Lying there, lifeless.

180
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,347
Yet, in its eyes,

181
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:05,577
I see darkness.

182
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:09,451
It's just a crow, Mrs. Mandrake.

183
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:10,921
Dr. Mandrake.

184
00:07:10,956 --> 00:07:12,323
And you must be kidding yourself

185
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:14,191
if you don't think more are not coming.

186
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,626
They always do.

187
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:17,194
They're watching you, Gareth.

188
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,163
The crows have eyes.

189
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:21,468
And you better not look them in it.

190
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,903
Uh, it-it's just a flock
of crows, Dr. Mandrake.

191
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,085
What's the worst that can happen?

192
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,812
Oh, you'll see!

193
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:34,390
And it's not a flock, my dear boy...

194
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,187
it's a murder.

195
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,892
Yes, I said murder.

196
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,388
Gareth, murder!

197
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,693
Sorry, um, this is...

198
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:49,460
just one big rip off of "The Birds!"

199
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:50,861
This is about crows!

200
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:52,263
It's much more specific!

201
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:53,664
And the dialogue!

202
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,066
"Look, they've taken Clara!"

203
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,568
"Where are they carrying her to, Clara?"

204
00:07:57,671 --> 00:07:59,370
Are there two Claras?!

205
00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:00,738
It's a common name.

206
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,106
Yeah, the next scene takes place

207
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,320
in a large bird's nest.

208
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:06,911
Rarely is the material of quality,

209
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,265
the challenge is to
lift it off the page.

210
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,825
And I think part of the problem, David,

211
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,516
is that I'm getting nothing from you.

212
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:14,335
It's like working off a corpse.

213
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:17,088
I actually think you
do play off a corpse

214
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,148
in the next scene, and...

215
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,359
if I'm being perfectly honest,

216
00:08:21,393 --> 00:08:25,234
this is all playing a bit big.

217
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,070
Hmph! Big.

218
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:31,135
- Yeah.
- And would that be a note?

219
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:33,992
A note, coming from my son?!

220
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:36,795
Who I carried for almost
a full seven months,

221
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,482
to an actress who has been short-listed

222
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:42,059
for more than seven major

223
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:44,719
made for television motion pictures?

224
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:49,742
The script is nothing more
than a jumping off point.

225
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:52,218
Oh, okay.

226
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:55,281
Let's take it again,
I'll count myself in.

227
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,596
- Five, four, three, two...
- (Camera beeps)

228
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:07,250
Johnny: Great news!

229
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:10,074
Your new partner just
booked three rooms,

230
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:12,734
before you even got in this morning.

231
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:14,312
Wow.

232
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,757
Ha!

233
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:19,982
Three rooms, two days,

234
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:22,319
"afternoons only, Trish."

235
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,754
What's afternoons only?

236
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:25,122
Well, I gave her a discount,

237
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:27,562
because she's only using
the rooms during the day.

238
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:29,921
So you're renting our
rooms by the hour?!

239
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:32,522
We haven't had a guest in four days!

240
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:34,732
What are they using the rooms for?

241
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:36,167
Well, she didn't say,

242
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,135
Just conducting her
business out of them.

243
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,710
Right, and you know what that means.

244
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,712
- No.
- Yeah.

245
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:50,448
No, I-I don't believe you.

246
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:51,859
Let me guess, this has something to do

247
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,584
with the accountants conference?

248
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:56,353
Yes.

249
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,822
No, no, you're mistaken.

250
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:00,057
Stevie, she would've
disclosed that information

251
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:01,625
if that were the case!

252
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,135
- Really?
- No...

253
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:07,031
But look, if it makes
you feel any better,

254
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,963
we'll go and check it out.

255
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:11,335
But when it turns out I'm right,

256
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,804
and it's just a group
of business professionals

257
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,179
decompressing for a few hours,

258
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:20,444
during a... long day at a regional
accountants' conference,

259
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:23,614
then I expect a full apology.

260
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:25,916
You don't hear it, when
you say it like that?

261
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:27,351
I hear it a bit.

262
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:34,525
♪

263
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,884
(Crickets chirp)

264
00:10:39,564 --> 00:10:40,931
- Hi.
- Come look at this,

265
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:42,333
look at the bunnies!

266
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:46,036
Oh... (gasps)

267
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:48,003
Cute!

268
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:52,453
This isn't one of those
animal rights viral videos

269
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:53,844
where the bunnies go through

270
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:54,964
a meat processor in the end, is it?

271
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,389
Ew, no, David.

272
00:10:56,715 --> 00:10:59,350
I set this up to get people
to visit Ted's website.

273
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:00,851
Poor thing is, like, out of it

274
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:02,820
when it comes to selling himself.

275
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:05,422
There are 200 people
watching this, David!

276
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,558
That's like, double
your Instagram followers.

277
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:10,961
Okay, my account is private, thanks.

278
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:12,199
Mhmm...

279
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,299
There's Ted.

280
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:17,128
Yeah, sometimes he comes in and out.

281
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,769
Um...

282
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,347
Ted is taking his clothes off.

283
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,043
You wish, David.

284
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:30,371
No, Ted is getting naked on your webcam!

285
00:11:31,597 --> 00:11:33,439
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

286
00:11:33,464 --> 00:11:36,086
I emailed our entire client
list about this, David!

287
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:38,245
I emailed his parents!

288
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:42,222
I'm obsessed with this.

289
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:46,503
This is incredible!

290
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:49,972
(Gasps)

291
00:11:49,997 --> 00:11:51,364
No, no, no, no, no, no!

292
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:57,667
- Ted looks good.
- Yeah, he does.

293
00:11:57,876 --> 00:12:00,791
- David, he looks really good.
- Okay, that's gross.

294
00:12:01,646 --> 00:12:03,714
Okay, so...

295
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:07,344
(Gasps) David!

296
00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:15,213
<i>Oh, hi.</i>

297
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:19,360
Hi. Uh, I and my associate,

298
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:21,853
just wanted to... come
by and check on you,

299
00:12:21,878 --> 00:12:26,572
and see how you're enjoying
your... multiple room stay?

300
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:29,743
Oh, we're doing just fine, thank you.

301
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:31,569
Good, good, good.

302
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:34,705
Because we've heard through
the rumor mill that um...

303
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:37,942
there have been some
unannounced visitors

304
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:40,878
staying in the rooms we rented you.

305
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:43,912
Visitors who may be engaging in mature,

306
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:47,160
if not... adult activities.

307
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:48,166
And?

308
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:51,768
And that's something we didn't discuss.

309
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:54,558
Miss, if I were to tell you...

310
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:55,993
Oh no, no, I got it immediately,

311
00:12:56,027 --> 00:12:57,394
and I wasn't even there, so.

312
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:58,729
Okay, well unfortunately,

313
00:12:58,763 --> 00:13:01,298
we're gonna have to
ask you to shut it down.

314
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,666
Oh, you have nothing to
worry about, Mr. Rose.

315
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,470
We're a very high-end operation,

316
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:08,877
and very discreet.

317
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,077
Besides, people are
making love in these rooms,

318
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:14,645
whether they rent by the day,

319
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,514
the week, or the hour.

320
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:19,833
Yeah...

321
00:13:20,252 --> 00:13:21,971
Yeah, well...

322
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:24,529
Point taken.

323
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:26,981
Wow.

324
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:32,906
(Door shuts)

325
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,298
(Light knock on the door)

326
00:13:36,055 --> 00:13:37,422
(Cars rumble)

327
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:40,871
Hey, you know, I've tried to add

328
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,283
an extra half hour to my morning run,

329
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:44,276
but my body just isn't having it.

330
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:46,810
- Well, you look great.
- Thanks.

331
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:48,946
Um, about the bunny cam...

332
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,681
I know, it's a huge hit!

333
00:13:50,715 --> 00:13:52,326
We've gotten like nine
new customers overnight!

334
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,728
And some of them don't even have pets,

335
00:13:53,752 --> 00:13:55,196
they just want to discuss whether or not

336
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,315
they should get a pet.

337
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,307
Ted, the camera can see you.

338
00:13:59,908 --> 00:14:01,592
Okay, so should I like,

339
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:03,027
wave or something, next time?

340
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:05,932
Nope, the camera can see you...

341
00:14:06,852 --> 00:14:09,287
like, after your run.

342
00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:11,811
Oh.

343
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:19,286
Oh no, why didn't you tell
me the camera could see me

344
00:14:19,311 --> 00:14:20,678
when I get back from my runs?!

345
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:21,775
I just noticed!

346
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,457
Actually, David noticed
first last night,

347
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:26,183
but that's exactly when
there is a huge spike

348
00:14:26,217 --> 00:14:27,551
in the website.

349
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:30,424
- I'm worse than Dr. Miguel!
- No, you didn't know!

350
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:32,523
Although there was a moment last night,

351
00:14:32,557 --> 00:14:34,725
where it looked like
you might have known,

352
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,360
and you were doing this like,

353
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:37,995
- thing with your hips.
- Alexis!

354
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,064
No, I know, of course you didn't know.

355
00:14:40,098 --> 00:14:41,432
Of course!

356
00:14:41,466 --> 00:14:44,143
Um, don't worry, I'm gonna
take it down right now.

357
00:14:45,855 --> 00:14:47,189
W-Wait.

358
00:14:47,214 --> 00:14:50,541
You said you saw a spike
in the website views?

359
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:53,577
People were very concerned
as to whether or not

360
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:55,946
you would get your
pants on successfully.

361
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:58,895
Well...

362
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:02,386
who's to say that
people weren't watching

363
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,775
for the bunnies?

364
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:06,807
I am, that's what I'm saying.

365
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:11,307
I feel that until
these guys are adopted,

366
00:15:11,763 --> 00:15:13,641
we can't take it down,
that'd be bad for business,

367
00:15:13,665 --> 00:15:15,275
for the bunnies' sake.

368
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:18,424
I'll just have to be
more careful next time.

369
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,738
Um hello, who are you,

370
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:22,940
and what did you do
with Theodore Mullins?

371
00:15:22,974 --> 00:15:24,375
Well, what can I say,

372
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:26,260
sometimes I like to live dangerously.

373
00:15:26,478 --> 00:15:29,510
While still respecting
my personal boundaries.

374
00:15:30,148 --> 00:15:31,715
- Yes.
- (Ted laughs)

375
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,893
Moira: David!

376
00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:39,338
So what is it?

377
00:15:39,924 --> 00:15:41,291
- It's an email.
- Mhmm!

378
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:42,703
Subject line, "The Crows Have Eyes II."

379
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:44,528
- Mhmm.
- And?

380
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:47,264
I don't know, I'd like
you to read it, please.

381
00:15:47,298 --> 00:15:48,666
(David sighs)

382
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:55,369
- You booked it.
- Ohhhh!

383
00:15:55,394 --> 00:15:58,174
David! I did?

384
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,044
What'd they say about me?

385
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:01,283
They need you to sign the contract!

386
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,856
Well, that's standard!

387
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:04,248
What are the terms?

388
00:16:04,282 --> 00:16:06,417
Ooh, it's filming in Bosnia!

389
00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:08,285
Um, in a city that I don't,

390
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:09,687
I don't know the name of the city,

391
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:11,232
I can't pronounce it,
a lot of consonants.

392
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:12,822
I did not know that.

393
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:14,766
But I've always loved
shooting on location,

394
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,869
it allows one to focus on the work.

395
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:19,830
Hmm, it's being released in Bosnia,

396
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,424
Croatia,

397
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:23,033
Herzegovina.

398
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:25,119
Before opening internationally!

399
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:27,658
You have to fly yourself there?

400
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:30,731
Mmm, that doesn't sound right.

401
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,655
Ooh, accommodation is covered.

402
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,147
Thank God!

403
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:38,455
You'll be put up with a local family.

404
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:43,053
Close to the set?

405
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:44,658
They're paying you scale.

406
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,391
But it'll be in Baltic currency,

407
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:48,859
do you want me to keep going?

408
00:16:48,893 --> 00:16:50,828
No, read to yourself.

409
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,299
- There's a death waiver?!
- Ohh!

410
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,250
You can close the computer.

411
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:57,571
Yeah, but we haven't
even gotten to the section

412
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:58,702
on bird safety yet!

413
00:16:58,737 --> 00:17:00,158
Shut it! Now.

414
00:17:05,636 --> 00:17:07,003
What if...

415
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:10,815
Hmm.

416
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,338
No, thank you.

417
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:15,272
(Door opens)

418
00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:21,792
Have a nice rest of the day.

419
00:17:25,697 --> 00:17:28,031
Hey Johnny, wow!

420
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:29,633
This place is hopping!

421
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,835
Yeah, well, it's uh,
it's been a busy week.

422
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,804
Uh huh, you know, I gotta tell you,

423
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:35,939
when I first heard that
Stevie was hitching her wagon

424
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:37,374
to your cart,

425
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:38,753
the first thing that
came into my mind was,

426
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:40,041
whoooa, Nelly!

427
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:42,407
That horse is in big trouble.

428
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,348
A convoluted metaphor, but um...

429
00:17:44,382 --> 00:17:45,893
But I've gotta say,
you've proven me wrong,

430
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:48,440
I mean, obviously, you're
doing something right here.

431
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:52,089
Yeah, well, once again,

432
00:17:52,123 --> 00:17:53,490
thanks for coming by, Roland.

433
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:55,259
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Johnny, look.

434
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:56,660
I know it makes you uncomfortable

435
00:17:56,694 --> 00:17:59,815
when somebody gets real... with you,

436
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,910
but could we just have one
minute when I compliment you,

437
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:04,268
and you don't go all,

438
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:05,769
"Ooh Roland, my generation,

439
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:07,738
we don't talk about our feelings,

440
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:10,407
we keep 'em all rawrrr inside!"

441
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:12,209
Yeah well, that's not
it, but once again,

442
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:13,710
thanks for coming by.

443
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:15,112
Hey, one of you guys Ken?

444
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:16,875
Ken? No.

445
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,148
Hi.

446
00:18:18,183 --> 00:18:20,947
I'm Roland, Roland Schitt, mayor.

447
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,120
- Roland Schitt.
- Kitty.

448
00:18:23,154 --> 00:18:25,055
Kitty, how are you?

449
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,624
Are you enjoying your stay in our town?

450
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:30,127
- It's been really good, Mhmm.
- Oh...

451
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,182
Hmm.

452
00:18:31,214 --> 00:18:33,479
So Roland look, why don't
we head down to the office,

453
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:35,853
if we uh, wanna chat.

454
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,049
Who's Ken?

455
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,479
Well, Ken is probably her husband.

456
00:18:39,504 --> 00:18:41,971
Uh huh, and she doesn't
know what he looks like?

457
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:45,455
- Gentlemen.
- Uhhh...

458
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,458
Ah.

459
00:18:49,113 --> 00:18:50,714
- Excuse me.
- You betcha.

460
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:55,052
(Laughs) Oh, Johnny.

461
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:57,815
Well, I see why you've
had such a great week.

462
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:00,390
Okay, I don't know what you're implying,

463
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:02,526
But I don't like your tone.

464
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,927
Johnny, please.

465
00:19:03,962 --> 00:19:05,906
This little operation has
been on the council's radar

466
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,331
for quite a while now,

467
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:09,566
And I'm sorry, but that
was no Sunday school teacher

468
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:11,201
coming outta here!

469
00:19:11,236 --> 00:19:13,170
Okay look, this whole
thing was a mistake.

470
00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:14,605
This whole thing!

471
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:15,973
But I'm working on it,

472
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:17,975
I'm working to shut it down, quickly.

473
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:19,807
Well, I'm really happy to hear that,

474
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:21,555
because I would hate to have
to assert my mayoral authority

475
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:23,046
in a situation like this, yes?

476
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:26,083
Yeah, and nobody wants to
avoid that more than me.

477
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:27,658
Good, okay.

478
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:29,253
Well, you know what, I'm
glad I helped you fix your uh,

479
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:30,955
broken moral compass.

480
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,111
Well, there's nothing wrong
with my moral compass, but...

481
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:34,535
All right, well, why
don't we tell Kitty that?

482
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,927
(Snickers)

483
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:39,394
(Laughs)

484
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:42,158
Ah, I'd love to see that!

485
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,915
So, I was thinking for the chorus...

486
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,236
- Yeah?
- We could sway,

487
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:48,195
like we're actually
islands in the stream.

488
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,750
Oh yeah, that's good.

489
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:51,447
Hi, I'm here!

490
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:54,336
Moira, what about your big movie?

491
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,105
Oh that, they're still hounding me,

492
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:59,408
but... I took a moment to stop and think

493
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:01,877
about what is really important in life,

494
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:05,549
and while the Bosnian
Riviera is a majestic locale,

495
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:09,594
it can't hold a candle
to singing... with you

496
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:11,754
wonderful working women here,

497
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:13,877
in our makeshift rehearsal studio.

498
00:20:13,902 --> 00:20:15,369
Well, I'm flattered,

499
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:18,961
but Twyla's been working
on your part for the duet,

500
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:20,729
and I really don't
think that that would be

501
00:20:20,764 --> 00:20:22,998
in the spirit of things
to take that from her.

502
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:25,330
But the song was my idea, Jocelyn.

503
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:28,454
John and I made David to that song,

504
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:30,048
in Pusitano.

505
00:20:30,073 --> 00:20:32,775
Hey, why don't we just
show you how we're doing,

506
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:35,778
and you can offer up
some professional advice,

507
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:36,924
for now.

508
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:39,042
Okay.

509
00:20:42,055 --> 00:20:44,268
(Clears throat)

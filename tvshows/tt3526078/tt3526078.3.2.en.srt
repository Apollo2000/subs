1
00:00:02,978 --> 00:00:05,101
- Oh my God!
- Ugh!

2
00:00:05,718 --> 00:00:07,372
Jeez, I'm not out the door yet!

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,741
Hey, hey, David, isn't that your friend?

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,343
Oh, I didn't recognize him clothed.

5
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:15,375
Yeah, I don't know what he's doing here.

6
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,152
You sure, David, 'cause
I've got a pretty good idea.

7
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,586
Alexis, don't be crass.

8
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,188
David, is he here to s...

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,057
Oh my God, I literally told him

10
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,632
to never come back here
while you people were home.

11
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,361
So, I don't...

12
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:30,392
Um...

13
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,598
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,400
Well, I was just in
the neighborhood. so...

15
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:35,768
I just thought after last week,

16
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,170
we decided to avoid the motel.

17
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,738
Like, generally speaking.

18
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,540
David, what should we do?

19
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,941
Should we be walking ahead,

20
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:43,320
how far ahead should we be walking?

21
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:44,721
I'm just gonna walk,

22
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,456
'cause I don't even care
what's going on right now.

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,614
Keep walking, okay?! Walk, walk, walk!

24
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,950
Um... what's going on?

25
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,148
Oh...

26
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,561
Okay, um, so you weren't
here for me today.

27
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:02,962
Okay.

28
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:05,331
Well, it's just a casual hang,

29
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:06,977
- you know, we talked about it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,601
That's totally fine, I'm just...

31
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,846
I'm tasting metal, for some reason.

32
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,237
Um...

33
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,239
Oh God, David, this is so awkward!

34
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,460
What? What's happening?

35
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:16,491
Well, I don't think
Jake is here to see David.

36
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:19,221
We can hear you. Very clearly.

37
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,646
Oh.

38
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,015
Okay, He's early.

39
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,416
- I didn't know...
- No! No, no.

40
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,452
- Okay, sorry.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry.

41
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:27,854
Uh...

42
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:30,733
- Have fun, you two.
- Oh John, no!

43
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,425
- Oh, right.
- Don't worry, David,

44
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,194
I've been in this situation
like, the most times,

45
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,073
except I'm always the girl
getting into the truck.

46
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,132
The least they could
do is offer us a ride!

47
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,967
Okay, let's move please, people!

48
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:46,085

49
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,712
All set, Mr. Rose?

50
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:55,515
Yes, Twyla, I think I'll have the eggs,

51
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,357
and brown toast, over easy,

52
00:01:57,382 --> 00:01:59,085
The eggs, not the toast.

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,486
Comin' right up.

54
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,356
And I think I might ask for a...

55
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,124
Oh my God!

56
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:07,668
What happened?

57
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:09,505
Well, I went whitewater rafting,

58
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,065
Oh no, well, that'll do it, I mean...

59
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,666
Anyway, it's fine now.

60
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,802
Yesterday it was this stabbing pain,

61
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:19,138
but today it's more like
a really intense throbbing.

62
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,907
Well, it's not urgent, not urgent.

63
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,009
I don't need coffee with breakfast, so.

64
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,487
I'll grab it right after I clear these.

65
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,313
Well, if it's not too much trouble?

66
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,748
Can I help you with those?

67
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,116
Oh, no, no.

68
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,617
Oh, you know, I can help,

69
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,386
I can help with that, Twyla.

70
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,022
No, no, they say it's better
to work through the pain.

71
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,457
- Really.
- Oh well, there you go.

72
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,851
If those are the doctor's orders...

73
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,298
No, I mean, I can help, Twyla.

74
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,999
I do have a bad back,

75
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,001
But I-I can certainly uh...

76
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,403
- help out here.
- Oh!

77
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,273
Uh, who picked through my cake,

78
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,741
and only left the icing?

79
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,276
Who eats the icing?!

80
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,145
What kind of barnyard
were you raised in,

81
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,247
where you just eat someone else's food?!

82
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,615
So you can share a boyfriend,

83
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,027
but you can't share a piece of cake?

84
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,418
I'm not sharing a boyfriend,

85
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,487
Stevie and I are both dating Jake,

86
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,921
at the same time,

87
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,857
like sexually evolved human beings.

88
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,259
Oh, okay, because in my
experience with throuples...

89
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,128
We're not a "throuple!"

90
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,174
When it comes to three people, David,

91
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,617
there's always a favorite.

92
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,801
It's just like how Mom likes you more.

93
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,646
That's not true, and
please don't include Mom

94
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,139
in an analogy about my
relationship, thank you!

95
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,040
David, lunch today?

96
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,809
- No.
- Oh, okay.

97
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,570
Well, I'll dine alone.

98
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:33,661
See?!

99
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:35,992
See what?

100
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:40,054
Alexis seems to think you like me more.

101
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,356
Alexis, don't be ridiculous!

102
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,790
This is exactly the kind of paranoia

103
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,527
that makes me wary of
spending time with you.

104
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,529
I was sitting right here,

105
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,864
and you chose to eat lunch alone.

106
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,232
That is simply not true!

107
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,843
I didn't see you.

108
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,969
At first.

109
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,341
Alexis, I would be
absolutely glee-ridden

110
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,742
if you would have lunch with me.

111
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,398
Today.

112
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,915
No, no, no, no, no. I wasn't actually...

113
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,601
You'll meet me at the cafe
for their one o'clock sitting.

114
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,937
- Something wrong?
- No!

115
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,031
I should go.

116
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,967
Don't wanna set a bad example

117
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,609
for the rest of the motel staff.

118
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:31,648
I thought you were the
only one that worked there.

119
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,640
Yeah, that's another good reason to go.

120
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,242
All right, well, I'll drive you.

121
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,640
Mm, I think I'll walk.

122
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:40,813
I'm trying very hard not to repeat

123
00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:41,906
what happened last night.

124
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:44,850
Hmm, and here I am
trying very hard to repeat

125
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,285
what happened last night.

126
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,956
I meant you picking me up.

127
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,325
And David and his family.

128
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,617
Ohhh!

129
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,639
Yeah, yeah.

130
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:57,648
Could've timed that one better.

131
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,133
Yeah. Well, I guess
that's bound to happen

132
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:04,937
sooner or later in this
sort of situation, right?

133
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,574
I'm sensing that this whole setup

134
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,509
is becoming a bit of
a problem for David.

135
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,851
Yeah, he's just very fragile.

136
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,282
- He's like a snowflake.
- Yeah.

137
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,586
I just think maybe it's
time he and I have a chat.

138
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,588
Oh! No! That's not...

139
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,000
I mean, that's not what I was implying!

140
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,424
No, no, not at all. This is a...

141
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,026
This is a good idea.

142
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,570
For him and for us.

143
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,831
Uhhh...

144
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:34,834
Here we go, Twyla.

145
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:38,847
Table Five, a Caprese
salad, and a ginger ale.

146
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,307
Thank you, Mr. Rose, I
really appreciate this.

147
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,664
Oh!

148
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,677
Yeah, it looks like the morning rush

149
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,612
is finally dying down.

150
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,814
Maybe I can get the kitchen to whip up

151
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,375
a fresh batch of eggs for us volunteers.

152
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,055
Uh, Twyla, honey, whenever you're ready.

153
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,556
- I'll be right there!
- Okay.

154
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,002
Would you please pass me my crutch?

155
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,826
- Not a problem.
- Unless...

156
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,361
No, it's right here.

157
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,864
No, I was gonna say
unless you could possibly

158
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,265
take their order?

159
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,301
I just need to cash out Table Three.

160
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,359
Sure, no, I can...

161
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:12,638
I can do that.

162
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,117
You know, it's funny,
I said eggs, but uh...

163
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,108
I'm gonna be ready for lunch soon.

164
00:06:20,976 --> 00:06:22,715
No, I hear your concern,

165
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,867
it's just apparently what geese do.

166
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,952
No, it's not the town's problem,

167
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,437
You're just going to have
to watch where you step.

168
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,467
I don't want to hear
the... I don't want...

169
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,858
No, I don't wanna hear that!

170
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,330
Okay, I'm gonna take an early lunch.

171
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:40,199
Twyla's got a broken foot,
so lunch could take a while.

172
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,035
- You coming?
- Yes, let me just get...

173
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,339
Oh wait, I don't think I can.

174
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:49,442
Okay, I didn't think it'd be
such a tough decision, so...

175
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,742
No, Ronnie!

176
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:54,014
I would love nothing more
than to lunch with you today,

177
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,116
but I believe I'm lunching with Alexis.

178
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,919
It's kind of a mother daughter thing.

179
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,021
Oh, a little bonding time.

180
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,914
Yes, and what's so wrong with that?!

181
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,226
I don't know, is there
something wrong with that?

182
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,761
Well, just because my daughter and I

183
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,597
don't do that sort of thing
doesn't mean it's impossible!

184
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,499
And I'm sure you'll
have a really good time.

185
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,935
Yes, we will! We will!

186
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,225
Once I break the ice with a
provocative question or two.

187
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,139
Sure.

188
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,718
And then there's the
banter about the food,

189
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,009
that always eats up
some time, doesn't it?

190
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,078
As long as you don't over think it.

191
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,460
Oh, no. Ronnie!

192
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,058
If you're still there when we arrive,

193
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:32,885
might we... perhaps push
our tables together?

194
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,420
Yeah, perhaps.

195
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,421
Hey!

196
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:51,580
Um, you don't need me to work
through lunch today, do you?

197
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,982
Would that be to make up for the work

198
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,617
you were supposed to
be doing this morning?

199
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,876
I took one tiny break
to watch two episodes

200
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,881
of "Scandal" with Mrs. McCreary,

201
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:00,980
while she waited for her dog!

202
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,581
Why do you wanna work through lunch?

203
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:06,006
Um no, I just thought you might need me,

204
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:08,721
and um, I wanted to see
if I needed to cancel

205
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,190
this lunch that I have
at the cafe with my mom.

206
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,392
No need, have lunch with your mom.

207
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:14,927
Okay, cool.

208
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,029
Um, I totally don't mind though,

209
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,726
if you want me to stay.

210
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,367
Is everything okay with your mom?

211
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,502
Absolutely! Why?

212
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:24,914
Well, it's just you've offered to work

213
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,505
through lunch three times now,

214
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,708
and... most days I can barely get
you to come back after lunch.

215
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,110
Thank you, Ted.

216
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,579
No, everything's fine, it's just...

217
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,649
we don't spend a lot of time
together just the two of us,

218
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,312
which is why it's totally
easy to just rain-check.

219
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,287
Isn't that all the more reason to go?

220
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,665
I mean, I try to have lunch with my mom

221
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,323
at least once a week.

222
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,258
And sometimes lunch
will turn into dinner,

223
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,994
because we get carried
away chatting, and...

224
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,496
For sure, for sure.

225
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,804
Okay, well I guess lunch is free, then.

226
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,934
So I guess I will see you tomorrow.

227
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,537
Oh, well, there's still work to be done,

228
00:08:57,562 --> 00:08:59,171
so probably best if you...

229
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,273
come back after lunch.

230
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,676
Okay, but nothing during lunch, though.

231
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,077
Maybe?

232
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,531
Tell your mom I say hi.

233
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,782
Okay... thanks.

234
00:09:12,156 --> 00:09:13,725
Well, I guess I was a bit premature

235
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,588
thinking the morning rush was over.

236
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,022
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

237
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,724
Table five, seven and eight,

238
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,159
and the big group at twelve,

239
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,027
separate cheques, if you can.

240
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,529
Thank you, Mr. Rose.

241
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,898
And I've got a steak sandwich
here with your name on it.

242
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,299
Oh, you shouldn't have!

243
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,701
Just one thing before you start...

244
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,636
Yeah, steak sauce, I
know, you read my mind.

245
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,048
Actually, I was gonna
ask if you could take this

246
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,672
to table four.

247
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,274
Oh! Yes, yes, I can.

248
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,176
And then I'll be back for that sandwich,

249
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,844
avec sauce.

250
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,014
Here you go.

251
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,782
I didn't order this, I ordered the fish.

252
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,615
That's mine, the full combo?

253
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,396
I wanted to order the fish.

254
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,787
Well, you can order the fish.

255
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,422
He told me not to, he said it was off.

256
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,824
The fish is off?!

257
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,059
No, no, the fish is fine,
it's just uh, you know,

258
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,494
it was a bit fishy.

259
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,039
You know what, I'll just order

260
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,031
the full combo instead.

261
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,300
Okay, but just to be clear,

262
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,836
the combo is a cup of soup,

263
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,405
- and a half a sandwich.
- Then what is that?

264
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,806
It's the full combo.

265
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,109
- There is no full combo.
- He said there was.

266
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,944
Well, not-not in those words.

267
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,846
No, I said we'll see what we can do.

268
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,427
Well, what's this, then?

269
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,050
That's just a soup and a sandwich.

270
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,419
But there is a deal, right?

271
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,568
No.

272
00:10:22,935 --> 00:10:25,082
- You said it was a combo.
- No, no,

273
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:28,561
I said it was like an
evolution of a combo.

274
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:29,962
But there's no deal?!

275
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,964
Well, there is a deal on the combo,

276
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,600
which is a cup of soup,

277
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,235
and a half a sandwich.

278
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,740
So what's this gonna cost me?

279
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,772
Well, I-I think we can uh,

280
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,274
charge you for two uh, half combos.

281
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,642
There is no half combo!

282
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,312
It's just a cup of soup,
and a half a sandwich!

283
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,914
Johnny, if I get the
soup with the brisket,

284
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,517
is that then the full combo?

285
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:55,020
- Mr. Rose?
- Yeah, I'll fix it, uh, Twyla.

286
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,889
All right, just soup, and a sandwich.

287
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:21,412
- Hey!
- Hello!

288
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:23,438
Hey.

289
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:26,339
Hey.

290
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:28,031
I'm so glad we're doing this.

291
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:29,733
Me too!

292
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,135
When your father comes over,

293
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:33,137
just act like everything's normal.

294
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:35,806
Is there something not
normal about us being here?

295
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,818
It's not normal for your
father to be waiting tables

296
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:39,977
at a rural sandwich counter.

297
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,876
Eww! What's happening?

298
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:43,578
He thinks he's working.

299
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:44,644
Just play along.

300
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:46,391
Well, can I get you ladies started

301
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:49,217
with anything that is not a combo?

302
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,953
Um, I will have a mixed green salad,

303
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:53,621
and some chicken.

304
00:11:53,656 --> 00:11:56,024
Me too, something in common already.

305
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:57,629
Salads, good. Simple.

306
00:11:57,654 --> 00:12:00,322
And I will get the dressing
on the side, please.

307
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:01,757
You'll get your dressing on the salad,

308
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:03,416
like everyone else.

309
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:09,997
Hmm!

310
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:14,342
Hmm.

311
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:25,720
So... huh, this is new.

312
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:28,590
Well, a lot more people are
seeing my body these days,

313
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:30,158
so I just thought I would...

314
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:31,693
What's going on?

315
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:34,062
I just wanted to check in, you know,

316
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,564
after that whole thing last night.

317
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:37,932
Was it a whole thing?

318
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,734
I mean, I went to dinner with my family,

319
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:41,803
and you had a...

320
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:44,973
romantic rendezvous with
someone that we're both seeing.

321
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:46,864
- So...
- Yeah.

322
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:49,771
- That.
- Well, I'm fine with it.

323
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,543
Me too.

324
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,741
I just wanna make sure
that we're still fine,

325
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:56,967
you know, down the line.

326
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,621
Because what if things get complicated?

327
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,556
What would make things complicated?

328
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,991
Nothing!

329
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,503
But the last thing
we want is a situation

330
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:06,961
where one person is breaking
up with another person,

331
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:08,596
and that person is hurt,

332
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:10,108
because things have gotten complicated!

333
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:11,776
Okay, I'm starting to
feel like I'm trapped

334
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,401
in an Avril Lavigne lyric here.

335
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:15,904
And while I not-so-secretly love Avril,

336
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:17,816
and have paid very close
attention to her battle

337
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,207
with Lyme disease,

338
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:20,808
um, I don't know why we're...

339
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,243
Okay.

340
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:25,146
If you knew somebody was planning

341
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,746
on breaking up with you,

342
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:29,506
wouldn't you wanna be the one
to break up with him first?

343
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:34,422
Okay, if you think he's
going to break up with you

344
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:36,724
and you wanna be the first one to do it,

345
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,626
I say, be the first one to do it.

346
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:39,994
Okay, I'm doing this wrong.

347
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:41,729
I need to be more direct.

348
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:43,998
Yes, by just telling him how you feel.

349
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,900
I think it'll benefit everyone.

350
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:48,066
- I meant you!
- Me?

351
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:50,405
I'm trying to warn you...

352
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:52,050
That you are going to be
ending things with him.

353
00:13:52,074 --> 00:13:54,511
And I appreciate that, but
message has been delivered.

354
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,312
- Oh my God.
- Loud and clear.

355
00:13:57,346 --> 00:13:58,680
Uh...

356
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,048
Oh.

357
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:03,685
Okay, it's Jake, so um...

358
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,119
Oh, okay.

359
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:08,122
Don't worry, I'm gonna let you tell him.

360
00:14:09,107 --> 00:14:11,496
- Okay.
- Hello?

361
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:14,696
Yeah, no, I was just um...

362
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,297
I was just doing squats, actually.

363
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:17,732
Ugh!

364
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,407
Mmm!

365
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:29,477
Um, I love having salad for lunch.

366
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:31,012
It's just, it's not heavy.

367
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:34,201
No, well, a heavy salad
might as well be a casserole.

368
00:14:34,226 --> 00:14:36,365
Mhmm...

369
00:14:38,786 --> 00:14:40,287
So, how are...

370
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:44,396
working at the animal hos-

371
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:47,623
Uh, how is working at
the animal hospital?

372
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:50,834
- Fine.
- That's marvelous.

373
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:53,872
And...

374
00:14:55,154 --> 00:14:57,372
uh, your daily exercise routine...

375
00:14:57,406 --> 00:14:58,706
What are you looking at?

376
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:00,638
- It's-well, it's a
napkin. - Let me see this.

377
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,277
You had to prepare questions?!

378
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:05,780
I wouldn't categorize
them as questions exactly.

379
00:15:05,814 --> 00:15:07,148
"What's your favorite color?"

380
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:09,283
- Black.
- That's one of the questions!

381
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:10,652
It's right after,

382
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:12,920
"how is your job at
the animal hospital?"

383
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,289
Is it a crime, Alexis,

384
00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:16,768
that I had so many queries
for you that I wrote them down

385
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,277
in anticipation of forgetting them?

386
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:21,006
Well, you wouldn't need
these if you were having lunch

387
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,665
- with David.
- Oh, Alexis, please.

388
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,683
I wasn't even sure you'd show up.

389
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,777
Why wouldn't I show up?

390
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,304
You've never wanted to
spend time alone with me.

391
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:33,043
There, I said it.

392
00:15:34,462 --> 00:15:36,063
You never asked.

393
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:38,713
Bordeaux?! The trip I
planned for the two of us?

394
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:40,548
That was a wine tasting tour,

395
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:42,316
and I was seven years old!

396
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:43,751
You could've used the spittoon,

397
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:45,316
That's what the other children did.

398
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:47,433
But you weren't interested.

399
00:15:47,786 --> 00:15:50,120
It was as if you didn't
want to be seen with me.

400
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:53,366
Well, did you ever wonder why?

401
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:54,929
To revel in my misery?

402
00:15:54,963 --> 00:15:57,527
No, it's because you were
always being recognized.

403
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,500
- Yes...
- No! Not now.

404
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:01,964
Like... before.

405
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:04,739
Didn't you enjoy the warm glow

406
00:16:04,773 --> 00:16:07,008
that Mummy's spotlight cast upon you?

407
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,943
- No!
- Alexis!

408
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:10,978
If I'd known you didn't
like the attention,

409
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,424
I would've chosen to be alone with you,

410
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:15,839
and not out in public,
among the throngs of fans.

411
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:18,252
I don't remember throngs.

412
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:22,845
I never meant for you to think that I...

413
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:25,261
didn't wanna spend any time with you.

414
00:16:26,014 --> 00:16:27,166
Well...

415
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:32,721
I hope it's not too late
to make up for lost time.

416
00:16:36,004 --> 00:16:37,338
Okay.

417
00:16:37,987 --> 00:16:40,141
What is your favorite season?

418
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,064
Awards.

419
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:03,986
Uh, what are you doing here?

420
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,767
I'm meeting Jake.

421
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,235
To break up with him?

422
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:15,152
No, I thought you spoke
to him on the phone before?

423
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:17,797
I did, he invited me here for dinner.

424
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,014
Uh...

425
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:23,117
- Hi!
- Sorry I'm late, guys.

426
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:25,119
Oh, you both look amazing.

427
00:17:25,154 --> 00:17:26,521
Great. Muah!

428
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:27,922
- Oh. Hi...
- Hey. Muah!

429
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:28,946
- Mhmm.
- Sit, please.

430
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:29,555
Oh, okay.

431
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,692
No, I think there's
been a mix-up here.

432
00:17:31,727 --> 00:17:33,828
I don't think I should be here for this.

433
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:35,422
Oh, no, no,

434
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:36,782
I think it's very important
that you're here for this.

435
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,625
Okay, here for what?

436
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:41,021
Well, good evening.

437
00:17:41,046 --> 00:17:42,532
David, Stevie.

438
00:17:42,557 --> 00:17:44,238
- Mr. Rose.
- Hello again.

439
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:47,475
I take it we'll be dining
together as a group tonight?

440
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:49,110
Or will you be taking turns?

441
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:51,379
Um, first of all, what
are you doing here?!

442
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:53,875
And second, we're gonna need a minute.

443
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:56,684
- So...
- Yeah, sure, take your time.

444
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:00,351
Okay.

445
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:04,058
David, may I?

446
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:05,493
Yeah.

447
00:18:06,157 --> 00:18:08,273
I know this hasn't
been easy on you lately,

448
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:10,097
and that doesn't make me feel good.

449
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,586
And I know Stevie's been
feeling it a little bit, too.

450
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:14,114
Has she?

451
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:16,214
That's why I think there's
only one thing for me to do.

452
00:18:16,238 --> 00:18:17,508
Oh, I should go.

453
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:19,767
- No. No.
- Okay...

454
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:25,016
I think we all need
to be in this together.

455
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,714
Now, you've been with each other,

456
00:18:26,748 --> 00:18:28,477
and you've both been with me.

457
00:18:29,006 --> 00:18:30,906
Let's all be...

458
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:33,522
with us.

459
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:38,274
Let's all be with us?

460
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:39,666
All of us.

461
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,118
Together.

462
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,198
- Mm, 'Kay.
- Yeah...

463
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:46,601
I don't think that's gonna work.

464
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:48,536
Stevie, we talked about this.

465
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,638
You talked about this?!

466
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,180
You said you didn't want
to make things complicated!

467
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:55,688
Yeah, that's why I
invited you both here.

468
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:00,133
Wow, okay.

469
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:02,266
Hmm, I think maybe I...

470
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:04,180
misread the situation here.

471
00:19:04,205 --> 00:19:06,074
Yeah, I think that's a
pretty accurate realization.

472
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:06,697
Uh huh!

473
00:19:06,722 --> 00:19:07,750
Might've done.

474
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:09,109
Okay.

475
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:11,626
Okay, maybe it's best we all just...

476
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,694
take a step back from this.

477
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:15,830
- Okay.
- Yeah, maybe that's...

478
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,336
that's the best thing to do.

479
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,167
- Mhmm.
- Well...

480
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:23,504
This one's for you, Muah!

481
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,415
- And you.
- Oh! I get one.

482
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,107
- Mhmm, Muah!
- Okay.

483
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,930
All right, I'll see 'ya.

484
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:31,288
Ah!

485
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,060
To be clear,

486
00:19:40,422 --> 00:19:42,423
you were going to go on a date with him,

487
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:45,063
knowing that he had
just broken up with me?

488
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:47,508
No I wasn't.

489
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,946
Uh, you showed up for the date.

490
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:52,806
No I didn't.

491
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,188
You're literally here in the restaurant!

492
00:19:57,339 --> 00:19:58,706
Because I was gonna tell him

493
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,641
that I was breaking up with him.

494
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,843
Ohhh, okay.

495
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:08,711
Uh, yeah, fine.

496
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:11,729
But if it makes you feel any better,

497
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,187
nobody hates me more than me.

498
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:14,922
Generally speaking.

499
00:20:14,957 --> 00:20:17,305
Fair enough, I would've
done the same thing.

500
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,890
There you go Mr Rose.

501
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:21,282
This is your share of the tips.

502
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:23,602
Oh Twyla, I can't take any money.

503
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:25,394
I insist, you earned it.

504
00:20:25,587 --> 00:20:28,065
Well, I have to admit,

505
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,188
I haven't worked this
hard in a long time.

506
00:20:31,226 --> 00:20:32,555
I'm glad to hear it.

507
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:37,365
Although the things
some of these customers

508
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:38,733
can put you through!

509
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:40,601
Oh, I know.

510
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:43,344
Joking when you're way too busy,

511
00:20:44,115 --> 00:20:46,532
trying to tell you how
they want their food cooked.

512
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:49,542
I've experienced a bit of that myself.

513
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:58,063
Yeah, you know, I think maybe um...

514
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:00,288
you should keep my share of the tips.

515
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:02,990
That's not necessary, Mr. Rose.

516
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:06,047
No, just think of it as
a little reparation pay.

517
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:08,807
Well, that doesn't
even begin to cover it!

518
00:21:13,696 --> 00:21:18,265

To not following

520
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:22,810
too closely in her footsteps.

521
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,515
We're drinking to me

522
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,083
not becoming an alcoholic.

523
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,251
Mhm.

524
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,079
Off to a good start.

David: Why are you yelling?
I'm right here.

31
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:13,628
Your community service papers.

32
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:16,236
As our only delinquent, I hope
it's not asking too much.

33
00:01:16,237 --> 00:01:17,365
I still have to do that?

34
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:19,334
Generally, that's how it works, honey.

35
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:22,003
When you break the law, you've
gotta serve your sentence.

36

Well, it was one DUI.

37

No, there's still a little bit
that needs to be filled in.

Um... all that's missing
is my middle name.

43

Then fill it in please.

44
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:43,556
Do I have to do that?

45
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:47,527
Why must you be so constantly irksome?

46
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:50,396
Do you not know my middle name?

47
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:53,900
Of course I do. I blessed you with it.

48
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:57,170
Okay, so um... then what
name should I put down then?

49
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:58,972
Alexis, do as your mother says, please.

50

We have so many disasters
bombarding us right now, my dear,

55
00:02:13,554 --> 00:02:15,421
the middle name of an ungrateful child

56
00:02:15,422 --> 00:02:17,724
is hardly a priority.

David: Wait. Alexis has a middle name?

58
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:21,461
Why is this the first
time hearing of this?

59

Do... do I have a middle name?

Moira: Have we failed them, John?
I'm worried about our children.

64
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:37,844
Are we terrible parents?

65
00:02:37,845 --> 00:02:41,247
Terrible parents?!

66
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:43,383
We sent them to the
best boarding schools,

67
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:46,953
we hired the best nannies...
We did everything right.

68
00:02:48,822 --> 00:02:50,857
I mean, they're not overly
affectionate with us

69
00:02:50,858 --> 00:02:53,660
and, uh, there's a lot more
disrespect than I'd like,

70
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:55,370
but, uh, no, we're good parents.

71
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:57,683
But who are they?

72
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:01,801
Well, it might be nice to get
to know them better, I suppose.

73
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:04,137
Wouldn't it, John?

74
00:03:04,138 --> 00:03:06,105
But who has time amidst all this chaos?

75
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:08,294
Mm. I get it.

Alexis: Um... it's good.

00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:22,188
Yeah, lots of doors open
up for pretty people.

81
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:26,125
Mm-hmm, clearly, as I register
for community service.

82
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:27,727
So what'd you do?

83
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:32,198
Um... I drove into the Prada
Store on Rodeo Drive.

84
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,666
In fairness, it did look a lot like,

85
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,401
um, the entrance to a parking garage.

86
00:03:35,402 --> 00:03:36,903
Uh-huh.

87
00:03:36,904 --> 00:03:38,438
And I was high at the time.

88
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,373
Are you high right now?

89
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:42,709
No, I'm not.

90
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,011
Well, you might wanna be,

91
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:47,880
'cause this isn't exactly thrilling work.

92
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:50,274
And you won't be gettin' any
chit chat from your buddy.

(Loud clunk) Here's your garbage stick.

97
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:03,096
You use it to pick up garbage.

98
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:05,264
And here...

99
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:07,200
Oh no, I'm fine.

100
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:09,168
Thank you, that's very sweet.

101
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:11,760
Ronnie: This isn't say yes
to the dress, princess.

102

Stevie: I'm still trying to figure out

107
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:28,321
why you'd own more than
one piece of clothing

108
00:04:28,322 --> 00:04:30,056
you can't put in a washing machine.

109
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:32,122
You try putting a cashmere
sweater in the washing machine.

110
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:33,459
It'll bite your wrist.

111
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,561
That's a problem I'd like to have.

112
00:04:37,598 --> 00:04:38,931
Are these all your clothes?

Yeah.

114
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:43,636
What's this, then?

115
00:04:43,637 --> 00:04:46,372
That's a sweater.

116
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,508
It's one chromosome away
from a crocheted blanket.

117
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:51,043
What?

118
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:53,546
It's... just your clothes,
they're all kind of funky.

119
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:55,548
Funky?

120
00:04:55,549 --> 00:04:57,450
Yeah. Funky.

121
00:04:57,451 --> 00:04:59,155
Yeah, no, no, no.
I'm just trying to figure out...

122
00:04:59,156 --> 00:05:00,953
What about this...
What about this is funky?

123
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:03,022
I'm just having a hard time understanding.

124
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:07,203
It's just, you know,
like funky. Different.

125
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:09,362
Yeah, funky is a neon t-shirt

126
00:05:09,363 --> 00:05:10,952
you buy at an airport gift shop,

127
00:05:10,953 --> 00:05:12,438
next to a bejeweled iPhone case.

128
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:16,630
This... this... is luxury.

129
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,738
There's a lot of stuff here.

130
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:21,674
Have you ever considered
selling some of this.

131
00:05:21,675 --> 00:05:24,076
These are my things.

132
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:25,832
I've hand-selected each of these things;

133
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,652
they mean a lot to me.

134
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,633
How much do you think
I can get for this?

135
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:32,785
(Birds chirp)

136
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:37,056
<i>Alexis: So you got busted
for selling drugs?</i>

137
00:05:37,057 --> 00:05:39,125
Like hard drugs? Like...

138
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:43,563
Did you wear a Hazmat suit and...
work in a trailer?

139
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:46,165
No. It was just weed
and mushrooms, uppers.

140
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,100
Mostly to truckers and
my high school teachers.

141
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:51,471
Mm-hmm. It's actually
pretty clean around here,

142
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:55,441
which is shocking considering
the state of our motel room.

143
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:58,311
Speaking of unfit homes,
why do you live in a barn?

144
00:05:58,312 --> 00:06:00,179
What's wrong with living in a barn?

145
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,148
Mm... nothing, if you're a goat.

146

147

Mutt: Well, it serves its purpose.

00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:07,953
It seems to... With the ladies.

149
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,457
That's just a joke.

150
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,793
I'm sorry for walking in on
you and Twyla the other day.

151
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:15,995
Mutt: No, it's cool.

152
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:17,964
Alexis: So how long have
you two been together-

153
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:20,433
Mutt: So, listen, I gotta
take off for a bit.

154
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:22,802
I got this thing I gotta do.
Can you cover for me?

155
00:06:22,803 --> 00:06:24,649
- Alexis: Um... I mean...
- Mutt: Cool.

156
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,757
- Alexis: Yeah.
- Mutt: Thanks. Sorry.

157
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:32,586
Excuse me! What am I
supposed to keep doing here?

158
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:35,681
I feel like we should break
these into categories.

159
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:40,887
Um... fit, fabric,

160
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:43,823
and nationality.

161
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:45,925
Stevie: Or we could do this.

162
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:47,326
<i>David: I... um...</i>

163
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:49,161
- Stevie: Keep or sell?
- David: Well, those are-

164
00:06:49,162 --> 00:06:50,429
- Stevie: Keep or sell.
- David: Uh...

165
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,599
- Stevie: Just keep or sell.
- David: Sell. Sell them.

166
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,501
I got these at a showroom in Paris.

167
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,456
Stevie: I got these on
clearance rack at Target.

168
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,338
- David: $850.
- Stevie: 850 what?

169
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:01,007
- David: Eight hundred-
- Stevie: Dollars?!

170
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:02,975
- David: $850 dollars.
- Stevie: $850 dollars?

171
00:07:02,976 --> 00:07:05,945
These are a collector's. There's a woman
in Paris that makes them by hand, so...

172
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:08,581
My car's worth less than your pants.

173
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:11,250
Well, I've seen your car and
that makes sense to me.

174
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:12,718
(Clears throat)

175
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:14,186
Stevie: Okay then. Right.

176
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:18,821
We'll try to get $850
dollars for your pants.

177
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:21,761
Keep or sell?

178
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:23,763
I don't know.

179
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:27,633
(Bushes rustle, frustrated
grunts and groans)

180
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,303
(Cicadas drone, birds sing)

181
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:43,849
(Gasps)

182
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:48,120
Oh...

183
00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:53,893
(Door clicks open)

184
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:55,628
(Alexis grunts, running footsteps)

185
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:56,195
(Truck door bangs shut)

186
00:07:56,196 --> 00:07:59,031
(Music plays quietly)

187
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:02,363
You know, I think the reason
our kids are so casual with us

188
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:05,533
is because they think
of us as their friends.

189
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:08,036
Hmm, no.

190
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:11,305
Johnny: No, it's obvious.
It's obvious, Moira, right?

191
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:13,775
Because we're hip parents.

192
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:15,592
- Moira: Oh, John...
- Johnny: And that comes at a price.

193
00:08:15,593 --> 00:08:16,978
John, we're not hip.

194
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,480
I'm hipper than you but
in our childrens' eyes

195
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:22,583
we are the polar antonym of hip.

196
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:25,853
Well, somehow we've lost
touch with our kids.

197
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:27,655
We've become complete strangers.

198
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:30,258
Twyla: Hey! Have we decided?

199
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,493
Just coffee, please.

200
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:35,863
Johnny: Uh... Twyla, do you
get along with your parents?

201
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:37,331
<i>Twyla: I did.</i>

202
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:39,600
It's a little different now.

203
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:42,570
My mom has this thing where half the
time she thinks I'm her cousin Angela.

204
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:44,472
<i>And it's getting harder and harder</i>

205
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:47,455
to coordinate visitation
times with my dad in prison.

206
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,244
I'm sorry I asked.

207
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:52,680
Twyla: Oh, that's okay!
I'll get you your coffees.

208
00:08:52,681 --> 00:08:54,573
(Diners murmur quietly, cutlery clanks)

209
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:58,886
<i>(Cars rumble by the motel)</i>

210
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:00,300
<i>Johnny: Your mother and
I have been talking</i>

211
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:02,123
and we've come to the realization

212
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,358
that we've not been very good parents.

213
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:07,528
<i>Moira: Sadly, and most of the time,</i>

214
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:10,331
we have no interest in
what's going on with you.

215
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:12,433
Johnny: We have no idea what.
'Cause she means no idea.

216
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:13,901
<i>(Clears throat)</i>

217
00:09:13,902 --> 00:09:16,737
<i>We have lost touch as a family</i>

218
00:09:16,738 --> 00:09:18,873
and if we're gonna get through
this ordeal together,

219
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:22,376
we have got to get reacquainted.

220
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:26,080
Now, back at Rose Video,
we had management retreats

221
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:28,449
where we would play fun
team-building exercises-

222
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,017
David: You also had
company-wide spa days.

223
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:32,653
Why don't we try that?

224
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:36,057
Johnny: And one of the ice
breakers at these retreats

225
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:38,626
was a game that was always a hit.

226
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:40,061
And it was a game where somebody

227
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:41,729
would tell a lie about themselves,

228
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,165
and then a truth, and then another lie,

229
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,934
and everybody would have to
guess which one was the lie.

230
00:09:46,935 --> 00:09:49,003
No, Johnny, they had to guess
which one was the truth.

231
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:50,605
Mm... which one was the lie.

232
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:52,173
David: It's just-it's just one lie.

233
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,841
- Johnny: What did I say?
- Alexis: You said two lies.

234
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:54,942
- Johnny: Well, it is two lies.
- Alexis: No, it's-

235
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,277
David: No, the game is
"two truths and a lie."

236
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:57,512
- Johnny: It's truth.
- David: That's the game.

237
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,264
Johnny: So you've heard of it.
You've heard of it.

238
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,914
Alexis: Well, yeah, because babies
play that at their birthday parties.

239
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:02,049
Johnny: Okay, whatever.
It's a good game.

240
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,086
Okay? Now, here's how it goes.
I'll give you an example.

241
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:06,854
David: Why don't I start?
Um, I'm miserable,

242
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:09,223
drunk, and hate this game.

243
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:13,995
So... here's a hint...
Sadly, I'm not drunk.

244
00:10:13,996 --> 00:10:15,897
Okay, wrong attitude. That's
the wrong-right off the top!

245
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:18,266
Alexis: Okay, my turn, my turn, my turn.

246
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:21,235
Um... okay. My eyes are brown,

247
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:23,571
<i>I am basically sample-sized,</i>

248
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:28,075
and one time I escaped from a
Thai drug lord's car trunk

249
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:31,612
by bribing him with sex.

250
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:33,681
Right idea, honey, but you know what?

251
00:10:33,682 --> 00:10:35,795
It's gotta be more
challenging for everybody-

252
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:38,719
Her eyes are aqua.

253
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,855
Johnny: You did what?

254
00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:43,724
Alexis: (Laughs) I'm kidding!

255
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:46,327
I clearly would never
bribe anybody with sex.

256
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:47,695
Johnny: When were you in Thailand?!

257
00:10:47,696 --> 00:10:49,597
I told you that I was
on spring break.

258
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:51,966
Everyone can just calm down

259
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,801
because Aroon was a lovely gentleman

260
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:56,070
until he ran out of money.

261
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:57,905
How many people do you know

262
00:10:57,906 --> 00:11:00,208
that are currently in the prison system?

263
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,376
- Is it like twelve...?
- Um, I'm pretty sure just two.

264
00:11:02,377 --> 00:11:03,811
Johnny: All right, that's enough.
Good game.

265
00:11:03,812 --> 00:11:05,980
Good game, everybody!
Alexis you're grounded.

266
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:07,515
No! That was ten years ago,

267
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:09,445
and everybody does dumb
stuff in high school.

268
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:10,785
Johnny: You were 17?!

269
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:12,019
Did you know this?

270
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,956
As if. I don't do girl talk.

271
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:17,058
<i>Alexis: Okay, everybody
does dumb stuff everywhere.</i>

272
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:19,560
For example, I saw Mutt today -

273
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:21,095
the guy that lives in the barn -

274
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:24,432
making out... with the mayor's wife.

275
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,833
- Moira: What's-her-face?!
- Mm-hmm.

276
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,034
And the homeless kid?

277
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:31,472
Mm-hmm. Guys like that will bone anything.

278
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:35,142
- Well, not anything.
- Stop.

279
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:37,445
- 'Cause that would mean...
- Stop. Stop.

280
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,613
- That would include...
- Stop it.

281
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,677
- You. Which it doesn't.
- Don't.

282
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:41,678
Ew.

283
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:48,149
Johnny: You know, I remember when Alexis

284
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,785
was just a chubby-faced little girl

285
00:11:50,786 --> 00:11:53,821
racing around the house in
that banned babywalker,

286
00:11:53,822 --> 00:11:55,990
and now she's spending time...

287
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:58,292
(Inhales deeply) In a drug lord's trunk?!

288
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:02,163
Twyla: Oh, that is my
favourite Liam Neeson movie.

289
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:04,699
Moira: Johnny. Johnny,
look who's come in.

290
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,067
(Low hum of chatter)

291
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,004
Is it true?

292
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:13,241
Politician's neglected wife
sleeps with a ranch hand.

293
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:15,122
- Moira: I love it.
- Johnny: He's not a ranch hand.

294
00:12:15,123 --> 00:12:16,323
He's a vagrant in a barn.

295
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:21,015
- Moira: Hi there!
- Jocelyn: (Surprised) Moira.

296
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:23,418
- Johnny: Jocelyn. Hi.
- Jocelyn: Johnny, hi.

297
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:26,587
Moira: You look amazing. Utterly alive.

298
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:29,424
I don't feel it. My lower
back is completely shot.

299
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:31,292
Moira: Oh, dear. Why would that be?

300
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,061
(Blows out her breath) Age?

301
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:36,064
Even the slightest twitch
in bed throws it out.

302
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:37,899
Moira: Perhaps a new
position would help?

303
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,400
Would like to join us?

304
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:41,369
No, I ate already.

305
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,638
Couldn't put another thing in my mouth.

306
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,406
Johnny: (Chuckling) Well, that's...
(Clears his throat)

307
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:47,776
Moira: Okay. All right then.

308
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,797
David: Oh my God.

309
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:58,086
Stevie: They sell all kinds of stuff.

310
00:12:58,087 --> 00:12:59,787
- Stevie: Hey, Wayne.
- Wayne: Hey, Stevie.

311
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:01,923
Stevie: Um... so this
is my friend David.

312
00:13:01,924 --> 00:13:03,873
David: David Rose. What are
your consignment percentages?

313
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:05,426
(Garbage bag rustles)

314
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:08,029
Uh, this is a thrift shop.

315
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,530
Okay. Do you have sales representative?

316
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:10,798
Who will be pricing these items?

317
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,233
Wayne: Uh... me.

318
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:13,968
David: Okay.

319
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:15,736
(Bag rustles)

320
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:24,479
Is there a problem, Wayne?

321
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,247
Wayne: It's just...

322
00:13:26,248 --> 00:13:28,182
I can't really use any of this.

323
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,618
It's too, you know...

324
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:32,386
Funky?

325
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:33,988
Sure. Let's go with that.

326
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:36,891
David: Okay, let's take your
oily hands off my clothes.

327
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:38,449
Stevie: You sure you can't
take any of this stuff?

328
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,627
Some of this stuff's pretty good.

329
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:41,863
Wayne: Um... maybe we
can use the sneakers.

330
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:44,198
David: Maybe the sneakers?
This is French suede,

331
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,634
with a vulcanized-rubber instep, okay?

332
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:50,538
You've lost my trust
and my business, so...

333
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,206
We'll be leaving now.

334
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,308
- Stevie: Sorry.
- David: What is this place?

335
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:56,210
<i>What is this place?!</i>

336
00:14:00,415 --> 00:14:03,885
(Birds chirp, footsteps crunch)

337
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:07,054
- (Garbage pickers stab)
- Alexis: Ha!

338
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,456
(Garbage falls off) Ugh!

339
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:12,660
So... what happened to you yesterday?

340
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:15,530
What happened to me?

341
00:14:15,531 --> 00:14:17,598
Yeah, I came back you were gone.

342
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,368
Well, I had to do most
of the shift by myself.

343
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:22,603
So thank God I had my rape whistle.

344
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:25,773
Sorry. I had some stuff
I had to take care of.

345
00:14:25,774 --> 00:14:28,042
And did you get your
stuff taken care of?

346
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:31,279
Yeah, I guess.

347
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,015
Alexis: 'Cause it... It seems to me like

348
00:14:34,016 --> 00:14:39,153
you get your stuff taken
care of pretty regularly.

349
00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:41,589
By multiple people, if
you know what I mean.

350
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,192
Mutt: I don't.

351
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:46,360
Alexis: Look, I know you probably think

352
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:49,931
that you're this handsome man
around town who's like...

353
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:54,268
(Stabbing garbage) Handsome, mysterious...
And handsome and homeless-y

354
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,574
but you're better than that, you know?

355
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,107
Mutt: What?

356
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,475
Alexis: Like, I don't judge. Trust me.

357
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:05,537
I have been... I have been in the middle

358
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,140
of some very messy group scenarios

359
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,309
and I know how weird it can be, so...

360
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,112
Mutt: Are you okay?

361
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,080
Alexis: Yeah.

362
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,183
I'm just saying that your
secret is safe with me.

363
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,220
Wink.

364
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,427
Let me just say, I get it.

365
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,996
How much can one person take?

366
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,632
Johnny: Well, may-maybe this
is not our place, Moira.

367
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:36,902
Moira: And where does all
that pent up energy go?

368
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,637
Jocelyn: I should go.

369
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:41,306
- Roland: Hey...
- Jocelyn: (Awkward) Hey.

370
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,642
Roland: Where have you been? I've
been looking for you all morning.

371
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:44,710
<i>Jocelyn: (Evasive) Around. Doing stuff.</i>

372
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,445
<i>Roland: Well, I tried calling you.</i>

373
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,680
<i>Jocelyn: I must have turned
my phone off by mistake.</i>

374
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,984
<i>Roland: Joce, did you
see him again today?</i>

375
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,752
<i>Jocelyn: See who?</i>

376
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,120
<i>Roland: Oh, geez, you know I told you,</i>

377
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,622
you can see him as much as you want,

378
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,191
just don't keep it a
secret from me, okay?

379
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,493
I wanna know everything
you two are doing.

380
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,429
<i>Jocelyn: Look, half the time I'm
there he doesn't even want me there.</i>

381
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,331
<i>I just can't help myself.</i>

382
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,167
<i>- Roland: Well, you love him.
- Jocelyn: Yeah.</i>

383
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:12,838
<i>Roland: I love him too,
but the kid's an idiot.</i>

384
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,973
It's our son, Mutt. We're
talking about our son.

385
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,008
- Roland: Yeah.
- Johnny: Oh!

386
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,843
- Roland: Our son.
- Moira: Oh!

387
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,278
Roland: You done with that? Got it.

388
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,880
Johnny: No, I wasn't. I wasn't uh...

389
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,882
Yeah, he turned into a real nutbar.

390
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,517
Doesn't drive in cars,

391
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,020
he won't use anything plastic. (Chuckles)

392
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:30,222
Good luck with birth control, right?

393
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:33,392
Jocelyn: And then we
see you with your kids

394
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,794
and you're so... together.

395
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,899
What's your secret?

396
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,303
Moira: Listening is so very important.

397
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:47,673
Johnny: So important to listen...
To your kids.

398
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,875
Jocelyn: See, Roland? Listening.

399
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,341
Excuse me, I listen to the kid.

400
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:53,512
If he'd listened to me, he
wouldn't be sitting in a hut,

401
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,243
making his own underwear.

402
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:57,949
(Birds chirp)

403
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,454
(Door opens)

404
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,590
The Internet is a breeding
ground for freaks.

405
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,291
What're you doing?

406
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:09,428
Well, I just "sold" a pair
of sunglasses on here

407
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:13,432
and now dieforfash87
is telling me she won't pay

408
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,734
'cause she thinks they're fake.

409
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:20,873
Stevie: Okay. Um... How
about we move away-

410
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,175
David: No! I don't even
wanna sell these things.

411
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:26,111
These clothes are all that I have.

412
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:29,414
Everything else has been taken from me.

413
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,683
Well, you have your family...

414
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,852
What's your point?

415
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:37,022
I am having a very hard time
right now dealing with the idea

416
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,526
that people think that
my things are worthless,

417
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,261
- David: Or funky, or...
- Stevie: Sorry.

418
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,062
...fake.

419
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,497
Does it look like I shop on Canal Street?

420
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,965
No...

421
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,567
Okay.

422
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,636
People here don't know anything, okay?

423
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,004
Wayne huffs keyboard
cleaner for a living.

424
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,305
Well, that's not surprising.

425
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,873
You're playing to the wrong crowd.

426
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,009
You're-you have great clothes.

427
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,011
I like some of this stuff.

428
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:01,880
Like... like this. Like, I like this.

429
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,664
Ooh! Ooh...

430
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,231
I like this.

431
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,190
(Thinking) This gives me an idea.

432
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,660
So why would I sleep with my mother?

433
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:14,393
Alexis: Well, now that I
know that she's your mother,

434
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,028
that makes a lot more sense to me.

435
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,063
And you normally go
around spying on people?

436
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,766
Um, you left me here to be abducted

437
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,835
by long haul truckers. I
just went to find you.

438
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,673
So why are you sneaking
around with your mom anyway?

439
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,741
What's the big... secret?

440
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,411
It's my dad. We don't really get along.

441
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,446
He really takes the whole mayor
tradition in the family thing seriously

442
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,216
and I'm just not that down
into labels, you know?

443
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,051
- Alexis: "Labels?"
- Mutt: Yeah.

444
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:41,720
And you wonder why I make fun of you.

445
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,956
Oh, and you are totally in
sync with your parents?

446
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,891
Um... yeah,

447
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,593
because they always wanted
a daughter with a record,

448
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:51,129
who dropped out of college, so...

449
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,131
Pretty much delivered on that one.

450
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,200
(Bags rustle)

451
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,537
Ugh!

452
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,410
<i>Oh! (Running footsteps)</i>

453
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,414
(Door opens)

454
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,849
<i>Stevie: Okay, this is
gonna cheer you up.</i>

455
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,386
David: (Panting)

456
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,922
So I thought you might be
lonely without your clothes.

457
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,924
So if this isn't too dirty for you,

458
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,493
I could help take care of your stuff.

459
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,895
David: Wait, you wanna
have sex with me?

460
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,564
Stevie: No. I don't think
anybody has sex in here

461
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,032
unless they're being paid for it.

462
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,553
I thought this might be a good
place to store your clothes.

463
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,938
Is this a safe place?

464
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:36,775
Yes. I'm the only with a key.
But there's a catch.

465
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,646
I get to wear whatever I
want, anytime I want.

466
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:45,584
Fine.

467
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:55,935
Wow! Our son's clothes
are no longer in our closet.

468
00:19:55,936 --> 00:19:58,337
Something I said finally got through.

469
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:00,139
<i>David: I just found
somewhere else to put them.</i>

470
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,641
Johnny: I can't hear you from in there.

471
00:20:02,642 --> 00:20:05,044
<i>David: (Yelling loudly) I found
somewhere else to put them!</i>

472
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:08,747
Well, subconsciously I got through.

473
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:12,551
David? Alexis? Can you come here please?

474
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:14,787
<i>Woman on TV: Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the text I got from her</i>

475
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:16,422
<i>saying you left your
ring in the sauna...</i>

476
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,591
David?! Alexis?!

477
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,479
They're not going to come, dear.

478
00:20:21,895 --> 00:20:24,905
Johnny: Well, how
widespread is that news?

479
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,132
<i>Woman on TV: I can hear
the (Unclear) Deal sign.</i>

480
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:30,169
Talk about salacious!

481
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,037
<i>Man on TV: He had long day at work.
I ran into Tanya on the street.</i>

482
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:35,207
He cut off his what?!

483
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,276
- Alexis: Wait, what? - Johnny: Okay.
- David: How did it happen?

484
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,545
Johnny: Look, I just, uh...
I just want to make sure

485
00:20:39,546 --> 00:20:41,447
that, uh, you know, we're all okay.

486
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,316
What were we not okay about?

487
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:46,886
<i>Johnny: About your mother and me
feeling disconnected from you two.</i>

488
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:49,788
David: We are literally connected
by a door that does not lock.

489
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:51,957
How much... how much more
connected do you wanna be?

490
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,127
Emma. Your middle name is "Emma."

491
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,363
Alexis: Is it?

492
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:58,764
Johnny: So, we'll keep
working away at this.

493
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:00,666
I'm sorry! No, Hannah.

494
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,167
Alexis: I'm embarrassed for you.

495
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:03,096
- Well, that's that then.
- Elspeth.

496
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:04,236
- Alexis: No!
- David: Wow.

497
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:05,905
I think it's Elspeth.

498
00:21:05,906 --> 00:21:08,073
- Alexis: It isn't!
- I should know!

499
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:09,825
Wow.

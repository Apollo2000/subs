2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,770
why is there a letter of resignation on my desk?

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,700
I told you.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:10,680
I got a job offer.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,130
I don't want to hear this again.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,320
Working at a private medical co-op,moving to L.A.

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,860
This is not my addison.

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,530
My addison is a world-class neonatal surgeon.

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,310
My addison lives to cut.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,770
Your addison would've been promoted to chief of surgery.

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,740
So stop "aisoning" me.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,770
I want a change,

13
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:27,550
I need a change,

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,620
and this is how I'm gonna do it-

15
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,860
in L.A.,At that practice,

16
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,630
with those people.

17
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,980
You don't know anything about those people.

18
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,000
I know plenty. My best friend-

19
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,320
naomi-from med school,

20
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,770
she's a fertility specialist there,

21
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,080
and she's an amazing woman.

22
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,420
mother just needs a moment to herself.

23
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,950
her ex-husband sam is an internist.

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,930
You wish you had his people skills.

25
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,080
We can't keep doing this.

26
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,100
I love you. I do.

27
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,120
We're in this together.

28
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,370
But,uh,we gotta make a change.

29
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,640
violet is a psychiatrist,

30
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,020
and she's incredible- grounded,strong.

31
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,360
hello.

32
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,190
Hello?

33
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,590
Violet...

34
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,210
you have to stop calling here.

35
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,330
I'm married now.

36
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,910
cooper,a pediatrician,

37
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,090
one of the best in his field,a pro.

38
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,880
Lisa,that-

39
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,560
oh,god,I'm sorry. Lily,right?

40
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,120
Your name's lily,right?

41
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,680
sorry.Yeah,

42
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,410
uh,I'm getting a little uncomfortable,

43
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,120
if you could-

44
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,780
lori! Lori!

45
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,820
And pete,he does alternative medicine.

46
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,990
As a surgeon,I don't believe in that kind of thing,

47
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,970
but the man is a healer.

48
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,700
So I know exactly what I'm getting myself into.

49
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,610
You think you're gonna go there and do what,

50
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,660
wear jeans,walk on the beach,

51
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,990
dance in your underwear?

52
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,070
Maybe I'll dance naked.

53
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,290
You belong in the O.R. You'll be back in less than a month,

54
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,230
begging for your job.

55
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,310
No,I won'T.

56
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,370
I am changing my life.

57
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,690
Now I can walk away angry

58
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,720
or I can walk away with your blessing.

59
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,750
Either way,richard,

60
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,930

Hi.

110
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,280
I'm putting my boys in a cup.

111
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,460
I'm gonna get leslie pregnant.

112
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,700
I'm ovulating,finally.

113
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,330
Oh,congratulations.

114
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,160
That's great.

115
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,950
I've never done it into a cup before.

116
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,830
Yeah.

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,380
That can be kinda-naomi.

118
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,090
Yeah,dell,

119
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,220
can you take ken and leslie back to exam room number one?

120
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,770
I'm gonna be right with you guys,okay? Thanks.

121
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,450
yeah.

122
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,280
Just in the conference room,please. -Fine.

123
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,950
Don't worry.

125
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,630
Hi.

126
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,090
hi.

127
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,620
Nice to see you.

128
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,920
Hello. Oh.

129
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,650
so...

130
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,210
what happened to the amicable divorce?

131
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,440
It's progressive decompensation of repressed rage

132
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,190
secondary to feelings of abandonment.

133
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,710
It's shrink talk for naomi

134
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,850
finally getting pissed off that sam left heR.

135
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,470
Ooh.

136
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,560
What are they mad about now?

137
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,380
Naomi didn't tell sam that she hired me.

138
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,950
To work here?

139
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,190
Oh,oh,oh,

140
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,590
here he is,all good.

141
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,240
Oh,but... next time you want to hide your vegetables,

142
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,480
feed them to the dog.

143
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,410
But you can't shove 'em up your nose.

144
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,530
Your nose if off-limits as a hiding place. Okay?

145
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,020
ooh!

146
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,370
Mommy and daddy are fighting again.

147
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,170
Addison. Cooper.-Cooper.

148
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,190
Remember me? YeaH.
Yeah,I know.

149
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,540
Handsome with a- hi,cooper.

150
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,500
Hi.

151
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,030
Pete,hello.

152
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,000
You're back in town.

153
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
Yes. She works here.

154
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,310
Naomi hired her.

155
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,310
You're working here?

156
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,280
Y- yeah.

157
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,000
Welcome aboard.

158
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,880
Oh.

159
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,740
So naomi didn't tell any of you

160
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,770
that I was coming?

161
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,850
It's a power play.

162
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,440
Naomi's trying to show that she has the power.

163
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,000
Why did addison take the job anyway?

164
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,620
Wasn't she some big hotshot in seattle?

165
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,330
Is it just me,

166
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,690
or did naomi just run over us with a steamroller?

167
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,430
Is she crazy?

168
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,680
Oh,well,naomi's insane.

169
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,910
I mean addison.

170
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,300
Is she some kind of crazy person

171
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,390
who gets kissed once and decides to change her whole life?

172
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,340
You kissed addison?

173
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,080
Really?

174
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,080
Focus!

175
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,330
Look,I know she has the largest chunk of this practice,

176
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,100
but we agreed to equal votes.

177
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,950
We are supposed to vote.

178
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,000
Sam,you gotta do something.

179
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,860
Yeah. What,me?

180
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,300
This divorce is killing us.

181
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,520
You need to apologize.

182
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,360
Just say you were wrong for walking out

183
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,940
so we can get back to being a happy family.

184
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,570
Yeah.

185
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,500
I never-I- I didn't-

186
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,500
I am not apologizing to her.

187
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,470
She's the one.

188
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,390
Naomi hires addison and then moves her in

189
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,750
right next door to me.

190
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,370
I saw her naked this morning.

191
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,170
You saw her naked?

192
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:35,950
Does she look good naked?

193
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,480
focus!

194
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,980
So I just have to get it in the cup?

195
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,440
Yeah,just get it in the cup.

196
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,580
I want a kid.

197
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,550
I've always wanted a kid.

198
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,270
But this is just-

199
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,920
you know,a lot of our clients are nervous.

200
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,260
But just remember,once you have the baby in your arms,

201
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,510
how it got here won't matter.

202
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,380
Eyes on the prize.

203
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,140
Yeah,eyes on the prize.

204
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,220
Okay.

205
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,070
Oh,okay. 5-cent tour.

206
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,430
Exam rooms-two is for peds,

207
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,210
uh,three has the gynie exam table in it.

208
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,110
You and I will share it.

209
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,160
You didn't tell them you hired me.

210
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,140
Oh,they'll get over it.

211
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,190
It's fine.

212
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,320
Scrub sinks are over there.

213
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,990
We contract with the lab downstairs.

214
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,930
Yeah,nai,I don't think it's fine to them.

215
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,280
To them,I am the interloper.

216
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:14,870
I don't lope.

217
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,310
I own 55% of the practice.

218
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,300
I made a decision.

219
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,610
Yeah,they have to live with that decision.

220
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,000
I have to live with-they will get over it.

221
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,020
Okay,here's your birthing suite.

222
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,830
But I deliver babies in a hospital.

223
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,760
You used to deliver babies in a hospital.

224
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,210
Now unless it's a c-section,

225
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,380
you deliver babies here.

226
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,580
It's very popular with the patients.

227
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,210
Okay.

228
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,500
Uh,so I guess I should meet my staff.

229
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,880
I don't have a staff.

230
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,560
okay.

231
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,070
Um,let me see if I...

232
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,160
understand this.

233
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,480
I left a hospital with a state-of-the-art

234
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,870
O.B.- G.Y.N. Wing

235
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,990
and a staff of 60-

236
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,000
you'll have dell.

237
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,140
He's studying to be a midwife.

238
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,710
The cute boy who answers the phone?

239
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,670
Plus you'll have pete.

240
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,060
Laboring moms love pete.

241
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,040
The alternative medicine guru?

242
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,820
Do you know how many babies I deliver a day?

243
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,440
Well,here you'll be lucky if you deliver one.

244
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,240
One patient the entire day?

245
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,150
I told you,we do things differently here.

246
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,320
This may be a big city,

247
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,560
but this co-op is about practicing small-town medicine.

248
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,900
Every patient is special,

249
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,700
every patient gets our full attention.

250
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,710
It's not about surgeries.

251
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,600
It's about connecting.

252
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,640
I- I told you this.

253
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,090
Yeah,I know. I know.

254
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,640
I just...

255
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,860
I didn't think it'd be one patient the entire day.

256
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,580
You wanted change.

257
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,910
This is it.

258
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
Yeah.

259
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
This is it.

260
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,860
Hey,naomi.

261
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,870
Uh,we need to talk to you.

262
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,800
I'm just gonna go some-

263
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,890
no,stay.

264
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,300
She is staying.

265
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,600
You can't just do this.

266
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,120
You can't bring in somebody without a vote.

267
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,090
Yeah,this is not-

268
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,150
this is not a,uh-

269
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,340
what is that?

270
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,950
Just get-somebody's getting happy.

271
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,740
No,it'sr. Wilson giving a sperm deposit.

272
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,680
Get away from the door.

273
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,740
That's a loud deposit.

274
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,490
Go,mr. Wilson.

275
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,110
You guys are so immature.

276
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,400
Is is,uh,

277
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,590
definitely different.

278
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,860
'Cause his neighbors have got to be making noise complaints.

279
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,830
Just go.

280
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,910
Help! Please,come quick.

281
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,390
I was just trying to help him get in the mood,

282
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,450
and now he's not moving.

283
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,360
What's wrong with him?

284
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,540
His pupil's blown.

285
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,480
He's having a stroke.

286
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,340
all right,he's had three rounds of epi and a 200 lido bolus.

287
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,130
Defib times 5 on scene.

288
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,890
Get out of my waY. Hold C.P.R.

289
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,890
How long has he been down?

290
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,430
Uh,at least 20 minutes.

291
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:27,760
I'm gonna call it.

292
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,820
What? What about those?

293
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,780
Don't you want the shocky things?

294
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,600
He's been down too long.

295
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,040
No point in turning this into a show.

296
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,850
No! No!

297
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,020
Use the shocky things.

298
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,150
I'm sorry. He's gone.

299
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,980
time of death- 9:42 A.M. no.

300
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,170
We-we were gonna have a baby.

301
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,180
He was-he was gonna be a dad.

302
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,230
I- I-I want-I want-I want his sperm.

303
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,280
Uh,he didn't get a chance to make his-his donation b- before he died.

304
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,880
But you can take it from him now.

305
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,720
what?

306
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,260
I want his sperm.

307
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,650
I want ken's sperm now!

308
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,250

309
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,520
I get naomi's mad-

310
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,570
hell hath no fury and all that.

311
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,170
And I know the practice needs an O.B.- G.Y.N.,

312
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,610
But since when do we not vote?

313
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,200
I had sex with this woman last night.

314
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,460
The reason we started this practice

315
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,110
is so we could be in charge of our own destiny.

316
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,820
Very real,you know,

317
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,000
internet sex.

318
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,510
But she wanted me to call her mama,

319
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,920
but she promised all this really freaky stuff,

320
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,690
and I'm talkin',like,

321
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,660
stuff.

322
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,350
Okay. eww.

323
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,400
That's it. I'm done.

324
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,650
No. What? Why?

325
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,000
Because you're a sex addict or an internet addict

326
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,030
or some kind of freaky addict.

327
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,370
Yeah,and you're a stalker.

328
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,010
You're stalking your married ex-boyfriend.

329
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,120
I am not.

330
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,500
I'M... c-calling him occasionally.

331
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,090
Stalker.

332
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,140
Okay,you know what?That's it.

333
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,640
I- I'm cutting you off,for your own good.

334
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,750
You ain't gettin' no help from me.

335
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,050
Oh,come on,stalker.

336
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,680
I'm not a stalker!

337
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,090
hey. I,uh...

338
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,510
just wanted to say that I am really sorry

339
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,530
about naomi and the job.

340
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,220
I-I got a 9-1-1 page.

341
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,160
do you think there's something wrong with,

342
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,160
uh,having sex with a woman o wants you to call her...

343
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,820
mama?

344
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,740
Uh...

345
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,510
the's a patient for you.

346
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,180
Thank god.

347
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,100
No,not him. You.

348
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,980
Uh,this is bill henderson and his daughter lucy.

349
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,190
This is dr. Montgomery.She'll be delivering your baby.

350
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,040
Hi.
Ow!

351
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,820
yeah,it hurts.

352
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,660
It hurts,doesn't it?

353
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,150
That's what you get for getting pregnant.

354
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,380
She hid it from me for months,

355
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,460
and then all of a sudden it's,"daddy,

356
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,330
I'm in labor."

357
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,070
How about we get you into the birthing suite?

358
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,440
Dell,see if we have a chart on lucy.

359
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,750
Hey,can I get in on this?

360
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,390
I haven't gotten a lot of field experience for my midwife training.

361
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,170
I- I need the hours.

362
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,700
How about you just find the chart?

363
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,820
ken's sperm...

364
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,510
you want us to take ken's sperm right out of...

365
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,300
are you sure?

366
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,320
I'm sure.

367
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,630
I mean,you can do it,right?

368
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,410
Look here.

369
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,130
You're distressed.I understand.

370
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,320
But unless you have written consent from the deceased,

371
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,620
no way am I gonna let you molest your husband's corpse.

372
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,460
Well...okay,well,let's not use words like,

373
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,040
uh,"molest" or "corpse" about her loved one.

374
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,150
And it's her boyfriend,

375
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,870
not her husband.

376
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,060
Oh. Well,fine.

377
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,410
She wants sperm of a man she has no legal rights to.

378
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,090
That makes it all better.

379
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,250
No.

380
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,380
W-

381
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,680
okay. Hey,let's-can we stop-

382
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,080
uh,charlotte,right?

383
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,470
You know my name,sam.

384
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,000
N't act like you don'T.

385
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,330
I'm chief of staff here,

386
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,070
and you know it.

387
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,010
you and I,we-we can work on this together.

388
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,180
We can figure this out because I'm a good person,

389
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,410
you're a good person.

390
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,250
We-I mean we can-right?

391
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,000
We can... together?

392
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,620
I did read your book,by the way.

393
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,650
Oh,great.

394
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,960
I took issue with most of it.

395
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,070
See,now I'm on her side.

396
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,710
We want ken's sperm,or you got a fight on your hands.

397
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,470
That dead man's swimmers are staying exactly where they are.

398
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,620
You got a way to fight me on that,

399
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,910
I'd like to see you try.

400
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,820
Oh.

401
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,540
I'm calling naomi on you.

402
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,990
Lucy henderson.

403
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,900
Uh,she was my patient till she got pregnant.

404
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,470
No previous medical problems.

405
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,450
It looks good.
Mm-hmm.

406
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,860
Well,the dad is mad as hell.

407
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,370
I could use your help in there.

408
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,440
Oh,uh,yeah. No. That...

409
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,850
down there is not my area.

410
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,800
So when the baby comes out,

411
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,920
I'd be happy to examine it.

412
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,150
Until then,godspeed.

413
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,080
give me two secs to grab my kit.

414
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,700
I'll join you.

415
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,250
For?

416
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,400
If you'd read further in her chart,

417
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,440
you'd see she has a holistic birth plan.

418
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,080
Oh,my god.

419
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,380
Are you kidding me?

420
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,240
Laboring moms love pete.

421
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,110
Hey,listen,uM...

422
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,380
you moving here,that didn't have anything to do

423
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,510
with me kissing you,did it?

424
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,110
What?

425
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,490
It's okay. It's just that-

426
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,630
well,you should know it was just a kiss.

427
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,800
Wait a minute. You think that I moved here because you kissed me?

428
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,220
It was a good kiss.

429
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,240
It was an excellent kiss.

430
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,830
But-stop talking.

431
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,480
all right.

432
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,010
I did not move here because you kissed me.

433
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,580
okay.

434
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,980
You are actually deranged enough to think

435
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,610
that iould pick up my entire life and move because of a kiss?

436
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:20,670
Let me clear that up for you.

437
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,630
I wouldn'T.

438
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,160
Okay.

439
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,180
Shut up.Just-just go in there

440
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,690
and do your little eastern voodoo thing you do,

441
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,790
and let's help that girl have her baby in peace.

442
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,190
What do you expect me to do?

443
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,390
He was your patient.

444
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,320
My patient's dead.

445
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,370
This is about your patient who wants a dead man's sperm.

446
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,760
Besides,I got mad.

447
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,440
You got mad?

448
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,950
I got mad.

449
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,950
You got mad?

450
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,200
Apparently neither one of us

451
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,820
can make good decisions when we're mad.

452
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,490
Another doctor in the practice who can bill is a very good decision.

453
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,280
We agreed that when we split,we would not let it affect the work.

454
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,300
My work is fine.

455
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,340
in fact,watch me take care of my patient.

456
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,330
Where do you think you're going?

457
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,410
If the hospital's not gonna touch the body,then I will.

458
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,750
You lay a hand on that man,and I will have you arrested.

459
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,650
I'm not a person who plays games,naomi.

460
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,430
You know that.

461
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,500
Now please step back.

462
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,880
Okay,now I'm mad.

463
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,990
I told you.

464
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,090
you know,I-I-I could help.

465
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,170
You know,with lucy.

466
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,730
I'm good.

467
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,230
You don't take me seriously.

468
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:33,910
What?

469
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,390
You think I'm dumb surfer boy.

470
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,220
You think I'm eye candy.

471
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,590
You have no respect for me or my midwifery skills.

472
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,700
I have...

473
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,990
total respect for you and your... midwifery skills?

474
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,140
Is-is that even a word,midwifery?

475
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,240
It's a word.

476
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,680
It's definitely a word.

477
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,440
9,242. 9,243. 9,244.9,245...

478
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,150
jenny?

479
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,690
she's been counting the tiles for over an hour.

480
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,890
You know this lady?

481
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,670
Yes,I do.

482
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,990
9,255. 9,256. 9,257...

483
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,200
what the hell happened to her?

484
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,190
9,262. 9,263.9,264. 9,265.9,266. 9,2...

485
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,290
she had your card in her wallet.

486
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,060
Well,thank you.

487
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,270
Thank you for calling me.

488
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,150
My sister,

489
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,440
she's got mental problems.

490
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,430
She's a good person,

491
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,030
but she's got mental problems.

492
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,560
That's why I called you before I called the cops.

493
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,600
Oh,y-you- we don't need the police.

494
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,450
I can handle this.

495
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,310
Can you do it quick?

496
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,380
I mean,she can't stay on the floor like that.

497
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,130
She's obstructing customer flow and if she's dang-

498
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,940
look,if you give me some time,

499
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,000
I will take her out of your hair.

500
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,250
Can you do that for me,

501
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,160
uh,"paul"? Can you do that?

502
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,160
I guess.

503
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,540
Thank you.

504
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,950
9,332. 9,333. 9,334.

505
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,060
9,335. 9,336.

506
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,490
9,337. 9,338. 9,339.

507
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,760
9,340. 9,341.

508
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,010
9,342.

509
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,850
9,343. 9,344.

510
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,950
9,345. 9,346.

511
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,730
9,347.

512
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,120
9,348. 9,349...

513
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,790
you're getting charged by the hour,

514
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,000
so you might as well hear me.

515
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,660
inhale.

516
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,350
Exhale.

517
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:24,920
Ooh.

518
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,070
Focus on me. Exhale.

519
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:27,830
Deep breaths.

520
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,250
In. Out.

521
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,180
Good.

522
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,430
Good. Much better.

523
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,260
my dad,he-he's just mad.

524
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,320
I- I want this baby.

525
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,180
I- I just-I screwed up.

526
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,180
I'm such a screwup.

527
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,530
Hey,lucy...

528
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,810
listen...

529
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,810
everyone screws up once in a while.

530
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,270
And in this room,you get a free pass.

531
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,980
Okay?

532
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,000
Okay.

533
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,630
These are ken and leslie's medical records,

534
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,860
including ken's signature

535
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,100
on a contract with my office regarding his donation.

536
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,050
Now I think that is more than implied.

537
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,460
Live consent is different-

538
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,660
you're considering this?

539
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,000
It could be persuasive in court.

540
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,150
Your patient will sign something indemnifying us against legal action?

541
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,870
She just wants her baby.

542
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,120
Fine.

543
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,160
You do the procedure.

544
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,770
You take possession of the sperm.

545
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,260
Thank you for your help.

546
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,840
Well done.

547
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,550
Very badass.

548
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,710
I know. Right?

549
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,020
Get away from me.

550
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,590
It's good.

551
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,970
Are you dr. Naomi bennett?

552
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:42,510
I am.

553
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,000
You better get that little tramp's claws off my husband's sperm,

554
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,690
or I will sue you and this place so fast,your head will spin.

555
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,480
Who are you?

556
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,450
I'm ken wilson's wife.

557
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,750
Jenny,did something happen to make you feel out of control here in the store?

558
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,570
okay,well,we've been working on rage

559
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,250
directed toward your husband for leaving you.

560
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,340
Are-are you angry?

561
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,110
th-that's okay.

562
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,520
Feel the feelings.

563
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,140
Get angry.

564
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,250
Let-let's talk about getting angry.

565
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,530
She's not answering.

566
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,670
Yeah,I got that,paul.

567
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,930
Now what's the deal?

568
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,660
She,uh,gets upset,so she goes crazy with the counting?

569
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,220
Well,for many people counting establishes...

570
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,260
a sense of order.

571
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,250
Oh,my god.When did my knees turn 80?

572
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,050
We got knee pads on aisle eight.

573
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,020
No.

574
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,930
Hey,jenny...

575
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,570
can you look up at me?

576
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,020
Can you-can you look into my eyes?

577
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,030
Come on,jenny.

578
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,200
I know you can do this.

579
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,270
Aah!

580
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,410
whoa. Whoa.

581
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,630
Whoa. Whoa.

582
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:42,790
you okay?

583
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,940
Yes,I'mine.

584
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,190
You sure?-Yes.

585
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,630
10,168. 10,169.

586
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,400
10,170. 10,171.

587
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,140
10,172. 10,17...

588
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,540
just checking to see if you need anything,any help.

589
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,900
We're all good.

590
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,240
okay,lucy,

591
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,230
you ready to push?

592
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,290
Please.Uh,mr. Henderson,

593
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,020
your daughter's gonna start pushing now.

594
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,740
Would you like to come and sit by her side?

595
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,700
For what?

596
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,880
you know,why don't you just squeeze my hand,

597
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,970
okay,if you need to?

598
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,570
Okay.

599
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,320
lucy,you ready?

600
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:23,960
Yeah.

601
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100
Okay,go ahead and push.

602
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,420
good. Push.

603
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,380
good. Good. Push.

604
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,840
that's good. Push.

605
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,730
stop. Stop.

606
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,160
She's short of breath with J.V.D.

607
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,790
I thought eastern medicine was your thing.

608
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,770
I have a lot of things.

609
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,130
Now she's short of breath with J.V.D.

610
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,870
Do you want to double-check or you gonna trust me?

611
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,280
the baby's in distress.

612
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,480
Okay,lucy,don't push for right now,all right?

613
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,170
Just give me a minute,okay?

614
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,370
Dr. Montgomery,something's wrong with her.

615
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,640
Lucy? Lucy.

616
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,840
Lucy,wake up.

617
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,560
Lucy? Okay,get her on high-flow oxygen.

618
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,550
Get an ambulance,dell.I was just holding her hand.

619
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,260
She's going into congestive heart failure,dell.

620
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,530
Ambulance,now!

621
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,900
Lucy,honey? Her mom died...

622
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,850
in childbirth.

623
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,000
She-she died having lucy.

630
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,140
I'm applying pressure,

631
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,490
but the cord is compressed...

632
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,850
she's gonna be okay,right?

633
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,930
And lucy's blood is flooding her lungs,

634
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,160
and the umbilical cord is cutting off the baby's blood supply.

635
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,140
I just called the ambulance.

636
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,730
How long does it take for an ambulance to get here?

637
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,180
10 to 20 minutes in traffic.

638
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,880
Addison,we don't have 10 to 20 minutes.

639
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,410
I know.

640
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
We're gonna lose her and the baby.

641
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,430
I know.

642
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,390
I thought you ght be hungry.

643
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,770
You'll have to pay for it.

644
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
That and the ice pack-

645
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,020
and the flip-flops,uh,buT...

646
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,200
thanks.

647
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,210
You okay?

648
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,570
Yeah. It's just...

649
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,700
look,I know her.

650
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,150
She's been coming to see me for months.

651
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,560
And she's gentle.

652
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,400
72. 73. 74. 75...

653
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,600
paul!

654
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,640
Look,I'm sorry,

655
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,240
but I don't think...

656
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,830
I don't think you know exactly how to handle this.

657
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,460
I do know how to handle this.

658
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,320
There has gotta be something here that I'm not seeing,

659
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,390
something she's not telling me.

660
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,970
No offense,but if she's not telling her shrink things,

661
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,100
then you must not be very good at your job.

662
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,730
You know what?

663
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,030
Patients hold things in,paul.

664
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,360
They hold things in for years.

665
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,080
What's going on with the ice pack?

666
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,220
Just do-do no- do not touch her.

667
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:32,910
I'm sorry,violet.

668
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:33,870
We have to-

669
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,390
paul,think of your sister.

670
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,310
Please.

671
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:36,740
U know,I'm-

672
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,090
I'm working here,cooper.

673
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,110
Really? It looks like you're shopping.

674
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,530
It's a joke. Look,dell told me you were here.

675
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,440
I just thought I'd come by,see if you needed any help.

676
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,110
No,I don't need any help,okay?

677
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,420
And you know what? This-

678
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,290
you got in your car,

679
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,990
you drove all the way down here to see if I was still mad at you?

680
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,200
Who is the stalker now?

681
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,790
Let-let's just all settle down.

682
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,320
I'm sorry.

683
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,380
I gotta let 'em take her.

684
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,680
If she gets violent with you again-

685
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,540
violent?

686
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,610
She got violent with you?

687
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,170
Come...

688
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,170
just-your pupils-

689
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,160
not now,cooper.

690
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,960
Look,this is a psychiatric emergency.

691
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,350
I can handlehis.I can stabilize her.

692
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,130
Just give me a minute and give me backup if I need it.

693
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,950
I just feel...

694
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,230
I- if-if I knew how it started

695
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,050
or where she was when it happened...

696
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,750
so... how do you figure out how it started?

697
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,160
You-you have security cameras,don't you?

698
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,590
he told me he wanted to find himself

699
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,820
turns out he wanted to find me,

700
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,050
only 15 years younger and half as smart.

701
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,490
Any idea what that's like?

702
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,660
I think I can imagine.

703
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,240
Like I don't feel my age,

704
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,540
I don't feel scared?

705
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,670
Only I feel it alone while he's yanking in a cup

706
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,470
for some chick he met hiking in sedona.

707
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,890
Maria,I-I know this is unfair.

708
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,680
I understand,believe me.

709
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,130
You know,I was with him 17 years.

710
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,450
Maria,ken really wanted leslie to have his baby.

711
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,250
And leslie wants leslie to have ken's money.

712
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,720
I don't think that she would do that.

713
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,830
I didn't think my husband would dump me.

714
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,050
So there you go.

715
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,140
Uh,if-if you want protection-

716
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,100
legal protection-

717
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,930
I think that leslie would agree to whatever you ask.

718
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,070
I don't want protection.

719
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,810
I want ken's sperm.

720
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,530
What?

721
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,660
For myself.

722
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,350
Now we'll see who ends up alone,right?

723
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,550
Where the hell is the ambulance?

724
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,710
Addison,you have to make a choice.

725
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,470
What do you mean,make a choice?

726
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,000
If I wait any longer for the ambulance,

727
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,200
I could lose them both.

728
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,850
Or I could get the baby out and maybe save them.

729
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,050
Save them,of course.

730
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,290
Maybe. Maybe save them.

731
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,340
Dell,glove up.

732
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,130
I need you to decompress the cord. Come here.

733
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,170
Okay,like this?

734
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,050
Yes,that's good.

735
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,060
Steady pressure.

736
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,560
Okay,okay.

737
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,320
I need to be in a hospital.

738
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,950
There's no way I can perform a c-section here.

739
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,790
It's not sterile. I don't have any surgical equipment...

740
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,230
addison- no extra blood

741
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,010
and an epidural would take way too long to take effect.

742
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,460
Addison,she's a completely healthy 17 yr olD.

743
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,140
No one could have foreseen this complication.

744
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,280
Do you know what happens to a person

745
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,740
when a scalpel slices into them without anesthesia?

746
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,190
Addison,I-

747
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,870
shut up!

748
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,740
I am trying to talk myself into this,

749
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,020
and I cannot do it when you keep addisoning me.

750
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,130
So just...

751
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,770
hold on.

752
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,200
Okay.

753
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,220
Pete,take over for dell.

754
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,420
Dell,go find a surgical tray from somewhere.

755
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,670
She's gonna feel every slice,

756
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,950
but we have to try.

757
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,850
Addison- I am going to scrub in and find sterile drapes.

758
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,100
We have a local anesthetic,right?

759
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,080
That will help with the pain.

760
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,590
Addison.

761
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,240
Stop addisoning me.

762
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,490
I can treat her so she won't feel any pain.

763
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,170
The cameras show her on this aisle.

764
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,170
She stopped. Next thing,

765
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,140
she's looking at the floor.

766
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,300
maybe some kind of camping accident?

767
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,590
Something traumatic?

768
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,910
or may-maybe,you know,

769
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,970
this guy,uh,he works here,

770
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,340
he-he told me that marshmallow gets so hot it sticks like napalm.

771
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,780
That's not that bad,I guess.

772
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,530
not bad enough for tile counting.

773
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,670
They had a house at the lake.

774
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,320
I've stimulated the needles.

775
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,290
Lidocaine's in.

776
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,290
Her pain receptors are blocked.She's ready.

777
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,160
Are you sure she's not gonna feel anything?

778
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:17,760
I'm sure.

779
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,370
Because if she wakes up screaming in pain-

780
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,410
I'm sure.I'm very good at what I do.

781
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,550
Are you really,really,really sure?

782
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,080
Trust me.

783
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,510
Okay.

784
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,790
Here we go.

785
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,330
I'm gonna cut on three.

786
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,380
One...

787
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,230
Two...

788
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,190
Three.

789
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,670
Okay,okay.

790
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,600
Yay. OkaY.

791
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,600
Did i or did I not say trust me?

792
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,970
You did.

793
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,130
And I do... noW.

794
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,010
That was good.

795
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:03,800
It was good?

796
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,680
There's no time to celebrate.

797
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,390
We have to move fast.

798
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:09,460
Both mom and baby are still in danger.

799
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,680
she can't just swoop in and take it.

800
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,270
She was divorcing ken's sperm.

801
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,650
She was with ken for 17 years,for god sake.

802
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,210
I thought we were on leslie's side.

803
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,230
You would.

804
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,070
She is your patienT.

805
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,400
You know,a marriage should count for something.

806
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,900
And it doesn't.He just moved on.

807
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,890
Oh,come on.

808
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,840
Could we please not make this about us right now?

809
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,960
I'm talking about ken.

810
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,450
He bailed,she got nothing.

811
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,670
He died.

812
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,590
All things considered,

813
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,520
I'd rather be her.

814
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,770
Oh,you want to be the one that people feel sorry for,

815
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:35,520
the one who got left?

816
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,750
I didn't-don't you think for one moment

817
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,230
that I have been taking any of this lightly.

818
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh,no. You walked out.

819
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,530
I did not walk out.

820
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,610
I said I was unhappy,

821
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,280
that I was questioning.

822
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,170
And instead of trying,

823
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,050
instead of working on it,

824
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:50,910
you just shut the door.

825
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,210
You weren't in love anymore.

826
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,460
Now how are we supposed to work on that?

827
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,060
I never said that.

828
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,430
You know what?I am not an idiot. I knew.

829
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,050
I knew exactly what you were saying.

830
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,900
So then you fight.

831
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,140
You have some passion about the thing.

832
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,180
I wanted to see you fight-

833
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,080
just once-for us.

834
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,110
Naomi,I'm sorry-

835
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,220
profoundly-for hurting you.

836
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,180
But you're fooling yourself

837
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,930
if you think you're the only one who got left.

838
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:23,690
what are we looking for?

839
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,500
Stop talking so I can think.

840
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,270
Something in the ad-

841
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,910
that's what triggered her.

842
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,060
did you have a boy?

843
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,020
jenny,did you have a son that we haven't talked about?

844
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,780
Did something happen to him?

845
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,050
25,132...

846
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,840
jenny...

847
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,380
did he...

848
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,350
did-did you lose your son?

849
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,150
Did he pass away?

850
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,910
You're gonna make me lose my place!

851
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,190
25,136.

852
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,290
25,137. 25...

853
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,250
he died.

854
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:19,860
One. Two. Three.

855
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,960
One. Two. Three. Four.

856
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:26,190
One. Two. Three...

857
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,730
if you really want ken's sperm,

858
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,660
you can fight it out.

859
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,440
You probably have more rights than leslie.

860
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,520
But with all the legal wrangling,

861
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,450
most likely 24 hours will pass,

862
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,780
ken won't be viable...

863
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,000
nobody gets anything.

864
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,300
Okay.

865
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,940
Let's do that.

866
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:55,150
You honestly never thought about it in all those years,

867
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,820
leaving him?

868
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,850
Nothing's perfect.

869
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,290
But I made my peace.

870
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,650
Yeah,I did,too.

871
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,810
At least I thought I did.

872
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,300
I yelled at him so much...

873
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,000
last time I saw him.

874
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,390
God.

875
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,350
Maria... at some point,you have to let him go.

876
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,780
Oh,okay.

877
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,580
Oh,it's a girL.

878
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,680
Come on,baby.

879
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,700
you want to come hold your granddaughter?

880
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,310
oh,yeah.

881
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,190
welcome,little girl.

882
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,140
Aww.

883
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,090
She looks just like lucy.

884
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,310
addison.

885
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,700
she's in v-tach.

886
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,280
I'm on it.

887
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,430
I've gotta close.

888
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,340
If she has any chance,I have to close.

889
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,120
Charging to 200.

890
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,610
Clear.

891
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,740
Again. 300.

892
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,310
The paramedics are here.They're bringing in a stretcher.

893
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,470
No!No! Clear.

894
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,260
We've got an open body cavity in a barely sterile environment.

895
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,030
Do not let them cross the threshold until I say so.

896
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,670
Understand?

897
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,600
Got it.

898
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,840
How are you doin' there,pete?

899
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,760
I'm kickin' ass and takin' names. You?

900
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,080
Ass kicking and name taking are on my résum?

901
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,860
Charging to 360. Clear.

902
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,950
Start her on a lidocaine drip,2 migs per minute.

903
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,330
0-2 at 10 liters.

904
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,410
Hey there.

905
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,940
Did I have the baby?

906
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,360
Yes,you did.

907
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,230
Is my dad...

908
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,350
is he mad?

909
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,640
No,your dad is not mad at you.

910
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,640
thank you...

911
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,370
for...

912
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,540
thank you.

913
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,570
Oh.well,that was...

914
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,600
pretty cool.

915
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,720
Oh.

916
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,800
Dell.

917
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,980
Good work in there.

918
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,790
I didn't come down here because you kissed me.

919
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,350
Okay.

920
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,370
I didn'T.

921
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:12,880
Okay.

922
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,870
I need you to say it.

923
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:18,520
You did not move down here because I kissed you.

924
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,280
You so moved down here because I kissed you.

925
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,110
I heard that.

926
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,590
uh,maria's gonna let leslie have it.

927
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,310
We can do the extraction on ken.

928
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,490
What'd you say?

929
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,000
Just that it was time...

930
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,420
to let him go.

931
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,390
Good.

932
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,730
That's,uh,that's good.

933
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,040
okay.

934
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,440
Oh,and my book...

935
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,020
was brilliant.

936
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,510
475. 476. 477...

937
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,830
his name was will.

938
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,240
Hey,paul,do you think you could clear out this area,

939
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,980
just for a little while...

940
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,770
for jenny?

941
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,780
Yeah.

942
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,280
I could do that for jenny.

943
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,160
hey,jenny.

944
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,140
This is-this is dr. Freedman.

945
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,550
He's a-he's a pediatrician.

946
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,280
And he's my friend.

947
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,740
Hi.

948
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,360
I have will's file here.

949
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,220
um,it says he was suffering from 
double vision when you brought him in.

950
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,330
He was 10. Diagnosed with a brain em glioma.

951
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,910
is that something they could've caught earlier?

952
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,550
No,they got it early.

953
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,740
But because of the location of the tumor in the brain,

954
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,570
it was inoperable.

955
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,160
So will started chemo and radiation,

956
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,670
and the tumor responded at first.

957
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,450
But then... will developed kidney failure.

958
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,630
well,that happens with chemo a lot.

959
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,630
At that point,you and your husband decided to stop treatment.

960
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,320
Is that right,jenny?

961
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:09,120
574. 575. 576...

962
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,130
making that choice...

963
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,160
a lot of people aren't strong enough to do that.

964
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,810
These tumors don't quit.

965
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,540
Treatment makes kids so sick they can't do anything.

966
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,720
and then you didn't come back to the hospital for a few months.

967
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,750
Did you go away...

968
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,100
to the lake?

969
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,290
w- we all went together.

970
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,110
that's what I would've done,

971
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,160
exactly.

972
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,280
When you came back to the hospital,

973
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,210
will was having trouble speaking...

974
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,480
but his spirits were high.

975
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,570
His spirits were good.

976
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,190
Sounds like he was a great kid.

977
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,330
Yes,it does.

978
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,180
And then?

979
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,110
He went into a coma.

980
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,330
576. 577...

981
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,930
they made him comfortable,

982
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,660
made sure everyone had a chance to say good-bye.

983
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:28,180
And on the 16th at 5:13 A.M.,

984
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,160
They took him off the machines.

985
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,200
589.

986
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,830
And...

987
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,440
589.

988
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,930
It says you held him and...

989
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,890
he breathed on his own for over four hours.

990
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,870
594. 594.

991
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,020
That was hard...

992
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,460
holding him like that...

993
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,770
for all that time.

994
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,680
5... 9... 5...

995
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,950
will...

996
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:16,090
he had the most aggressive kind of brain cancer that a kid can have.

997
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,200
you didn't make it happen.

998
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,980
And there's no cure,

999
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:24,360
only the choice in how you're gonna ride it out.

1000
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,990
You did everything a great mom could do.

1001
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,370
So... no matter how you second-guess yourself

1002
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,740
or what your head tells you,

1003
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,290
you didn't let your son down.

1004
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,280
You did not let your son down.

1005
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,600
Oh,my god. Oh,my god.

1006
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,690
My baby.

1007
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,540
bye,honey.

1008
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,650
thank you.

1009
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,730
She's-she's all right,huh?

1010
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,070
Yeah,she's gonna be all right.

1011
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,330
My assistant.

1012
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,860
Yeah... I was.

1013
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,520
Don't forget to-

1014
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,230
yeah,I'll-I'll pay for the stuff,paul.

1015
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,910
thanks...

1016
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,210
for coming down.

1017
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,580
I'm a better person than you are.

1018
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,050
The thing is,cooper-

1019
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,080
okay,the thing is that...

1020
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,860
I am kind of a stalker.

1021
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,610
I know.

1022
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,530
why didn't you tell them I was coming?

1023
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,320
Truth.

1024
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,010
All right,fine.

1025
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,480
I need you here. Okay?

1026
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,480
I need you here...

1027
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,850
because I'M... tired and I'm lonely,

1028
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,460
and my best friend divorced me,

1029
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,710
and I have no one.

1030
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,160
I need you here to be my someone.

1031
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,300
Okay.

1032
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,540
uh,we want to see you in the conference room...

1033
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,260
if that's okay-

1034
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,230
I mean now.

1035
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,410
we're a team.

1036
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,500
We're partners,naomi.

1037
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,910
you can't just bring somebody in.

1038
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:54,760
without asking us.

1039
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,380
yeah.

1040
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,530
We're a democracy. We vote.

1041
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,150
We vote.We vote or it doesn't happen.

1042
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,020
You're right.

1043
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,170
We should've voted.

1044
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,190
I was wrong.

1045
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,660
Good.

1046
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,260
Okay,let's vote.

1047
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,500
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa.

1048
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,000
Hold on a minute.

1049
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,610
Uh,I have been working here less than 24 hours,

1050
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,940
and in that time I discovered that I not welcome here,

1051
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,730
I learned I am a one-man gynie show,

1052
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,340
and I performedcrazy macgyver surgery,

1053
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,500
and... sam saw my booty.

1054
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,950
so... this has not been a great day for me.

1055
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,420
This day kind of sucked.

1056
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,320
But you know what?

1057
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,440
I had one patient-

1058
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:43,480
one patient the entire day- and I loved it.

1059
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,200
So you want me gone?

1060
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,750
Too bad. I'm in.

1061
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,490
I'm putting my foot down.

1062
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,880
My foot's down.

1063
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,600
It's down.

1064
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,260
I'm not going anywhere.

1065
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,020
So...

1066
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,210
yeah.

1067
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,500
I thought I...

1068
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,800
I thought I had a big finish but...

1069
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,770
I don'T.So...

1070
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,090
I'm done.

1071
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,720
No,no.

1072
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,470
I do have a big finish.

1073
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,030
If I hadn't been here today,

1074
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,030
if you'd had someone else,

1075
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,050
that girl would've died delivering her baby.

1076
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,950
I saved her life.

1077
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,230
I saved your asses.

1078
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,400
I'm a world-class neonatal surgeon.

1079
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,590
And I'm here to stay.

1080

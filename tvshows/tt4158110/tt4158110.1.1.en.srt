1
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:01,935
Hello, friend.

2
00:00:02,651 --> 00:00:03,941
Hello, friend?

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,343
That's lame.

4
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:07,539
Maybe I should give you a name,

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,211
but that's a slippery slope.

6
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:10,123
You're only in my head.

7
00:00:10,124 --> 00:00:12,047
We have to remember that.

8
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:13,828
Shit.

9
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:14,710
It's actually happened,

10
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:16,822
I'm talking to an imaginary person.

11
00:00:18,499 --> 00:00:19,700
What I'm about to tell you

12
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:21,039
is top secret,

13
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,138
a conspiracy bigger than all of us.

14
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,662
There's a powerful
group of people out there

15
00:00:26,663 --> 00:00:28,702
that are secretly running the world.

16
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,334
I'm talking about the
guys no one knows about,

17
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:34,182
the guys that are invisible.

18
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:38,519
The top 1% of the top
1%, the guys that play God

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,336
without permission.

20
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:44,547
And now I think they're following me.

21
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,591
This is about last night.

22
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:58,148
I should've gone to
Angela's birthday party.

23
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:00,799
Instead, I went to...

24
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:14,149
Hey, Ron.

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,603
There you go.

26
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,799
You're Ron.

27
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:01,036
But your real name is Rohit Mehta.

28
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,819
You changed it to Ron when you bought

29
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,324
your first Ron's Coffee Shop

30
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,006
six years ago.

31
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:09,845
Now you got 17 of 'em with
8 more coming next quarter.

32
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:14,666
May I help you with something?

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,102
I like coming here 'cause
your Wi-Fi was fast.

34
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:19,241
I mean, you're one of the few spots

35
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:22,011
that has a fiber connection
with gigabit speed.

36
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:23,313
It's good.

37
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,277
So good, it scratched
that part of my mind, part

38
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:31,038
that doesn't allow good
to exist without condition,

39
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,702
so I started intercepting all the traffic

40
00:02:33,703 --> 00:02:34,972
on your network.

41
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:37,260
That's when I noticed something strange.

42
00:02:38,312 --> 00:02:41,015
It's when I decided to hack you.

43
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,783
- Hack...
- I know you run a website

44
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:46,313
- called Plato's Boys.
- Pardon me?

45
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:48,999
You're using Tor networking
to keep the servers anonymous.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,050
You made it really hard

47
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,808
for anyone to see it, but I saw it.

48
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:54,717
The onion routing protocol,

49
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:56,999
it's not as anonymous as you think it is.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,999
Whoever's in control of the exit nodes

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,999
is also in control of the traffic,

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,777
which makes me...

53
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:04,999
the one in control.

54
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:08,999
I must ask you to kindly leave.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,934
I own everything. All your emails.

56
00:03:11,935 --> 00:03:13,498
All your files.

57
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:14,999
All your... pics.

58
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,340
Get out of here right now,

59
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:22,154
- or I'll call the...
- Police?

60
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:23,198
You want them to find out

61
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,439
about the 100 terabytes
of child pornography

62
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,791
you serve to your 400,000 users?

63
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:31,117
Personally, man, I was

64
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:32,800
hoping it was just gonna be

65
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:34,624
some BDSM stuff.

66
00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:37,887
You realize how much
simpler that would have been?

67
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,299
I did not hurt anyone.

68
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,299
I never did.

69
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,134
That's my...

70
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:55,697
personal life.

71
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,879
I understand what it's like

72
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,929
to be different.

73
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,707
I'm very different too.

74
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:14,512
I mean, I don't jerk off
to little kids, but...

75
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,250
I don't know how to talk to people.

76
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,899
My dad was the only one I could talk to.

77
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,599
But he died.

78
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,460
I'm sorry to hear that.

79
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,238
- How did he pass, may I ask?
- Leukemia.

80
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:44,085
He definitely got it from
radiation at the company

81
00:04:44,086 --> 00:04:46,333
he worked at, though I couldn't prove it.

82
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:48,759
Now he's dead.

83
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:52,100
Company's fine, though.

84
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:57,970
Oh... hey.

85
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,899
It's okay, Rohit.

86
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:05,167
You don't have to worry anymore.

87
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,099
I don't understand.

88
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you blackmailing me?

89
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,778
So that's what this is about...

90
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:17,700
money.

91
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:20,837
That's all you care about, huh?

92
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:23,499
No.

93
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,366
If I pay you now,

94
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,273
you'll want more and more.

95
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:30,526
No matter how much I give.

96
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:34,899
You will inform the police anyway.

97
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,899
I won't pay you, sir.

98
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:41,239
Remember, you also broke the law.

99
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,199
Actually, you're right.

100
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,009
Partly.

101
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,782
See, I usually do this kind
of thing from my computer,

102
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,978
but this time I wanted to do it AFK.

103
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:55,899
In person.

104
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,161
Trying to work on my social anxiety.

105
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,534
But there's always the
threat of you fleeing

106
00:06:00,535 --> 00:06:01,910
after I call you out.

107
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:05,145
You'd tell your sys admin
to take your servers down,

108
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:06,446
wipe all the data.

109
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:09,938
So I made sure to include the current time

110
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:13,188
and... and location on my anonymous tip.

111
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:14,895
Wait. Hold on. I'll give you the money.

112
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:15,948
I'll pay you.

113
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,809
How much do you want? I'll pay you.

114
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:21,355
That's the part you
were wrong about, Rohit.

115
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,643
I don't give a shit about money.

116
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:38,930
Now I'm being followed.

117
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:47,268
The higher ups don't like
someone with my powers.

118
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:49,962
In three short minutes, I
destroyed a man's business,

119
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:51,437
life, existence.

120
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:53,792
- I deleted him.
- Hey!

121
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:57,467
Hey, you. Hey, kiddo.

122
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:00,713
What's happening?

123
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:08,183
Exciting time in the world right now.

124
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,151
Exciting time.

125
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:35,721
But I'm only a vigilante hacker by night.

126
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,726
By day, just a regular
cyber security engineer,

127
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:43,332
employee number ER28-0652.

128
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:46,172
Elliot!

129
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:49,181
In here.

130
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:54,199
- What's up?
- El.

131
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,772
All over the price...
Yeah, I can totally...

132
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,079
I can totally handle it.

133
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,086
They were hacked again last night.

134
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:08,115
Gideon...

135
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:09,811
That's my childhood friend Angela.

136
00:08:09,812 --> 00:08:11,834
She can be a bit high strung sometimes,

137
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:13,949
but trust me... she's one of the good ones.

138
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:15,076
What am I looking at?

139
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,608
Is this the log file?
This was a RUDY attack.

140
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:19,285
This is awesome.

141
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:20,811
- Gideon, will you answer me?
- Awesome?

142
00:08:20,812 --> 00:08:23,298
You think this is awesome?
This is killing us, Elliot.

143
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:25,817
- Gideon, I'm not...
- Angela!

144
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:28,315
Let's just see how this meeting goes today.

145
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:30,918
Their networks are getting
attacked every week.

146
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,333
Who knows if they'll
still even be a client.

147
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,632
- They're coming in?
- Hey, what did we say

148
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:39,863
about the dress code?

149
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,332
All right, now, look over those logs.

150
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,910
And be ready this afternoon in
case they have any questions.

151
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:48,185
- Okay?
- Okay.

152
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,963
- Start smoking again?
- Did you not get my texts last night?

153
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:56,323
I sent you exactly 13 of them.

154
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:58,448
Yeah, I'm sorry. I couldn't make it.

155
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:04,187
You promised me that you
were gonna try this time.

156
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,094
Stop thinking about something else

157
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:22,101
when I'm talking to you.

158
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:24,354
I hate when you do that.

159
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,564
Sorry. I was thinking about work.

160
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,899
Maybe that's why Gideon loves you so much.

161
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,899
He thanks me all the
time for bringing you in.

162
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,111
But for some reason, I think
you secretly hate it here.

163
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,899
She was right. I liked most of the people,

164
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,790
but our business, a cyber security firm

165
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:43,534
that protects corporations... I
can't think of anything I hate more.

166
00:09:43,535 --> 00:09:47,383
No, I love it here.

167
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,363
I'm sorry. I'm just in a bad mood.

168
00:09:56,699 --> 00:09:59,155
I'm late on my last two
student loan payments,

169
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:01,899
and I can't get Gideon to give me a raise.

170
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:04,599
- Hey...
- Hi.

171
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:07,761
Yo, buddy. Missed you last night.

172
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:09,907
- Where were you?
- Gotta go. Big meeting today.

173
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,978
- Did you find out what happened?
- Yeah.

174
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:17,636
He said he was working.

175
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:18,936
Oh, come on. You gotta talk to him.

176
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:20,222
We're gonna be late for the staff meeting.

177
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:23,174
He can't stand me. And you know why.

178
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:27,489
Angela, I can't have that
kind of negativity in my life.

179
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:31,899
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

180
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,899
What are you thinking about?

181
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,899
Nothing.

182
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,899
You want to know what I'm thinking about?

183
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,899
First time you came to me.

184
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,466
I didn't exactly come to Krista.

185
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:58,899
I was forced here. But I do like her.

186
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,448
Hacking her was simple.
Her password: Dylan 2791.

187
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:05,739
Favorite artist and the year in
which she was born, backwards.

188
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,710
Though she's a psychologist,

189
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:09,445
she's really bad at reading people.

190
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:11,499
But I'm good at reading people.

191
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,033
My secret: I look for the worst in them.

192
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,799
I know she went through
a divorce four years ago.

193
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,799
I know she was devastated by it

194
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,799
and has been dating losers
on eHarmony ever since.

195
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:28,099
Her most recent foray... Michael Hansen.

196
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,213
I searched for him online,
but nothing came up.

197
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:33,503
No LinkedIn, no Facebook, nothing.

198
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:35,302
Something about him bugs me,

199
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:36,945
scratching that part of my mind again.

200
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,464
But I'll hack him soon enough. I always do.

201
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,500
I know you're not yelling like before,

202
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,799
which is good.

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,999
But I can tell you're
still holding on to it.

204
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,570
And we need to work on
your anger issues, Elliot.

205
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:51,299
You're angry at everyone, at society...

206
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,261
Fuck society.

207
00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:54,399
I know you have a lot to be angry about,

208
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,158
but keeping it to yourself and
staying quiet like you're doing...

209
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,907
it's not going to help you.

210
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:03,982
There's pain underneath. That's
where our work needs to go.

211
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:11,955
What is it about society
that disappoints you so much?

212
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:20,708
Oh, I don't know.

213
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:23,581
Is it that we collectively
thought Steve Jobs

214
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:25,532
was a great man, even when we knew

215
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:29,950
he made billions off the backs of children?

216
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:34,127
Or maybe it's that it feels like
all our heroes are counterfeit.

217
00:12:34,372 --> 00:12:37,487
The world itself's just one big hoax.

218
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,543
Spamming with our running
commentary of bullshit

219
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:46,521
masquerading as insight, our
social media faking as intimacy.

220
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,210
Or is it that we voted for this?

221
00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:53,445
Not with our rigged
elections, but with our things,

222
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:55,617
our property, our money.

223
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:58,334
I'm not saying anything new.
We all know why we do this,

224
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:00,891
not because Hunger Games
books makes us happy

225
00:13:01,276 --> 00:13:03,442
but because we wanna be sedated.

226
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:05,452
Because it's painful not to pretend,

227
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:08,766
because we're cowards.

228
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:11,742
Fuck society.

229
00:13:11,743 --> 00:13:14,833
Elliot. You're not saying anything.

230
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,203
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

231
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,810
Don't be frustrated.

232
00:13:26,227 --> 00:13:30,690
- Why shouldn't I be?
- You're different than most.

233
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:34,609
You at least try.

234
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:37,829
You at least understand.

235
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:43,714
- Understand what?
- What it's like to feel alone.

236
00:13:45,696 --> 00:13:47,721
You understand the pain.

237
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:51,259
You want to protect people from it.

238
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,197
You want to protect me from it.

239
00:13:55,723 --> 00:13:58,347
I respect that about you.

240
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:04,024
Why do you think I know

241
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:08,018
- what it's like to feel alone?
- Shit! From her emails!

242
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:11,194
- Elliot?
- I don't know.

243
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,554
Let's talk about last night.

244
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:20,489
Did you go to Angela's birthday party?

245
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,751
Yeah. It was nice.

246
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:30,838
- Did you try to talk to anyone?
- Sure.

247
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:33,398
I got a girl's number.

248
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,462
You did?

249
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:37,526
She's cute.

250
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:40,622
She likes The Hunger Games.

251
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:46,996
You're hiding again, Elliot.

252
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:51,710
When you hide, your delusions come back.

253
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:54,586
It's a slippery slope.

254
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:59,685
Let's talk about the men
in black you've been seeing.

255
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:04,884
- Are they still there?
- No,

256
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,564
I... told you they're gone.

257
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:10,899
The meds you gave me are working.

258
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:17,403
Yo, man.

259
00:15:17,404 --> 00:15:19,403
Do you wanna, uh...

260
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:22,401
- you wanna do lunch today?
- Uh, yeah...

261
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:24,445
- I got other plans.
- Other plans. Right.

262
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:28,599
That's... what you said the
last three times I asked you.

263
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,594
Look, bud, you... and Angela

264
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:33,591
have been close for a long time,

265
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:36,586
and that's even more
reason why I want us to be

266
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:38,583
on good terms.

267
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:42,241
I... I just... I feel like things
have been awkward between us.

268
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:44,766
- Don't you?
- I'm okay

269
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:47,582
with it being awkward between us.

270
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:51,864
Um, yeah. I... I'm...
I'm not okay with that.

271
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:56,720
Um... look, man, I love
Angela, and I want us to...

272
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:59,682
to get along for her sake.
I mean, that's what I'm...

273
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:02,645
that's what I'm here for. I just, I...

274
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:06,149
- I don't normally do stuff...
- Am I crazy not to like this guy?

275
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:08,186
Among some of his Facebook likes

276
00:16:08,187 --> 00:16:10,167
are George W. Bush's Decision Points,

277
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:12,147
Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen,

278
00:16:12,148 --> 00:16:15,118
and the music of Josh Groban.

279
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:17,777
Must I really justify myself any further?

280
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:19,598
I'm working on that shit, you know?

281
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:24,289
His was the easiest to hack.
Password was 123456Seven.

282
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:29,188
I witnessed his first "I love
you" with Angela over Gchat,

283
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:33,650
then I witnessed the first of
many infidelities with Stella B.

284
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,585
I've never done anything
like this before...

285
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:37,903
I've thought about telling Angela,

286
00:16:37,904 --> 00:16:40,480
but she has shitty taste in
men, and I'm not quite ready

287
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:42,404
to see what comes after this just yet.

288
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:43,536
You like music. I like music.

289
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:45,565
Maroon 5.

290
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:48,244
Plus I can manage Ollie
easier than the others.

291
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:49,638
for now, anyway.

292
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:50,623
And that's all I mean.

293
00:16:50,624 --> 00:16:52,652
I just want you to know that.

294
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,082
I like you, bro, and...

295
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,112
I want you to like me too.

296
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,156
I understand.

297
00:17:00,157 --> 00:17:01,895
I'll try harder.

298
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,849
That's cool, man.

299
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,006
Hey, whenever you're
ready, I'd love to just...

300
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:10,015
chill.

301
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:14,482
Oh... forgot about your...

302
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:16,465
no touching thing.

303
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:22,721
Truth is, I shouldn't hate
Ollie; he's not that bad a guy.

304
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:24,766
He's too dumb to be bad.

305
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:29,332
In fact, when I think about
the really bad people...

306
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:35,193
E Corp, the largest
conglomerate in the world...

307
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:38,957
they're so big, they're
literally everywhere.

308
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,179
A perfect monster of modern society.

309
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,001
The E might as well stand for Evil.

310
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,606
- And all of life's necessities...
- In fact, after a thorough,

311
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:51,135
intensive self-reprogramming,
that's all my mind hears,

312
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,242
sees, or reads when
they pop up in my world.

313
00:17:53,243 --> 00:17:54,646
That was have to offer.

314
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:57,599
Together, we can change
the world, with E...

315
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,599
Evil Corp.

316
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,131
Krista would have a shit
fit if she knew I did that.

317
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:05,871
But that's what they are...
a conglomerate of evil.

318
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:09,170
- And now I have to help them.
- There are six on-site engineers

319
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,410
on your account.

320
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:13,746
- Plus a few off-site...
- There he is, Terry Colby, the CTO.

321
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,089
Even though he's the head technology guy

322
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,486
at one of the biggest companies
in the world, he owns a Blackberry.

323
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:22,396
So this is it right here.

324
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:25,117
But also looks like he doesn't
see a terminal very often

325
00:18:25,118 --> 00:18:27,451
He's not a techie. He's a moron.

326
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:32,024
An arrogant moron. The worst kind.

327
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:40,237
Oh, hi. Tyrell Wellick.

328
00:18:40,238 --> 00:18:42,634
I'm Senior Vice President, Technology.

329
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:48,527
- Elliot. Just a tech.
- Don't be so humble.

330
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:51,414
You know, I started out
exactly where you are,

331
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:54,459
and... to be honest, you
know, my heart is still there.

332
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,984
So I see you're running Gnome.

333
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,328
You know, I'm actually on KDE myself.

334
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:04,435
I know this desktop environment
is supposed to be better but...

335
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:06,424
you know what they say.

336
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:10,537
- Old habits... they die hard.
- An executive running Linux with...

337
00:19:10,538 --> 00:19:12,209
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

338
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,298
I'm an executive. I mean...

339
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:16,293
why am I even running Linux?

340
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:19,299
Again... old habits.

341
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:24,559
It's gonna be fun working with you.

342
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:28,099
I should join the rest of the group.

343
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,099
Bonsoir, Elliot.

344
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,799
Sometimes I dream of saving the world.

345
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,322
Saving everyone from the invisible hand,

346
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:49,099
one that brands us with an employee badge.

347
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:55,135
The one that forces us to work for them...

348
00:19:56,372 --> 00:20:00,021
The one that controls us every
day without us knowing it.

349
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,099
But I can't stop it.

350
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,099
I'm not that special.

351
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:10,099
I'm just anonymous.

352
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,099
I'm just alone.

353
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,888
If it weren't for Qwerty,

354
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:20,099
I'd be completely empty.

355
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,352
I hate when I can't hold in my loneliness.

356
00:20:31,237 --> 00:20:32,834
This crying has been happening too often,

357
00:20:32,835 --> 00:20:34,927
every other week now.

358
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,799
What do normal people do
when they get this sad?

359
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:46,099
They reach out to friends
or family, I think.

360
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:52,099
That's not an option.

361
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:58,099
I do morphine.

362
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,944
The key to doing morphine
without turning into a junkie

363
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:03,825
is to limit yourself
to 30 milligrams a day.

364
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:05,073
Anything more

365
00:21:05,074 --> 00:21:07,999
just builds up your tolerance.

366
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,099
I check every pill I get for purity.

367
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:14,099
I have 8 milligram Suboxone for maintenance

368
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,099
in case I go through withdrawals.

369
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,099
Shit! I'm out again.

370
00:21:22,474 --> 00:21:26,393
- How much?
- On the house.

371
00:21:26,694 --> 00:21:29,799
No, Shayla. Not doing that.

372
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,399
Okay? This is just a regular drug deal

373
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,399
- like it always is.
- Fine.

374
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,134
So what are you you to tonight?

375
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:38,099
'Cause I tried to post
something on your Facebook

376
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,759
and couldn't find you.

377
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,627
I'm not on Facebook.

378
00:21:41,628 --> 00:21:45,239
- What? Why not?
- 'Cause I hate Facebook.

379
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,099
That's crazy.

380
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,779
Well... you want to do these together then?

381
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:57,800
Pure Molly...

382
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,430
Don't ever make decisions
when you're on morphine.

383
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:27,499
Instagram check-in for
Krista at Pierre Loti.

384
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,113
Okay, Michael Hansen.

385
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,557
Time to find out who you really are.

386
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,499
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

387
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,399
Taxi!

388
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:35,399
Uh, hi... I just left my
keys in one of your cabs.

389
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,399
56Y2.

390
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:39,699
Sure.

391
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,799
What about you two? Huh?

392
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:47,399
You guys got any spare change?

393
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:49,798
Help me out?

394
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,999
New York's expensive, guys. Come on.

395
00:23:53,335 --> 00:23:56,099
306 Hawthorne. Thank you. Thank you.

396
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,600
Come on, asshole. Piss already.

397
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:22,180
Come on!

398
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:23,799
Come on! Will you... will you go?

399
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,025
- Come on, go, go!
- Hey!

400
00:24:25,326 --> 00:24:26,613
Go, will ya?

401
00:24:26,614 --> 00:24:28,100
Hey.

402
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:33,099
May I borrow your phone?

403
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,099
Mine's dead. I need to call my mom.

404
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:44,499
Thank you.

405
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,599
No answer. Thanks anyway.

406
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:27,973
- Angela, is everything okay?
- I need you to come to AllSafe.

407
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,273
You're there? It's 3:00 in the morning.

408
00:25:30,274 --> 00:25:33,359
They attacked Evil Corp servers
again, but it's bad this time.

409
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,200
It's a DDoS attack.

410
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:37,977
- Did you call Lloyd? He's on call.
- Yeah, he's here.

411
00:25:38,696 --> 00:25:42,784
- Is he talking to their tech department?
- He's online with them, but so far nothing.

412
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:47,231
I don't think that Lloyd can handle this.

413
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,002
Look, Gideon just put me on this account.

414
00:25:50,003 --> 00:25:51,672
I can't screw up in my first week.

415
00:25:51,673 --> 00:25:54,299
I need you. Please.

416
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,541
I'll be right there.

417
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:11,307
- Finally!
- Calm down... it's only been an hour.

418
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:16,126
Yeah, well, an hour in Evil Corp time is
like $13 million in revenue, approximately.

419
00:26:16,127 --> 00:26:17,761
Actually, I calculated that.

420
00:26:17,762 --> 00:26:19,773
That's exactly how much they lost.

421
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:22,026
Don't worry. I got you.

422
00:26:22,962 --> 00:26:24,399
Lloyd, what's up?

423
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,399
Lloyd!

424
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:29,486
Elliot. This is bad.

425
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,068
Worst DDoS attack I've ever seen.

426
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:33,641
- Did you reconfigure the DNS?
- Yes!

427
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:35,883
- Stop the services.
- I already stopped the services,

428
00:26:35,884 --> 00:26:38,260
tries to reboot the servers
but they're not coming back up.

429
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:41,515
Dude, someone is straight up fingerblasting
their entire network right now.

430
00:26:58,713 --> 00:27:01,182
They just started reporting on the outage.

431
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:11,675
Shit. This is worse than I
thought. They're in the network?

432
00:27:11,676 --> 00:27:13,618
What's the status update?

433
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:16,123
He's here. I thought we
set up security protocols

434
00:27:16,124 --> 00:27:19,519
so that this doesn't happen.

435
00:27:19,844 --> 00:27:21,888
- Where's the attack coming from?
- Everywhere, obviously.

436
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:25,310
- The USA, Finland, Thailand, Kuwait...
- Start restarting the services, load sharing,

437
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,448
redirect the traffic.
Call Prolexic for help.

438
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:31,734
- Wait. What?
- I don't think this is just a DDoS attack.

439
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:36,146
I think they got a rootkit
sitting inside the servers.

440
00:27:36,472 --> 00:27:39,027
- What's a rootkit?
- It's like a crazy serial

441
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:40,499
rapist with a very big dick.

442
00:27:40,903 --> 00:27:44,487
- Jesus, Lloyd.
- Sorry. It's malicious code that completely

443
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:47,061
takes over their system.
It can delete system files

444
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:49,594
and stop programs. Viruses, worms...

445
00:27:49,595 --> 00:27:51,302
- How do we stop it?
- That's the thing.

446
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,445
It's fundamentally
invisible... you can't stop it.

447
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:54,819
All of their servers are timing out.

448
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,134
None of them are coming back up.

449
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,243
That's because every
time we restart the server

450
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:00,205
the virus replicates itself during boot up

451
00:28:00,206 --> 00:28:01,342
and crashes the host.

452
00:28:01,343 --> 00:28:02,510
_

453
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:04,382
How are we supposed to bring up the network

454
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:08,184
- if we can't restart the servers?
- We can't.

455
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:11,399
Which is what they wanted.

456
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:14,891
By defending ourselves, we ended
up spreading the virus everywhere.

457
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,098
Only thing we can do

458
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:19,399
is we've gotta take the
whole system offline,

459
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,428
wipe the infected servers
clean, then bring them back up.

460
00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:26,399
You're coming with me.

461
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,374
- Yeah.
- Lloyd.

462
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,602
Tell everybody to start
taking everything offline.

463
00:28:30,603 --> 00:28:33,320
- On it.
- Uh, the server farm in Dulles.

464
00:28:33,321 --> 00:28:34,924
We're gonna need the jet.

465
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,245
They're booting the network back up.

466
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:53,067
Now, you're downloading
the logs, right because...

467
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:55,009
- Stop. Tell him to stop.
- What?

468
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,299
Don't start the boot
sequence. You guys missed one.

469
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,064
There's an infected server up and running.

470
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:02,999
What's the ETA before it hits this server?

471
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:10,699
The backup server up and running?

472
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,473
It's ready, but it's not
configured for auto switch.

473
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:21,905
We need to redirect the
traffic, need to switch DNS.

474
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:27,961
You got this, you got this, you got this.

475
00:29:29,615 --> 00:29:32,552
- This is impossible.
- You got this, you got this, you got this.

476
00:29:33,174 --> 00:29:35,523
It's almost at the back server!

477
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,500
We still up?

478
00:29:52,322 --> 00:29:55,994
We're okay.

479
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:59,237
Yeah.

480
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:08,825
Hank.

481
00:30:08,826 --> 00:30:10,627
I'm gonna take a look at
the infected server, okay?

482
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:14,906
- Give me a minute.
- Yeah. Uh... I'll meet you at the elevators.

483
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:22,935
They must have left a mark or something.

484
00:30:22,936 --> 00:30:24,852
Every hacker loves attention.

485
00:30:24,853 --> 00:30:27,579
They don't just do DDoS
attacks for no reason.

486
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:36,726
This is it. Fsociety.

487
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:39,199
Is that supposed to be a joke?

488
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,571
This was way too easy. They
didn't hide it well at all.

489
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:46,183
_

490
00:30:47,058 --> 00:30:49,289
_

491
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:52,585
This note is for me.

492
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:55,985
They're telling me to leave it here.

493
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:59,252
But why? Doesn't matter.

494
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:01,476
Time to shut them down.

495
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:06,668
Why can't I delete it?

496
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:09,181
I don't want to delete
it. I want it to stay.

497
00:31:09,182 --> 00:31:11,399
What's wrong with me?

498
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,835
I'll reconfigure the
access to the root directory

499
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:24,057
so only I can use it. And no one will know.

500
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,802
For you, sir.

501
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,402
- Did you know that I'm gay?
- Uh...

502
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,431
- No.
- Hmm.

503
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:53,299
Consider this me coming
out to you then, okay?

504
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:55,899
It's hard because I don't
like to talk about my sex life.

505
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,899
But my partner, he gets very paranoid.

506
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,899
He thinks I'm ashamed of...

507
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,899
He wants me to be more public about it, so,

508
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,899
Anyway, I'm gay.

509
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,599
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

510
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:24,107
Hey, man, don't worry about it.

511
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,199
Hackers have a short attention span.

512
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,929
They'll get bored, harass someone else.

513
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:33,999
Evil Corp is thinking about leaving us.

514
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,136
And I don't know if I can blame them.

515
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,833
They could have called
their other security teams.

516
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,784
- Mm.
- They called you.

517
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:46,900
Well, somebody over there likes us,

518
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:49,836
but Terry Colby, he's getting the pressure.

519
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:53,822
and he calls the shots.

520
00:32:53,823 --> 00:32:56,999
Evil Corp is 80% of our business.

521
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,999
If we lose them, it's gonna be it for us.

522
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,905
It's gonna be it...

523
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,999
For me.

524
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,602
I feel like I can talk to you.

525
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,945
I mean, more than the others, anyway.

526
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:25,398
I'm sure, in a weird way,
you'll be happy if we went under.

527
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:28,580
Oh, come on. Come on.

528
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,673
I know you hate wearing
those stupid shirts.

529
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:43,999
Gideon?

530
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:49,199
I promise I'll find them.

531
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,974
Evil Corp service should
be back up soon enough.

532
00:34:04,975 --> 00:34:07,955
I'll take a look at the dat
file. I'll ask my IRC contacts

533
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:09,749
about fsociety when I get home.

534
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,806
I've never seen their
name on the boards though.

535
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:13,999
They've gotta be new, but they're good.

536
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:22,999
Rough night?

537
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:30,619
I'm getting off here.

538
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:33,799
I think you should come with me.

539
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,999
But only if you didn't delete it.

540
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,572
You deleted it, we got
nothing to talk about.

541
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:43,861
Are you talking to me?

542
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:50,251
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

543
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:07,629
- Who are you?
- We gotta wait for the Q.

544
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:19,019
- Then what?
- Then we're going to Brooklyn.

545
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,835
Out by Coney Island.

546
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,675
Why?

547
00:35:24,348 --> 00:35:28,525
What's there?

548
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:32,999
Obviously you're gonna
ask a lot of questions.

549
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,973
It's weird what you're
doing right now, I get it.

550
00:35:37,899 --> 00:35:40,899
I... I can't tell you
anything until we get there.

551
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:51,113
Can't smoke in here.

552
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:57,885
You've been following me.

553
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:00,653
Why?

554
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:05,799
What do you want from me?

555
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:12,799
My dad was a petty thief.

556
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,799
Never could hold down a job.

557
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,053
So, he just robbed,
convenience stores, shops,

558
00:36:18,054 --> 00:36:20,123
small-time stuff.

559
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:23,649
One time, he sat me down, he
told me something I never forgot.

560
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:28,511
He said, "Everyone steals.
That's how it works.

561
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:32,645
You think people out there are
getting exactly what they deserve? No.

562
00:36:32,646 --> 00:36:34,799
They're getting paid over or under,

563
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,188
but someone in the chain
always gets bamboozled.

564
00:36:40,395 --> 00:36:44,799
I steal, son, but I don't get caught.

565
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,799
That's my contract with society.

566
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,799
Now if you can catch me
stealing, I'll go to jail.

567
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,496
But if you can't, then
I've earned the money."

568
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:00,518
I respected that, man.

569
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:07,035
I thought that shit was
cool as a little kid.

570
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,799
A few years after that,

571
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,799
they finally caught him.

572
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,864
Sent him to jail.

573
00:37:17,865 --> 00:37:22,075
Dies five years later.
My respect goes with him.

574
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:28,656
I thought he was free doing
what he did, but he wasn't.

575
00:37:30,253 --> 00:37:32,465
He was in prison.

576
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:36,651
Just like you are now, Elliot.

577
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:41,799
But I'm gonna break you out.

578
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:43,632
- Why would you guys actually meet IRL?
- You remember that hacker group O-Megz?

579
00:38:43,633 --> 00:38:45,474
They got outed by their
own leader to the FBI,

580
00:38:45,475 --> 00:38:47,167
and six hackers went to prison for it?

581
00:38:47,168 --> 00:38:48,630
You know how they got 'em?

582
00:38:48,631 --> 00:38:50,195
They went on the dude's computer,

583
00:38:50,196 --> 00:38:55,813
tracked 'em all down through emails,
VPN sessions, chat messages, texts.

584
00:38:55,814 --> 00:38:57,799
One guy, and the whole thing comes down.

585
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,919
- It's what's called...
- A central point of failure.

586
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,285
Right. Because they
refused to meet in person,

587
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:07,241
they compromised each other every time
they sent so much as a smiley face.

588
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:11,864
The rule here is, it's
done here, and only here.

589
00:39:13,799 --> 00:39:17,202
It ends when you walk out that
door, and begins when you walk in.

590
00:39:17,203 --> 00:39:21,241
Our encryption is the real world.

591
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:24,862
- How do you talk to each other then?
- We don't.

592
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,783
We come and go, work on
the project when we can.

593
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,799
- How do you trust them?
- I give them an exercise.

594
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,791
If they pass, they join us.

595
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,684
- If they fail...
- The DDoS attack last night,

596
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:42,569
you were testing me.

597
00:39:49,384 --> 00:39:51,518
You said there was a project.

598
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:55,066
- What's the project?
- That'll come later.

599
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:57,428
I just wanted you to see the place.

600
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:06,099
There's not much you can do without a CPU.

601
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:12,456
I'm crazy.

602
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:15,099
I have to be crazy because
that didn't just happen, right?

603
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,113
This is a delusion. Is this a
delusion? Shit, I'm a schizo.

604
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:24,173
Have I really lost it this time?
No, no. Last night happened.

605
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:26,538
It was real. Angela called
me. I was at AllSafe.

606
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:28,099
Evil Corp's servers were compromised.

607
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,099
Those are facts, not delusions.

608
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,708
I know. I know, I know I
realize I'm saying all of this

609
00:40:32,709 --> 00:40:36,157
to an imaginary person, but I created you.

610
00:40:36,158 --> 00:40:38,593
I didn't create this.

611
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:41,281
Oh, thank God you're here.

612
00:40:41,282 --> 00:40:43,927
I was just about to go
wait in the Starbucks.

613
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:46,282
You live in a bad neighborhood.

614
00:40:46,283 --> 00:40:48,936
- Do you know that?
- I do know that.

615
00:40:49,499 --> 00:40:54,249
Do you want to get high and
watch your favorite movie?

616
00:40:55,099 --> 00:40:58,711
Oh, you saved our asses last night. I
thought Gideon was definitely gonna fire me.

617
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:01,229
Where have you been?

618
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:07,072
- I thought you'd be sleeping.
- I... yeah, I fell asleep on the train.

619
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,664
That sounds like such a lie,

620
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:15,870
but, whatever. I don't want
to get into that right now.

621
00:41:16,171 --> 00:41:18,254
So you want to do this?

622
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,939
I miss Qwerty. I hope she still loves me.

623
00:41:34,899 --> 00:41:36,899
Shit.

624
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,072
She wasn't supposed to be here, okay?

625
00:41:39,073 --> 00:41:42,131
- Give me a minute and I'll get rid of her.
- That's okay.

626
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:46,051
Um... This is great.

627
00:41:46,801 --> 00:41:49,097
- Elliot, I'm happy for you.
- No, it's not like that.

628
00:41:49,098 --> 00:41:53,640
Well, maybe it should be, you
know? It's good that you're...

629
00:41:55,799 --> 00:41:57,664
dating.

630
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:02,233
Well, I'll see you on Monday.

631
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:04,699
We can do movie night next time.

632
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,417
- I promise, okay?
- Yeah.

633
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,106
Have fun.

634
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:33,475
Mm, Elliot?

635
00:42:34,091 --> 00:42:38,872
Oh, shit. Is it Wednesday?

636
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:41,940
- Shayla.
- I have to move my car.

637
00:42:41,941 --> 00:42:45,857
Shayla, leave.

638
00:42:48,216 --> 00:42:49,699
Now.

639
00:42:53,052 --> 00:42:54,870
No mention of Mr. Robot anywhere.

640
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:56,699
No mention of fsociety.

641
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,216
Not on any of the hacker boards.

642
00:42:58,217 --> 00:43:02,111
Not on IRC, forums, blogs,
no one's heard of them.

643
00:43:06,014 --> 00:43:10,079
Property was owned by Fun Society
Amusement, LLC for 13 years.

644
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:12,939
Owner was shot a killed
a year and a half ago.

645
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,415
No owner since.

646
00:43:14,716 --> 00:43:18,099
And the ownership history before
that is sparse to nonexistent.

647
00:43:18,499 --> 00:43:21,633
This guy is good. Very good.

648
00:43:27,009 --> 00:43:31,235
Doesn't matter. Their arcade
network's IP is in the DAT file.

649
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:37,509
That'll be enough to turn them in.

650
00:43:51,799 --> 00:43:53,799
What's your ask, Mr. Robot?

651
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:06,792
Hey, man,

652
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:12,341
- where's your boss?
- Okay, cut the bullshit.

653
00:44:12,629 --> 00:44:15,728
When are you going to give us
access to the root directory?

654
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:19,107
What? Dude, come on.

655
00:44:19,108 --> 00:44:20,699
I wrote that rootkit.

656
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,699
I still have to put
Colby's IP in the DAT file.

657
00:44:29,899 --> 00:44:31,783
Dickhead.

658
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,051
Elliot! Good news.

659
00:44:36,052 --> 00:44:38,108
I scored the last bag of
Twinkies from Gristedes.

660
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:42,093
- You want one?
- She just called me a dickhead.

661
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:45,466
Yeah, that's Darlene.

662
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:49,479
Hey, you like Ferris wheels?

663
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:54,762
Ah, it's beautiful.

664
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:57,245
Gets better the higher up you go, you know?

665
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:01,699
Oh, I love it up here.

666
00:45:02,275 --> 00:45:07,383
- You like it?
- I'm here to tell you I'm turning you in.

667
00:45:08,031 --> 00:45:11,554
- I'm giving them all the information.
- Let me tell you why you're really here.

668
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:16,208
You're here because you sense
something wrong with the world.

669
00:45:16,209 --> 00:45:18,768
Something you can't explain.

670
00:45:19,277 --> 00:45:20,860
But...

671
00:45:20,861 --> 00:45:23,619
you know it controls you
and everyone you care about.

672
00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:26,606
What are you talking about?

673
00:45:29,553 --> 00:45:31,293
Money.

674
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,472
Money hasn't been real since
we got off the gold standard.

675
00:45:35,473 --> 00:45:37,144
It's become virtual.

676
00:45:37,145 --> 00:45:40,823
Software. The operating
system of our world.

677
00:45:41,502 --> 00:45:47,052
And, Elliot, we are on the verge
of taking down this virtual reality.

678
00:45:49,448 --> 00:45:50,985
Think about it.

679
00:45:51,534 --> 00:45:55,734
What if you could take
down one conglomerate?

680
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:59,731
A conglomerate so deeply entrenched

681
00:45:59,732 --> 00:46:04,478
in the world's economy, that
too big to fail to describing it.

682
00:46:05,068 --> 00:46:07,545
You want to create
another financial meltdown

683
00:46:07,546 --> 00:46:11,117
like the one we just had, but way worse.

684
00:46:11,118 --> 00:46:12,812
Yeah, why would I want that?

685
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:14,458
Everyone would lose their money.

686
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:16,540
What if I told you that this conglomerate

687
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:20,210
just so happens to own 70% of the
global consumer credit industry?

688
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:22,786
Huh? If we hit their
data center just right,

689
00:46:22,787 --> 00:46:25,119
we could systematically
format all the servers,

690
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,229
- including backup.
- That would erase all...

691
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,450
All the debt we owe them.

692
00:46:29,451 --> 00:46:32,628
Every record of every credit
card, loan, and mortgage

693
00:46:32,629 --> 00:46:34,091
would be wiped clean.

694
00:46:35,162 --> 00:46:36,393
It would be impossible to reinforce

695
00:46:36,395 --> 00:46:37,858
outdated paper records.

696
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,888
It would all be gone.

697
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:43,487
The single biggest incident

698
00:46:43,489 --> 00:46:47,550
of wealth redistribution in history.

699
00:46:53,147 --> 00:46:57,408
Evil Corp. The conglomerate.

700
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:59,306
That's why you picked me.

701
00:46:59,308 --> 00:47:00,872
Because I work at AllSafe.

702
00:47:00,874 --> 00:47:04,036
Tomorrow, AllSafe is going to get a visit

703
00:47:04,038 --> 00:47:08,099
from the FBI and the U.S. Cyber Command.

704
00:47:08,101 --> 00:47:12,529
You are going to modify the DAT file

705
00:47:12,531 --> 00:47:17,358
and put Colby's terminal
IP address in there.

706
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,989
Terry Colby?

707
00:47:19,991 --> 00:47:24,119
You're gonna frame him? No
one's gonna believe that.

708
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:26,416
I met him, he's a moron.

709
00:47:26,418 --> 00:47:28,282
So are the FBI.

710
00:47:28,284 --> 00:47:30,014
Even if they don't believe he did it,

711
00:47:30,016 --> 00:47:33,411
they'll believe he gave
someone access to it.

712
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:34,977
Yeah, he'll just go to jail.

713
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:37,875
- What good will that do?
- You don't take down a conglomerate

714
00:47:37,876 --> 00:47:39,806
by shooting them in the heart.

715
00:47:39,808 --> 00:47:41,371
That's the thing about conglomerates,

716
00:47:41,373 --> 00:47:43,369
they don't have hearts.

717
00:47:43,371 --> 00:47:46,134
You take them down limb by limb.

718
00:47:46,136 --> 00:47:47,533
And as they unravel,

719
00:47:47,535 --> 00:47:50,797
their illusion of control unravels.

720
00:47:56,793 --> 00:48:01,705
- Who are you?
- That'll come later.

721
00:48:01,756 --> 00:48:06,383
Right now, you have a lot to think about.

722
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:09,014
You have to change the DAT file

723
00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:12,078
and put Colby's IP in there.

724
00:48:14,745 --> 00:48:17,274
You do that,

725
00:48:17,276 --> 00:48:19,439
you have set in motion
the largest revolution

726
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:22,803
the world will ever see.

727
00:50:55,283 --> 00:51:00,837
- So, what do we got?
- So, if you'll take a look

728
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:02,335
at the first page of your agenda...

729
00:51:02,337 --> 00:51:05,799
You're the one who stopped the hack.

730
00:51:05,801 --> 00:51:08,896
You know, the gals in analysis
said this was a tough one.

731
00:51:08,898 --> 00:51:10,329
All things being equal,

732
00:51:10,331 --> 00:51:12,893
it should have shut us down for days, so...

733
00:51:12,895 --> 00:51:15,324
you did good.

734
00:51:15,326 --> 00:51:18,854
Okay.

735
00:51:18,856 --> 00:51:22,252
We should start with our
account executive, Angela.

736
00:51:22,254 --> 00:51:24,050
Okay, we first noticed the breach

737
00:51:24,052 --> 00:51:28,047
at 2:07 A.M. Eastern
Standard on Friday night.

738
00:51:28,454 --> 00:51:32,463
- You mean, Saturday?
- Sorry, yes,

739
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,478
technically, Saturday morning.

740
00:51:34,479 --> 00:51:37,005
Yeah, okay, Angela,
that's what we're here for.

741
00:51:37,007 --> 00:51:39,304
The technicals.

742
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:41,425
Right.

743
00:51:42,101 --> 00:51:45,681
Yes. Anyway, he arrived at the office

744
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:47,807
- at 2:35 and I instru...
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

745
00:51:48,808 --> 00:51:50,439
So that's almost a half hour
after the initial breach.

746
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,279
Why didn't anyone pipe
in from their laptops?

747
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,558
- It's not protocol...
- It wouldn't have been secure

748
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,955
if someone terminaled in on this.

749
00:51:57,957 --> 00:52:01,652
It was the smarter move
to have someone come in

750
00:52:01,654 --> 00:52:04,611
- so they can log in on a secure line.
- Exactly.

751
00:52:04,612 --> 00:52:06,924
- Then Lloyd was able to...
- Just... just actually,

752
00:52:06,925 --> 00:52:08,838
just one second.

753
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,175
Yeah.

754
00:52:21,937 --> 00:52:24,033
You know, I, uh,

755
00:52:24,035 --> 00:52:28,062
I always loved this view.

756
00:52:42,919 --> 00:52:45,082
Now that that's taken care of,

757
00:52:45,084 --> 00:52:47,846
let's pick it up where we left off.

758
00:52:47,848 --> 00:52:49,144
What happened to Angela?

759
00:52:49,146 --> 00:52:50,977
She knows more about what happened.

760
00:52:50,979 --> 00:52:53,175
She's not going to work out
for us, not on this level.

761
00:52:53,177 --> 00:52:55,931
We need to stick to the
more tech savvy here.

762
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:01,435
Now, let's get to the heart of this thing

763
00:53:01,437 --> 00:53:03,567
because I can't sit here

764
00:53:03,569 --> 00:53:06,784
and look through a packet
for the next 20 minutes.

765
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:11,378
All right, just who did
this? Is it that hard?

766
00:53:12,161 --> 00:53:17,631
- Who did this?
- I found the configuration file

767
00:53:17,632 --> 00:53:20,248
of the rootkit with a
pattern of IP addresses.

768
00:53:23,585 --> 00:53:28,113
Once you decrypt it, you'll
know where the hack came from.

769
00:53:38,043 --> 00:53:40,224
19 days.

770
00:53:43,805 --> 00:53:47,289
No news, no arrests, no revolution.

771
00:53:59,658 --> 00:54:03,720
No FBI, Colby, Evil Corp.

772
00:54:06,497 --> 00:54:09,805
_

773
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:20,638
No Mr. Robot.

774
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,704
No fsociety.

775
00:54:30,765 --> 00:54:33,828
I need to take my mind off things.

776
00:54:43,854 --> 00:54:46,470
- Hello.
- Hi, this is Sam

777
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:48,915
from Bank of E security fraud department.

778
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:50,813
Unfortunately I have to inform you

779
00:54:50,815 --> 00:54:52,612
that your account's been compromised.

780
00:54:53,614 --> 00:54:56,891
- What? What happened?
- First before I can answer any questions,

781
00:54:56,892 --> 00:54:58,487
I need to verify some information.

782
00:54:58,488 --> 00:55:02,922
- Are you still at 306 Hawthorne Avenue?
- Yes. Apartment 2C.

783
00:55:02,923 --> 00:55:05,092
- _
- Great. And your security question,

784
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:08,493
- favorite baseball team?
- Um, Yankees.

785
00:55:08,494 --> 00:55:10,098
I don't remember this
being a security question.

786
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:13,682
- And lastly, your pet's name?
- Um, Flipper.

787
00:55:13,683 --> 00:55:17,457
Who am I speaking to? Can
I get your name and number?

788
00:55:17,459 --> 00:55:19,789
With those details plus a
dictionary brute-force attack,

789
00:55:19,791 --> 00:55:23,985
it'll take my program maybe two
minutes to crack his password.

790
00:55:31,614 --> 00:55:34,809
What I wouldn't give to be normal.

791
00:55:34,811 --> 00:55:37,873
To live in that bubble,

792
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:40,671
the reality of the naive.

793
00:55:44,137 --> 00:55:49,031
That's how I justify this.

794
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:52,129
To keep their optimism intact.

795
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:55,592
To protect them.

796
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,339
_

797
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,528
How? He's too old to have
a complicated password.

798
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:04,452
It had to have been a
combination of these things.

799
00:56:08,051 --> 00:56:09,514
I'm missing something,
I'm missing something,

800
00:56:09,516 --> 00:56:13,944
I'm missing something.

801
00:56:13,946 --> 00:56:15,609
Michael Hansen isn't his real name.

802
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,933
Come on. Get over here.

803
00:56:30,032 --> 00:56:31,462
Lenny Shannon?

804
00:56:31,464 --> 00:56:34,060
Michael Hansen?

805
00:56:34,062 --> 00:56:37,524
Which one are you playing tonight?

806
00:56:37,526 --> 00:56:40,043
- You're going to stop seeing Krista.
- What the f...

807
00:56:41,044 --> 00:56:43,333
You're going to break up with her.
You're never going to see her again.

808
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:47,349
You're the guy that used my phone.

809
00:56:47,351 --> 00:56:49,780
You cheated on your current
wife with seven different women.

810
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:51,782
I got digital proof of all of it.

811
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:55,708
Ashley Madison, online
escorts, fake Facebook pages.

812
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,873
I own it all.

813
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:59,772
And if you don't stop seeing her,

814
00:56:59,774 --> 00:57:03,901
your wife will know everything
along with the police.

815
00:57:03,903 --> 00:57:07,126
- The police?
- Yeah, one of the escorts was 15.

816
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:12,536
That 15 part I made up,

817
00:57:12,537 --> 00:57:14,592
but he did have a
proclivity for young escorts

818
00:57:14,594 --> 00:57:15,924
that helped the lie.

819
00:57:15,926 --> 00:57:18,455
But I'm not gonna do any of that

820
00:57:18,457 --> 00:57:20,987
as long as you break up with Krista.

821
00:57:20,989 --> 00:57:23,052
Tonight.

822
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:29,946
Done.

823
00:57:29,948 --> 00:57:32,111
You're also gonna tell her the truth.

824
00:57:32,113 --> 00:57:34,142
That you're married, cheat on your wife,

825
00:57:34,144 --> 00:57:36,407
you hire hookers.

826
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:39,537
That you never had any intention
of being serious with her.

827
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,970
Why?

828
00:57:40,972 --> 00:57:42,069
That would destroy her.

829
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:44,400
She thinks that...

830
00:57:44,402 --> 00:57:46,366
We're in love.

831
00:57:46,368 --> 00:57:48,896
Exactly. Krista needs to
avoid dickheads like you

832
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:50,062
in the future.

833
00:57:50,064 --> 00:57:52,626
Her radar needs fixing.

834
00:57:52,628 --> 00:57:55,558
I'll know if you skip any detail.

835
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:59,721
So don't.

836
00:57:59,723 --> 00:58:02,685
And one more thing...

837
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:05,615
I'm gonna need something from you.

838
00:58:09,481 --> 00:58:11,478
Come on.

839
00:58:22,403 --> 00:58:26,698
Hmm. I like you, Flipper.

840
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,961
You're cool.

841
00:58:29,963 --> 00:58:32,061
I never want to be right about my hacks,

842
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,825
but people always find a way to disappoint.

843
00:58:42,154 --> 00:58:45,816
Michael Hansen now gets
filed away among the others.

844
00:58:45,818 --> 00:58:48,181
Forever buried in my digital cemetery.

845
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:59,404
The look of disillusionment.

846
00:58:59,406 --> 00:59:01,968
He told her. She cried all night.

847
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:04,067
Now comes the sadness.

848
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:06,495
I don't like seeing her sad.

849
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:13,259
- You okay?
- Sorry.

850
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:14,962
Sorry.

851
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:20,054
Go on.

852
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,352
I think Angela blames me for what happened

853
00:59:22,354 --> 00:59:24,816
at the Evil Corp meeting.

854
00:59:24,818 --> 00:59:27,148
What do I do? I need to talk to her.

855
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:30,445
I think you just answered
your own question.

856
00:59:30,447 --> 00:59:32,044
Talk to her.

857
00:59:32,046 --> 00:59:34,672
She won't respond to any
of my texts or emails.

858
00:59:34,673 --> 00:59:36,773
Then go to her in person.

859
00:59:36,775 --> 00:59:39,937
Tell her you need to talk.

860
00:59:39,939 --> 00:59:43,301
Communication is key, Elliot.

861
00:59:43,303 --> 00:59:48,563
Real human interaction.

862
00:59:48,565 --> 00:59:51,260
That's what's important for you right now.

863
01:00:01,587 --> 01:00:04,949
Hey. Do you...

864
01:00:04,951 --> 01:00:07,214
- Do you think we can talk?
- What?

865
01:00:07,216 --> 01:00:08,812
You won't talk to me.

866
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:10,211
You haven't talked to me since the meeting.

867
01:00:10,213 --> 01:00:11,709
I don't want to talk to you

868
01:00:11,711 --> 01:00:15,073
because I feel embarrassed

869
01:00:15,075 --> 01:00:17,171
every time I think about what happened.

870
01:00:17,173 --> 01:00:19,037
Okay?

871
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:22,067
It's fine. I'll get over it.

872
01:00:22,069 --> 01:00:24,002
- It's been three weeks.
- I have to get back to work.

873
01:00:24,003 --> 01:00:26,759
- You're just going to ignore me?
- You didn't have to stick up for me in there.

874
01:00:27,732 --> 01:00:29,161
I know that you were just trying to help,

875
01:00:29,163 --> 01:00:32,792
just don't do it again.

876
01:00:32,794 --> 01:00:34,624
Even if I'm losing.

877
01:00:34,626 --> 01:00:37,491
Let me lose, okay?

878
01:00:39,122 --> 01:00:41,684
Don't look confused.

879
01:00:41,686 --> 01:00:44,815
Just say it.

880
01:00:44,817 --> 01:00:47,066
"Okay."

881
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,772
Okay.

882
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:08,761
Elliott.

883
01:01:26,148 --> 01:01:29,910
FBI agents claim that Colby
either used hacking groups

884
01:01:29,911 --> 01:01:31,827
or worked in conjunction with them

885
01:01:31,828 --> 01:01:35,173
to pressure Evil Corp during
his contract negotiations.

886
01:01:35,175 --> 01:01:38,003
After a long and exhaustive investigation,

887
01:01:38,005 --> 01:01:42,234
sources close to the FBI
have confirmed the hacks were

888
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:45,830
in part tied to Colby's terminal.

889
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:52,625
It's happening, it's happening,
it's happening, it's happening.

890
01:02:01,286 --> 01:02:03,349
It's happening, it's happening,
it's happening, it's happening.

891
01:02:20,304 --> 01:02:24,365
Sir, step inside the car.

892
01:02:27,997 --> 01:02:29,594
Sir.

893
01:02:33,426 --> 01:02:35,822
Step inside the vehicle now.

894
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:09,227
Go ahead.

895
01:03:09,229 --> 01:03:11,292
Sir, go on in.

896
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:17,053
Sir, go on in.

897
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:13,006
Bonsoir, Elliot.

898
01:04:14,841 --> 01:04:17,137
Please tell me you're seeing this, too.

899
01:04:18,852 --> 01:04:23,107

1
00:00:01,305 --> 00:00:03,770
Exciting time in the world right now.

2
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:06,045
<i>Some believe there are
alternate realities</i>

3
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:07,466
<i>with other lives that we're leading.</i>

5
00:00:08,413 --> 00:00:10,435
_

6
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:12,207
<i>How many copies of ourselves exist,</i>

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,586
<i>and might our mental
states be conjoined?</i>

8
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:16,877
<i>Zhang's machine, he built it under</i>

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,047
<i>the Washington Township Power Plant.</i>

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,978
<i>26 employees died from Leukemia.</i>

11
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:25,546
I have been trying to ship
my project to the Congo.

12
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:28,464
I want you to destroy
Whiterose's machine.

13
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:30,964
<i>Sometimes I dream of saving the world.</i>

14
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:32,921
<i>Do you ever think that
if you imagine something,</i>

15
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:34,102
<i>it would come true?</i>

16
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:36,581
<i>It happened. It actually happened.</i>

17
00:00:36,584 --> 00:00:38,289
Are you sure you don't
wanna come with us?

18
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:40,729
I can't. I'm not done.

19
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:42,225
Where did the Dark Army go?

20
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:45,563
Your dream is as good as dead.

21
00:00:49,822 --> 00:00:52,063

<i>Three, two, one!</i>

25
00:02:36,562 --> 00:02:39,396
You were looking for Minister Zhang?

26
00:02:39,398 --> 00:02:41,398
He isn't here.

27
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,992
He's dead.

28
00:02:45,738 --> 00:02:48,164
There is only Whiterose.

30
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:18,027
Any advice for a road trip?

31
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:19,695
I've never been on one before.

32
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,108
Neither have I.

33
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:30,281
Recommend getting a
bunch of Sour Patch Kids.

34
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:43,711
I've been through a lot, Darlene.

35
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:57,900
Thank you for never giving up on me.

36
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:16,585
I should get going.

37
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:24,501
We really pulled this off, didn't we?

38
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:30,174
Fuck yeah, we did.

39
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:44,688
You know, you really
started to grow on me

40
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:46,690
ever since you stopped
being such a dickhead.

41
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,542
Please tell me you're
not really doing this.

42
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:07,544
From what I saw on that drive,

43
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:08,637
I can make the software

44
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,265
on Whiterose's machine
completely unusable.

45
00:05:12,694 --> 00:05:14,317
It will shut it down for good.

46
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,447
You mean the machine

47
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,075
that's in a goddamn nuclear power plant?

48
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:20,557
We fuck up, this will cause a meltdown.

49
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:24,153
The right malware can corrupt
the machine's entire system.

50
00:05:24,155 --> 00:05:25,896
It won't even be able to start.

51
00:05:25,898 --> 00:05:28,232
It would take decades
for them to recode it.

52
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:30,651
No! We're done, remember?

53
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:32,236
This is what we agreed to.

54
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:34,071
That's what last night was.

55
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:35,739
The last step.

56
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:38,242
We stick with the plan, we leave.

57
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:40,119
Besides, it would take you forever

58
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,962
to write that malware anyway.

59
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:52,014
You've already written it, haven't you?

60
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:56,018
It wasn't that hard.

61
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,263
I used the same root kit
we used to infect E Corp.

62
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:03,695
All I need to do is access a terminal
on their network and plug it in.

63
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,535
This is not what we set out to do!

64
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:08,368
Whiterose isn't dead
until her machine is!

65
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:10,816
Since when did her
machine become our goal?

66
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:12,943
You don't get it, do you?

67
00:06:15,614 --> 00:06:17,373
That's where all of this started!

68
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:30,209
You go down this path, it'll never end.

69
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:33,839
It'll always be something else.

70
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:35,872
Another symbol to destroy,

71
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,709
more people to save.

72
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:41,180
This is an endless war.

73
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:44,725
At a certain point,

74
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:46,393
we gotta move on.

75
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,079
Maybe you should go with them.

76
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:11,070
Please don't shut me out now.

77
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:13,476
I'm not shutting you out.

78
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:16,756
I want to do this one on my own.

79
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:36,196
Hey.

80
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:38,324
You're in the wrong place.

81
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:57,999
Usually I hand pick someone
to do the introductions,

82
00:16:58,001 --> 00:17:01,177
but I felt that unnecessary
since we've already met.

83
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,141
Please, have a seat.

84
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:13,314
This isn't gonna work on me.

85
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:17,110
What are you referring to?

86
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:23,316
The computer I used growing up.

87
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:26,068
A book my dad used to read.

88
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,204
You even got Qwerty here somehow.

89
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:32,083
It may have worked on Angela,

90
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,419
but your brainwashing
isn't gonna work on me.

91
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:41,259
This procedure has never
been about brainwashing.

92
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:45,388
It is about helping you
come to an understanding.

93
00:17:53,514 --> 00:17:54,764
What's in the box?

94
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:58,392
I had a lot of pain growing up.

95
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:01,946
I wasn't born who I was meant to be,

96
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:05,191
and it cost me a lot.

97
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:08,235
It cost me my one true love.

98
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:13,908
It cost me the life I was
owed, the world I deserved.

99
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,127
You're not answering my question.

100
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,371
This world around us, I'm tired of it.

101
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:20,679
I'm tired of the pain it causes.

102
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,057
I'm tired of the disappointment it is,

103
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,469
and all I've been trying to do, Elliot,

104
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:28,973
all I ever wanted was to finally bring

105
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,883
an end to that dysfunction

106
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:34,553
and deliver us a better world.

107
00:18:45,148 --> 00:18:46,815
You don't want to help the world.

108
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:48,326
You want to destroy it.

109
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:53,998
You want to destroy it
because you hate people

110
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,493
for what they've done to you,

111
00:18:57,495 --> 00:19:00,621
and you can't look past that
to actually see the good in it.

112
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:12,633
Elliot, please.

113
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,522
Don't make me laugh.

114
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:22,527
You think I'm the one that
wants to destroy the world?

115
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:25,604
I'm the one that hates people?

116
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:28,149
That can't see the good in it?

117
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:30,721
Look around you.

118
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:32,464
Everywhere we turn,

119
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:37,491
all we see is spite from
our so-called fellow man.

120
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:39,413
Every day we turn on the news,

121
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,704
we're constantly told by our leaders,

122
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:43,998
our scientists, our religions

123
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,335
that our world is crumbling,
and that we are the problem.

124
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:51,881
We are the root of
everything that is wrong,

125
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:54,225
that we don't stand a chance.

126
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:57,105
We are told this so
much that self-hatred

127
00:19:57,108 --> 00:20:00,723
is no longer considered
an anomaly but a given,

128
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:04,186
and yet you dare point the finger at me

129
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:07,071
when I try to bring order to its chaos?

130
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:12,243
When I have sacrificed
everything to make it better?

131
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,409
Please!

132
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:23,913
Don't make me laugh.

133
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:35,766
On the contrary,

134
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:40,262
it is my love for people that drives me.

135
00:20:40,264 --> 00:20:43,849
It always has been, because I know,

136
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:48,729
deep in every person's heart...

137
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:51,565
They are trying to be good.

138
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:58,289
They were just dealt a bad
hand by a world unfit for us

139
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:03,536
so please don't make me fucking laugh

140
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:07,640
and accuse me of hating
people when you, Elliot,

141
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:10,968
wear that hate like a badge of honor!

142
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,014
Shall I remind you of your group's name?

143
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:25,975
Admit it.

144
00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:29,055
Hatred has been your anthem,

145
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:31,174
not mine.

146
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:41,985
You're right.

147
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:43,569
I hate people.

148
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,790
I'm scared of them.

149
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:53,553
I've been scared of them
practically my whole life.

150
00:21:55,923 --> 00:22:00,489
People I loved... people I trusted...

151
00:22:00,492 --> 00:22:03,396
have done their absolute worst to me.

152
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:10,918
And for a long time,
that's all I ever knew.

153
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:17,943
So, yeah, I called my group fsociety,

154
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:22,123
because you know what? Fuck society.

155
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:27,536
Society deserves to
be hated for everything

156
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:30,506
you said they did and more.

157
00:22:32,668 --> 00:22:34,543
Fuck every last one of them

158
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:37,722
for what we've all been through.

159
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:51,027
But then there are
some people out there...

160
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:56,732
And it doesn't happen a lot.

161
00:22:56,734 --> 00:22:58,270
It's rare.

162
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:04,076
But they refuse to let you hate them.

163
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:11,255
In fact, they care
about you in spite of it.

164
00:23:11,258 --> 00:23:14,921
And the really special ones,

165
00:23:14,924 --> 00:23:19,260
they're relentless at it.

166
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:21,673
Doesn't matter what you do to them.

167
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:25,936
They take it and care about you anyway.

168
00:23:27,892 --> 00:23:30,224
They don't abandon you,

169
00:23:30,226 --> 00:23:33,653
no matter how many
reasons you give them.

170
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:38,436
No matter how much you're

171
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:42,033
practically begging them to leave.

172
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:50,252
And you wanna know why?

173
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:58,636
Because they feel something
for me that I can't.

174
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:18,906
They love me.

175
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:33,912
And for all the pain I've been through,

176
00:24:33,914 --> 00:24:37,791
that heals me.

177
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:40,502
Maybe not instantly.

178
00:24:40,504 --> 00:24:42,671
Maybe not even for a long time,

179
00:24:42,673 --> 00:24:46,967
but it heals.

180
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:50,137
And, yeah, there are setbacks.

181
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:54,767
We do fucked up things to each other.

182
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:58,854
And we hurt each other,
and it gets messy,

183
00:24:58,856 --> 00:25:02,149
but that's just us,

184
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:06,111
in any world you're in.

185
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:09,448
And, yeah, you're right.

186
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:14,328
We're all told we don't stand a chance,

187
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,373
and yet we stand.

188
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:24,129
We break, but we keep going,

189
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:28,726
and that is not a flaw.

190
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:32,638
That's what makes us.

191
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,117
So, no, I will not
give up on this world.

192
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:41,395
And if you can't see why,

193
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:45,150
then I speak for everyone when I say,

194
00:25:45,152 --> 00:25:47,069
fuck you!

195
00:25:55,877 --> 00:25:58,127
Pity.

196
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,706
I thought we shared a vision.

197
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:02,334
What is that?

198
00:26:02,336 --> 00:26:04,248
It appears the plant is losing power

199
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:06,213
- to the cooling system.
- Why?

200
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:07,442
As you can imagine,

201
00:26:07,445 --> 00:26:10,063
my machine requires a
significant amount of water,

202
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:12,845
so it has to draw all the plant's power,

203
00:26:12,847 --> 00:26:14,721
including its backup generators.

204
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:16,265
You turned it on?

205
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:18,100
Of course I have.

206
00:26:18,102 --> 00:26:21,395
- We're on a very tight schedule.
- Your machine.

207
00:26:21,397 --> 00:26:23,948
It won't work. I installed malware.

208
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,858
Yes, we discovered your breach.

209
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,451
How do you think we found you?

210
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,619
Then you know it already executed.

211
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:32,197
Except for the fact that my
machine was already running

212
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:34,533
by the time you installed
your little exploit.

213
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:36,034
No, you don't understand.

214
00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:39,630
Earlier you accused
me of being a murderer,

215
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:43,861
but soon you will see all
those lives that have been lost

216
00:26:43,864 --> 00:26:45,227
so that we could get to this point

217
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,461
will not be in vain.

218
00:26:46,463 --> 00:26:48,380
In fact, they won't be lost at all.

219
00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:51,800
They will all be found again
as soon as this world around us

220
00:26:51,802 --> 00:26:55,554
transforms into a parallel world.

221
00:26:55,556 --> 00:26:58,148
A world where we were
meant to be all along.

222
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,934
The machine can't run
here, and you know that.

223
00:27:00,936 --> 00:27:02,486
It's going to cause a meltdown.

224
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:05,731
Which is why I have been
trying to move my project.

225
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:08,734
Our tests here were quite
limited in proximity,

226
00:27:08,736 --> 00:27:10,652
however you left me no choice.

227
00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:12,329
Haven't you killed enough people?

228
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:16,408
Nobody will be killed.
The opposite, actually.

229
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,410
We will be reborn as new,

230
00:27:18,412 --> 00:27:22,006
finally liberated from the
horrific and brutal past

231
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,999
that we've been shackled to for so long.

232
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:25,918
You can't do this.

233
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,393
You said you loved people,

234
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,899
but you're not giving them a choice.

235
00:27:28,902 --> 00:27:29,985
You're not liberating them.

236
00:27:29,988 --> 00:27:31,297
You're forcing this on them.

237
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,009
I am giving them a choice.

238
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,096
That's why you're here.

239
00:27:38,098 --> 00:27:42,192
I'm going to show you
what I showed Angela.

240
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:45,812
What do you mean?

241
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:48,649
All I ever wanted from you, Elliot,

242
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:50,261
was your belief.

243
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:55,822
What are you gonna do with that?

244
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:59,117
I have learned to
listen when time speaks.

245
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,108
Our paths were too precisely
linked to this moment

246
00:28:03,111 --> 00:28:04,998
for there not to be a reason.

247
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,132
This is why.

248
00:28:06,135 --> 00:28:08,098
You get to decide.

249
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:10,235
Then I'm telling you, don't do this!

250
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:39,914
I don't know what the fuck to do.

251
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:42,035
We need to figure out
the code to this door.

252
00:28:44,271 --> 00:28:45,601
Try that phone.

253
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:47,581
See if you can get an outside line.

254
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:53,931
<i>- Zero five zero nine.
- Zero five zero nine.</i>

255
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,675
<i>Zero five zero nine.</i>

256
00:28:56,677 --> 00:28:58,930
- Anything?
<i>- Zero five zero nine.</i>

257
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:02,749
Zero five zero nine.

258
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:06,600
<i>Zero five zero nine.</i>

259
00:29:14,722 --> 00:29:16,172
Let's go!

260
00:29:16,175 --> 00:29:18,294
There's an access tunnel down the hall.

261
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:22,575
_

262
00:29:22,578 --> 00:29:24,911
If we leave,

263
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:27,399
the nuclear reactor's gonna melt down.

264
00:29:27,402 --> 00:29:29,583
Which is why we need to
get as far fucking away

265
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:30,792
from here as possible.

266
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:32,469
If we don't stop this,

267
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,463
the meltdown will
destroy the whole town.

268
00:29:34,465 --> 00:29:36,131
You wanna stop the meltdown?

269
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:38,117
How the fuck are we gonna do that?

270
00:29:41,055 --> 00:29:43,306
She said she gave me a choice.

271
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,478
We don't have time for this shit.

272
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:58,987
I don't think this is just a game.

273
00:29:58,989 --> 00:30:01,948
This place is gonna blow!

274
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,618
This is an override process
to turn off the machine.

275
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:09,876
_

276
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:18,049
_

277
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:22,121

278
00:30:25,628 --> 00:30:27,153
_

279
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:31,994
_

280
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:40,838
_

281
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,864
_

282
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:50,424
We've gotta get the fuck out of here!

283
00:30:51,754 --> 00:30:53,596
_

284
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:56,862

285
00:30:58,746 --> 00:31:00,297

286
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,712

287
00:31:06,288 --> 00:31:07,947
_

288
00:31:08,415 --> 00:31:12,075
_

289
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:23,363
It didn't work. The
alarms are still going.

290
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:24,752
We've gotta go!

291
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:29,586
No, I'm missing something.

292
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,913
She wanted us to win.

293
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:38,957
_

294
00:31:39,215 --> 00:31:43,145

295
00:31:50,822 --> 00:31:53,593

_

300
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:50,075
Did it work?

301
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:24,034
It's too late, isn't it?

302
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,353
I love you.

303
00:34:05,814 --> 00:34:07,694
I love you, too.

304
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:25,253
It's an exciting time in the world.

<i>You said that you needed to stay
up all night working on it.</i>

Oh, yeah. Sorry.

352
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,136
I don't know where my head is at.

353

<i>Are you okay?</i>

354
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:52,276
I woke up with a really bad headache.

355
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:58,115
<i>I see you also haven't made
any progress on packing.</i>

356
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,655
I bought tape.

357
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:10,628
<i>Okay, well, that's not nothing.</i>

358
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:13,246
<i>But it is almost nothing.</i>

359
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:19,420
My dad just E-mailed me.
I have to head into work.

360
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:22,050
<i>Don't tell me he's still
checking the traffic for you.</i>

361
00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:25,632
<i>You are such an only child.</i>

362
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:28,720
You know me.

363
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,433
So I'll talk to you later, okay?

364
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,884
<i>Elliot,</i>

365
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:37,396
<i>you're not keeping
anything from me, are you?</i>

366
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,525
What would I be keeping from you?

367
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,195
<i>I don't know.</i>

368
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,833
<i>You just seem different.</i>

369
00:38:52,412 --> 00:38:55,038
Must be this migraine I woke up with.

370
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,082
<i>Now it's a migraine?</i>

371
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,126
<i>I'll check in with you later?</i>

372
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,781
<i>Love you.</i>

373
00:39:00,784 --> 00:39:02,158
I love you.

374
00:39:02,161 --> 00:39:04,754
<i>Hey.</i>

375
00:39:04,757 --> 00:39:07,458
<i>Can't wait to marry you tomorrow.</i>

376
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,322
<i>Your call has been forwarded to an un...</i>

377
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,423
Mr. Robot, computer repair with a smile.

378
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,335
- This is Edward.
- Dad, where were you?

379
00:39:48,338 --> 00:39:50,094
You're not answering your cell.

380
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,971
Ah, you know I always loose
track of that thingamajig.

381
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,014
What's up, son?

382
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,266
I think Angela knows.

383
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,477
That's impossible.

384
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,020
<i>No, I just talked to her.</i>

385
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,106
She was acting suspicious.

386
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,441
<i>I'm sure you're
just being paranoid.</i>

387
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,110
There's no way she could know.

388
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,862
Dad, I have a feeling,

389
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:12,032
<i>if she finds out, it
will ruin everything.</i>

390
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,993
Okay. Calm down.

391
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,350
I'm sure you're just
nervous about tomorrow.

392
00:40:17,353 --> 00:40:18,831
Try to act normal.

393
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,625
There's no way she's
gonna find out, okay?

394
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,293
<i>You're right.</i>

395
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,878
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Just finishing up a call.

396
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,131
Be out in a jiff.

397
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,617
I got a customer. We still on for lunch?

398
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,969
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Okay.

399
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,137
See you soon.

400
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,473
<i>- Hey, Dad?</i>
- Yeah?

401
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,809
Thanks.

402
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,853
No problem.

403
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:44,148
I'm always here for you.

404
00:40:45,514 --> 00:40:47,481
Sorry for the wait. How can I help you?

405
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:53,391
Oh.

406
00:40:53,394 --> 00:40:55,493
There you are.

E Corp guys will be here any minute.

What?

416
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,527
For the meeting.

417
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,694
You just said E Corp.

418
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,281
Don't you mean F Corp?

419
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,789
F Corp.

420
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,240
Yeah, that's what I meant.

421
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,700
You nervous?

422
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,785
You're never like this
before presentation.

423
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:42,483
You're always stone cold.

424
00:41:42,486 --> 00:41:44,967
Yeah, I don't know. I'm
not myself today, man.

425
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:48,522
What's up, my dudes?

426

Ollie.

427
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:50,801
Yeah, I heard we were taking

428
00:41:50,804 --> 00:41:53,396
a swing at F Corp today, B-Moc.

429
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:55,719
- I'm sorry?
- B-Moc.

430
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:59,148
The Big Man on Campus.

431
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,133
- I don't think that's a thing.
- It might be a stupid thing.

432
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:04,228
Anyway, here's what's up.

433
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,313
I'm awesome at talking to people.

434
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,564
For real, though.

435
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,066
Lunches, dinners, drinks.

436
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,735
I could sell ice to an
Arab, sand to an Eskimo.

437
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,613
Yeah, you're not helping
yourself out there.

438
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,907
Unless you're experimenting
with some new form or racism.

439
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,619
I just want you to know I can
be an asset for when... not if...

440
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,621
but when you land this account.

441
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,798
What do you say?

442
00:42:25,801 --> 00:42:27,793
You know what? Don't
take my word for it.

443
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,253
I... I wanna take you out to lunch

444
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,004
and prove to you what I'm all about.

445
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,348
But not today, though.

446
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,607
I'm meeting my new girl, Stella B.

447
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:37,186
Don't tell the girls in the office.

448
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,932
Cool, man. Glad we did this.

449
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,642
Seriously.

450
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:47,363
Just pull up the debt and
look over all the slides.

451

<i>Let's build our future together...</i>

452
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,545
When you have lunch with him,

453
00:42:50,548 --> 00:42:52,775
will you please tell him
to never talk to me again?

454
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:56,488
<i>Together we can change
the world with F Corp.</i>

You all right?

Just make sure all the

Can Elliot and I have the room, please?

472
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:22,199
I appreciate your presentation,

473
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:25,377
but I don't think this
place is right for us.

474
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:31,467
And why is that?

475
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,933
Let me ask you something, Elliot.

476
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:45,272
What's the worst thing
about your life right now?

477
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,558
Well, the fact that you're
passing on us already,

478
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,143
I'd have to go with this meeting.

479
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,362
No, seriously.

480
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,947
Answer my question.

481
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,161
If I'm being honest...

482
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,866
The worst thing in my life...

483
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,170
Is also the best thing.

484
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,917
I get up every morning,

485
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,586
I play my records,

486
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,130
I get ready,

487
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:21,517
get my coffee, I come to work,

488
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:25,187
I'm stuck in a
repetitive, boring routine

489
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:28,148
that feels endless.

490
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:34,104
And, sure, I've imagined
what it would be like

491
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:38,942
to be someone with a more exciting life.

492
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,986
A risk-taker.

493
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:44,248
Someone more interesting.

494
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:50,712
But in the end, I know
I'm lucky to be where I am.

495
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:57,010
Please have a seat.

496
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:12,309
I also feel the same
about my life at F Corp.

497
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:15,613
It's the best and the worst
thing that happened to me.

498
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:19,858
And the reason why I
love my company so much

499
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,411
is because of the value we provide,

500
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:24,246
and people buy our products every day

501
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,485
because they trust us.

502
00:46:25,488 --> 00:46:27,583
F Corp is not only the
best thing in my life.

503
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:29,993
It's the best thing in everyone's lives,

504
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:33,163
but it could also be
the cause of our undoing

505
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,499
if I'm not careful.

506
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,376
So you see my dilemma here.

507
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:43,673
Tyrell, I pledge to you right now

508
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:46,384
that if you go with Allsafe,

509
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:50,606
the worst will never happen.

510
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:54,443
And how can you be so sure?

511
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:58,132
Because I've seen what
can happen to your company,

512
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,385
and I know how to prevent it.

513
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,598
You've seen what can
happen to my company?

514
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,934
Yes.

515
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,701
If you look through our packets,

516
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,453
we've created predictive models

517
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,038
for every possible attack vector...

518
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,541
No, no, Elliot.

519
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:21,151
I just wanna know you're on my side.

520
00:47:21,154 --> 00:47:23,196
Always.

521
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,593
Come on, son.

522
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:33,598
You just landed the biggest
fish there is... F Corp.

523
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,359
Celebrate!

524
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,321
Did you bring it?

525
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,020
A signed first-edition copy,

526
00:47:50,023 --> 00:47:51,448
just like you asked.

527
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,544
_

528
00:47:56,243 --> 00:47:58,044
_

529
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:00,861
Shoot.

530
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:05,422
I need to make sure Angela
isn't home when I drop it off.

531
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,224
I think her mom's there.

532
00:48:16,002 --> 00:48:17,267
Hello?

533
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,462
Emily?

534
00:48:20,971 --> 00:48:22,425
You there?

535
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,345
Weird.

536
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,247
She picked up and
then she hung up on me.

537
00:48:31,565 --> 00:48:33,014
I bet she's with Angela

538
00:48:33,017 --> 00:48:35,313
and doesn't want to spoil the surprise.

539
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,064
Come on.

540
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:39,089
Let's order. I'm hungry.

541
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,377
Forgot my wallet.

542
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,907
Must have left it at home this morning.

543
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,266
That's not like you.

544
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,719
Must be nerves.

545
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,017
Okay.

546
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,477
Here you go.

547
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,715
You should buy her some flowers, too.

548
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:06,199
But first, we feast.

549
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,703
So you'll be gone for a while?

550
00:49:12,706 --> 00:49:13,922
<i>I already told you.</i>

551
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:16,334
<i>Why do you keep asking me?</i>

552
00:49:16,337 --> 00:49:18,337
No reason.

553
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,922
<i>What are you up to?</i>

554
00:49:19,925 --> 00:49:21,142
Nothing.

555
00:49:23,662 --> 00:49:26,582
<i>You're up to something. I can tell.</i>

556
00:49:26,585 --> 00:49:28,209
Trust me.

557
00:49:28,212 --> 00:49:29,906
<i>I trust you.</i>

558
00:49:29,909 --> 00:49:31,753
<i>I just don't believe you.</i>

559
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:36,339
Your parents in town yet?

560
00:49:36,342 --> 00:49:38,451
<i>Uh, yeah, they were just at my place.</i>

561
00:49:38,454 --> 00:49:40,674
<i>I had to cancel lunch with
them because of work. Why?</i>

562
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:42,852
Your dad sure loves to drink.

563
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,521
<i>What's that?</i>

564
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,189
Never mind.

565
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:52,696
Hey, I'm sorry I was
acting weird this morning.

566
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:56,227
Just really excited about tomorrow.

567
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,656
<i>What's tomorrow, again?</i>

568
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:01,994
Mm.

569
00:50:01,997 --> 00:50:04,035
What could it be?

570
00:50:04,038 --> 00:50:07,309
<i>Well, I have a new Pilates instructor</i>

571
00:50:07,312 --> 00:50:08,682
<i>I want you to try out.</i>

572
00:50:08,685 --> 00:50:10,713
I'm not a big Pilates guy.

573
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:13,204
<i>Oh, we're trying that new sushi place</i>

574
00:50:13,207 --> 00:50:14,615
<i>in Chelsea finally?</i>

575
00:50:14,618 --> 00:50:17,438
Getting warmer.

576
00:50:18,795 --> 00:50:21,004
<i>We're finally getting married.</i>

577
00:50:21,007 --> 00:50:24,334
<i>That couldn't be it, could it?</i>

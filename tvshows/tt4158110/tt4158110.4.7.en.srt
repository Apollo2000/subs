00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:12,377
<i>When I was a kid
and my dad pushed me</i>

3
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:14,621
- <i>out the window...</i>
- Told you I was sorry.

4
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:16,048
You're just sick
and don't wanna admit it.

5
00:00:16,124 --> 00:00:18,008
- <i>You weren't pushed.</i>
- Shh.

6
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,510
You jumped.

7
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:22,346
<i>We got the access we needed</i>

8
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,222
<i>to transfer the money</i>

9
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:24,723
<i>from the bank's side.</i>

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,016
<i>We can rob them blind.</i>

11
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:27,770
<i>I don't want Elliot
to be my prisoner.</i>

12
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:30,020
I want him to be my partner.

13
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:32,689
<i>I gotta break him
so I can build him up.</i>

14
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,191
I see you now.

15
00:00:34,226 --> 00:00:36,360
That is how you own a nigga.

16
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:38,028
<i>I'm gonna break Elliot,</i>

17
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:40,531
and you're gonna be
my aluminum bat.

18
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:41,865
<i>Mr. Robot.</i>

19
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,535
That is how you break him.

20
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,036
<i>Elliot, I was kidnapped.</i>

21
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:47,371
<i>He wanted to know
everything about you.</i>

22
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:48,739
The universe got big plans

23
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:50,374
- for us, bruh.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

24
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:51,375
<i>I'm scared.</i>

25
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,511
Hey! Hey! Hey!

26
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,716
Boy's not picking up.

27
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:29,913
Okay, okay, okay.

28
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:31,415
I got you, man.

29
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,418
I didn't know that.
All right, I got you.

30
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:35,752
All right.

31
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:42,759
Yeah, you got me confused.

32
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:45,062
All right.
I got you, bro.

33
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:35,145
I've been waiting
for this moment

34
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,947
for a while now.

35
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,954
Sorry, just...

36
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,034
Didn't expect it to hit me
like this.

37
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,870
I'm all emotional and shit.

38
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:53,497
Told myself I'd keep it cool,
you know.

39
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,041
Told myself I wouldn't do
no fanboy shit like this,

40
00:02:56,118 --> 00:02:56,925
but I'm sorry, dude.

41
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,877
I just have so much respect
for your ass,

42
00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:00,638
it makes me all...

43
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,384
Yo, what's that word
those weird-ass Hasids use

44
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,885
for this shit?

45
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:08,345
Mm, "verklempt"?

46
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,855
That's it, verklempt.

47
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:14,026
You... well...

48
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,154
You like a hero to me.

49
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:21,358
A hero I did wrong,
not gonna lipstick that pig.

50
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,069
But it was a turning point
in my story nonetheless.

51
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:26,196
And something tells me
it was a turning point

52
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:28,082
in your story too.

53
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,178
Javi, make our guest here
more comfortable.

54
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:55,392
We're on the second floor
of a three-story walk-up,

55
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:57,728
two armed dopes
and a crazy meth head

56
00:03:57,763 --> 00:03:59,146
who thinks he's Deepak Chopra.

57
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,489
Only exit's the front door,

58
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:01,565
but I seem to remember

59
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,399
there's a fire escape
in the back.

60
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:03,483
Not thinking about

61
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,652
an escape plan right now.

62
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:06,987
Escape is the only
fucking thing

63
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,405
we should be thinking about.

64
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,157
Not until we find Krista.

65
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,659
Kiddo, need I remind you

66
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,828
about Dominican Psycho
over here?

67
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:18,081
Krista was just bait.
Now she's probably dead.

68
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:20,250
Well, we need to find out.

69
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:24,171
I just need to get him doing
what he loves to do best: talk.

70
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,631
- He'll tell us what we want...
- Yo!

71
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,392
You gonna say something?

72
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:33,731
It's been a minute.

73
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,900
How the fuck you been?

74
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:43,073
Truth is,
I'm... I'm a little confused.

75
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,318
You came looking for me
two months ago.

76
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:49,037
Why'd you wait until today
to make a move?

77
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:51,531
Well, if you must know,

78
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:55,794
I had to prepare,
set the stage for our meet.

79
00:04:57,239 --> 00:05:00,290
This shit is bigger
than Frost-Nixon, you know?

80
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:03,552
Had to be ready.

81
00:05:06,998 --> 00:05:08,766
Ready for what?

82
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:13,312
For you, bruh.

83
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:16,306
You a formidable adversary.

84
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:19,559
You ain't no corner bitch
I can stick my dick in.

85
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,945
Need to buy you dinner first.

86
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:26,983
That what this is, dinner?

87
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:30,153
Shit, nigga,
he trying to make a metaphor.

88
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,080
Yo, V, I thought you said
this kid a genius, bro.

89
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:34,825
I swear to God, if you don't
shut the fuck up...

90
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,159
How about we just cut
the bullshit

91
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,295
and you tell me why I'm here?

92
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:56,346
After our unfortunate...

93
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,223
parting of ways,

94
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,392
I had to return back home
to the DR.

95
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:02,602
Hadn't been back there
since I was little...

96
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,273
When people didn't think
much of me.

97
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:10,527
It actually reminded me
of a dream I used to have,

98
00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:12,696
that I would one day
own that island,

99
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:16,032
that the very land
everyone walked on,

100
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,169
slept on, fucked on
would be mine.

101
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,372
Settle in, this looks like
it's gonna be a long one.

102
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:29,254
Except there I was,

103
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:32,048
back in the DR
with those same motherfuckers

104
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,717
who didn't believe in me...

105
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,219
said I wouldn't amount
to nothing.

106
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:38,555
This time, they was wrong.

107
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:39,931
I had tools now.

108
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:41,600
I had vision
I didn't have before.

109
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:43,059
So I started hustling.

110
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,063
I set up shop...

111
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,565
couple of corners
here and there.

112
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,400
At first, on my own.

113
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:53,403
Then a few other niggas
got impressed, joined in.

114
00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:55,071
Couple of block battles

115
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,948
but nothing
we couldn't handle.

116
00:06:57,025 --> 00:07:00,076
Matter of fact,
it was easier than ever.

117
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,507
And like a virus,
we multiplied.

118
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,504
Within 43 days,
I took down every gang.

119
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:17,260
From there, it was easy
to get to the politicians,

120
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:21,306
especially with Five/Nine
pounding their wallets.

121
00:07:21,383 --> 00:07:23,475
Once that domino fell,
we took control

122
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:27,938
of all the favelas in both
the Dominican and Haiti.

123
00:07:31,393 --> 00:07:33,318
I was running everything
and everyone

124
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:35,695
from the president
to the campesino.

125
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,197
And by day 87,

126
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,583
I finally had my own island.

127
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,880
Then on the 88th day,

128
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:46,423
I got bored.

129
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,125
I had everything I ever wanted,

130
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,386
but all I felt was emptiness.

131
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:54,965
One day, Javi over here

132
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,841
brings this crazy old shaman

133
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:58,468
who says he can help me.

134
00:07:58,503 --> 00:08:00,804
So I said,
"All right, let him in."

135
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,140
He sat my ass down,
prepared me a cocktail

136
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,809
of this powder... pink powder,

137
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:08,812
red blood mixed in
with titty milk.

138
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:11,690
He looked into my eyes
and said,

139
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:13,733
"You're asleep.

140
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,986
It's time you wake up."

141
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,824
Then held the cup to my lips.

142
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,130
You wanna know what I did,
Elliot?

143
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,166
I gulped that shit down.

144
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:32,585
And then...

145
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,754
I just gotta be real
with you, bruh...

146
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,173
I shit myself.

147
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,675
Then I puked myself.

148
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,344
Back and forth, back and forth,
shitting, puking,

149
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:44,597
till all the shit and puke
poured out of me.

150
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:49,769
The shaman then takes my face
in his hands, says...

151
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,522
"It's time for you to go home."

152
00:08:57,312 --> 00:08:58,695
I didn't know what to think.

153
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,114
I told him...

154
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,241
I was home.

155
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:07,037
And then it hit me
why I was feeling empty

156
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,456
that whole time.

157
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,583
Home isn't where you from.

158
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:15,211
It's... where you supposed
to be.

159
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,551
I was born Dominican,
but here...

160
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:25,805
New York...

161
00:09:31,513 --> 00:09:33,813
This is my home.

162
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,982
This is where I thrived.

163
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:39,069
And there I laid,
weeping like a bitch,

164
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:40,570
telling the shaman
I could never go back.

165
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:43,156
I failed there.
That path was closed to me.

166
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,950
Shaman shook his head no.

167
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:52,665
Told me I had to reopen
that path,

168
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,251
that I had to reconcile

169
00:09:55,286 --> 00:09:57,087
with the man who closed it.

170
00:09:57,122 --> 00:10:01,725
For he was meant to be
my partner.

171
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,678
Then and only then
can I go home again.

172
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:14,738
That's why we sitting here
right now, Elliot.

173
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:18,408
That's why I came back.

174
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:21,611
I owned the wrong island.

175
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:26,449
I'm gonna take over New York,

176
00:10:26,484 --> 00:10:30,587
and you gonna be my side
when I do.

177
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:39,262
So what you think?

178
00:10:45,137 --> 00:10:46,770
Where's Krista?

179
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:06,489
You want me to partner with you
for anything,

180
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:09,367
first things first,
I need to know where Krista is.

181
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,329
You forget we played
this game already?

182
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:15,674
That's why I'm asking.

183
00:11:22,123 --> 00:11:26,009
Now that I think about it,
this was Isaac's knife.

184
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:27,853
You remember him, don't you?

185
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,355
My brother.

186
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:35,602
This is probably the same one
he did your girl Shayla with.

187
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:45,245
No one here wants to see
no rerun, bruh.

188
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,668
You're not gonna kill Krista.

189
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:54,838
She's the only thing
you got over me.

190
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,542
Can't believe,
with all that enlightenment,

191
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,753
you'd come back here
to be just as stupid

192
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:03,638
as you were last time.

193
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:06,349
Stupid?

194
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:09,552
Last time we did this dance,

195
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:11,855
I got everything I wanted,
didn't I?

196
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,226
You didn't get me.

197
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,204
Where is she?

198
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,916
She good, bruh.

199
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:34,911
Show me.

200
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:52,729
Poor Elliot...

201
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,268
Always caught up
worrying about the pussy.

202
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,906
Is that all you want?

203
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,359
Simple meet and greet?

204
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:10,413
Okay.

205
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,491
But then after that,

206
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:16,995
I'm gonna want my own
special introduction.

207
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:36,556
- Elliot.
- Are you okay?

208
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,141
No, no, no, no, we ain't
having no sidebar here.

209
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,310
Alls I said was
you could see her.

210
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:45,815
You need to let her go.

211
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,909
You already
on to your second demand

212
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:49,995
and you ain't even honored
the first.

213
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,081
I said I need an introduction.

214
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,296
What introduction?

215
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,256
Mr. Robot.

216
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:21,109
I don't know
what you're talking about.

217
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:22,277
Nah, come on, dude.

218
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:23,686
Let's move past the bullshit.

219
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:25,605
I got your therapist here,
remember?

220
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,782
I know everything about you.

221
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,954
So tell me,
how do we get him out?

222
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:37,867
How does this voodoo shit work,
exactly?

223
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:41,204
Do we say "Mr. Robot"
three times in the mirror?

224
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,246
Rub a lamp?

225
00:14:42,323 --> 00:14:44,466
Roll your eyes back,
play Bob Marley,

226
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:46,209
light some candles?

227
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,794
What do you want from him?

228
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,138
Alls I wanna do
is talk to him.

229
00:14:51,216 --> 00:14:53,475
How 'bout you let her go
and then we'll talk?

230
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:00,807
Remember what I said,
anything happens to her...

231
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,734
Don't touch her!

232
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:04,778
Don't worry,
I'm not touching.

233
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,573
I'm just taking
her temperature.

234
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:10,658
But Javi over here,

235
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:12,660
he just got out of a bad
relationship.

236
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:14,404
He need a rebound.

237
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:16,239
He been looking
at Miss Krista all day

238
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,074
with them hungry eyes.

239
00:15:18,109 --> 00:15:19,575
He gotta eat sometime.

240
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,577
You can't blame him, can you?

241
00:15:21,612 --> 00:15:23,913
We all gotta eat, Elliot.

242
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:25,340
You wanna talk?

243
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:29,886
Let's talk.

244
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:40,897
How do I know it's you?
I didn't see no puff of smoke.

245
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:44,100
Let's get one thing straight,
fuck-face.

246
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,185
I ain't no puff of smoke.

247
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,288
Welcome to the party,
Mr. Robot.

248
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:07,382
I'm not here to party.

249
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,292
You wanna talk,
get to it already.

250
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:11,711
- What do you want?
- Yo.

251
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:12,887
I don't care who the fuck
you are.

252
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:14,297
You need to calm it down,
homey.

253
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:16,141
I'm not talking to you.

254
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,982
Where that courage now,
bitch?

255
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,446
Right fucking here.

256
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,900
Let's keep this friendly.

257
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,859
Yo, V, I ain't trying...

258
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,077
Peanuts, God damn it,

259
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:37,996
I said put the gun down!

260
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:50,249
What kind of name
is Mr. Robot anyway?

261
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,594
Some Nickelodeon bullshit, man.

262
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:57,098
What kind of operation
you running here, exactly?

263
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:05,940
- What's so funny?
- Nothing, man.

264
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:07,033
It's just a trip.

265
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:09,685
It's like I'm really talking
to another person.

266
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,770
That's because you are.

267
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,190
So stop wasting my time,
and start talking.

268
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:15,617
I thought we was talking.

269
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:17,527
What am I doing here?

270
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,621
I don't know.

271
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:21,956
That's a good question.

272
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:33,843
Why... are... you...

273
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:39,015
Here?

274
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:44,720
When assholes like you
come around,

275
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:47,557
I make sure he has someone
on his side.

276
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:50,485
Oh, what that make you, then,
the muscle?

277
00:17:50,562 --> 00:17:52,153
His protection?

278
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,239
Something like that.

279
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,321
How you think that's going?

280
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:11,414
Don't matter, though.

281
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:14,092
I ain't here to judge
your job performance.

282
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:19,681
I didn't ask what you do.
I asked you why you were here.

283
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:23,351
How did you start?

284
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,901
- He needed me.
- Why?

285
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,603
If you here to protect him,

286
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,938
that means he got hurt
real bad.

287
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:37,532
I just wanna know
what scared him so much

288
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:40,368
that he needed your bitch ass
to come to the rescue.

289
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:44,947
This is cute and all,
but I gotta be real with you.

290
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:49,368
You're too stupid to do this.

291
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,786
What is it that you think
I'm doing, exactly?

292
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,538
Trying to get inside my head.

293
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:53,789
Oh, I already in there.

294
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,957
You're so sure of yourself.

295
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,384
- I am.
- Why's that?

296
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:58,386
'Cause there's a method

297
00:18:58,463 --> 00:18:59,721
to Elliot's madness,

298
00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:01,889
and I think you know
what it is.

299
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:04,216
You wanna know what it is?

300
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,885
I'll tell you what it is.

301
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,562
He's smart.
He's angry.

302
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:08,888
Put those two things together,

303
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,064
you stay the fuck out
of the way.

304
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:11,140
Yeah, blah, blah, blah,
that's your spin zone

305
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,234
"Fox & Friends."

306
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:15,811
How 'bout you give me
the real headline?

307
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,901
You read her file.
Put two and two together.

308
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,403
His father died when he was
eight years old.

309
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:28,249
His mother treated him
like her own personal ashtray.

310
00:19:28,326 --> 00:19:30,493
He needed someone to help him
cope with the world.

311
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,753
Voilà, you got me.

312
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:33,254
No doubt, shit's heavy,

313
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:34,756
but it ain't actionable.

314
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:36,248
I need details.

315
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,760
How 'bout we skip
the psychobabble

316
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:41,304
and get to why
we're really here?

317
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:44,599
You said you wanna own
this island

318
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:46,601
and you need my help.

319
00:19:47,628 --> 00:19:51,439
So this job interview
isn't about my credentials.

320
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:53,191
It's about yours.

321
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,851
And like I said,
with your operation,

322
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:57,603
I don't know if you could run
a White Castle,

323
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,780
much less New York.

324
00:19:58,856 --> 00:19:59,855
You want me to work for you.

325
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,775
It's clear you don't wanna
force me into it,

326
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,778
which means you gotta start
convincing me.

327
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,833
Convincing you?

328
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,795
Let's not play dumb.

329
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,957
If she told you about me,

330
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,843
I gotta think she told you
about Five/Nine.

331
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,380
So you know the things
I've done,

332
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:27,141
things I've been able
to pull off.

333
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,478
I'm not someone
you push around with a gun.

334
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:31,971
I am the gun.

335
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,983
So yeah,
you gotta convince me.

336
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,653
Because right now,

337
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,646
if this is your master vision,

338
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,231
do yourself a favor.

339
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,158
Go back to that
little shaman of yours

340
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:46,235
and shit some more,
because you're clearly

341
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,704
still full of it.

342
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:59,841
I wanna own every corner
of this city.

343
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,503
I want them all
pushing my product.

344
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:07,006
And I mean everyone,
not just no drug dealers.

345
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,258
Every business,
every storefront,

346
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:12,428
every billboard in this city,
every train in every tunnel,

347
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:13,596
every pig in blue.

348
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,098
From the night whores
walking the streets

349
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,359
to the day whores
on the Upper East Side,

350
00:21:18,436 --> 00:21:21,687
from the rapists down in lockup
to the ones in the high-rises.

351
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:25,858
I wanna roll five boroughs
into one Dominican blunt,

352
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:28,444
smoke that shit
as I count my cash

353
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:31,781
and ash on these Warbuckses'
white, bald heads.

354
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,041
That is my master vision,

355
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:38,370
and that... Mr. Robot,

356
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,288
is what I want.

357
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:41,707
I wanna own this island.

358
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,765
So let me see if I got this.

359
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,769
You wanna get into real estate.

360
00:21:53,838 --> 00:21:54,970
Is that it?

361
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,306
Is that what all this is about?

362
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:00,902
Is that really your
groundbreaking epiphany here?

363
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:03,145
No.

364
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,282
That can't really be it, is it?

365
00:22:07,518 --> 00:22:08,818
In your word salad,

366
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,486
I heard something
about drug dealing.

367
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,863
Thing is, Pfizer and Eli
are a few billion ahead of you,

368
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,157
and they can buy your death
with the same half-cent

369
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,251
it costs them to make a pill.

370
00:22:17,328 --> 00:22:18,661
You wanna get
into billboards?

371
00:22:18,696 --> 00:22:19,912
Download Photoshop.

372
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:22,248
Make yourself
a cute portfolio.

373
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,000
Stores,
with the debt everyone's in,

374
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,594
I'm sure they'll
gladly give 'em to you,

375
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:29,839
in which case, you'll just
be owned by their banks.

376
00:22:29,874 --> 00:22:31,265
Trains are even more bankrupt,

377
00:22:31,342 --> 00:22:33,509
and don't even get me started
on the NYPD.

378
00:22:33,544 --> 00:22:36,011
Even that blunt you wanna roll
is gonna be marked up

379
00:22:36,046 --> 00:22:37,263
by Big Tobacco itself.

380
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:41,183
Point is, this city's one
big, fat credit card bill,

381
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,352
and you wanna pay it,
all so you can, what,

382
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:45,571
be another suit
with a mortgage?

383
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,608
Unless you're after
a monopoly on stupidity,

384
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,027
please tell me you have more.

385
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:54,196
Please tell me you didn't
waste my time

386
00:22:54,231 --> 00:22:56,031
when you could have just
enrolled in some night classes

387
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:57,867
at the Brooklyn School
of Real Estate

388
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,618
and left me the fuck out of it.

389
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:03,965
This ain't about being
no landlord, bruh.

390
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,967
This is about power.

391
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:09,470
Power is just an asshole
stuffed with money.

392
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:11,472
And while you're most
definitely all stocked up

393
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,141
on asshole,
money, you just don't got.

394
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:15,643
I gots plenty
start-up capital.

395
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,303
Whatever you have
isn't enough, not for this.

396
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,305
Ain't no thing.
I can stick up a few joints.

397
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:19,972
How much we talking?

398
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,557
Even asking that means

399
00:23:21,592 --> 00:23:23,392
you're thinking too small.

400
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:26,562
Behind every great fortune,
there lies a great crime.

401
00:23:26,597 --> 00:23:29,648
That is the corporate motto
of these United States.

402
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:32,827
You wanna oink-oink with all
the other capitalist pigs?

403
00:23:32,904 --> 00:23:34,996
It's not about how much money.

404
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,990
It's about robbing money
itself.

405
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:45,748
And you can do that for me?

406
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,427
I think I have a plan
that could help you.

407
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,922
But step one of anything
we do together

408
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,298
is always gonna be
let her go.

409
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,472
But didn't you say she was
the only thing I got over you?

410
00:24:05,436 --> 00:24:10,239
Javi, Peanuts, am I deaf,
or did he not say that?

411
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,441
Yeah, I heard it.

412
00:24:12,476 --> 00:24:14,443
Yeah, I heard it,
most definitely.

413
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,539
Hey, you need to recollect
correct, Nickelodeon.

414
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:22,785
So if I let my only
insurance policy go,

415
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,211
then how am I gonna trust

416
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:25,955
that this money
gonna come to me

417
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:29,458
or that this plan of yours
even exists in the first place?

418
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:33,796
You know, come to think of it,
she didn't even trust you.

419
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:35,556
It was in her notes.

420
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:38,392
Ain't that true, Miss Krista?

421
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:41,062
What was it again?
How'd phrase it?

422
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,973
"Patient is extremely guarded,

423
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,944
which presents a barrier
to honest processing."

424
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,906
That don't sound too good,
Mr. Robot.

425
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:57,403
If she can't trust you,
why should I?

426
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,581
I'll show you.

427
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,833
Show me what?

428
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,751
My plan,

429
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,253
the hack.

430
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,180
It's going down tonight.

431
00:25:17,174 --> 00:25:18,757
You let me do it,
I'll steal more money

432
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,434
than you know what to do with.

433
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:23,980
That'll be a better partner
to you than anyone else.

434
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:29,518
Why you willing to part
with all this dough?

435
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,278
I don't give a shit
about money.

436
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:33,698
I just wanna take it from them.

437
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,413
How exactly
you gonna do that?

438
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:44,583
I'll show you.

439
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:52,541
I got it all on my laptop:

440
00:25:52,576 --> 00:25:56,628
bank statements,
account balances,

441
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,431
the whole exploit.

442
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,231
Javi, go get his bag.

443
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:32,164
You know,
you don't need Mr. Robot.

444
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,339
He barks a lot,

445
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,673
but he ain't the bite

446
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:44,185
behind all that havoc
you wreaked, is he?

447
00:26:50,267 --> 00:26:53,069
See, that right there,
that's why you my dude.

448
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,030
I'm more scared of you
than him.

449
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:02,369
You got something to show me,

450
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:04,279
then let the show begin.

451
00:28:10,214 --> 00:28:12,439
Look at all them zeros.

452
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:14,183
I can't even count 'em all.

453
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:19,521
Oh, yeah,
that's stadium money, nigga.

454
00:28:19,556 --> 00:28:21,356
The fuck is stadium money?

455
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:25,235
Yo.

456
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:30,240
Yo, Javi, come take a look.

457
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:38,007
Oh, shit.

458
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:41,635
Yo, you right,
that is stadium money.

459
00:28:41,712 --> 00:28:43,629
Bro, oh.

460
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,158
You don't got it in you.

461
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:25,512
I got your bullets, bitch.

462
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:33,971
You really think I didn't
have Javi check your bag

463
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:35,856
the second we grabbed you?

464
00:29:38,936 --> 00:29:40,361
Oh.

465
00:29:40,437 --> 00:29:43,572
Maybe I was wrong
about you, bruh.

466
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:46,533
Old Elliot never would have
picked up that gun,

467
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,609
let alone pulled the trigger.

468
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:50,153
I like to think I had
something to do

469
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,281
with that little mean streak
in you.

470
00:29:52,316 --> 00:29:54,700
You make me proud,

471
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,086
but I can see we still have
some work to do.

472
00:29:58,155 --> 00:30:00,497
It wasn't him. It was me.
It was my fuckup.

473
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:02,049
You don't need
to take it out on him.

474
00:30:02,126 --> 00:30:03,500
Take it out on you, him,

475
00:30:03,577 --> 00:30:04,543
the fuck does it matter?

476
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,628
Same brain gets the bullet,
don't it?

477
00:30:06,663 --> 00:30:07,879
I had a lapse,
doesn't mean you give up

478
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,172
on all those zeros.

479
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:10,215
That's still very fucking real.

480
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:11,216
Nah, man.

481
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:12,301
None of this is real,

482
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:13,719
not until we have trust.

483
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,304
We can figure this out.
You just gotta

484
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:17,014
put the gun down.

485
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,400
Stop being so thirsty, bruh.

486
00:30:19,476 --> 00:30:21,893
I ain't trying to talk to ya
anyway.

487
00:30:23,347 --> 00:30:24,980
Where you going?

488
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,650
Let's go, sweet thing.

489
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,954
Let's go.

490
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:36,250
Wait, stop.

491
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:38,327
You wanna throw away
all that money for nothing?

492
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:39,586
I'm not the one
who just tried to shoot me

493
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:40,871
for no goddamn reason.

494
00:30:40,947 --> 00:30:43,424
No goddamn reason? You would
have done the same thing.

495
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,875
<i>Incorrecto,</i> cuz.

496
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:47,044
I would have made sure
to kill your ass,

497
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,712
like I'm about to do to her.

498
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:51,098
Hey, you hurt her,
you might as well kill me next.

499
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:52,174
You lose everything.

500
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,385
That does appear to be
the pickle we're in.

501
00:30:55,462 --> 00:30:57,929
So what to do?
What to do?

502
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,890
We go back to the plan
before I fucked everything up.

503
00:30:59,966 --> 00:31:02,943
Yesterday's news, bruh.
Been there, done that.

504
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,686
Wait! Wait, wait!

505
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:07,606
After I steal the money,
I'll be your partner, okay?

506
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,783
I will be your partner.
I will do whatever you want.

507
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,693
Warmer, but not quite there
since I know for sure

508
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,560
I can't trust you.

509
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:14,279
Wait, wait, wait!
There's gotta be

510
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,238
something we can figure out!

511
00:31:15,315 --> 00:31:16,623
Tell me why I shouldn't
shoot her.

512
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,367
Because she's a good person.

513
00:31:18,402 --> 00:31:19,701
No, tell me why
I shouldn't shoot her.

514
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:21,203
She doesn't deserve this!

515
00:31:21,238 --> 00:31:22,629
Details, motherfucker!

516
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:24,631
Tell me why I shouldn't
shoot her!

517
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:26,425
Because I need her!

518
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,384
She helps me.

519
00:31:40,257 --> 00:31:44,026
Oh... I get it now.

520
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:47,404
She your shaman.

521
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,034
The fuck does that mean?

522
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:56,738
It means now we're getting
much warmer.

523
00:31:56,773 --> 00:31:59,458
See, I've been going about this
the wrong way.

524
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:03,754
I thought you would give me
the answer I was looking for.

525
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:08,675
But maybe I was
the wrong person

526
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:10,803
asking the question.

527
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:29,571
Have a seat, bruh.

528
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:33,108
What is this?

529
00:32:33,143 --> 00:32:35,861
We gonna have a little
therapy session.

530
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,363
It's finally time you saw
that you and I

531
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,582
are destined to be partners.

532
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,118
You ready?

533
00:32:44,905 --> 00:32:47,122
Didn't I tell you
to sit your ass down?

534
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:52,711
We gonna find out
what's going on

535
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,763
inside that little head
of yours.

536
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:57,766
Ain't that right, honey bear?

537
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,844
What do you expect me to do,
exactly?

538
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:03,889
I expect you to pick up
where you last left off.

539
00:33:07,177 --> 00:33:08,810
Why you looking at me
like that?

540
00:33:08,845 --> 00:33:10,312
Don't you do this for a living?

541
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,898
- Yes, but...
- I don't wanna hear no buts.

542
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,150
Alls I wanna hear
is this therapy session

543
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:16,401
getting kicked off.

544
00:33:17,938 --> 00:33:22,082
You sick, sadistic
piece of shit.

545
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,825
What's the point of this?

546
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,077
You're just gonna kill us
anyway.

547
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:28,413
It's fine, Krista.
Let's just do what he wants.

548
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:30,540
Elliot, he's just trying to
find another way to hurt you.

549
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:32,667
He just wants a show.

550
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:34,085
Let's give him a show.

551
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:35,003
That's right.

552
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:42,344
I'll be sitting right here,

553
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,937
eating my popcorn.

554
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,558
What you're asking for
is impossible.

555
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:51,102
You won't get anything
out of this.

556
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:55,565
This only works
in a controlled setting,

557
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:57,609
alone,

558
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,370
just me and him.

559
00:34:04,568 --> 00:34:07,536
Peanuts, Javi, take a walk.

560
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:08,962
What?

561
00:34:10,073 --> 00:34:11,039
Nah, nigga.

562
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:13,208
Now I wanna know what happens.

563
00:34:13,243 --> 00:34:14,876
Yeah, dawg,
I'm kinda curious

564
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:15,961
where you going
with all of this.

565
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,380
I said take a fucking walk!

566
00:34:28,425 --> 00:34:30,058
Nasty cabbage ass,

567
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:32,361
had to go on
and ruin everything.

568
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:44,322
That's as alone
as you gonna get.

569
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,324
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

570
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:47,334
You're pointing a gun at me.

571
00:34:47,411 --> 00:34:48,910
You're forcing me to talk
to one of my pati...

572
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,337
Ah!

573
00:34:50,414 --> 00:34:52,214
Okay, okay, calm down.

574
00:34:53,366 --> 00:34:55,333
Krista, look at me.

575
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,296
Ask me some questions.
It's easy.

576
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:01,631
You know how to do this,
same as we always do.

577
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,177
Come on, Krista.

578
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,471
It's fine.
Pretend he's not even here.

579
00:35:08,548 --> 00:35:10,932
Listen to your boy.

580
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:13,268
Come on, you can do it.

581
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:14,936
Look at me.

582
00:35:14,971 --> 00:35:16,947
Let's talk about my mom.

583
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:19,691
She just passed away.

584
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:21,368
Why don't we talk about that?

585
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:26,364
Are you okay?

586
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,292
I'm fine.

587
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:34,006
You know we didn't talk a lot,
so it didn't hit me that hard.

588
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:38,051
I think it got to Darlene,
though.

589
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:42,889
Come on, keep going.

590
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:45,934
There's gotta be something more
you wanna ask me.

591
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:50,772
Now that you've had some time
to think about it...

592
00:35:52,175 --> 00:35:54,818
How are you feeling
about her death?

593
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,156
I haven't thought about it
that much.

594
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,242
Is that a bad thing?

595
00:36:04,187 --> 00:36:06,905
Well, there was
a lot of pain there.

596
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,407
- She hurt you...
- Yeah, yeah!

597
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:12,869
I know all this.
That's all old shit.

598
00:36:12,946 --> 00:36:16,998
There's no gold there.
I need that 24-karat.

599
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:19,334
I don't know how to do
what you want.

600
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,919
You said Elliot's got
a secret

601
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,337
and the only way
I can unlock it

602
00:36:22,372 --> 00:36:24,756
is to find out
why Mr. Robot exists.

603
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,438
What's he talking about?

604
00:36:32,465 --> 00:36:34,891
She sold us out
is what he's talking about.

605
00:36:34,968 --> 00:36:36,685
I'm sorry.
I had to tell him something.

606
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,278
I didn't know what else to say.

607
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:42,190
What did you tell him?

608
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,109
Look, we are running
out of time here.

609
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,777
We gotta start thinking
about an exit strategy

610
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:47,904
and fast,
while his pals are gone.

611
00:36:47,981 --> 00:36:49,572
Do you know
what she's talking about?

612
00:36:49,649 --> 00:36:50,699
What does it matter?
Did you hear what I said?

613
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,033
- We gotta get out of here.
- Here.

614
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:53,410
- Let me help you start.
- Those are my private charts.

615
00:36:53,486 --> 00:36:56,121
"Elliot's preoccupation
with Mr. Robot

616
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,747
"suggests an emotional
component

617
00:36:57,824 --> 00:36:58,873
- to the relationship"...
- Don't do this.

618
00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:00,542
Oh, you upset.
I'm sorry.

619
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:03,044
Maybe I should stop.
How 'bout it, Elliot?

620
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:05,755
You sure you don't wanna know
what she wrote in here?

621
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:07,257
He's fucking with you.

622
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:08,850
He's trying to play
his little mind games.

623
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,021
She doesn't want me
to hear this.

624
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:17,892
Why?

625
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,894
Who gives a shit?

626
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:22,155
We gotta focus on a way
out of here.

627
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,368
You don't want me
to hear this either.

628
00:37:30,607 --> 00:37:32,240
Keep reading.

629
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:34,659
No, don't do this.
Elliot, it's not a good idea.

630
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,120
I said keep reading.

631
00:37:37,197 --> 00:37:39,247
Ooh, I like this one.

632
00:37:39,282 --> 00:37:41,750
"Strained relationship
with Mr. Robot...

633

keeps us from exploring
the root of his condition."

634
00:37:46,206 --> 00:37:48,098
What does that mean?

635
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:50,925
Answer the man's question.

636
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,594
Tell me what that means.

637
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,971
Elliot, this is not
how this is supposed to work.

638
00:37:55,048 --> 00:37:56,681
She's right.
This... this has to stop.

639
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:57,640
"Childhood trauma,

640

follow up on window event."

641
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:06,616
What's so important
about this window anyway?

642
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:12,781
You won't talk.

643
00:38:12,816 --> 00:38:14,449
No problem.
Let me look it up.

644
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:15,992
- Let's see, window...
- Stop it.

645
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:18,328
Just stop it!
These are just my notes.

646
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:20,455
You're not supposed to hear
any of this in this way.

647
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:23,541
I don't give a shit
what I'm supposed to hear.

648
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:24,876
What are you hiding?

649
00:38:27,163 --> 00:38:29,264
Is this about Mr. Robot?

650
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,343
No, not Mr. Robot.

651
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:35,637
Darlene?

652
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:36,888
No.

653
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,306
Who, then?

654
00:38:38,341 --> 00:38:39,682
Don't say anything.

655
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:42,018
What does this have to do
with the window?

656
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:44,112
No one was there
except my father.

657
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:48,116
Is this about my father?

658
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:53,321
- What about him?
- Please don't make me do this.

659
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:55,240
- What about him?
- Don't make me do this.

660
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,034
- Krista, don't.
- Shut up.

661
00:38:58,111 --> 00:39:01,204
Krista,
there's no use holding back.

662
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:03,131
Tell me what's going on.

663
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:08,044
The day he pushed you
out the window...

664
00:39:08,121 --> 00:39:10,255
My dad didn't push me.
I... I jumped.

665
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,714
Darlene told me.
I remembered it wrong.

666
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:14,759
- See, she doesn't even know...
- I said shut up!

667
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:21,349
- Keep going.
- Let's get it, bruh.

668
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,522
Why is it you think
you... you can't recall

669
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,566
that memory so clearly?

670
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:33,528
Pay attention.

671
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,446
Miss Krista's asking you
questions.

672
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:38,199
I don't know why.
Do you?

673
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:44,038
- Answer me.
- I... I... I don't know.

674
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,541
But I...

675
00:39:46,576 --> 00:39:48,877
I can ask you details
about that day

676
00:39:48,912 --> 00:39:50,628
to help you remember.

677
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,514
Like what?

678
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:56,050
What were you doing
that day in your room?

679
00:39:56,085 --> 00:39:59,929
Uh... Darlene and I
were building a snowman.

680
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:02,640
We went upstairs
to look for my camera.

681
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:05,360
And did you find the camera?

682
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,238
Darlene told me we didn't.

683
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,274
What else did Darlene say?

684
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:15,653
She said... that we heard
my dad coming

685
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:18,373
and I told her to hide
in the closet.

686
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,659
Then what happened?

687
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:27,624
Uh, he walked in the door
and I grabbed my baseball bat.

688
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,084
And then?

689
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:33,338
I started swinging it
and yelling,

690
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,590
smashing everything
in the room,

691
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,675
and then I jumped
out the window.

692
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:40,428
Do you actually remember
these events,

693
00:40:40,463 --> 00:40:42,689
or did Darlene tell you this?

694
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:45,191
Darlene.

695
00:40:46,636 --> 00:40:49,938
Is that similar to other
instances in your life

696
00:40:49,973 --> 00:40:52,023
when you've lost time?

697
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:57,787
No, only when Mr. Robot
takes over.

698
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,282
Do you think it's possible

699
00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:04,619
Mr. Robot is the reason
why you can't remember?

700
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,375
What's she talking about?

701
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:13,461
You didn't exist
when I was a kid.

702
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:14,796
Did you?

703
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,049
That's not important.

704
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,301
What's important
is that I'm here now.

705
00:41:20,336 --> 00:41:22,553
Stop lying to me.
How long have you been here?

706
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:24,472
Don't you see
what's happening?

707
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:27,392
She pushed us apart before.
She's doing it again.

708
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,144
Answer the question!
How long?

709
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:32,480
How long have you been
messing with my head?

710
00:41:32,515 --> 00:41:34,399
What do you want me to say?

711
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,067
I've been here
since the first day

712
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:37,151
that I was needed.

713
00:41:37,186 --> 00:41:40,655
I exist for a reason.
I always have.

714
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:43,324
It's always been my job
to protect him.

715
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,160
You know this isn't the way.
This is dangerous.

716
00:41:46,195 --> 00:41:50,164
You can't do this to him.
Please do not do this to him.

717
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:52,083
He's not supposed to know.

718
00:41:56,873 --> 00:41:58,339
Know what?

719
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:03,428
Elliot, do you believe
Mr. Robot when he says

720
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,263
he's here to protect you?

721
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:11,152
Yes.

722
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,731
So if it's possible
that it could have been

723
00:42:14,807 --> 00:42:18,109
Mr. Robot that day,
do you know why he might have

724
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,029
picked up that bat
and jumped out that window?

725
00:42:21,064 --> 00:42:24,032
Why are we going through
all these details again?

726
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:25,283
Get to the fucking point!

727
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:28,202
That's it, bruh.
Find that poison.

728
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:32,206
Do you think Mr. Robot
was protecting you

729
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,125
from something in that moment?

730
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,382
Like what?

731
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:46,637
You said you did this when
your father came into the room.

732
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:54,062
Elliot, look at me.

733
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,652
Why do you think you had
such a strong reaction

734
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:04,739
when your father
came into the room?

735
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:18,219
I don't know.

736
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:22,098
I don't know.

737
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:25,259
I... I can't...

738
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,263
I can't remember.

739
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,268
Elliot.

740
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:41,776
Maybe...

741
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:46,155
I was scared.

742
00:43:48,568 --> 00:43:50,627
What were you scared of?

743
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,790
Krista... you do this,

744
00:43:55,825 --> 00:43:57,500
it will destroy him.

745
00:43:57,577 --> 00:43:59,460
Elliot,
what were you scared of?

746
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:01,712
He already told you
that he can't...

747
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,005
Remember.

748
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:06,801
His father.

749
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:20,022
That's it, right?
You were scared of your father.

750
00:44:22,101 --> 00:44:24,318
No.

751
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,238
Why would I be scared of him?

752
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:29,073
He was my friend.

753
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,085
I can't protect you anymore.

754
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:55,933
Why would I be scared
of my father?

755
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:01,105
Do you recall a time...

756
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:06,277
Your father ever hurt you?

757
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:08,454
Hurt me?

758
00:45:09,649 --> 00:45:12,074
He would never hurt me.

759
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:16,379
I told you,
he was... he was my friend.

760
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:19,749
He was my only friend.

761
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:25,796
Then what made you scared
that day?

762
00:45:28,084 --> 00:45:29,559
I wasn't.

763
00:45:30,503 --> 00:45:32,428
You told me you were scared.

764
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,808
I, uh...

765
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,143
Is that what I said?

766
00:45:42,348 --> 00:45:46,234
Um... I'm... I'm confused.

767
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:53,991
You and your sister
were in the room.

768
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:00,081
You heard
your father's footsteps.

769
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:03,751
No.

770
00:46:06,122 --> 00:46:09,340
You think it's possible
you hid Darlene in the closet

771
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:10,967
to keep her safe?

772
00:46:12,628 --> 00:46:14,178
No.

773
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:18,849
Your dad walked
into the room...

774
00:46:21,804 --> 00:46:23,854
No.

775
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,406
No.

776
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:29,110
You grabbed a bat
to defend yourself.

777
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,153
No, no, no, no.

778
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,286
You yelled at him
to get away.

779
00:46:38,321 --> 00:46:40,121
You swung the bat at him.

780
00:46:40,156 --> 00:46:40,955
No.

781
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,386
And you escaped
the only way you knew how.

782
00:46:54,086 --> 00:46:57,221
Why were you afraid
of your father?

783
00:47:04,096 --> 00:47:09,066
Were you afraid he was going
to ask you to do something...

784
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:11,652
you didn't want to do?

785
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,880
Yes.

786
00:47:34,794 --> 00:47:37,603
Do you remember
what he asked you to do?

787
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:54,445
Yes, I remember.

788
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,033
Elliot.

789
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:04,288
Did your father
sexually molest you?

790
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:15,966
Yes.

791
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:17,862
Elliot, I'm so sorry
that happened to you.

792
00:49:23,453 --> 00:49:26,370
Elliot, hear me, bruh.

793
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:29,165
I know it feels like
you're all alone right now,

794
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:29,899
but you're not.

795
00:49:29,976 --> 00:49:33,594
I know this pain, your pain.

796
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:37,506
It's okay to feel
whatever you're feeling,

797
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,467
and if you can hear me,

798
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:42,979
I want you to know you don't
gotta be scared no more.

799
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,941
Don't... don't touch me.

800
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:49,894
Don't touch me.

801
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:03,157
My brother...

802
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:05,159
Stop.

803
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:06,869
Please stop.

804
00:50:06,946 --> 00:50:09,714
You know there's nothing
you can do to stop this.

805
00:50:11,116 --> 00:50:13,176
I don't know
how to live with this.

806
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:15,669
I don't wanna live with this.

807
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,763
- Not an option you got.
- Yes!

808
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,341
Yes, there is.
There is.

809
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:24,220
There has to be,
because I can't do this.

810
00:50:24,296 --> 00:50:24,954
I can't.

811
00:50:25,031 --> 00:50:26,597
I know it hurts right now,

812
00:50:26,608 --> 00:50:28,107
but you purging
all that poison.

813
00:50:28,184 --> 00:50:30,443
Soon you can be your true self.

814
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,987
My true self?

815
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,565
I don't know who that is.

816
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:39,026
I don't know who that is!

817
00:50:39,061 --> 00:50:41,028
That's because
you're still holding in

818
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:43,998
all the anger and sadness.

819
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,876
What do I do?

820
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:52,965
Right there,
that's what you do.

821
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:54,792
You let it out.

822
00:50:56,712 --> 00:50:58,546
Amen.

823
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,424
Once you let it all go,

824
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:04,969
then you can finally meet
the real you.

825
00:51:09,091 --> 00:51:11,817
This ain't a death.

826
00:51:11,894 --> 00:51:14,311
Elliot, you've been reborn.

827
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,242
Why?

828
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:22,578
Why?

829
00:51:23,147 --> 00:51:25,281
Why... why... why... why
would he do...

830
00:51:25,357 --> 00:51:26,490
There is no why.

831
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:31,045
You weren't the one in control.

832
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:34,415
I know it's hard to go on

833
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:38,586
when you're carrying this
around, but you can.

834
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:42,098
How?

835
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,226
You don't carry it alone.

836
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,313
I'm here with you, bruh.

837
00:51:53,886 --> 00:51:55,269
You.

838
00:51:57,773 --> 00:51:59,815
You did this.

839
00:51:59,892 --> 00:52:02,034
You did this to me.

840
00:52:03,395 --> 00:52:05,871
- I did it for you.
- No.

841
00:52:05,948 --> 00:52:07,448
No, I don't believe you!

842
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:10,876
I did this because I could
see this wound on your face.

843
00:52:10,953 --> 00:52:12,286
From the first time I met you,

844
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:14,288
I just wanted to show you
the light.

845
00:52:14,365 --> 00:52:17,124
- This is bullshit!
- Ain't no bullshit, bruh.

846
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:18,959
The only thing
that happened just now

847
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:20,294
is that you finally
faced the truth.

848
00:52:20,329 --> 00:52:23,097
You've been looking away
from your whole life.

849
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,315
And now that you know
the truth...

850
00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:35,643
You can use it.

851
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:48,238
I know 'cause I done it.

852
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:51,042
I been through it.

853
00:52:53,162 --> 00:52:56,038
My ma...

854
00:52:56,115 --> 00:52:57,998
she used to pass me around
to her friends

855
00:52:58,075 --> 00:52:59,416
when she'd go out
to get high,

856
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:01,335
and let's just say
her friends...

857
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,506
They took a lot from me.

858
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:12,846
Your dad,
he took a lot from you too,

859
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,107
but he didn't
take everything.

860
00:53:15,184 --> 00:53:18,519
See, this shit
you went through,

861
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,613
most people don't know
pain like that.

862
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,022
They never will.

863
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:25,359
And if they did,
it would end them.

864
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:30,030
But the people who dig in,

865
00:53:30,065 --> 00:53:31,907
the ones who keep surviving,

866
00:53:31,984 --> 00:53:33,867
those are the ones
you can't beat.

867
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:36,620
Those are the ones
no one can beat.

868
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:40,675
Because once you've weathered
a storm like yours...

869
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:45,087
You become the storm.

870
00:53:48,551 --> 00:53:51,051
You hear me?

871
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:55,723
You are the storm.

872
00:54:01,823 --> 00:54:06,066
And it's the rest of the world
that needs to run for cover.

873
00:54:13,192 --> 00:54:16,210
Your power is beautiful.

874
00:54:17,863 --> 00:54:20,622
Elliot...

875
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:22,499
it's special.

876
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:31,058
Don't you believe that?

877
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:34,178
I don't know.

878
00:54:36,715 --> 00:54:38,766
Do you wanna believe it?

879
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:44,188
I just...

880
00:54:48,393 --> 00:54:50,578
I don't wanna be alone anymore.

881
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,114
Hey.

882
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:00,954
You're not alone.

883
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:15,636
I see you now.

884
00:56:04,275 --> 00:56:09,275

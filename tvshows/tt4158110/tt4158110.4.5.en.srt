1
00:00:03,394 --> 00:00:05,005
- Get in.
- What about him?

2
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:06,310
- He's dead.

3
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:08,530
- Krista.
- Leave me alone.

4
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:09,661
- She our girl.

5
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:11,272
She knows something
I gotta know.

6
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:13,143
- We are very pleased
that you are back to work.

7
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:14,405
Let us know if there's
anything you need,

8
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,016
and we'll do the same.

9
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,192
- He's an Irish mobster
out of Hell's Kitchen.

10
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:20,498
- If I can find a way
to rob the Deus Group,

11
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:22,109
Whiterose loses everything.

12
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:24,415
- I got into Olivia's
Cyprus National Bank account.

13
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:26,156
I can see all
the Deus account numbers,

14
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,419
but she's not authorized
to transfer anything,

15
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:31,205
which means we are gonna have
to break into Virtual Realty

16
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:32,684
and get on their servers.

17
00:00:32,728 --> 00:00:34,295
- Schedule the meeting
for tomorrow.

18
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:36,297
- There's no way we'll be able
to get the Deus Group

19
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,298
together so quickly.

20
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:38,734
- I have lost everyone.

21
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:40,170
The only one I have left
is my brother,

22
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:42,433
who treats me
like absolute shit,

23
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:44,348
but I'm really worried
about him right now.

24
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:46,133
I'm afraid he might be dead.

25
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:49,658
- Tyrell.

26
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:53,227
- Burn the van
and all the evidence.
